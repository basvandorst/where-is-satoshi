Yes, number of transactions would be an equally stupid metric for judging success of a coin.
Edit: not "equally" stupid, but still *very* stupid metric

It would be really really really nice to have a wallet implementation that did this for you. A toggle switch for "double spend" and then you scan a qr and it does the extra address generation and management for you in the background.

I totally disagree. It's total BS.
Imagine this. You fork BTC and create a new coin, we'll call it BTC\_DominanceDrainCoin. As long as you record ONE single transaction that gets reported and tracked, even 0.00001 BTC\_DDC coin gets traded for say $0.00001, that's all it takes to invent a market cap of $17M for that BTC\_DDC.
If that happens, then BTC dominance is reduced by $17M. Absolutely meaningless metric.

It is very stupid to use the BTC dominance metric as some measure of BTC success. It is not. It's equivalent to counting the number of transactions at a given random hour of the day and using that as a metric for overall success.

\*\*Yes\*\*, did eventually get it working. See my top-level comment
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:26:22
Ok, finally got it working. These are the steps that worked for me
(1) Check balance, \*\*username\*\* not email, and this required an old password (not current)
(2) Login, \*\*username\*\* not email, this required my most recent MtGox password
(3) For the 2FA setup, make sure you do the following:
(3.1) The email address at the top has to be the one you used for your MtGox account
(3.2) You can set a new password
(3.3) Name and Address details I had to mess with for a long time, I think they have to match exactly what you used when setting up your MtGox account, but this could be a wrong assumption I tried a million times and it could've been something else that let me in.
(3.4) Toward the bottom of the form, when it asks for your mt gox credentials, this is your \*\*email\*\* from (3.1)
(3.5) The password should be your most recent MtGox password, the one you used in step (2)
(3.6) I think the security questions can be new
(4) Afterward, you have to log in again, but for me the password I entered in 3.2 did not work and I had to use the password from (2)
(5) The rest was straight forward and worked, 2FA code sent to email, I used the confirmation code, got a 2FA key and qr code to use and was able to log in. It had me change my password
(6) Now I can log in using \*\*email\*\* and the password set in (5), and 2FA is requested / working
(7) It took two tries to get it to accept my input for the rehabilitation claim, but did get a status of "filed" eventually.
Good Luck and may Satoshi be with you.
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:20:42
Does anyone know whether all of those required fields must match exactly what you originally signed up with? Or can you use a new email address / password combo at the top since it looks like you're setting up new info?

This is generally a pretty neutral development for the cryptoverse. The one advantage is that Apple may be able to bridge the crypto conversion barrier by saying, "Yes, you can fund your apple bucks with crypto", sure they will need to figure out the legal side of doing this but Apple is powerful enough that this could happen.
One thing this DOES do for crypto is it gets people more used to seeing a number on their phone, getting used to the idea that that's money, and using an electronic device to pay for stuff instead of a physical plastic card (yes, I understand that's an option) or cash.
That privacy nonsense at the end though,,, give me a break. People will believe it though. Until all of that data is sold to Cambridge Analytica. Of course then everyone will get in a tizzy and be really upset, but not change their behavior at all. It is what it is I guess.

At the time you offer to triple their reward, no one knows you're interested in 51%ing, so it's not useless and no one knows it WILL be useless until it's too late (after the 51% attacks) And people can't respond instantly, some hardware owners are asleep during the 51%, others are disengaged anyhow.


ANY 51% attack that's successful on BTC will destroy its value and confidence in the technology. ALL of the mainstream news will be "bitcoin attacked" "funds lost" etc and if it's true, the damage is done and no one is going to trust it for decades. (And more importantly, why should they?)


I totally agree that this **is** what will happen. The problem I see is that if an attack is successful, it will take us 20 years to get here and back to the confidence BTC enjoys today. That is a massive setback in my view and I feel like PREVENTING an attack like this would be worth it.

CSW has a very small cult following. Outside of that I think he could tell the most benign and true story about anything and most people would question it.
He could go on record saying, "When I was in highschool I went to a dance two years in a row with the same girl." and most of us would be skeptical. Not because the story is unbelievable, but the source.
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:45:44


No problem, at least you acknowledged it. I get too much of this on this sub.


I agree with this, but US is already pack leader here, already the wealthiest and has the advantage that most of the world utilizes USD for international trade and as a benchmark, so it would be really detrimental to lose that position of controlling THE dominant fiat.


You lost me here. Can you extrapolate some? Wealth == value, and they don't come from nowhere. When wealth exists where it didn't previously something created the value it doesn't just appear. We are in agreement that Bitcoin as an asset and as a technology are indisputably valuable.
I agree that a state government attacking Bitcoin is a net negative. If it succeeds the whole world loses out. BUT, that doesn't necessarily mean that it wasn't good (read "convenient" or "profitable") for the power structure doing the attacking.
When Bitcoin survives, yes the whole world benefits. But,, US and China are way ahead of everyone else right now, and Bitcoin may reduce their relative position with one another or with others. The way I see it, right now, US is at 85 on the scale of 1 to 100 in terms of wealth, maybe China is at 75, and the next highest is at 45 and most are around 20-30 range. (I'm just picking numbers, but what I'm saying is that there are a few at the top of the spectrum and most are at the bottom). Bitcoin very well may put US at 95, China at 92, the next highest at 80, and everyone else in the 60s. Yes, on the whole this is fantastic for everyone. But, it means that US and China do not enjoy the same level of power over others that they once did.


Yes, I totally and completely agree with this. And yes to ban or over regulate is ONLY going to prevent you from accelerating with everyone else. But if you can DESTROY it for everyone, then you maintain the status quo and don't mess with the hierarchy you're at the top of and so many are so far below.

Yeah, I've seen probably most of Andreas' videos. His response isn't unreasonable.
However, his response is operating under the predicate of a nation state "building their own super rigs" or creating their own hash power.


Sure, I concede that. And his follow up about the BTC community just booting connections from those IP's disallowing them from being a part of the network. Yes, that's all great.
BUT! What I've suggested is coercing the pools and doing it covertly. Not "covert chip manufacturing" ONLY covert coercion of a few pool managers. Paying them off and making it worth their while.

This isn't true. You nor I, nor anyone else can "take" anyone else's coins. That's kind of the premise of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-10-10 15:23:10
This is totally wrong. I've already gone through the math. The block reward over the course of weeks is pennies for a nation state. A nation state could pay a 100% premium on all ASIC hardware AND pay you a year's worth of mining rewards. Mining rewards are $12M daily, ALL mining rewards, 100% of them.
The US government BUDGETS to GIVE AWAY more than 10X that amount in foreign aid. Let that sink in. In foreign aid, that's money taken OUT of the pocket of US citizens and the amount is more than 10X ALL block rewards.
This is NOT a lot of money for a nation state to spend on destroying BTC.
@_date: 2018-10-10 14:49:51
This is definitely the best answer I've seen so far. Most have said, "Nope, not possible" without a real explanation or "Nope, too expensive", which is obviously not true.
I think you're right that at the end of the day it's a double-spend or series of double-spends. I agree that the damage done by a double-spend is limited, but I still think the optics would be very bad. All mainstream news would be about "the bitcoin hack" etc, and that your money isn't safe there. 
But you're right, most of the BTC are actually both safe and unaffected, so most of the people in BTC now would still be happy to use it and if they were doing big transactions maybe waiting 12 blocks or 100 before considering it set in stone.
Good answer, thanks.
@_date: 2018-10-31 16:30:51
Yeah, we agree on this. I think a very good way to spur adoption would be to kick it off not by charging people, but by paying them.
i.e. sites that already make money from advertisements, if there's an API in place when you visit the site it could prompt the user with a simple message: "Hey! when you visit this site, our ads generate revenue. We are passing some of that on to you. And you start seeing an indicator spinning and hovering it shows your satoshi's balance start increasing.. Even if it's basically nothing, milli-satoshi's start trickling in"  
Then other sites can say, "Hey, you have X milli-satoshi, do you can remove ads for 32 nano-satoshi per second while you're on our site.
If we start doing things this way on the extremely small scale, it becomes a way of life. This has unquestionably already happened with ads, you go to YouTube and watch your video and if you're not on YouTube Red, you get an ad in the middle of your video and you just expect it. You are exchanging your time, attention, and privacy for the video you want to be watching it's just become so common place that people don't really think about it.
Once the system is in place and in use and people are use to it, now the bigger purchases (by bigger I still mean pennies per article / pennies per minute of streaming) are expected and known enough that it no longer produces anxiety, it's just part of how society functions.

@_date: 2018-10-10 14:39:49
I agree this is the answer, but in the mean time? Right now, none of those top pools are decentralized so the risk exists today. People moving their hash power to decentralized pools would need to be incentivized somehow, and the risk (obviously, since most people are on centralized pools) is insufficient.
@_date: 2018-10-10 14:45:29


I agree, but a state easily has this much money. Easily. Do the math and look at a national budget. This much money doesn't even show on a pie chart that big.


Again, I get that it's expensive, but not insurmountably so.
The US has the biggest stake in this since USD is the dominant fiat, they have much more stake in maintaining fiat dominance.

Most people are willing to trust their browser to hold their banking passwords (I don't). But I think it's a pretty easy stretch (even for me) to trust a browser with maybe anywhere from $10-$100 worth of crypto. If the browser has a good mechanism kind of like phones have for apps like: "site X wants to charge you 11 sat/s for streaming, do you want to allow? There'll be an indicator in the tab header and in the top-right corner etc to indicate you are being charged at that rate currently"
Then you allow it and go on with your day. News sites that currently have paywalls, you just authorize sales in general and then when you visit a specific article it says, "Hey, to view this article it's 150sat, continue?" and for sites you frequent often (wikipedia for instance) you just say, yes, always pay the fee (up to a threshold, i.e. 400sat) any time I visit the site so it doesn't bother you with a prompt.
As long as this has a good UI with good default configurations AND can have the thresholds modified easily, it would change the way the web is used. It would even be super easy to say "remove ads for this session for 12sat" type of behavior. 
Yes, it means you're spending money every time you use the internet. But for those of us who would rather pay with money than with privacy,,, this makes a LOT of sense.

That's true from a private perspective. But for US, they have literally TRILLIONS of dollars at stake over the next decade, or two, or three by maintaining their position as dominant fiat.
BTC could threaten that position. So while it's not "profitable", destroying confidence in BTC as a technology / monetary system is definitely desirable and in US best interest. Likewise for an authoritarian state that doesn't want their citizens having access to an alternative like BTC.
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:26:41
Yeah, I concede that it's not this simple. That process would be too visible, once the fact that that is taking place is leaked, the community can be very very cautious with transactions, waiting 16 or 100 blocks before considering something "confirmed" and block peer connections by IP, etc. Total confiscation or coercion by force would not be covert enough.
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:15:00


Actually I do.


They don't actually have to commandeer or buy the ASICS themselves, really all they have to do is buy or commandeer the product / their application, that's hash power, and it is already controlled by the top pools. So the problem has just been reduced from buying / controlling hardware to buying and controlling pools (much easier).


They wouldn't, they bypass having to do this by coercing the pools.
Most asics contribute to pools, and largely this is unattended. A mining pool can change its mining software without any pool contributor knowing (they do actually do this). So what your asic is doing, the actual task it's computing is entirely transparent to the asic owner. Primarily the owner of asics is concerned with whether they're getting the correct payouts at the correct frequency and most are not actually looking at what computations the asic is running.


Yeah, re-read the post. You're not understanding.
@_date: 2018-10-10 14:38:13


Admittedly, I'm completely ignorant. But setting that aside, your answer isn't an answer. You're saying that state actors would not do this because "they have skin in the game". They have stake in BTC? Stake they care about? Listen to yourself. We're talking about a TOTAL market cap of $100B. That is nothing. US runs deficits 10X this value.
A state has MUCH more stake in seeing their own fiat succeed than in seeing BTC succeed.
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:36:03
Do the math with actual numbers. You'll see, it's not that expensive in the grand scheme of things.
BTC block rewards for an entire year do not even total the amount of money US government GIVES AWAY in foreign aid. Do the math, I'm not wrong. You're speculating that "it'll be more expensive", but you don't seem to really understand the scale of a superpower nation state budget.
The entire BTC market cap is nothing.

Exactly. Even being easy (if it were) is insufficient, there has to be some other benefit.  
It'll come though. 
There's a brick and mortar grocery store near me which recently began handing customers a scanner to scan items as they shop and fill their basket (and bag with reusable bags). Then pay at the end. This same brand literally stopped accepting VISA credit cards this month due to fees.
Now,, it is not a big step at all to (1) allow shoppers to scan / shop with an app instead of the in-store device. (2) allow various methods of payment.
If they can process crypto-payments at near zero fee, this makes sense for everyone. It's coming.

You can buy small amounts every week or month.
Another thing I've started doing is converting spare change. I don't spend cash much, but when I do I put the spare change in a jar. When that jar fills up I'm going to convert it to crypto. It's not much but it's more than nothing.
Finally, sell your stuff. You MUST have some stuff that you don't use. Do some cleaning and post your things on sale online. Post them for "crypto only", but at a really good price. And I mean really good, make it attractive enough that people NOT into crypto yet will go to the trouble of getting some crypto just to buy your item at the steep discount. Granted, this requires you to have something of value to sell.

(1) This definitely needs a REST api (didn't see one) that is really simple and really well defined. If defined well and accessibly, wallets could optionally use your service to inform their fee basis. Another benefit of a good well-defined API means maybe some other developers with other mechanisms could be used and users could select which fee source to use and it's ambiguous to the wallet which service it's using.
(2) This also seems like a service that could be monetized, at least in the wallet case. This is the sort of service that no one minds paying .001sat per price check, most of us are so supportive of new stuff in crypto-land we'd probably pay 1sat per price check if the payment mechanism were trivial to approve once / use repeatedly. Just dreaming here.
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:17:26
That's one characterization, but you're ignoring how things happen on a timeline. If you're watching competitive sports for example, say a basketball game and team 1 and 2 are dead even and then you see team 1 losing and losing and losing, and the whole arena says, "It's over, team 1 is dead, can't possibly win", then you start seeing a comeback. Team 1 starts scoring, scoring,,,, not scoring, but also not letting the other team score. Then scoring scoring,,,, defending well,,, scoring again. At some point people have to realize, "Wait a minute, what if team 1 comes back!?" It doesn't really matter that they're down 75%, 65%, 55%, the fact that they turned it around is what's interesting.
That's what I'm saying about BTC, mainstream believed that it was headed to zero. From 20k to 15k to 12k, to 10k to 8k to 6k, to 5k, to 4k, to 3k, it WAS headed to zero and everyone _knew_ it.
Everyone _knows_ it is still going to zero,,, right? The fact that it's made traction in the other direction is the amazing thing. Not only made traction, but held the ground for more than a day.
In the basketball example as team 1 starts coming back, you change your mind about their viability long before they're winning. You don't wait until they're winning to resolve your dissonance that they're "headed to zero",, after 30 minutes of consistent good defense,,, not only defense but actually closing the gap you have to start reconciling your belief that they were "headed to zero".
The analogy also falls apart because there's a time limit on a basketball game. Whereas there's no time limit here. Every minute BTC is above zero is a testament to its longevity. It's not a race against the clock at all, the clock only serves to ensure its long-term viability.

Look at what trading volume is for BTC.
Now calculate how much of that is miners selling off BTC they've mined.
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:37:35
This is really important to think about. But take note of a few important facts.
There was a time when BTC was worth less than a penny. At that time, transaction fees were still in the zero-fee range, and even if you paid a satoshi transaction fee, you're looking at $0.0000000001 for the transaction fee. So recognize that fact that BTC layer 1 transaction fees are not "inherently" high.
It is a misconception that "fees are high" is just the nature of BTC. The fact is,, BTC became valuable. It became worth 1$, then $10, then $100, and so on. Now it's worth a lot and people **value** it. Transaction throughput is a limited resource, AND BTC is valuable and moving (transferring from one person to another) BTC is valuable. So the transaction fee is a reflection of the value of BTC, it's not just that way because people decided fees would be high.


This is the question you (literally you, personally) have to ask yourself, and I have to decide for myself. We can switch to another coin and decide we'll use DOGE instead,,, but you learn pretty quickly that when you want to pay for something or trade your DOGE,,,, people don't really want DOGE, they want BTC. That's why we're having this conversation on the Bitcoin sub rather than the DOGE sub. BTC is valuable, and moving BTC is valuable. The transaction cost only explicitly reflects Bitcoin's value.

You seem genuinely interested and the answers you're getting aren't really great (that I've read).
Think of it this way, look at the actual volume being exchanged today. Today, roughly $6B is the 24hr volume being exchanged. Now, this means that actual real people in the world have need of transacting $6B worth of BTC. It's important to measure it in fiat because as much as we'd all love BTC to be the standard, it is not. Fiat is the standard.
So, some people need to buy $40 worth of coffee, others need to fund their lightning node channel with $10 other and others want to go buy some other shitcoin and they want $100 worth of BTC to go use on the exchange to get their preferred shitcoin. At the end of the day, the person buying coffee with their BTC doesn't really care whether they're transacting 0.00003 BTC, or whether they're transacting 0.01 BTC or 17 BTC.
Since fiat is the standard all they're interested in is getting their USD worth of BTC transacted regardless of how much BTC it represents.
Right now, there are 1800 new BTC that come into existence every day in the pool of BTC that's circulating, so those additional 1800 that are created every day are added to circulation and get transacted to meet the $6B worth of demand. When that 1800 drops to 900 daily, *theoretically* (that word is of paramount importance) BTC value must increase to accommodate the "consistent" $6B worth of demand.
So today, at $6B, at current price, that means that roughly two million BTC are moving around on a day to day basis,  roughly .01% of BTC moving around is "supplied" by miner rewards being sold off / entering circulation (maximum). After the halving miners are only going to be able to provide half of that supply, so 0.005% of daily circulation. IMO this is pretty inconsequential in the near term.
However, in one year at 12.5 btc per block, we're looking at over half a million btc added to circulation. So projecting out a year from now assuming volume and price were the same as they are today, nearly 1/4 of the volume of BTC being transacted daily was ADDED to the pool of total BTC to go around. After the halving, and another year passing, assuming price and volume remain constant, now only 1/8 of the volume was added in the last year. So over the longer term this will make a substantial difference. Even if adoption remains the same, we will see a price increase due to supply shortage alone (assuming other things are held constant).
Everyone on this sub believes adoption will continue to rise, as will volume, and if that is indeed true then this effect is compounded linearly with adoption.

I have made purchases with BTC in the last 8 months. Mostly gift cards or [purse.io]( purchases, but I definitely spend where I can. It is just a hassle for one-off purchases. If it's coffee, utilities, petrol, etc that's stuff I can easily predict and budget for so those are the things I really want to be getting in the habit of purchasing with crypto.
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:22:18
Totally totally totally agree.
The exchange is a business and has autonomy and freedom. Wonderful.
What's bad is that coin-culture, the community, and the hashtag delist movement has created this stupid pressure that the exchanges interpret as opportunity to virtue signal.
Yes, it is the exchanges' prerogative to do what is best for them. No, we should not be creating a culture where they think it's best to delist coins because people start a hashtag campaign.

Any price change due to halvening is speculative rather than objective. The actual impact of halvening on the circulating supply takes a LONG time to accumulate to a genuine difference. We may see a run up, but I think that'd just be because we're expecting a run up.

Yours is the only top-level comment with any value to the Bitcoin community on this post. Thanks.
I agree with you. Thankfully, this is a primary use-case of crypto. The fact is, these content creators actually sell their content for real money. That money is likely going to be transacted in crypto rather than fiat, this is VERY good. That crypto is likely going to be BTC because it is the most accessible and trusted crypto, this is VERY good.
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:13:38
Yeah, I think I agree with you. When people are scared I feel like the go to what feels the most secure, and that isn't crypto.
Even for those of us in the crypto-sphere and actually believe in the long term longevity of BTC, knowing that mainstream does NOT believe in the longevity, at least for me this makes BTC a poor short term store of value because of exactly what you say. People will exit and in the short term prices fall and continue to fall.
Again, who knows. If we had some crypto-freeing legislation coupled with LN adoption by a big company or two we could see a boom before any wider-scale economic downturn. When BTC surpasses it's previous ATH I think that may be a trigger for everyday people to say, "Wait a minute, wasn't it a bubble at $20k? And didn't it pop? How could it be back at $20k are people really that stupid?" At that point it begins to look a lot less speculative and people might be a little more willing to trust it over other investments.

No way, I buy coffee anyway. I will go to the trouble of converting fiat to BTC just to spend it that day on coffee. Yes, I'll eat the cost of the conversion but that is worth it.
Kind of like a traditional bank that "helps you save" by rounding your purchases and transferring to a savings account I'd do it the same way, I'd say "I'm going to spend $30 (or $60 whatever it is) on coffee this month, so I'll buy 10% extra BTC to hodl and then actually spedn the rest!

I disagree with you because your definition of "inflationary" is predicated on the behavior of people. 
I do NOT disagree with your observations and I do NOT disagree with your predictions necessarily. What I DO disagree with is that human behavior defines whether a currency is "inflationary" or not. It's not useful to conflate the attributes of a currency with how people behave.
To me, your argument is akin to saying "The Bugatti Veyron is not fast because the average speed they're driven is 120kph". No, how fast people drive it is not a measure of the attribute of the owners, it's an attribute of the owners.


This is an interesting topic. There are so many factors. You have the people who believe the price is going to increase *at* the halvening, so those people are going to be stocking up, investing / gambling, immediately leading up to the halvening. So these people are going to be driving the price upward prior to the halvening. Those people are likely planning on taking profits when they realize gain so we might expect to see a dip when we peak at or around the halvening. Savvy people might anticipate this and get in early well before the halvening and take profits during the run-up to the halvening.
Then there is the ACTUAL economics of what's going on at the halvening. Here, I think I disagree with you a little and I'll explain why.
(1) BTC is measured in dollars still. I think this is inarguable. Within the community here and people who are interested in BTC sure there are people who want to be in the 21M club to own a full one, etc, but that is internal to the Bitcoin / crypto community. Any other BTC user is interested in what they can get with their BTC and what they can get is always measured in fiat.
My point here is that when people buy BTC, they're not signing onto an exchange and saying to themselves (generally), "I'm going to get 0.1BTC, I'm interested in 0.1BTC and uninterested in the cost in fiat."
No, exactly the opposite. Most people are saying "I am going to get $ fiat *worth* of BTC because I have some purpose for it." Mostly investment / gambling. Or funding a Lightning channel, or buying some other crypto, etc, but people internally are doin their maths in terms of fiat.
I may be wrong, but I don't think so on this point.
(2) So I look at fiat volumes and make the assertion that "People are getting $X fiat worth of value out of BTC" measured by the values reported by exchanges. This may not really be representative, but it's really the only measure we have to go by. So as BTC volumes in fiat increase, this is indicative to me that people are getting $X worth of utility out of the BTC infrastructure / currency.
(3) Finally, to the halvening. What this all means is that when the halvening occurs, the amount of new BTC being introduced to the circulation pool is half of what it was, so LESS additional BTC must accommodate the same $X worth of fiat utility the market is already utilizing. This means that the $X as it grows, over time is getting spread over less BTC than it has historically since the increase in circulating supply has reduced.
(4) So my prediction is an increase in price as this occurs. However, it is critical to realize that this doesn't have much of an impact right away. When you look at how much BTC is added every day in comparison with volume, it's basically nothing so this takes quite a long time to really start making an impact. Here I agree with you, that the price increase due to the halvening is actually long after the halvening, AND it is very gradual. (This is very good and sustainable. Fantastic design)
To me, the smart money accumulates now and takes profit during the run-up to the halvening. I believe that there WILL be a run-up prior to the halvening and that it will be a bubble that pops because lots and lots of people accumulated before hand, lots and lots of people are accumulating during the run up, and then lots and lots are going to take profits.
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:26:45
I feel like this can be bypassed with a full custodial provider. In the long term we have to have a way for people to control their own keys on LND without running a full node themselves. But until then, a reputable 3rd party could offer custodial services that you link your browser to your account with them and then it's all seamless. Yes, there is the inherent risk of utilizing a 3rd party but especially when you're only funding your account with &lt; $100 this risk would easily be worth it for your average user.
Especially if the custodian were partnered and trivial to set up. For instance, 
(1) download the plugin, part of installation has you 
(2) create a password that's used to spend / set up your account with the custodian and your browser can even provide its own auth internally so that that password only works with an auth'd browser so someone across the world can't guess your password and just use it.
(3) gives the user a qr / address that they can fund their custodial LND account with OR give them an option of funding with fiat via exchange
(4) good to go and you can re-fill at any time when your funds are getting low.
(5) Probably allow a way to recover funds, maybe seed words or something with some two-factor auth so that if your hdd crashes etc you don't lose your funds.
@_date: 2019-01-28 22:19:55
IMO this is a really good thing. The futures allowed normal investors to put BTC price in check. I am totally pro-BTC and am wholly sold that it is a WAY better solution than fiat. I also believe BTC is totally undervalued today and people will be kicking themselves down the road for not reading the writing on the wall in the old days (now).
BUT, the skyrocketing price of 2018 was not due to the objective reality that BTC is worth it, it was just a speculative bubble. Better it popped sooner rather than later, fewer got hurt, and now it can grow at a more realistic pace to reach the value based on objective reality and utility.

You don't know what you're talking about. New coins account for basically 1% of trade volume.
Currently, 216k BTC are generated in a 4 month period.
4 months from halvening, instead only **108k** BTC are generated.
That's a difference of 108k total BTC.
24 hour trade volume is $5.1 **Billion** 
108k BTC is equivalent to $378,000,000 USD. That's 7% of ONE DAY's worth of trading. This is basically inconsequential. It only matters in the very long term.

The possibilities are totally endless. I'd love to see an internet routing protocol built on top of crypto. Here's what I'm imagining.
You have hardware you've built or purchased (open source, kind of like raspberry pi where you could build your own but it's inexpensive to just get them from vendors)
That hardware consists of a computer which functions as your full node as well as your router, but traffic isn't over the normal internet (can be on top of normal internet, but ideally we'd phase out "normal" isp internet).
You fund your node's wallet and set up some consumer-grade radio equipment (like althea or skycoin type stuff), you connect to peers and start routing traffic. You can visit arbitrary websites, but there is a cost associated with that on this peer-to-peer network because you're paying other node-runners (like lightning network hops). Likewise, any traffic you route, you're getting micropayments for.
The routing protocol itself ought to probably be proof of work-secured, but if there were a mechanism for proving the traffic you've routed and your connectedness in the mesh, maybe that could also "mine" protocol coins to incentivize people to set up nodes and increase bandwidth and connectedness.
I'm dreaming, but gracious, it's totally possible.

They didn't lock every exchange. The sentiment transcends the circumstance of today.
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:56:19
Yes, 51% is possible.
The primary negative impact is reversed transactions. If you're selling coffee, 1 confirmation is probably ok, you're not worried about history being re-written and losing the $5. If you're selling a Lambo for $300k, you should probably have a policy of waiting maybe 12 transactions (likely overkill). If you're selling a country or something worth multi-millions maybe wait longer until you're sufficiently confident history won't be re-written.
So yes, a nation state could re-write history and reverse specific (or all) transactions, but the further back in history they're trying to write, the more expensive.
Even then, assume a nation state did build a super-miner, re-wrote history say reversed a day's worth of transactions and then continued to mine empty blocks. Yes, they could do this. But,, it's only a hiccup. Yes, public trust in the BTC and crypto-sphere is damaged,,, for a while, and yes BTC is unusable for a period... But,,, everyone still controls their private keys.
So all it takes is any change to the consensus algorithm, anything (like a POW change) that obsoletes the infrastructure the nation state put in place. The community would discuss it, there would probably be a handful of opposing solutions that would go live and survive (like BCH, BTG, LTC did). But we would recover, we'd pick up where we left off, maybe even pick up and keep the empty blocks from the rogue miner. And just keep going. Yes, it was disruptive, yes it was inefficient, but the market would fix it and put protections in place for next time.
Yes, we should be worried about this. Yes, we should be thinking of mitigations and protections NOW.
No, it would not break BTC, no, it wouldn't be the end of crypto. It would just be a big waste of tax payer money. Then again, it would encourage building a stronger BTC ecosystem,,, this is probably much LESS wasteful than most of what tax money goes to anyway... this gives me an idea., I**f I'm elected...**

Best option is to get it from a friend / relative. If anyone asked me to, I'd buy through a traditional exchange for them.

As for pricing, guesstimate:
Mining Hardware ($25B minimum) - the site you reference is just to get to 51% hashpower, it's not enough to wield that hashpower in a way to really devastate BTC in the way a state would want to. You'd need to re-write history AND sustain that attack AND you need to consider that by the time the hardware is in place, hash power of BTC has grown SUBSTANTIALLY, so that $8b is for today, not for 2 years out, which is how long it's going to take to get infrastructure in place
Mining hardware production ($12.5B) - this hardware can't come from normal sources, if they contract Bitmain or some other consumer producer, people would notice and defeat the attack, they could get some from these sources, but would have to either source small amounts from many producers, or produce on their own. Hard to say, but whether in house or accumulating over time, or contracting Samsung or Bitmain or someone to build a new generation 5nm miners or something, this easily doubles hardware cost, but let's assume it's only a 50% premium to actually get this hardware in place.
Energy hardware ($3b) - probably a big coal plant is the most cost effective, but you do need to build it, get coal to it, and get people in place conservatively let's estimate BTC is consuming 6GW today, assuming it's the same 2 years from now when the attack is going to take place, for \~51% we're looking at 3GW, at a cost of say $1500 per kW (source [ 
Not to mention personnel, administration, bureaucracy, etc,
But we all know thee state is always on time, under budget, and VERY efficient, so this total of say $35B might be able to be cut to $25B.
Likely already too expensive to be worth it.

"Wallet" is supposed to be something only you have access to, only you control. Some web-based services to offer what they call "wallet", but if you have to go to their website to send / receive,,, it's kind of "their" wallet not yours. What happens when their website goes down? Not totally safe, EVEN if they are being honest with you and you are the only one with authority to move the funds.
"Exchange" is more for trading. Either regular fiat money for crypto, or crypto for other crypto. You usually have a "balance" there and you can deposit / withdrawal, but shouldn't think of it as a "wallet", you can't easily or conveniently spend from it.
Some services offer both a wallet and an exchange, but it's much better to use a wallet for wallet's sake. There are a bunch of mobile and desktop wallets that are open source and can be vetted objectively that they're not stealing your money.

Day traders keep a lot on the exchange. Good day traders are taking profits off exchange regularly so theoretically they are making money that is being exchanged to fiat on a regular basis, so their risk exposure is limited to what they are trading with (which is likely substantial, but at least they've been taking profits).
Most people aren't day traders though. Most people are lazy hodlers that don't get their funds off the exchange.
