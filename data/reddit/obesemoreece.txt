You're right, nobody needs taxes, schools are funded by magic anyway.

They are anti-Russian, one of the first policies that they tried to pass was to remove Russian as the second language despite a third of their people using it as their first language. That is a pretty retarded move to make no matter what. The new government will not allow themselves to be swayed by the Russian government anymore and this is obvious.

What are you talking about? This is a policy that the new rebel government want, they aren't doing it as we speak because they can hardly be said to have a government.

Fuck off, the new government isn't exactly free of oppression itself. They're anti-Russian because of a fucking grudge.

Is the military specialised in killing brown kids? No, your country may spend far too much on its military but don't act like it's there to specifically kill children.

You're right, I dun did a goof.

Al Queda may not be what it once was but thinking that taking out the leader of it will destroy it is just naive.

Yes, literally all money goes to drones, idiot.

I'm starting to think you don't know what I mean. I'm pissed off because they're trying to remove a language that a bird of the population speaks as their first from it's position as second language, not the other way. They don't have he right to force Ukrainian on those people.

It's the only solution because your country would go apeshit if you sent men in to die while finding the terrorists. It's the most efficient way available that causes less public outcry.

*I'm so cool for not paying taxes to better the country!*
Fuck off.

I'm not talking about international recognition. I'm talking about how they can't remotely function right now. Do you also understand a thing about English? You aren't understanding anything I am saying until I say it at least twice.

If your dad thinks that they are still protesters then he's an idiot.
