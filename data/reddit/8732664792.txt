Again, collective brainwashing. It's like saying, "hey it's better, right! I feel better I know I do! I feel great! Isn't this great guys!" and hoping it's all true. I have read the craziest shit about superpowers and heightened awareness or whatever the fuck from nofappers as I have read anywhere else. If you can't just crank one out and go on about your day, not thinking about sex for hours on end and getting your life's goals accomplished, then I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you have an addiction, and even sorrier that it's something that nobody can really take away from you. 


Yeah for me, I can't say I feel a headache but I do feel strong urges. Instead of wrestling with stupid psychological bullshit all fucking day, I'd rather just take five or 10 minutes to deal with it and go on about my day productively as opposed to subjecting myself to some twisted masochism based on a completely natural instinct.

I never ever heard this argument in March/April. Nope. Not once.
I'm not disagreeing with you in the long term, but with a relatively fixed supply and incredibly variant demand which will likely approach some equilibrium over years to some, we're gonna have some overvaluation along the way. 
We've all seen that smooth technology adoption s-curve, but this technology is a bit different. It's not just some program, some website. You have to buy in. There are going to be more people who want to buy in at certain times than at other times. At those times, the cost of using the technology will be relatively "expensive". 
Your comparison to Twitter and Facebook aren't relevant because bitcoins aren't a stock, period. Stock involve actual company assets, actual growth or decline, actual cash reserves, actual services offered and supported, and real revenue produced. 
Do not conflate any of that with the value of bitcoin. 
That all being said, I'm really pleased to see the rebound from the $900 drop and this more recent one. If this is a period of overvaluation, it would seem we have a bit of a ways to go.

Who gives a shit if small restaurants and shops don't accept credit cards? Can they post a QR code on the wall? Do they have access to a computer with an internet connection? Then they can accept bitcoin. It's certainly a lot easier to accept than CC are. So, sounds like a perfect market for bitcoin to expand into!
No, it doesn't bring capital out. In your own words, "...bought it from...other foreign trading platform in the first place but sell domestically." So...transfering capital from a foreign entity to the domestic sphere? Sounds like, oh, I dunno, *exactly what the Party would want.*

So you'd say there was no housing bubble? Many homes are worth more now than they were before the bubble started.
If an asset is in a "bubble" honestly all that means is that it has recently been experiencing an increase in demand (and resultant distortion of price) that can't be traced to any fundamental aspect of the asset or its abilities.

This is needlessly complicated. Keep fiat in an exchange account. Want to pay with bitcoins? Buy bitcoins on the exchange, send them. In the scenario you described, there are no fewer steps.
Either you spend BTC and then buy some, or you buy some and then spend them. Asking to confirm the re-buy makes it no different than what you can do now. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:34:18
1. Find a vendor that accepts BTC for the product you want or a way to pay with BTC that your favorite business isn't involved with.
2. Call or email the owner/general manager of your favorite business and provide the info of their competitor's price and option for payment in BTC. "Hey, I've enjoyed your (product/services) in the past and I prefer to continue being your customer but I can only pay in bitcoins at the moment. Your competitor (company name) is offering something that will work for me, and they'll take my money (link to offer/explain on phone). I need to order very soon, and of course you'll have the money immediately. When will I be able to pay you in bitcoins?"
"Sorry, we don't accept bitcoins."
"Oh, well I'm so sorry too..I guess I'll have to buy from the other place, but thanks for your work in the past!"
**Do not ask if they accept bitcoins. Ask *when* you will be able to pay them with your bitcoins.**
Also, if you honestly want this business to change it's important to actually purchase from the competitor, even if the price is a little bit more (well, don't gouge yourself but you know what I mean). Nothing motivates someone more than realizing that what they're doing right now is actively shrinking their business. Considering that it really doesn't cost much of anything to start accepting BTC, a couplefew lost sales is enough incentive to take the couple hours for a business owner to read about it and set it up *especially* if their competitor's price is even slightly higher than their own. 
This is also why it's important to be completely polite and honest in the exchange -- you want to come off as a customer the business *wants* to have, and make it clear that you have no issues with the operation aside from the fact that you can't spend your money there.
Even if you can't find a BTC alternative, you can still contact the business. An unexpected phone call or email simply asking "When can I pay you with bitcoins?" could be the kind of thing that sticks with a manager of a small business on a ho-hum Wednesday.

Well I know, Mt. Gox is working with Coinlab now to bring the money into the US, but being as it's Mt. Gox and Coinlab they probably have the money necessary to comply.
I just meant for users of the currency as a whole, there are other exchanges where you can exchange USD&lt;--&gt;BTC that have nothing to do with the US and the only way to stop that would be to make wiring money internationally illegal. Furthermore, new competition in the exchange business will likely not be looking to open based in the US.

Also, I'd like to take a moment to correct you. You don't "lose" $100, because you never had it in the first place. Now, if you bought at $300, and it's now $200, you don't actually lose that $100 until the second you sell that coin.

Yes, imagine if instead of clicking an upvote, I paid someone for their comments. Now I have to pay to participate in the community. This sounds like a good idea to you?


Here's where your idea died. The entire lifeblood of an information website (news, articles, forums, social media) is basically two things, its user base and its ad revenue, with the latter feeding off the former. Unless its users are paying for access, that ad revenue is *needed*. Furthermore, you need a functional website with quality content, then you need to build a user base, *then* you start getting real ad money. Your plan requires a large amount of ad money up front to fund the distributions to users.  


Okay, so first it was going 100% to users, but now we're running raffles and lotteries? 


So you'll have a team of employees that review the countless submissions. How are you going to pay those employees?


If all of the money is ultimately coming from the advertisers, a growing user base would require that advertisers pay a proportionally larger and larger amount of money to continue advertising. From the start of the site, the pool of advertising revenue would have to constantly grow with the user base, otherwise old users would see less and less in payments as the user base grew faster than the ad revenues, which would lead to people leaving the site, user base shrinks, advertisers pull out.


What? The advertiser would pay for ad space on the weather site. The ad revenue would go towards the users of the weather site. I'm not sure how the company would be "helping to raffle off a vacation", I thought you said the site was doing the raffle/lottery.
The ad revenue of the front page alone wouldn't be nearly enough. Also, I don't know how the system would grow and feed itself, as you say. If, ultimately, the money all comes from the advertisers, each advertiser would have to pay a proportionately larger amount for each add with each user that is added. 


People do not need an incentive to post these things. Evidence: the whole internet right now. It would be a waste of money.


So...you're paying people to do something that they already do for free (go on blind dates with those who have like interests). Again, the whole point of paying someone money is to get them to do something they wouldn't do for free. If people will do something for free or even pay for it (congregate in groups online and seek out potential mates), why would you start a company to pay *them*? It just makes no sense to me.
I answered in detail because you seem very enthusiastic about the idea so I wanted to say something nicer than "don't quit your day job." You're describing a site that sounds like it would be fucking awesome to be a user of, but the business side of it doesn't pan out.

I read through the original white paper and thought, "Well this is pretty fuckin' brilliant." 
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:58:58
No...there will always be a price at which somebody is willing to sell.
It really is that simple. 
As long as the market is open, if the price isn't 0.00, someone is willing to sell.
If you're selling apples, and the last sale of apples was $100/unit, and there are no more units at any price due to a shortage...the price is still $100 per unit *as long as there are buyers with orders at that price*. Literally the only thing that can make the price go down is a lack of buyers willing to pay that price. It's simple, the price moves in the direction of buyers vs. sellers. If you have no sellers and still have buyers, the price will only stay the same or go up. I guess the buyers could decide to scare the holders and start selling for less. If someone had weight to throw around they could build a hill at a certain price and if sellers dried up cancel all the orders and cause a panic. But that's like...that's just fantasy talk. Let's be real: If something in this world *sells out*, that's not usually because it was overpriced or a bad purchase.
Why would everyone's number shift? Everyone knows that nobody knows what the final value will be. Most people get in with a target of what they would like to make, or double their money, and cash out their original investment and do whatever with the rest. That's like the most basic, layman hope of investing in something. Buy low, sell your investment high, and play with the rest hoping you make out all right in the end. As long as the bitcoin economy is still chugging along and people can spend their coins to buy shit, there's no reason to panic and sell at a plateau. Especially if you already made your investment back, you may as well leave it in BTC as they are much more likely to continue appreciating than fiat is.

I would agree with your sentiment that we would be surprised when it goes back to $5 merely because there's no reason to believe that it will. Considering that the last time it hit that price was well over a year ago, during which time the price has bubbled twice only to recover much higher than where the bubble started, and demand for bitcoins is basically as high as it has ever been and growing, can you explain why (beyond a technical failing of the protocol) you believe BTC/USD would ever be less than $5?
For the record, I believe this bubble started once we breached that first $50 wall. Looking at the charts, you can see we were on a strong but relatively linear/stable growth, but once it broke $50 all hell broke loose. 
I'll only be mildly shocked I guess if it sustains below $100, but I would literally bet all of the money I have that bitcoin doesn't sustain below $50 with the exception of a failure of the fundamental infrastructure/code itself or direct government intervention.
I personally define sustain as a VWAP of $x or less for a period of 2-4 weeks or more.

In that case you'd just cash it out and claim a capital loss.

Nobody knows what the equilibrium price will be. Even if it is $1MM, there will be significant peaks and valleys along the way. Basically, there's no guarantee *at all* that your BTC will be worth more *tomorrow* than *right now*, and there is only the *hope* that they will someday be worth significantly more than they are now.
Anyone who bought BTC above $200 knows *exactly fucking why* you'd want to spend your bitcoins. 
Let's assume BTC value is constantly rising and is a standard payment method/income denomination across the world. Why would I spend my BTC today? Oh, I dunno, because I need to eat, I need to get gas, I need to pay for water/trash/utilities/internet. I even need to buy my kids stupid plastic trinkets to play with, I need to buy my dog food, I need to pay for entertainment for myself...well I don't really *need* entertainment or stupid plastic trinkets for my kids, but I'm not going to forego them either. You know what I mean. 
Deflation doesn't discourage consumption, it discourages wasteful production. 
EDIT: And one of the big reasons that people hoard in the first place is because of the recent bubble/subsequent recovery (at least, so far). People aren't paid in bitcoins. They get a paycheck, they but 2 BTC. Next paycheck, BTC price is 25% higher, the same play money that they had before only buys 1.6 BTC. If the pace of long term bitcoin deflation levels out you'll see a much lower desire for the common buyer to hoard coins. Being as how bitcoin has deflated over 100% this year, *of course* people want to hold on to it right now. Just like if fiat was inflating at 100% per year, you'd want to get rid of it rather than hold it. Once the value is realized by the market, BTC deflation won't be so drastic. Would it still be smart to have some BTC stashed as a long term investment? Sure, maybe. But with any decent volatility, people would still get paid in fiat and convert to BTC when they were going to buy something in the next day/two/three/week depending on overall volatility. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:45:13
Yeah I'm really not understanding that either, came here to post this. If everyone hoarded, BDD would be virtually 0. 
BDD looks to have been on the rise since the beginning of the year, corresponding with the increase in price, user base, and economic activity. 
So...what are we talking about? If anything the data shows that people _were_ hoarding BTC.

@_date: 2013-04-04 19:02:26
It's actually the exact opposite. Trickle down is making policies whereby businesses and investors retain more profit/capital, spend it/reinvest to expand and hire more people, and those people then get paid, taking their new wages and spending them back into the economy. In short, supply-side economics. 
The rise in the price of bitcoins is having an effect whereby people have more money, spend it in the economy, and businesses end up with higher sales and demand, requiring them to expand and hire. In short, an increase in demand.

I dunno, I wouldn't really call 30 days and 6 months of transactions "limited data" especially considering that in the last 6 moths there's probably been about as much trading as there as been in the 1-2 years prior. This isn't to say that there aren't many uncertainties surrounding BTC, but are you saying that observation in trading trends over the last 30 days as well as 6 months is a fool's game and entirely worthless? I'm nowhere near betting my life, but it's not like we have much else to go off of. 
I don't say that I'm 100% certain, just that barring any crazy upsets, this seems to be the direction things are trading. With China's recent exposure, it'll be interesting to see how things develop!

I think you're taking things a bit personally.
People on this sub often give advice while primarily acting as an agent for the bitcoin market/economy. Of course, if you hold BTC (as many people here do), it is also in your personal interest to see the BTC economy succeed.
So, I'll go through your points to elucidate why people say these things:
1. Businesses giving a discount promotes adoption of bitcoin, which increases demand, increasing the price, and supporting the business and the BTC economy. 
2. It's wrong to assume that paying employees in BTC would lead to jail, though it would likely be a very complex operation (at least in the US) to do legitimately. In any case, it could be done, and would support the adoption of bitcoins. Honestly, unfeasible at this point.
3. This prevents a drop in the price of BTC. If you have 1k BTC, and you want to buy something worth 300, it is better to give those coins to a merchant who may or may not put them on the market (increasing supply) than to put them on the market yourself (definitely increasing supply). It's not so much as "instead of cashing out", it's more about making people aware that "Hey, this isn't just some investment, you can buy things with it too!" If you want to buy shit with your gains that you cannot buy with BTC, I don't think anyone here would take serious issue with that. But to incur a loss through trade/withdrawal fees and wait for your money to get back to your account is *seriously stupid* when you could just...go to the store/website, pay in BTC, and be done.
4. I don't really see anyone saying don't hoard. The general mantra is buy and hold lol. Speculation is good, over speculation is bad, most people see any speculation as the latter out of fear of collapse so they denigrate those who speculate and trade frequently. 
5. I've been reading this sub probably twice daily for many months and I have literally never read a post that says "Don't gamble your BTC!" Not to say that it didn't happen, but I can't see it as any strong sentiment worth making a post about. 
**TL;DR -- It has nothing to do with knowing better than anyone else, it is about shaping general perceptions and practices into something which will additionally support the bitcoin economy. If everybody did these things, adoption and support of bitcoins would grow organically and for more sustainable reasons than a media frenzy that focuses on its fiat exchange rate.**
EDIT: Huh, just saw this  but for what it's worth he isn't saying not to, he just took a position for the title. He clearly says he's not telling anyone what to do and gives his experience.

That's from the 3/18 ruling. You're obviously accepting the currency from one person and transmitting it to another person, and you're not doing it for the purpose of any good or service -- it's purely to get the currency to the other person.

Understandable, I didn't mean to make assumptions about your other assets, I think just the way you phrased it (wouldn't sell it even if you knew you were going to die) gave me the interpretation that you had a lot riding on it and didn't want to give up any possible gains at any cost, even your own quality of life.

Personally I believe it's just a combination of people getting more aware of DDOS attacks as well as continued market growth. 
Myself, selling crossed my mind a lot more when I heard about the lawsuit than when I noticed Gox was down. 
What would make people want to trade immediately after a ddos attack? There's no point in buying just because of DDOS unless people are selling, and there's no point in selling unless you're a panicky noob. While there are still a lot of panicky noobs out there, I think were approaching the point where the new people who get into it aren't as much of the market as they were. They're the growth, obviously, but the panicky new guy who sold his 4 BTC when the price dropped by $10 sold them to the guy who has been here since before the crash and is still sticking around. 
If you look at the recent downslide from $120+ you can see...the time around where it bounced from 100 was the time with the most volume.
I posted that chart a couple days ago. I wouldn't discount another price shock to $80 or $75 quite yet. But considering the continued growth of the user base and barring any huge upsets within the community/infrastructure/exchanges I think we're at or nearing the bottom of a future increase in value, however, I don't think it will be nearly as meteoric as the recent bubble for quite a while.

I can imagine it. I actually imagined this earlier when reading another bitcoin article, don't remember which, but I thought, "Well, only a matter of time before someone creates an inflationary cryptocurrency." and then thought bitcoin would be the natural store of value in such a regime. 
But, that would also require an inflationary cryptocurrency to take off, and that part went beyond my imagination. Can't see why anyone would trust who has inflationary controls (Assume there are and and it's not a standard x%/year), and given that bitcoins already exist with their crypto advantage it's hard to see why anyone wouldn't just use fiat if they wanted inflationary money and BTC in the cases they desired the function of crypto.

2. Given the history of the last month and all the data that one can look at we can expect continued growth at least in the short term. Is it a bubble? Who knows. But the price suddenly crashing in the next couple weeks (and by suddenly crash I mean like a sustained loss of 40-50%+) would be the result of something nobody can predict. Gox hack, government ban, or just a few big holders selling all at once. Things like that.

I kept it simple: troughs. peaks. go. 
I don't see your logic to $150. It looks like you drew a circle around 150, pulled a line back somewhere roughly in the middle of the peaks/troughs after the crash, then threw some volume circles and stars and some other stuff, I dunno. 
You say your logic is sound but you go well above the peaks in your upper bound and only remotely hit two of them, ignoring the lower ones. You also didn't circle the lower volume from 4/19-4/22.

Pseudosymous what Bitcoin is. Since every transaction ever is tracked, you can see what coins come/go from where. If your address is known, (say, you operate as a writer under your real name and take bitcoins on your website), you're no longer anonymous. 
Bitcoin isn't anonymous by default, it's a pseudonymous protocol which people can use anonymously with a bit of foresight.

Can you point me to some documentation or explain this? Let's say you're in the business of growing a rare shrub. If you grow 100 shrubs, you don't pay taxes on their value once they're eligible to be sold. You pay taxes on the dollars you received for their sale. 
If you're breeding pigs, do you pay taxes on the value of the pigs at their time of birth, or do you pay taxes on the amount of money you received for their sale?
Makes no sense to me that a miner would have to pay taxes on the value of their BTC at the time of mining. Makes complete sense that they would pay regular income taxes on any gains realized through an exchange.

MtGox had an account in the US seized this year which I believe had a couple million in it and have been in an ongoing SNAFU to fix their compliance with US regulations. Their domestic (Japanese) bank also has imposed some limits on international wires.
Their SEPA transfers (transfers between banks within the Eurozone) are working fine from what I've read. Couple/few days and you have the money. For EUR they have a bank based in Poland (if I remember correctly), so they only need to fund that account and then can transfer EUR from there.

I actually think that they *want* their citizens to own and use bitcoins. As capital from around the world (including china) is poured into the bitcoin market, it represents a transfer of wealth to anyone holding bitcoins. What if we did hit $10k per coin in a couple years, and now thousands of Chinese citizens are holding even 250 bits? (.25 BTC) Do you know how much $2500 is to the average Chinese citizen?

Early this morning the price was around $245-250. I awoke and checked the price about 8:30 am US central time. Maybe an hour or two prior it had peaked at 266 and dropped to $240 or $230...it was a decent drop. It recovered though to like $250-255 I think, and then the selloff started between 10:00-noon, can't remember.
I was extremery close to cashing out half as I felt a drop was coming. Last time I felt a drop though and sold, the drop started but a surprise buy wall appeared and I fucked myself, so I stopped trading after that. Too many people with way more money than me, time to just hold on.

No, Bitcoin is a commodity with a fixed, increasing but roughly logarithmic supply curve. Humans generally flock to networks and services in exponential numbers before leveling off.

Just because someone or a lot of people think something, doesn't make it true (see: Bernake saying he doesn't "agree with the premise" of a downturn in housing because housing prices historically never dropped significantly, spoken at the peak of the bubble in 2005)
Point being, a lot of us believe it, but the bottom line is that we can all agree BTC will either be worth a fucking shit-ton in 5 years or it will be worth basically nothing. Based on all odds, history, and our understanding of the protocol, we're pretty sure it's the former.

I would need to know the details on the insurance policy and security procedures before making a decision. 
To be honest, I can't imagine how much you have to pay to get an insurance company to guarantee coins. What if the price spikes by 1000% inside of a month or two, and the service is hacked? Gee insurance company, looks like this thing I was insuring spiked 10x in value, then I lost 500 of them! I'll need $5,000,000 please! 
Then what, go dump $5,000,000 into the BTC market, effectively driving up the price and paying more for them than they were when lost? Even as a dark pool/off book order, that shit is gonna drive the price at least a bit. 
Effectively, as long as this volatility remains you have to have an insurance policy that was always significantly greater than the actual amount being insured. If BTC went up in value, the service would cost more and more to insure (and thus, use). 
I've tried to think about it a lot, but the only way a bitcoin bank would work is if the bank made its BTC capital and amount of customer deposits public. E.G. "Hello world, please look at our public address(es) and see that we have starting funds of 50,000BTC. These will always remain in the address shown, except when pulled for deposit insurance. We will accept and insure deposits up to 40,000 coins." 
So that's how you get off the ground, but then what? What happens when the BTC economy grows, and your current customers want to deposit more than you can back? To keep growing as a bank, you'd have to not only turn enough profit to make it worthwhile, but have enough revenue to continue to back your depositors 1:1 even through insurance claims that you have to pay out. 
I just have a hard time imagining a business model that works until the value of BTC doesn't vary by more than 20% or so within a year. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:00:55
I agree with your strategy (keep coins local, keep small amount of fiat on an exchange to replace spent coins), but FYI it does nothing to mitigate your tax liability. Granted, with what you've described I doubt the IRS is going to come after you if you're just buying new little toys and what not, but if you bought a coin for $500, then 5 months later spent that one coin to buy a $1500 computer, you *do* owe tax on that $1000 gain. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 01:03:31
If you wanted to be safe and not have all of your coin profits fall under income tax, you could just wait till you've mined X amount of coin, sell it on the market at a price, and then buy the same amount of bitcoins for the same price. Then you'd tax the gains from there.
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:31:13
Well nobody is saying put all your money in coins. It's best, while we transition from fiat to digital currency, to have a supply of both and never leave yourself with only one way to pay. Then you can use whichever is most advantageous given the market. 
It's really not hard. You bought coins and now they're worth more? Spend them, or hold them. You bought coins and now they're worth less? Wait a day, week, or month, you'll likely come close to whole again. Historically, you will become whole again, it's just a matter of time. 
If you want to use bitcoins as a payment method but are afraid of volatility, put a couple hundred bucks on an exchange, and when you're going to buy something, buy the coins, send the payment. 
It's not hard to use bitcoin as a payment system while both the seller and buyer are insulated from price shifts. You just have to think a little bit.

I've never been formally educated in anything like this, I'm just noting what my brain tells me is a pattern. It likes to say that about things though. Yeah, I didn't pull the down slope of the 6mo chart from the 266 peak, I realized that later. Looks like the intersection would be a little lower, $80-$85 or so.
In any case, these aren't calculated averages or anything obviously. Like I said, this is just what I see when I look at the longer term charts. I'm relatively comfortable with where things are at right now. Whatever the price is tomorrow, it seems that we're on the ups overall. 
Grats to anyone who bought around $80!

What you've read has not taught you anything about Bitcoin. It is not backed by nothing, it is a cryptographic (essentially, mathematical) way of communication involving an electronic network (the fucking internet). What it communicates is the control and possession of value, basically like any other currency does. It's actually a bit different than the reserve notes in your pocket. Think of it like this. You have a $20 in your pocket. That's not actually $20. It's a promise and guarantee that it can be *redeemed* for "$20" of value. This is backed by a government. You have bitcoins in a locally stored Armory wallet with a paper backup. You have complete control of these coins. They cannot be counterfeit. They cannot be used without your permission (unless you have been insecure). They are not backed by a government, but math itself. This transcends borders, languages, and policies. 
The current volatility in value will continue, but every time you see those spikes in value, remember that for the most it's a small but growing bunch of people who walk around talking to people saying, "Holy shit, this is amazing, it seems like a whole new way of doing things."

You owe tax when you take the profits of an investment. Holding the coin leaves you with no tax liability. Selling it does (capital gains).

If you want your favorite businesses to accept bitcoin, here's how you do that:
1. Find a vendor that sells the product you want or a way to pay with BTC that your favorite business isn't involved with.
2. Email or call your favorite business and provide the info of their competitor, say "Hey, I've enjoyed your products/etc. in the past and want to continue to be your customer but I can only pay in bitcoins at the moment. I need to order the product very soon, and you'll have the money immediately. When will I be able to pay you in bitcoins?"
"We won't accept bitcoins."
*(if you're feeling smug)*"Oh, okay so I'll just buy from the other place from now on, thanks!"
Do not ask if they accept bitcoins. Ask when you will be able to pay them with your bitcoins. 
Also, it's important to actually purchase from the other guy. Nothing motivates someone more than realizing what they're doing right now is actively shrinking their business.

I don't think he's referring to overproduction in scope of the *market*, but rather *human need*. In an inflationary economy, the incentive is to spend even when you might not actually need something, because everything becomes worth more (nominally) over time anyway. This fostering of demand beyond normal needs and wants creates the overproduction pyalot is referring to. 
Again, it's not that overproduction is any kind of actor or impetus, or that the production is always outpacing demand in an inflationary economy, but that artificially increased demand results in artificially increased production.

A lot of the fees that you mention are paid for by the buyer. You can ask for bitcoins for your property, but the services for inspection and title work for the buy side are ultimately up to the buyer's discretion. Escrow service wouldn't be necessary as anyone who buys your place isn't using a fix-up type of mortgage to buy your place (or any mortgage for that matter).
Also, the buyer *never* pays his agent's commission. Realtors split the commission originally negotiated when the listing agreement was signed.

If you're looking to claim it as taxes, there's no reason that it'd be confiscated. If you went and made a $50k deposit at the bank they'd ask "Where did you get all of this money?" and you would say "I sold bitcoins locally for cash." Obviously you have record of what you paid for the coins, so $50k-whatever you paid initially = profit to be taxed at short term capital gains tax rates (assuming you held for less than a year). 
There's nothing wrong with selling high value items for cash, despite the way the fiat system might often make you feel. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:39:29
Well you're not taxed every day. It's not hard to consider your taxes on bitcoin.
Main issues: 
Are you holding anything worth more than $10k USD in an account that isn't in the US? (So basically are you using any service besides Coinbase or CampBX?) If so, you should probably report foreign holdings. If you've just been buying a few hundred $$ worth of BTC every couple weeks and transferring it to your local wallet, you don't need to report the accounts. 
From there, it's just a matter of when you bought and sold. You could have bought a million BTC when they were $0.01. For as long as you *own* those million coins, you owe $0 in taxes. The second you exchange the coins for either more USD than you bought them for or an item of value worth more than you paid for the coins, you owe taxes on the difference between the value of the coins at purchase and the value of the item/dollars purchased with them. 
I believe bartering income (which is what it is when you have or have had access to a commodity at a lower price than the current market price and trade that commodity for a new toy) is based on your maximum marginal tax rate. Short term is the same. If you put $5000 into BTC at $200 and cash out at $600 4 weeks later, your gains are $10k, taxed at your highest marginal tax rate. For the lowest tax burden, you're going to want to hold your BTC for at least 12 months and cash them out. Long term capital gains are 0, 15%, or 20%.
I'd have to double check that last part regarding barter income vs. long term cap. gains, but the above is a rough, rough summary of what my CPA told me back in April.

I can see the argument, but at the same time I never considered the miner as an employee of anyone receiving any payment. If anything, miners are like subcontractors, not employees. I thought of it as a miner mines these bitcoins (kind of commodity viewpoint) and then sells them on the market. His business is himself, his costs are electricity/equipment/space/etc, and his revenues are his exchange sales with BTC either from tx fees or block reward/pool reward. If BTC were rising then, you'd pay business taxes on the exchange revenue, and immediately buy back the BTC so that if you wanted to hold and sell for more years later, you'd pay CG tax on the gains (as opposed to income tax).
I've never mined, I just figured that's the most legit way for a miner to do taxes and not get screwed.

Uhhhh...actually you have it wrong. Without people *buying* it the price can't go up. Everyone's got their number...there will always be someone willing to sell.
I think you're making a quick assumption in saying that people's faith in BTC is based on the idea that it will continue to go up.
My faith in BTC is based on the idea of the protocol and how it can change the way humans deal with money. If bitcoin goes up to $2000 and stabilizes for a month...then I would hold on to my bitcoins and spend them  as needed. Why would I see something that rapidly increased in value and then plateaued at 80 or 90% of its peak? That seems like a pretty stable, useful currency, and such stability would only make people more comfortable using it. 
Also it's not like everyone is tuned into their PCs ready to send all their BTC to their favored exchange to liquidate at a moment's notice. Furthermore, you're saying


which jumps to the conclusion that *not having insane growth* is a bad thing. Insane growth is fun, and it's what happens when thousands of people suddenly enter a market as we're witnessing before our eyes, but it's not inherently a good thing. It's very scary, and for bitcoins to be used as a currency we need to *slow down* the growth by a good bit.
Of course, that's impossible. The market wants what it wants.
But to say that "Oh well once the growth stops everyone is going to bail." No they won't, by the time that the bitcoin market and price stop growing, a whole payment infrastructure will be in place, and they'll just spend their coins. Exchanges would do well to make their clients aware of that in every way possible. Of course, they wouldn't, they want the clients to cash out so they can get the fees. But if they were idealistic at all and interested in the long term growth and stability of bitcoins, they'd have info about where and what you can spend your coins on when you went to trade/withdraw.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:39:03
Wait how an I am outlier? Because I spent a bit of coin? Considering BitPay had an extraordinary day on Black Friday, when bitcoin was near all time highs, I don't think I'm nearly as much of an outlier as you paint me to be. 
My advice to "live a little" isn't beside the point at all. If this is the first BTC price rally you've been through, you'll see what I mean later. I don't know if we're going to get to 1500 or 5000, but the rate of growth we've seen in the last 6 weeks isn't likely to last forever, and nobody should regret spending near all time highs of a recent price rally to buy goods and services that they genuinely want/need.
That being said, I'm someone who bought some coins a few months back and has made a nice profit. If I had claimed my stake at $800, then yeah, I wouldn't be doing a god damn thing with BTC for like 12 months. 
It's a cycle of new investors waiting for their profit point, and old investors spending a fraction of their coin. But this overall idea that nobody wants to spend BTC because it could be worth 5% more tomorrow or 1000% more in 2 years is ridiculous. Anyone who says that hasn't lived through a period where you're panic-holding BTC, watching it slowly drop 5-10% w/w.

Good vibes, man. 


I totally agree -- any bank or business has their targeted profit, and are always trying to beat that profit. Whether you're trading dollars or clamshells, money that isn't yours isn't free. 
One interesting thing I just considered though is that, depending on the rate of deflation and the object in question, the consumer has the option of waiting until they have enough purchasing power to buy what they want. This isn't an option *at all* in an inflationary economy. I don't think it would be impactful in the mortgage market because of the tx amounts relative to a normal person's income, but for smaller things like recreational vehicles, cars, your kids student loans, etc I can see how a bit of simple planning+saving over the years would allow someone to still have these things without needing to incur debt (or at least, as *much* debt) to get them. 
I'm just really interested to see how it works. I still have some comments I haven't responded to in that thread. I was kind of drunk and sort of mis-spoke. Many hardcore BTC advocates (of which I would call myself one, but definitely not quite to the extent of many others) decry inflation like the plague. Many who dismiss and laugh at BTC decry deflation like the plague. I get frustrated with the absolutes.
It will be very interesting to see modern inflationary western economies become enmeshed with a deflationary by nature, almost impossible to counterfeit, highly fungible, and optionally anonymous "currodity". Curious and odd indeed. Both groups act as if one system will win in the end. Full stop. Winner take all.
I believe like most things in life, the truth is ultimately *somewhere* in the middle. Given where the price has been just based on speculation, and my own knowledge of the protocol, I don't think a $5xxx valuation in due time is wholly impossible. $10k+ is mighty questionable, but still believable. When I see people throwing out $50k or $100k+, that's a bit laughable to me. 
That all being said, I wouldn't mind being wrong. ;-)

Not on topic but you should probably read the definition of fiat currency before you keep making yourself look like a fool.

I dunno, with the world of bitcoin already so vast and unknown to newcomers, I think having concrete terms like "mining" which have a clear meaning (even if the process isn't clear initially) helps people who read about it. 
The last thing we need is for things to be unduly verbose.

Yeah it looks like you're just drawing lines on shit though and adding smiley faces and circles to be cheeky. EDIT: And stars on peaks which you don't coordinate with your line at all.
I roughly connected the troughs since the bubble started with the peaks since it burst, and the approximate result is movement towards what seems like $80-100. Any thoughts on that?

So, what have we learned?
1a. Don't trust all of your money with an exchange.
**1b. Don't fucking trust all of your goddamn money with a single exchange/wallet.**
2 .Don't invest your life savings "and then some" like a fucking idiot (unless you have a deathwish/fuck it all anyway outlook, then rock on).

Uhhhh what? Any thoughts you can verbalize for me?

To be fair, most banks don't give a shit what the actual interest rate is because they just end up in an MBS pool anyway, I mean portfolio loans aren't a big business for most banks (I mean, not as big as MBS origination). 
That being said, BTC will obviously never be the currency in which any mortgage is denominated. Nations will still have their currencies, we'll still live in basically inflationary economies, but BTC will be a seriously important commodity whose ease of transfer and fungibility will allow it to act effectively as an international currency. 
I can see a point where governments *might* accept BTC for tax payments (I mean the US accepted hemp at one point, it's not like using commodities for taxes is wholly unprecedented, though it mostly is in modern times), but yeah nobody's getting their salary in BTC unless they set it up themselves or work in the BTC industry.
I think that hardcore 100% BTC advocates overstate the impact the technology will have, but they make some pretty bold claims. I think its impact will fall short of those claims while still being very, very significant on the world stage.

There was a guy who posted a bitcointax.info (or something like that, I don't remember), some kind of site with tax info regarding bitcoin, you might want to search for that.
In my own discussion with my CPA, barring any explicit instruction from the IRS regarding digital currencies it is likely that bitcoins would be considered a commodity. Going off of memory, the IRS defines forex specifically as trading the currency of another nation, so bitcoins don't fit the definition. It best fits IRS code as any other good or property, and then trading such for a good or service is considered bartering income.
From a quick google search though, it looks like I might have been wrong. Bartering income is just income, apparently there's more details regarding whether it's normal personal income, capital gains, etc. that I can't be fucked with to research right now, sorry.
This was all from last April, I just brought it up because I knew we'd need to have a discussion and that was the brief rundown I was given. Consult your tax pro. Blah blah blah.

Because it's a secure (the protocol, people can certainly have insecure practices if they haven't read for a couple of hours to really know what they're doing), private/pseudo-anonymous asset that is impossible to counterfeit, and has a limited supply yet is infinitely fungible for all intents and purposes. 
This isn't to say that the recent price decline won't continue, but the qualities of bitcoin do allow for it to be used both as a currency and as a store of value (the latter mainly due to its restricted supply and it being impossible to counterfeit). 
If you look at the history of bitcoin it has fullfilled the role of holding value very well over time (which is generally what you're looking at if you want to store wealth, you're not looking at 3-6 months from now, you're looking at 2-5+ years. Literally anybody who put any amount into bitcoin before about 6 weeks ago and simply held their coins has seen their value held quite nicely, and perhaps then some. Only time will reveal the ultimate truth of bitcoin's feasibility and value, but the fact that it's something completely new, never been done before with no central authority yet it has performed like it has over the last 3 years is nothing to scoff at.

The success of ddos depends on panic. 
There are a lot of new people who are very prone to panic. 
After you watch the charts for 3-6 weeks, you grow some skin and stop giving such a shit about the price. 
Or you can't manage your anxiety and you bail. 
This will continue to happen until those who buy/sell and are familiar with the swings outnumber those who start fucking crying because they invested in something they knew nothing about and lost gains they never realized (or lost money they shouldn't have been investing in a highly volatile market). 
But yeah, sell all your coins. We'll see a more stable price in a few years, you can always come back.

Eh? If you're sending money, you're already in your account, it takes literally 10 seconds to subsequently place a buy order for the amount of BTC you just paid. 
I don't mean to rag on the idea, it's just that I'd call it an extremely minor improvement over my current scenario. Instead of confirming an order that took me 5-10 seconds to make, I confirm an order that was generated automatically. 
Maybe it was the title of the thread that threw me off from the start. It'd be a nice option and I wouldn't mind the major exchanges implementing it. But to say that this is what we need in order for Bitcoin to survive is laughable.

I'm glad that I called bitcoin a bubb— oh wait nope I never did that when talking to you. I hold bitcoins!
Though, bitcoin *was* in a bubble, and clarifying that was my only point in even engaging you. Just because something starts at X and ends up at X+100 doesn't mean that you can't have a bubble in between those two points. 
Again, saying something is a bubble doesn't mean it can't end up better than it started.
This asset is priced at an unsustainable value.
This asset has increased in value at an unsustainable rate.
This asset is in a bubble.
If either of the first two statements are true, then so is the third. All of those statements were true of Bitcoin on April 10th, because obviously neither the price nor the rate of price increase ended up being sustainable.
If I woke up tomorrow and Bitcoin was worth $1000, I would *absofuckinglutely* call it a bubble waiting to pop. If it shows sustainable growth from the current price to $1000 over the next several months/years and that growth is supported by things like blockchain analysis/widespread merchant acceptance/etc, then I wouldn't call it a bubble.
Is there a reason you're so contentious?

Bitcoin is taking hold regardless of what the US Government decides to do. You can foster innovation and truly be a part of a big shift in the financial system, or you can regulate it right into the arms of foreign markets and more accepting governments.
