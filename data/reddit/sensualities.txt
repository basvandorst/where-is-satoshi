I honestly wouldn't buy in bitcoin right now.
The key with investing is to buy low sell high. 
As much of everyone loves bitcoin, I think we can all agree that if you are looking at making money, right now isn't really the time to invest in bitcoin my friend. Waters are quite sharky right now

Vitalik really doesn't care what happens with bitcoin, if all I think he would like to see it succeed. 
He doesn't care about being better than bitcoin, he cares about being the best ethereum. 
You're literally starting to sound a little crazy, maybe you should go outside and enjoy the day

Here is the thing. The market cap of Bitcoin will not go up very much if hardly at all any time soon. Based upon the current civil war within this community, at the very least the price and value of bitcoin will stagnate. Saying that bitcoin can not be replaced simply because it was here first, does not give any logical explanation to why it will be the most valuable. Darwinism, evolution, every factor known to man has proven that the stronger and more superior will replace the others. Am I saying bitcoin is weak? No. Am I saying there is better tech out there? Of course. So saying that bitcoin being replaced would indicate the fall of cryptocurrency, that's a bit extreme bud. Because in life, everything that was once good, will be replaced by something that is now great.

You are one of the many reasons bitcoin is becoming slower and slower and increasing in arguments across the board, losing market cap, the whole nine yards. Ignore it all you want, but assuming "oh once some other coin creates something useful" that you can just steal it and put it on the bitcoin blockchain and it works that simple is very simple minded and immature.

Tell me this. What upgrades has BTC implemented recently?
What new technology has happened with BTC?
What businesses have started adopting BTC?
What major banks are working with BTC?
I'm not knocking bitcoin, I hope bitcoin will fix it's shit, but until then, it's either adapt, or die. 
People are calling ETH a shitcoin. Do that all you want. But ETH is increasing twice as fast if not more than bitcoin is. 
People said "the flippening" was nonsense. 
Now those same people have invented the word "Un-flippening". 
Like I said. I want BTC and ETH to succeed. But believing that only one coin is going to rule the entire crypto world is a maximalist mentality, and life doesn't work like that.

ETH scales faster than BTC, it is cheaper than BTC to send, ETH is more profitable to mine, it has more trading volume, it has more utility, ETH has a better protocol layer and an actual roadmap on which they can agree on something. The SEC can't "investigate" ethereum because they don't even legally see ethereum as a federal security like a stock. 
If you want to actually talk technological specifications, ETH wins every single time. 
So do what you want, but until bitcoin can actually agree on something, you and everyone else in here is going to be rationalizing how "this is good for bitcoin"
