How does the verification of the file work? The second party generates the same hash from the file, then imports the wallet using the private key?
This is just extremely interesting to me, I'd like to try it with an image as an experiment. I'm not even sure how to import a private key though!

Oh shit... I assumed this was about the all-time high (clicked without reading/thinking) so wasn't surprised about the doom and gloom predicting death.
Then realised it was about a 90% drop from about $30... man, this was around the time I first heard about BTC and thought it was some kind of scam.

Right, I misunderstood a couple of things. 
So I've gone through the process you described and sent a satoshi to the address. I checked a block explorer and see no transactions, so I guess I'll have to wait for the transaction to be confirmed.
Now I'm assuming anyone who I send the image can generate the hash, retrieve the bitcoin address and then check the date of the 1 Satoshi transaction... am I on the right track?

@_date: 2017-01-11 04:01:01
Well, there's the historical significance. The fact that it influenced so much art even to this day... this makes it desirable for collectors who are fans of art and history. That's where most of the value lies. Someone who buys it as an investment simply understands that there are people who are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of owning it.
If you own, you could hang in a gallery and make people pay to come see it. That way it would earn something for you indefinitely. This also makes it a valuable asset.
Having said all that, a lot of modern art is fucking terrible, has no significance artistically, historically or otherwise yet is hideously overvalued. I personally think that a Van Gogh should be very valuable, but nowhere near the value people are buying them for these days. 
My degree in Fine Arts, however, has no intrinsic value to speak of.

Wait... it has a CPU which can run at up to 29Mhz??? That's amazing.
Also useful to know that it's rated to store data for 30 years, I'll make sure to transfer the BTC before then!
@_date: 2016-12-24 16:26:13
Works great, uptime has been 100% so far in my experience. Intuitive to use, works well, it's very cool to see your BTC being earned in real-time, even if it is very small amounts.
Most of the time when I've shared images from Supload, it was received just fine. I just shared the content I would always put out anyways (gaming-related, retro gaming too). Good content, interesting, not spammy at all. The image was simply hosted on Supload.
But in one instance I had a very negative reaction. People in the thread considered it a "shady" website simply because they checked out the site and saw that it said "earn bitcoin!". It caused so much negative attention that I deleted the thread, despite the fact we were having a great discussion otherwise.
So even though I really enjoyed using the site and interacting with the developers, I won't be using it further unless the public perception changes.

Fiat money is not based on anything physical either. Paper money represents what the bank owes you, and what the bank owes you are numbers in a database. 
Cash is an agreement between people that it's worth something. So is bitcoin, but it isn't created out of thin air by institutions.

Would some kind of tutorial or education video be useful? Is there something about bitcoin that people generally don't get which needs to be explained? I don't consider myself an expert on bitcoin but with help to gather the right info I could make a decent video.
@_date: 2016-12-16 07:24:58
So they get a short text/email explaining how to deposit into their wallet?

I think that was definitely a part of the problem.

Yeah, I'm conflicted about it. Not really saving a lot of money by waiting for the dips I guess.

@_date: 2016-12-30 06:19:34
Not much - you need a LOT of views to make money via ads on the internet. Still, Supload pays more than Youtube.
Personally I've made $0.56 with 1516 views. That's pretty good.

The "repair" function should fix it. Find it in the options somewhere, icon looks like a little medical kit.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:24:59
I'm 110% in support of Supload, which is why I'm drawing attention to what I think is the greatest hurdle for it. Also I'm trying to start the discussion in a place which is very positive towards it. More likely for people to come up with solutions :)
I brought up the Youtube comparison, they weren't buying it. I eventually convinced one person that it might not be so bad after all, but he still made the point that the perception is what counts, regardless of what the reality is. He's right.
Someone just replied saying that Bitcoin also has a bad reputation among a lot of people as a kind of ponzi scheme. That might be part of it too.
Despite all this, I managed to start another couple of threads which were received very well. One got 81 upvotes.
I think that the more people use it and the more visible it becomes, the more trusted it will be.
@_date: 2016-12-30 06:16:32
I said pretty much everything you suggested. Here are a couple of their replies:




I made a comparison to Youtube, they said this:




I said "Yet many users monetise even though they make practically nothing."
He said:




Most people view it that way. That's why you were told it was a shady website.


To be more specific: You might not have had any ill intent: But it's the perception of it. People perceive it to be a cash grab and a shady website.

I don't use bitcoin for anything else apart from saving. Feels great to use it on Steam, and I'm willing to lose a couple of bucks for that. It's not like I buy games every day, this is just an occasional purchase.

Bitcoin is not controlled by an authority. It is not deemed to have value by a government. There are a few benefits to this such as transferring between borders and unlimited amounts without friction or interference. Apart from this sort of thing it's inferior on a daily basis. If this changes and crypto becomes more accessible, there will be no reason to use Fiat unless you're forced to by an authority at gunpoint.

Bitcoin has always been associated with Silk Road, drug dealers, scammers, Wikileaks and who knows what else.
Now a public figure (Jordan Petersen) has decided to use Bitcoin as a tool to avoid censorship by organisations and goverment, and as a method of protest, and many of us are pissed off because we disagree with his **opinions**?
Come on. This is a legitimate use case that Bitcoin can do well RIGHT NOW. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. If you support free speech, don't call for the censorship of people you disagree with. If you're concerned about the image of Bitcoin, you're being ridiculous.
