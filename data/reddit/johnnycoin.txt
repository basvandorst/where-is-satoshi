I made a post under that linked article that the link in the article seemed to be a scam... sorry  you didn't see that. How did i notice, because I got scammed in an identical situation in January. So you are not alone. I lucked out in January because my transaction queued long enough that it got dropped. I still have no idea how this could have happened that I got my coins back, but I did.

He had coins stolen almost from the first day, I actually believe some coins were stolen while Jed was still in charge. There is comprehensive address history documented for all of this.

I don't support BCash or any alt, however, I call it like it is and this block size and scaling issue has been a complete disaster in every way imaginable. Organizations do things for myriads of reasons, being right is just one of them. Sometimes you do things that are not necessarily the best decision in the long run to make it to the future decisions in the strongest position possible. Core, you suck at strategy and decision making. There is simply no other way to describe what is going on right now with txn wait times, it has been a strategic failure of the worst kind.

Bitcoins are created as a reward to a computer owner (aka miner, in this case both the computer and the owner are often referred to as "miners"), when their computer has earned the right to create a new block (set of journal entries) into the Bitcoin blockchain (one giant ledger). This happens when a mining computer solves a cryptographic math problem before any other mining computer  connected to the internet AND then also wins the race to broadcast its victory across the planet and ALL copies of the blockchain. 
The winning mining computer runs software that every mining machine in the world runs, they all play the same game and are running the exact same race. This software itself is created in such a way that the software determines how many new bitcoins a miner receives when they have won the race. They cannot hack or change this reward without being caught and everyone on the internet would reject their proposed victory block. 
The software is designed to cut the "reward" in half every few years. This continues until a very specific point in time when only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created. 
The reward started at 50 and is currently at 25, it will drop to 12.5 in the latter part of next year. The rules for reward dropping are very clear and known to every bitcoin miner.

Coinbase is hated on reddit because we are in the dark ages of Bitcoin and the community is made of up anarchist and Libertarian extremists. Coinbase plays by the rules rather than breaks them, so the community vitriol will never end until the community itself changes.

Miners don't believe the price is going down, they only want more coins, they only sell coins to pay expenses that require fiat. They are not looking for a high price to mine, they are looking for flat difficulty, and maximum coin yield. BTC difficulty was flat, miners pumped their cash into next gen chips which are hitting the network as fast as they can get them out there. 
These miners are already committed to mining for their careers and have already spent the money long ago, nothing will drive speed to market faster than a coming split in production..... would love to listen in on those logistical issues....

What makes you think this, do you suppose that profits for miners is too low to have the capital coming from them? 
I think we vastly underestimate the profitability of creating chips and using them for mining on low cost power grids. If you know what you are doing, you are conjuring up capital out of thin air.

A hardware wallet IS access to your coins. Keeping a Trezor tucked away in your bedroom behind the shaving cream is your suggestion for safely securing your thousands in Bitcoin? Maybe you would suggest the safe in your house? 
And what about that little nasty recovery seed? Where might you put that? Maybe that belongs in your safe deposit box. 
Better make sure your Mom reads the fine print and doesn't forget her PIN, or where she put her recovery seed. 
Trezor doesn't seem to be too worried about people screwing things up according to some of their instructions... of course i am joking.... enjoy their guidance....
@_date: 2015-12-18 23:09:00
Well it changes dramatically if you are leasing a fab and have designed and printed the chips yourself. Consumer mining is a joke because no manufacturer is selling to you for anything less than maximum possible profit that they could possibly get mining themselves. You are only left with tiny marginal amounts and only if bitcoin price exceeds whatever the mining company has chosen as their multiplication factor. You are screwed as a consumer period, unless the price spikes 100% right after you buy. Screwed.
Intel spends $25 per chip for new fabrication. Bitcoin is vastly simpler in design and setup costs, size of chips is small compared to a Intel CPU, so higher yield per silicone wafer. I would guess that bitcoin chips cost less than $5 per chip. Would love to see some real numbers on this though
Bitcoin is probably a perfect use case for cutting edge silicone fabrication: simple chip design, easy to scale down in size, Print them by the millions, add boards and low cost power and start recouping your investment almost immediately.... there is no selling necessary, only mining and you are into revenue. 
Yes it takes you millions to start but in 9 months you are printing money.....better have that power source available though....

another quote:
" the amount of Bitcoin (last I heard about $40 million in USD terms) was still very small compared to many other collectible markets, much less the amount of currency in circulation from the central banks of even tiny governments. Bitcoin certainly has major downside risks but it also has far more upside potential than other collectibles. So obviously it's an extremely risky investment at this point in time. Nobody should be doing anything remotely close to what I read this morning from some twitterer (presumably it was just prevaricating puffery) and putting "all [his] money" into it."
you could be identically skeptical today.... at 7 billion..... wow if only
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:02:38
yes, of course everyone knows how serious I am about keeping my bitcoins keys next to my shaving cream. But you have highlighted yet again another reason for a bank. 
Other than you trusting another institutions security you are basically just exposed to the weakest point of entry into your own home baked private key protection system. 
Where do you keep your keys, paper, hardware, backups, safe, off sight, safe deposit box... the list is seemingly endless. 
Bitcoin needs banks and deposit insurance and when they are everywhere bitcoin will start to the primary store of value that it was intended.

You can't involve another person in the long term, as they may die. You cannot use technology as your plans can be foiled be future unknowns. 
I recommend the following solution that would probably take you a couple of weeks to complete:
1. Create a paper wallet private key and do not take a picture of it. Cut the private key into three pieces. Do not make any copies
2. Ask three friends to help.
3. Have each friend create three copies of each private key value along with its private key order and write it on a piece of paper immediately. 
4. Have each friend put the private key value and its order in a regular old plastic bottle like a 5 hour energy bottle. 
5. Have each friend create a scavenger hunt for all private key values, and write down the instructions on paper. 
6. Take the instruction papers and put it in a safe deposit box. 
Why this would work:
1. There are three copies of each key value, significantly reducing the risk of losing key values. 
2. No single person, except you originally had the whole key. 
3. It is a pain in the butt to do scavenger hunts, you won't even start until your stash makes it worth your while.
4. If you do lose some of the keys you will still be able to unlock your wallet because you likely will only lose a couple in the worst case scenario.
5. You will video the whole experience and potentially make public your scavenger hunt as a national television series, making more money on the television show scavenger hunt than you would finding your own stash of coins.

Bitcoin has a natural basement always, it is the value of all real world transactions. Anything above that value is a bubble and will either go up due to speculative greed or go down because it is a bubble. We are above the real world transaction level right now.

3. I have bought bitcoins every time i feel the price is right and my wallet has cash. I have purchased a number of items online with Bitcoin, but primarily hold them in speculation.
4. Bitcoin will not go away, it has a limited supply, it will be around in 10 years and be more valuable than it is today, will it be worth $1k again, i don't know, but I think the risk is low that it will be worthless, too many people own bitcoin now. 
I do think there is a chance that in 10 years a similar currency will be more dominant than bitcoin. Momentum swings quickly in technology.

I really like your post. Fortunately for me, I only lost 4 BTC in Gox. I feel for the many, many that just just had their family's college funds, and mortgages disappear. 
It is events like these that make people cling to government and regulation. I won't be one of those people. 
I trust a regulator far less than a free market. I trust a politician far less than my neighbor. 
I look forward to the rebound, however, i think Bitcoin won't recover for a year. People will need to forget about what happened. It is gonna take time.

A person to person exchange would never be subjected to this, as your address can always be confirmed as normal. This is just an exploit to defraud exchanges out of money. A transaction actually posts to the blockchain but Gox software is written in such a way that it can be fooled that the transaction hasn't happened. So if you are clever, you get Gox to pay you, you change the transaction so it is invisible to Gox, then you ask Gox to pay you again. Because they are stupid, they pay you again. 
Gox has the worst PR people EVER. They are arrogant and prideful and their answer to this problem is to blame Bitcoin???? wow
@_date: 2014-10-01 01:29:34
This is foolish and naive thinking. Having a system taxed at 3% so that bankers can make millions so you can fund fraud with higher prices and then you believing it is a good thing is the greatest con ever. 
Also, the notion i am happy that I don't have to pay taxes on 3% in fees is a foolish and completely unintelligent incentive. That is like saying you are better off making nothing, because you save on taxes!  Please give me the 3% and I will gladly pay taxes on that rather than reduce my income 3%.

I think Bitcoin goes on a 4 week streak ahead of the etf decision. Then either way there will be a pullback, if it is approved maybe just 10-20%, if no ETF is approved then 50%. I think we are at $2k in 3.5 weeks, then I am anticipating no approval so back down to $1000 give or take $100.

Because the impact of an ETF will change everything... and there is no bound to human greed and speculation.

Well first realize that something like Bitcoin comes around very infrequently. Bitcoin is not Dell or Apple or GM or even the US Dollar. All of those require good planning and execution to be worth anything in 100 years. Bitcoin does not. Bitcoin simply must exist and its distributed nature means that it likely will. 
So you are sitting on the cusp of history, in 10 years it will still be here. In 20, in 30. You have the chance to buy some speculatively in the first five years of existence and your pride, your historical bias, your comfort in the known is keeping you from doing it. 
Now if you are already independently wealthy and don't need any more security or diversity, then by all means sit on the side line and throw food. However, even then you may not want to have to look back in 5 years and realize just how much lack of vision you really had. 
So reason  you will likely never have an opportunity like this in your lifetime

Not investing more than you are comfortable losing is the biggest joke philosophy of all time. It is the battle cry of the middle class. 
Every single one of us can afford to go all in, no exceptions. Bankruptcy is temporary, so many millionaires went bankrupt more than once in their lives it isn't funny. 
If you don't fully regret going all in at 32, you will will someday. The thing that will make you have more regret than that??? Not going all in the third time around!! 
Believe me there will be a time when Bitcoin never comes back to the average person. It will rise and rise and rise, and with it will go the lost hope of the average guy getting in early on the currency of the next generation.
Bitcoin has risen dramatically with only geeks, freaks, and thiefs buying in. What is going to happen when all your neighbors want to buy a coin or two? What will be even worse is when some new adopters you know go all in and move out of your neighborhood next year. They will probably pay cash for that house you have been dreaming of building. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:45:53
You would only be bankrupt if your speculative Bitcoin plan required you cash out in 12 months. 
Going all in is a subjective decision yes, whatever your criteria for ROI and exit strategy or long term holder, you get to make the call, and yes you should be willing to face the worst before you make that decision. 
The point is that you shouldn't be convinced by the FUDsters, you should weigh the evidence, determine your best strategy and do it. 
Going all in for me is not a bet that i will be a millionaire in 1 year or even 5 or 10. I am putting my discretionary investment money into bitcoin long term. I will continue to do so until I think it has truly been tanked by government intervention, which is the only way I see it ever dying. 
All in all i agree with your post though.

It seems there are other ways to improve the odds. Like eliminating any attempts at impossibly unlikely addresses.... I think testing every combination is not the right strategy.

one of my favorite reads
even in parallel you need millions upon millions of computers, the numbers necessary to even find a key for ANY of the existing addresses is mind blowing
I will say that these numbers will be dramatically different in 20 years. Bitcoin will have to evolve to keep the laws of computer power at bay
As for entering and claiming the coins on an address, you simply import your private key into any Bitcoin wallet, if it works you will know, your balance will say 25,000 coins!!!!

Wow, you either don't do a lot of shopping or you spend way to much time on your hobby finding btc retailers. I have the completely opposite experience with my circle of bitcoin friends. If a retailer takes bitcoin great I will use it, but I am not seeking them out. From time to time it is after I pay that I see their bitcoin sign (dang), but this has only happened once or twice. 
The secondary market is even worse. I challenge you to call 100 craigslist ads and ask if they will accept bitcoin without explaining it to them (meaning selling them on it). If you are above 2%, I will be shocked. 
Bitcoin's value is secondarily about day to day commerce. That is just reality.

Completely disagree, this is of course a bitcoin problem. Why? because you don't see the same thing happening to ATM machines.... you don't have atm owners being held hostage "or else"
so you have to ask why this is a problem with Bitcoin and not ATMs... because right now bitcoin capitalists are the fringe of society and law enforcement doesn't really know how to deal with the whole subject. 
This is also a primary problem with paying bitcoin in large sums of money to people you don't know for things like cars, tractors, or gold. Let's say you agree to buy 10k in gold from someone, maybe you meet in a public place, it really doesn't matter. Then when you show up the guy across from the table slips you a note that says pay 10 BTC to this address or you won't make it home.... same basic scenario.... bitcoin sucks for transactions.... and it sucks being too publicly accessible (ATMS)... need another 50 years.

Let's say you can buy BTC for $1250 on BTC-E and you somehow have $1250 in US dollars on BTC-E to buy it, but the going rate is $1280 on other exchanges like BitStamp. 
You would buy it for $1250 on BTC-e, pay their fee whatever that is, withdraw your BTC to your wallet, not sure if they have a withdrawal fee. Deposit your BTC into some other exchange and sell it for $1280, less fee on new exchange. Assuming you could do this quickly then you would have made $30 minus your fees on both exchanges. 
The value of your BTC is only determined when you sell it. You can look at various exchange prices only to get an idea of how much your btc is worth if you chose to sell it. However, you always need to take into account fees, costs associated with trading, and the risk you take (time, stuck txns, screwing up) while you move your funds from one exchange to another.

Mining centralization is a disease, but we don't have that yet. The problem bitcoin is facing right now arose because miners rejected segwit, pure and simple. Rejecting a change is not indicative of centralization, it is indicative of bad PR, bad policy, bad politics. If we had one miner with more than 50% hashrate then maybe we would talk about centralization.

Well I agree that it will continue to go up for another 10 years probably. However, I think it is terrible for transacting with anything other than on exchanges. You simply have too many variables to worry about. Losing your coins, losing your wallet, paying out of a wallet that exposes your balance to bad people that then steal from you when you go to buy something from them, txns fees, wait times, et cetera. I think those things will get better but not much, for me Bitcoin is a unique digital asset class, but other coins will be used in day to day commerce, not Bitcoin. My opinion. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:26:08
I think this is the smart play here. If it miraculously gets approved buy back in. I am currently holding long and have been for a long time, however, it has crossed my mind to sit this one out. I also wish the bitcoin unlimited crisis will move out of the way as well. There are 5 alt coins just sitting in the wings waiting for bitcoin to screw up. The strangest things about moments like these is that looking back on today five years from now it will seem like we should be smart enough right now to know exactly what to do... but yet the reality is that I am not.

MS Word is just one example of the Gorilla marketing phenomenon. You don't have to be the best if you are the biggest. There are hundreds of similar marketing examples where one product simply becomes the dominant player in that space regardless of what the competition has to offer: ebay, amazon, facebook..... you are fighting history if you think for some reason this software is going to be different. At best you can hope for one or two other crypto currencies that remain viable at all whatsover. In a perfect world Bitcoin implodes due to infighting and miraculously another coin takes over, I think it is unlikely.

The mistake is assuming that more miners would have made different demands, because with the current inputs to the decision 10 miners would make the same demands as 1000, nobody goes against their own interests, unless you are a nun or priest. 
The irony in ALL of this is that miners would almost certainly have voted for SEGWIT if fees were still low, but now they don't want to give up those high fees. Keeping txns speeds slow to justify LN ends up being a horrific strategy, just horrible. In the greatest irony of all the only path forward for Core is to increase the block size, eliminate the near-term profit incentive for miners, then get a vote on Segwit..... that is the only path forward for Core at this point.... we are all spectators to a completely obvious coming chain of events.

@_date: 2017-03-05 01:58:38
exchanges will trade higher as long as there is friction between exchanges, meaning that you cannot easily deposit Yuan on chinese exchanges buy BTC, then sell on Dollar exchanges. The process of depositing Yuan and buying on OKCoin is too slow or too expensive. If there is complete fluidity between markets then the price would always be very close to the same or people would easily arbitrage. That is not to say that arbitrage doesn't still happen but it is more difficult. I tried to arbitrage using a chinese exchange once, I think I made like $5 on $5k arbitrage, so I didn't try again.

I seriously don't understand this point of view about RBF's seemingly mysterious usefulness. It is almost like everyone in here hasn't used bitcoin before. 
1. Almost ALL of the average bitcoiner's transactions are NOT with retailers. I am typing at my computer entering in payments into my wallet. Copying and pasting keys around. 
2. I double check, triple check, every amount and address to make sure I don't make a mistake, and I still make mistakes!
3. RBF would help me recover from those mistakes!!!
WTF people, I love it. It isn't like a confirmed txn can be replaced... just one that hasn't been confirmed yet. 
And retailers can easily request no RBF txns in their QR codes, and in the case a non-RBF retailer has an idiot customer that pays with an RBF txn they can consider an RBF payment incomplete without confirmations.

and still three years from the next halving.... what have we done
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:39:28
bitcoin is created when people use computers to solve a processing problem (miners), there is essentially a race every 5-10 minutes to solve the problem first. The first to solve the problem gets two rewards: 
The first reward is that they can collect all fees that are associated with any bitcoin change of ownership that are waiting to be written to the distributed ledger. These txn fees are not paid with new bitcoins, just fractions of bitcoins that already exist.
The second reward is a specific number of newly minted bitcoin that the miner gets to keep and sell or hold. This second reward is cut in half every few years. You can go [here]( for the countdown clock. 
Cutting the reward in half essentially reduces by half the coins that enter the market for trading hands. Reducing the new incoming supply of coins dramatically is typically anticipated before the halving but the general expectation is that the price will rice significantly as a result. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:20:21
Any attack on Bitcoin is a built in aspect of the "gaming" side of Bitcoin. Computers do not care about "fair" or "ethical". What is going on now is completely fair as far as the protocol is concerned. It not incumbent on actors to play fairly it is incumbent on the core team to protect Bitcoin in small ways that reduce the opportunities bad actors have to negatively influence the Bitcoin economy. 
Pure and simple the only way to avoid this problem is if Core steps in and makes changes, the most obvious one is to up the block size. People need to stop looking at this as extortion, they need to look at this as exposing a design aspect of bitcoin that can be gamed in a way that has a detrimental impact on the bitcoin ecosystem. Upping the blocksize is the best way to remove this attack vector.

What you are missing is the toxicity of the last three years. Regardless what you think of big blocks vs small blocks, Core could have conceded something, anything at all and bitcoin wouldn't have missed a beat. However, because Core refused to concede anything, absolutely nothing, they have created and fed enmity between core and a huge block of the crypto community. 
Bitcoin in the span of two years has gone from an amazing brand that had a halo effect from a benevolent creator to one that symbolizes totalitarianism. 
Frankly, the technical details in the blocksize arguments are largely irrelevant, what is ultimately left behind is the marketing message that you and your opponents have crated and Bitcoin Core has destroyed their image. I don't think bitcoin is dead, but the door is wide open for the competition and Bitcoin Core with one decision could have crushed EVERYONE. Instead they chose to fall on their swords self-perceived strategic supremacy and technical bullshit.

I no longer proactively discuss bitcoin with anyone because the reaction i have found to be more than simple disinterest. In general once I am a "bitcoiner" my colleagues trust me less and confide in me less. I am a cult member that they do not want to be a part of. 
Fundamentally, I think the problem is that to value Bitcoin also means you must devalue your existing world. The notion that banks and fiat are backed by nothing and that anything about their financial palace they created being an illusion is more than most of my colleagues can bear. 
I have a lot of successful friends who have made fortunes following the rules placed before them, Bitcoin breaks those rules.

I am not a fan of having 800 alt coins, but in 10 years there will still be hundreds that have survived the frontier of crypto. Because Bitcoin can be used to do everything the alts do, doesn't mean it will or will be easy. Development takes time. A focused dev team can create utility for an alt at far greater benefit to them than building on top of bitcoin, so the trend will continue forever. There will be losers, lots of them, but there will be winners....lots and lots of winners.

Very few comments on this article...., tells me r/bitcoin is dying..... here is the deal, core has played this block size game terribly, if sidechains are the solution they are the solution at 1MB, 2MB, 10MB, preventing a size increase simply exposes Core for who they are..... There is no need to use fear to prevent ANY size increase because it makes no sense. EVERYONE that has a brain knows that simply changing to 2MB isn't going to change a dang thing. LET the block size increase, if there are issues they will start to percolate, use them to push people to sidechains..... preventing ANY size increase is going to cost Core control.... in the end this is a terrible game to be playing.... someone on core please use some common sense and simply increase to 2MB asap.

Gaming assets are a huge future trend for Crypto. I am only shocked this has taken 8 years to finally happen for Bitcoin. This game is not a seemless integration into Crypto, but I think it will be soon enough. The SnapChat generation is never going to install a bitcoin wallet, but they sure as hell will be happy to trade you a game asset and exchange that for real dollars. This is, in my view the gateway use case for the younger and less technical crowd. 
@_date: 2016-02-04 13:33:59
You have to make huge assumptions and resort to hyperbolic claims of heroic coding to cling to the notion that bitcoin would have failed with a 2MB limit. You of course know that bitcoin would not have failed with 2MB instead of 1MB. Suggesting that there would have been ANY impact that anyone would have noticed outside of the devs and some late nights of coding is FUD pure and simple. 
The whole of bitcoin stood on the shoulders of Satoshi that day as he randomly entered 1MB instead of 2 on his keyboard..... that evening the fate of bitcoin was in his hands, he thought for a second about 2 but went with 1.... and from there, bitcoin's future was assured... let us create "1MB day", the day of his commit, and let us call that day holy. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:30:59
This is just a speculative justification for switching. Who says Bitcoin ever has to have high volume of transactions for miners to be millionaires. You are in a terrible sales position telling someone that is going to make a million dollars this month, that they might make more if they just give up their profits for a year or two.

However, the link between blockchain cards and in game assets is not seemless at all right now. Requires having counterparty wallet, connecting your account to the counterparty address, et cetera. Also, while the game recognizes your counterparty assets, you cannot currently move your in-game assets into your counterparty wallet, AT ALL. These are obviously on their to-do list, but they decided getting the game live was more important, which I frankly agree with.

Unfortunately Litecoin has a tiny fraction in fees for miners compared to bitcoin, so while the argument that Bitcoin moving past its current drama would be beneficial, any parallels with Litecoin economics are completely stupid. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:43:45
The point is that the block size could have been incremented by just a little to avoid the fee increase (core chose to do nothing while a scaling solution languished), to buy enough time to release segwit. Not an odd way to look at it, but i would say the most obvious. This is a problem of terrible strategy plain and simple. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:49:47
your post is just terrible useless excuse and you dang well know it.... 2 MB could/should have happened two years ago plain and simple

@_date: 2016-02-04 12:58:47
All of our opinions are subject to being manipulated including your own. I would argue it is far more likely that those inside of an organization have their opinions controlled far more than those on the outside.
I try and keep my opinions very neutral and to simplify arguments. What I say about LN and block size is completely true, bumping the size even a little right now risks nothing for bitcoin or LN in terms of technical viability. The notion a bump to 2 MB puts anything at risk right now is of course a lie. It is the same as saying that Bitcoin would have failed to get as far as it has if Satoshi had mistakenly chosen a 2 MB limit rather than 1 MB when he reduced the size years ago. This silly notion is opinion manipulation of the highest order and complete nonsense. 
The only reason Core has chosen to not consider a bump right now is because of the precedent it will set, you know it and everyone that has a brain knows it. The truth is that technology does move forward including China's bandwidth. All of the negatives that core brings up about block size do indeed have substance at some intersection of a myriad events IN THE FUTURE (bandwidth, storage, latency). That time is NOT today. 
To suggest that Bitcoin would be centralized or less successful today if Satoshi had mistakenly chosen 2 MB instead of 1 MB is the sales pitch that nobody will ever buy. Once the block size is increased to deal with txn volume, there is the risk that it may take years before we ever move away from that solution.... and years to therefore evolve the ecosystem to LN, which is really what core fears the most. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:27:22
Conservatism is just a farce to buy time. Sidechains aren't ready, once they increase the limit once, they know they will never have leverage to stop it again, this is their one shot at making their lightning network work and we all sit on the sidelines simply pretending that their "issues" have any substance at all. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:45:24
Hmmm or maybe they could have simply eeked up the block size just a bit to buy some time... that would have been too easy. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 10:37:07
An S9 is $1200 on the bitmain site. So your payback will be shorter. I believe Bitmain offers discounts for buying a few, you would have to call them. 
1. Can you get a facility that has that much power load to run 15 miners? These things are very loud as well. 
2. Payback if price increases faster than difficulty 
3. Are you borrowing the money to pay for the miners?
If you are not borrowing and can sit on your coins for two years, then I think buying 15 miners is probably a better investment than buying 15 bitcoins. But that is my opinion. 
Edit: oh and you need fast internet

@_date: 2017-10-13 04:12:11
Not necessarily. It will likely take several more ETFs to bring the price in line. In fact the closing price is $680 so not as big of a premium as we have seen in the past. For traditional investors GBTC and future ETFs like it are the only reasonable and logical decision, holding their own BTC is just not an option for 90% of the public. 
ETFs will likely enjoy a premium until there are enough to dilute the demand, which could be a whole heck of a lot in the coming months. 
There is an argument that ETFs will always have a premium because they will always be the only easy way to diversify your 401k so the cost of capital is completely different than people that are spending their savings. I will pay a premium because I am in a longer term investment almost always and I am not paying the same taxes as if I were investing with my savings. 
I of course hold GBTC and it has been insane for my 401k. I am curious what the price will do with this current surge, it went past $1000 at the top of the last surge. Tomorrow is Friday, so likely some type of gap up tomorrow, but probably not too much because you have a risky weekend hold during a bull run. If price continues the pump through to Monday, then open price of GBTC on Monday will be impossible to predict.

Actually, no you don't make sense. GBTC has never traded less than BTC except for maybe an hour or two that I know about. They also don't issue more shares unless they acquire more BTC, so no idea what you are talking about. It is designed to be an ETF pegged to BTC value, so if you want 401k BTC exposure it is the only game in town.

most people shouldn't possess real bitcoin of any significant amount, this is just a fact. People that actually have $100k to invest in assets simply should not be buying real bitcoin with it and learning to manage and protect it. ETFs will be the way that 99% of all big money will own exposure to bitcoin. The masses of true-wealth people do not do stuff like learn which wallet to use and how to protect their treasures, they hire other people to do it for them and an ETF will be far and away their outsourcing of choice.

Only by haters because it has traded at a premium for so long. It does have high fees, so the ETF creators are surely raking it in.

My very well connected friend from Shanghai says that there is a rumor in China that a few very very big chinese officials/businessmen/oligarchs are currently playing a very dangerous/fascinating game buying bitcoin. Speculation is that there is government influence in purchasing a majority of all bitcoins in the next five years to hedge against global Bitcoin adoption. Apparently, the government is behind some of the mining operations in China actually funding them and providing free power, and some Chinese officials think that it is smart to act now while the rest of the world is sleeping on this sea change in finance.

step 1: government as quickly and quietly as possible spends 50% of their Treasury on Bitcoin, buying in savvy ways to keep the price in check as long as possible. 
step 1 concurrent: government commits to mining and distributed network maintenance and technology, creating a platform for education and private sector growth for years to come. (not to mention innovations in energy production)
step 1 concurrent: government adopts bitcoin as valid currency of exchange for all commerce
step 2: bitcoin spikes so much as a result of concurrent steps 1 that all other governments will struggle to match holdings of the first government, thereby creating a position of bitcoin dominance in a small heretofore irrelevant nation
step 3: small government becomes currency 2.0 leader of the planet and reaps the rewards of innovation and efficiencies that money 2.0 will bring to a nation (accountability, transparency, less curruption, et cetera)
step 4: someone steals all of the countries coins and the entire administration chews a cyanide pill.
Well it was a good idea.....

As much as the fed, the accounting office, Bernake and your government would like you to believe in this asset and liability swap nonsense, it is still nonsense and the US has printed new dollars. The US bought their own bonds! and it wasn't with monopoly money. The banks have that money in their accounts, they have massive excess reserves today that they can spend at any time. THE ONLY reason they have not spent that money is not because it is fake money but because the government is paying them above market interest rates to hold the reserve and not spend it!! It is all a complete scam of epic [proportions]( Make no mistake about it the money is there it is sitting in billions as reserve balances on the bank balance sheet. The government is gaming the system simply by paying outrageous interest rates on these deposits. They buy their own debt with a huge cash payment and the promise of paying eternal returns if you don't spend that cash payment! well guess what... those interest payments are getting spent, those interest payments are also printing more money. QE is a clever way to buy some time, but the money supply is massively larger, it is printing money no matter what government propaganda or colluding economists would like us all to believe.

You are looking at it the wrong way. If the percentage of world energy consumed by bitcoin becomes too large, humans will move to destroy Bitcoin. The relative cost of Bitcoin cannot threaten humanity......
This is not simply an accounting exercise. Eventually, the relative cost CAN become too big and the Bitcoin network as a whole will be rejected by humanity. 
Cheap energy IS essential to Bitcoin not because of Bitcoin accounting but because of human accounting.

Cheap energy IS necessary. Cheap is not so simply defined as the fiat cost out of miner's pocket for that energy.... For example, in 50 years the world will not allow Bitcoin mining if that mining consumes 60% of the world's power.

I don't agree with this sentiment. There were lots of precursors to Bitcoin that failed for small reasons. Any one of those people could have been Satoshi. Satoshi simply took from those ideas and added a gaming component.

I am not sure Occam's Razor kills any conspiracy theory. 
Occam's razor only prefers simpler theories over more complex ones. There are so many variables in play with this story that a simple theory doesn't match the facts, which only leaves you with more complex theories as options. 
I don't think Wright is Satoshi, but I feel he probably has access/knowledge regarding the million bitcoin .dat file..... keys are another story.

Sorry this is a completely ridiculous point of view, there is no guilt associated with transactions rewards, you pay what is necessary to clear your transaction in the time you want nothing more. Computers and algorithms don't have feelings, holy hell. If the network demands a higher fee then it will cost a higher fee to clear your transaction, if the network doesn't need fees or needs minimal fees then it will cost next to nothing. The day Bitcoin needs charitable uses to continue operating is the day Bitcoin ceases to exist. I can only hope that you are trolling and not serious.

I have done research and have concluded that indeed you are a troll and have no idea what you are talking about. While Ross deserves to be in jail for some period of time, his sentencing is beyond a doubt a miscarriage of justice and that you cannot admit this means you have no integrity or are being paid to broadcast your misinformation, which is the same thing as not having any integrity.

Some government leader is going to have an epiphany and it could come at any time.

They have in their bitcoin address (ledger account) the possession of the balance of bitcoin digits that were previously in your address (ledger account). Since ledger accounts in bitcoin's shared ledger are locked by an encrypted private key, you are screwed unless you can get the thief's key to steal them back.

1. Wright convinced Gavin he is Satoshi, which had nothing to do with the digital signature. So Wright in my view must minimally have access to Satoshi digital assets (emails, communications, documents, probably wallet).
2. Wright has not spent any early coins to date. He doesn't have the keys. He is not Satoshi. 
3. Wright continues to double down on vague promises. Wright expects to have the keys, has a plan to get the keys. Is trying to leverage what he does have and hope to pull it all out of his ass in some strange game of chess. 
There is a real Satoshi story here. Wright is involved. My guess is that he has the wallet.dat with 1 million bitcoins, however, he is NOT Satoshi. He bought the super computer to crack the wallet.dat BIP32 pass phrase and is patiently waiting for the crack. He probably has done the math and expects the crack soon, which is why he is ramping up the BULLSHIT. 
Wright is NOT Satoshi, but he does have Satoshi's wallet. Stay tuned.

Greed without bounds is no different than any other human failing. Greed creates Kings, it creates theft, corruption, collusion and every back stabbing business dealing that has ever existed. Sure you can count on greed, but you can also count on murder. It is NOT the basic human trait upon which all humanity pivots and it never should be.
You are conflating sustainable profit with greed, they are not the same nor does one create the other, in fact greed never guides a human to sustainable profits, greed will only take you to unsustainable profit, always and forever. Truth.

You seem to be too offended to trust. You also clearly have biased yourself with the elevated tone you use comparing SN to CW. 
Bitcoin itself, its design is a well documented mess. Bitcoin architecture is a mess, a mash up. Brilliance like a Pollock is brilliant. Bitcoin the architecture looks much more like a CW than a Szabo, which is probably why Bitcoin beat Szabo to market. Ethereum looks like Szabo, not Bitcoin. Truth.

Try and ignore the fact you have it, diversify a little, but just try and wait another 4 years before you cash out of your bitcoin stash.

Monopolistic profits are almost always amoral, feel free to argue otherwise. Example, price gouging during natural disasters because you are the only water supplier. This is the most extreme, but crony capitalism where people lobby for laws that protect their profit margin are the most common. 
Greed cannot be the ultimate guiding hand for your economy or you will have nothing but corruption.
