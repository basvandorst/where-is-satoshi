So let me get this straight. The county police are engaging your wife in a discussion of crypto currency and Blockchain analysis?

Tip: any finance expert who pretends their advice is any better than a monkey throwing darts at a dartboard is, well a finance expert.

Yes, I know several people who mortgaged their homes to but stock in things like altavista.com or home grocer.com.
While not homeless, they now live in shitty one bedroom apartments

Pssst. Secret. 
There are many people well beyond the confines of reddit who will lead you to believe they have special powers/advice that can help you beat the marketplace...if they were able to do so, why would they be hanging around trying to help you
Equities, real estate, currency and bond trading are a complete crap shoot with the odds stacked against you..crypto currency ain't no different than gold or oil or baseball cards. Really. Before you consider yourself a wise investor spend a couple of months studying the transactional history of comic books. If you don't, your a fool...
I'm not joking. And I'm trying to help :)

Why would a finance expert be encouraging someone to speculate on currency?
Oh, wait, nevermind. Hey, Im just glad I can find a way to make an honest living..

Valued money isn't necessarily a bad thing...it has value, no?

I'm missing something here.
I can see the passion and ideological interest in BC, but that shouldn't be the basis of an investment strategy. I too sometimes use bc. But just as when I pay with Euros, I purchase only as many bc as I need.
Currency speculation is arguably the worst investment strategy possible for any investor, from individual to institutional. I guess I get that for you the practice of buying and accumulating bc is sort of a hobby that functions as a forced savings mechanism. That seems reasonable enough. 
I would say though that if you had put that money into a vanguard 500 you'd have the money to by twice as many of your favorite little coins..if you have paid on average $300 + per coin, you've lost a fair amount of your investment already..
