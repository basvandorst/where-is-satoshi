I don't think you realize how early we still are in crypto in general, bitcoin is like the Ford Model T. Give it time, child.

I've been trying to download the Eth blockchain for a few days now... 
I also paid like $3 in fees for one transaction recently. 
Eth is great but needs work too. The scale at which Eth is being used is still a tiny fraction of the potential global usage. 
I like them both but I think it is still too early to know what the future will hold for mass adoption. There is no single crypto ready for it in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:56:05
It doesn't. Maybe we will use something totally different. 
My point was really no one knows what will be adopted long term, so to say it will NEVER happen is pure speculation. 
Are you saying crypto in general will NEVER be adopted on a broad scale?
What is the most adopted crypto right now? I bet you can answer that really easily.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:06:13
Banks not letting you use your own money to buy something that is completely legal.
Makes me want more Crypto.
I would ditch Capital One if that happend to me. Thankfully I do not use them.

How the hell did BCH get on Coinbase before tons of other way more worthy coins?
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:39:14
Up until about July I used Bitcoin every week. Some online stores would give 10% - %20% discount for using it.
It was nice because you could buy Bitcoin , price goes up plus you get the discount, so it was like a double discount. 
We just grew too fast and can't handle the scale, which isn't a bad problem to have, scaling will be solved by Bitcoin or something else. As long as it's decentralized global immutable cryptographically secure ledger I will use it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:21:58
This is amazing.
I had a similar situation with an acquaintance who I told Bitcoin about that became absolutely obsessed with it. One of the few people who believed the info I was spreading.
This was about 3-4 years ago and I had a small issue when I needed some cash quickly so my acquaintance out of gratitude for how much Bitcoin changed his life (and lots of profit) agreed to buy some altcoins from me personally deposit cash into my account.
I lived on the opposite coast and this person could have easily turned me down as I was not very close with him other than our interest in technology.
Such an amazing community, Andreas deserves it more than anyone.

Don't places like Coinbase have an option to instantly convert to US$ to decrease the likeliness of losses and gains?
@_date: 2015-12-15 23:04:25
We don't write the software , we mainly do installation and support.
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:53:53
Don't give up, I got involved when BTC was $0.80 and sold at between $8 and $15 because I saw the backlash of the first goxing and silk road crashes. Big mistake, should have trusted my instincts and stayed strong, now I am back for the long haul.
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:32:47
As someone who has been involved with crypto since the beginning don't worry about it. 
They go up , they go down. Don't panic.
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:35:26
OP should see that these payments have zero fees and return to buyer with instruction on how to pay properly. It shows the fee amount right in the transaction.
@_date: 2014-02-13 01:39:26
Does 1 BTC sound fair to you?
@_date: 2014-08-28 03:54:00
I am pretty sure the average customer understands the difference between sending someone a gift and payment for a service/product.
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:50:08
Mining altcoins to trade for bitcoins is still profitable in some caes.
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:39:57
Wish I could go, little low on cash right now, $275 is a bit steep.
@_date: 2014-07-22 03:40:16
And if you do nothing?
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:13:48
Hmm price is $637 at BTC-E , this guy might be retarded.

They forgot "I am not Dorian Nakamoto."
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:25:52
My account was just verified, so does this mean I can go buy $100 bitcoins and withdraw them?
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:23:25
I think "newsweak" would have been the first red flag for me.  
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:17:37
Why is everyone pissing all over OP's curved parade?
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:40:41
I would be interested in that as well, I just moved from NY to NC and am having a hard time meeting like minded people.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:46:27
Hey I am need of a TV, if you are selling the one your replacing I'd be happy to take it off your hands.
@_date: 2014-08-27 16:41:14
Your customers are sending money as a gift instead of as payment for a service or product in order to avoid fees. Paypal is a business just like you and wants to make a profit as well. 
I know paypal can be shit some times but I don't see them doing anything wrong in this situation other than enforce their TOS.
@_date: 2014-03-09 14:00:57
Because asking is easier.

I had 300 bitcoins once, I sold them for $8 each :-(
@_date: 2014-07-22 03:13:52
Article says "never pay the ransom" , but if your data is worth well in excess of $300 I don't see why you shouldn't pay it. 
I worked as a technician for a retailer and had a loyal customer come in one day with his main business computer infected with Cryptolocker, I spent a couple of days trying to figure out if there is anything I can do to decrypt but there wasn't. Unfortunately his backup drive was plugged in during the encryption. So we paid it and we successfully decrypted and backed up the files to a drive that he would always keep offline.
@_date: 2014-07-22 06:26:20
He had his backup drive plugged into the PC when the virus hit, so it encrypted his backup drive as well.
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:37:09
Can anyone explain all this, and what it means exactly?
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:48:07
How many bitcoins do you mine a day with 20TH?
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:39:39
They forgot "I am not Dorian Nakamoto."
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:35:08
People like Andreas is why Bitcoin will succeed.
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:32:53
If you are verified why is it hard to get USD into gox?
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:59:00
**Here are some that I own....**
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:22:09
Is there one in NYC yet? 
@_date: 2014-07-19 17:59:03
I wonder how much the individuals banked off of selling those alpaca socks. If they saved even a small percentage of the coins they must be filthy now.
@_date: 2017-03-12 02:25:02
One of the transactions will not be confirmed. No bitcoins will be created.
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:19:40
I may need about 300 BTC with GPUs way back and sold them a for around $10-$12 each. 
Best part was I had to go away for 2 months and had actually configured my machines to keep mining while I was gone, even if they crashed they auto restarted,  would have been absolutely genius if I hadn't sold.
@_date: 2016-12-02 00:35:43
As with VPN networks there may be some data of interest to this parties on your network. 
What kind of logging takes place and how long is that it stored on your servers? 
What country are you based out of? 
@_date: 2016-11-03 02:14:54
I was just looking through my old transactions  history. 
Man is it depressing,  sending 50BTC out every few days to sell for peanuts.  
I need a doctor. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 09:15:43
I don't see it either. just downloaded.
@_date: 2016-12-02 01:38:57
For sure,  my recommendation would be to make a goal to have zero data or meta data related to access to the service,  chat initiations, etc left on your server once a chat has been cleared.  This could save you a ton of headaches in the future if someone is looking for data and you can show that as a part of the design the data is automatically removed and unretreviable.  
The log of connections to the server and data about who is talking to who is a big one,  just as important as the messages themselves. 
Having that as a part of your system will make it much more attractive from a privacy standpoint.
@_date: 2016-11-13 23:48:36
I got verified with Circle app in under 5 mins,  uses your cell phone camera to submit docs right within the app. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 01:32:25
Encryption is nice but what about the deletion of old data? For example if I have a chat today would the data exist on a server somewhere in a week,  month,  year etc? 
@_date: 2016-12-20 00:18:21
Does having Bitcoin Core running mean I'm running a  full node?
Serious question.
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:52:24
Thanks I didn't realize that was a thing. I decided to just go ahead and send my second transaction with a beefy fee and was confirmed immediately.
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:49:25
Awesome, that worked way faster than I expected. 2 confirmations already.
@_date: 2016-10-20 09:00:08
In the POS world we still use them, not exclusively though. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 00:45:59
Will upgrading the client reset the location the blocks are saved to the default? 
@_date: 2017-05-03 14:36:37
That is a good point.
@_date: 2017-05-03 08:32:03
Man if the CIA has control of Satoshis keys that would be interesting. If the order came that BTC needed to be stopped they could probably pull it off by selling Satoshis fortune and sending the market into a panic.
@_date: 2016-10-18 13:02:59
I did it all from the app, you take pictures of everything from right within the app, its really seamless. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 11:31:50
I used circle for the first time the other day and the verification was super easy,  take picture of ID,  take selfie,  verified in 5 mins. Also can link bank account with just login,  no account number.  Was impressed.
@_date: 2017-07-03 02:25:01
Do you know the name of the particular POS software you are using?
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:33:04
Been member for a while, flawless service from my experience , worth the money.
