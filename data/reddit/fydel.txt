Ok. Thank you for the info. But source please?
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:15:01
Damn. I think I noticed some similar behaviour last year but I did not look deeper into it. Can't remember why.
But thanks again for your elaborate answer.

@_date: 2013-03-18 19:17:18
Thank you, mate. I will do as you advise.

It's very easy as long as you follow some safety rules and common sense.
The biggest exchange is  with 80% of the volume.
But If you live in Europe you better check out  as they have no fees.
Take a look at the  forum. Its a good place to start.

Any updates on that issue? 
I would like to flattr more people but I hate using evil PayPal for adding funds.

Thanks for the link to his User Page. 
I am shocked. I thought only cool people use Bitcoins.
This user believes the separation of church and state is heresy.
This user wants the United Nations to be dissolved.
=&gt; This user is homeschooled.

It would be great to have an ASIC supplier here in Europe. 
But they doesn't seem to be legit. It sounds just to good to be true..

Was slush's MtGox Bridge downloading data?
Do you have files in the Data folder?
It looks like your .dat files are empty.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:03:40
Damn. I am so stupid.
Edit: Thanks, nkuttler. Again.

 uploaders: better check if everything is still there.  There was a problem with the first uploads and you won't be emailed if affected.

Any more proof than this db "dump"?
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:40:54
I am using  for months now. It's nearly the biggest EUR exchange and has proven to be very reliable. 
It has zero fees for trading which is remarkable.
You can add some funds via Giropay, SEPA/Wire, Sofortüberweisung and Credit Card.
Also the community and the admin is very friendly and helpful.

Sorry. I just noticed that as far as I can see you can not backup your private key in Electrum directly. But you can create a backup of your wallet.dat file which can be imported into most other clients. This file contains your keys.
@_date: 2013-03-16 14:22:01
Thank you for sharing. I will give it a try.
@_date: 2013-04-07 11:16:02
Huch. TIL that the Twitter account Vircurex does not belong to Vircurex and  they will be back at14h GMT
@_date: 2013-03-10 21:55:57
@_date: 2013-03-02 20:30:54
Indeed. So as long as you backup your keys, Electrum it is perfectly safe to use.

Donating 50 BTC to Luke-Jr is the final proof that BFL is full of shit.
Why not donate the rest to the NRA or NSDAP/AO? 
@_date: 2013-03-10 21:25:38
yes, xrandr is right.
@_date: 2013-06-25 15:30:00
This is an outrage! It is the defamation of all bald people.
Wearing only skin on my head I feel very offended and will never use Bitpay again.
