No, linear scaling is NOT scaling. It's called postponing.
A real scaling solution won't have to be touched once deployed.

I don't need your day to day transaction like buying coffe, renting a bike, paying your weekly porn subscription, or your gamble on satoshidice wrote in my computer forever.
If you want to have a track on the blockchain, no problem, but bundle them in only one transaction which give the status at a T time. Like closing a Lightning channel. This will cost you a total of 2 transaction, but all your personnal transaction are only usefull to you.

There are 2 billions in circulation, not 1.6 as your link is trying to tell us (real information here :  )
Also, accordind to  there are 950 000 000 tether which have been printed since 12/19/2017. The double of your affirmation.

When you click the check review on their article it says coin accepted " Etherium". And their webpage are so looking good ! 
I'm sure that everything will be fine for you with this scam ! Send your money, never receive anything.

You should learn about tether possible fraud... If true, there is no reason we reach this level anytime soon. But it could also be total speculation. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:57:23
I would not try. Bitstamp is safe, coinbase too but they lack customer experience and development
To not get scammed, save website in bookmark, never click ad in Google result. Transfert your coin to an offline wallet when purchased. Always use 2FA (and NOT with SMS !). Always use strong passwords, and never use the same twice.
Do not trust offers "to good to be true" (like recent scam bitconnect)

Sure it's possible to reverse it later... Wait no, the information wrote after a block increase would stay forever in the blockchain. This will not reduce it's size.
When the total size would be greater than few terabyte, it will be to late to say "fuck, let reduce block size". It will not reduce thé blockchain bloated with useless transaction. 
Offchain solution is what we need.

So, what append if A and C works together to fraud person B ? Transaction seems to not be atomic, so A want to send money to C throught B. A should send money to B after him receiving the proof of payment. What append if he never send the money ? As I said, it seems to not be atomic, so there will be a frame (even some nanoseconds) where all balance are not updated for every chanel. How am I sure (as person B in this example) that person A and C will not try to time this small frame to close their channel before paying me ?
Thanks.

@_date: 2017-12-13 19:47:54
What if person B is a scammer and update balance on channel A-B, but doesn't do the second part of the contract, and close both channel A-B and B-C before updating balance on B-C channel ?? A lose money, C don't get it, and B vanish ?

With some synology models, you can install chroot debian (it's in synocomunity sources).
With that it's like a real debian, when you forward port from outside to the nas, you can access services in the chroot without any more configuration.
Maybe you can install it in your nas. You then access it from ssh.

What if it would turn into an attack against Bitcoin ? If it's only one person (or small group) that add continuously some hashrate, and, at a certain moment turn everything off or on another chain.
Thus Bitcoin block time would increase to something like 1 block / 2 hours and next recalculation would be far far away.
Does something could be done easilly in that case ? Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:20:42
You think that when banks were created, everybody ran to give their money to them ?
No, and it will take time before everybody takes control of their wealth again.
Be patient. Revolution is on it's way.
Banks were not created as we know them as today. Bitcoin neither and it will continue to evolve and attract more and more people.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:29:05
Nevermind, if someone had so much power to lower block time to 1 block / 2 hours, Bitcoin would be fucked because he could easilly do a 51% attack

Yeah, they take a cut on the deposit, another when you exchange for linden dollars, a third one when you buy bitcoins, and, finally, a last cut when you withdraw.

You have to fork long before the quantum computer is able to hurt Bitcoin.
If we wait for the very last time and the guy who own this computer can crack every public key and find all the private key, you can fork as much as you want, the guy with all thoses private key will be able to spend the btc on future fork also. 
Not to say that every one must be able to move their funds to a more secure encryption, and with all those unspent output, it will take some time.
But well, we are not there yet.

Hint they are not lost "forever"
Who know, in 100, 200, 1000years, maybe new technologies will be able to collect them a second time. And since, the protocol will have a better security for regular users.
That not because we won't see it that it will never happen.

Sure, if nobody care anymore about improving the protocol and client, Bitcoin would die, and maybe another could take its place.
Another way would be if encryption were broke, another coin could become the leader.
But as long as it works fine and people develop on it, I really don't think it will die soon.

Price level doesn't matter. One year ago you were able to buy 1btc for 1000$. Today you can buy 0.11btc for the same amount. That not the same amount of btc, OK, but you can still buy the same amount of goods with it. 1000$ still 1000$ (except the inflation). 
Or maybe you were here "investing" in the get rich quick scheme ?
Well, we are here to try to replace banking system. So price level don't matter as long as btc works as expected. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 23:34:29

You can check your words are written correctly by first reset your ledger and re-importing the seed. Once you are convinced, you can transfert your coins to it.
For the firmware, the risk is, if a security issue will be discovered in the future which can be used to read seed from the ledger and someone stole it, he could theoricaly do it and steal your funds. This kind of issue has been seen on trezor.

Well the deal could be 100k lended today and 100k paid back in 5 years. As Bitcoin is a deflationnary system the price in 5 year would be higher than today (in theory)
