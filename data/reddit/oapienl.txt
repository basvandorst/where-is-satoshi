Its a lot more what they say. Milions of euros have the dutch people in crypto. They say 100thousends euros. thats not true. I have made in 2 years time more as half million dollar in crypto.
 Look on al blockchainexplorers. on every circle diagram you can find the dutch flag.  I think every token or coin we are in the top 10 hodlers.

banning currency to fiat exchanges solved no problems and the banks know that. 
what you can get is : He pays me cash, i send the coins. I Need money, he give me criminal drug money. I have drug monney , he send me the coins. He need cash, i Buy coins. That is the same way how it works to day on litebit or coinbase. And coinbase and litebit make only profit from the fee and lower prices.    Result:banks can not make money from the transactions anymore.  Conclusion, trading is endless and cant never be stopped.

Hi, yes with me good. Yeah thats a long time :)  The market is still bad. I expect that we can lower. Around the 5000 range. But around 6000 there is also strong support. I have most of my money in bitcoin. All coins are bleeding. Only with the Docademic ICO did I earn a lot. made around 40X . For the rest there is not much that can be done at the moment with all the coins. I think this is the last dip week.  The best option  is HODL and wait and see what will happen. You are most safe with that option because Bitcoin is currently Pump and Dump and Pump. Probably by banks that manupilate everything .

I do not listen to Tom Lee. I'd rather go outside to take a pee against a big tree ლ(´ڡ`ლ)
and still people who pay the tax neatly and well, for example the USA $ 25,000 -25% tax. $ 5000 giveaway to the govement. you remain poor with a poor amount.
Be realistic. there is nothing to earn from being good. you can earn money only with little criminal traits. Criminal is not shooting someone dead. Smarter as the government than you are often also criminal where they can not get a view. just being good does not pay and is boring too. The government also belongs to the group of criminals.
Do not just use your headline to look at charts that go up and down and sell on coinbase. If you think a little bit cleverly, just buy and sell your stuff with a piece of paper on a bulletin board in the supermarket where you can buy and sell dirty old junk and all that kind of shit or just on a kind of ebay marketplace
I've never paid a penny tax for it and I'm not going to do it either. I do not act so mysterious about it. I also told the police right in the face when I paid € 6500 in traffic fines last year with all € 50 bills at the police station. Well, there is money you have to work for a long time. I replied that I did not do a fuck and paid no fuck tax. And black money is money too.
But not only against agents.
Have it also right in the face of a tax bailiff who came about a car whine that I have not had for 3 years, where 1 bill of road tax was still open from 3 years old. that it just feels wonderful to have something that they can not pick from you and never pay them a penny for it.
Oh what do I want to say. Oh, I know it again. Do not listen to people calling prices. use that time to put some basic trading techniques into your head
I know for sure that bitcoin differs by more than 5 euros in a few seconds with the price of this moment

Richard is my name. I would recommend your UBQ. Large airdrop is coming April 25th. Hype has not started yet. nobody is still talking about it. All registered addresses with a UBQ balance will receive 12 ESCH tokens for every 1 UBQ
Buy and Hold makes you rich. I expect x10 maybe x20 gain. Because coinsupply is low 39,882,419 UBQ

This is awesome!! I was getting also crazy in recent days. Especially the coins under the dollar made the balance horrible. Was also ready with it because everything happened exactly differently. I even started to consciously buy coins that I knew was going to crash.
Have it solved for a moment. I split my balance into three parts what I have on different exchanges. First part left on bitcoin. I put the second part in ico token sales. The third part for a number of bitcoin went all-in on monero. because of the hard fork.
And now i keep this strong HODL
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:36:53
Yeah, it's amazing how he can encourage you. So no one is going to tap the panic button when you listen. 
If you are really addicted to the chart and can not do without it. And extreme hard to try HODL. then there is also a longer HODLahiti. nonstop 10hours support for free so you can not sell them anymore. (ง︡'-'︠)ง
10h support 
1h support 
playback speed at 1.5x if HODL already easier
playback speed at 0.5x if HODL is to hard for you

Heyy, Monero hardfork is on block 1529810. I thought I read that the hardfork will happen on March 14th. Then it's time for the screenshot to get the 1:10 MoneroV. When that block is over I will sell it as soon as possible.
Other altcoins are currently dangerous investments. It is not really recommended. Tradening is possible but then you have to sit with your nose all day long.
You then have to keep the live price chart of btc-usd constand open on a screen. and the graph of an altcoin that you want to trade.
Wand the cheaper a coin, the greater the chance of even greater losses.
I think Monero is a pretty save investment right now. Because of the airdrop of moneroV and because this coin is in a higher price category. you do not have to deal with huge price fluctuations.
But I can not give any guarantees if it also continues to rise up to the fork. wall bitcoins will determine it.

Is it even worse than spooning? An effect when the tension has risen too high and just hit the panic button as a compulsive disorder.

ubiq smart contracts can also be made just like ethereum and neo. Only he is undervalued at the moment. there are 5 airdrops of esch coming this year. in April, July, October, January 2019, April 2019.
do not go right in all but first buy 10% of your available money. if the value in btc drops by 20 to 30% you buy another 10 percent of your available money.
between 0.00015000 and 0.00024000 is best for a buy.
The only thing that can work against is bitcoin. if the lower and lower continues to crash then bitcoin takes everything

Hi, yes what is written there is 100% correct. there is no question about it. Do not let believers come to prove that they do not. This is even exactly what I thought. I have often warned for the last couple of months. who is behind it and why it crashes. and that I am heavily against regulation to make gains later of 1% per week if it is regulated. People believe more in the honesty of those scammers. such as your own government, banks, twitter, facebook, google, alll world leaders, regulators. just anyone who has let you know how bad bitcoin is through the news belongs to the cartels.
and i know for sure the most scam icos are also created by them.
make sure that you do not give up your crypto coins with the tax. As long as they do not pass on information to their knowledge, they do not see it either. You can earn a lot of money with that. By not paying tax on the coins. You can simply still buy and sell anonymously against cash without it being noticed that you have earned that with crypto.

hey, The market is indeed difficult to predict. I kept most of my balance sold the most for usdt at about $ 16,000 and had my purchase orders put on $ 6100 which was delivered 2 months ago. I almost tripled my balance in btc. I printed 15btc on 15 paperwallets for the long term and are safe for theft. The other part I trade that I have put in icos or bought good coins I hold a few altcoins that can still increase this year. I sold the other altcoins at the beginning of the crash. Ubiq I bought extra from last week and also 100 ether 400 neo. 4000aion. But at this moment im not going to sell for usdt. Ubiq did well today. It went up almost 100%

Buy on coinbase generate Send money  to new generated  Bitcoin wallet without 3th parties. Send money to that wallet. DONE! After this they cant proof that you te owner of that wallet.  I use never a mixer. I see no different if i buyed goods with crypto or sent cash to new generated wallet.
Government steal only your money for tax.

I don't care what they say.
I also do not pay tax on my crypto.
I do not  finance a war.  or finance that all tax money is literally thrown away at nothing at all. It only ends up in the pockets of bag fillers.
Bitcoin energy waste? NO! its verry green .
Bitcoin mining does not cost much energy at all. It is a very green way of working.
add up everything worldwide from a bank worldwide such as ATMS, Offices, skyscrapers, headquaters, coin press factories, coin factories. total people worldwide who work for a bank. They all work behind a PC, with large servers.
So bitcoin is one of the biggest thing of value and banks word have this for making more money
Banks hate cash money, its woth nothing.
Govement = Mafia = Central Banks.

In addition to trading in crypto coins, I also have a lot of ferro, non-ferro and PGM metals such as milberry copper, bronze, gold, silver, Iridium, Rhodium, Palladium, Tantalum, Platinum.
I have everything at home under my own management, I refine all these metals myself from electronics and scrap. The advantage is that I pay nothing for this stuff. 
I dont sell the PGM metals, but i will save them. Because this are very rare metals
people must think much further then gold or silver. There are many rarer metals that people forget. I can only think about that metals because the demand only gets bigger. Gold is used less and less in consumer electronics. 
 
Rhodium € 70000 kg
Iridium € 41.829 kg
24K Gold € 35800 kg,
Palladium € 35200 kg,
Platinum € 22200 kg
Tantalum € 185 kg,

 60s 70s 80s 90s to begin 2000s  There used to be more gold in electronics than it would think. Especially susceptible to malfunctions was very thick gilded such as communication systems, telephone exchanges, transmitters, radars, computers, game consoles. Largest part was formerly gilded with a thick layer of gold.   Pure gold was also used, but that is hidden in the chip. are miscoscopic thin micro hairs. .  In Pentium Pro desktops with pro goldcap cpu you have 1 gram of 24k gold after refining. All hardware was also quite thickly gilded and completely along the length  Nowadays you do not even get 1 gram from 30 modern cpus or even even from 30 computers. Nowadays the pins on the motherboard are almost empty of gold.  Where you can still find a lot of gold is army equipment.
