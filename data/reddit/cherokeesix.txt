How many of you appreciate the FDIC a bit more now?

"A recognized form of exchange can be a form of money or currency, or a commodity like gold, silver or financial capital. To act as a store of value, these forms must be able to be saved and retrieved at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved."
Predictability is key. Bitcoin is not predictable, and in some instances cannot be retrieved (Mt. Gox).

It's not that he doesn't understand them. He understands them perfectly well. It's that he doesn't understand their long-term value, and how they can justify the lofty valuations that they have. Those are two very different things.

Not sure what you experienced, but the currency is the dollar. Everyone uses it. I travel there multiple times per year for work.

Or drop 50% in a week? Most businesses are smart enough to gamble with their revenue. 
Sure, Bitcoin could be worth 10,000 next year. It could also be worth zero. And until it stables out, no smart business will do their day to day activities in Bitcoin.

Gold is an asset. Bitcoin is a currency. They need to be viewed differently.

Key phrase: 'Immediately convert'. So really, he is just accepting payments in dollars.

Which will never happen so long as Bitcoin remains this volatile.

It's just buy and hold speculation right now.

This is like watching a penny stock.

And will then immediately convert the Bitcoins to dollars. So really, he is just accepting payments in dollars.
How is this significant?

Merchants rarely keep Bitcoins. They instantly convert them to dollars, due to the instability of Bitcoin. Most merchants 'accept' Bitcoin as a marketing ploy more than anything. I'm sure Amazon, if it were to ever accept them, would do the exact same thing.

Bitcoin has nowhere near enough liquidity for this to be worthwhile for him ..

Those arent "Krugman" points. They are Econ 101 points that are widely accepted by everyone in the economic field including both liberal and conservative economists. 
Deflation is bad. And the experiences of every country that has experienced it should be evidence enough of that point.

And that is exactly why we have Central Banks!
