I can guarantee you that a Security Audit is very important and will be performed if we have enough money for it before we hit stable.
This isn't an official TODO (we give wiki accounts to anyone that asks for one) and is quite outdated.
This is our official TODO:

Getting an unfinished, alpha codebase audited when many things can still change isn't very smart especially when we currently don't have nearly enough money to get our code audited.

One to one audio, video and file transfers work.
Last week, groupchat audio was implemented.

It's fully distributed, secure by default and easy to use. 
Just run it, add a friend, wait for them to come online and you are chatting securely. 
Everything is encrypted, you don't have to go mess with your router settings to make it work and there are no central servers.

It would not be in core but something on top of core.

It's good to know that this is possible with Bitcoin.
Thank you.

Thank you.

The clients or a library running on top of toxcore.
The only protocol related thing that could happen is a new packet type.

Thank you.

It's an open source project so anyone can look at the design and code.
We plan to have a proper audit right before stable if we have the money (audits are expensive).
For crypto we use NaCl:  (more specifically the crypto_box() function.).
This should give you some more details, (it's not finished yet but should give you an overview of how Tox works):
@_date: 2014-11-17 21:24:17
The uTox client does.
Just select desktop as your video input and click drag to select the area you want to share.
Note that video quality will be horrible currently for high resolutions as Tox doesn't have auto bitrate adjustment for video yet.

We face some of the same adoption related issues Bitcoin does. With effort, I'm sure many people will use Tox if it has a nice interface and it works very well.
The micro Bitcoin transactions could be the way to have the phone calling of skype in a fully decentralized matter which might be the killer functionality we need. It might also be something else, Bitcoin broadens our possibilities a lot.


I looked at their page and I didn't see any source code or even any explanation on how their system will work. It speaks about Bitcoin but then they say their system isn't based on Bitcoin but on a new crypto currency. Also, the emphasis on their page seems to be for a pre sale of their crypto currency.


How are they going to prevent people from gaming the system with fake users (bots)?
Unless I missed something on their page, gems is most likely a scam.
@_date: 2014-11-17 21:59:48
A library most likely.
This is obviously not a priority feature so it won't happen anytime soon (unless someone else does it) as there are many more important things to implement in Tox currently (like get the video working really well).
It's good to explore our options early though.

We have our own repo with binaries updated every time a new commit is pushed:
I don't know when it will be added to the official ubuntu repo.

One use case could be services like Tox to phone gateways where you could pay the gateway to make a phone call to the real phone network. So it would be small amounts but not too small.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:48:49
Using something centralized defeats the point of using bitcoin though.
@_date: 2014-11-18 13:48:11
If they are your friend on Tox you probably know them enough to know their Bitcoin address or can easily ask them for it so a friend tipping functionality would be useless in my opinion.
The main use case is potentially payed services that you can connect to and use.

Distributed in the no central servers sense.
With jitsi your account is stored on a server. With Tox, your "account" (private key + contacts) is stored in a file on your computer like Bitcoin. Also, there is no way to disable the encryption in Tox.
Jitsi also has issues with certain NATs while Tox works pretty much everywhere you have internet access.
@_date: 2014-11-18 13:43:01


I don't like the way some messenger clients invade and spam your contact list, it feels invasive. 
Next time you send a file to someone with skype and it takes a long time, make them run Tox and transfer the file with Tox. This is how some people managed to switch their friends over (File transfers are usually much faster with Tox because it doesn't go through any slow skype servers). 
Also, Thank you for the tip, I appreciate it.

Making a user friendly PGP isn't hard, it's exactly what whatever "secure" email service would have done if they actually wanted to improve email privacy.
Instead we get all this web based crap that says they are more secure than gmail/etc.. because they have some javascript crypto delivered by their site. At least with gmail you know google has access to your mail.
Bitmessage has the right idea though I don't think it has what it takes to make people that use email switch to it.

A proper way to end to end encrypt emails has existed for years. It's called PGP.
This is another centralized email service that offers exactly nothing in terms of privacy. It would be ridiculously easy for them to decrypt the emails on their service (if they are even encrypted in the first place). They receive all emails and send all emails from/to other providers in plain text (that's how email works) and browser based crypto is broken especially when the code is served dynamically by a server.
All you are doing is trusting another company instead of google/microsoft/whatever which isn't an improvement at all.
Use PGP, it works on every email provider and you can be actually sure only the intended recipient reads it, don't rely on centralized services that only promise to not look at your mails and mislead people by saying there is no way they can read your mails.
Also, I don't think the swiss data protection laws apply to non citizens.

A huge amount of community projects never leave the planning stage and this is one of them. Unfortunately this happens all the time. 
Making successful open source software is difficult.
