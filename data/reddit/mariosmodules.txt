Get all your cars up the onramps before they all close.

No. If you sell maybe.

You don't own any Bitcoin if it's on Robinhood. You own the monetary value of some amount of Bitcoin. Unless you use a Bitcoin wallet and own the private keys you do not have Bitcoin.

My theory about Satoshi: he worked for some company with an IP assignment clause in the contract, so he can't associate his real identity or else he'd be destroyed by the company claiming damages for the current market cap of Bitcoin itself. Hasn't lost the private keys, could totally move his coins - but doing so might expose him, and he's going to wait past the statute of limitations for contract law wherever that contract was made. This person probably is still in Bitcoin but not an active developer.

Where are your coins? Where are you seeing the value go up? Where do you see your funds going down?

Oh, a Canadian Bitcoin, eh?

I spend it and immediately replenish it. I use it like a credit card in that way. Otherwise I hodl

Would you want a supply chain attack to be that readily available? Buy trezor from trezor, no one else.

That site predicts Bitcoin will return 5% over 5 years. That makes Bitcoin worse than a high yield savings account.

Hold. It's a dumb meme

Well I would have 1000 extra dollars of Bitcoin every month

The only altcoin I see with merit is monero.

Satoshi and Bitcoin are both pseudonymous and I think that's intentional and should never change.

We're in the same boat

So in cases where the latency is too severe, would a supercoin with a really slow blockchain used as a medium of exchange between two high latency locations solve the problem? There would in this case for example be BitcoinEarth and BitcoinMars and in between a coin that has 2 hour blocks and is exchanged for the local currency.

Lol there is no way he's Satoshi if he's touting a centralized currency with cloud backup

To summarize the article
1. Don't buy some stuff that's not Bitcoin. Buy Bitcoin instead.
2. Buy Bitcoin
3. Buy Bitcoin
Thanks for the insights.

BTC requires an internet of sorts. A network of nodes. These nodes could be connected via ham radio for all they care. The point of the internet is that it's decentralized and impervious to large parts of it going down and it reroutes and adapts. Assuming the whole internet went down and no computer could ever talk to another one again, centralized fiat currencies would all fail as well as the majority of their value is digitally kept. So it's an absurd question without the comparison to other currencies.
Edit: what's interesting is that Bitcoin could start up again easily. Get some computers connected again, enter your wallet seeds. Bitcoin survives. As long as the codebase exists still and someone somewhere has a copy of the blockchain, even if every computer was trashed Bitcoin could start again.
