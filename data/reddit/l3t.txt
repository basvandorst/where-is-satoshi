There's plenty of stories like this. THe most interesting is how the biggest exchange ever Mt Gox went bankrupt after losing a good 75% of their BTC due to a 'hack' and owing heaps. But now they are liquid once again as even those 25% they have recovered are worth 10 X more.

well at least after a meteor breaking up Earth and killing us all, at least the next civilization can get straight back to mining gold.

Agreed. No one spends bitcoin. Forgot to mention that amongst all the others I listed in my argument:
 I find it hard to argue any of those points *for* bitcoin:


  -  Nope. When grandma got cryptolocked it was 1 week later before she got through to me. And its getting harder and harder to use as the blockchain gets bigger. Hardly anyone has their own wallet unless you're happy to download 150GB of data, growing +50Gb every year (grows by more each year)


 -  Cryptography is tamper proof. BUt thats blockchain. Not bitcoin. Bitcoin is SO hungry on reources its actually led to its weakness (having to fork), and the REASON why litecoins have come about. And as a currency its incredibly easy to manipulate. DDOS affects pricing, as does exchange hacks, and artificial trading (the back and forth that exchanges do to fluff up their trade numbers. IMO its why it will fail


- Wow.So NO. Uses up more energy than most African countries, and the dream of peer-to-peer microtransaction was lost a long time ago. Good luck getting a transaction confirmed within hours unless you pay significant overhead.
Dont get me wrong I love cryptocurrencies, but I seriously have my doubts Bitcoin has staying power, and believe its easily replaceable with one that stands up in every way to those 3 factors.
This is a VERY flawed article. Stinks of copy pasta for "flavor of the month" upvotes. LAME

OK but i'll bite: if you had equivalent bars of gold or 100 BTC in front of you now, which would you choose?
Cool. All of a sudden your laptop gets stolen. All of a sudden your internet connection is severed. Your wife calls and your daughter has just been kidnapped. Just a thought experiment.
Id love if bitcoin replaced FIAT (and it will,... well some *instance* of it), but its not a replacement of gold as much as the facebook twins will try and convince you.

as much as i love bitcoin, if the whole system failed, id possibly prefer gold. or cans of SPAM.

yeh but your wallet isnt on the internet. its on your devices, which are all now /dev/null. Unless you have an online wallet, then no worries you are 100% safe from everything. Rest peacefully...

Although for the fact we need 'difficulty' otherwise mining wouldnt have any value competitively, I always think its a pity how much power is used just because of a set 'difficulty'.
But on the flipside, i see a future where electricity is almost free thanks to solar/renewables, and crypto evolves to some other 'difficulty' apart from computing power.
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:00:34
Yes but you cant factor in stupidity. There may be a known finite amount of coins being mined at x date, but how many of them are available? ie. how many are in someone's wallet who is alive and has access to them?
No getting those coins back if i accidentally send 100 BTC into the ether because of a typo.
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:01:45
I reckon lost coins would make up an even greater portion of the growing btc scarcity over time.

We are in gold rush times I suppose.

I still find it strange how its a deflationary currency, so will continue going up. Everyone who asks me "Should I invest?" I tell them "of course, it will keep going up, you cant lose unless it collapses".
You can still buy x amount of BTC and hold onto them and it will be worth =(date-2009)/2140 x 21 million*
*made this up but u get the idea.
Really its just like gold but carries the risk of failure (which i suppose is just trust, but still i cannot fathom or process the concept compared to FIAT, I mean it just seems **obvious** to invest and hold- but i cant bring myself to).

yeh ive been overpaying. Who should i ask about getting a refund? Ive got my yellow pages open at 'Nakamoto' but cant find a satoshi.
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:03:16
Yes and yes. Although sure they didnt have huge machines calculating complex hashes, it still served the purpose of a public ledger recording transactions that could only be decoded through their own primitive 'algorithms'. (they even kept multiple copies locked away in tombs, there are simliarities, obviously computing power was not one of them).

actually satoshi never mentioned the term blockchain at all in his whitepaper. But it if you want to nit-pick there is many times the term is mentioned going back to [the 70's](
Anyway quit being such [a Dan!]( im reading a book on ancient civilisations and the more I hear about how they used their "rope ledger" the more it parallels an ancient version of a blockchain. In their case every benefactor knotted on the rope held their own replica, and when challenged they would unlock the emperors copy from the guarded tomb, and using an ancient cipher/decipher on clay tablets they would compare lengths, strands, placement and colour of twine on the rope. Uncanny if you ask me. Obviously given modern abilities we have it evolved into what we understand and interpret as our *beloved* blockchain, they didnt quite have RSA just yet, but they used what they had/knew (planetary alignment, base 10, substitution cipher like ROT13 which still needed a key to unlock) which I was impressed enough with to post on so THERE.

I have a bunch of these. I find the million dollar\billion dollar notes more practical when pulling off the "I'm a millionaire, let me show you", as trillionaire sound bullshit from the get-go.
Surprisingly Zimbabwe is big into bitcoin, and even a darknet market place was set up there to trade illegally (mainly in forex and fuel).

Of course. This is just google home page with custom tags. But yes, its extra amusing when my dad sends me a Guardian stock standard bitcoin article he has happened upon, as if to say "hey that thing u mentioned, i remembered you mentioned it LOOK" :-D

If you can hack SWIFT you have hacked the system. Basically have money on tap. 
Im consistently surprised that the hackers skilled enough to hack bitcoin exchanges with the best opsec available, and bounty programs to pentest and reinforce their security further, are still not able to break SWIFT such that it has to re-invent/replace itself the same way other systems are cracked. What is so hard about SWIFT? and what is its history of being hacked for monetary gain?

Yeh, I suppose so. 
Really i'm loling at the laggers finally coming to, mildly annoyed at how the news sites proclaiming Bitcoin as if its breaking news and has the latest scoop FRESH off the press. But also surprised/amazed of how far ive come since first reading such headline 5 years or so ago (and possibly writing it off as so many have as be meaningless\worthless tech) :-)
