I have another mining PC I run currently has 3 970's and one 1050ti (got a really good deal on the 1050ti months back and planning on putting it in a build for my nephew later) pay for more than my electricity bill by them self. I can give you specifics if you want tomorrow. But essentially my bills covered each month, and I get a surplus of about 100+ each month which I don't think is a bad trade off for the amount it costs

Probably only mined during certain times and not 24/7. My 1070 makes me about $2.75-3.75 a day if I were to run it 24/7. Which in a month is anywhere from 82-112 USD per month

Looking for a new miner as well

I'd say it's well worth it to be honest. Off the top of my head I earn $240 usd a month and my bill is $150 cad (for a family of 5). The money I spent to build my mining "rig" was roughly $1000. With the previous market I get a surplus of $100-150 a month. So after 7-10 months all that equipment is paid off, my electricity bill is being paid, and I can continue to mine, build pcs for family or sell parts for real cheap.

Unfortunately older hardware isn't worth mining on.

1070 makes way more than $60 in 2 months. I play games with mine, and when I'm not I mine. It's simple

Was using nicehash on whatever pool was most profitable. Will definitely have to check nemos out

When I first started mining, it was just with my 1070. Up until now I've been using nicehash because of their automatic mining algorithm. Being deposited to coinbase (highly recommend). I'm Canadian so coinbase can't do a payout to me, so I transfer it to quadrigacx after to get paid. There is a transfer fee however well worth it because of the security of coinbase. 
Use MSI afterburner to find the sweet spot for overclocking your card, I have mine set to +150 core clock, +500 memory clock. I could easily push higher without fail, I'm just to find the sweet spot for my card and have 0 issues with that overclock. 
After that, start up your miner, benchmark and you're all set to go! 
If this is your main PC like me, don't forget to save settings on afterburner and restore it whenever you're ready to play. The overclock works fine for low usage games like league, but for CSGO or some AAA games you will experience tearing.
I mainly used to mine overnight, as electricity rates are cheaper then. Check your local rates and see what it's worth. I'm in Ontario so I googled Ontario electricity rates and the government website came up. I get charged 13.2 cents per Kw on peak(most expensive) and used that to fill nicehashs profitability calculator. Even during the most expensive time I was making a profit, so I went for it almost 24/7 except when I'm gaming. (My PC is always on anyways because my plex and team speak server so it wasn't a hard choice for me)
Someone recommended winminer to me in this thread since I asked for a replacement for nicehash. However I have not been able to try it out yet since I'm out of town with my gf. 
Edit 1: No luck finding a replacement for nicehash for myself yet, Vertcoin and nemos miner have proven to difficult me for to understand quickly. Winminer is not accepting new miners as of right now.

Per hour, not much. Per day around 0.0008-9 btc
