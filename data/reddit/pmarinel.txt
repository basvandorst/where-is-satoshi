That is what I figured. If you wouldn’t mind, what would you recommend for a wallet. I currently have a wallet from blockchain.info, but not sure if I should be looking into something different.

This looks so cool!

Sorry for ignorance and dumb question. But based on this I should definitely move coins from my Gemini account to a wallet (always sooner rather than later I guess), correct?

Ledger? Both are technically correct.
Ledger has apps for holding around 30+ coins (bitcoin, etheriun, neo, ripple, etc.). Where the tokens that are attached to coins like Etherium and Neo, for example, are also, by association, supported as well. That’s where the 700+ comes from. 
They probably could have done a better job spelling that one out.

Yea, but with the boom that is currently happening with everyone doing their own coins for whatever reason they are trying to solve its hard to see what will make it over the next 1,2,5,10,20 years. 
Doesn’t mean I’m not trying to identify coins that resonate with me as something I think are worthwhile. I can only hope that as I monitor these projects I’ll be able to see their success or failure and act accordingly.

My biggest regret was turning off the mining software back in 2011. I knew of bitcoin, had a wallet set up, installed the software to start mining, hit start and got my first transaction  from slushpool. I then decided to jump into the shower and hit stop (don’t know why) and never hit start again.

I sit and wonder if that was for the better. I’ve realized that the more I’m aware of something the more involved in the space that it’s in. If I had kept it up I probably would have been knee-deep in the community and would have definitely missed a lot of opportunities/events I’ve had because I wasn’t thinking about crypto. 
I also think about how unlikely I would have held onto the coins during those initial waves and how it’s unrealistic that I would have kept all those mined coins from then until now. 
Maybe it was for the better? Who knows.
