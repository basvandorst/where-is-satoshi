Are people really this dumb! Sorry OP.. But really!

Nope.. Actually just left it at my friend's house.. But worth some canvas, glue, paint and wood.. You can make your very own.. Stop buying stuff.. Have fun making it.

It is a bit of a parody I guess.. Girlfriend and I decided a nice way to spend an afternoon on holiday was to paint.. We had been all over Europe , just left Venice and were staying in a friend's house designed by the Italian architect Carlo Scarpa... If that is not inspiration to do 'something' then I don't know what is.
But I am about as bad as it gets with art.. I love it, have a broad spectrum of knowledge but tend to leave my creativity to code, digital solutions for companies and UX... BUT.. I am not too proud to try something I may not be good at.
But yes.. This really happened.. A man covered a canvas with glue.. Scraped two pieces of firewood together, let it dry then squeeze paint onto it to form candles.
I didn't intend to do this and the other 4 pieces I did are completely different and both good and terrible in their own way.. Well.. One was just plain terrible actually.
But people don't do this stuff any more just for the hell of it.. They wait for something to come along and amuse them.
And it reminded me of some of the people who post the most horrific 'Crypto art' on here, taking themselves very seriously and seeking donations and sales... I don't want your money.. But if one person decides making some art is something to do in their next free time versus open a browser or click on the TV.. Then it was worth it.

Yet almost a right of passage for those entering into crypto and trying to learn how crypto works.. But the next step is realising that it keeps working while you are not looking.. And your life is short and precious with A LOT of potential and things to do that will make you richer than money ever could.

I wouldn't waste good chilies for art ��
