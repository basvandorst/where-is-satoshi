Core could quite simply increase the blocksize limit so miners had the choice to increase the actual size of their mined blocks. This is how Bitcoin should work and I'm tired of explaining basic economic concepts of free markets and how artificial intervention/limitation won't have any positive effects for the users.
The way it is today miners have no choice of increasing blocksize by themselves as there is a hard-cap at 1MB (as you might know) - this is in fact crippling everything from the number of transactions to adoption and price. 
But yea you go ahead keep telling yourself that miners are at fault and twist reality until you fully live in your castle of dreams. What a fuckup this sub has become.
@_date: 2016-04-06 18:10:51
We can have bigger blocks and LN both, only it seems not with Core as their heads are too far up their asses.

The thing about the 1 year timeframe is correct, yet you have to admit that most of the worlds currencies got utterly destroyed in the last months, while Bitcoin didn't really budge. Most timeframes will show this.
At some point it will become obvious to most, that a currency which can't be diluted by printing more units will always increase in value against a currency that can and is being devalued at will, as long as at least some people use it of course.
This is real basic stuff here. 
Now I'm not sure you get the implications, maybe you are a US citizen happy with the USD but around the world shit is going to get expensive soon. Holding Bitcoin will save a lot of people from devaluation, if they decide so. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:54:11
They should be buying gold, it would secure them against a possibly rather weak Drachma exchange rate, as would BTC but with higher volatility risk. Or if they indeed stay with EUR it also negates EUR inflation.
@_date: 2015-06-13 17:53:24
What do you mean? There is just one blockchain to rule them all.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:46:16
Why would the bitcoin blockchain be destroyed if 25% of it's miners dropped out voluntarily (by forking)?
You are not making any sense.
The 25% stand to lose a lot of money. If it was so easy to destroy bitcoin don't you think some people would've tried this 25% "fork attack"?
@_date: 2015-06-27 11:06:54
Get this - Bitcoin is here and it ALREADY solves countless problems (by it's design alone) - people only have yet to understand this, sooner or later they will see the benefits and flock to this truly neutral currency, but this process takes time.
It will be used and with this usage development will accelerate. There is no way to stop this from happening if people are willing to use the currency. Even if someone manages to stifle development by spreading FUD or bribing a majority of devs, there is no way to stop anyone from forking and implementing those necessary changes.
In the end, miners will flock to the best currency, any attempt at stopping development and growth will lead to miners abandoning ship and keeping with the most decentralized and open currency. This is simple economics, and this is how anti-fragile systems really work, like a hydra.
Even if you manage to completely kill bitcoin, you just help with developing a more stable and resistant bitcoin v2. You showed where the flaws were and the next system just won't have those same flaws.

That's absolutely not how hedging works. To effectively hedge his BTC he would need a basket of fiat currencies like USD/EUR/CNY. Your scenario would be called gambling/speculation.
@_date: 2015-06-27 10:32:18
Correct. The yield on government bonds is only there because you also take risk of non-payment. Now the banks took massive risk by loaning money to greece when everyone already knew their economy is in total disarray. 
It's like playing roulette at the casino - putting all your money on red, then taking out some loans to put even more money you don't even own on red. Then if you lose just cry for a taxpayer bailout (because you're too big to fail) - but if you would've won, you would've kept all the profit to yourself and maybe even paid your employees a bonus. (Those employees that came up with the great idea to put everything on red - they must be geniuses)
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:57:58
Those numbers are realistic. Bitstamp probably didn't have a lot of Greek customers so a 80% increase doesn't have to be a lot of people.
Still, there were a lot of greeks with access to online banking when the bank holiday started, so it's not impossible for them to have bought some.

You are wasting your time on a subreddit dedicated to something you despise and "wouldn't touch" - whats your agenda?
Comparing BTC to CCs is just wrong in every way. It also shows you didn't get the technology part at all so please stop.
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:35:25
You are correct. The only thing I don't get is why you people still put up with this bullshit. 
Sticking with 1MB is a clear attempt at sabotage. There are people with loads of cash and big incentive to stop bitcoin in it's tracks, and they won't stop trying to push their agenda. 
We definitely need a system to increase blocksize without any more hard forks in the future, as those forks and the ensuing confusion could be the last attack vector they have (spreading FUD)
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:46:45
We do not compete with the moneylenders and credit sharks. Bitcoin is something new, it has no competition.

Increasing blocksize is not hampering the development of LN in any way, I don't get why people can't grasp this. We can have both.
Only LN is not ready yet, but we need to scale a little right now. Maybe you don't really use Bitcoin, but I'm still losing money while waiting for confirmations here. Right now.
@_date: 2016-03-09 18:45:15
This is artificial crippling though. 
A hard fork would be the opposite of kicking the can. If anyone is kicking cans, it's the core dev team. 
I'm happy you can afford double the usual fee, but I don't see why I should pay that much. With continued influx of users even your .0002 btc fee won't be enough at some point. Where's your limit? What's the line where nobody's going to want to afford those high fees anymore?
Wait, maybe I got the solution. User influx is going to stop due to loss of utility. So we're never going to see how it turns out anyway. Buhbye Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-03-10 15:48:48
You are right about this useful tool, yet we only need it due to unnecessary congestion. I'm not sure how you imagine a possibly exponential influx of new users, but we have no coded solutions yet - except a blocksize limit increase. 
Stalling the expansion and growth of our network is not going to help anyone except the competition - that is altcoins and banks.
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:26:21
A reliable system of transferring value would work for everyone all the time, not just for some people during some times of day. 
People are going to use the technology which offers the best combination of utility, security and accessibility. I wager Bitcoin loses it's  status within a year if nothing is done to combat this rampant sabotage of the Bitcoin protocol. 
Still waiting for my transaction to confirm while the mempool is growing, so I'm probably not the only one getting pissed again. 
Fuck. This.
@_date: 2016-03-10 15:31:40
I think you are onto something here. Maybe you are even right about LN properly handling my transactions within a year, although I don't believe in any timelines Core publicises. 
However, I feel we have entrusted Bitcoin development to a small cartel which has an enormous conflict of interest and is never going to act in our interest. Maybe you need to wait and see for another year how everything is stalling, but at some point you might realize what's going on.

Well I didn't compare them to Hitler, I said they are benefitting off current developments in Bitcoin, which is perfectly legal for a proper business - but I don't like a business in charge of the Bitcoin codebase. I see you just disagree here.
@_date: 2016-06-09 12:02:07
Comparing the blocksize limit to the coin limit is not a good analogy IMHO. But seeing as you also compared me to Hitler, you seem edgy to say the least. To me this is beyond disgusting and I won't answer to personal attacks.
Your definition of "good guys" is somewhat flawed, actually the whole "us vs. them" mentality is quite dangerous. And yes, I feel like Bitcoin is on it's way to becoming garbage, as you would put it.

@_date: 2016-06-09 12:28:05
It's not about rights either, I don't want to force anything onto you - quite the opposite. As you seem quite smart I'd hoped to find some understanding. 
It's about a hotfix satoshi made to counter spam transactions (short sightedly), which was never meant to be a permanent solution, but is now being used to cripple the network in a way that benefits blockstream. Now don't start with there's no urgency and the roadmap is out there - sure it is and I've already seen it, but to me it's nothing but more excuses and stalling. There might never be any true urgency to scale if we keep a hard cap like 1MB, it's like a self fulfilling prophecy.

Big financial interest behind keeping blocks small, big ideological interest behind raising the limit.
I'm up in arms because I can see how saboteurs are trying to overtake my beloved free currency by stalling any and all improvement for months now, while I can't do much besides posting my ideas.
Also, having a "bunch of nerds" argue in public is the best form of discussion you are going to get. I prefer this to secret meetings where politicians and lobbyists decide your fate without you knowing anything about it, or having any way of taking part in the decision-making process. Transparency is going to make sure we are getting real improvements, not just empty promises.
Actually your view of professionalism is skewed - I'd rather trust Bitcoin where everything is open source than the FED where a small circle of powerful people decides about monetary policy while you can pray they're acting in your best interest (good one!) -- still everyone trusts the mighty ol dollar!
With Bitcoin you will have real debate and real progress, with the FED you have someone telling you "just shut up everything is fine" - but today that's what we are taught to look at as professional (I mean they have to know better than me right? I'm just going to shut up, everything really seems fine...)

You are trying too hard here, just riddle me this: why strangle bitcoin with a 1mb limit UNTIL your idea of how sidechains should work becomes reality?
Why not instead let it grow, this should in no way stop the development of sidechains for specialized transactions. If anyone really needs those sidechains now they would get developed and used ASAP. Probably already happening.
A vote for a blocksize limit increase is in no way stopping the development of sidechains or the lightning network. You are talking about natural development but what you are proposing is in no way natural but rather artifically enforced limitation.
You are arguing to stop the natural development of Bitcoin and enforce your ideas. Blocksize should grow until effective sidechains take over, its the nature if decentralization. To stop this development from taking place naturally is sabotage and 100% profit motivated. It makes zero sense otherwise.
Actually I like your concept of coffee transactions on external chains but stopping a limit increase is not how it works. We can increase the limit today and your concept may still become reality if it's economically  feasible for all participants.

By vetoing any changes to the blocksize limit a small group was doing exactly that - determining the fate of bitcoin.
I just don't believe the 1MB camp is interested in any increase whatsoever, it's all just talk, debate and FUD. Fuck your consensus talk, show me something tangible, prove me wrong.

QE and ZIRP have decoupled markets from reality. There is no wage growth, the economy is going to shit, yet we are experiencing new all time highs in the stock market. This can and will not go on forever.

@_date: 2015-08-17 17:01:32
I feel you, but there is not going to be any legitimate response whatsoever. You still seem to believe there is no hidden agenda behind this whole debate.
They can't increase the blocksize limit, not even by a compromise. (Remember: the increase to 8MB was the first compromise down from 20MB) It's all bought and paid for, they are just trying to drag this out as long as possible, that's what they've been doing from the very start. It's sabotage.

It's raising the blocksize LIMIT, not the blocksize. The difference is the miners can choose to stay at 8mb blocks if they somehow don't like the limit doubling.
@_date: 2015-08-13 12:20:15
Bitcoin is already widely distributed, as long as blocks are being mined you won't be able to stop the distribution of coins anymore.

Sorry to break this to you but in a crisis Bitcoin price might even plummet with most other commodities. People are going to need their capital to pay back debt or feed their family, so they are going to draw money out of their investment vehicles be that stocks or bitcoin. 
Depending on Bitcoins performance measured against other currencies it might have an easier way out of the crisis, as fiat currencies will get devalued and people might start questioning their blind faith in central banks and lose their trust.

Your SAFE network is going to get eaten alive by anyone with enough hashing power and there goes your security. 
Don't tell me it's centralized, because that would just make it as useful (useless) as any other centralized database. 
I think some folks struggle to understand the true concept behind a decentralized trustless ledger. It's not just fancy new technology for storing data, it's all about the TRUSTLESS &amp; DECENTRALIZED part. 
If you think it makes sense to create a hundred more blockchains you missed the point entirely.

Only contentious in your mind
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:49:14
You don't seem to have much understanding either, as it's not about bigger blocks but about a bigger LIMIT.
With BIP 101 you do NOT need a soft fork for miners to keep blocks as small as they want them to be, it's theirs to choose.
This "fixed plan" is only concerning the artificial cap at the blocksize limit, not the actual blocksize.
@_date: 2015-08-06 18:36:49
Sorry I wasn't being clear enough. I actually agree with you and was talking about the companies/banks that try to build their own blockchain - they are the ones not realizing it's a waste of time and resources.

That's like saying it isn't a problem to securely store your bitcoin today. Yea it isn't for anyone who is willing and able to invest the time and effort to look up how to do it and properly generate a paper wallet.

You just can't send them anywhere without centralized entities clearing the transfer.
@_date: 2015-08-13 12:55:56
Yet you don't know about future performance, you are cherry picking timeframes to fit your comparison.
Is Bitcoin going to die with your Hrivnas? Is it going to recover? Can they print more Hrivnas and inflate your money away so you stay a slave forever? 
Will the dollar forever dominate everything?
Your call.
Bonus: Don't merely look at Bitcoin as investment. You shouldn't buy Bitcoin with the expectation of getting rich, this is just greedy.
But what if you want to leave the country with your fortune of 100000 USD or Hrivna equivalent? Dangerous to travel with so much cash, they are going to ask questions at the border to say the least. 
Now that we have invented digital money you can buy bitcoin, cross the border with a sheet of paper or a smartphone, and afterwards quickly sell your bitcoin so you don't suffer more exchange-rate volatility risk than necessary. 
Not only can you travel with Bitcoin safely stashed in your bag, you can also send it around the world. What if your goverment starts confiscating stuff, or the warzone moves near your town and again you find yourself having some cash lying around but maybe you can't move it yourself? If you want to give your money to some relative living in a safer place, you can just send it to them with Bitcoin and they can instantly trade it to their preferred currency to minimize any exchange-rate volatility. (Could you do that with your beloved Hrivna - the "just as good as bitcoin" investment?)
So - no investment, but practical value for a lot of people, that is the reality you and I both live in - if you instead choose to let them take control over your money you have only yourself to blame because the technology is already here, the solution to a lot of problems, you just have to start making use of it.
@_date: 2015-08-13 11:51:05
It's a blocksize LIMIT increase.
Miners can choose to stay at 8MB forever just like they chose to use 750kb instead of 1MB.

Low transaction fees are a main feature of Bitcoin. If your fees are skyrocketing, you might aswell use Western Union or any international wire transfer for that matter.
Bitcoin as a technology can be fast and cheap both, without any intermediaries, that's why it's so powerful and that's also why they so badly want to destroy it. Keeping some artificial limit on blocksize was never intended and only profits a small group of people.
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:43:37
Bitcoin should be accessible even for people who don't know how to look up the size of the spammers fee and set a custom fee above that.

@_date: 2015-08-06 20:21:52
You are completely right.
To use the multiple banks example - at best you would get a centralized ledger. You would also have to enforce those banks to use resources to mine and validate blocks WITHOUT any reward. How is this going to happen? Some kind of contract?
Most important: this is no innovation, banks already have inter-bank fiat transfer systems. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:08:16

To build your own blockchain is pretty ridiculous and a complete waste of money. Those companies will pay a dear price for "exploring" this "idea" while others already benefit of the existing bitcoin ecosystem.

Voice &amp; Exit is exactly what's happening here. First we were voicing our concerns about the system, voting for a change which never came. Now we are exiting the system forced upon us.

This guy is right, don't underestimate the cost of learning stuff.
Highly specialized engineers and doctors are paid a lot because they had to learn their trade for years. If any joker could set up a bitcoin POS they wouldn't be contacting you anyway, so for now you are in a position to charge above average. 
Also from my experience it looks way more professional if you charge a proper amount, it's highly specialized IT work after all, don't make it look cheap and worthless. If you want to be nice just write down less hours, especially if you're working a bit slow as it's your first project, but the hourly rate should be that of a professional in your country.

You are warping reality to fit your argument.
On the true Bitcoin network, the scalability issue has already been resolved, you just don't want to accept reality.

I'd at least try and see if the miners react, enforcing the hard limit forever definitely won't solve anything.

Spamming the network is a cool way of communicating? More like attempted blackmail...

We could increase the cost of sabotaging easily by raising blocksize a little. Yet saboteurs like yourself are the reason this is not done. Stop spreading lies.
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:21:42
So would you decrease it? Or would you have us believe 1MB somehow is the magic number? Or is it 731kb?
The word scaling in itself implies raising limitations, especially artificial ones. 
This ongoing debate is obvious sabotage and I'm not the first to point this out.

Right up until it's worthless

Fuck this, there shouldn't be any debate by now. If those devs think they can get away unscathed with this public sabotage of the bitcoin protocol they are wrong, I will personally inform each and every person that wants to know about your past misdeeds in the bitcoin space. It's all written down here, empty arguments, deception and lies. You can write whitepapers of 1159 pages but you will still be saboteurs and you are not welcome here anymore.

Manual adjustments are obviously not fine, otherwise we would already be adjusting.
Who says the next time we need to change something there won't be another group of individuals vetoing any and all proposals for change. After this debacle of a discussion we should make sure there isn't a fork needed ever again.
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:32:53
It would subsidize miners by increasing their income through fees 20x or more. 
A motivated attacker will always find attack vectors, stopping the growth and evolution of bitcoin is their goal, so we should evolve instead of stalling forever. It makes no sense to delay this anymore.
@_date: 2015-07-08 20:00:11
I agree, the transaction backlog just wouldn't be that big, so the whole problem is artificially created. And people are already offering money to make it go away, just raise the blocksize instead of effectively forcing everyone to pay more than necessary.
Be careful with litecoin though brother, looks like another pump. Give it some time, I think this is moving in the right direction and as this is a open-source project the better alternative will win in the long run, so 1MB-coin is just going to die a slow death if they don't abandon it instantly.

Exactly, until most coins are mined a stable price actually means ongoing buying/adoption on a daily basis. People seem to forget that all too quickly.

They are indeed creating their own coins with their own "blockchains" (see Citicoin, Hyperledger, etc), only they are centralized and therefore not trustless anymore.
By bashing the currency and black-market aspect of Bitcoin they are trying to make their own soon to be crypto currencies look more serious and trustworthy while they in fact wouldn't need a "blockchain" for centralized money transmission as this is already working with todays online-banking.
Open source, decentralized, trustless - their blockchain concoctions will never have any of these attributes and therefore shouldn't be taken seriously. Bitcoin is the next step in the evolution of money, not "blockchain technology".

Probably not so don't expect recovery. Also the dive wasn't really massive.

"Let's not change anything until it really gets necessary" - well what about right now?
By now this obvious sabotage should be clear to most if not everyone around here.

Yes. Look at Apple and shut your mouth. Super super low friction indeed.
If people like them, they will buy those devices like they buy overpriced iPhones.
Look, everyone talking about making Bitcoin easily accessible for the masses, well here you go!

Sounds great? 
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:42:49
Though you are basically right about holding your own private keys, using BitReserve is somewhat different. 
He was probably using their service to switch between currencies (trading) which makes holding your own keys near impossible (for now?)
@_date: 2015-09-23 20:07:23
Yessir, but now (soonish?) you can also send some Bitcoin to the car which might be used for gas or car toll. The car needs some kind of device for that. 
Why not send it directly to your wifes wallet? She might decide to spend it on something else. Put it in the car to make sure it's only spent for gas.
Also with the Blockchain you get a ledger to review all past gas payments, with colored coins maybe even a way to check when and where your car was started up the last time. 
You can always check how much BTC are still loaded on the car, you only need internet, and reload the balance if necessary without being physically present.
Just to make your brain work a little, what if you own a trucking business. Now you can perfectly control gas &amp; toll payments without having to trust your employees. You can see when and where each truck paid for gas/toll in real time.
How about public transport? What if you could pay by swiping your phone once when getting on the bus, once when getting off, and you automatically pay a fee based on how far you really traveled? Sounds fair to me. 
Driverless Taxis? Pay a token fee to get in (collateral) - get proper amount of change after arriving at your destination, without having to think about it. Taxi can now refill gas itself and transfer the remaining money to the business account, all perfectly documented on our beloved ledger.
A vending machine that pays out your bottle deposit in BTC and vends fresh bottles at the same time? Why not?
I feel like these days humankind isn't even trying to innovate anymore, but that doesn't mean there are no possible applications for this amazing technology. Who might realize them? Nobody knows. Well, just buy the new iPhone and shutup about Bitcoin already.
@_date: 2015-09-25 17:16:00
Correct to a point. You do not know speculators aren't already buying, so a significant rise might be happening before the halving, just like you said. But who knows when exactly? Or did it already happen?
The pricing of such events is never "done" but rather fluctuates with the knowledge of people and traders. There's a lot of uncertainty pressing down on price, if everyone knew Bitcoin would still exist next year (or in ten years for that matter) prices would probably be higher. 
In your efficient market every participant is 100% informed, yet I wager in reality there are lots of people holding Bitcoin not knowing about the halving, or what it really does. The more people get informed, the closer we get to our true price (be that above or below current price).
If you imagine the demand of Bitcoin as a constant stream of X BTC/h you will realize how the halving has to influence price at some point in time. The whole ecosystem will effectively have a tightened supply of Bitcoin to go around, so for price to stay the same we either need more holders to sell each day (why should they suddenly decide to sell?), less buyers/ reduced interest in Bitcoin, or higher velocity of money (read BTC) - the combination of these factors will determine daily price.

This fee is still artificially created via limiting blocksize, which in my eyes in a way even makes it fraudulent. It's not a natural market, but a restricted and construed farce.
I don't see what's left to discuss though, just curious how people can still accept the constant stalling and excuses rather than using fully coded and ready solutions :) it will be our downfall. 
You probably agree that not changing shit can also affect expectations about future adoption and price, which in turn affects actual price. We need to evolve and continue innovating to stay ahead.
