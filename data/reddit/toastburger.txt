A case related to this is [currently in front of the Supreme Court](

A definition of terms here would be useful, as well as an expected duration. Cash is a good store of value for time periods &lt;5-10 years, but not past that. On the other hand, the way you're talking about gold is more akin to an investment than a store of value. I don't think you can separate volatility from usefulness as a store of value--a good store of value should retain its worth regardless of the economic environment. Because gold prices are driven by speculation, they are inherently unreliable as stores of value. Let's say you bought $1,000 of gold in 1980 and held it for two decades. You'd wind up losing more than half the value--by 2000, it would be [only worth ~$460]( That's actually worse than the dollar's inflation over the same time period. In comparison, treasury bonds might have a low yield, but they retain their value exceptionally well.

Bullshit. Economics doesn't say anything of the sort. Bitcoin is a finite commodity, and it's price reflects scarcity vs demand. Nothing "impossible" about it. You'll notice, however, that I said "commodity", not "currency". Bitcoin does not act like a currency. In fact, Bitcoin is downright terrible as a currency:


This is the behavior of a commodity--"Digital gold" as some are wont to call it. And like gold, that makes it a shitty currency. Nobody wants to use a currency that's crashed five times in eight years. Nobody wants to worry about whether the markets are up or down when they do their grocery shopping. And that's why Bitcoin isn't primarily used as a currency. Nobody gets paid in Bitcoin. Very few people use it to pay for shopping with. Instead, the *vast* majority of Bitcoin transactions are in the form of speculation.

Cash. It's a far more stable store of value.

Cash is very stable, but yes it does lose value due to inflation. I would say it is still a better store of value than gold because its value fluctuates very little and very predictably. On the other hand, gold has seen double-digit variation in value in about half of the years in the last five decades. If you want something that doesn't lose as much value, then Treasury Bonds would be better.

Gold is a shitty store of value, like Bitcoin it's almost entirely speculative at this point.
