My friends, introduce and bring me in to the hodl culture! I just bought in my first $240 to BTC after watching it since July (Yea, I've had some regrets)

Tbh, thats part of my savings/rainy day fund. I'm still finishing my undergraduate studies in university, and my parents are still pretty much sheltering me at this point. I dont have responsibilities yet. If things in my life go all the way south, which is highly unlikely since I can always find a entry-level BPO job, I can still sustain myself for at least another month or two with what I have remaining. So I guess I'm okay with it, altho my hands do get cold with its volatility lol
Yes, I do have those kinds of goals for step two! Or actually, I just dont want to miss out on some potential profits; I'm planning to hold for long term so I think even if it crashes I wont really lose that much or still stand to gain some or break-even at some point in the future if things go bad.
For the third point, BTC is highly volatile from what I have observed but the gains are pretty big as well compared to if I had to trade or wait on stocks, or any other financial service that can increase money. Again, I also have enough confidence for BTC to at least sustain or again reach levels of $10,000-12,000 for the long term even if it encounters problems along the way.
Unless I believe governments and financial institutions were to suppress it as it stands; altho I am not experienced or knowledgeable enough on the topic to assume whether it would be good for BTC or not. At this point, I'm seeing BTC more of as a store of value primarily than that of an actual currency (medium of exchange).

Alright! True true, its more of a lifestyle thing, Im actually already prepared to lose at least 1/5 the value of what I put in! Im planning to withdraw half of it when it goes up by 50% and withdraw again when its goes 100% up from my initial point of investment so that I'll have no fear when holding (basically, Ive got all my initial eggs out already). Is this a good strategy? :O
