Is there a place to check how many transactions are added to the pool in the first place? I suspect this is only partially a result of Segwit.

I agree with everything you've said but you're sticking to the issue of valuation. What I was referring to is your point that less money than the full market cap of Bitcoin flew into Bitcoin which is obvious to me because a person always buys a fraction of the market cap and not all BTCs available. It's philosophical but most people are bothered by the fact BTCs mcap can increase by $30b in a day even though only $2b were traded which is what I feel your point was as well.

Agreee fully. The only problem I see with the last crisis is that idiots learned next to nothing.

I beg to differ. For proof of people dumping millions in the hands of thiefs, check out the hundreds of money grab ICOs which scammed people out of their money in the past 12 months. 
Or if you will, who's to blame for the 95% losses of people that "invested" in BS projects?

Economically, what you're saying makes little sense. For example, when a startup comes to investors for funding (think Shark Tank), they ask, say, $1M for 20% of the company which gives it a valuation of $5M. According to you, the business isn't worth $5M because investors only gave $1M. You get my point?

Which protocol and how does it ensure "it"?
@_date: 2018-09-23 11:18:46
So which institutions will ensure this when we have a decentralized, distributed economy?

Simply put, because a malicious node could cheat and submit the block ahead of time, therefore getting the reward. On the other other hand, requiring nodes to solve this crytpographic problem requires them to put in work and ensures new blocks will be mined on average every ten minutes.

Again I agree with everything you've said. Adding to the point, Bitcoin has a certain intrinsic value derived from its ability to store wealth and keeping it out of the government's reach. Anyone rich enough to have been impacted by France's crazy 90% income tax over a million USD of income in 2009 can vouch for that. All I want is to protect my assets so I could continue providing for me and my family.

The only reason why big institutions got to inflate the bubble is because financially illiterate people with shitty jobs got to take on 3 mortgages. The problem aren't the institutions but the idiots of this world. In fact, once the world gets more decentralized, I forecast an increase in the number of bubbles.

LOL populism level over 9000. Since when is having a mortgage a basic human right? The particularly crappy loans even had a name - NINA loans (No Income No Assets). Ugh, those evil bankers playing on our desire to own a home!

Decentralized is not equal to egalitarian. Check it!

Is this the tale of the honest rich countries and the shitty corrupt 3rd world countries? My fav!
