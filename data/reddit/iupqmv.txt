Make backup of wallet.dat before you do anything.
I would do: Help - Debug Window - Console tab.
    dumpprivkey "BitcoinAddress"
And then import it into light wallet like Electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:14:48
Unfortunately transaction ID is not enough - you need wallet.dat, private key, or mnemonic passphrase.

@_date: 2017-12-22 14:27:09
This. When you do your next transaction just send *change* into SegWit address. Moving into SegWit now is too expensive and will not help anyone.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:05:56
You join Lightning Network only once and then you can transact with everyone on the Lightning Network. By design you shouldn't be closing channel all.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:53:53
It is pretty large transaction. Take change output and spend it with $40 fee and hope mempool drops to 100 sat/byte (it did today). If you need it in next block then send with $200 fee.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:38:19


It just means senders software can't process them/isn't compatible. Anyone can send to *bc1* with proper wallet.
*bc1* and some *3* addresses are both SegWit. Transactions from *3* addresses are little larger than *bc1* but advantage is that they are supported everywhere.
You can use both native *bc1* and *3* (with few [extra steps]( SegWit wallets in Electrum.
I am using Electrum SegWit wallet with addresses starting with *3* because I yet to have find service that allows withdrawals into *bc1* address.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:51:29


Quite opposite.


Few days or weeks. Probably will confirm before that.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:26:48
There's already altcoin with that name - it will cause more confusion. So, no.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:21:23
It is normal.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:21
* Wait while it expires and send with sufficient fee.
* Use RBF or CPFP.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:32:56
You do that with your own change output, if you had change output.
Blockchain.info probably has no coin-control features, so you need to send all balance in your wallet back to yourself just as regular transaction with double fee.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:56:10

You can limit bandwidth consumption if it is causing any trouble or you're on the connection with quota.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:43:35
Probably never because fee is about 11 times lower than it needs to be - it will expire and return into your wallet after 3 days or more.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:49:28
You need private key, maybe you have wallet backup somewhere?
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:51:50
400 sat/byte is pretty good fee - should get you trough on weekend, or holidays.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:38:20
Second payment will only confirm when first one is confirmed, if you use first transaction outputs as inputs. That's about all the trouble.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:17:10
Nice, thanks for your contribution then.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:09:30

@_date: 2017-12-07 21:57:40
Fee is high enough for it to be confirmed in weekend or so, if not - you can save transaction and re-broadcast it later, or spend it by sending it back to yourself with very high fee.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:22:07
Trying to game the fee market and decrease average fee? Huh.

It is on the original .org front page, and all other pages.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:46:10
Replace-By-Fee and Child-Pays-For-Parent. Your wallet must have that option, if not just spend change output with very high fee to pay for both - child and parent.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:13:12
Usually there are no deposit fees.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:07:59
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:55:20
It's not even in the mempool anymore, just resend with a sufficient fee.

Mempool is clogged up due to price increase there are many people who want to transact (200k unconfirmed transactions) and that's why low fee transactions might have to wait longer than usual.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:47:42
You can run the node and relay transactions, more nodes - healthier the network. But it doesn't help to clear the backlog.

Not all "3" addresses are SegWit. You will actually reap the fee benefit when you'll be spending from SegWit wallet.

I have only exchange that I don't recommend and that is Poloniex, because they are fixing my withdrawal for 9 months.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:30:30
Way too many similar transactions pouring in - sending without accelerator would be cheaper. I think it's miner doing something.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:33:12
Backlog of low fee, unconfirmed transactions - more people want to transact than system can process.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:08:19
That site is mostly harmless JavaScript crypto miner that many websites (or even malware) include. Bigger question is - if your system and installer legit and not infected with something?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:38:12
Will it help with already fragmented addresses (with many inputs) or you will need to move first to take advantage, like with SegWit?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:44:38
Even with 1000 sat/byte it is nowhere close to 0.01 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:34:04

@_date: 2017-12-08 04:05:47
Yeah, as far as I know his service has pretty good reputation, will he throw it away for 3 BTC? I doubt.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:50:41
There's option in the settings to enable fee editing. If it is not confirmed it will return into your wallet after 3 days or more.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:09:57
I get BTC/USD pair by default.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:17:29
The right thing to do would be to contact QuadrigaCX support ASAP. They might even let you keep those funds as a bug bounty for your honesty.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:00:11
Outputs are several times cheaper than inputs.
For such service to work:
* Inputs must be unfragmented (likely minimum deposit limit, or even deposit fee).
* There must be many users using the system.

You pay once to open (and ideally never close) channel and transact on the LIghtning virtually for free. And even *if* you decide to close - network will be less crowded anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:23:38
Skewed dynamic fee estimation should compensate that to some extent.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:41
You can use both native *bc1* and *3* (with few [extra steps]( SegWit wallets in Electrum.

Because fee estimation is hard and not everyone gets it right.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:49:13
Network will just forget your transaction and it will be like it was never sent.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:05:31
I am consolidating inputs by sending change into bech32 but this format is not useful for receiving - virtually no service supports it. P2SH wrapped SegWit is the only universal way.

It is impossible to hack cold storage. Please tell us more, what OS did you use and how did you sign/broadcast transactions, was laptop internet connected (WiFi?), etc.

If Microsoft (or any other company) never spends, or even deletes its private keys like you say - then it will only increase value of remaining coins. Not threat in any way (rather quite opposite).
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:10:54
Your transaction will be dropped from the mempool, and it will be like it was never even sent. No fee is taken if transaction fails to be included in a block.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:41:19
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:58:54
They should use SegWit and bundle transactions.
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:41:18
Fees are below $0.01 for standard 1 input, 2 outputs SegWit transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:53:21
Standard size SegWit transaction is about $6.25 cheaper than legacy transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:47:10
If it is not worth doing it, then you don't do it.
You might wait for time when fees are lower, and you can afford it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:12:07
SegWit gives you virtual discount, transactions are actually little larger but are counted much less. For example, if someone sends 249 byte transaction it is counted as 168 bytes.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:06:41
Likely just frontend validator, and database address field length.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:22:20

Unless RBF was enabled you can't do anything - there is no change output for CPFP.

+1, it is important to encourage services to support simple thing like withdrawals into bech32.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:20:54
Good for HODL'ers, bad for miner.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:42:55
$1 with current exchange rate is just 36 sat/byte, or 40 sat/byte two weeks ago for standard P2SH SegWit transaction. Those transactions are currently not going trough since fee to be included in the next block is above 700 sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:15:03
Likely senders wallet doesn't support bech32 address format, if you want to use SegWit with compatible format you need P2SH wrapped SegWit addresses that start with 3. You can create them in Electrum with few [extra steps](
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:04:30
It might drop off the mempool after a while (few days or weeks), or might be stuck there forever if someone keeps rebroadcasting transaction. Spend change output with high enough fee to pay for both transactions to get it confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:30:41
Uncheck "Spend confirmed only" checkbox in settings.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:14:07
Because of communication and execution.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:35:42
Do yourself a favor and avoid Poloniex.
I have ticket open for over 9 months about my stuck withdrawal - they just don't care.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:07:48
Miner can recoup 100% by including his own (not broadcasted) transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:07:27
Currently network fee is about $10, but fee situation is changing all the time, so it depends.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:01:39
If you set it too low it will just stay unconfirmed and eventually drop off the mempool ("return to your wallet"). It is better to enable RBF, then you can always increase fee by right clicking on the transaction. As far as I know Electrum enables RBF automatically for transactions with low fees.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:36:17
Parent transaction is always confirmed if child transaction gets confirmation. Send child with high enough fee and they both will confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:28:48
Anyone with wallet that understands new format can send you bitcoins. For compatibility you might want to use [SegWit '3' addresses](

@_date: 2017-12-26 14:35:03


Nodes ensure consensus - your node will ignore invalid blocks, or rules. I see those claims by bigblockers lately that nodes are useless and users must contact miners directly which is shocking because then it will be no better than current banking system.
@_date: 2018-09-02 14:51:19
BTC has SegWit, and it is blocksize increase - blocks can be over 1 MB for a long time.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:06:46
Maybe it will clear on Sunday or upcoming holidays but it is not guaranteed - there's large backlog of unconfirmed transactions that is paying ten times more.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:16:18
There is no way 1 sat/byte will clear in 16 hours when 100 sat/byte transactions are waiting for 4 days. November 20th was the last time when 1 sat/byte cleared.

You can use both native *bc1* and *3* (with few [extra steps]( SegWit wallets in Electrum.
Transaction is SegWit when sending address is SegWit.

It is very low fee and transaction will not be confirmed anytime soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:28:00
Because many people want to transact and are outbidding each other with high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:19:08
There are 85000 transactions in the mempool that paid more than you did. It will likely return to your wallet, and you'll be able to spend it again.

@_date: 2017-12-21 16:16:00
You save on fees when you spend from SegWit address.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:42:35
Well, you shouldn't be storing your coins on exchange in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:31:17


Just spend change output with large enough fee to pay for both transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:02:38
Even with current transaction jam that's exorbitant fee. You should open support ticket.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:38:12

This. SegWit will decrease fee by ~30%.


[Lightning network]( ([newbie friendly]( explanation) is being actively developed.
It can take a while till Lightning Network is fully deployed but then there will be virtually no fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:40:36
Since when GDAX on-chain withdrawals are not free?
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:08:12
For you SegWit is just an address starting with 3 or bc1. And you're using SegWit when you just spend from those addresses. SegWit is backwards compatible with everything (exceptions might be some services that don't yet support withdrawals into bc1 addresses).
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:31:23
No, only specialized hardware can mine at this difficulty level - no GPUs or CPUs, those times are long gone for Bitcoin. I think OP was joking (well, I hope he was).
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:33:53
Long, unconfirmed transaction chains will be rejected by the network. Each transaction currently costs about $20. You will just waste your time, or run out of money.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:02:05
There's *report* link under posts - you click it and it is taken care of.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:31:01


For 2-5% fee minimum transaction (at this time) is at least $400-1000. I hope Lightning comes soon enough for our day-to-day *coffee* transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:36:19
You can go lower than what Electrum suggests, just enable manual fee editing in settings. You get fee discount only when you spend from SegWit address. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:51:14
Network needs full nodes, though. And with open incoming ports - then you're contributing to some extent.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:30:25
They are cheaper approximately 25-30%.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:15:04
Fees are actually going down, currently about $5 from $20 while back. But yeah - I hope Lightning comes soon.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:43:55
There's more than 10k transactions to be cleared until it reaches your range but transactions keep piling up.

Please sign message with your PGP key, or address form early blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:44:07
Your transaction was bundled with other people transactions, so you paid only partial fee.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:37:12
It works great, only there's red error flashing on bottom - at first I thought it didn't work, but it does.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:36:02
Legacy *1* address should be replaced with *3* SegWit. There is no reason to list *1* address at all.
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:26:44
Because users are not forced to use SegWit. 40% is actually very good adoption for optional feature, and blocks on Bitcoin are routinely larger than 1 MB.

Your website is broken. Please check blockchain.info, btc.com or any other upgraded explorer.

Does anyone know if Schnorr signatures will help already existing dust?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:48:18
We should encourage everyone to use SegWit while we are waiting for the Lightning Network to arrive - that will free blocks and add 70% more capacity.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:58:18
You should not include some of the low value inputs, they cost more to transact than they are worth. You will get more bitcoins at the end.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:37:17

Fee is taken in bitcoins, from every transaction.
Even if you send coins to yourself there's a network fee that goes to miners that are securing the network and including your transaction into public ledger.
There is no computing charge for users (well, maybe some - if you run full node), miners do all the hashing and get paid with bitcoins.

@_date: 2018-05-21 00:49:21
Good wallets already do that.

It is very unlikely that both forks will survive and there will be *free money*. My guess it is just mostly pump and hype.

If site is hacked HTTPS will not help. Checking signature will ensure that code is released by developer and not modified. When you first import key you need to check if it is really the correct one and later verifying downloads is very simple thing to do.

Multibit probably lost your change address (failed to save). Happened with many users before. Upgrade to deterministic version.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:48:58
Electrum wallet has an option to choose dynamic or flat BTC/byte fee. I rarely pay more than 10 sat/byte because I don't have many urgent transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-26 18:15:41
It is [literally fake]( and obviously doesn't go trough any controls.
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:00:03
Very interesting feature, till now I used API for that. Suggestion would be to make minimum lower - 0.1 BTC. And it should be possible to edit and delete old auto-invests to not clutter the page.

Is your transaction made from many small inputs, like faucet dispenses?

What about multisig, that could improve security?

There are other coins that are pegged to fiat currencies like BitUSD and Nubits.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:40:48
How do I know if I have SegWit address, and how to get one? Does spending from such address really result in smaller transaction/lower fee? How are they technically different from regular addresses?

Doesn't work if you have transaction with less than 10 sat/byte fee. It is also overloaded and doesn't accept new transactions most of the time.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:27:59
Oh, right? Why do you limit your calculations to only one forked altcoin? You know there are plenty. /s
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:25:23
Maybe because people don't feel dire urge to upgrade. As time goes by, number of Segwit transactions should increase.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:22:22
Use RBF or spend change output with high fee.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:45:32
Electrum is GUI wallet that can do segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:19:19


Yes, unconfirmed transactions can expire.


Yes, theoretically anyone can save your transaction and rebroadcast it after any timespan while inputs are untouched.


No, you can use RBF or CPFP to get it confirmed.


Yes, when it is out of mempool you can resend same coins.
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:33:51
Removal of maximum static fee input field is really unfortunate, now it is locked between 5 and 300 sat/byte. If I want to go out of range, I have to calculate fee myself.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:57:10
Don't trade - you will lose money. Hodling is your safest option.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:03:47

*Instant* and *free*, huh? You may want to change that to *fast* and *cheap*.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:54:47
Fees are decreasing. It depends how much sat/byte you paid, not just fee in fiat.

More important is where you keep your recovery passphrase.

When all bitcoins are mined, miners will mine to receive transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:14:12
Mempool is already competitive - transaction with highest fee gets priority to be included in the next block. I think you are looking into way to *discriminate* - which pool/miner processes your transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:07:06
You could theoretically submit signed transaction into miners website/api so it doesņ't go into public mempool. But I am not aware of any miner that offers such option.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:06:35
Did it air already?

Table instead of list would be better.
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:19:07


Default *relayfee* is 0.00001 BTC/kB, so transactions below 1 sat/byte are not propagated by most of the network.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:01:53


Ethereum has faster decision making because it is much more centralized than Bitcoin is.


So pretty much Bitcoin's Lightning upgrade, that is already alpha-tested on mainnet.

Is there sign up without Twitter planned? Or it is only for tipping on Twitter?
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:32:18
Wallet developers just don't want to listen to users whining that their transactions are not going trough, so they overestimate fees.
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:08:53
There's option to extend seed with custom words.
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:42:02

Just run *getnetworkinfo* in Bitcoin Core console or CLI and look for *relayfee*, you will get 0.00001000 BTC/kB.

Yes, you can import single key in Electrum, and use QR codes to sign transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:22:30
Yes, and only if sites use less than 10% of CPU. But then what happens if all sites use this technique? Maybe better use case is to replace paywalls with POW, to read full article, etc., bar fills and you get access after a while.
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:34:41
Even 1 sat/B.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:42:23


So do sidechains that can have their own blockchain coupled to the Bitcoin blockchain via a two-way peg.


Again sounds like Lightning network which is capable of millions (conservative figure) transactions per second across the network, and will likely be stable before Etherium finishes its own.
I am not dissing Etherium - it did unique things in the past and might do in the future. But I am more excited about technological advancements on the Bitcoin network at this point.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:24:41
You are supposed to use hardware wallets, or sign transactions offline. Less popular OS can only reduce attack surface.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:38:02
Because default Bitcoin network limit for transaction to be propagated is 1 sat/byte.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:42:18
Only thing that you will get trading altcoins is ulcer and less bitcoins than you started with.

I suggest making backups and writing down seed before upgrade (what you should do anyway).
After few actions and sent transactions and statups it complained about wallet not existing (was left with unencrypted .tmp file)
Restore from seed is not working at all, after submitting seed it say:
    OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/user/.electrum/wallets/default_wallet'
Tried on 2 different systems, didn't work. Had to downgrade to previous version - 2.0.4 that works fine.

You can adjust prediction levels on bottom of the page: optimistic, standard or cautious. It takes into account velocity of transactions entering the mempool that's why it seems like overestimation. Imagine if block comes after 30 minutes mempool will look way different from how it looks now.
