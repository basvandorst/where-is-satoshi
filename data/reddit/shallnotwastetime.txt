The key is to keep sensitive/private data separate. A Linux computer (or dual boot or linux-boot from USB) solely for bitcoin and online banking is a good step.
A different user account (on Windows or Linux) for bitcoin business that isn't used for anything else, is also a good start. Even better if you encrypt the home directory (or equivalent on Windows.)
The biggest thread to computer security nowadays are browsers and everything connecting to the internet. I know no one who does this, but a separate user account or (virtual) machine for all things internet (except for bitcoin and banking) would help a great deal.

Well, 10% sounds low, but it could be more than sufficient. How many people have the whole DNS database? Probably no one. How many backup servers does SWIFT have? Maybe ten.
Relative numbers don't matter. As long as there is a large enough absolute number of reliable nodes, what can go wrong. The blockchain is available.
Maybe it would help if a number of big players keep the blockchain available via HTTP, Torrent or a well-known super node, so that we know where to look for the full chain.

Gold is a commodity, but it fits -- sort of.
How would you know what your gold is worth without fiat? Sure, you could say that you can exchange this Gold bar for a car here or a mammoth there, but fiat is more practical.
Even Gold bugs pay their groceries with fiat. There is a huge fiat economy that produces nice things you can buy with gold (indirectly). This stuff wouldn't exist without fiat (or at least, we don't whether people would invest their gold to build factories in a fiat-less world).

I'm not sure that's effective. Charities ask for your time and money and they try to acquire it with as little effort (overhead) as possible. Accepting bitcoin means extra effort, and I don't think we have a compelling reason, why this should pay off. (Also, charities get a lot of bad press if they seem to speculate with donation money, take part in experiments, or otherwise risk spending donated funds in a manner not aligned with their mission statement. And, the press is largely ignorant about Bitcoin.)
If we want charities to accept bitcoin, we have to donate some of our time and set up something actually useful. Maybe:
* Pick one charity at a time.
* Set up a website for a particular cause: If we raise 1000 BTC, we can help build a school.
* Attract people to donate. Maybe sell something for as-many-bitcoin-as-you-want like the humble bundles
* Forward the money to the charity and don't ask for anything in exchange. It's a donation. Not a hidden payment for advertising bitcoin.
Now, if you get the charities somehow involved in the process and if the donation drive is somewhat successful, they will want a bitcoin address on their homepage and the message will spread.
It's more work than writing letter, but, I feel, it could work.

Yes, but these threads either quite old or end with a Wuala employee stating the cmdline interface is not supported.
While, the CLI still available, the commands you list are hardly useful in the current version. Some of them do what would guess they do, but it's unpredictable and undocumented. I failed to setup a simple "login and stat sync/backup" script.


While I believe this works, it's not what I was looking for. I was hoping to run wuala in the background even with no user logged in. The computer in question is a file and media server attached to my TV set with a somewhat clumpsy remote keyboard/mouse, which makes it a bit painful to enter strong passwords. On the other hand, I do not want access to all files needing backup without requiring a password.

I'm not sure, I understand. How would a bank in Panama help? 
Do you expect someone who holds a few coins as an investment and few just in case a place near me starts accepting them to open a bank account in Panama, wire money there and use their exchange to buy BTC?
Or do you rather think that this bank will handle only large-scale Bitcoin-Fiat transactions, a wholesale market for merchants and smaller exchanges?
On the other hand, if you do this in Europe, I'm excited. A bank account that I can send and receive SEPA transfers in my name for free, that's sounds OK. If this bank is only slightly bitcoin-friendly, e.g. cooperates with an exchange, offers escrow for fiat and bitcoin, ..., I'd do it.

Adding to what others have said.
If you have the private key, you can calculate the public key. If you have the public key, you can calculate its hash, the bitcoin address.
When you send bitcoins to some address, you make the coins available to whoever knows the corresponding private key. Now, if this persons wants to send the coins somewhere else, they need to prove, they know the private key, which reveals the public key and allows to check it matches the address.
Practically, the address is used where you would expect the public key and the actual public key is never seen by a user.

I have the following ideas (not a CC merchant) and non is water-tight:
* Ship a physical product (paper wallet). Have them confirm they received it. Delay funding the address long enough. (Does 6 month delay sound like an attractive product?)
* Have a trusted third-party (Amazon) ship a physical product and deal with payments. Also have insurance for the case that the product is lost or damaged in transit. (Expensive!)
* Make sure you can proof in court that they owe you USD for products shipped or services rendered. Send an invoice and accept CCs along with other forms of payment. To be paid in 30 days. (Are you willing to do this?)
* Find out how ATMs or "CC cash advance" work, i.e. be a bank.
* Work with paypal (good luck!) and only accept seasoned/trusted funds (good luck, again).
* Work with local business owners, so customers can show up in person and provide ID, sign paperwork, ... (Attractive product?)

With Bitcoins you don't need more significant digits than with any other currency. US$ 25 buys 0.23 BTC or 23 bitcent (hardly used) or approximately 230 mBTC (milli bitcoin or millibit).
Rule of thumb: The bitcoin rate has hovered aorund the 100$ mark for a long time. This can change, but for a rough estimate, just translate US dollars as bitcent:
    $ 100 =~ 1.00 BTC = 1000 mBTC
    $  10 =~ 0.10 BTC =  100 mBTC
    $   1 =~ 0.01 BTC =   10 mBTC

This is the clearest English language article so far. However, I think they are wrong on the "keep-less-than-one-year" part.

this has to do with the fact that we understand physical security better than computer security.
paper wallet stolen: It's gone
house burns down: Paper wallet is gone.
It is relatively easy physically to break into a house. A paper wallet is not ultra-secure. But, we know and understand the risks.
Also there are social and legal rules in place, which are more or less respected and enforced. A guest in your house wouldn't try to open your safety deposit box, even if he could without being caught. This is not true for software.

This is certainly interesting. Their business plan works if and only if, they can efficiently exchange bitcoins for fiat on both sides. They have to account for twice the fee the exchange charges, the spread between ask and bid, the spread between different exchanges, the fiat banking fees and their own operational costs. 3% sounds very ambitious.
However, if they can get some of their customers to use bitcoins (on one side of the transactor) or buy/sell bitcoins from geeks as a side business, this could be very interesting: Tech-savy expat sends bitcoins to a bitcoin adresss. Grandma picks up local fiat at a branch next door.

Is there a reason why BTC-ATMs (Get BTC for cash) and regular ATMs (Get cash using a debit card) cannot be combined in a single machine?
One obvious reason, of course, is that no bank would let you run software requiring interact access on _their_ ATM. However, I'd would be great to get 100 USD and 1 BTC with a single debit card transaction.

Makes it easier to double spend.
2. Sender does the blockchain thing on their computer: Sends bitcoin via "my wallet".
3. Other party sees incomming funds on blockchain on their trusted computer immediately. Walks away.
4. Later, he'll learn about a double-spent attack.
What happened? The sender has a copy of his private key on his notebook. Seconds before sending the coins via blockchain, he has already sent them to himself from his local wallet, which is connected to the network, but not directly connects to blockchain.info.
(This can fail because blockchain is well-connected, but it could work.)

This would require a social consensus to consider stolen coins worthless. Not going to happen. Certainly not going to happen instantly.

@_date: 2013-10-24 15:24:11
I get your point, but I'm not sure whether I'm buying the story.
Assume, we have a significant amount of goxbucks and BTC on mtGox as well as USD on bitstamp. The USD rate on MtGox is 220$, on bitstamp it's 200$.
Now, it looks promising to sell BTC on gox (as much as possible) and buy BTC on bitstamp. I can send BTC from bitstamp to gox (as much as I want, relatively fast), so I'm mainly limited buy the amount of USD I can get into bitstamp.
At some point, I want to get USD out of gox and back to bitstamp (to buy even more BTC). This will take months. Why should I adjust the price I'm willing to pay on bitstamp within seconds? I feel that the different timescales don't really make sense. If a full round trip takes mouth why buy at the peak within seconds. (Why not speculate that the bitstamp rate goes down? We are already speculating whether gox survices the next few weeks.)

1. Get a professional web site, not a full screen background image.
2. For small amounts (~ 10mBTC), make them ultra-thin (like paper), so I can keep many of them next to my fiat bills.

Yes, but this doesn't stop kidnapping. Even if the victim does not hold any BTC and the kidnapper cashes out immediately, it only takes four steps:
1. exchange, real name used, buy BTC
2. send through mixing service to kidnapper address
3. send through mixing service again by the kidnapper 
4. exchange, real name used, sell BTC
The only link is the timing and the amount in BTC. If its a relatively small amount, practically untraceable. For larger sums, they will take better precautions or get caught (but after the kidnapping has already happened)

OK. In principle, I'm looking for something like the weighted average and daily high/low. However, not calculated from mtgox data, but according to some community consensus (say across all exchanges that publish such data).
The keywords here are 'consensus' and 'daily'. If a news reporter calls me and asks what today's bitcoin rate is, what do I tell them? If they call you five minutes later, would they get the same number? (We cannot decide what the 'correct' rate is, the market does this and mtgox reports it, but we can agree on how to present, interpret or talk about the data.)


Yes, and the ECB publishes a reference USD rate. Daily. Not once per second. This helps practically even though it's less accurate.

Interesting, but difficult to grasp from an end-user perspective:
1. I start with "real" fiat money (say USD cash). First, I have to acquire BTC and store them in some wallet. (And, Bridgewater does not help here.)
2. Then, I'll send these BTC to my Bridgewater address. Now, I have virtual USD in my Bridgewater account, which I can spend using the Bridgewater wallet, which is different from the wallet I used in the first place.
3. Now, I can spend and earn these virtual USD using Bitcoin and the Bridgewater wallet, paying a fee to Bridgewater.
4. Finally, I can withdraw my virtual USD by reversing step 1, i.e. sending BTC somewhere to buy USD cash.
Also, the fees for a full roundtrip are higher, since steps 1 and 4 incur an additional fee.
I still like the idea. Just consider allowing for wire transfers in/out.

I have once successfully requested a chargeback against an ATM operator. I was travelling to the UK and the stupid ATM at the airport refused to charge my card in GBP, but insisted on using EUR without displaying the rate or any fees. (However, I confirmed that they charge the EUR equivalent.) Then, on the receipt, they claimed that I had agreed upon a 10% service fee. I told my bank and the fee disappeared quickly. No idea, what happened behind the scene. (It's possible that my bank took the loss, since they advertise "free" use of ATMs (as in no hidden costs).)

Actually, there are only 4 billion IPv4 address. They were (mostly) bought by early adaptors in bulk and can be shared/sub-divided and resold. How much is a /16 network? I have no idea.
Similar for domain names and email addresses. While they are unlimited technically, the good ones are worth something now. (And it's not the tech-savy early adoptors who own most of them.)


I get your point. You could have invested in Google stock (or cisco or whatever), which from todays POV looks like an investment in the "internet". However, this wasn't obvious, then. (Netscape?)

You have to understand the risks that come with each option. Here, you're biggest risk is your own computer and browser. If this is compromised, it renders all security useless. There could be a trojan sitting silently somewhere, and as soon as you try to move your coins, it will redirect the coins to his address. TFA, strong passwords are irrelevant because you will provide them.
Also, blockchain.info is well-known and, thus, a target thieves will specialized on.
The verdict: If you use your blockchain wallet exactly twice: Once to create the address (deposit) and once to send the coins elsewhere (withdraw), this sound reasonably safe. If you log into blokchain regularly (from a normal, thus unsafe, computer), your coins are at risk.

This will happen again and again. Anyone accepting Bitcoin, who actually needs fiat, will just sell at the current market rate; just like you do with foreign fiat. Yes, due the relatively small volume of BTC, they are taking a loss, but they have other things on their mind. They are running a business, not trading currencies. Also, they are probably charging a premium from whoever their customers are to cover such losses.
With more businesses accepting bitcoin through third-parties (like bitpay, coinbase, ...), we will see this more often. The third-party does care at which rate they trade. However, their contract requires them to wire fiat at the end of the day/week/month.

If someone has invested 1% of their wealth in BTC, now this amounts to 50% (or so, depending on time of purchase.) That's an awful lot of money, which should hedged/diversified.
This creates the realistic risk for other investors that the rate may go down, giving them an incentive to sell as well, even if *all* parties *believe* in Bitcoin.
This can cause a 'crash' or correction depending the demand. No one really knows who's buying all those bitcoins. ('The Chinese' is not an acceptable answer.)
Next weeks will be volatile. Maybe I'll buy, maybe I'll sell, probably at the wrong time. (Don't worry, all I have is pocket money, it won't move the markets.)

I understand, it's tempting to wonder how the events that happen in the world could influence our hobby, bitcoin, but this comes across as super egocentric.
People in turkey have other things to worry about. Whatever happens now, no one can predict how bitcoin could help. (Say, bank accounts are frozen or inflation goes up in Turkey. You might say, Turks could protect themselves by buying BTC. However, what if at the same time, the gov't decides to censor the internet, disable cellphone networks. What would the bitcoins be good for in this scenario. Also, it's hard to care about the long run, if you are fleeing from tear gas and police tanks.)
Buying bitcoins is risky, especially if you're unexperienced. Turks don't need more risks.

Well, in attractive areas (downtown, better shopping malls), space is scarce and if such hybrid machine machines exist, you can offer bitcoin without the need for additional space.
Also, it makes sense technologically. ATM do already have bill dispensers, some accept cash deposits. They do have computer and network equipment and are designed with security in mind (both physically and IT wise).
It's not straight forward because you have to play nice with banks and their idea of security, but it could work. In some countries, ATMs sell cellphone credit/minutes or airport fees. Why not bitcoin?

Actually, for blockchain.info or strongcoin (I believe), the idea is, they can't runaway. The keys on the server are encrypted and all the magic is done client-side with Javascript.

That's actually a good question. Yes it does help, but it depends on how you use them.
The idea is that any transaction has two recipients. One address is owned by yourself, your change address. The other one is owned by the other party, the actual recipient. After some transactions, it becomes pretty difficult to guess, which address is yours.
Assume you have 5 BTC, you sent 1 BTC to myself and 4 BTC to your change address 1AAA. Now, me and you know that 1AAA is your address, but no one else does. Then, assume the next transaction will send 2 BTC to 1BBB and 1CCC each. Now, I can guess that you control either 1BBB or 1CCC, but I cannot know for sure.

I guess, this happens when you hand-craft a transaction.
None of the wallets, I have used, are prone to accidental fees. The logic how fees are calculated and whether it needs user interaction to include a fee differ.

A very good question. And the answer is yes. It's a property of elliptic curves (EC), the underlying mathematically problem used with Bitcoin's crypto. Here's the idea as I understand it: (I don't really understand the math, just paraphrasing what I read)
* You have two private keys K1, K2. Of course, you can generate a third private key K3 = K1 + K2.
* For each key, you can calculate the public address P1 = f(K1).
* The interesting property is the following: If you know the public keys P1 and P2, you can calculate P3 without knowledge of K1, K2 or K3
* Deterministic wallets work with a random K1 and many deterministic K2s. Publishing P1 and a rule to generate the P2s gives a deterministic watch-only wallet.

Well, there will probably be a tag "LaoPanthera" on blockchain.info connecting any purchase ever made to your name. Your real-life friends can find out who you are on reddit (through bitcointip). Also, by sending your coworker/employer 5mBTC for a coffee once, they learn you've been donating to wikileaks once (no matter of the time order of both events). Also, everyone you ever interacted with knows where you live, where and when you eat out, and so on.
On the small scale, it doesn't matter that much. Say, you buy 1 BTC, store and your phone and use this address until you run of bitcoin. No, big deal. But, a single address for your whole life? Questionable.

     1 BTC = 100 EUR +- 10 EUR       (H: 125 EUR, L: 87 EUR)

First, you misunderstood me. I assumed that the vendor would lock the price in. Hence, I buy 1BTC now, pay 100EUR at current exchange rate. And, then get 1BTC 6 weeks later (no matter where the market goes).
And, then, it depends. This scheme won't replace exchanges, but it could work for some people. If you want the PW as a gift or long-term investment, 6 weeks aren't an issue.
Casascius coins make great gifts. I bought some 2 years ago (for christmas) and I don't think any of the coins were spent. As long as I can trust Casasicus not to run with my money, I don't really care when exactly he funds them.

The "Buyer Provided Camera" is secure for the customer. This is how Bitcoin was designed to be used. And, bitcoin expert will expect this method.
However, it may not always be practical. Maybe the customer has no smart phone (or doesn't trust it enough to handle money). Maybe the customer does not have mobile internet access (e.g. foreign cellular contract or bad 3G service in the area).
The "Cashier Provided Camera" is a good alternative and works with paper wallets. If the private key doesn't hold much more coins than needed in the transaction, the risk is acceptable. Consider sending the change to a new address provided by the customer or printed by the POS terminal. If I pay cash, I also trust the merchant not to run away with my 100EUR bill.

I agree with this point. They probably appreciate at. Send them a nice thank you note for accepting bitcoin at a rate favourable for the customer with some explanation.
Consider that anything bitcoin-related is experimental and maybe a 10% fee or risk doesn't look so bad for experimental technology. (At least they get 90%, while with other payment methods they may not get anything in the end.)

There are no market fundamentals to support short term price fluctuations. It's the free market, combined with technical shortcomings in trading process and relatively small volumes being traded.
If you want to sell bitcoin, because you need a dollar, you have to sell at the price someone at that very moment (using the same exchange) wants to buy at exactly this price. If you need that dollar badly, but people are hesitant to buy (or cannot get their account verified or their fiat wired), you have to sell at any price. Here's your dip.
And, there's psychology. Oh now, bitcoins are crashing. I'd better sell, too.

Ouch! I used to believe this capital control thing was just for some days. Cracy. You are in the EU and you cannot wire money across the border. Can you travel and use your debit/credit card abroad?
Consider selling stuff for bitcoin or buying physical bitcoins (Casasicus are most popular) with a credit card. The premium you pay for the physical coin +shipment maybe acceptable since those are collectable coins you can hope to sell later at ebay with a comparable premium.
Some people are willing to sell bitcoin for Liberty Reserve vouchers (e.g. on bitcoin.de) or even paypal via bitcoin-otc or ebay (disguised as a physical product). Risky and/or expensive, but you may want to try.

That's not silly. Sure, there are case where time matters. Say I want to buy something and the vendor ships only after receiving my payment in bitcoins, instant buy is gold. (Also, technically I can get more interest on my fiat when delaying the bitcoin purchase as long as possilbe).

Your bank will ask questions and become suspicious. It's not that there is a customer-facing charge back button. You'd have to:
1. Log into your online banking. Initiate the transfer.
2. Do your thing on Mt. Gox/LB, etc.
3. Call your bank. notify them, that some EUR disappeared from your account. Claim, you have no idea what Mt. Gox is, and certainly you have nothing to do with this SEPA transaction. Also, your computer is secure and you have no idea, how this could have happened.
If you are a customer in good standing this will work once. The second transfer to Mt. Gox will raise a red flag. Also, the bank has your IP address. Mt. Gox/LB has your IP address. The bank may or may not get law enforcement involved.

I agree with your reasoning and sentiment. However, I still kind of like the idea of a community-trusted vendors making reasonable safe paper wallets (e.g. casascius coin). We trust people every day with stuff that's worth up to, say, 1 BTC.
I guess, in the long run we should figure out a convenient two-factor system (via EC magic, bitcoin multisig, SSSS, or something else):
1. Buyer thinks of a password (can be relatively weak, low entropy), and writes it down. Doesn't tell anyone.
2. Buyer calculates private key (hash(password)) and public key (EC crypto, e.g. via Javascriopt on some trusted website) and sends the public key to the paper wallet vendor.
3. Vendor generates another (strong, high entropy, truly random) private key; prints on paper wallet.
4. Vendor funds an address that requires both private keys to spend the coins.
Now, while the paper wallet vendor could, in principle, keep a copy of the private key, this would be worthless without the customer's password. Still, as long as the vendor is honest, this paper wallet is stronger than a brain wallet, and it's secure against most malware on the customer's computer.

Yes, this will work. However, it discloses the private key in a number of places:
* The sticker is gone, so it's clearly readable on the card
* It goes through your computer and your browser
* And Blockchain gets a (potentially weekly) encrypted copy of the key.
* (Bit-card has the key already)
Do this a number of times (maybe with different computers) and your private key practically becomes public knowledge. If your Bitcoin disappear, you'll have no clue who stole them.
Better send the change to a new card.

It's not that easy. This could work once, but if you try and repeat, the vendor and your bank will soon terminate their relationship with you for fraud. Not worth the hassle.
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:42:02
I agree, in principle. If you have other options (e.g. a credit card), spending BTC is not attractive, especially since they are difficult to acquire.
However, at some point, people want to cash out or spend. Also, not everyone likes disclosing CC numbers or working with paypal.

In Europe (SEPA), this takes 2*3 days maximum (by law), and typically incurs no fees besides what the exchange charges.
Of course, your concern remains valid: 1 week delay + some fess -&gt; risky business.

Oh fuck, I see a crash coming... Too many people rely on Gox and go crazy if they fuck up.

YES. This is exactly what  does! It's popular and has a good reputation.

Honestly, we all know that there will be a correction/crash. The faster the price rises, the sooner the corrections.
We don't know when.
Invest only what you can avoid to loose.

It may depend on the type of company. A brick and mortar store that does all business offline, maybe, doesn't need a (boring, but time-consuming) web site. Something interactive like Facebook may work better for them.
However, this is an online business. If they don't have a website, they don't exist, even if the website merely states their postal address and TOS. You just need to post something to be somewhat credible.

Well, the risk is that it makes Bitcoin look bad if the recipient cannot redeem his coins.
@_date: 2013-08-11 13:44:47
This looks like a major problem indeed. Is this a flaw in ECDSA? In the bitcoin-world, creating new private keys on the fly is possible and encouraged, but generally, one should expect a private key to be used multiple times...

I have a bitcoin-specific user account on my (online) linux machine, encrypted home; plus encryted online backup, not-so-long password. I figure the risk of loosing the private keys is larger than the risk of someone cracking multiple layers of (potentially weak) security.
Still, I'm nervous. But not nervous enough to go completely offline.

That's a nice move towards the bitcoin community and will help
* those who already have/use a Flattr account and want an alternative funding method, or
* those who want a Flattr account, but cannot fund via traditional means.
However, these groups are probably tiny. If you want to be disruptive, accept bitcoin from third-parties who don't have a flattr account:
1. Add a small bitcoin logo to the flattr button. 
2. Present a bitcoin address when clicked. Accept bitcoin "donations" from any site visitor.
3. At the end of the day/month, collect all such anonymous bitcoin donations, convert to EUR, fund a special 'bitcoin' account on flattr and distribute as if the pages receiving the donations would have been flattred by this 'bitcoin' user.
This would attract users not (yet) interested in the flattr system and increase the wealth being spread through flattr.

Well, this only confirms they have a block list and enforce it in so-called 'private groups'.
What did you expect?
Also, private does not mean private; private means targeted to a specific audience, the group, but it's still on facebook.

I suggest, you should take at least a 19" monitor, 2 BluRay drives, 12TB SSD, Windows 9 and IntelliSomething.

Do your research. This is well-document. You can print yourself a paper wallet (as offline as it gets) in five minutes (including the tin foil stuff).

Find your identifier or a backup. You do have backup, right?
Potentially, you can find your identifier from your browsing history. Or your email (unless the adress you gave them was wrong).
Knowing the public address is useless. Blockchain does store your keys or addresses in clear text, they don't know. (Maybe they can figure it out from logs, but I doubt they'll help). You should have provided a good email address and make a backup. They told you.

I never understood why a scanned utility bill is suitable to prove one's ID. Couldn't everyone come up with a document that looks like a (foreign) utility bill in latin letters?
Sure, in real life, if you have a bill from a well-known local company, that immediately looks legit, but online across continents... WTF?
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:50:53


I believe this is a solved problem. The whole transaction is only valid if all parties sign. If one person doesn't, no coins will be moved around. (That's what I figure from reading the docs for the new blockchain.info mixing service that appears to work in a similar manner)
@_date: 2013-05-01 17:03:00

This. Probably OP send .014 BTC to himself, meaning the net effect is 0.00 if sent without a fee.
If you are using blockchain.info wallet, be aware that such transactions (including any transaction that makes use of a change address) often look mysterious in their UI. However, there's (usually) nothing wrong behind the hood.

OP's description is not clear, but let him bring it on. We'll see. A bitcoin address is a username. Seller can prove by signing a message that he owns the address. So, it's possible.

You can't blame Coinbase for phishing mails.

I believe, it is an estimate for the 'real economic' cost per transaction, not just the fees. Thus, you can read this value as:
* all fees plus block reward (25BTC) / number of transactions per block; or
* total cost spend on mining (hardware, electricity, ...) / number of transactions
