it can stop inflating, but after the money is printed and confidence is lost, it cannot just simply increase drastically back to its old value

Yeah my first though immediately was , "hmm yet your prices are pegged and shown only in dollars? how hypocritical" edit: and yes, I am aware and sympathetic to the reality that your expenses are based on dealing with companies that only accept fiat and so it's unrealistic , but still, the emphasis on being crypto only but displaying prices only in dollars is a major downfall in my opinion and is something you could work on
