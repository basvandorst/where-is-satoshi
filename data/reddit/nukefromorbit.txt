Most of the things you said was correct. But it's not a Ponzi scheme since someone has to get out for others to come in. In a Ponzi scheme people can buy in without anyone leaving, and when there are no more buyers it will inevitably collapse. In a market, a seller can become a buyer again so a collapse is not inevitable. It can be possible or likely or very likely but it's not forced like in a Ponzi scheme.

My fiat holdings have lost 95% of it's value in 12 months. Against BTC.
Everyone's fiat holdings has, including yours.

I like the idea. If you do this you miss out automatically on getting more btc in the dips and less on the peaks, though. Dunno what's better.

You could say btc has gone up 20x against fiat in 12 months. You can also say fiat has lost 95% against btc in 12 months.

Feeding hatred into the community doesn't help. I'm happy holding btc and not bch, but I also recognize how much damage it does when the we can't discuss our problems openly because we need to look strong vs the other side.

It's easy to end up flip flopping between hoping for and dreading a beastly dip :)

Yes, definitely that's the lesson here.

He sold off half of it a few times over to get to 300btc. Each time a small fortune. He's well off now.
You are too with 8btc. Will be better and better over time. Congrats!

Thanks! 
For a completely different story. The friend that made me buy $40 worth of btc in 2011, himself GPU-mined 6000BTC same year. His philosophy has been to sell off half of it to fiat whenever the value is double of what a normal person ever needs. That's brought him to have something like 300BTC left which he'll hodl rather than keep shaving off.
Perspectives like these are good lessons in hindsight being 20/20 for all of us.

High volatility is required for the meteoric rise of crypto. It's not (only) a measure of how much the value is going down, it's also a measure of how much it's going up.
