Of course they are reluctant, this is why I asked the question in the first place.
Country-wide this has gained plenty of recognition from what I've gathered, this is unfortunately not enough for now.
I'm curious if there is a precedent where such a problem has gathered e-fame in the past, so to speak, and what would convince the average internet user/bitcoin owner that this is indeed legitimate (when you are desperate you wouldn't find someone's request for spoon pics humiliating for example so this is doable ...)
Finding such a registered organization (preferrably online and reputable) was indeed what I'm trying to do by asking reddit for help.
I can't know for certain that an organization is legitimate just by looking at their site, and given how easy it is to game google I'm pretty sure that the first pages of all related searches are filled with scammers. Hence I'm looking for reviews in a message board.
P.S. Finally, I have nothing to do with the charity itself and won't be asking for anything (or even mentioning the charity here). What I need is information for now, not deserved downvotes for begging

And Greece still accepted it.
Because a return to the drachma would have been more disasterous - even though it's their call how many of those to print.
If you wanna play, you gotta pay the price...
We should focus on bitcoin's actual advantages for this day and age, not live in utopias or spew bullshit. Change isn't gonna happen suddenly or overnight, this is not how the world works.
And there was nothing wrong in the agreement if Greece still wanted to go through with it.

Looks google-translated in Bulgarian. Mostly gibberish, unfortunately...
