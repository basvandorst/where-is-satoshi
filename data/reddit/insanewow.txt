With all the talk about the big 5000$ mark it will be one hell of a resistance level if we ever get that far.

Well I live in germany and most people still pay in cash and if you want to use something like Apple Pay people look at you like you are from a different planet. I think that is very different in a lot of asian countries so people are way more open to "digital cash" or rather cryptocurrencies.

I think it's a bit of a double edged sword, although I personally know people that dont feel comfortable spending like 1000$ to own just a "fraction of a bitcoin" I think it goes both ways. 3$ per mBTC sounds like a cheap price when you buy them so it could bring in new people that were afraid of the big numbers (and trust me these people do exist) but it also gets rid of the headlines like "Bitcoin crosses 10.000$ mark" because the mainstream might stop looking at it that way. Who knows what is really best for BTC in the long run.

I hope we dont live in the timeline where Bitcoin starts WW3.

I like  personally. If you dont want to go through the entire verification process you can use something like  but be aware that they have recently given out user information to the police.

I think we just have to look at gold for an answer, does it go up during economic collapse ?

I kind of agree with you but I dont know how much this hardfork has really hurt BTC so far, honestly BTC hasnt really crashed because of it it has barely lost anything. We were talking for days now that we expect a correction because it was gaining too much too fast and a 10% dip just seems like a natural correction rather than a crash because of the hardfork especially with it recovering almost half of it as I write this.
There arent really any signs that these two coins cant coexist, if the miners only went for the most profitable chain they wouldnt have been in BTC for a while because their are alts out there more profitable to mine. And BCC just seems like they have a different vision and I can respect that and I can understand why they would keep the name and try to create a bit of confusion in the beginning because it benefits them to some degree but I think even they know the market is tied to BTC and trying to sabotage or change that could lead to a total desaster. I think they should just do their own thing and after a few months when everything has cooled down do a rebranding as to not confuse newcomers to the crypto world. But that is just my prefered vision of the future. I think both coins have a place and I dont think there is anything to gain for both parties if they try to actively sabotage the other. Just coexist and go forward, in the end it isnt about the individual coin but about the entire ecosystem and as long as that is stable and grows we will be fine. I really hope people are smart enough to not go for this infighting when there is a bigger goal we all want to reach which is mass adoption.

We are gonna crash our currency and Mexico is gonna pay for it.

Oh how often I have heard that argument, and when you tell them they can just buy fractions they never seem satisified because then they "wont own even a single bitcoin".

Being afraid of losing money is a bad sign if you want to go in a volatile market such as cryptocurrencies. For all we know BTC could drop to only 50% of its current value, it's not like that hasnt happened before. So think about what you would do in such a scenario because panic selling is gonna lose you money. If you dont need the money for the next 2-5 years then I would say go for it. But dont invest something you arent willing to lose or that would seriously hurt you because I guarantee you if you do that you will panic sell at some point and thats how you lose.

this sounds like some tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. but I hope you are right and the big investors get involved soon, that can only be good for BTC right ?

I can just see Randy freaking out when BTC crashes or throwing around money when it's mooning. The episode practically writes itself.
Also this HAS to be in it:

I currently have my BTC on blockchain.info, Can I leave it there and still receive BCC ?
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:12:22
Seriously though I only bought bitcoins like 1-2 weeks ago and I already feel like years have gone by with all the news, drama, speculation and price swings.
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:05:53
I am new to this whole thing and was told this site is good. why cant I trust them ? and what are my alternatives here ?
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:08:11
Honestly I would expect BTC to drop on Aug 1st and then rise in the days after. Atleast I am expecting an initial drop and hoping to get some cheap coins.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:02:40
So is there any official wallet/website or anything that can tell me how I am getting my free BCC as a BTC holder ? Honestly this whole thing just seems very unprofessional and nobody was able to answer me how exactly I am gonna receive the BCC. Will they just appear in my Electrum wallet or how is that whole thing gonna go down ?
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:46:59
Which exchanges will even support BCC ? Can I sell it on Kraken ? Also is there any information as to how I can actually get BCC ? I am using the Electrum wallet and have no idea how the whole free BCC thing will work out.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:35:54
So what will the initial price of BCC be at ? It wont start at 2000$ like BTC is right ? Because who would buy BCC at that price...
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:59:50
why would people buy bitcoins if they dont know about these things ? seems like a foolish move to me, I would expect the majority of bitcoin holders to know about these things. but maybe I am just expecting too much from the average person here...
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:52:37
So does this mean if I have my BTC in Electrum I wont be getting BCC since they dont seem to want to support it ?
