LN is a myth, I mean it's a Layer-2, I mean it's a Layer-3 solution that is, umm, 18 months away?

wut?  Using bitcoin for crime is illegal.  It's not bitcoin itself that's illegal, but the activity related to it.

I was asking OP, thanks.

Bitcoin is finite, but blockchain-backed cryptocurrencies are not.  Bitcoin doesn't have a monopoly here.

Perhaps, but Snicker bars don't have an index that is marked to market like BTC-F will be.  The chance of arbitrage developing between BTC and BTC-F is far from a hope, it's basically inevitable, but with potential wrinkles depending on who holds enough underlying.
Taking the spot market(s) in isolation.  You can always have more willing buyers to push the price higher (unlimited supply of buyers), but there's a very limited supply of sellers, because a seller needs to hold the underlying.  Now, consider the futures as well.  Is it possible that the arbitrage scenario where BTC-F is underpriced relative to the underlying opens up the scenario you've described?  If no-one is willing or able to sell (to facilitate the arbitrage opportunity), why would the spot price go down?  The futures will have a daily settlement, which, in this case, would bring the price back up.  BTC and BTC-F will therefore normalize one way or another.  Author of article described more intricacies around the reality of executing on arb opportunities.
Also, what is the reality that insiders (connected to Wall Street, etc.) hold enough actual BTC so as to be "permanent" willing and able sellers on the spot market?  Might be a good chance this is the case.  Wall Street has known about BTC for quite a while and has had the means to become huge hoarders in recent years, months, and weeks.  This is a reasonable assumption (not verified), since CME would likely not be coming on board had this not been coordinated in advance (just a theory).

Sure, but proof is in the pudding my man.
18 months is programmer-speak for "holy shit this is complex, you know, actually designing and implementing a robust, worldwide scale-able off-chain payment solution, and we better give a really far out estimate because we're not even entirely sure how to build such a network from scratch in any reasonable timeframe".
There's a far and wide chasm between the current state of LN (some implementations of LN clients), to a completed, tested, scale-able, merchant-integrated worldwide payment solution.  There are so many considerations surrounding such a mechanism that cannot even be foreseen in advance, thus the first implementation will be very much an experiment.
There's another outcome here that isn't really discussed:  Project failure.  LN could fail spectacularly, either before being released or during the initial experimental runs.  The solution, being off-chain, is controversial after all.  Just the security implications alone are enough to raise a serious red flag to the approach.  I don't care about the "other guy's" on-chain solution, which doesn't solve much, either.
Satoshi isn't even in the picture anymore, for better or worse.  Just pointing out that the innovations that he brought to the table (bitcoin, blockchain) were entirely his, and that he's not involved at all anymore.

Lovely response but nothing to do with your religion.

Seller on a bounce at 10,350
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:55:48
Dude, you're religious.  You're not being objective at all.  You're just entirely defensive of your precious deflationary, decentralized sha-256 protected bitcoin that takes the power of a house for a WEEK to complete:  ONE TRANSACTION.  It's nowhere near ready for general commerce.  Buying drugs and money laundering have been primary use cases, whether you admit it to yourself or not.
And, yes, authorities track criminal activity with BTC.  Percentage-wise it's not even close.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:29:22
Try selling here 10,100 all the way up to 10,300 on Bitstamp now.  Symmetrical wedge likely to be continuation pattern to downside.   Supports below, though.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:57:39
Strat needs more wiggle room.  I'm a seller up to 10,475 on bitstamp in the next hour.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:45:39
Dude, what's your background? What are you offering to the discussion?  You just disagree with the guy, but he's far more knowledgeable than you are about economics, currencies, bubbles, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:44:22
Major thing?  A worldwide scalable payment solution is more than clean code on a single implementation of a daemon.  Beautiful code is a great thing, but is just one piece of the puzzle.
Also, off-chain is arguably a poor design decision, and there are quite likely going to be unforeseen security issues of varying magnitudes as a result.  The original vision of a decentralized trust-less network is being usurped by design here.
Not knocking the efforts at all; I realize how difficult software development is.  Much respect to those involved for building beautiful code, especially using a nice minimalist language such as golang.  Just commenting on the reality, which I addressed in a cousin thread from the grandparent to this comment.

Moon is about PRICE which is against the posting guidelines.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:27:26
Yes, that seems to be his/her conclusion.  It's a theory, and good to have a view contrary to the "wisdom" that the futures will be reliably used to hold the price back.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:22:27
BTC is small compared to the USD, and percentage-wise BTC is used for crime far more, by a huge margin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:24:56
Authorities have developed extensive programs for tracking criminal activity related to BTC, since it is pseudonomyous, and not anonymous.
So, to answer your question:  Law enforcement.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:31:47
More like: Sell 10,300 if we rally here today.
This is on Bitstamp
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:20:18
Your post ultimately is about a price prediction, but cleverly has some other subreddit specific / meme-specific stuff such as S-curve adoption included, all of which is perma-bullish in support of the common interest of the moderators who will profit from bitcoin going up.  Propaganda -&gt; Sentiment -&gt; Buyers -&gt; profits for earlier fools.
Thus you pass the "filter" which should have deleted your post about price predictions.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:20:31
How can you possibly say this with a straight face?
BTC is volatile; it's a speculative high risk investment.  It's not meant for savings.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:43:31
Good job holding a winner.
Now, what if it doesn't get back up above $10k again?  What if it drops below $5k from here?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:45:53
Yes, I understand the technology and read the paper seven years ago.
The social implications matter to many people, perhaps not to you or most people seeking to enrich themselves, though.  Those implications place limits on the sentiment, which is FOMO driven.
A cryptocurrency could fix wealth inequality if designed correctly, by actually leveling the playing field.  Bitcoin doesn't have any such design.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:23:13
So?  The point is that bitcoin, percentage-wise, is used for criminal activity far more than, for instance, USD.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:35:52
If trying to short you could do so up to $10,000 Bitstamp here and put a stop above that..
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:46:47
Ok, so what's your solution to this predicament?  Convert the global economy to use "bitcoin" or another "deflationary trust-less" solution and go back to the dark age hoarding economics?  There actually is historical precedent for using "gold" as a currency and it wasn't good for economic growth.
Bitcoin represents a massive technological revolution but not quite a social one, not in reality.  The design behind bitcoin is trustless, facilitating irresponsible centralized miners to hoard even more, enriching the wealthy even more.  This wasn't Satoshi's vision.  It's the first generation implementation of a new tech.  It doesn't fix any wealth inequality issues *at all*, and certainly won't if it were to become the de-facto worldwide reserve currency.  The design enriches early adopters at an absurd level of imbalance, whether per Satoshi's intention or not.
We're at the ass-end of a long-term debt cycle, and it's hard to say how long it'll take to unwind or whether it'll crash before being responsibly unwound.  It'll be painful but there's a way out of it.  Maybe bitcoin will serve as a wake-up call to this reality, a counter-balance of sorts.

Cash has been phased out in recent decades, precisely because it facilitates difficult-to-track criminal activity.
The vast majority of USD transaction volume is legitimate.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:10:05
Ask yourself this: What is the absolute cheapest transaction fee for a $5 purchase?  If it's less than 2% then maybe it's a good strategy.  But this seems unlikely.
