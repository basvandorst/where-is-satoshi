I found the Holy Grail of Bitcoin discussions. Upvote now before you watch because it is a long video. 
Also, reply with any other memorable Bitcoin/cryptocurrency videos that you've found informational or intriguing.

I think that it will be relatively stagnate with the trend being a gradual reduction of price over time until it gets to a lower 1,000's of a level then there will be a massive sell off.

I like the prospect of a decentralized currency that is immune to manipulation and the decisions of major economies. I'm just curious as to how it will play out. I'm specifically focusing on the aspect of goods being valued in Bitcoin as a standalone currency and not in conjunction with the U.S. dollar or whatever fiat currency. 
I suppose eventually you will know that a cheeseburger is worth .xx bitcoin much like you know it's worth $2. I guess people are smart enough to gauge the price of goods in other currencies. I'm from the U.S. so all we use is the US dollar. Perhaps elsewhere people are familiar with the general price of goods in their area with their fiat dollar and if need be they can convert to the U.S. dollar interchangeably. I guess I'm just curious as to when or if things being priced in Bitcoin becomes the main unit of monetary value in people's minds.

I don't see how Bitcoin will have widespread adoption. It isn't userfriendly. Another thing is it doesn't have an appealing unit of account. Can you imagine buying groceries and it costs .0031345 for an apple and you have to think about and pay that amount? That's not taking into account the fluctuation of pricing so what is .0031345 BTC today could be .0043567 BTC tomorrow or vice versa. How will you be able to visualize or understand pricing with a currency that is in decimals and constantly fluctuating? The U.S. dollar fluctuates but it is behind the scenes. The unit of account is still $1 dollar. Your diminishing dollar isn't noticed as much because it is less transparent and subtle as compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin will be used and leveraged in unique cases such as cross border payments where there is already an exchange of currencies and mechanism in place such as currency conversion or foreign exchange so it is business as usual. I don't think it will ever be used for widespread adoption.

Cash/Bank Card maybe mobile phone but doubt it unless it's some group thing.

This mirrors my view so far. When I think about Bitcoin I think about it in terms of it being used in the place of Wire transfers, hiding wealth or getting money out of failing/controlling economies, cross border payments,  and "Anonymous"/gray area payments. 
These use cases are what I currently value Bitcoin in. I'm not one who is so enamored with getting more adoption. If Bitcoin levels out and provides more options for people's needs fine but until then I only think of it in the terms that I mentioned.
