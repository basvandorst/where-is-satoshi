One of my first posts in this sub was in response to a question - "what do you REALLY own when you have bitcoin" or something along those lines. I got voted to 0, and my answer was "privacy." Its certainly getting pricey these days.

I believe that the superiority of bitcoin is apparent in the fact that it is used *first* as a method of payment before being converted to fiat. I don't believe it has a negative impact, but there's an impact there. Hopefully at the end of it all that impact is more apparent.

I would gladly indulge you in proving my identity through the blockchain. Unless you're a State-actor or Government official, this is just smoke in the air to me.

which literature are you specifying, then?

The "lack of" is on a user-basis only.

Can* and is.
@_date: 2015-08-30 03:01:01
absolutely not.

I agree. Well written.

FUD. I highly encourage fellow BTC users to check this out - if you're that "worried" - open it on a VM or analyze the open source code.

This just hits on leading a horse to water etc. - I understand your tinfoil hat approach, here, but seriously...

I'll point out that this was released, discussed, and even demonstrated at the 2600 HOPE conference this weekend. That, alone, and in combination with the fact that it is open source source should empower you with enough knowledge to decide how or whether you should explore this program. You should.

Technical abilities for checking for malware / viruses should be rather inherent with most BTC users. 
EDIT: As well as analyzation of source code or using any software in ways that won't directly infect / exploit your own machines. Interesting to see the downvotes. 
Good luck.

Only trust in yourself, but valid point.

It is entirely dependent on the end-user's ability to utilize coinjoin "correctly" in order to accomplish what you're talking about. What truly breaks it is tumblers and a knowledgeable End User.

Groups transactions in relation to nodes etc... Test it yourself.
