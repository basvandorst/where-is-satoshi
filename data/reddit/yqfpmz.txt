It's NOT two separate characters 山 and 周. It's one single character 㟘.

Withdrawal is relatively easy, funds arrive in your bank account in about two hours.

Well, the character 㟘 doesn't seem to be in actual use anywhere, so maybe the puzzle's solution is just based on its Unicode value or something else unrelated to the character's meaning?

Really it makes no difference to me. I thought my bitcoin-related experiences here in China would be a unique perspective that would be of interest to the r/bitcoin community. Seems that's not the case, so I won't waste my time posting them anymore.

Down from 9 Taobao shops yesterday to 8 Taobao shops now.
Also, BTCChina prices have been consistently higher than Huobi today, and the peaks and troughs in price are flattened out, so you don't get the same opportunities to hit your buy/sell target.
The Huobi prices look much more natural. Their trade interface is also easier and faster to use. Sure wish I had put my money on Huobi!

Look, this is China and sometimes the way things are done here is pretty odd, and hard for us foreigners to understand or believe. I just report my experiences and observations, only the facts. Maybe sometimes an opinion too, like in my opinion Huobi has the better trading platform overall than BTCChina. I still use both of them.
And if r/bitcoin doesn't want to hear first hand about what's really going on here in China, then I might as well stop posting, no point in wasting my time.

No, it's not a card, it's a number sold on Taobao as a virtual product for use with an online "game". You have to enter your ID card number to prove you're 18, as minors are restricted from purchasing gaming virtual products by rule of the Ministry of Culture. Then you fill in your user name in the game, which in this case is your BTCChina login name. Payment is from your bank account, which you can do securely with the USB dongle from your bank, or with your Zhifubao account by scanning a QR code. This payment is kept in escrow by Taobao. After payment the shopkeeper sends you a code via the chat window that you paste into BTCChina to verify a genuine code. Then you go back to Taobao, confirm receipt, Taobao releases the payment to the shopkeeper, and the shopkeeper releases the voucher to be funded to your BTCChina account. The whole process only takes about five minutes, and you can fund any amount, but unfortunately the shopkeeper has to be online at the time.

Ha, I wish. I did find an extra 0.86 CNY in my account afterwards though.

I don't think there are any alternatives for people wishing to buy BTCChina deposit vouchers. They list 9 sellers on their site, all on Taobao. It's a fast and easy deposit method, you can get RMB into your account in minutes by purchasing the voucher from a Taobao seller and redeeming it on the exchange. I much prefer it to Huobi's method where you have to send money to the CEO's account and it might take them 6 hours or more to register the deposit.

They are not separate symbols, they combine to make one character. The 山 radical nearly always goes at the left or on top when it's combined with something else in a character. In this single character 㟘 the 山 is there to provide a meaning hint, and the 周 to provide a pronunciation hint.
You can be sure that this is not two separate characters, because Chinese characters are always written in the space of invisible square boxes, and individual characters' boxes are not allowed to overlap. Also you can see that the 山 has been compressed to fit with the 周 within this invisible square box. Chinese characters always expand to fill their boxes, so there's no way the 山 would be compressed like that if it were a separate character.

Maybe, but will it really make much difference for BTCChina? I don't expect many people will come back to BTCChina after using Huobi. I plan to move my BTC over soon and ditch BTCChina for good. Too many bad experiences with their site. Unless they can improve things down the road.

If this was someone else's deposit incorrectly credited to my account, then maybe that person *is* going to make a 1000btc buy order.

I would think this is good news, since using a business bank account is more legit than the personal one they were using before. Especially since the business bank account has been active for a while, so that makes the change appear to be planned in advance rather than forced.
Also, I just funded a small test amount to their business bank account from my personal account, and the transfer went smoothly, even though I bank with a different bank in a different province.

This is especially bad for BTCChina, because putting money on your account is done by buying a voucher on Taobao (the BTCChina website lists 9 different Taobao vendors to buy from), then redeeming the code on the exchange. This whole process was super fast, you could buy a voucher on Taobao with money from your bank account, redeem it, and be ready to buy bitcoin in less than 5 minutes total. Whereas the Huobi approach of having to deposit money in Lilin's personal account is very slow, taking 6 hours or more for them to manually process your payment.

Currently none of the sites have restricted cash withdrawals to personal bank account.

This news item should not be a warning, it's actually good news that they have fazed out the personal bank account option. And since they had the business bank account funding option ready well in advance, it was likely a planned move.

Huobi has by far the best user experience of any exchange websites I've used, so it's just natural a lot of users will gravitate there, and the free trades do a lot to increase volume as well, because it encourages a lot of daytrading. So I think the volumes there are completely believable.

Nice, finally an opinion from someone who actually understands how things work in China.

Actually the crediting of funds to Huobi accounts is apparently still a manual process, so there's room for human error, especially when they are so understaffed during the holiday. Yesterday my funds transfer took 12 hours for them to process. When I called them to ask when it would go through they told me they were recording them as fast as possible with the limited staff on hand, and it would be processed in the order received. It ended up being credited shortly after 11 pm that night.
