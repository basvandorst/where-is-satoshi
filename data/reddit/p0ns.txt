It's a cool wallet but it doesn't even have the option to import private keys yet.

I can tell from the video that he's really fuckin sorry about what happened. 
He does a reverence in show of respect then he does a big deep breath and lowers it, which kinda signs for a deep apology and also as a show of weakness in front of whoever is watching.
Poor soul

As I understand, it could be possible to attach a scanner to Vx570, not sure if those scanners exist or if it's a doable goal.

I'm aware about Coinkite, but it's the opposite of an opensource platform. Besides buying the machine you have to have a subscription with em that allows you to accept bitcoin. 
The idea here is to have the software open for whomever wants to have it

It's C/C++, on a platform called Verix V. It compiles and signs on top of MSVC++ IDE. If you wanna test the code you may have a VeriFone machine yourself that you may acquire through Ebay. The requirements and the general ideas are stated in the wiki links I posted.

Regarding this, and as they say it was in february, the peak on destroyed days was on February 6. 
It would take some blockchain analysis of that day, and we might be able to find what coins destroyed those days, what are the amounts (they seem to be a lot), where do they come and where did they go. 
Anyone knows a way of analysing that, without making new software for it?

This guy is all about ego. First it must all be like he wants, he threatens to release info after a certain time if actions are not taken as **he wishes**. Then after it all blew back cause' of his stupid tone, he now won't release anything and also **never intended to**. 
It all sounds like bullshit to me. Things shouldn't be driven by some egomaniac person who thinks his ways are the only ways, and can't even be straight with what the actual end was.
