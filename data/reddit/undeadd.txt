Lightning Network protocol specifications 
Rene Pickhardt has a youtube channels with videos going over technical details 
Check out the Lightning Labs blog - particularly the posts by Bryan Vu for some big-picture viewpoints 
Alex Bosworth tweets also worth a look though his musings do not go in depth 
edit: Elizabeth Stark's honeybadger conference presentations are great too. Technical details and 'year in review'.

Multiple lnd nodes can run on the same machine. Just keep separate data directories and configure different ports.
If you’re using the lnd lightning.app (the one with the gui) then those settings are hidden.

The release announcement says to close all channels before upgrading.

I don't know what the error means but it should be fixed 
Next lnd release with this fix should be very soon - v0.5.2-beta-rc3 was released 2 days ago.

I got two channels with TrueVision.club :) If you got time later, maybe we can look at that error message.
I thinkg c-lightning will let you know immediately if it doesn't want to create the second channel. I get this error right away from a node I'm trying to rebalance: "Open Channel Failed: 177:Multiple channels unsupported".

"Note that some RPCs do not yet support segwit addresses. Notably, signmessage/verifymessage doesn’t support segwit addresses, nor does importmulti at this time. Support for segwit in those RPCs will continue to be added in future versions."

Nothing to do with blockchain. It’s about how if you ask for information about all nodes and channels (the describegraph api call), then the response for mainnet is now larger than 4MB. Clients will reject the response but easily fixed by setting a config value larger than the default max response size of 4MB.

I’d love to give it a try, thanks!

describegraph returns enough info to construct the network topography. More info: 
The config option I mentioned is a generic limit applied to all api calls.
