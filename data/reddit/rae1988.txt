Not chartism. Time series analysis. With what confidence interval can you claim "the price will be over $2000 in 6 months"? Is the time series of bitcoin prices even stationary? Does it have a unit root?? Have you checked to make sure the residuals are homoscedastic and lack autocorrelation?

It is a pyramid scheme. It's just a high tech version of Beenie babies.

Do you have any links to real peer reviewed studies?? Not that I care, It's not my money. Faggot

Nah, just bitcoin users and exchange owners have to start donating mad sums of money to congress

Just keep telling yourselves that. I'll watch on with popcorn in hand as the bitcoin community cannibalizes itself

Do you actually use econometrics / time series analysis when you pull these numbers out of your ass?

yeah, no shit. 
maybe don't even hire lobbyists. Just offer to donate directly to Senators / representatives as long as they accept BitCoin donations.
Usually only $1,000 can get a phone call, if its a new representative competing in a primary, etc.

It definitely helps with retention, just by the fact that with Adderall, I can sit in front of what I have to learn for 6 hours straight, vs just farting around on reddit for 3 hours and studying the other 3. 
But I think it's most pronounced if you use it for both studying, and when you have to recall something.
I am impressed though by the papers that I write on Adderall. Like, by the time I get them back from a professor, I've forgotten what I had written, but when I retread the paper, I learn something new.

Pramiracetam is amazing. I remember taking it while I was taking foreign language classes in college, and being able to speak almost fluently.
Oxiracetam was good too, but more subtle. I remember piracetam and aniracetam feeling sort of "dirty". 
Adderall is still my favorite nootropic though.

I'm pretty sure you don't understand how inflation works.

Just like joking about getting robbed in general, but specifically joking about the proliferation of firearms and acting as if the increased violence that would result from said proliferation (as you admit to in saying you'll be robbed by a 3d printed gun), is retarded.
Also, bitcoin in General is a piece of shit currency. It was created by someone who has never taken a macroeconomics course before

I would invest in and start using bitcoins, but I don't want to be associated with paranoid autistics like yourself.

No, asking if fpgas are still sold is akin to asking "are capacitors still sold?"
