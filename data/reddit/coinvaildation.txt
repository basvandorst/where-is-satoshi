Awwe common, if your not a terrorist or child pornographer you have nothing to hide. Now cough up your government issued ID, SIN, 5 utility bills, your landlords ID + 5 of thier utility bills, in addition to the samples of the following: blood, sperm, stoll, hair, and finger prints. Then you should be fine to send money to your friends no problem. At Coinvaildation we strive to make things as convenient as possible.
