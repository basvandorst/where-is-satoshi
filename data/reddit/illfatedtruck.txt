If it was truly that dire of a situation then even more people would be freaking out and bitcoin's price would be much lower.
Those that sell are essentially betting that they are correct in being more scared than the rest of the market. This is where they then trade based on emotion and lose money.
You say you are new to bitcoin.. do you think then that you understand the current coin war more than the old timers enough that you are correct in being more scared than them? If so, you should buy BCH.
Maybe if you buy BCH you will end up in the profitable side. Maybe not. But I'd be careful about making emotional trading decisions.
Personally, I'm just gonna keep hodling.

It could have been implemented as a form in relative harmony with bitcoin, but the way it was created meant that it would be incompatible with the original bitcoin.
Because there was no replay protection, wallets would have difficulty determining if they are receiving 2x coins or regular coins. This would open the door for people's money to get stolen and the two chains would really have trouble coexisting. Understandably bitcoin enthusiasts see this as a dick move.
People forking bitcoin in good faith generally make sure to implement replay protection so that people can keep the two forked coins separate. 
For people to really latch on to an idea and for it to take hold in bitcoin it takes consensus among the different parties involved. 
Nodes can run whatever code/client they want as long as it plays nice with the rest of the network. Miners can mine any coin they want as long as it's profitable enough and they want to.
Buyers/users can use any coin they want, if it's useful or valuable enough to them.
The interplay between these forces is fundamentally why segwit2x was dead on arrival: it did not have consensus.

But... how do you know where the bottom is?
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:04:11
You are right that exponential growth is unsustainable, but that doesn't require the system to collapse.
It's possible that growth will become sub-exponential (polynomial or something) as more and more usage transfers over into second-layer solutions. Then, computing hardware should have no trouble keeping up, since it generally progresses exponentially (albeit much more slowly than bitcoin).
However, the active "growth front" of the technology where we see exponential behavior will still be there, just forced to play out in a different layer of the network, precisely because the underlying blockchain is unscalable.
This is how I understand the argument against block size increases. If the block chain is fundamentally unscalable then we don't want to make changes to the protocol that will reduce the incentive to develop second layer solutions, because we would only be delaying the inevitable, while also chipping away at decentralization.

@_date: 2017-11-11 17:54:04
Yeah what's with all these people that want to sacrifice the long-term potential of bitcoin so they can have their PayPal replacement with cheaper fees RIGHT NOW!
Yeah there are lots of players in the ecosystem but bitcoin is the devs' baby and they want to see it grow up big and strong in the long-term more than anyone.
There are a lot other ways to transfer money around (altcoins, non-crypto solutions), and they might not be perfect be free, but people should use those before complaining about the devs and acting like bitcoin owes them something.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:51:44
Bitcoin cash is dumb populism. 
Developers aren't against a block size increase just because they are big meanies. They are more interested in the long-term success of bitcoin than probably anyone and have well-thought-out reasons for what they do. 
It's not surprising to me that a lot of people don't understand the technical details and underlying concepts, and subsequently don't believe the developers.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:09:57
But we can predict using statistical modeling... and the answer is simply buy now if you believe bitcoin will increase in value long-term, and don't buy at all if you believe it won't.

I'm into bitcoin now because I first downloaded Core in 2010 and read all about blockchain technology back then. It seemed pretty radical (coming from a comp sci background) and I thought I saw a ton of potential.
I never stocked up on any coins though at the time.
In 2014 I almost set up recurring monthly purchases but then forgot about it for another 3 years.
Now bitcoin is going stronger than ever and I still believe in it just as much as I did seven years ago.
If you're interested in bitcoin I encourage you to learn as much as you can about the underlying technology. Also, try to understand game-theory type arguments for why various "attacks" on bitcoin might fail. Bitcoin is demonstrating some spectacular resilience IMO.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:27:36
This is just how it works when you have a fork that attracts value. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:56:52
Nobody wants bitcoin to not scale they just concede that the layer 1 solution can't keep scaling exponentially forever. It's better to accept that now and work on layer 2 solutions designed to scale instead of delaying the inevitable.
And no, it is possible to have a good store of value that you can't buy everyday things with. I don't go it and buy things with my IRA...

@_date: 2017-11-14 03:05:37
How does LN do that?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:53:24
When you say it would be more valuable to you if it drops to $600, and stays there, you realize you are saying it will be more valuable to you if it never achieves mass adoption... which doesn't make sense.
If bitcoin price stays at $600, the market cap will never surpass 12 billion USD and it will never be more than a drop in the bucket in the currency world. It will not be mass-adopted.
Mass adoption and high bitcoin price go hand in hand. They might be highly correlated with fees at the moment but are not the sole causal factor and won't always be the main driving force.
You cannot have mass adoption and have the price stay low, it's simply not possible to have it both ways. 
So to say something like the value of bitcoin is too high and is creating barriers to mass adoption is backwards. 
It's the scaling issues that have been present from the start that are the barriers to mass adoption, it's only now that the network is large enough to bump up against those issues.
I agree though, the fees are too high right now and it's putting some drag on the whole ship.

If bitcoin cash is banking on dealing with 8 times as many transactions as bitcoin, and if the market actually brings the wealth there like they hope, then we could see bitcoin crash far lower than 6000.
This is not something to worry about, though. BCH chose the temporary band-aid solution that will not scale, and eventually it will catch up to them.
Bitcoin is still playing the long game and making sure to do it properly.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:00:45
It's not "supposed" to be anything, it is what it is. It offers value through the potential for permissionless, trustless transactions and it's just morphing into a maximum-value system through an organic process.

@_date: 2017-11-13 12:57:21
This. Any situation where bitcoin drops a whole lot is necessarily going to be in a context where some people are truly freaking out and think this is the end. If they weren't, then the price would not drop so much.
The fact that we've only seen a dip to 5800 or something is telling...
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:16:50
It's slow and steady wins the race. 
People are getting so pushy and eager to have their instant low fee payment mechanism that they wanna compromise long-term potential and rush out ahead with things like BCH and segwit2x.

People don't use gold as a day to day currency or really call it a currency at all for that matter but it has a market cap way beyond bitcoin.
Bitcoin doesn't have to dominate at being currency to be worth many many times more what it is now. Just being a good enough store of value could easily be enough. There are many arguments for why it might be better at this than gold.
But yeah, hopefully second layer solutions will make it more practical for small transactions.

It's GitHub, anyone is free to fork the repository and work on their own Core client if they want. 
Anyone's free to submit updates for inclusion in Core. I'm sure the developers would be more than happy to receive some good code.
Core doesn't necessarily define what bitcoin is, though. It just has a status as the de-facto standard reference client because of its long history and quality of its development team.
Bitcoin development also proceeds in other repositories. There are at least 3 where work on the lightning network is happening. 
Again, it's open-source so anyone can jump in if they have something worthwhile to contribute. Anyone can fork (copy) all of that code and work on and nobody will be mad! In fact, that is exactly how open source is supposed to work.
Maybe YOU can be the one to implement and test a working LN node. Better get to it!

It's not the gitbhub owners though... if there were any official mechanism to gauge consensus then that would be centralized. Consensus is a messy, unofficial, organic process. 
Consensus is also not just what people say on Reddit. That is a very very thin slice of the full bitcoin ecosystem. The fact that most people were unfazed and are sticking with bitcoin is reflected in the small magnitude of the price drop. If community truly lost faith due to lack of block size increase then we would see wayyyyy more selloff. In a sense consensus is reflected in the price of bitcoin.
Core decisions are not made in a back room. The open source process means all changes are public, and generally devs are giving well-thought-out technical arguments for why these changes are best 
Anyone can try to understand their reasoning first and then asses the validity of it. If you find some alarming mistakes in what they're doing, please let us know.
Bitcoin development is a meritocracy not an autocracy. The reason consensus tends to follow what the core devs say is because core has attracted the best developers over the years (because bitcoin is by far the most successful crypto) and they are the people who understand the most about the technology.
This is sort of like arguing that it's unfair that the nuclear engineers get to twiddle the knobs on the nuclear reactor. 
Everyone is welcome to apply for the nuclear engineer job you just better be qualified, and you won't be accepted otherwise. You can also build your own reactor and do whatever you want with it.
I can submit trash code to the repository but nobody's going to want to incorporate it unless it contributes something of value and is done properly.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:52:44

It's becoming a great store of value but not a practical currency for day to day transactions. Supposedly the lightning network will provide a solution for this.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:27:42
I don't see how the absolute price of one bitcoin should have any effect on its use as a currency - this is determined by transaction times and fees.
For example, it doesn't matter if 1 btc is worth $100,000, or $100, it should still be possible to buy e.g. 50 USD worth and then spend it on something.
What is prohibitive now are the fees. This has a lot some to do with the price increase but is ultimately determined by demand for space to cram transactions into the block chain.
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:13:41
Good, they don't understand yet. There's still time to hoard coins.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:35:57
You know it's multiplied in price many many times before you ever bought, so why did you jump ship after not even doubling? And twice?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:44:42
I mean, the scaling problem doesn't actually change at all when you add more transactions by raising block size, you just push it back further.

Sure, if technology on the hardware level can begin scaling at the rate of the bitcoin network then no problem.
Both computing/storage/bandwidth technology as well as bitcoin generally grow or progress exponentially. The rate of exponential growth for the bitcoin network far exceeds that of these other technologies that bitcoin is dependent on. 
Eventually the block size increase solution will become completely unworkable on a physical level because the network will outpace the hardware.

Well, sounds like certain businesses are  making some bad business decisions if they have staked their entire survival to the success of such a new, volatile technology.

Remember, when there is FUD, and people panic, the subsequent drop in price is like a 'cooling off' period for bitcoin technology.
Bitcoin development is always proceeding behind the scenes but it will become easier to test/implement changes and prove their long-term worth and functionality when the network is smaller rather than larger.
The urgency for scaling solutions goes up as the price goes up, but the ease at which changes can be rolled out and proven goes down.
Network retraction is like a resting period for bitcoin. It can cool off (shake off public interest) and harden, and become stronger for future growth. 
The price may be forced to retract for awhile until lightning network solutions are thoroughly proven. 
This retraction could be substantial depending on the faith of users in the development process.
Personally I still believe bitcoin has long-term potential and this current cycle doesn't show that it is any weaker, only that it might have temporarily grown beyond a sustainable capacity.
I think there's a pretty solid floor price somewhere for bitcoin. Bitcoin has been in use for long enough now and has enough use history and old-timers/people into the technology/committed long-term holders that I don't see it crashing all the way to zero. 
Even down to a few hundred, sure. This might be the necessary thing for bitcoin. It also might not be. I don't know what will happen. 
It also seems plausible to me that bitcoin might just continue to grow in the medium term despite the large transaction fees and people complaining.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:44:05
Right, if you are holding on to extra fiat in order to save it so you can invest it later in btc, you're either doing it wrong (accepting lower expected returns) or intentionally sacrificing returns by holding fiat in exchange for not assuming the risk of holding bitcoin.
But if you're intentionally holding extra fiat to do that, are you sure you want to invest in bitcoin?
There is a big misconception here about DCA, that it is this special investment strategy that "smooths out dips/peaks" so that you get your btc at a discount, on average. 
That's not how it works; relative to a lump investment up front, DCA is only missing out on returns in exchange for not having the risk of holding bitcoin. DCA is a slightly more sophisticated way of holding fiat in the naive hope that you will be lucky enough to buy a dip. Only with DCA, you buy at a particular time regardless of price.)
Note: if you can only invest X per month, then by all means do so. But if you can afford a lump sum investment and believe the long-term value of bitcoin will increase, then you will LOSE expected returns by holding fiat to pursue DCA.
Another argument I see thrown around in favor of DCA is that lump-sum only works if the price "only goes up" while DCA works if it goes down, too. 
What's more likely, bitcoin generally going up long-term, or going down, substantially, at just the right times? Because that is the only situation where DCA will be profitable. So, your DCA being profitable relative to other investment strategies depends on bitcoin going down in price. If you believe bitcoin is going down, then why invest in it?

It's a bad strategy in the same way that astrology is a bad strategy for doing real science.
Bottom line is you can't predict the market without some special insider info.
Many other people are trying to make money off of trading. Whenever you try to strategically trade you are competing with them, and if they make money, it will be coming from other traders like you. 
This negates opportunities for you to make money, and if you try, the expected outcome statistically is that fees and luckier traders will siphon off your returns and you will be worse off than if you just hodl.
