I'm going to give slush a go as soon as I get into that old hotmail account, which is looking less likely every day.
If I emailed the pool operators with my config file that had my worker's name and password, do you think that would be enough to let me access my funds? Will they be understanding?

Monero had the scaling issue solved a long time ago. It also had the fungibility issue solved. The only issue with it is that the devs care so much about the code library for the network that they put official wallet software on the backburner. If you can tolerate third-party GUI wallets or a command line wallet, it's a very good altcoin.
Honestly, if you want to walk away from this disgusting community and its first-generation crap cryptocurrency, Monero is your most attractive option right now.

Can somebody help me? I mined a little in I think 2011 using Slush or BTCGuild or some other big pool at the time. I used my grandmother's computer which was actually quite good at the time. The config file with my worker name is probably still on it and I'm visiting her for Christmas. The only problem is that I can probably remember the hotmail address I used to log in, but I was locked out of that hotmail address ages ago. If I try to contact the pool I used according to that config file and gave them the contents of the config file, possibly along with the IP I used if grandmother's connection has a static IP, would they give me what I mined back then? It could be a substantial amount and I never withdrew it.
Edit: I'm willing to share some of the money if somebody helps me.
Edit: I contacted microsoft about the old hotmail account. I was able to verify that it's mine by giving the code they sent to a recovery address, but I'm not going to get a response for about 24 hours. Maybe I can see what's in the old hotmail account to try to get my account on the pool I used, but there is a chance that microsoft won't let me back into my account.

I thought people were encouraged to stop using bitcoin fog several months ago. They even had a special banner about it on the dnm sub. What gives?

darkcoin tech is obsolete already. masternodes are a bad way of accomplishing anonymity. imagine how many masternodes are on aws!
@_date: 2014-12-28 23:25:55
I'm interested in the Monero and Shadowcash altcoins for this purpose.
@_date: 2015-01-08 07:46:23
what would you guess monero will be worth by the end of the summer? by next thanksgiving?
I have about 25 of them. I love the fundamentals, but I don't see much in the way of infrastructure. however I seriously believe it's the best contender to bitcoin. doesn't rely on bitcoin codebase. I believe there are html wallets already.
it's way better than darkcoin, but darkcoin is more well-known that monero. that's a shame! darkcoin's coinjoin and masternodes are such a joke.

Much too early to call it. You sentence them to burning at the stake before they have had breakfast.
I never had a problem with slush leaving the default on core. It only makes sense. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 21:16:54
you forgot about Monero
@_date: 2016-01-09 00:05:11
It's also reassuring that monero is not just another port of bitcoin. It has a separate and distinct codebase. If something is horrifically wrong with bitcoin and all other altcoin ports of bitcoin, then monero will likely be immune to the issue.

I can't select the appropriate fee without knowing beforehand how many outputs my wallet wants to make. Mycelium and Jaxx don't show this. Is there a wallet that does?

You don't look serious at all when you invoke santa claus and body parts, or insinuations about somebody's age. Vitriol against a "wrong opinion" is worse than "spam."

I didn't even know it was possible to buy through paypal. I thought you could only sell.

Neither got hacked. What got hacked was a smart contract written by (very irresponsible) private individuals.

I still feel as though it's rather telling you would sink as low as to compare me to a fictional animal when I am simply finding a way to express my concerns. I'd expect better from a more civil community. Perhaps you have too much skin in the game for your own good.

If you pride yourself on your achievements in the bitcoin ecosystem, why go through the trouble of belittling users on a forum? I don't make an effort to participate in a discussion just to be demoralized with a joke from a children's book.
@_date: 2016-02-10 17:55:58
You think this sort of thing should happen overnight? Or the fact there is not 100% adoption immediately after release means it's a failure?
@_date: 2016-02-24 11:00:48
Please take a moment to explain to me just what it is you stand to gain from continuing to insult those who disagree with you. I fail to understand how that kind of behavior gives rise to a healthy and productive discussion. Instead of resorting to schoolyard tactics to silence me, maybe you should try to be civil and formulate an argument about why my observations are misguided. The people in that sub are not numpties, they are bitcoin users in search of answers.

Please don't treat me like a child. That's not what I signed up for when I mined my first block six years ago. It's unbecoming.
@_date: 2016-02-15 07:40:11
There are much better reasons to switch to circle than a poorly titled blog post. Where have you been for the past couple of years?
@_date: 2016-02-10 20:46:21
Adoption isn't just nodes. Don't fall into the trap of thinking the pie chart on coindance is the only important metric.

Blocks are on the verge of being full on a regular basis. What makes you think that isn't a crisis already?
Also I can't help but think that RBF is a band-aid on the increasing mempool issue.

If somebody gave me money to get a job done, I might be tempted to get a macbook. Then I'd install linux and use windows in a vm as well.

you actually meant to say monero, not darkcoin
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:55:22

os x is perfectly acceptable for development. I never said it wasn't. I just feel like it'd be wrong to call it the best tool for the job.

satoshi is a picture of an east-asian man's face. he doesn't even have arms or legs
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:59:33
why is os x the best way to develop on the blockchain? are you sure you're not a biased programmer? are you even a programmer?
I still think it's unlikely that Bitcoin is the best implementation of a blockchain currency. My personal favorite is Monero.
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:07:22
bitcoin is due for a successor anyway. monero is better in many ways, not just the privacy feature.
I figure the first go at a blockchain based token system is not going to be the best. a fresh codebase is always a good thing when dealing with altcoins.
