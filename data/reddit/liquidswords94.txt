the Chiense economy is experiecing a housing bubble similar to the one we experieciced but in even worse... millions of apartments, cities of them are being built, and bought by people who wants tangible assets as long term investments partailly because they dont trust the yuan. anyways nobody lives in these and its driving the prices up recently the government passed a "one house per family" rule like the "one child" policy in an attempt to prevent a bubble. but its already happening. the wheels have stopped turning, housing contractors who took out loans cant repay them , first the workers left, now there are concrete skeletons of cities. anyways, all im trying to say is the last thing sensible chinese want to do is buy real estate.
