A sacrifice has been made to Satoshi himself! This means he shall grant is the bull run to $100k! Thank you for the sacrifice! Comment thank you Mr. Nakamoto to receive his bull run blessing. All that don’t will sell low.

And they could be right. No one knows. Just buy and HODL.
@_date: 2019-11-14 04:38:35
They’re just using meme magic to bring the price down. I know how this game works and I ain’t falling for it! HODL!

I was literally thinking that BTC need to pop like 30% soon to even been close on hitting that’s October price. Bois it could happen.

@_date: 2019-06-11 03:59:28
Great idea thought!

As I always says, price predictions are worthless
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:15:42
Well your laptop never actually stored those 10000 BTC, you just had the private address stored there. If you can somehow find that, you're gold!
@_date: 2019-04-10 03:29:23
I do see your point. Tho I feel bitcoin and gold are both hedges against recessions so I feel both would go up
@_date: 2019-04-27 04:47:22
So good!
@_date: 2019-12-15 15:12:34
Nice copy pasta ��
@_date: 2019-04-11 03:39:50
30?! You got to pump those numbers up!
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:22:24
Yeahhhh this is not a bull market still 
@_date: 2019-04-23 04:25:05
@_date: 2019-04-13 05:27:52
Hah I was just thinking that! Someone should make a parade video about this
@_date: 2019-04-26 03:30:24
 Cringy
@_date: 2019-04-10 03:27:26
This is the first guy getting hacked when bitcoin reaches a million
@_date: 2019-04-09 03:57:23
What the hell does that even mean
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:28:37
Wouldn't shorting gold be the opposite of hedging in this case? Wouldn't you want to own $1 BTC with $0.7 gold?
@_date: 2019-04-10 03:28:14
Well shit
@_date: 2019-04-11 03:43:48
Coinbase -&gt; Binance -&gt; Monero -&gt; KuCoin -&gt; BTC -&gt; Ledger
I think this should work?
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:11:50
Haha yes, this will make sure 100% you’re private!
@_date: 2019-04-09 03:54:00
Have your paper wallet contain exactly the amount of btc you want to spend. Then give them the paper wort the public and private key on it.

I just bought the newest Trezor. I’m excited to get it! I love how they’ve oven sourced it all. I’ll be downloading the BTC only firmware for sure
@_date: 2019-09-01 06:15:37
Sure, but I could just go to the market and get it for sub $10k
@_date: 2019-09-09 03:45:27
Where did you get these cool paper wallets?
@_date: 2019-09-11 04:10:08
Best koolaid
@_date: 2019-09-11 04:15:10
Is the firmware open source thought?
