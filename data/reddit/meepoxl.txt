My friend is not computer literate, where as I am. It's why I'm helping him out.

50% capital gains tax discount on it, so he has no issue paying taxes and keeping money legitimately. Being a tax dodge isn't worth it.  
Living room of satoshi is a legitimate way to pay for things like bills without paying taxes (legally). Unless something changes recently with tax laws in regards to LROS?
We'll check out BTC markets, thanks.

It will dip lower. The charts show a head and shoulders set up which means it's a trend reversal (i.e. we heading south). I think we will see a bounce at either $3750 - $3800. If that fails, the next stop is $3450. Worst case scenario is $2850 and then a bounce back upwards.
Keep your eye out for those levels. Sell on the breakdown and buy back at the next level.
Or just HODL... Long term is still bullish. Retracement is normal and healthy.

The owners of the banks are the share holders. It was also mentioned in the video.

Eh.. Looking at the charts, $3k-3.1k is the support.
Then $2.6k.
Looking at the daily, it's not really sustainable. I can't think of a single stock that has ever maintained a run like this without a retrace. 
It's coming. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it is coming. It's not doom and gloom, it's just a standard retrace.. Expect it.

Urgh... "Secret owners of the Federal Reserve" is nonsense.
The Fed reserve is a public entity run like a private one where banks can own stock and gain interest.
"Each Reserve Bank has its own board of directors, which oversees the Bank's activities. These directors contribute local business experience, community involvement, and leadership and reflect the diverse interests of each District. Each board has nine members. Six of the directors are elected by member commercial banks. Three of the directors are appointed by the Board of Governors. From among these three, the Board of Governors selects a chairman and a deputy chairman of the given Bank's board. "
