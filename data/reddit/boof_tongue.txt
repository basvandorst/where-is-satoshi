No, I would set it at slow or use a custom fee.  The mempool isn't clogged or anything.  If you look at [THIS CHART]( you can see how many satoshis you need and what confirmation speed you can expect.  More than likely it will be a lot cheaper than the preset fees on your ledger.

What makes the ultimate difference is our behavior.  We can have any tool and make it a weapon.  With Bitcoin, we finally have a mechanism in which we no longer are pitted against each other, in that bitter battle for the bare bits of wealth they leave us.  And who knows, maybe Satoshi is waiting, so when the money masters strike, so can Satoshi.

I don't believe the freedom part is equatable to wealth.  What happens is that our dollars, our pounds, our pesos, all lose their value.  Every year, month after month, day after day, your spending power loses it's potency.  Your gas, your milk, your clothes, all cost more as time goes on.  And they always will.  Because that's what their money is designed to do.  But not with Bitcoin.
We will always work.  Any man or woman who doesn't, must despise themselves and those they love.  There are never any free rides.  Not for those who want a just and fairer world.  I work because I love you, because I love this world, and because I love the people in it.  Even the ones we seek vengeance against. 
What will happen is that the world you're used to, the one that siphons the very last bit of energy from you, that consumes every bit and second of your time, that demands your subservience for fear of being ostracized and cast away as a poor beggar or jail steward, will be broken.  A world where your value is not stolen from you.  Where your time does not depreciate and survival is not bought.  
I cannot describe the new world I speak of to you because I have never been there.  I have dreamed it and I have heard others dreams of it.  I know this world can be real.  Help me make it true.

How does *bitzealot* sound?  Or are you thinking *bitvangelist*?  
I think I use the word "divine" to describe things that have traits of other worldly justice.  Like something when you look at it, you just realize it took a long time for it to happen and you're just like, "Dayyyummm, I can't believe how this happened." 
I used the "praise" as a recognition of the theological romanticism I was using.  Hence the ^^Ahhmmmmm.  You know, that humming sound the monks make?

Check out this article:
One quote from the article says "There is absolutely no way that an attacker could replace the firmware and make it pass attestation, without knowing the Ledger private key."
Looks like you should be pretty safe regardless if it passes that attestation test.
Here is another article about verifying the integrity:
While it is probably best to buy it directly from the manufacture, you will probably be safe as long as you verify its integrity with attestation.  Ledger even has an Amazon account.

1. Go to Accounts

5. Enter the address you want to send to.
6. Send
I would recommend getting a Ledger Nano S or Trezor.  I never keep coins on Coinbase and only transfer them when I want to sell.  Keeping coins on coinbase means you don't have control of them and if coinbase is hacked or shutdown, your coins are gone.  You can transfer coins between wallets as much as you want.  Just have to pay fees.

I mine BTC and it *is* profitable for me.  I have electrical included in my industrial zoned rental space so *free electricity*.  
The only place to buy an Antimer S9 for a price that isn't outrageously marked up is from [BITMAIN](  Most everyone here knows Jihan Wu owns BITMAIN so most people aren't fans but it really is the only place to get them.  
Once you get the miners it's pretty easy.  Just make sure you have a way to cool the miners once they are running and you should be good.  If you have any more questions feel free to PM me.  I post a lot on r/BitcoinMining helping people so your other option is to start a thread over there.

What's an S9?! Well there's your first task. Don't be coming all noob style or no one will help you. Use your college research skills and look some stuff up before posting some pumpkin spice basic bitch bullshit. 
Unfortunately, there's no gaming rig or anything as such that will mine any worthwhile amount of BTC. It is possible but you're better off with dedicated asic machines (S9). This is more than likely out of your budget. Maybe tell Mom and Dad someone stole all your books and ask for some extra cash?

Well, you can actually do the things you say can't be done so... [How about a motorcycle?](  [Or an X-Men arcade game?](  [Or maybe you want to go to a football game?](  I'm sure these trivial activities are beyond your dignified self tho.. sorry.

I just bought three!  Two larges and a XXL.  Do the shirts run big or small?
Edit: Also, how can I see more of the shirts you offer?
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:27:27
*fingers* ^^^^were *crossed*
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:40:47
Or what about a shirt that says:
**Breaking Banks since 08**
and why not rip off the keep calm shit:
**Keep Calm and HODL**
or what about a shirt with a picture of the moon and instead of the US flag you put a BTC flag? Or an astronaut holding a BTC flag?  Or the closeup pic of the astronaut and superimpose the BTC logo in the astronauts visor?
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:31:28
I don't know what's going on but Slush Pool was killing it today too.

.. and maybe put a BTC symbol on it?
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:17:44
This is something that has happened within the last two months.  I used to regularly check my slushpool rewards (e.g. 0.00221567 BTC) by just searching "(enter # here) BTC Value" and would get a google snippet result with the price and a way to adjust each figure.  Now it seems google has removed that snippet.  *Is google part of the FUD team?!?* /s

Hahaha. Best comment today for me.

Well... I first read this and was like, "This guy is a moron."  
And then I looked it up.  [Here's the New York State Department of Financial Services Regulations.](
Apparently, at least one party will need a NYDFS Bitlicense.

Hmm... Can I change my two L's to XL's and the XXL to XXXL without cancelling the amazon order?
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:17:26
It's a good point. I just thought it was funny to tell someone to close your coinbase account and open a GDAX. Like.. you already have a GDAX bruh.
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:40:58
In Coinbase you will find the *USD Wallet* under the *Accounts* section.  From there you'll have to enable it.
@_date: 2017-10-10 05:32:00
Get a Ledger Nano S. Take your BTC off coinbase.  When you want to sell use GDAX.com.  GDAX is owned by coinbase and you use your coinbase login information.  
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:05:11
Yeah, well... I coulddddd cancel the order. But I'm not going to.  Just gonna get six and hand them out. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:03:15
Noah knew
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:55:25
You realize GDAX and Coinbase use the same login info?  And that they are the same company right?
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:39:35
@_date: 2017-10-10 05:28:08
Ledger Nano S will work.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:02:11
You can never too wise in a situation like this. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:43:15
For real tho.. is there a more abrasive and insensitive way to put that?  For fucks sake, OP.  Seriously, it's incredibly offensive and inappropriate and doesn't help accentuate your point.  At all.
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:08:20
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bitcoin on the deathstar.. I mean.. aren't we the good guys?
@_date: 2017-10-10 05:51:31
Use your Coinbase login info to sign into [GDAX](  It's owned by the same company.  
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:50:45
Is that how your post happened or how S2X was made?
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:27:44

@_date: 2018-04-24 01:52:39
You should get a [Nano Ledger S](
Edit:  So the *semi-technical* answer is when you don't have control over your private keys, it means you don't have control of your Bitcoin.  Coinbase right now controls your private keys.  If Coinbase has [Insert desired tradgedy] happen, it means you lose your coins.  The only reason to keep any crypto on Coinbase is to sell.  With as low as fees are right now ([less than 10 satoshis]( it's not that big of a deal to transfer any coin.

You do bring up some good points.  Appreciate it.

What's a couple hundred today, what could be a few thousand tomorrow, right? *Fuck it*
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:16:33
Do you have a recommended way of keeping the units cool?
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:12:48
Oh, silly me. I just assumed he'd buy the wallet with fiat. But besides that, you're failing to give appreciations to one of the fundamental and philosophical pillars of Bitcoin -- personal ownership, being in control of your own money. Any recommendations other than that, are poorly thought out. Plain and simple.

It's a rental space of a large factory building that is sectioned off into at least 6 other businesses.  A steel company, an electrical company and a car repair business to name a few.  The electricity bill for the entire facility is lumped together.
EDIT: Rent includes heat and electricity.  So yes, a rent amount is paid but no added electricity costs.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:00:14
So I ordered the hardware direct from Bitmain.  Should I not use the AntPool they offer?
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:02:30
Thanks for the info.  I'm reading more about Segwit right now.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:20:32
Yes, I used poor wording.  I *do* realize there is a cost... for someone.
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:35:53
The facility was recently sold.  In between the transition of owners the electricity bill went unpaid.  During this time we found out that the monthly electricity bill is between $1,000 and $2,500 depending on the activity of the tenants.  We calculated an added cost of approximately $230.00 added to the bill a month constantly running all 5 machines.  I can say with a fair deal of confidence that it will go unnoticed.
EDIT: 


It's a major concern.  We have a refrigerator we were thinking of housing the units in but we're worried about air circulation.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:53:14
We were thinking of modifying the refrigerator door to have a fan system.
@_date: 2017-05-16 20:52:00
I've been following the prices and batch releases from BitMain for quite a few months now and haven't really noticed a significant change in price.  Is there something else you're referring too?
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:58:44
As a business, I believe that the wording of our lease agreement allows us to operate under no penalty of law.  Incurred costs (specifically electricity) from business operations are the sole responsibility of the property owner. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:07:32
I appreciate you taking the time to provide this [info](  I'm definitely leaning towards using Slush.

The account I have at CoinBase isn't sufficient?  I have both a wallet and a vault setup that both have unique QR codes and addresses.

That seems highly implausible when I look at current transaction fees:
