A VPS may help you. Amazon or Digitalocean

Actually you can, I had an issue which bitcoind always crash within minutes inside Digitalocean droplet with 1G ram &amp; 1GB swap while syncing the last portion of blockchain given that torrent only have blocks up to 279,000 (AFAIK). That is without limiting maxconnections but with disablewallet=1.
A workaround is limit maxconnections to 9 or lower until syncing complete. With that you will have a chance with 3.25$ option. Go ahead and test.
With 2GB ram it took 99.x% of ram while syncing and now it is at 70+% with disablewallet=1 and maxconnections=9 to save ram. I will increase maxconnections to 15 and see.

**Harden your bitcoin node**

ctrl + o then ctrl + x
    chmod +x rules.sh
    sudo ./rules.sh
list rules
    sudo iptables -L
check connectivity using 
, I followed your guide except ufw didn't work as listed in [pastebin file]( Above is the workaround.

Inspired by your post, just now started a full node in VPS. in Ubuntu 13.10 x64 the bitcoin ppa doesn't pull latest 0.9.x. Workaround was editing sources.list and add [sources for 0.9.x](
downloaded bootstrap from 
Alternatively from 
This method requires minimum of 35GB storage space to bring up a full node in less than an hour.
Pretty fast.
You can get an idea about full nodes from

I'm not familiar with South A. But when you come back share your story here.
@_date: 2014-04-29 15:09:06
Did you use the bootstrap blockchain [torrent file]( to get syncing much faster? 
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:23:40
My favourite wallet and it is super fast in syncing.

Guess my approach is not suitable. Paypal and bitcoin doesn't go well. Sorry about that.
I'm searching for the best vps accepting bitcoin now. Stay tuned.

If this is legit, Could be the place they do burn in testing until unpack and ship to customers. 
May be the burn in is slightly longer to make sure failure rates are low. A few weeks may be, eh?

Deployed 2 full nodes in East coast and West coast. Looking for a good vps deal in EU or Asia for another node.
Looking for a good vps in Africa and South America too.
Glad to see many volunteers creating full nodes at their own cost.

Cool CSI
@_date: 2014-04-23 05:26:41
Yes we need more polished UI for a wallet on top of top notch backend.
For the name you can do a reddit poll if needed.

Only happens with tx from/to coinbase?
Bitcoin-qt/multibit transactions safe?
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:12:50
As people said you can run bitcoin core in ur Mac opening 8333 in router or with upnp. 
Considering the bw and other factors, far better to run a full node on VPS. 
Check digitalocean 10$ free offer or weloveservers 19$ per year offer.

A bit techie way is running a p2pool node for bitcoin. You will receive bitcoins as node fee.
Depends whether your nodes have active miners.

I hope you invested an amount you can afford to lose. Now if your wife has a concern about your financial investments, then you must invest an amount your wife can afford to lose. :)
But now, you are beyond that, take the BTC/USD graph for last 4+ years and look for bubbles.

Is there some way to speed up my transaction confirmations using my own node?

Hopefully it will never get Gox effect.
