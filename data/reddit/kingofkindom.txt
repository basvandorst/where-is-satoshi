Terrorists are cheap:)
A lot of money they are spending to keep Americans in mental slavery: hundreds of billions on media and surveillance.

Jumping to 100k isn’t conspiracy. Its one million times more possible than jumping from $0.001 to $1 which happened. 
However putting life savings into bitcoin is insane. Put $1000. 
I’ve bought in the middle of 2017 for about 3% of my (not life) savings and regret now.

I think Ill do nothing.
If it hits 20k - oh man thats just previous ATH, it can reach 40k next day. 
If it hits 80k - thats only x4 of previous ATH, while early bitcoin always reached at least x15 of prev ATH. 
After all, if I miss 80k and it start falling, it will not go too deep and eventually will reach even more in the future. 
So Ill HODL!)

On LB there is a stats for every trader showing bitcoins average release time. Just choose one with less than 3 mins in average and median.
Also there is a user rating which can be ruined by just single vote.
Personally I had no problems on LB at all.

Assad’s “civilian killings” is complete fake created by west govts and terrorists backed by west. Last “chemical attack” was a fake and revealed:

So Bitcoin is PoW because of mining or checking (by nodes) or both?
