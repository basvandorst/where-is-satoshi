Can't truly trade something that takes minutes or hours to confirm trades thereof...

Yeah, my career in capital markets is irrelevant here.

Doesn't matter if it's uncorrelated, if it always goes down.

None of these things have stopped the majority of current and past buyers, who generally don't understand the tech or economics of the thing either. If they did, they would acknowledge it for the gamble it is.

Yeah, that's always the problem, markets can remain irrational for a long time. Good luck!

I don't pick arbitrary numbers. I just maintain that the expected long-term value of BTC is zero.

Because Dec '17 represented the moment that the set of "all potential buyers" became aware of the existence of BTC... after that moment, there are no great bodies of "greater fools" ready to buy. Supply remains higher than demand and will as long as there is no economy of BTC... and there will never be, because it is (a) not anonymous (b) not efficient and (c) not trustworthy.

Lots of things. Volatility. Misaligned incentives of middlemen (exchanges; wallet providers; etc. - and whether these can be mitigated with a cold physical wallet is irrelevant - average Joes now believe it is possible to have their BTC vanish forever).

Yes. Basic derivatives stuff. Sell a future = short position. Similar economics to selling a stock short, or buying a put option.
