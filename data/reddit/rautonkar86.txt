I feel CryptoCurrency is built for being able to trade i.e. exchange goods and services. Holding on to true CC, in absence of fiat has no value. You eventually will want/have to spend it. Sure conversion to current fiat currency will let you buy stuff, but then it’s just the numbers being transferred to someone else. It never leaves the digital boundary.
The only difference between fiat and CC is that fiat has defined the value for goods and services in each country and between them. If/when CC establishes globally, that will be the challenge. Similar to the challenge of the barter era...just backed by the speed and efficiency of computers, which is what the early phase of mining has done... Setup the infrastructure. Concentrating a CC in one spot will have a net effect of making that version of CC less attractive. When society has experienced the power of “high speed-low cost-secure” transaction at an individual level such a concentration can push for a change in the commonly accepted CC. Making that CC concentration worthless. That’s another dark path I feel... Point being, those with a lot of CC in the beginning will take a lot longer to shell it out but it will happen eventually. 
The only way you can truly lose cryptocurrency is by encrypting it and losing the key.  Then the game is to wait for the encryption to break. IMO Theoretically one could also buy all the cryptocurrency and defunct it to end all trade; but then that’s a huge sum to pay for destruction. 
P.S.: would love to hear some arguments and thoughts around this thinking.
