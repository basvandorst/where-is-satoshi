Odds are Crypto's will become monopolistic competition or oligopoly soon. BTC will have a direct competitor and maybe 3 wildcards to compete against. Rest will be have very limited purchasing power and few devs supporting them.
BTC might just hard-fork itself to make a major update and to increase BTC supply hard cap. 
We are not running out of Crypto, more will be issued to meet demand. Right now Crypto is in its infancy.

* Number 4: Bitcoin has Fungible issues
USD can be used previously in criminal transactions but is still legal tender (if bill is not counterfeit). Bitcoins are pretty much blacklisted by exchanges if used previously in criminal transaction.
* Hence the need for coin anonymity such as Coinmix/Coinjoin, Z-Snark, Darksend ect. To be added to BTC. 
* Numbers 1 thru 3 are stale arguments repeated by parrot FUDsters.

Then how does BTC solve split decisions if there are like 3 factions with three different proposals? Do they have a 2/3 vote or passes with 51% vote?

Been trying to sell my Fashion for Crypto/Cash in Hand on swap meets. Just doesn't sell when Goodwill is selling used Sneakers for $8. Buyers rather have $8 New Balance vs $100+ Ballys/Air Jordans ect.

Why is sending single satoshi payments even a factor at this point? Nether coin has purchasing power high enough to make a single satoshi worth a $1.00+ USD.

"The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 20 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top." (earn.com)
0.00000020 btc = 20 satoshis= 0.0016 USD
Transaction fee (set by sender) is based on how backed up mempool is, and how fast you need the complete transaction. With Segwit and less overloading it's far less then December/January 2017.
Buyers will no longer have to pay a big surcharge to buy with BTC vs other alts.

Sadly outside of btc circle no one said the transaction fees went down. I double checked the article and it is legit.
BTC pulled off lower transaction fees without block size increase?

More Mining Strength less power consumption sounds like a great idea. The question remains should Bitcoin wait a few years before switching to the Quantum Computers, or does Blockstream have the funds in order to start now? One Quantum Computer costs $15 Million Dollars (D-Wave Q2000)

They moved to IPFS which allows syndication when node is offline for only a few days. Big network improvement from 2014/2015 as offline stores couldn't get paid.
