Your willingness to lose your investment, has no bearing on the reality of what you have invested in.

No intrinsic value.  Faux scarcity.  Price reliant on ever increasing capital inflows to remain buoyant.  Unrealistic 'returns' which benefit those who bought in early.  Not a functional currency as promised, ie: no utility.  Subject to massive fraud and market manipulation.  Price entirely based on speculative buying from inexperienced investors.
There is a very good reason Bitcoins creator remains anonymous.  They were likely intelligent enough to understand that once this bubble bursts, they would be locked up.

Dead Cat Bounce dude, people buying what they think is the bottom.  
Bitcoin is linked to nothing other than the money people are putting in to the pot.
Big coin holders are just going to keep taking funds out over time, fleecing the new money coming in.  Wealth transfer complete.

If you HODL while everyone sells and crashes the market, you realise they are just taking your money right?
Do yourself a favour and go read the Wikipedia definition of Ponzi, they even talk about HODL as a strategy to prop up the price.
Bitcoin has literally ALL of the characteristics of a Ponzi.  
Jesus you people are dense.

All these idiots don't understand that the only purpose Bitcoin serves is to transfer wealth from the foolish, to the early 'investors'

False logic.  Thats like saying a t-shirt factory which commits to making only 21 million shirts is 'limited' and therefore rare and valuable....
Ignoring the fact the t-shirt factory down the road can made virtually identical t-shirts in unlimited quantities.
Bitcoin is no different.

Does this figure include the actual exchange (buy/sell) of Bitcoins (or other Crypto currencies) - looking at the charts, I believe it does.
Any meaningful figure needs to exclude these exchanges, the better measure is exchanges related to the purchase of goods/services.

Suggesting Bitcoin has any kind of intrinsic value is like saying the hot air that comes out of my space heater has value, the only common factor being electricity was used to make it.
I took a shit earlier, it was a one of a kind shit, extremely limited supply - that thing is worth a fortune I tell ya, limited to only 1 unit.  Best part is you can take that shit down to your local electrical store and buy a toaster with it, you know why? the store owner knows how scarce and valuable this shit is too.  Now, can I sell you this shit - only $100,000, a steal at that price.  Buy now, because the price of this shit is going to double every 36 hours.

I agreed with everything you have said.
Once enough money flows into Bitcoin (or other Crypto) then Governments are going to take notice and regulate.  Outflows of significant enough currency from say USD to bitcoin will have tangible impacts on the economy, as well as causing huge headaches for Governments when it comes to taxation.
Regulation, or an outright ban is what will kill the price of Bitcoin.
Perhaps the underlying technology has merit and will have a future, but it will be under the ultimate control of Governments, not speculators.

Chinese state media now are talking about how OTC Bitcoin Platforms may be illegal.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:53:51
I can agree that the underlying technology has the potential to be useful, but the myth that Bitcoin is a finite resource which in turn creates the speculative bubble we are seeing now is just that, a myth.
There are already something like 700 crypto currencies out there, it's not difficult to create a currency, the same way it's not difficult for a country to print hard currency.  No one argues that hard currency is finite or scarce, because more can be produced at any time.  The same is true of digital currency regardless of any finite limitations found in a single currency such as Bitcoin.
If, and it's a big IF, there is a move to adopt cryptocurrency by a country, why would they not just create their own, one which can be regulated and taxed easily.  That is far more likely than the idea of a single world currency that everyone is going to use.  Governments are not going to allow the loss of control of their nations currency and the tools that go with it that allow them to control their economies (setting fiscal policy requires currency controls).  It's just not going to happen.

They will ban internet traffic to known bitcoin exchanges, shut down anyone who offers to exchange Bitcoin for real money, ban it as legal currency so business cannot accept it as a type of payment (nor would they accept it if they are unable to convert to real currency.  Pass laws against those who trade in it, if necessary.
If you think Governments can't kill Bitcoin, you don't understand how the financial system works.

So what? 
Any gains on Bitcoin must come from somewhere, not from thin air.  For someone to make gains, someone is losing.  Nothing more than wealth transfer.

Well, firstly it's not a stock.  Stock by definition is a share in an organisation's assets and earnings.  Bitcoin has no earnings, and holds no assets.  If you value it as a stock, it's worthless.
It's a commodity (the SEC agrees here) which means it is valued based on supply and demand.  It has no utility, so supply and demand is generated how? In Bitcoins case, price speculation and nothing more.
Therefore, Bitcoins value is linked to capital inflows and outflows.  The charts themselves prove this point.  Once people realise this, capital inflows will stop and it will settle on its true value, at or around zero.

If crypto technolgy truly proves worthwhile in the long run, there is exactly Zero chance governments will adopt Bitcoin.
Countries will create their own centrally regulated cryptocurrency.  The ability for a country to control its currency is fundamental to fiscal policy, managing inflation. interest rates, among other things.
This makes Bitcoin's faux scarcity totally irrelevant, which in turn makes it worthless.
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:51:03
You are applying stock analysis techniques to a commodity with no utility, just saying.

Rocks are used to make road base, aggregated into concrete, build retaining walls, provide homes for animals, rocks are pretty damn useful.
Bitcoin is mostly used to transfer wealth from stupid people, to less stupid, but more unethical people.  Thats pretty much it for the time being.

Is Bitcoin a stock? 
If you think it's a stock, how about you run a quick stock valuation calculation and report back your findings.

That's a bullshit argument.
What is happening now will just happen again in the unlikely event Bitcoin ever inflates again.  Bubble forms, and those who call the peak cash out and everything tumbles again.  Bitcoins price is only linked to capital inflows and outflows, nothing else.
Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.

Go educate yourself on how governments control fiscal and monetary policy to influence their economies.  None of the tools used are possible with a currency like Bitcoin.
