I liked the question. I think it depends on the project and its management. We are starting a new project Tlind. I am sure it will become a Cryptocurrency.

Thank you for your post. We are developing a new project Tlind Messenger. I think we are interested in the same topic. Can you contact us ? If it is possible the contacts are in my blog.

You can oly take this information into consideration, but it's you who should make a decision.

The topic is urgent. Spam attakc is one of the topics we think about before we start our Tlind messenger project.

I agree. It's better to get it sent to a wallet.
