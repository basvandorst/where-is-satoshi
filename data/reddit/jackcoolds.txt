Paper wallet is way better, if your gonna go with mobile wallet, try airbitz

Man the biggest regret of my life is selling 500 bitcoins for 30 dollars 5 years ago, if only i kept them
@_date: 2017-02-19 00:02:23
Sometimes its hard to be a man
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:18:50
No, i sold all of them for 30 bucks, bitcoin had no value in 2010-2011, i was just playing around and using it for forums
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:31:34
Buy from coinbase than transfer to hardware wallet 
@_date: 2017-02-18 14:31:29
You cant exchange bitcoin for paypal, i use advcash, u can deposit bitcoins and withdraw cash from ATM
@_date: 2017-02-12 12:52:26
How? can you please tell me how, i want to invest but where do i start

What wrong with liberals ? do you realize that bitcoin was made by liberals, microsoft, facebook, almost every tech company have supported refugees and have a very liberal view point, you know why because most smart people are liberals, not even joking, you can google this, you can find data to support my argument, its usually the low IQ working class  that goes for conservatives, ALL IMMIGRANTS ARE EVIL
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:05:21
No, bitcoin is actually against paypal terms and conditions. your best bet is finding someone you trust to deal with
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:10:26
This is pump talk only, if its reaches 1.5k by the end of the year, be happy
@_date: 2017-02-18 14:52:53
Coinbase and Gemini are the best  
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:42:55
can you tell me why the same thing is happening to me 
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:38:37
The price could also get under 500 dollars if ETF is denied, the reason why i told u to trade on bits is the best way for you to get the best outcome, just an advice, feel free to do what you want.
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:56:28
bitcoin will never be as big as apple, you are dreaming
@_date: 2017-02-27 21:31:43
great for you sir
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:41:14
Buying from ATM is not smart, your losing money from fees 
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:34:01
So in sweeping i dont get to chose the fee and wait longer for the money the btc to appear in my mobile wallet ?
i have some btc in my paper wallets and i want to keep them for long time, but when i decide i want to withdraw or invest, i want an easy way to do it, what do you think i should do ? import or sweep
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:36:08
Depends if the person can be trusted, better for you to trade it or keep it for later.
@_date: 2017-02-21 02:33:21
scammer, nobody trust this guy, the site will just steal your coins, u will never see that money
@_date: 2017-02-16 00:18:34
In my case, coinbase is not available in my county 
@_date: 2017-02-22 15:12:16
You can but its really hard, most people lose money cause they have no idea what they are doing
@_date: 2017-02-20 18:44:45
More than 3, its makes no sense to keep a lot of coins in your web wallets
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:23:09
What does brian wallet mean ?
@_date: 2017-02-17 12:59:56
Im thinking of using a paper wallet instead, is that a bad idea ? 
using offline bitaddress.org and print it, i would have just installed ubuntu before i print so 0 chance for malware 
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:31:51
same thing happened to me
@_date: 2017-02-24 20:21:33
Wait, i always thought sweeping and importing is the same thing ?
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:58:38
What your bitcoin wallet address, i have some couple bucks, not much but hope can help u
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:53:37
No, because the Quantum computers will be able to get the private key from the public key, but not gonna happen anytime soon, when its does our problem will be nuclear destruction, bitcoin will be the last of your problems 
@_date: 2017-02-20 12:38:45
Silver and gold is pretty hard to buy/sell, bitcoin is simple and easy
@_date: 2017-02-18 19:56:20
they are trusted yeah but coinbase and localbitcoins are much better and easier to handle 
@_date: 2017-02-20 13:56:47
But its true when you want to sell gold, you have to bring an inspector to make sure its real, i can sell bitcoin to someone in a different country with just 10 minutes, you cant beat this 
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:00:37
That how bitcoin is and will always be, if you dont like it, dont let the door hit you, bye bye 
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:21:06
Yeah never invest your family money, 400 bucks should get you 0.4 BTC, not bad, try to invest a little bit every week, don't go full day 1, also make sure to use a paper wallet to protect your coins.
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:48:35
Fee: $ 0.15 - Size: 226 bytes
@_date: 2017-02-18 13:34:02
Sorry i dont understand something, why did he keep calling you if you already give him the bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:17:47
Thank you, will keep in mind.
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:11:31
but you need to live in USA for that yeah ?
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:14:55
yeah that what im gonna do, thank you 
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:40:53
Its pathetic 
@_date: 2017-02-18 00:12:50
lol nice one, anyway its not smart to invest that much
@_date: 2017-02-18 19:26:05
Good luck, i also put my entire faith on btc
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:54:52
Thank you sir, i appreciate your help
@_date: 2017-02-22 15:27:03
Ethereum is probably the future, but sure bitcoin gonna be worth a lot more, and make a lot of people rich
@_date: 2017-02-15 22:10:04
Thank you, i will start using it in that case
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:26:23
Because most people are scammers, they can reverse the payment and open a dispute on paypal, you should go on forums and search for trusted people, if i were to sell you the 1 btc, how would i know you wont just scam me and open a dispute with PayPal? bitcoins is against their terms and conditions and they don't offer seller protection for it, maybe if you had a way to prove to me, but for now nobody will trust you based on blind faith.
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:23:50
No, you should never share your private key, its smarter to change your address to be safe, and so people cant follow your transaction history.
 
@_date: 2017-02-21 02:24:32
I heard from some people that they dont pay, is their any facts to this statement ?
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:27:29
can someone please respond 
@_date: 2017-02-20 01:47:17
Nop, either find people you trust and meet them personally and pay them via cash or buy from here, just make sure they are trusted 
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:31:14
No, that not smart, the bitcoins do not belong to you if its in coinbase 
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:03:08
Bro, i'm a noob to bitcoin, what does that mean exactly ? i paid someone 100 dollars and didnt get any confirmation
@_date: 2017-02-18 20:21:56
Do you want to buy using credit card/paypal/bank account or cash, paying someone directly ? you didn't give us a lot of info.
@_date: 2017-02-19 23:49:27
Really? You just took his words for it..
@_date: 2017-02-16 20:38:29
its mean that the price of btc will drop to 950 dollars
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:57:03


then localbitcoins is your friend 
@_date: 2017-02-20 22:22:52
Hello i feel you, you did some mistakes, everyone does, its life. i wish you all the best for what you did for the bitcoin industry. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:36:25
What programs do you use to protect yourself ?
i use avast anti-virus and malwarebytes, is this enough ? 
@_date: 2017-02-15 10:57:17
No wait
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:59:43
for me, 436 bytes and 0.0002431 BTC fees, how much long do i have to wait ?
@_date: 2017-02-22 04:58:22
And when its 5k, your gonna say oh i should have bought when its was 1100 dollars
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:11:21
how much did you sell
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:25:04
Your best bet is paper wallet 
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:11:40
bitcoinaddress is the best, has been used since 2013 with no occurring problems 
@_date: 2017-02-17 10:54:40
what linux OS should i change to ?
@_date: 2017-02-15 10:25:51
can you explain to me what that means ? 
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:56:30
Don't forget to put the BTC you bought in a hardware wallet, safer that way, its not safe to keep the btc in coinbase
