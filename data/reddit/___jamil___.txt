keep away from las vegas, my friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:23:49


except it doesn't. because it's being treated as an investment by most everyone + it's wild deflation, most people aren't spending on actually buying anything with it because they are convinced (by you people (probably not you)), that it's value will go up by so much that it's not worth it to convert it to real currency to buy a potato or door or whatever.this is one of the real problems that happen with deflationary spirals.
not to mention the real problems with the blockchain, which is partly why it's gone down in value recently.

You obviously don't know how the FDIC works. They just don't insure any bank. If a bank seeks FDIC insurance, they have to accept certain oversight and regulations and cede control over certain practices to the FDIC. It's not just like the government will bail out any bank just cause they are a bank. Read up on shit yo.

unpossible! my snek flag says otherwise!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:53:52
lol what incredible horseshit. the FDIC is what makes banks take aggressive risks? Gee.. what happened before the FDIC that made that institution necessary? hmm....
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:27:41
both were inherently useful? unlike btc...
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:44:59
i know what i'm talking about. keep away from vegas.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:06:10
yeah, with houses you have actual, tangible assets. with cryptocurrency, you have nothing. it's worse than the beanie babies bubble
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:01:36
welcome to the old timey feeling of what it was like during the bank runs in the 1930s, before FDIC existed. how exhilarating!

your quotes of adam smith agreed with my point. how brainless are you?
@_date: 2018-08-21 00:37:18
the "reality" that the only restraint on businesses in capitalism is concern about their reputation in the public square? that's a sadistic version of anarchism. Read The Wealth of Nations, perhaps you might have an idea of what capitalism actually is.
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:31:14
no. no it is not.
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:06:29
I'm not sure how someone can be so stupid and still exist. Do your parents keep you on life support? Have the doctors told them that brain death is not a recoverable condition?
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:30:13
your idiotic post proved my point. how dumb are you?
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:10:40
you should read the quote you took from my post. really. read it again. read it in context. then realize how dumb you are.
@_date: 2018-08-21 09:39:38
stupid troll is boring
@_date: 2018-08-22 15:30:35
sad how desperate for attention you are. no, none of my statements were proven wrong. you are just an idiot and have zero reading comprehension.

Don't bitcoin brokers take a fee when people need to convert btc to usd or euros?
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:24:58


this will never happen. just like you can't pay the US gov't in Euros or the British gov't in Yen or the Brazilian gov't in pounds, etc
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:31:25
You are missing the point over and over. 
Theoretically, if on tuesday 1 loaf of bread = 1USD &amp; also 1 loaf of bread = 1BTC, but on wednesday 1 loaf of bread = 1USD &amp; also 1 loaf of bread = 1.2BTC, then it doesn't matter the amount of people who have adopted the currency. The volatility of the currency makes it much harder to depend on as a base medium of exchange. Hyperinflation/deflation have occurred to many currencies in the past and in every case, it makes it very difficult for any economy to exist around them.

Gold is a useful commodity, used in many fields, besides also being a store of value.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:22:12
it is not anti-competitive. anti-competitive would be if they banned all advertising for crypto, except some holdouts.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:23:06


Not necessarily. A lot of pump &amp; dumpers did so without having to pay for advertising.

glad you got appointed the dictator for deciding what's wasteful and what's not.

if you actually believed that, you should short it.

welcome to the world of business. someone has always been around longer than you.
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:36:57




for necessities, yes. if you are thinking of buying a car, but don't really *need* to, you may put it off thinking that your currency will be worth more next year (or the year after). if everyone thinks this, you get a recession.

Austrian has been shown to be useless over and over again in real life. Makes people have boners when they are talking theory, but goes to shit once the rubber hits the road.

you expect people in **this** subreddit to know about history and economics? they are just here for the ride
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:05:07
only took you 3 months to think up that comeback, eh?
@_date: 2018-03-28 14:34:10
it should be used for neither, considering that money isn't free and you'll be paying it off for the next ten years. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:45:28


no, it makes it a bubble. what people are saying about it is what makes it seem so "scammy"
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:45:04

that's what people who have been scammed tell themselves so that they don't face reality
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:52:31
The reality that you've been scammed. Of course I understood your very simple comment.
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:39:14
keep telling yourself that..
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:46:46
pretty sure you are trolling. sometimes it's hard to tell on this sub.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:35:22


No, that's not bullshit. It doesn't matter who is pressuring you. If you hire a contract killer to kill someone, you are responsible.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:05:49
Must be hard to get around, only seeing black and white. Hopefully someone will buy you a pair of those glasses for the colorblind.

Congrats on having that memorabilia, I'm sure you get all the ladies. 
Doesn't justify murdering people.
