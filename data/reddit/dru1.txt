I am also an engineer, and I would like to say that it is extremely costly to design and implement the perfect solution for a problem in a complex system. In this particular setting the impact if the problem is not static, it actually increases each second we sit on our hands. In the end the problem gets so big that users leave. Time is definitely a factor here.

But there is no point discussing this awesome technology, or anything for that matter, because implementing it in "bitcoin core" would make it an altcoin.

*Transparency allows vote buying.*
You agree that this means only the wealthiest people get to decide? The poor people will remain in their situation because they can't raise money for their causes.
*Secrecy allows lying.*
If you cannot provide me with a receipt of what you voted on my incentives for trying to buy that vote is drastically reduced.

Amazing stuff James! The secret voting concept is immensely important for everyone to understand. This is one of my first big aha moments after bitcoin. Thank you for teaching us!

Your car drives you to work. You set the car in "taxi mode" (accepting bitcoin ofc) and the car starts working for you while you're at work. When you're done for the day it automatically comes back and drive you home.

He is commenting on bitcoin related articles at nytimes also.

That wont happen. In taxi mode it will only drive to locations within a specific radius the owner decides, and only after the proper amount of xbt is paid. All doors are locked until the customer payment is received. More specifically: when you order and pay the taxi through the app, you will receive a one-time key you'll use to enter the car.

Let's hope their next film will be how to survive 90 days on fiat.
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:20:49
Yeah, I agree with this. But I'm terrified if we get to a point where a normal transaction costs so much that it is too costly to transact. At this point bitcoin loses its entire purpose and becomes worthless. The transportability aspect of bitcoin is one of it's main "superpowers" and if this power is just slightly diminished we're greatly weakening the peer-to-peer network.
@_date: 2015-05-07 05:39:41
This is what will happen if the block size is not increased: sudden spike inn transactions somewhere inn the world because bitcoin is awesome and is a highly transportable currency. Then the block size gets maxed out, and people cant transact any more. Now bitcoin is worthless and all this was for nothing. GG

Friendly reminder to not use blockchain.info, it's a terrible, faulty, insecure block explorer.
@_date: 2015-08-01 11:09:56
Very simplified: Think of the CPU/GPU as a tool for carving the transactions in stone (why stone? because it's durable, solid, hard to change the text on it etc). The more computational power you have the faster you will complete the stone tablet. 
The person that first completes the stone tablet gets a bitcoin reward. Then all the others have to drop what they were carving on because now those transactions are already on a tablet. So everybody start on a new tablet with new transactions, and the race is on again.

I feel there is a significant difference between these two scenarios:
1. An altcoin starting from scratch with its own chain, and its own miners, and gradually gaining traction until it reaches bigger market cap than Core and starts to "replace" Core as the leading cryptocurrency. If that was what you meant.
2. A software patch on top of an existing chain letting the miners decide if they want to use it or not. If 75% of the miners vote for [REDACTED], Core will be left with 25%. Then the 25% will start hashing on [REDACTED], leaving Core with no miners. That's what I meant with replaced. If the 75% treshold is not reached [REDACTED] will never have been a chain at all, no protocol changing code will ever be executed.

They would rather disagree on agreeing

BashCo is there, that's true, but the other mod, Fred-Stiller-OnAWire is not banning xt posts. So the environment is far better there and also you can see every post that the mods delete. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:10:52
Ok! I disagree with this stance and wanted to check out the bitcoin sub on Voat, but it seems that the sub is run by the same mods as here with the same sensorship rules. Am I right about that?
@_date: 2015-08-07 07:06:22


Agree. And small blocks would create the fee market that miners are so worried about.
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:18:32
Are you aware of the fact that every single altcoin starts off with a clean database, and normally their own miners? Hopefully this doesn't come as a surprise to you. If [REDACTED] started with a clean database and a new mining algorithm I would agree with you(!) and call [REDACTED] an altcoin. The reality is that [REDACTED] is Bitcoin Core's database, using the same miners, with extended functionality (greater transaction rate). I find it fascinating that you mods here call [REDACTED] an altcoin, truly fascinating.
Lastly, there is nothing called Bitcoin anymore. It is Bitcoin Core, if we were to follow the conventions of the mods here.
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:51:57
The premise of an Altcoin, in its traditional meaning, has always been to be an *alternative* coin. The altcoins are alternative to something else. They don't replace anything, they are supplementary to the already existing coins. [REDACTED] has never tried to be an alternative to Core, it tries to replace Core.
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:48:41
Didn't you just "hide" a post about xt?

If it is jinxable it is also unjinxable, but it will require some effort from us!

I am baffled by your ignorance and incompetence. Your comments are fun to read though! If I were to be a dictator on a subreddit you are my role model:)
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:37:15
True. But if the consumer adoption increases, and at some point the price increases, the merchants will decrease their  fiat conversion. When that happens together with reward halving, things will be good I think.

Solutions for all his stupid concerns can be implemented on top of bitcoin by a third party, like a bank...

If bitcoin doesn't scale up then I'm out. 3 transactions per second, wtf. This is ridiculous
