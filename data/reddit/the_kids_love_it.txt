I'm not worried about a double spending attack, I'm saying the problem is either the customer needs to flash the bartender their phone and say "btc sent!", to which the bartender must trust they actually sent the payment, or they need to have the customer wait until the bar receives a confirmation. That's the biggest problem; it's slower and less convenient than cash which is ultimately why BTC isn't a real solution for these transactions.
If someone ran a tab through the night and wanted to pay at the end, I wouldn't see as much of a problem paying with BTC vs. credit card, you would just need to have the bar hold some sort of collateral like a drivers license, as others have stated.

So bitcoin would be great 20 years ago, but is not as good as alternatives today... color me convinced!

He purposefully quoted the section specifically **not** related to bitcoin, instead of the part of his quote specifically mentioning bitcoin. Let's not be naive.

My last experience has been minutes, not seconds. This was months ago, is it that fast now?

Haven't seen any that don't in cities in the US. Even most small town bars do this, although some stick to cash only.

I have no knowledge of this Gox case, but you're so far off the mark on Megaupload it's laughable. 
Did you read the charges filed? I'm sure you didn't if you say there wasn't a case made. To paraphrase it for you, MU knowingly left copyrighted content that was being shared illegally on their servers after DCMA's were received, but claimed to have complied by removing one URL and not others linking to the same offending content. If that wasn't illegal enough, they rewarded uploaders for posting copyrighted media. 
I don't give a shit what your beliefs are on piracy, DCMA, or any legal policies, the facts of the case are MU acted illegally and they got shutdown for it. 
Not for no reason, not because the US government did it for the lulz, not because Hollywood demanded it. If that were the case, every other file sharing website that's been operating legally for years would be shut down. 
TL;DR- if you read documents in full you would have a realistic view on the MU case.

The biggest problem is the one you have no solution for.
How many bars let a stranger open a tab without giving a credit card? That's what you're asking a bartender to do by saying there's no necessity to wait for a confirmation. The main point of OP's post is someone could flash a static image on their phone saying they paid, and in a crowded/fast-paced environment the bar tender is going to have time to check .

Amazon "forced" to accept btc because he sold $130k worth of merchandise in one day is a stupid comment. Amazon had revenues of 167 MILLION per day in 2012. 
Amazon isn't forced to do shit for less than half of one percent of their daily sales. They may want to look into it if they think the growth trends will continue, but they are far from "forced".

The article says based on one company's prediction they will accept Bitcoin, not that they are. Titles in this sub...

Democracy would be letting people upvote what they want. No one elected the mods, let the community decide what's worthy of the front page if it's relevant to btc.

This post should be removed and this user should be put on a watchlist for submitting a scam.
No mention of bitcoin payment as an accepted method of donation in the Liberty PAC website, these coins aren't going anywhere near Ron Paul.

I think it's more facilitating and profiting from a drug market is what got them arrested.

What a terribly misleading title and even sadder people upvote this shit without reading the article.


The title should read "Annonymous Bitcoin Source: ..."

Who's "they"? We already knew Overstock was planning on accepting btc. The quote referenced in this title is


With no mention of a single other retailer accepting btc.
