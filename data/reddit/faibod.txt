Imagine how cool it would be if bitcoin was easily usable as a currency!
@_date: 2019-03-22 21:12:46
Blockport.io for sure

Ummm guys could you explain why Nano isn't closer to the original vision of p2p electronic cash? It's fast free and scalable without a second layer. I know there's a lot of hype etc especially on reddit about it but I really don't see why it isn't the better fit. I'd love to be able to use a crypto to buy coffee AND store value and transact for free. Tell me why I'm wrong or spin up a node!!!

Good old fashioned cash - anonymous and free - use it or lose it!

I thought bitcoin is now destined to be a decentralised and secure store of value rather than a transactional currency?
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:34:13
I think you're thinking of iota with the coordinator. Nano doesn't have a centralized server.

Blockport.io has low fees and great webchat support
@_date: 2019-06-08 09:51:36
Why? Obscurity seems like it'd work pretty well

The username might have helped ��

Yeah that's like saying bitcoin is hacked because of mtgox
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:34:40
Isn't this because people have learned to avoid using btc wherever possible?
@_date: 2018-04-19 00:39:38
Umm, guys Nano is instant and free to transfer... download a wallet from the app store and try it out. Solves all of your problems!

How do you know those people won't do better in the longer term? Trying to time the market is fraught with difficulty so if you really believe in a crypto future the last peak may look insignificant during the next peak.

Are you rejoicing or complaining - it's hard to tell?!

Try bitvavo - you can send sepa transfers in euros (Free with a revolut card for example) and it's overall similar in price to coinbase.

I'm amazed at how far behind US banking is compared to Europe! We are accustomed to instant app based online banking with no fees and people are routinely paying in stores using our phones or a card via contactless nfc tech. International transfers remain expensive though.

Does this settle in real bitcoin or just paper trading?
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:00:26
Actually no, if I transfer money using my online bank account, the recipient can usually withdraw it immediately (although occasionally it can take up to 2 hours).
