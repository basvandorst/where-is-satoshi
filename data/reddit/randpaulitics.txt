Yes but BitInstant was anonymous. That's why they shut it down. And why the "ATMS" come with all these ridiculous identification requirements. 
I wouldn't be surprised if they were tracking specific Bitcoins to specific idenities but at the very least a Coinbase account irretrievably links you to Bitcoin in the eyes of the NSA.
One can still meet up with a LocalBitCoins' seller and purchase with cash but most people really don't want to do that or they are in a rural area (plus there is a relatively large premium).

Be proactive. Find a charity such as this -  - and send them this link:  - promising to make a donation if they accept it
easy setup, no processing fee for registered non-profits

I doubt any of the company's mentioned will ever incorporate any altcoin. That would just give credence to the claim that Bitcoin is "inflationary" and hurt the whole ecosystem. Bitcoin or bust IMO.

Yeah I don't understand why they have the wallet address hidden away in the account settings page.
Also I think Bitpay is based in Atlanta.

Maybe purse.io if you don't mind some turnaround time

Yeah you're right but it sounds like it could be a word. Wonder what they did with all that whale sperm?

No, I meant it along the lines of the word "irretrievable", like once they know you like cryptos you can never get total anonymity back, but upon some quick Googling it seems "irretrievably" isn't actually a word lol.

The ether idiots are apparently trying to destroy crypto by dumping thousands of btc on the market and causing panic sells. Screw them and their scam.
