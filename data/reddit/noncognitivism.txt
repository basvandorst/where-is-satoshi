The exchanges would need to be working together. If one moves the price down independently, they would almost certainly lose money. Your assertion is that they would be hoping people sell low, but instead people would buy. It would happen immediately, because the number of bots watching all sites would be all over sell orders that are lower on one site.
If the exchanges are working together (at least the major exchanges), it would be incredibly hard to sustain. With halving day being only 95 weeks away or less, and corporate acceptance growing at a fast pace, the demand for bitcoins is still relatively high.
It hasn't even come close to true public acceptance yet. Any price manipulation is being done short term in hopes of scaring weak investors into unloading at a loss. There is no reason to believe it is being done falsely by the exchanges themselves though. 
People buy and sell bitcoins every day for the price shown at the exchange. Those transactions aren't fake.

There is no saying what the market will do in three months time though. Also, 30,000 bitcoins is a fairly significant amount. It's almost a quarter of one percent of the total market. That's huge, in a market like bitcoin.

Yeah, just use a log scale so that the difference from $100 to $10,000 is the same visually as the difference from $1 to $100. I'm all for bitcoin, and believe the price will go up from here, but using this log scale is misleading.
If you continue that scale out, we would be at $20,000+ in just 2 more years, and over $1 million in 5 years.

@_date: 2014-07-02 19:31:23
Okay, as far as broad terminology it is technically correct to say "under market value", but for the sake of considering "market value" what it really is and not some arbitrary number tied to a zero depth market value, I think it makes more sense. I think if people are going to say "under market value" for a significant number of coins, they should say "under current market value"
Saying the whole set of 27 thousand bitcoins sold for under market value implies to many that they were sold for overall less than they could be sold for at market. That's the whole point of saying it, and it's inaccurate.

They sent me to collections and I told the collection agency that it is a fraudulent debt. I called to notify PayPal at the first suspicion of possibly dealing with a chargeback scammer. I informed the agent that I was selling Bitcoins, and that the user's email was strikingly similar to another user who had done a chargeback (which Paypal sided in my favor on).
I was told that so long as I was conducting business in good faith, that my funds were **guaranteed** and that I had absolutely nothing to worry about.
Now my account is negative $1300, AND there was a positive $700 when it all started. Paypal owes me money, fuck them if they think they're going to bully me into paying for their poor customer service.

If I tell someone their $2000 is guaranteed through my service and then I lose their $2000? Yes. I would eat the loss. And so should Paypal.
Paypal makes billions of dollars, so don't fucking tell me that it wouldn't be fair for them to eat the $2k after lying to a customer. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 02:35:00
Is it possible to get your coins out of the exchange though? The trade volume is astonishingly low for such cheap coins.
@_date: 2014-02-22 20:36:52


I'm sure you read a 20 page paper every time you sign up somewhere. I spoke with a representative who lied to me about my safety in this market. That is reason enough for me to say that Paypal is at fault. If I tell one of my customers a lie, in good business, I have to make good on whatever I told them.
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:08:10


That's all I hear. Yes, it would be dumb as shit for them to dump it all at one or two exchanges and get raped on the price, but if they haven't been a part of the game, they might not have fully realized what they were doing. Just that they were cashing in way more than they ever dreamed of.
That, or this person has hundreds of thousands of BTC, and is trying to get even more by making a massive scare on the charts.
I might actually guess the latter. btc-e is fairly popular, so for there to be that thin of a gap between the current price and $102, I would think this person sold during that time intentionally.
43,000 LTC sold during the same hour, for a low price of .02461 - Still think it was an obvious mistake?

If someone buys something with 2 BTC and then returns it a week later, I'm going to refund 2 BTC, not 4 BTC. So at the end of the scenario you still have 10 BTC.

@_date: 2014-02-23 04:41:42
If I lie to a customer, that may cost me money. Given Paypal's annual earnings, $2k is not very much to lose in exchange for having a customer (who has been a customer for nearly a decade, mind you) who is happy that the mistake was taken care of, and is ready to suggest Paypal to his friends and family.
Instead, they are keeping the $2k, but losing multiple long-term customers.

I don't even think the coins were sold under market value. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure if the government had dumped them at a bunch of exchanges they would have knocked the price down lower than the high bid.

But Circle is free so what did you need to pay that $5/mo for, again?
You don't have to pay $5 to the credit union, either, and your funds are still insured, if something were to happen to the credit union itself. The $5 is for additional theft protection such as stolen identity scenarios. Circle isn't going to reimburse your bitcoins if someone gains access to only your account and withdraws them.

No, you are right. Log charts are good for showing the entire several years though. They become less useful when trying to show a short term.
