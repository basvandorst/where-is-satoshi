Tomorrow at around 7am EDT in the US, a huge ball of hydrogen will appear on the eastern horizon.
Eight minutes later, photons escaping from this ball will impinge the earth's atmosphere, creating a blue tint from scattering by atmospheric molecules.
The ball will rise in the sky, bathing the earth in infrared radiation, a certain portion of which will be trapped by carbon emissions resulting from massive cryptocurrency mining.
About 10 hours after its appearance, the hydrogen ball will dip below the western horizon, throwing the environment into darkness, cold, and fear.
The day after tomorrow - who knows?

Utilities and utility commissions have authority in this matter.  Utilities are not going to connect electrical loads larger than they can generate and distribute to.    Utilities plan several years ahead.  When they see their base load increasing, and see large power demand customers come on line, they will ask the utility commission for rate tariffs that disincentivize large power customers by increasing per kW demand charges and increasing time of use energy charges.  The cost of electricity will rise to a point where mining is not profitable in those areas, and some mining farms will shut down (or construct their own solar-plus-storage facilities).  Mining difficulty will adjust to the decreased hashrates, and block generation will continue at lower rates of electricity consumption.

But holding out for 1800USD instead shows you are a man of principle.
BTW, the last 24hrs of 226-byte transactions (about 390k TX) could have been had for $5 each, on average.  People choosing to pay more than 3x either have an urgency that makes the fee worth it, or respect the ROI, or love the miners, or have not completed their education.

One viewpoint that will make fees look less outrageous to persons who have seen their BTC rise many fold in USD value in recent times:
Anyone moving bitcoin that has been in place longer than a month has realized 100% gains.  For many users, those gains outweigh the typical fee many fold.
If one considers the transaction fee as the cost of making the gain, the ROI is many, many fold.

Can't be done.  Expect to pay at least 10USD for a single transaction.  Decide for yourself what percentage fee is acceptable to you.   Also decide for yourself if a 10USD transaction fee is tolerable when considered in the light that you have gained many multiples of your original BTC purchase over the years.  Call the 10USD a transaction fee, or call it a gift to the miners for keeping the system going, or call it a 10-cent transaction fee that has gone up the same as your investment.
Go here to estimate a proper fee - 
Look for the lowest sat/byte fee with a 0-block delay in confirmation expectation.  That is 470 sats/byte right now, about 15USD.  Fees a little lower than that will still go through in a timely manner. Fees significantly lower than that might not go through today.
Fees with the longest expected delays indicate transactions submitted by the Vermen.

A ponzi scheme is a centralized fraud.  It is perpetrated by a collector of investment funds, based on promises of high dividend returns to the investors.  Defrauded investors own no assets, but instead are paid periodic dividends which originate from the funds of later investors.  The ponzi scheme collapses when the influx of new investors slows or stops, and when investors try to withdraw their capital.
Bitcoin investors are able to control their own private keys.  They purchase the asset from each other, not from a central figure, and they control the asset themselves.  They can realize profits during any price rise and keep all or some of their original capital.  By controlling their own private keys, they never relinquish the asset.  As of this posting, a key-holding purchaser/hodler of bitcoin at any price below 14,000 over the last ten years has had access to a substantial ROI while maintaining personal control and ownership of 100% of their capital.
While many people may lose money investing in bitcoin, it will not be the result of fraud.  It will be the result of them selling their asset at a lower price than what they paid.
Investors who profit in bitcoin are not perpetrating a fraud.  They are selling their asset at a price higher than what they paid.
People who leave their bitcoin on exchanges and give control of access to their capital to the exchanges are not victims of a ponzi scheme.  They are lazy or uninformed.  These investors are poor custodians of the assets they have purchased.
A man who gives his cash wallet for safekeeping to an astronaut on the ISS, expecting to get 24/7 access to his cash, is not the victim of a ponzi scheme.

During any ~10-minute period, the necessary transaction fee (in sats/byte) to get into the next block is the lowest of the approximately 2500 highest priced (in sats/per byte transaction fee) transactions residing in the mempool.
That threshold can be veiwed at earn.com (bitcoin fees), and changes fairly rapidly depending on the number of users trying to send legitimate transactions (looking at you, Vermen), and how important it is to the ~2500 most impatient users to get into the next block.
The threshold is a function of demand for blockspace, and a function of ability and willingness to pay more than transaction  (approximately) in the waiting list.  
It will go down when demand for blockspace subsides, and as the percentage of Segwit transactions goes up.
Go to fork.lol and view the Tx/Tx fees tab to see bitcoin transaction fees rise and fall over time.

Enemies are trying to destroy BTC by loading the mempool with spam transactions with low fees.  
The effect is psychological, as BTC transactors believe they have to pay exorbitant fees to get into the next block.  
The necessary fee at any time depends on your desired transaction schedule, and fee data available from sites like 
Next block?  pay a top-2500 fee.
Next hour?  pay a top-15000 fee.
Next 24 hours?  pay a top-380,000 tee.
The attack/spam transactions are below the top-380,000 fee 99% of the time.  They have no effect on required fees.  They simply make the mempool look overstuffed.
With the limited blocksize in bitcoin, coffee drinkers are competing with exchanges/payment processors for blockspace.  The former are willing to pay a 20-cent fee for their 8USD latte.   The latter are willing to pay 50USD fees for their 100kUSD bulk buy/sells.
Fees are determined by the pocket depth of the richest buyers.  Confirmation times are determined by the greed of the miners.

Same reason diamonds cost so much.   High demand for a limited supply (blockspace.)  In both cases, supply is held down purposely.  In the case of diamonds, it's to maximize profits.  In the case of bitcoin, it's purportedly to maximize the number and distribution of network nodes.  Many people don't buy that argument, and instead believe bitcoin blockspace is held down for a variety of reasons ranging from nefarious practices by bitcoin developers whose employers stand to profit from small blocks, to hypnotic sociopathic mind control by certain egomaniacal developers over others, to fear by certain developers of losing control of what they think is their baby.

Bitcoin is not the only option for global payments.  It presently has the most network security in place.  That can change.  Contrary to prevailing clarion (not opinon), the death of bitcoin will not be the death of cryptocurrencies.  Only elitists and narcissists believe that.  In fact, thousands of daily transactions take place on, and millions of investment dollars flow into, cryptocurrencies not named BTC.  Nothing will change that.  Unless the "silent majority" in crypto takes back the microphone from the two antagonists, the headlines will ignore such facts as:  over 50% of miner signalling is for "leave it as it is".  No blocksize change, no malleability fix, etc.  Let us not embrace the false dichotomy presently dominating the headlines.  Irrespective of any individual opinion or emotion, the voices of 6000 network participants and 300,000 daily transactors aggregate to position the bitcoin rudder.  Money should not respond to politics. It should respond to participants.  Totalitarianism depends on tribal animosity preventing effective resistance to a common enemy.  Ending the scaling impasse requires unity.  Destructive forces don't care what labels or players or tools are employed - they only work in the pursuit of destruction.

I did my own math with my own assumptions and came up with this:
One TX costs 7USD in electricity.
One TX pays 44USD in subsidy and fees.
600% markup is nice.
If per TX electricity costs (hashpower) triple, that's still 100% markup at today's BTC price, at least until the next subsidy halvening.  Seems like enough incentive to stay in the mining business.
When someone complains about TX fees, ask them who should pay for the electricity - the user or the miner.

A single BTC TX costs abut 7USD in electricity.  A typical 12,000 annual kWh house uses 240 kWh in a week, about 24 to 36 USD. 
For his 7USD spent, the miner gets about 44USD in return in subsidy and fees - a 500% ROI.
For the 7USD the homeowner spends on electricity for two or three days to watch TV, wash his clothes, heat his house and water, and refrigerate his food, the homeowner gets 0 ROI.
Miners are wiser users of electricity than homeowners.

If a low-fee transaction is included in a block, this lowers the average transaction fee.
If the fee you include is 1 cent higher than the fee paid by the spam, you will get in the block before the spam.
In the model of a single block, a miner takes the 2500 TX with the highest fees to make a block.  If a spam transaction comes in with fee ranking 2501, it has no effect on the average fee.  In the model of a single hour, the miners take the 15k TX with the highest fees to make six blocks.  If a transaction comes in with fee ranking 150001, it has no effect on the average fee.  In the model of a single year ......

I'm probably misunderstanding, but it sounds like you're saying the covert form prevents SEGWIT from being implemented in a technical way.  Is that true, or does the covert form just disincentivize a large miner from signalling SEGWIT because SEGWIT breaks the covert form?
"disincentivizing" is more accurate than "blocking", IMO.  "Blocking"  implies something can't technically be done, IMO.  "Blocking" shares syntactical DNA with "attack", whereas "disincentivizing" does not.
