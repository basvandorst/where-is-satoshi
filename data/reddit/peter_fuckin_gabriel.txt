What about the energy needed to transport and store gold vs bitcoin?

I asked Gustin in SF to take BTC - here's what they said.
As for payment, we're probably a little ways away form accepting Bitcoin. We don't even accept PayPal at the moment. We will most likely get to other payment options down the line, but for now, we're sticking with credit/debit cards. The request has definitely been passed onto our product team. Thanks for the suggestion.

I think Ver will eventually come back to the good side, just like Vader at the end of Jedi.

I am too!  Order up :)

Vader KILLED NEARLY ALL THE JEDI.  He slaughtered YOUNGLINGS.  Ver is no Vader.  He wishes he was, but he's not.

never good to try and catch a falling knife, but not a bad time to dollar cost in I suppose.  BTC is still awesome, in spite of these selloffs.  Just Hold.

@_date: 2019-01-11 19:11:09
Gonna be a no from me, dogg.

Is there a way to see how active a community it is?  For example, how many of us 1M readers post, or comment?

Your lightning channel is good, and you should feel good.
