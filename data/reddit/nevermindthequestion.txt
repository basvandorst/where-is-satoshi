They could collude and just pocket the BTC instead of sending it where they're supposed to.
However, the Rootstock team came up with a proposed fork that could be done to Bitcoin so that the federation isn't required at all.

All I have to say about Wright is that he potentially had a good idea which can be developed.
If you watch the video closely, once Wright makes it clear that he's talking about adding script opcodes, Nick no longer disagrees with Wright, but he scoffs at him and tells him to write a paper explaining it instead.  I'm working on this idea.
BTW, satoshi recently denied being Wright.
And no, I'm not Wright

Hi again
All Turing complete languages are equivalent in the sense that you can write a program that does the same thing (despite having different code) in any of the languages.  It might just be easier to write in one language vs another.
Anything that can be done with Ethereum (including things that can be done with loops, such as your WST) can be done with Bitcoin.  And if it doesn't require loops in Ethereum, it doesn't require loops in Bitcoin either.  For instance, subcurrencies were one of the first things implemented in Bitcoin (colored coins).
Unfortunately, I don't actually know FORTH, so I don't know how to write any of the more useful things that you could do with loops.
Should we continue this conversation over email?

So if I understand the the white paper correctly, they're achieving the 2-way peg by depositing BTC into a multisig account that's owned by Rootstock admins.  Whenever the BTC is deposited into this address, RSK of the same denomination is created, and whenever someone wants to take BTC out, RSK is destroyed and the admins promise to honor their agreement to send the BTC to the proper location.  Sounds a bit risky.
The paper says that the admins will be chosen among "trusted members of the global community" such as university presidents.  Sounds like that'll be difficult and will take a while.  I wish them luck in this process.
@_date: 2015-12-10 12:42:09
Interesting find thank you.  But this isn't the same as FORTH's Return stack.  It's a 2nd data stack
@_date: 2015-12-10 04:42:19
You could research the language FORTH.
I just started a discussion on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list about this, so there isn't much info yet.

I'm sorry.  I can't tell what that python code is supposed to be showing.
I was pretty sure I originally encountered the concept of a Native Extension in your writing, and you said it was the reason you were originally looking for a functional language to base the EVM on.  Your plan was to make it that functions that were called a lot could be given their own opcodes, which would reduce their gas cost.
The idea is that any function, once defined, can both be reused and optimized down to code native to the machine that the VM is running on.

Just wondering, but how much does it cost to spam the network for an hour?  Because judging by  it only seems to be ~$200/hr
@_date: 2016-03-12 21:37:52
Maybe someone should register SwissBankAccountInYourPocket.com?
@_date: 2016-03-16 01:00:00
True.  I removed that part of my post.
Added another though:  How much does this attack cost/hour in fees?  It seems to only be ~$200/hr at most.
@_date: 2016-03-19 01:35:32
That only makes sense if everyone gets their money through hourly wages.
@_date: 2016-03-16 01:07:52
Wow, that's tiny.  Almost anyone could do that.
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:56:08
It gives you a definition by John Nash of a type of money that has never existed, and IMO is not ideal at all
@_date: 2016-03-07 23:23:54
Anyway, if you're interested in this "ideal" money, talk to the MakerDAO people.  They're trying to make it happen
@_date: 2016-03-07 23:22:39
Who said I ignored your past several months of ramblings?
John Nash said that ideal money would track a basket of goods like the CPI.
He never, to my knowledge, justified why this type of money would be ideal (nor did he say where the inflation/deflation, which is necessary for this type of currency, would go).  He did, however, show that it would have some interesting macroeconomic equations.

You run parallel on a single thread.
Wut? That's impossible.


No, on the best computers, you have ~2^10
I suggest you learn how computers work.  You seem veeery confused.
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:23:27
Parallel processing on a single thread doesn't allow you to compute two different things at the same time...  It does one after the other while hiding the back and forth shifting from the user and programmer.
Seriously.  Learn about computers before you panic that they don't work right.
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:11:50
Except that you don't have 2^n independent states to work with on a quantum computer.  There's dependence between them and there's a measurement protocol that you need to take account of.  Try to write a quantum algorithm to solve an NP-complete problem.  I've tried it.  You literally get 0 speed up.  Don't just trust me.  Try it.
Now, on the other hand, a programmable analog computer can solve NP complete problems in constant time.  Given a Peg Board (pegs with strings attached between them), you can solve SAT by setting up an appropriate graph on the peg board and pulling on a few pegs.
However, the theory of analog computation (more specifically, computation over the algebraic closure of the booleans) hasn't been worked out yet.  I've actually spend the past week working on it, attempting to find a way to model the "peg board" with it.

The only way to brute force quickly is by either spawning a huge number of threads or computing very quickly.  A quantum processor can't do that any better than a classical processor.  You might as well be freaking out about many-core processors and super computers.  However, the best many-core processors on the market currently have ~1000 cores, which, at ~1GHz each, isn't nearly fast enough to brute force a single private key in less than 1000 years.
@_date: 2016-06-15 10:25:31
Unfortunately, I've had a really hard time finding much.  But some other methods of analog computing are annealing (waiting for glasses to settle down), the surfaces of bubbles, and the movements of slime molds, all of which can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time (slime molds are even thought to be able to solve NP-hard problems, which are harder than NP-complete, in polynomial time).  Also, fluid computers can solve many difficult differential equations.
Let me know if you find anything about modeling these algebraically, since I'm trying find a way to model them with the algebraic closure of the booleans.

There's currently 1 person in the investing UNU.  So... you and one other guy decided that the price would go to $10,000?
@_date: 2016-06-14 23:46:50
I'm well aware of how this works.
Now, tell me approximately how many threads are needed to brute force a single 128 bit private key within a year at 4GHz/thread.
And then tell me how many times the world GDP it would cost you to buy such an array of computers.
If you're extra daring, tell me how many times the volume of the earth such an array of computers would occupy.
@_date: 2016-06-14 13:51:13
Quantum computers can only break certain types of classical encryption.  Lamport Signatures, for instance, can be used.

It's very interesting to note that Finance and Physics are related by the Wick rotation, with Energy functioning as the analog of money.

It's called IBM's ADEPT division.
Though it's unclear which of the top holders is IBM.  They either own 4, 3, or 1 million Ether.
If they owned any more than 4 million, it would literally cause securities issues with PoS, which IBM is planning for Ethereum.
@_date: 2015-09-12 11:12:29
Check out Ethereum.  There's a prediction market.  They're building a stock market.  They're making an auditing program for certificates of physical assets like gold.  And more.  (For instance, you can put your will on Ethereum)
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:55:29
LTC has the same vulnerability dude.  In fact, because of LTC's price, the attack is cheaper.  You need a coin that implements GHOST (3-15 second block time at no cost to security) to make this attack unfeasible.
@_date: 2015-09-07 20:45:58
You know that Counterparty stopped development, right?  Also, that would reduce Ethereum's block speed by a factor of 50.
Edit:  Not to forget to mention that Counterparty cannot cause trades of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-08 02:50:15
lol.  You think I sold it for FIAT?  Are you crazy?  There's going to be a stock market crash soon!  Cryptocurrencies are about to rise like crazy when rich people realize it's the only thing left to invest in!
You do realize that the fiat prices of all alt coins go up and down with Bitcoin, right?

Anything that can be copied doesn't work
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:26:40
Did you catch the announcement that all but a few developers moved onto a project called Symbiont that works on either Counterparty or Ethereum?
Also, you may have missed my edit, which says that Counterparty cannot cause trades of Bitcoin, which means that Counterparty is far less featured.  For instance, no Bitcoin valued futures market is possible.  No Bitcoin wills.  No prediction markets.  No web3.0 possibility.

You're using the wrong cryptocurrency for that kind of stuff.  What you're talking about is the realm of smart contracts.

The only one technologically capable of providing people with secure democracy, and the only that IBM bought 3 million units of and is actively working on improving, of course.  Do some research.

You ever read the CryptoAnarchist manifesto or any other literature by Tim May and his friends?  (The reason research on Bitcoin was first started in the early 90s)  Judging by IBM's current research into urban planning and maintenance and their involvement in ethereum, they seem to be trying to start a franchise government.  As outlined by the crypto anarchists, smart contracts are absolutely necessary for that.
Bitcoin wasn't made so that people could get rich.  It was made so that franchise governments could happen.

Ah.  Good catch.  Is charging a txfee/tx instead of group of txs all it takes?
Dude, I was a holder for 4 years, but I have 0 faith in BTC as a technology anymore.  There hasn't been a single major change to the protocol since its release 6 years ago!  Meanwhile, other coins have fixed major bugs and improved things like block speed without sacrificing security!
@_date: 2015-09-08 12:49:38
Funny.. You seem very confused.  First, I suggest you figure out which coin IBM is endorsing and doing R&amp;D on.
@_date: 2015-09-12 11:16:16
Unrelated, IBM owns millions of ether and is actively doing R&amp;D on improving Ethereum.

Hello Mr. Voorhees,
In order for Bitcoin to hit $1 million, it will have to be used very frequently.
I'm under the impression that mining will be so centralized at that point that there won't be any pressure for the fee to change much.  Considering how frequently the blockchain would be used, you wouldn't be able to reasonably transact without paying a sizable fee.
If that's the case, you'd maybe be able to transact $100 at a time, but you wouldn't be able to reasonably transact $0.05 like today.
Do you see any solution to this?
@_date: 2015-10-30 22:36:56
If Bitcoin hits $1 million, then the transaction fee will mean that you can't reasonably trade less than $5,000 worth at a time
