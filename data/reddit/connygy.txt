"Unemployment compensation" according to the local lowest life standard. I would very like to pay the taxes for that. Do nothing is sometimes better than do too much.  They should spend more time with family instead of working so hard for our money.

Ah!!! I listen obviously too much Sadhguru's preach. Yes, he uses a lot of "isn't it"!   (￣▽￣)\~\*

Totally agree with you. Anyone with a little awareness should know, the fiat money system should be abandoned.

Thanks very much for the answer, but what is good on bitstamp? Sorry, I am a very beginner, I don't know which features are important for a platform...

Danke! Aber Mann muss einen Konto bei [fidor.de]( aufmachen. Muss man viele Papier dort senden oder persönlich hingehen?

Wow, cool! Am I wrong??? kraken has much lower Transaction fee!!! Bitpandas has 1.49% for buy und 1.29% for sell!!! But kraken has 0.26% for buyer and 0.16% for sell. It is nearly 10 times fee!!!

Hi Dec, thanks very much for the answer. I will try it. 
The day before yesterday, I sent also the question to your support, but the answer I got, somehow like from a robot, he didn't understand my question and send an unrelated answer. I was very very disappointed, so I replied to the email again, asked the question again. Finally, I got a human answer.
Anyway, thanks very much, you answered me here, so that I know bitpanda is not run by a robot.  :D

Thanks very much! I just checked the coinbase pro.  (Without pro, the fees are very high 1.49% buy and taker, make no sense and kranken is much better)
But can "coinbase pro" be registered as normal user in germany?
Will they accept the sepa from german bank?

Hi exab, thanks!  It looks like not many people know it, isn't it? Even this is a basic question?
@_date: 2019-05-02 22:53:25
But how is the verification process? Bitpanda and Kraken both need the personal verification in Germany. Will coinbase also do it for European customers?

Thanks, I think I should go there, the basic is important. :D
