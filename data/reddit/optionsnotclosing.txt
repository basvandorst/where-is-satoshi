I don't think anyone is foolish enough to store bitcoin on an unsecured wallet . maybe in 2010-2013 a lto of people did, but not anymore. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:28:51
and it drops again, drat

I tired to replicate this by importing a private key into electrum. the config does not contain private keys
it gives the path to the wallets and recent opened wallets

amazing how quickly this drops
like all the bids get puled out and it drops $200 like nothing 
altcoins such as litecoin and dash are more stable   
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:43:17
crapcoin..litecoin and dash are better
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:56:20
lol that is not the actual coin 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:48:47
everything crashing at once..all alts and bitcoin..what a joke

Down is down. Funny how some people try to rationalize away what is obvious 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:17:19
fuck fuck fuck 
stop falling
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:14:12
the selling is fuckign relentless. no bounces 
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:47:09
so a 2000 point crash in just 5 days is not enough?
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:51:57
Nope. no big buyers. Every uptick is being sold

It's annoying how the same stuff stays on the front page for 24 hours, long after people stopped clicking or commenting on it. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:49:35
it actually goes down more than up. it's just that the up moves are clustered and higher but the down moves are longer

Bitcoin always falls when people get most excited 
@_date: 2018-02-25 13:48:26
but what about the lunar cycle? You got to include that too
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:50:24
There is literally no one buying. It's just people selling 10+ coins into every uptick , with the occasional small buyer.
Someone needs to come in and do multiple 50+ batch buy orders to get it above 10000 again like it did the past bounces
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:15:50
It is now 60% off the high. This makes it almost as bad as the 2013-2014 selloff
