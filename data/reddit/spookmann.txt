Am I correct in thinking that, in the short term, LN adoption will make things slightly worse in terms of load?  Until there are a lot of efficient centralised hubs, LN will contain a lot of single-use channels which will further load the mempool?

Nice theory.  :)  But no, if you literally owned *all* the mined gold, it would be worthless.  
Gold has value because it can be traded, and used for jewellery and for electronic manufacturing.  If you held *all* the gold and never released it, then it has no value.  It just a thing that takes up storage space.

Heh.  Were you around in the early days of the internet?  I think perhaps not.
I was, and I remember the "original" technologies from when I first used email and accessed remote computers.  Let me remind you what the original technologies were: X.25, Dial-Up, FTP, Gopher, Telnet, Mosaic, and CGI, HTTP, HTML, and Java.
Yes, HTTP survived, and HTML.  But many of the original early technologies were replaced.  Flash came along, and then died.
Being present at the start of things is no guarantee of long-term survival.  The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.

RE: Marx.  I'm quite happy to concede that communism/socialism can start with the greatest of ideals.  But I've yet to see it turn to anything other than corruption and poverty.  [Free-market can happily go the same way too.]
RE: Sweden.  I agree, Sweden is underlaid with a free-market economy.  It's fundamentally capitalist (which I consider to be a good thing) and is overlaid with "socialist" protections.  Much the same as UK, NZ, Australia, most of Europe... just differing in degree.
People arguing against "socialism" insist that "socialism" is black or white.  They won't let you talk about "socialist policies" on top of a capitalist backdrop.  They will say "Socialism means the state owns everything and controls your life!"  But that's bullshit.  All governments mix both capitalism and socialism.  If your country has mandatory taxes, police, judges, a shared health system (even if it's crappy), fire departments, patent office, education, shared sanitary systems, and any sort of economic management... those are all elements of socialism.  And if you can own property, you have capitalism.  It's a mix.

Personally, I've never seen a socialist government, let alone a communist one.
I've seen plenty of corrupt dictatorships masquerading as communism or socialism.  Closest I've seen to real-world "socialism" is mixed-model governments like Sweden which are a pragmatic blend of free-market fundamentals to encourage business activity, with social balancing factors to try and keep most citizens health, educated, and safe.

Actually, it proves that you can't mix linear and exponential values.  Consider a price of 1000 that goes up to 2000 then comes back down again.  It's exactly where it started of course.  Zero gain.
But this chart would say 1000-&gt;2000 = +100%.  2000-&gt;1000 = -50%, a NET GAIN OF 50%!
The chart is a lie.

Of the 550 currencies here, less than 200 of them actually died.  The vast majority were simply replaced or even renamed.  The Tonga Pound Sterling didn't fail -- it was simply replaced by the paʻanga when Tonga declared independent.  The Connecticut Dollar didn't fail -- it was merged into the USD when the USD was created.
What's more, the list has to go back nearly 1,000 years to find 150 failed currencies.  Meanwhile, 276 (nearly half) of the ICOs launched in 2017 had failed by Feb 2018.  Them's not good odds.

Defendant A conducted 335 remittance transactions, each valued at less than $10,000, to China and Hong Kong. The total value of the transactions was $3,088,311. Defendant A received a fee for each transaction conducted and collected approximately $30,000 for these activities. The funds were provided to Defendant A by his employer. The court found that Defendant A believed that the funds were remitted overseas in order to avoid paying tax in Australia and were not the proceeds of crime. Defendant A was sentenced to five and a half years' imprisonment in 2007.*

Seriously?  Communist vindictiveness?
a) This is NOT on a whim.  b) This is 100% capitalism.
Remember, you can dispute a transaction any time you like.  The bank can get left out of pocket.
Remember, when you buy with a credit card, you're buying something with the bank's money, and promising to pay them back.  They have the right to be careful when you're spending their money.
The bank has every incentive to process your purchase!  They get a 2% cut.  Banks don't just randomly censor shit.  They don't give a fuck what you buy unless a) it's illegal and the bank can be liable, or b) the transaction looks like it might be fraud and the bank can get left out of pocket.
So, the bank's computer program thought that this was a high-risk transaction.  It's a program.  It had a reason for doing this.  Perhaps credit card thieves had been using stolen cards to buy printers.  Perhaps the website got hacked.  We don't know.  But there was a reason.

Hey, OP.  A bit of googling seems to suggest that Prusa has been having a bit of a fight with PayPal and Credit Cards over the past few years.
It seems that Prusa has a nasty habit of charging immediately for products, even when it's a pre-order and they haven't actually got a product to ship.
I'm guessing that this is a breach of terms, and the credit cards companies are starting to get a bit shitty about it.
Remember, you're asking your credit card company to buy the printer for you, and then you'll pay them back!  Except of course that you can dispute the charge and then your CC company has to swallow the loss.
I haven't seen any evidence to suggest that this is "censorship".  The banks don't give a fuck what you buy, as long as it's legal, and not a risk for them.  They want that sweet 2% margin!  :)

Of course not.  There's a 1.5-3% fee associated with that.  In return for taking that percentage, the CC company will:
* Authenticate the parties involved.
* Lend you the money for the purchase up to 45 days for zero interest.
* Perform an international banking transaction from you, to your bank, to retailer's bank, to the retailer.
* Provide insurance and investigation to keep fraud levels low.
* Comply with the regulatory authorities money laundering and other laws.
For 99% of people, that represents a very satisfactory arrangement.
People like you who are prepared to perform their own regulatory interactions, their own authentication, live without insurance, fraud checks, credit facilities, and be their own international agent and assume all risks are few and far between, but you do exist (for whatever reasons).
But you're not the "norm", and for that reason peer-based currencies will never dominate the mainstream.

Don't get me wrong, I admire your faith in BTC!  But I cannot support your argument.
Firstly, oil and land have never been currency.
Secondly, gold used to be currency, but it turned out that tying gold to currency was unsustainable.
Thirdly, back when land was held by a small number of people it was called feudalism or monarchism, and the redistribution process involved a nifty device called the guillotine - I don't think bitcoin hodlers want to look to that particular historic example for inspiration!
Fourthly, oil and land are desired for their intrinsic properties.  Gold is also vital for manufacturing of modern computers. 
Fifthly, these assets are physically constrained.  Cryptocurrencies are not -- it takes 10 minutes to create a new one on  
99.99% of people have fiat, but they don't have bitcoin.  So they're never going to support replacing fiat with something they don't have.
The general masses might perhaps support a system where a new cryptocurrency (not bitcoin) is created by some leading authority and everybody gets given 10,000 units just for being alive.  But the rich lobbyists won't support that, so that's never going to happen.
I agree with the poster.  At this time there is no obvious viable path by which BitCoin (specifically) can become the single national or global mainstream replacement for the current government managed currencies.  There are potential viable paths by which another non-BTC CC could become widely adopted, but for BitCoin?  No.

And this is actually by design.
An investment does its job if it a) pays a dividend (like a property that you rent out), or b) holds long term value in comparison with other things (like gold or artwork).
A currency's role is different.  It's job is to be spent and transferred between people, regularly.  If currency gained in value in real terms by 2% every year, more people would just save it instead of spending it.   Nobody spending, no jobs, no business, no income, no spending, and... economic collapse.
Most modern reserve banks have the goal of maintaining a small level of inflation, 1-3% is typical.  This encourages people to spend money instead of just hodling it, and the economy runs smoothly.
Long-lasting deflation is actually a bad thing for money.
So the question is, is Bitcoin a currency that people want to spend day-to-day, or is it an investment that you acquire and sell later?

Then I don't think you're looking hard enough.  The reasons for BTC adoption have changed drastically over the lifetime of the technology, and this entire thread is about the further changing of the reasons.  
At the start, Bitcoin was adopted by a small number of people directly involved in the creation of the technology.  They knew exactly what the system did, they wrote it, and they acquired bitcoins because it was something they themselves created.  Idealists, and compulsive creators.
Then some of their tech-savvy, future-looking friends jumped on-board just for fun, and because it didn't cost anything.  They joined because it was cool.  They paid 10,000 bitcoin for two pizzas and didn't think of the future, it was just a fun game.  "Wow Man, we're living in the future!"
The early investors came on board.  The first of the hodlers.  They saw a gradual creep up in the curve, saw BTC as the only crypto-currency in the world, and they began to dream of lambos.
Organised, anonymous miners came on board.  They invested in graphics cards, and purchased power at discount rates from hydro-power companies in China.
The corporate investors joined the game.  A little slower than the individuals, but backed by enough money to start working the pump-and-dumps.
The IT guy from the office jumped in at $12k.  Then when CNN Money featured BTC, the moms and pops jumped in too late and paid $18k.
That's how we got from 0% of the world on bitcoin all the way to 0.002%.  But you can't take that a graph that goes from 0% - 0.002%, wave your hand, and say "and the same mathematics and market forces will obviously take us to 100%".  
All of the impetus for BTC growth has come from the above groups, which have now clearly run out of energy.  Most of these guys are involved because they saw BTC as a volatile investment asset, they did not at all see it as a stable, convenient, representative currency for day-to-day exchange.
In order to reach global penetration as a universally accepted currency, BTC now requires a complete shift of paradigm, and the engagement of an entirely new sector of society (i.e. the vast majority).  Getting "the other 99.998%" on board requires a brand-new set of motivations, different from the drivers which have driven the adoption to date.  
The "trend" that was previously in action has already stopped.  We hit saturation on minors and unskilled investors.  The hard-core hodlers are hodling, but they're not growing in number.  If BTC is to succeed further, it needs a new trend -- one which will bring onboard a completely new type of user.  The non-technical user.  The poor.  The overworked mom.  The undocumented immigrant.  The high-school dropout who lives in his car.  The grandma who does stocktake at Walmart.
It's not enough to say "I see no reason for failure."  What BTC needs now is "A new reason for success."  Without that, it ain't gonna make it.

And let's ignore the fact that the value of gold for example in real terms has oscillated wildly in the last 100 years to the point where "inflationary" or "deflationary" are almost meaningless terms.
But then I would argue that the wealth of the U.S.A. in the late 1800's and first half of the 1900's had nothing to do with central economic management.  It was all to do with the extra-ordinary abundance of natural resources.  There's nothing "special" about the U.S.A. or their economy.  If you give any half-competent country an overwhelming world-dominating shitload of oil, metal, and farmland, they're most likely going to become very wealthy.   The UK did that when they colonised India.  Norway did it when they discovered oil on their doorstep.
That was then.  This is now.  The U.S.A. has finished expanding to match its resource base, and now we have to deal with steady-state economics and not explosive-growth economics.

When you put your money into an Evil Bank or a Scum-Sucking Credit Card Company, you have to pay their damn fees!  In return, they implement a high-level of security measures, including government-some mandated parameters.  A large part of those fees also go towards the insurance fund that ensure that individuals can be recompensed in the case of accident or fraud.
If you choose to use crypto-currency (either a non-regulated exchange, or self-management) instead of a regulated Evil Bank, then:
a. The advantage is that you save money on fees and you are exempt from some government oversight -- handy if you are a criminal or paranoid
b. The disadvantage is that you give up the protections offered by the bank and/or the government
TL; DR - you chose to save money by not insuring your house, now it has burned down and you're fucked.
