Hi, I was the animator for this peice. Also a co-founder of Proof of Work. I designed everything out in illustrator then imported into after effects. There's a wee bit of cinema 4D in there. I used to do a lot of Flash animation back in the day. If you know Flash and Photoshop. You can get your head round after effects. It's a pretty easy transition.

Your the second animator in the world that works for bitcoin. :) actually I doubt I'm the first, I'm more of a motion graphics guy to be honest.

The most interesting doc about bitcoin so far. Not big budget but the quality of the content is unprecedented.

I had this idea a few years ago. Could we put a big qr code private key on a digital billboard somewhere that folks could sweep. Donators could throw bitcoin on there via a website and people could come along and sweep the board and take the BTC. Once they've swept the private key a certain random amount of time would pass then a new priv key would pop up to be swept. We could alternate different billboards around different parts of a city or in different cities around the world. One a key is swept in one city it would move to the next or something like that.
