Sorry if this is obvious, but will it matter if my BTC is stored on legacy (non segwit address, i.e. starting with '1') or Segwit address (starting with '3'). Regardless, will I be able to claim Bitcoin Segwit2x coins post fork?

Most ppl think bitcoin is a scam . The irony is the real scam is fiat .

What about Coinjar? Are they good ?

Not entirely sure how you've calculated these figures.
Focusing on blockchain.info only (it appears a different QR code is generated for the same public key, hence why I want to ignor blockr.io)
If only 14.04% of the blocks differ isn't that significant? Anyway I think if someone can be bothered to flick between two tabs in chrome for the blockchain link they'll be able to see where I'm coming from.

Thanks, point taken. I'm less worried now but just more curious about QR codes and why bits are similar across different keys. I'll look it up on google and check out your link.

I used it and I like it. Thank you. UI is a bit to be desired but fees are low.

Thank you for those thoughts CatatonicMan. I do agree with that. However, when I say 30% is identical, I'm referring to 'sections' of the QR code. If you open two tabs in Chrome, one for each address (on blockchain info), you'll see that whole 'sections' of the QR code are identical. This bundling of identical bits on the same areas of the QR code, is, statistically very improbable. That was my point.

So the missing link seems to have something to do with the QR code. I checked those two links and you are right, they are completely different. But for those SAME addresses, look at the QR codes on blockchain info, as below:
Clearly 30% is identical.
Can anyway let me know how the same QR data can be represented in a completely different QR code? Is it just a case of random redundancy built in to the code? I think I read somewhere else that the code itself can hold 2000 or more characters, and I guess the address is a fraction of that, so I guess this might be the answer?

The pattern exists, it is there. look at blockchain.info. 30% is identical (of the QR code)
@_date: 2016-10-28 19:56:30
But go to blockchain.info and punch in those two addresses. 30-40% of the QR code is identical. (this isnt the case for the 3rd public key I have) This cannot be by chance alone... Seems Im missing something. I'm interested if someone can come up with a logical response..
@_date: 2016-10-28 21:42:30
But the odds of 30% of the entire QR code space being identical is a massive statistical improbability for two randomly generated public keys. Hence why I'm interested in the correct reason that will explain why 30% is identical. (on blockchain.info)

Wait, I think I know what you mean. The raw bytes, is the raw bytes that represent all the data present in the QR Code, NOT the actual public address (which is in fact completely different between the two QR codes). Have I got my understanding correct?
@_date: 2016-10-29 11:25:11
Thank murbul! Very interesting. 
Therefore what I don't understand is why the decoded addresses are almost 40% similar? Shouldn't they be almost completely different? I generated these addresses using bitcoinpaperwallet.com using alot of random entropy. Would this suggest that potentially, the random number generator on that site is not all that good? Many thanks for your thoughts.

Here is the third decoded address (which I think looks different from other two), yet seems decoded text is also similar.
