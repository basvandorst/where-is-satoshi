As far as reddit is concerned, as long as r/btc remains moderated and controlled by Roger and his BCH shills, there will always be salt. 
As far as BCH's place as a Pseudo-Decentralized, Pseudo-Bitcoin, Pseudo-Etherium, Salesman Coin...
Aside from them ranting about how BCH is not BTC due to a "vicious marketing campaign" against them and the "sheep mentality" of the majority, which is outright disgusting by the way. And, whereas this claim, amongst others, are conspiratorial at best, there is ACTUAL evidence of their shameless marketing/conman tactics, which thankfully fail more and more over time.
Aside from their assertion that they only use r/btc because they are censored in r/Bitcoin, which though true, denies the reality of how badly they shill their Altcoin while trashing BTC and LN to no end. Also, their endless misleading misinformed memes...
Furthermore, it is also incredibly disengenious to assert that they do not censor, when they do through the use of aggressive downvotes which imposes a rate limit on posts and comments through Reddit itself. And, they also ban and remove posts/comments, though not as aggressively as r/Bitcoin, but nevertheless they prove themselves hypocrites regardless. The mods in r/btc also freely ignore their own rules to spam Roger's latest advertisements and bullpocky.
Nevertheless, there are other Altcoins that can do their job better, faster, and with far less toxicity. In fact with further developments and traction in LN, which at the crux of it is why they mock early development flaws and "18 months", BCH will not have a leg to stand on and is already dying besides.
Edit: Also, it is both hilarious and ludicrous that they take so much offense at "BCash" and "BCHABC", when they shamelessly refer to BITCOIN as "BCore" and "Bitcoin Core".
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:05:25
No problem. I admit my bias is clear and obvious. And, honestly, I would not be so against BCH, if not for Roger and his cronies. But, then again, it is also fair to say that BCH would have died ages ago without them. Still, whereas I regretfully own some BCH, I look forward to the day where it becomes as worthless as the many other failed forks that Bitcoin had before it.
@_date: 2019-03-08 18:52:00
Oh my, I do hope it is an alt for Egon_1. 
Goodness, it is scary to think that those things are breeding.
Roger needs to learn to neuter his bitches or grow another pair of tits from which he can suckle those rambunctious little pups.
@_date: 2019-03-09 09:24:10
Heh, some troll in r/btc that some believe is Roger using an alt (Number 1 Ego). Yet, nobody knows. 
However, whenever things start to get intelligent over there and when lesser, more literate, shills start posting their essays. 
Then, from the cesspools of numbskullery, emerges this one eyed abomination and his favorite catchphrase/mating call "cryptochecker".
@_date: 2019-03-09 14:57:19
Haha, if only, man. Bitmain invested too much into it and Roger is Roger. Yes, more or less for activity.
Previously, they were lauding some staged "winning" in Queenland, hating on lightning network, usual snide remarks on Bitcoin developers/promoters and movements like delete Coinbase, etc. 
Hmm, I cannot lie they have some legit good articles too, if you ignore the stuff from the full-time shills. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 18:32:49
Egon_1? Is that you? 
@_date: 2019-10-02 02:05:34
That is pretty sweet. But, that snippet of the painting triggered a little mischief in me:
"Bro... I... I had a -Bleeping- revelation... We {Resists urge to barf}... We need... Plan B!..."
"W.h.y. {Sleepy} B.r.o.?"
"Bro... It is written by a 'higher' power {Points to wall and lifelessy tries to steal his Bro's joint}"
"-Bleep- you Bro. Get your own {Awakens from groggy state and inhales deeply}. But, still {Exhales and stares at wall} that looks like some good -Bleep- right there... Oye, what the -Bleep- is that annoying yipping {Grabs head in pain}...
"Huh?... Oh... That's just a B-CH..."
"Urgg, for a tiny thing, it sure barks big"
"Ignore it, Bro... It probably wants to take a piss..."
"{Rubs glabella in frustration} I guess... Anyway, Bro, we can try to score some of that {Points to wall} later, it is too late now."
"Nah, Bro... {A ray of light shines on the wall} it is early..."
@_date: 2019-02-03 12:35:05
Aye, and we will remain compromised as long as Bitcoin.com and r/btc remain tainted by BCash or BJWs, new label given how often they play victim to justify their perpetual BS like SJWs. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 03:53:38
Hmm, I would start by determining what skills you possess and what you can offer that would be of use to someone holding, trading, and/or mining Bitcoin. Then, try to market your qualifications and services to them. I suppose, aside from here, you could go to LocalBitcoins and try to open a dialog with a reputed dealer that is in relative close proximity to where you live.
@_date: 2019-02-09 14:55:46
I am a bit disappointed that you used John. But, I guess the one I am thinking of is many things, except fat ��

I see, thank you for the information and your experience.
@_date: 2019-02-05 09:36:05
Hmm, that one is actually a rather old scam. 
And, as much as we would like to say that it will confuse newbies, the fact is that you need some intelligence and experience to deal with Bitcoin for the long term. 
As most of the big scams died shortly after the crash, except BCash, yet that is only a matter of time. And, as a lot of people were burnt throughout; if they still confuse a scam coin for Bitcoin, then it really is just Darwinism at work.
@_date: 2019-02-09 14:37:55

Hmm, I think Sri Lanka is alegal, with the Banks official statement being one of caution, while shamelessly blocking any credit card transactions suspected of dealing with cryptocurrencies and blacklisting any account involved as being "suspicious".

Here is a handy starter link:

Hmm, I'd switch the ones for 2018 and 2019. Also, good call not putting a 2020, we do not have flying cars yet.
@_date: 2019-02-28 18:06:32
Heh, I legit love the BCash character. It is so bloody spot on. And, your choice for Ether genuinely invoked a chuckle. Hope to see more ��
@_date: 2019-02-08 14:56:19
Hmm, interesting. I would think that a merchant would flip their lid, if they were even a dollar short of what they expected to gain. As I do recall, a childhood incident where a dollar difference almost led to a dumbass friend being tossed out of a Cici's. Does it really not bother you? 
Now, I do understand that drawing in more customers would outweigh the loss for now. But, what about long term?
Or, is it rather that you have faith that when it does become more developed and mainstream, that such incidents would not occur? 
And, may I ask how long you have been using it and what it is you are selling? 
Are you not interested in incorporating LN as well? Or, have you tried that and decided against it? Did that experience, if so, go badly?
@_date: 2019-12-30 02:32:38
A pity there is not an option to report misinformation. But, not like Reddit cares. As I doubt there is not a single day where a report could not be made for targeted harassment or vote manipulation.
Let's see, it usually goes like this:
Hayden is happy to post slanted or incomplete or outright lies regarding BTC or LN.
David is happy to "moderate" (aka. Censor) and link past bullshit to support current bullshit. 
Roger is happy to flaunt his latest advertisements and one sided history lessons.
Egon (Roger/David probably) is happy to post the same stupid meme ad nauseum and continue to be an obnoxious cryptochecker ass.
Then, of course, there is the "genuine" newbie that occasionally comes along to declare how much they love the "friendly" and "supportive" BCH community and how "awesome" BCH is...
Oh and how could I forget the PSAs regarding trolls against BCH in r/BTC, which of course is justified as being the BCH subreddit on the basis of SJW logic and censorship... And, on that note, the cries of being "censored" here, whereas it would be called "moderation" there...
Hmm, what else. Oh right, they do sometimes post about "exciting" developments in BCH, which typically boils down to the same picture of their roadmap. Some unsubstantiated by actual data claims that adoption/usage is growing. And, some other rubbish about how price does not matter, except when it comes to fees and when there is a small pump in their price.
Did I miss anything?
Edit: Oh, that's right, there are also the fantastical conspiracy theories by little miss jessquit, amongst others...
@_date: 2019-12-30 04:14:05
Heh, I know right... What was it like 52K out of the millions of dollars worth of crypto transactions conducted in Australia alone for a particular month and SOMEHOW, through severe stretches of imagination, BCH is "King" in Australia. 
But, then again he has a great mentor/boss in Roger, who recently flaunted how ONE burger king is SOMEHOW indicative of ALL burger kings supporting BCH ALONE.
Sigh, the echo chamber is indeed strong in that hive of scum and villainy.
@_date: 2019-02-08 09:00:46
Nah, just self-righteous cowards in denial of simple facts.
@_date: 2019-12-30 04:23:07
Why not both �� 
But, yes, I agree completely.
@_date: 2019-02-08 07:17:38
Hmm, is it not strange how they have tunnel vision. I mean they are correct in stating that bigger blocks and 0-confirmation is faster for transactions. 
But, fail to see how stupidly dangerous that is. Also, it may not pose a risk to the chain itself, but it only takes a handful of bad actors to utterly ruin those merchants that happily accept their tips/bribes.
And, it honestly boggles the mind how they harp on about how LN has flaws or how BTC is slow and inefficient, without understanding that it should be that way, especially for a truly decentralized network. 
I mean, for goodness sakes, we have barely tapped into the global population and are still in the early stages. It is foolish and reckless to make big changes too quickly and these should be taken with great caution and care.
Also, Roger, who I am also starting to suspect is that fucktard Egon, needs to stop being a petty little bitch.
@_date: 2019-12-30 01:13:24
Lord, I love how quickly the BCH Shills stole this for their BCH Shilling on the BTC subreddit.
@_date: 2019-01-26 14:54:05
As far as I am aware, Visa is currently against cryptocurrencies, but there are ways around their blanket ban depending on where you go and live.
Bisq, LocalBitcoins (although there is currently a phishing attack going on through their forum apparently), and Paxful are good. Coinbase, and services like them, allow linking your bank account directly to them to buy and sell. Although, Coinbase will time lock your purchased cryptocurrencies before allowing you to withdraw.
You can also use bank transfers with reputed exchanges and most of them do offer a wide variety of other payment options.
But, always remember, not your keys, not your Bitcoin. Be sure to transfer them to your own wallets when the purchase is cleared. Also, never mention anything crypto related with bank transfers or the like, especially if you are in India.
@_date: 2019-01-21 10:34:27
Bravo. 
Indeed, that was well written and conveyed with much gusto. Rock on��
@_date: 2019-01-24 08:41:39
More to break away from the notion that you must own 1 BTC to own some Bitcoin. And, to make it easier for mass adoption.  
Consider, which sounds better that you bought 0.001561 BTC vs you bought 15.61 Core of BTC. 
Yet, I guess we could just go with 156,100.00 Satoshi. But, with that there is a slight disconnect from the notion that you bought Bitcoin.
Hmm, for me the reason has more to do with how 0.01 BTC draws mental parallels with the notion of having a penny in USD. Does not seem all that impressive.
Still, perhaps you are right ��...
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:36:52
Oh, sorry. I did not expect them to be that difficult to deal with, given how often they are recommended. In some places, they are pretty much the only option, aside from Paxful. I've been considering trying it out myself as our options here are also pretty limited...
@_date: 2019-01-23 10:43:04
Oh wow, skimmed through and interesting that they admitted Bitcoin is successful. 
But, funny how they address the issue of power cost, despite the fact that printing fiat is far worse in terms of resources wasted and the impact on the environment.
Still, it is actually quite a good read. Thank you for sharing it.
Definitely have to take the time to digest it slowly.
@_date: 2019-01-18 05:13:15
You raise a good point. Hmm, any suggestions?
Hmm, I suppose the easiest way would be to not use "Bit" and use something else...
Hehe... Why not substitute "Bit" with "Core"...
Hahaha, that would be hilarious...
It would literally go, Bitcoin... Core... Satoshi...
That does it, gotta amend my original comment!
@_date: 2019-01-25 05:01:26
Hmm, so the bubbles they see are actually from them being boiled alive.
@_date: 2019-01-24 12:41:56
Seriously? Even with Core being used as part of the metric? It literally goes Bitcoin Core Satoshi.
Sigh, nevermind, it was just an idea.
@_date: 2019-01-22 23:52:33
Bitcoin in and of itself is a democratic process. As to taxation, if anything, given that we are dealing with an immutable public ledger where a large majority bought their BTC from KYC exchanges, it would be easier to ensure that everyone pays their fair share, though I'd imagine the process would be different from what we have now.

Hmm, I think I might need to see a doctor after reading that. At the start, I thought the author was going the route of a subtle sarcastic smartass with respect to that Judas Bastard. In the middle, my stomach was starting to get quezy as it was becoming readily apparent that the author, much in the fashion of OPs in 9GaG, was dead serious and thoroughly gobbling down on roger's roger. I skimmed through the rest as I was afraid that absolute disgust would send me to the ER.
@_date: 2019-01-28 08:52:20
Haha, nice, thanks for that share ��
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:38:50
Hmm, I think it depends on whether the merchant is smart and uses something clever or indirect. On that note, it was once possible to use Virvox to buy an mmo currency through PayPal and then sell the mmo currency for Bitcoin. But, that is no longer an option. But yes, I have pretty much abandoned any attempt to purchase with a credit card, though it might be different depending on where you are. 
Oh, and if you are lucky, there might be a Bitcoin ATM within reasonable distance.
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:50:02

Because I want to take the chance that my parents did not when they could have invested in various companies and projects that seem obvious today, but would have been loaded with FUD at the time. 
Nor, do I want to make the same mistake they did when they believed it was too late to board those rockets to the moon. 
As much as I love and respect them for all they have done for me. I do not want to look back and think "if only". No, even if it fails, I want to reminisce on those painful days and think, I am glad that I was brave enough to take the risk.
@_date: 2019-01-11 14:48:33
@_date: 2019-01-23 01:54:00
No problem. But, if we consider the scenario that Bitcoin does take off, then there would be no need for taxation with respect to it. Rather, all a government would need to do is hold a sufficient reserve, due to it being deflationary and infinitely divisible in theory.
@_date: 2019-01-18 04:38:58
(Amended, "Bit" changed to "Core")
Hmm, this is a very good idea, except you are kinda using the wrong metrics. A MilliBit should equal to 0.001 of a Bit. So if we were to correct this, it would be:
1 Bitcoin = 1 BTC
0.1 Bitcoin = 1 KiloCore
0.01 Bitcoin = 1 HectoCore
0.001 Bitcoin = 1 DekaCore
0.0001 Bitcoin = 1 Core
0.00001 Bitcoin = 1 DeciCore or 1 KiloSat
0.000001 Bitcoin = 1 CentiCore or 1 HectoSat
0.0000001 Bitcoin = 1 MilliCore or 1 DekaSat
0.00000001 Bitcoin = 1 Satoshi or 1 Sat
Then, in the future we could go further:
0.000000001 Bitcoin = 1 DeciSat
0.0000000001 Bitcoin = 1 CentiSat
0.00000000001 Bitcoin = 1 MilliSat
But, all in all, very much in favor of this.
@_date: 2019-01-24 06:44:49
Hilarious. Can we also ask them to stop wasting far more resources on constantly printing fiat and to start thinking about the impact it has on the environment.
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:17:38
Hmm, I could believe Roger or Faketoshi doing that.
@_date: 2019-01-23 03:23:48
Ah, you misunderstand the division. 1 BTC has 8 decimal places, it is quite possible to make it 9 or 10. In fact, this could be done alongside the halfening to ensure that mining remains relevant indefinitely.
As to nations creating their own digital currency. The truth is that the fiat we have today is mostly digital to begin with and maintained through a centralized ledger that could not be allowed to fail in the past as there was no viable alternative. 
Yes, Bitcoin may not be the king in the future, but the idea of a decentralized global immutable public ledger is powerful. And, do not forget, Bitcoin has the largest and most secure network compared to the other cryptocurrencies as well as the longest history of success. Also, where it is easy to give into despair and feel that a centralized authority is too strong. Never forget that history has also shown that even the greatest of empires, no matter how powerful, have fallen. It is the people whose backs on which they derive their power that determine the future and if they decide they want something different, then their will shall be done.
As long as there is humanity or an entity capable of independent autonomous thought, there will always be corruption. But, a trustless system, as what Bitcoin first offered, is perhaps the closest thing we currently have towards freedom from such bias. 
Never give up hope, as long as you can think you can find a way, so long as you can breathe you can move forward. Let not the fear of a small group of fellow mortals keep you from believing in a better tomorrow.

But, that is the thing, before we can expand the Crypto Kingdom, we must build a strong foundation and show the people how powerful Bitcoin can be. Both as a idea and as a principle in action. Only then will people see the light and want to delve deeper into cryptocurrencies in general. 
Before we can run, we must walk, and before that we must crawl. At present, the old bastards are gloating that the price is much lower than the ATH as well as the cost to mine, which is nothing new for them. Yet, if we reach a new ATH, especially after so many got burnt last year. Then, we not only validate our Hodler faith, but show the world that there is nothing wrong in believing in Bitcoin or projects like it. In addition, those that were burnt will finally have a salve.
That said, fortune favors the bold, and it is those that word hard and take risks during hard times that have the highest likelihood of benefiting long term.

First, be sure to consult a tax consultant, if there is doubt.
Second, there is no reason to tell them where you got the Bitcoin. In truth, they could theoretically trace it, but it really is not worth the effort. Furthermore, there is nothing to legalize, Bitcoin is Global, it will crosses borders whether a government wants it to or not. And, it is also not Fiat, which is something else to remember.
Third, how would things go if you sold shares of stock and withdrew the cash or were paid for doing something online. Same principle.

Hmm, if you have some cash that you can afford to lose, like say what you might usually spend a month on a hobby or interest as opposed to needs or necessities, then there is nothing lost in putting that money instead into Bitcoin, for a month or longer.
@_date: 2019-01-12 00:38:26
Coins that are lost with no chance of recovery are lost forever, unless a future update to the protocol makes it possible to find them or someone wins the galactic lottery by going against the astronomical odds of guessing the key. But, the former is unlikely to happen as every lost Bitcoin increases the value of every other Bitcoin. And, as it is digital, Bitcoin can be made infinitely divisible.

Look would you be excited to get a penny from someone? 0.01 USD?
No right?
Now take that sentiment and apply it to 0.01 BTC. Even though, 0.01 BTC is worth around $40 (though imo substantially undervalued) the mentality of owning a penny of Bitcoin does not seem appealing despite the fact that it should.
@_date: 2019-01-15 16:55:43
Hmm, I think LocalBitcoins or Paxful might be the best method. I would suggest BitPay, but not sure if it will be available/usable in India. Good luck to you, it is outrageous what the banks are doing there.
@_date: 2019-01-12 16:11:44
In the short term, you would need to take complete ownership of your shares, severing any intermediary connections, such as brokers, and then sell directly to any interested party for Bitcoin. In the long term, they, being intelligent greedy people as well, would make the option available in time.

Decentralization. 
In history, we have tales of great conquerors and extroadinary leaders, those that founded empires that spanned the globe and reigned supreme, their glory so profound that they are revered even to this day. But, where is the Macedonian Empire of Alexander the Great, where is the Roman Empire lead by Julius Caesar, where is the Mongolian Empire of Genghis Khan, where are those incredible unstoppable juggernauts of their time. Fallen, no matter how great or capable the central authority, those that believed in them will be betrayed, because for all our brilliance as a species, our boundless capacity to conceive of the very fabric of the universe, we are mortal and fated to decay and die. The inherent flaw of any great system is that trust must be given to a relatively small group to effectively manage an important aspect for the whole, but those that are trusted, aside from their short lives, will be faced with the proverbial seven deadly sins and not all are strong enough to resist them and the odds of the next generation being able to do that as well is far smaller. Furthermore, as the system expands, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage the system, without further trust being expanded onto subgroups, which makes it near impossible to effectively maintain in the long term as well as incredibly expensive as well.
In truth, corruption and lethargy is all but inevitable.
Now, imagine a system that works not because trust is given, but because no one trusts anyone else, with each incentivized to safeguard and expand the system, with each new node and miner making it more secure. Bitcoin, may not be the most efficient cryptocurrency, but it is arguably the most difficult thing in the world to hack, due to its extensive global network that continues to grow each day. The beauty of its genius, aside from being the first successful application of a decentralized system in all of humanity, is that it evolves based on majority support. That is marvelous on so many levels and as opposed to the plethora of new forms of mindless entertainment and distractions that are showcased as "technological breakthroughs", we finally have a sign of humanity making a small, but positive step forward.

Hmm, then you could technically get away with it, except that doing so is disrespectful. And, having raised you, they will likely know your emotional state rather well. Such that, they could tell you were hiding something regardless.
But, if you can get some alone time with one of your parents, then you could ask him/her if they would be interested in listening to what you have learnt about Bitcoin (not about mining, expect nothing, try your level best not to get frustrated by their lack of understanding, and do not act as if you are teaching/lecturing them). 
Be open and patient, cheat a little by tapping into some childish innocence in a non-obnoxious way, and share some links and resources that you have used to broaden your understanding, but that you would like them to review in case you misunderstood something. Such as:
Remember, you have a bountiful resource with the posts and comments here at r/Bitcoin as well. So long as you avoid the... other one...
Anyway, take your time to discuss Bitcoin with them, expect it to take months and you'll be surprised when it takes weeks instead. But, eventually try to make a judgement call on whether they have a fair understanding. Then, broach the subject of what you want to do, sharing those resources as well, and ask whether they would be willing to allow you to mine with their supervision.
If this fails, then at least you tried.

Sigh, it is easy to feel oppressed by debt. We are born facing the debt of our parents and we add onto that as they raise us. Then, we begin to gain more debt through our studies. And, later with any living and traveling expenses needed to work a job to not only survive, but to begin the long arduous process of settling the accumulated debt. This already feels impossible to settle, except society or culture will imply that being single is unacceptable. This leads to more debt through courtship, marriage, and perhaps worst of all children. This simply makes the cycle of debt appear endless. Unless one is lucky or exceptional, they will likely spend most of their life in debt. Most will become free, while ignoring the fate of their children, when they are too old to do anything much about it. Others will die with it and pass it onto their descendants.  
In truth, with the current system, the illusion of value in fiat currency is a vital necessity to keep the whole system afloat for debt is literally all there is. 
So can a decentralized global financial system provide the crux needed for the world to break out of their lingering and debilitating connection to gold and give ourselves room to breathe by effectively converting the old system into a new game by using a new mechanic to upgrade it?
Maybe, a growing number would like to believe that and have invested early. But, it is hard to say with any certainty. And, how long it will take, no one knows.
But, this is very important to know and something I personally believe in:
As long as you can think, you can find a way. As long as you can breathe, you have the capacity to move forward. Giving into despair does nothing. Fight for your future.

Hmm, it is kinda hard to do that when a leader and prominent figurehead of the BCH community loves posting and promoting posts that declare BTC is a scam, BTC developers are corrupt sellouts, BTC believers are blind sheep and so on, all in the /btc section of all things. And, they believe this is not dividing the community, which they blame squarely on the BTC developers, but rather is a fight for their right to be heard and not be censored, despite acting like complete asses in the process. Sadly, if you think these are exaggerations or randomly stated in the distant past, then please check out u/MemoryDealers. On a side note, I honestly feel that the biggest reason BCH and BTC cannot get along is because of Roger and that does not strike me as slander, more like simple fact. And, more to the point, his followers are under the strong impression that they are victims and that they must defend their one true Bitcoin, BCH, while denouncing the rightful king, BTC.

Hmm, we need a study calculating how much they waste on constantly printing fiat, as well as for the transport, security, and distribution of it.
Then, when we can prove that it is over a thousand times worse than anything the mining of cryptocurrencies can achieve, we should make a case demanding that they stop printing untraceable currency.
This does not undermine them, as roughly 8% of fiat exists as hard money, while the rest exists in centralized digital ledgers. So, we can save the environment, curb criminal activity, and fuck their bloody hypocrisy.

Precisely, when we left the gold standard for currencies we started to base it all on the US Dollar. But, that had a lot to do with the gold reserves and the debt that accumulated was essentially an endless series of IOUs based on that. If that lingering connection is severed, we could essentially reset the system. Of course, my understanding could be flawed or wrong. Still, I believe that having a decentralized deflationary currency as a counter balance to the centralized inflationary currency should have some benefit in theory.

And, where was their civic duty, when people lost a lot of money through online gambling, as well as from risky option trading and the like. 
And, why do they turn a blind eye when they know that their clients have subscribed for suspicious services or paid for things too sensitive for their naive minds to handle.
And, how dare they enable terrorist and illegal activities. Do they not know that their printed currency is untraceable and easy to hide. 
Also, where is there sense of environmental decency.
Do they not know that their constant printing of fiat drains our resources and has a negative impact on the environment at a level that goes far beyond anything that the mining of cryptocurrencies could achieve in their entirety.

True, except that with Bitcoin, and the like, being a global immutable ledger, as opposed to the centralized ledger of the banks, which we will never see and which can be edited as they see fit, it is actually easier to track where dirty money goes as opposed to harder.

Hmm, I can get your reasoning, they, which I suppose refers to the banking cartel, print the money and maintain the ledgers, so there is not much stopping them from colluding together to "spend" the money necessary to take down Bitcoin, which I believe is your argument? Except, that a revolutionary idea is damn near impossible to kill, even if they were to succeed for a short time; and, it would be short for all it would take is a slight change to the protocol to render their special asic miners useless. The fact remains that there is nothing they could do to stop a new Bitcoin from emerging from the ashes. Also, this trick would only work once and require a united effort to pull off. It would also not be difficult for the countless nerds across the globe to understand what had happened and would be an extroadinarily difficult task to explain to the global sheep how they basically printed 10B out of thin air to kill what they claim is "a ponzi scheme with no intrinsic value".
@_date: 2019-01-27 04:15:34
Bitcoin has a fixed supply and the block reward halves every 4 years. As such, being deflationary, makes BTC more valuable over time. 
It is the reverse of how your grandparents might say that they bought something for a penny back in the day, but now it costs a dollar. This is because fiat is inflationary.

Oh, I most certainly agree. But, I proposed an alternative to it in that thread that follows more accurately with the metric standard:
1 Bitcoin = 1 BTC
0.1 Bitcoin = 1 KiloCore
0.01 Bitcoin = 1 HectoCore
0.001 Bitcoin = 1 DekaCore
0.0001 Bitcoin = 1 Core
0.00001 Bitcoin = 1 DeciCore or 1 KiloSat
0.000001 Bitcoin = 1 CentiCore or 1 HectoSat
0.0000001 Bitcoin = 1 MilliCore or 1 DekaSat
0.00000001 Bitcoin = 1 Satoshi or 1 Sat
Then, in the future we could go further:
0.000000001 Bitcoin = 1 DeciSat
0.0000000001 Bitcoin = 1 CentiSat
0.00000000001 Bitcoin = 1 MilliSat

Overall, it is clear you put a lot of work into this and it is also well cited, which is good. But, I would advise slowly reading through what you wrote and making sure that the words flow well together.
As pointed out by u/TheGreatMuffin, you should change it to Bitcoin, not BitCoin. Also do not forget the plural of Bitcoin is Bitcoin as well. 
In addition, he is correct in asserting that there are some gaps in knowledge that present themselves. Such as the omission of the cost of electricity and the limited supply as well. In fact, before discussing what factors influence the price of Bitcoin. Ask yourself why a decentralized global immutable ledger is so significant and why it has value. If you can convince yourself of this, then you will find it easier to transform a mechanical assignment into a work that strikes at the heart of your readers. 
Never forget that despite our immense capacity for logic, we are an emotional species. So do not just summarize studies, throw in your own thoughts and opinions. It does not matter that you are not an expert. What you think matters and should be conveyed. Not just at the end, but throughout.
That said, understand that you did a good job. Take a breather, relax, and when or if you feel up to it, step up to the challenge and turn an overall rating of 3 into 5.

Also, take in consideration their affiliation with BitDeer, sure the hash rates sound amazing, but then you factor in the ridiculous maintenance fees and you realize that you are basically paying them some Bitcoin to get 1/6th of it back to you in 30 days.

Simply that Bitcoin, being the first, has the longest history of success which through the first mover advantage and brand recognition gives it a tremendous advantage in terms of the size of its network, the prospect for its growth, and the confidence in its development; which no other cryptocurrency is capable of matching as of yet.

But then, something foul emerged from the depths of corporate greed and he, recognizing the motherfucking devil for what it was, made a choice. He choose to sacrifice what he stood for to protect the people from what might corrupt all they believed in. He made himself the most recognized face of BCH and destroyed any semblance of creditability towards it by ruthlessly associating it with the trademark signs of a scam, employing tactics so vile and yet so obvious that only a minority, and not the majority needed, would be tainted by its accursed influence. 
Think about it, do you think such a smart man, would go on such a childish tantrum, unless he wanted to popularize the term "BCash". Do you think someone possessing such boundless wisdom would associate himself with such an eloquent fraud as Craig Wright, unless he wanted to cement the notion that he was working a con?

Mate, I keep trying to point out that it does not have to be a case of either this or that. Certainly, if we absolutely had to pick one, then traditional banking would be the obvious choice, at present. But, that does not mean that will always be the case. Nor, does it mean that we cannot incorporate both into our lives. I realize that being different does not equate to being better. And, cryptocurrencies are not, at present. But, having an option to pick from, even if the other choice is better, is not necessarily a bad thing and does not necessarily mean that we cannot pick both.
Yes, what you say is true regarding the distribution of wealth. That also applies to the traditional system.
There are far more than a handful of whales. But, yes if a pod of them decided to cash out, the market would crash. But, as long as people want it, use it, and continue mining it. Then, it would not die. Can it? Sure, if enough people in the space no longer see it as valuable, then it certainly will. I do not deny the risk or the volatility.
No, I am not. Perfection does not exist. But, it is nonetheless a worthwhile notion to strive for and that will invariably require trying out different approaches and ideas, even if they are not instantaneously better than the current methodology. 
Slight modifications? Easier? Sure, present your evidence. You have admitted that there are serious flaws previously. If they are such a simple matter to resolve, then do explain why they still exist and persist.
Again, it does not have to be so black and white. It is neither possible or feasible to replace the current system and to immediately do so is impossible. But, again, having the option to choose an alternative is not a bad thing and it does not necessarily undermine the traditional option. On the contrary, the amount of money laundered by banks per year easily surpases the entire market cap for cryptocurrencies.
20 years? I can check my entire Bitcoin transaction history on my phone and transfer any amount to anyone at any time at minimal cost and time. I am notified and can check any of my past and present transactions with just my phone alone. As to decentralized, the bank can at any point stop any of my transactions and how they have and continue to exert their power to oppress people involved in this space is part of the reason why so many are so adamant about having a different option. Now, you may not see it that much in the States. But to say that transactions/accounts to lawfully abiding exchanges are not denied/closed on a flimsy basis is a downright lie.
But, yes, you are right, banks are improving their capabilities. 
No, that is not my point. I am saying it is absurd to point out that 4% own 96% of a comparatively small chunk of global wealth, when 1% own over half of the entirety.
Also, it does not matter how much Cryptocurrency you own, what determines the future and direction of Bitcoin is the hashing power and the nodes. Can wealth allow you to get more hashing power and nodes? Sure. But, anyone else can do the same whether they are inside the space now or come in later.
I do not get why you are confirming my rebuttal as to why China (as you had previously mentioned) or a single entity cannot just take control of the network. But, thanks, I guess?
Man, you've completely missed the point regarding forks. I guess my capacity to explain is too limited. 
Okay, as stimulating as this conversation was, I think we have pretty much reached the bottom. Now, I know that you will have plenty to say about what I have written here (honestly looking forward to it) and if that means that I lost the debate, as it were, so be it (of course, will read and maybe fume afterwards). But, I confess to have reached the limits of my capacity. Yet, for what it is worth, despite some uncertainty, I am grateful for our discussion. I admit that you have enlightened me on some points and I hope that I was able to convey at least some basis, no matter how flawed, as to why people are genuinely interested in cryptocurrencies.

That is informative and I confess my knowledge is a bit lacking. And, Bitcoin also had a central figure to set the ground work/rules before it became what it is. It would never have existed otherwise.
Hmm, perhaps my views on centralized authority has become overly jaded. I cannot honestly say that society would be better off, if we completely or even partially went decentralized. And, even if we could somehow achieve this, someone/something has to set the foundation. Yet, it is also currently and historically apparent that centralized power/trust will always lead to corruption and decay.
You've given me something to think about and reflect. Thank you, kind stranger.
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:55:50
Ah, but that is the thing. Simply because it has never been done successfully in the past, does not mean that it cannot be done eventually, as our species continues to advance and grow. It certainly, much like flying, would have been impossible in the past. But, with continued advancements in technology, it became reality and we gain the capacity to strive towards even greater impossibilities as a result.
You have raised good points regarding regulation and authority, but that is not something, despite the fanatics, that cryptocurrencies are necessarily opposed to. Certainly, it is trying to offer a viable alternative to Central Banking, which has only been around for a few hundred years, and that authority can go monopolize itself. But, as you have mentioned, we cannot avoid government regulation so easily. And, though I do feel that cryptocurrencies cannot be killed without first killing the internet, which is by no means feasible or practical for them to unanimously agree to and would essentially demand the apocalypse, that is not to say that cryptocurrencies are opposed to oversight. In fact, at the heart of it, every transaction from the inception of Bitcoin, can be tracked by anyone with a internet connection. It is ultimately a ledger, a global public immutable one at that, one that becomes harder to compromise with every node and user that connects to it. It is pseudo annonymous and despite it being harder to track through collaborative efforts, it is invariably a matter of time and research, before all the fixed dots become connected. If anything it is theoretically much easier to determine the wealth of an individual and tax them through cryptocurrencies, than it would be with traditional cash. 
As to replacing fiat, I am amongst those that believe that the deflationary nature of Bitcoin would be a good counterbalance to the inflationary nature of fiat. It is very much a trade off between accepting the burden of individual responsibility and the cost of trusting another to do so for you. Perhaps that is naive. But, I do feel that with time, just as technology progresses and people naturally gravitate towards the better option, traditional fiat could become a thing of the past, and that we have long been overdue for a viable digital option. Also, regardless of how imposing a central authority might be, as long as the people want the system to change, it will happen, as history has proven time and time again. 
The fact of the matter is that cryptocurrencies are growing and are gaining greater adoption. It is easily observable, though admittedly at quite a slow pace. Nevertheless, we are still in the early days, though perhaps saying so is also naive. But, the prospects and the potential for change in the long term are tantalizing.
I disagree with your last statement and would point out that cash has been guilty of far worse throughout a much longer period of time. But, if you do not see how cryptocurrencies are an improvement, in at least some ways, and only see it as being useful for criminals, which is frankly naive. Consider an example, let us say that my daughter is studying half way around the world, and an emergency comes up and she needs a large amount of money and fast. Now regardless of the what and why. A wire transfer of this nature is not only expensive, but can take up to a week. As opposed to the minutes, and with options like the lightning network under development even less than that, to transfer that portion of my wealth to her in the form of Bitcoin. Traditional Banking has advantages that cryptocurrencies cannot match. Yet. But, it is also very slow, has grown complacent, and is not fully operational 24/7. Also, whereas you can only check, maybe up to a year of your personal transactions, without requesting the bank itself, you can easily check any period of time with Bitcoin.
Still, this is my take on it and I respect your view on the subject as well. I am not entirely intractable, I could very well be wrong. But, I am of the mind that cryptocurrencies have a role and a place. At the very least as a small step along the way to progress or a failure that a success can one day benefit from.
@_date: 2019-09-29 03:44:56
Hmm, you make good points regarding value and the current system. But, complacency and historical precedence should not mean that we should not try different ideas and approaches. Yet, what you said is true. And, I am guilty of falling into the belief that the current financial situation is untenable. Indeed, as they control the system, they can adjust it, as and when needed. In that case, it may be less that the system is doomed, but more a desire for an individual to have greater control of their wealth. But, that is a risky trade-off, freedom or stability, and whereas a person may desire freedom, society depends on stability. Thank you, that was perhaps a much needed pail of cold water.
I am actually of the notion of Bitcoin being a store of value, aka. digital gold. A base layer from which it is possible to facilitate currency by building secondary and side layers, which are being pursued and have varying degrees of success, as well as issues. In a way, people see it more as the history of money renewing itself in the digital space. But, I suppose that digs into the argument of value. Still, it is intriguing.
It is not exactly a fabrication when there are serious issues. And, it is not something that is easy to fix in a short period of time. Yet, true, regardless of how high the global debt becomes, it is within the capacity of those in charge to adjust and control. I could make the argument of how poorer nations suffer under the yolk of the more powerful as a result. But, I am not an altruist. And, the strong being in control is nothing new. Nor, despite adult sized children demanding otherwise, will that ever change. Apologies, I went on a bit of a tangent there.
I think that we can agree that though the current system works, it is flawed. In truth, not game breakingly so and I admit that you convinced me on that point. But, imperfection fuels a desire to experiment and can bring with it innovation as people try out new approaches. Perhaps, that is not cryptocurrencies. But, we should never allow ourselves to stagnate or settle for the status quo. Besides, more often than not, despite being novel, new ideas tend to be far inferior to the current methodology, which is also far more common and wide spread. But, that is only until they gain support and development. I understand that you do not see such prospects in cryptocurrencies, but others do.
MLMs have become so integrated with our society that it is virtually impossible to separate it out from our lives. But, is not the belief that there is no better alternative to the current system and that it is seemingly pointless to try or risk societal ruin, a beast of a similar vein? 
Hmm, forgive the bluntness, but so what if 4% of the addresses control 96% of Bitcoin. Less than 1% of the world's population control over half of the world's wealth.
I am alright. My wealth is diversified and I would be by no means be comprised if Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies fail. But, I am indeed a very small fish in the space.
Monopoly in the sense that there is only the traditional banking system. But, you are correct in the follow-up paragraph. 
It is true that the majority of the mining pools are in China. But, the hashing power of these pools are not solely derived from Chinese mining farms alone. Even if someone were to seize control of all of China's mining pools, the rest of the world is not going to sit back and let a sole entity control it. They can transfer their hashing power to other pools outside of China. Yet, if that were not enough, the global majority can fork the chain and slightly change the mining algorithm to render all ASIC machines useless. This would hurt them as well. But, I am certain that the people in this space would rather shot themselves in the foot, than let one person spit on their collective faces. It is not quite as easy as some may think to seize control of the network. But, yes, the wealthy can accrue far more hashing power than the poor and have far more say in what direction Bitcoin goes.
Hmm, that is true. A person going about their day to day life would only care that it is convenient and that it reliably works. But, I think you underestimate the utility of blockchain technology, which even those against Bitcoin are intrigued by. And, that having a system that theorically works, not because trust is given, but because no one trusts anyone else (yeah I know we can debate that, but this is a belief in the space) is fascinating. Still, you make a good point, on the surface, even if it worked as well as the current system, no one without the know, would care or bother.
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:41:10
I was a bit puzzled of how to respond to the first part and have to give you props for it. It is one of the strongest arguments against traditional banking and a favorite talking point of crypto enthusiasts. Hmm, I truly wanted to state that the two systems are fundamentally different. And, that I was arguing about the corruption of centralized power and the potential of a decentralized system. But, I know such would be a hollow talking point, given your clear stance on the matter, as well as my own.
I do not believe that intrinsic value exists. It is all rather subjective and dependant on the circumstances. As to stocks, there are those that have value, despite the company having long since expired. But, yeah, I know we are definitely not going to agree on the matter of value for Bitcoin/Cryptocurrencies either. I am not trying to be dismissive. But, I think we can amicably agree that we certainly disagree on that.
I agree, except for the bit of "illegal activities" only. I know full well that it can fail and that there is much that can and is being done to hinder/stop it. Yet, as should be apparent from my own replies, I am very much enthralled and intrigued by this alternative monetary system. But, I will admit that there is obviously an element of greed/gambling involved. And, that certainly gives a happy feeling to those, understanding the volatile nature of the market, who can make a few hundreds or thousands with every dip and rise. Yet, I suppose that goes back to your remark about online gambling. Still, debt and gambling seems to go hand in hand with our species. It is after all why we are facing a global financial crisis in the first place.
Yeah, this is true. Yet, the way people are seeing it is not of the sense of a desperate lotto ticket. But, more of a sense that they finally have an opportunity to invest in what they perceive as being the early apple or google of our time. A sense of if only my elders invested in this, but now that it is my turn I will take the chance. A gamble true enough though.
In regards to your question, I have long since gotten a return on my investment. Yet, not outrageously so. I would like to, of course, as would anyone else. But, I am more curious than anything else to see where it goes. And, find myself intrigued, despite my limitations, in learning more about it and the developments therein.
Oh, I agree cryptocurrencies are flawed, very much so. But, the people in this space see it more as early developmental flaws. As we are dealing with code, it is far easier to improve and fix. And, let's be realistic a big long standing company that has done things a certain way for ages is far less receptive to meaningful change and improvement than a young startup. 
Backtracking to the point regarding forks. Yes, there have been over a 100. And, yet it is only the one that garners the support and hashing power of the majority that is Bitcoin. In a sense you can think of it as being that prior to a fork, 100% support Bitcoin. Then, if 20% wants to keep or change something about it. That 20% can create a fork, which will take with it an appropriate portion of the value as well. But, unless that 20% can gain more support, then what tends to happen is that their value stagnates and eventually dies out as the 20% becomes a smaller and smaller percentage. But, in spite of the forks, there are a few things that the vast majority will never allow to change. That being the confirmed transactional history and the total number of Bitcoins.
Going forward a bit, I do not condemn traditional banking in an absolute sense. I simply believe that we are long overdue for an alternative to the monopoly. And, just as people should be free to choose whatever suits them for whatever purpose, that does not mean that someone has to be an absolute one way or another. A person can have a MSI desktop, an Apple laptop, and an Android smartphone. All are computers and each has their utility. And, although I know you do not see cryptocurrencies as being useful for anything other than criminal activities, this is nonetheless how I view the matter. 
I'll be clear, however, and state again that I admit that it does not beat traditional banking. Yet. But, referencing what I mentioned prior. It is not about the now, but the potential for the then. Can it be used, albeit less efficiently that traditional banking in highly developed nations, to transfer money from person to person. Yes. But, is that deficiency an absolute that will hold true regardless of time. No. Or at least this is what I and others like me in the cryptocurrency space believe.
Also in regards to the motor car, it started off as a clunky mechanical mess that only the absurdly eccentric and rich would bother with. A horse was far superior in every regard and people would look at those that bothered with such a strange machine as being off their rocker. But, that did not hold true for long. Likewise, the radio, television, the internet, and even emails were not the obvious game changers that they are now as they were regarded back then at their start or inception. This notion, no matter how it may be wrong or misguided, is the heart of why so many are willing to dedicate so much time, effort, and wealth towards it.
But, yes, I know you disagree and indeed you have supported your stance well and skillfully. Yet, this my perspective and for better or worse, I am willing to take the risk.
@_date: 2019-09-28 05:34:32
In my first reply here, I have already cited why central banking fails and continues to do so. If you disagree look back to 2007 and look at the state of things now. Not exactly ideal is it. And, no you did not definitively prove that central bank is absolutely superior to a decentralized system. Citing history towards a failing system proves nothing. Times change.
Value is subjective. There really isn't a point debating that. And, as there is a cost to mining Bitcoin (time, hardware, electricity, maintenance, etc) to claim that there is nothing justifying the current value is a bit off and counterproductive. Fiat is government backed. But, a government derives it power from the people. If people choose to move towards cryptocurrencies, then that government backing goes with it.
Online gambling has a centralized platform that can be attacked. Even if they shutdown the exchanges, there are ways around it. Even if they demand businesses not to accept it, people still can and do. Even if they round up all the leading/known developers, the code is open source and will just come back. Comparing it to online gambling is off. A more apt comparison is towards pirating. And, yes I know, illegal purposes. But, has online pirating stopped? 
No, I have not put all my money into cryptocurrencies. No fool would put all their eggs in one basket. But, if you are asking whether I have invested money in cryptocurrencies. Of course I have, and not more than I can afford to lose. And, frankly, I would be a fool not to. 
It does not and should not be an absolute fiat or crypto nor should it be. 
As to the money transfer example, I suppose Bank of America might be to blame for my experience there, as I had used it a few times to transfer money to some associates overseas. A week might be a slight exaggeration. But, they certainly took far longer than I would have liked and the cost wasn't exactly favorable either.
Simply because the traditional system has a long standing history and has experts supporting it, does not mean that it is not flawed. And, it most certainly is. Nor does it mean that we should settle for it and accept that there is no room for change. People do not work that way. 
I cannot definitively prove that cryptocurrencies, as they are now, are definitively better than fiat or central banking. Especially, if the previous example is falling on shut ears. But, do you honestly believe that there is nothing to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology? That it is all just vaporware? Nothing useful at all?
But, look, I get it, you do not see it as being anything more than a nerdy pipe dream, a pyramid scheme without a future. Perhaps, you have chosen to engage here because you feel inclined to warn newbies/others of the perceived shills and malcontents trying to con people of their money. Perhaps, you or a person you cared for spent way too much at the wrong time and lost your savings. Yet, there are such things as differences in perspectives and beliefs. And, there will always be those willing to take a chance in spite of and because of the risks.
Take care, mate. I apologise if I antagonized you. But that was not my intention.
@_date: 2019-09-27 05:26:06
On a fundamental level, the value of something is based on precisely what people perceive as being valuable. Some may argue that the current value, ignoring the history behind it, of gold is justified due to it being useful for electronics. But, that argument falls flat when faced with the reality that it is far inferior when compared to other materials of greater rarity and yet far lower value. Diamonds are another example of something being ridiculously overvalued and they, despite the marketing behind is, are quite common. It is very much a case of believing something has value, claiming the past proves it, and marketing/shilling to others to keep it that way. This is how it has always been.
Now, going to your example regarding food, tools, and weapons. This is not an example of intrinsic value. It is subjective value and one based on circumstances of supply and demand. In fact, it can be argued that intrinsic value does not exist and what is claimed to be intrinsic is simply what the majority agree is valuable. 
That said, what makes Bitcoin different? The fixed supply? The history? The mysterious inventor? The code? Well, yes on the code, but not quite getting to the heart of why Bitcoin has enthralled so many. The reason is decentralization. In many ways the internet can be considered the first successful decentralized network towards knowledge. And, likewise, Bitcoin can be considered the first successful decentralized network towards money. It is a marvel to dive into and I strongly recommend the talks by Andreas Antonopoulos and some foundational knowledge through sources like  and  The fact of the matter is that the more people that get involved and contribute to the network the harder it is to compromise. At this point, it is agreeably the most difficult thing in the world to hack (10 years and over 20 million programmers and yet here it stands) and by solving the problem of digital scarcity via blockchain, aside from other area, it has much to offer the world.
Cash is not quite the safe bastion that we have been led to believe. In fact many would argue that the primary difference between central banking and the prospects that cryptocurrencies offer is that one is centralized (their private digital ledger) and the other is not (our global public digital ledger). Most of the cash in the world is stored digitally, only a small fraction is actually printed, and with such methods as fractional banking, the cash available in the world is supported by less than air and is in fact the reason why global debt is so insanely out of control.
Do you know why Bitcoin was created? Do you know the impetus behind it? The reason is that we almost faced a global financial catastrophe in 2007 and with the Fed, amongst others centralized dictators, literally printing out hundreds of Billions supported by absolutely nothing. They are simply stalling the inevitable from a mess they created. We are still very much on the verge of disaster. And, it is for that reason that more and more people are shifting their attention towards the decentralized option.
You have pointed out the wild rollercoaster in regards to the price of Bitcoin. The primary reason for that is due to what is happening with the dollar and a possible shift towards a substantial change is never going to be a smooth ride. You have also mentioned that their are places without the internet. But, do you realize that we as a global community have and continue to shift and rely more and more on the internet and the digital space? Also, it is far easier to set up a digital wallet or even a full node on a smartphone than it is to offer banking to the poorer parts of the world.

Value is determined by what the majority collectively agrees is valuable and what was described as "constantly throw money into the system to maintain" describes Fiat as well. 
Fiat is the older system, whose advocates, being well versed in the mechanics therein, detest the notion of learning to play a new game and starting over as novices. But, why fix what is not broken? It has worked for so long and despite obvious shortcomings, being behind the times and lacking modern features, is the tried and true method. So what is the issue?
The problem is that it is broken. Invariably, power corrupts and the centralized system in place, with no alternative and unable to fail as a result, has become lethargic and overbearing to the point where the world almost faced an economic crisis in 2008 and is likely to face a global recession in the coming year. 
Bitcoin is brilliant because it 1) presents a competitor to the monopoly 2) found a solution to the inevitable corruption of power 3) evolves through majority support.  I believe this might help to give a better, though somewhat silly in style, introduction: 
Still, the fact that it involves a considerable investment in manpower, electricity, and equipment, does give Bitcoin value and to get fair value for that work is fair. Also to claim that it is derived from thin air or nothing (as is the vernacular) is fundamentally wrong for just because something is digital and cannot be held in hand, does not mean it does not exist. I suppose to an extent one could think of it as an ingame currency, like what exists for most games and mmos, except that this one can be used by anyone with an internet connection, has no central authority, and is safeguarded and used by every Bitcoiner across the world.
It truly is a wonder, a system that works/maintains/updates itself not because trust is given, but because not a single person involved absolutely trusts anyone else in the system. In truth, I am one that believes that we should have had a pure digital currency ages ago and will admit that Bitcoin may not be the end product. In fact, it might be considered a step along the way, much like how we went from cassettes to cds with many steps before and after. But, as it is digital, it could prevail, due to its capacity to adapt and improve. Besides, as the underlying technology is globally praised, Bitcoin may retain value regardless as being the first application of the technology.

@_date: 2018-12-22 19:01:53
Let's see...
1 &amp; 2. True, it would only take a small tweak to the code to render all asic miners useless, but this has less to do with the core developers being resistant to change, and more to do with the inherent flaw of a decentralized system (democracy), which is that the majority (millions across the globe) determine the evolution of Bitcoin, and they want their miners to work.
3. True, but that does not condemn Bitcoin, as ignorance of the masses is why we have people that believe the earth is flat, vaccinations are bad, etc. It is basically an underlying problem in just about every subject there is.
4. False. It is true that there is an overwhelming favor towards the current developers, but Bitcoin is global. If you honestly believe that there are no developers outside this group that are interested and/or are currently working on proposals for amendments/improvements to the code, then you really need to take a good hard look at your third point.
5. Going back to why Bitcoin is resistant to change, we will never have a scenario where the majority would accept more than 21M for that would devalue the worth of the current 21M, which they would definitely oppose. Other coins do not have the advantage of the first mover or for that matter a 10 year history of success against the odds. This is why any serious developer that does not go the way of the con, like Ver and Wright, would prefer to support the way of the Bitcoin. This is not to say there are no other legitimate coins/developers, of course there are, just that there is little point in reinventing the wheel.
I will say, however, that at some point, Bitcoin, much like anything else and possibly fiat in the mid term, might be replaced. But, that is just the nature of the game and how mankind should progress, for we will never have meaningful change without meaningful sacrifice. Kingdoms fall, Empires fade to oblivion, but Humanity continues onward, stronger and better each time. In truth, we must be brave enough to fight for our future, rather than stagnate in a cesspool of mediocrity while consumed by an ocean of endless entertainment/distractions/bullshit that has come to embody the current status quo for humanity. So what if Bitcoin is not the end of the journey. Even as a small step, it is both monumental and significant, for it is a sign that our kind still has some youth, some vitality, and has not yet reached such a wretched stage of decay that a slow death is all that awaits us.

Okay, first an introduction to Bitcoin and the principles behind it, as well as the history of money and how it exists today:
Now, regarding hardware wallets, Trezor, and to a lesser extent Ledger, have a level of trust amongst crypto holders that could be compared to the level of trust that central banks once had before 2008. As long as you properly safeguard the keys and passwords, there is about as much as risk as your crypto being stolen as there is for a two month old baby to rob a bank with a pacifier. As to cryptos vanishing, well that depends on whether you believe in Armageddon, because that is pretty much what it would take for the legit cryptos supported across the globe by millions to disappear without a trash. And, in that scenario, fiat and the survival of the human race is very much up in the air.
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:56:15
Hmm, if you can survive without selling, then HODL. If you need to settle debt, then only sell as much as needed. Always remember, even if something might be worth a lot more in the future, if you kill yourself during the wait, then that potential gain is worthless.

@_date: 2018-12-25 16:39:44
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:29:41
True, except that it does not represent risk in the long term, but risk in the short term, and does not factor time. Ex. If you had to choose between getting 10K (no risk) versus gambling on a 50% chance of getting 100K (risk), the wiser choice would be to take the 10K. But, what if you could make that choice 10 times in a row? Do you go for the instant 100K or do you take the risk? There are no guarantees in life and when you risk nothing, you gain nothing or at least nothing much. But, though failure is far more common than success, we gamble against the odds because time will eventually reward those with the courage to push forward and will leave only a single rotting bird carcass to those that choose to sit on their laurels and do nothing.

Hmm, going to give a bit of roundabout advise. It is easy to look at your savings and think "this money is just sitting here doing nothing" as well as "I should put it all into Bitcoin and get rich long term" as well as "I can surely wait, unlike those shortsighted sodlers". 
But, once you do that, you fall into the gamblers dilemma. First your savings are gone and you no longer have the freedom to spend your money as you want because you have no money to spare. Second, you also find yourself increasingly drawn towards borrowing money and going into debt to get the high of having "free/spare" money to gamble. 
This is a slippery slope and the reason why newbies get crushed and turn from "haha, I can surely hodl, what's so hard about that, such fools to give up" to "this waiting is torture, why won't the price go up, I am fated to be rich, destiny calls, but why won't the price go up, oh I know it is because I haven't put in enough money, fate is postponing the moon for me".
That said, it is a good idea to get into Bitcoin, yes. But, pace yourself. Do not go all in and take the time to turn a fleeting interest into a passion by researching the technology at your own pace.

Dr... Oh god the pain, the shamelessness that Ver and that blowjob infected into the Bitcoin community and how they destroyed any semblance of trust/validity on B-Cash is sickening.

First, gonna have to be a bit of a gramma nazi and point out that the plural of Bitcoin is Bitcoin. 
Second, I apologise, but it is very important to make sure. But, you bought Bitcoin (BTC) and not the Altcoins BCH or BCV, right?
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:37:03
Umm, because they collectively forgot to take their stupidity pills?

Bitcoin is the first application of the blockchain technology and basically receives a lot of hate from the old dogs for their short-sightedness and having their lauded expertise and experience being put into question. They cannot for the sake of their collective egos admit that they are 1) wrong 2) too late to gain sufficient ground in Bitcoin to maintain their status quo 3) face the horror of being level 1 again after enjoying level 100 for decades.

I have to confess that I was geared to downvote and roast this. But, in retrospect, you raised a bloody good point. As a lover of history, as well as the lessons/stories/repetitions therein, I must give you props for the clever observation and inference.

It is the astrology of the financial world. Except, as value is based on what people determine is valuable, the more people that believe in this pseudo science that claims basic statistical analysis = prediction of human behavior = nostradamus, the more likely the market will behave in accordance to their "predictions".

I think it may also have to do with so many people begrudging the fact that they bought Bitcoin at highs and lost a lot of money. And, though we can point out the consequence of greed, wherein they invested beyond what they can afford to lose, and the trial of patience, being resolute to either go down with the ship or fly to the moon. The fact remains that a large majority regret their decision going in and felt like shit when they tearfully left with their tails between their legs. And, these same people, now believing that they were fools for getting into the crypto space also do want the price of Bitcoin to go back up because that would again lead to another rollercoaster of regret and feeling like absolute shit. It is unfortunate, but we may need the price to dive further and for the collective majority to forget about Bitcoin, before the diehards can see further improvement to the code and new highs once more.

BitMex works for me, as long as you do not get greedy and keep an eye on the liquidation price, can make a profit.

Hmm, it would go back to the barter system with each figuring out what the other considers valuable. Ex., If the Aliens found literal shit to be of more useful than gold, then we would probably start by trading shit for gold with each working in their own currency and other commodities/technologies in the process. Hell, who knows, bull shit might end up saving the world.

This list is incomplete, we need the experts predicting prices on the other end of the spectrum, and thus achieve enlightment by walking the middle path while mocking both ��

Trust, this is the crux of the issue with the banking system and why we need a competitor/alternative to the monopoly. 
In fiat, you trust the banks to be a competent dictator, yet the world is in debt to itself because money is printed with nothing to support it, except for the faith our governments and people must place on it, lest we face a complete and utter global economic collapse. And, despite being forced to believe in this system, we faced a global crisis in 2008, where Bitcoin was born, and are very likely entering a global recession next year. 
To an lesser extent, the truth of their corruption revealed itself when banks and credit cards began blocking cryptocurrency purchases on the basis of protecting their clients from risking their money on a "highly volatile digital asset with no intrinsic value and is used for money laundering and other illegal activitues". Yet, where were they when people spent thousands on mobile games like clash of clans, candy crush, etc; where were they when their clients sent money to a handsome prince in africa; where were they when they gambled it on online poker or any other form of gambling, which may or may not be legal where their clients are from; where were they when jimmy spend untold amounts of his parents money on lootboxes for his favorite games; where were they when people subscribed to various suspicious and morally questionable sites/programs; where were they when their clients withdrew ridiculous amounts of cash, the far superior and popular means by which to commit heinous untraceable crimes, and where were they when clients deposited a ridiculous amount of what could be considered blood money. Where were they?
Sigh, to be frank an ideal replacement does not exist, but cryptocurrency has the potential to become one for many reasons, but one that stands out the most in my books is this. A true cryptocurrency works not because trust is given, but because no one trusts anyone or anything else absolutely. It branches and evolves based on what the majority want it to be and it supports itself by every individual in the system protecting and maintaining it against foul play.
@_date: 2018-12-29 06:44:43
Hehe, but that, my friend, is the nature of the game. Bitcoin may be a small step or it may go up a few more, before something inevitably replaces it. But, that is just how it is. Cassettes to CDs to DVDs to Online, Feet to Horses to Cars, Etc. It is the pursuit for greater heights towards the unknown that makes life worth living.

Ah, I agree, except that this is the price of freedom, taking full responsibility for what we own. But, where that is concerned taking secure backups, through various mediums, of the seeds and passwords is all that is really needed, although where inheritance is concerned, there will certainly be issues when that comes into play, which may also be considered a drawback of a trustless system. And, yes, not only having the code evolve further, but having the masses learn more and join; not only because they want to get rich (because, truthfully, as revolutionary as this is, we are trying to introduce a competitor to the monetary system), but because they believe that mankind has the potential to be much more than a slave to a system of debt and mediocrity; is key.

In agreement with what was stated, but there is an additional goal that needs to be met. We need to stop using words like "buying" or "selling" and instead use "exchanging" with regards to Bitcoin. We need to fully internalize the notion that we are not buying something like a stock or a collectors item, but are rather exchanging one currency for another. Example, I did not buy -however much USD- worth of BTC while the price was low, I exchanged -however much USD- for BTC while the rate was in my favor.

I am a long term bull, existing as a short term bear, hoping for it to break the 3K line, but starting to feel that 3.1K may be the bottom? Hmm, either way good, pity about greed though.

Hmm, I am not sure if this will help, but I had a similar situation with a Trezor Wallet. I entered the keywords and the balance showed zero. I was in full blown panic mode and tried restoring the wallet using every possible way my "clever" self might have jumbled the written order, but nothing. At some point, however, I decided to  try the first sequence of words again and when prompted to enter a password for the "new" wallet, I entered the same one I used before, and lo and behold, my wallet was back.
You probably checked this already, but no harm:
