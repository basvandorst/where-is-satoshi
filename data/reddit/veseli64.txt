Also, Bcash leaders are constantly manipulating and deceiving public and community (especially newcomers) on all media (Twitter, Reddit, Bitcoin.com) about true nature of their highly centralized coin, claiming that Bcash is “true Bitcoin”. If you believe in their propaganda, you deserve everything that is going to happen to you. Sorry for being rude, but I can’t stand this type of people, liars and manipulators did a lot of damage thorugh the human history. Fortunatelly, the truth usually wins at the end.

Heroes are made through misery, pain and suffer. It’s remarkable time we live in - I almost enjoy this crash because It is testing my deepest emotions. So far - so good. Bitcoin is a fucking Phoenix.

And this fee will be payed out in a day or two just with the increase of BTC price. Bch fans enjoy to forget this fact, but Btc holders know very well why they are investing their money in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:39:32
And if Bcash become “real Bitcoin”, then this sleazy creature is supposed to lead the global revolution and win the final battle with bankster’s monster for the sake of all humanity?? Yeah, we are all fucked big time if this happens and Bitcoin dream is over for good

At this very moment Bitcoin is suffering from its “success desease”. We have had similar problem in my country some 10-12 years ago when tourists all around the world “discovered us” and started to visit in hoards - our higways to our beautuful coast were simply not wide enough, causing massive road blocks and waiting. All we could offer them was - patience and apologies. However, it was clear that we have to do something about it because we will lose them in incoming holiday seasons. So we did it. I am very optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, but solution for this problem must be provided ASAP.

Bitcoin is logical store of value (and one day a payment system) for the generation of young people whose noses are most of the time stuck in their smartphones. Their perception of something digital to have an instrinsic value is much more developed than mine (I am 53 years old). So, for a digital generation - the digital tool.

In general, you’re right, but the trick is probably in this: how will you decide that this dip, rolling in front if your eyes, is deep enough for you to buy?

If you have more than 1000$ in BTC, I suggest to buy a hard wallet (Trezor, Ledger) - invest 100 $ to protect your portfolio. Than simply send BTC to Trezor, hodl and wait until dust settles after 2X fork.

Nobody saw this “Bazinga” at the end of announcement?
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:44:29
If you intend to buy some more in the future - absolutely YES

I think MySpace was DigiCash
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:46:41
And suddenly you realize you can buy more than 100 BTC
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:19:28
So, what are you waiting for? Buy and hodl! My advice: after transaction move your BTC from desktop/mobile wallet as soon as possible into hard wallet - Trezor highly recommended.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:34:40
Fuck it, consider this: when (not IF!) BTC reaches 100k, you will earn around 90k instead of 93k if you bought it like a month ago.

More like e-prepaid Amazon gift card, nothing new, as I understand video, one can’t buy nowhere but in/at Amazon.

Let’s put it this way: would you buy tommorrow something valuable (let’s say - a car) and pay for it in BTC or in € or $? If you a BTC believer, you probably predict that your 1 BTC in a few months will be much worth than today. So, you would keep your Bitcoin and buy a car for Fiat (through loan or leasing)? If it’s correct why to worry about fees and scalability at this moment? Lightning Network is in the way, 
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:20:15
The short-term destiny of BTC is to become a premium store of value and to change the way people act in market economies today: spend, spend, spend, like there is no future... Every hodler of BTC already knows what I am talking about. In the middle-term I expect Lightning Network (or something similar) to be upgraded on the original BTC code, making the whole BTC ecosystem more like currency-lookalike network. Of course, in close collaboration with a few other crypto - ETH first. In long-term I expect of crypto to become mainstream globally adopted payment solution, side by side with fiat and plastic (they will slowly vanishing due to their inferiorities) and lot of governments will implement their national crypto valutes, trying to compensate global influence of Blochain-based independent crypto.

About BTC: YouTube channel aantonop (Andreas M Antonopoulos), the best promotor of Bitcoin, good soul of community. Try videos with phrases like Introduction, Beginner in titles

If you want to order 1TB or 2TB version it’s saying “Out of stock”. Probably very good news

I understand newbies can be annoying asking the same question again and again and again, but, what the hell, dude? Aren’t their rookie-investments are rising the price of your BTC? The more of us - the greater BTC? So, save your nerves and be polite, dude - remember, you were also begginer once...

If people don’t start USING their GOLD its going to burst. If people don’t CASH-OUT part of their GOLD it is going to burst. Looks logical?

Well, during last 7 years Butcoin simply by hodling (and partially by day trading) made from 0 to 8200 $. If something is scarce, hard to buy and very limited in supply, there’s naturally appreciation of its price. And BTC is probably the best asset in history acc to that criteria.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:15:27
10k when BTC marketcap will be around 40% higher than today, 15k when doubles today’s cap, 20k when triples... depends on market - if big wall street money enters BTC by january 2018, we can expect all these levels before summer of 2018
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:10:14
Why would you sell? It’s investment for future, savings for old days, retirement fund etc. In 5-10 years the crypto ecosystem could be so developed that your personal portfolio will be used as the foundation for all of your financial activities (loans, mortgages, schoolarships...) and fiat currency may be slowly vanishing - that’s especially valid for cash. Think outside the box, possibilities are unlimited.

Exactly this - “Bitcoin is disruption”, Andreas’ speech on TED, find it on YouTube and extract most simple and important things from first 14 and last 2 minutes of this fantastic lecture and you have your speech

If / when this announced derivative CME fund (and many those to come) reaches few billion $, then I expect the FUD on some strict and drastic USA regulation on BTC to decline, because Wall street players have more than enough influence on policy makers. “Do not mess with our new favourite toy...”
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:22:30
Now hold still and enjoy the ride. My suggestion: move it into hard wallet (my choice is Trezor), you can claim for all future forking coins from it. Minimize any risk / that is the most important advice.

I also can not help myself, but I am doing my best to keep my mouth shut, unless somebody ask me about BTC. Then the pipe opens and I am able to talk about it endlessly. I also notice one thing: recently I stopped reading newspapers and following my country local politics and events - I am all in global economy and politics, history of money (Austrian vs Keynesian economics), trying to predict future moves of big game players (USA and EU administration, Putin, China etc) regarding Bitcoin. Actually, it’s funny how Bitcoin changes man’s behaviour and character...
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:31:25
Wonderful parallel with Bitcoin. But, who to interview about BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:27:54
Find some data on web about amount of capital invested in “Derivatives” and suddenly you will realize that current 117 billion $ invested in BTC is literally a pocket money (so is the price of 7000 $). We are talking about Trillions of $ that would try to find a way investing in BTC and crypto, but this money does not come by itself - regulation, security, etc. Although I despise Wall street money-wizards, yesterdays announcement of this CME futures fund starting to bet on BTC prices - from my point of view - will minimize future FUD of Btc ban or destructive regulation. Once Wall street starts to play with something, the object of their game is “protected”.

Well, Andreas is optimistic about Lightning Network and I personally have a great trust in his predictions. However, I do not see need for any rush towards currency status for BTC, there is enough investment in its storage of value status for now. We are in early stage, adoption of disruptive technology like Blockchain must take some time, it is better make it so smooth as possible.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:16:30
Consider this: if you enter today with 500 $ (if you can afford this amount), and hodl through the years on this manic rollercoaster, one day - when 1 BTC will be worth 1 milion $ - you will have 67.000 $. Everything I have learnt about Bitcoin so far ensures me that it is possible. Watch a lot of remarkable videos on You Tube channel of famous Andreas Antonopoulos, follow professor Saifedean Ammous and hear what he predicts, read a lot about BTC, learn, inform yourself and make your own conclusions. Good luck!
