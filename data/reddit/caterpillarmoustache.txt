There are breed specific rescues. Idk about this breed in the OP, seems pretty unusual. But I'd imagine there's one for huskies. Our family got our border collie from a border collie specific rescue about 6 years ago this month. She's wonderful and healthy. She was taken into the rescue as a puppy when she was found wandering the streets of some city in Tennessee before she wound up with us in Pennsylvania. Always wonder what her back story is ...

She was super smart. Her personality was like if a human was stuck in a dog's body. Like "you want me to sit for a treat? well, if you insist." Just so much going on in her eyes. Every day without her is tough, but it's slowly getting better. Can't believe it's already been 5 months since we said goodbye!

My Australian Shepherd/black lab mix just passed away this summer at 14 years old, she was just the best!

Yeah, our family had had her since I was 11. I'm 25 now. A lot happens in those 14 years! She was there for *everything*. As I'm sure your pup has been for you. Hug her tight!

What happened to that nut guy?

Well yeah you can't blame coinbase for a delay if you don't have any money in the bank account you're trying to transfer from

The bank transfer takes several days. (For me, 7.) But you buy at the current price of bitcoin and it it goes up in those 7 days, then you have still profited. So it's no big deal really if you're intending to hodl.

I think he means when the price is like 200k, it will change by 10k-20k easily.
