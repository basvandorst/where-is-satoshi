These other protocols would have to be different side chains, due to the limited size, correct?   I'd think each side-chain be a form of binary trie.

I'd suggest a button on the Payment: Bitcoin page that shows another QCode that is a url to a very very easy to use online wallet (like blockchain.info), or a url to your local phone's wallet (browser or app) -- not sure about others, like coinbase.
actually, this makes me think a new URL schema (e.g. http:) could be used for this -- like mailto:  but instead pay: or bitpay:  ... then your local computer/phone/tablet can forward the link to the appropriate app/plugin.
Will you open source it?  We are coders here.

What do you define as the internet? TCP/IP + DNS? Ethernet + Intranets?  VPNs?  Point being, altcoins can have meaning, it all depends on what unique feature each brings to the table.   Perhaps one altcoin that can wrap around all other altcoins ,and proxy their unique features, will be the end-game for the altcoin scene.

A miner but an algorithm dispatcher.  Blockchains, being simply a multi-master transactional database, can use techniques beyond what you mention.  Even Leslie Lamport proved his the idea of voting for distributed systems was not of the best design. 
Do you see any reference to mining [here](
Still, I do understand the current carrot approach to validating using incentives.

I guess litecoin: and other coins can have their own (or overwrite the bitcoin: scheme default app)
@_date: 2014-04-10 01:43:51
I also think people hate bitcoin, not just for ignorance, but the little they have heard of it, it has been in shady/controversial situations, giving it a bad name.   Also, it is hard to believe in something if my corner convenience store doesn't accept it (for example).

I guess I still don't understand sidechains -- they have a smell about them I can't put my finger on.  Why have chains upon chains and not a b-tree like structure.

I think you oversimplified what I was trying to say.  There is always fraud and inflation wrt any particular currency, its just a matter of time.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:21:19
Fiat is a latin word meaning "let it be done", as in an official decree.
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:10:02
I guess it should have been called Bitnet from the start then.  Perception is everything and its name concludes this.

* there is 50/50 chance for son vs. daughter
* 1/2 of all new parents will have one daughter
* all new parents, if they don't stop until one son is born, will have at least one son.
thus, more sons than daughters are born.   Is that correct solution?
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:45:41
You can simplify the word rewards into use.  For bitmessage, the reward is using it -- cause and effect.  Its important to see what people are doing with blockchains before being so conclusive.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:17:20
So then primecoin isn't fiat.

Sounds like you like the challenge of learning about something and dive full into it, being the researcher you are (me too).  That isn't something to be ashamed of.  You will snap out of it once you find your next big interest.

This is EXACTLY why LTC could be the same value in USD as BTC in one year.  The markets don't care about differences except price.

One problem with bitcoins are the altcoins.  If there are 1,000 different cryptos, with the top half being of same value (per), then currency inflation and accouting fraud (e.g. blockchain backdoors) will most definitely occur without being detected.  I think this a very possible future (e.g. Ripple, HoboNickels).
