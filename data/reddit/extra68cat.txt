What I think will happen is a visa type company (or Visa themselves) will allow bitcoin deposits like a pre paid Visa but with bitcoins instead of cash (maybe even a line of credit).
Then you buy the donut with your Visa Bitcoin card and your VB account is deducted one donut. Maybe once a week the entire VB customer account total is sent to the blockchain.
That or someone figures out a FAST distributed block chain layer tech that does not rely on centralization to buy a donut.

If the math works out and you sell at the ATH and then buy back with it dips to 1/3 of your value, you could easily 50x your current holdings of coins. Then wait 1.5 years for it to recover and cash out at 100-150x.

To be technically correct, bitcoin could have more than 21 million coins if a consensus was met and it was coded in. 
     
Then again the only reason to do that vs adding another decimal place is to 'help' people get over that weirdness in their brains thinking 1 coin is too expensive.
I look forward to the day when using Satoshis as a common method of talking about how many bitcoins something is/costs makes sense. 180ish Satoshis to the penny means we are not there yet.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:01:05
I can think of a few examples where an entity (miners) would sabotage something (bitcoin) even though it costs them money in the short term. If the end game gives them control over a multi trillion dollar market, it makes sense to risk $50 million.
Once you have 50 million to burn on a bet than can pay off in the 100s of billions, you do it, what else is there to do (keep playing small ball)?
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:51:04
You are using a PC connected to the internet to encrypt your file.
You need to generate a private key offline on a PC -not- and -never- to be connected to the internet (ideally a PC formatted from scratch that has never been online which you can get for $100 it can be the shittiest PC in the world).
Then send a test amount to the address the private key is tied to.
Once that is confirmed and you 100% know the key by confirming it multiple times and then writing it down (in metal and paper) then store that paper/metal with the key somewhere safe (in 2 homes not the same home). You can add simple offsets to the private key to stop a real world thief from being able to figure it out.
Then when you want to cash out, you get the core wallet, import the private key and then send the coins to an exchange for cash or use them directly or give the person the entire key for cash or whatever.
Its cold storage outside of the internet (even hardware wallets have been hacked at the hardware level).
This is a pain in the ass but once you get to a level of coins that is concerning to you, you should do this to be safe. Alternative is you fire up your PC one day and find 0 coins in your wallet.

Rapid exponential adoption is what is behind this, not a bubble. 
    
400% aint shit, we will hit 1000 and 10000% before it levels off at actual widespread adoption/ownership/usage. 
    
100k by Dec 2018 is easily within reach now, but by all means sell me your current coins for 4k in a month if you think this is a bubble. Would be nice to set up a contract for you to have to sell me your coins at 4k in 30 days.

Not a single person on the planet knows the answer to that.
So that leaves you with a guess and both are possible/probable (wait vs buy now).
So you want the coins and are you looking for a quick 10% and sell or do you want 20x? If you want 10% good luck, if you want 20x then buy now and ignore the coin for 5-10 years.

Price can increase without money being brought into the system. A lack of sellers leads to price increases with people putting in a single penny.
    
When it crashes that 'fake' money evaporates just as easily as it was brought into existence.
    
This is not a horrible bad think but simply a facet of how we decide a thing has a certain value.

40k screw ups suck ass.

For $100 it is not worth the fees and hassle, just leave it there. When you get to a level that would hurt if it is lost then educate yourself on wallets and securing private keys.

6 years ago you would not think you would pay $7000 for a single bitcoin but here you are.

The FED creates debt as well.

So true in the stock market.

It is being worked on as I type this (two staff members are working on it).
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:58:10
Yups and I would prefer not to have to do it this way but currently we 100% have to.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:54:56
Did you need the money or is it just sitting someone making .001 percent?
If you did not need the money, why did you sell when this has the potential for 10x or even 100x in a few years.
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:15:46
once you buy some bitcoin, watch this video and more in the series:
Your understanding will increase dramatically.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:18:23
Not true.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:58:39
And the dam broke :)
If we can sustain above 6k for 2 days then 7k becomes the next wall to butt up against.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:58:46
Just don't connect it to the net ever again.
Yes you can generate endless keys.
This explains it: 
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:36:31
It was a good explanation.
Once they grasp it all, then they should know about extreme edge cases, or not so extreme like bitcoin being forked and hijacked away from itself.
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:24:42
What if someone gets your SIM on their phone by bullshitting a service tech (happens).
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:40:03
I cost me a penny to send a dollar, it took a while but it went through in a couple hours.
Unless they want to stand around and confirm $5 then they won't care and would be happy to mine bitcoin by making crappy mexican food.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:08:02
Just bought more bitcoin. I am such a gambler.
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:18:59
You can easily grab the code to create a wallet offline in the nice form of a complete webpage.
Port it to an offline PC or laptop (an old crappy one). Fire it up, open the page, make the wallet and close down the page.
    
Do not re use the usb stick. 
    
The only possible way would be to go online on the PC and for their to be a screen capturing software or software designed specifically to recognize when the browser opens that specific code, then have screen caps set to be stored and transmitted when you reconnect.
All while that PC has been infected. If you do not connect that PC to the internet you are very very very safe.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:44:42
Second time breaking 6k is a great sign, 3rd time is best.
Money is flowing into bitcoin and not out over the course of weeks and the last few months, along with more and more hodlers.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:29:53
The reindex is the full download of the entire chain?
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:22:12
offline paper wallet nothing done with a pc connected to or will be connected to the net is perfectly safe.
An offline wallet (you could even salt it with a simple offset that YOU know) and you are very very safe.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:28:03
Not true, you can but puts and calls that pay off 10x in 30 days if they hit.
Bitcoin is not going to 50k by December.
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:56:38
I will take that bet.
Got 50 grand (not kidding) it will be the easiest 50 grand i ever made.
But you won't put up even a dollar because you know deep down you backed a failure.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:14:01
It was $1 but I wish I had tossed $10 at it. 50 grand would be some fun money.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:22:18
Yes but nothing is really 100% safe, just levels of safety.
Once you understand what it takes to steal a coin (the key) then think of every possible way someone could get the key, then put up barriers to stop them. Write down your key and swap every H and t for instance (just dont forget that you swapped them). Now they have to also break your encryption (simple yet effective cipher) and find your key and know what it is and be a bad guy and attempt to steal it...you get the idea.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:27:04
There are TONS of bets that pay off 100 or 200 to 1.
1000s that pay off 10 to 1
I got the Jets at 5000 to 1 for the superbowl, weird shit can happen.
Now dropping 5k into bitcoin back in 2011, that is once in a lifetime (or very rare).
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:13:34
You can buy some, its easy.
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:09:26


There are other incentives to do what you mentioned.
In fact you could name 3-4 different plausible reasons why an entity with enough resources would do such a thing. Any government could set up enough mining equipment and hire a decent knowledgeable crew to run them and crash/crush bitcoin if they wanted to do so. It would leave core with only one option, a roll back and to tweak the code to such a degree to make the coin's very nature completely different to thwart large scale attacks.
That said I am still buying more and more bitcoin because I doubt they will do it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:53:31
Found the racist.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:10:30
The limits on newcomers make it hard to plow 50 grand into bitcoin let alone 5 million.
Compare that to buying 5 million in stock and its easy to see the difference.
Things are getting better but its still slow.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:14:03
When the story of the guy spending 10k coins on pizza is heard by the new guy, he simply does not want to be the pizza dork of the future so he does not spend bitcoin on pizza (or much of anything else).
It will simply take time and price stability to convince the masses otherwise, complaining about reality won't help.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:20:34
Again not true, it takes around $1000 to open an trading account and you have access to buy puts and calls (not sell/create them).
It might even be less than $1000 now.
Its less complicated than crypto, very easy to look up the January 2018 put/calls for Amazon then buy way out of the money and if a big move happens you can land 10x or 30x even. You could even call them and have them walk you through it. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:10:56
It takes a shockingly small pile of cash to disrupt either chain substantially, 10 grand can make a big dent in an entire day, 100 grand and thats a week long attack. There are people are there that can afford to throw 10x or 50x that much at an attack on a gamble and if that pays off they come out 3-4 maybe 10x ahead.
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:27:40
Happens a lot that breaking a price the 3rd time creates a new 'floor'. Basically people become comfortable with this price being more legit is all. Happens at every large price milestone and it will happen at 7k too (monkey brains is why).
@_date: 2017-10-26 09:48:27
Ah yes that $10 is going to be missed.
If I put anything significant you might have a point, or if I had paid attention to nfl lines or sporting lines in the last month maybe that would indicate an addiction as well. Doing something once in moderation does not an addict make nor does taking a long shot pay out of 5000 to 1.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:05:09
Its a pain getting into bitcoin, they are in no rush to leave.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:59:49
Good luck getting my coins out of my offline generated cold storage.
People keeping them on exchanges will lose them.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:57:36
There is only around 16 million mined, 1 million+ of those sat in the same address since day one, 1 million+ have most likely been lost.
That leaves 14 million over half of which are perma hodlers.
Owning a single coin even today is not easy, hence the 6k price and 25k or 100k in the not too distant future.
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:52:52
Projecting much. Nasty nasty sore loser.
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:32:42
Multiple world currencies would use it to back their 'fiat' government issued currencies once it hits 1 million per coin.
The ones that do so first would be VERY VERY sought after.
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:54:50


Liar, you are the reason he won, your disgusting lies.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:52:35
Really should generate keys on an offline pc with well vetted code.
Or gamble and create keys on the PC you use to browse reddit and hope you do not have a keylogger or screen cap infection.
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:12:58
Not my blocker...does not even pop up to stop.
Your blocker is not a good one.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:32:31
I will be making a paper wallet offline for them.
Two copies (one I will keep), they won't be able to lose it, unless two homes burn down including the fire safe in their house (I should get one too...).
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:02:40
Back in the day, yacht money would have actually moved the price.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:11:22
Not very smart at all.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:42:02
They would have a QR code (their bitcoin address), you scan it and press send from your app.
