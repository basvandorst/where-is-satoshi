Stop destroying the narrative man

And you are not paid for copypasting the same BS in every thread all day every day huh?
What a shitshow this sub has become. All hail our great leader!

You were 100% right.
I was talking about the narrative of "BU getting busted", which is purely constructed.

I trust none of these people.
The way Bitcoin was designed incentivizes miners to act in a way that helps the currency. The greater their investment in hardware, the bigger is their incentive to grow the market cap and help adoption. Blockstream with their own vested interest have no such obligation and are therefore the least trustworthy.
I trust in Satoshis vision of a p2p electronic cash system, that's why I bought Bitcoin in the first place. To force Bitcoin into becoming a pure settlement layer is akin to purposely crippling it's potential.

But who is filling Gregs pockets?

Miners were ready to accept on-chain scaling to 2+MB over two years ago, the ones postponing and stalling things were our beloved Core developers. Signing the HK agreement with no intention of ever delivering on their promises, but we have already conveniently forgotten all this haven't we?
So either you are distorting reality or you can't comprehend it fully.
