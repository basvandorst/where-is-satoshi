Not even close to a fair comparison. Inflation due to money printing means very little, when changes in economic demands for that currency also factor into prices.
*Price* inflation is what really matters, and Bitcoin's ability to drop $50 (or rise $50) overnight means it has horibble, horrible inflation. That is downright awful for anyone trying to sell something, buy something, claim a paycheck, feed a family, etc. Have you ever seen anything priced in Bitcoin that isn't actually just a USD price converted to Bitcoin on the spot? That's how awful Bitcoin inflation is.
First-world fiat currencies have stable inflation 1-3%/year which actually means prices *will not* (in general) increase more than 3%/year. You can collect your US$500 paycheck and be able to actually buy $500 worth of stuff over the next two weeks. The demand for USD doesn't really change all that much, like Bitcoin does daily, hourly, etc. What $500 worth of Bitcoin now will be in two weeks is a crapshoot.
Until Bitcoin's userbase increases 10-fold and then an even longer time period passes to level out its value and demand, Bitcoin will have horrible, horrible price inflation. Considering Bitcoin's other flaws, that will probably never happen and you've got a chicken and egg problem, that the community refuses to fix because they see Bitcoin as perfect in every way already.

Should we free every convicted child pornographer in prison then? Or is it only the people you like that were framed?

Umm, no, you don't average them together. You pick a point in time, whatever point you want on the Bitcoin price chart. Pretend you got your $500 paycheck that day. Then you look at the price a week later, and see how much money you gained/lost. Then a week after that. I'm sure it's fun playing roulette with all of your money.


Yeah, your ship started sinking a long time ago and you guys will be debating which lifeboat is best until you're at the bottom of the seafloor.
