This is fascinating.  Now I'm tooling around with GUI miner and joining a few pools.  I'm still getting the hang of everything, but thanks to this community, I should be set soon!

I think I understand.  So I don't have to physically verify the transactions I'm getting, just wait for the system to verify it?
