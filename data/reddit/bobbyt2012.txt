Bitcoin core is now displaying my balance, but my wallet is encrypted and locked. I have a few passphrases, but I'm not sure if I can actually access it right now. It's syncing with the network still.
I tried installing Electrum, but that didn't get me anywhere yet.

I found two passphrases. One is labeled "electrum seed" and is dictionary words. The other is labeled "bitcoin passphrase" and is a long alphanumeric.

That was after the DEA discovered him though.  He laundered tons of money before that.

There is a big difference between living in a $1200/mo apartment with other people and living in a mansion.  I'm not saying how he should have spent is money, I'm just saying it's a bit peculiar that he didn't spend his money. 
I guess bitcoin might really only be anonymous when you're holding it and not exchanging it for cash or spending it.

These statements seem contradictory to me.

This doesn't make sense.  Bitcoin has no intrinsic value like gold does.  I don't see how using bitcoins rectifies the situation of not being able to send precious metals through the mail.

I mentioned that I got out while I could.  I think I have just north of a half left, unless of course it has been stolen or something.

The prof I have been talking to is a Berkeley alum, so I might have an in with this guy.

Thanks, I wasn't trying to gloat.  I just find it very strange and wanted to start a conversation about it.  
@_date: 2013-10-09 18:35:41
I don't know that he's a pyschopath - I was only posing the question.  I would think the people he was living with would have caught on a bit.

I still don't see where bitcoin comes into this equation.  If you can't get gold through mail, I suppose you can get it through more direct sources.  I've never had gold sent through the mail.  
I guess I see the use in anonymous exchange, although both parties have to be bitcoin users.  I've gotten off the bitcoin train.

I'm well aware if the risk / reward possibilities.  I was actually an ideal candidate for mining - I used a preexisting gaming computer and my university paid my electric bill.  The slower performance and excess heat were enough to decide that a few hundred bucks a month was barely worth it as it was.  Now that I can't exchange them to USD easily, I have no interest.  
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:32:30
That's something I'll have to ask about / look into myself.  I'm still in my undergrad, so I'll probably check our databases.
@_date: 2013-10-09 16:49:43
I'm saying you would expect consumption to rise with income.  
@_date: 2013-10-09 18:12:06
Thanks for the constructive response.  
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:09:24
I'm aware that it's a TV show, but it's kind of a good analogy.  
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:30:35
Higher standards like soliciting murder?  Maybe he is a psychopath, you can't really study irrationality.

They spent hundreds of thousands on cancer treatment, Hank's rehab, cars, etc.  I'm aware that you can't just deposit a few million dollars into a bank account and not raise any questions, but certainly you could funnel out enough money to live on your own?  
@_date: 2013-10-09 16:53:06
Why do it if you're not going to spend the money?  Why take such a massive risk if you aren't benefiting particularly well from it?  I'm sure he could have found a way to launder it somehow.  
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:11:56
I think 80 million dollars is good enough to get pretty far down the road.  I'm confused as to why someone would take on such an enormous amount of risk and not do anything to benefit from his accumulated wealth.
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:05:24
I haven't been into bitcoin nearly as much lately, and I was never fully informed about the technical side of things, but what would make the coins "drug" coins?  Isn't there anonymity?  
@_date: 2013-05-16 03:27:33
I support the idea of Bitcoin, but I'm not willing to mess with it at the moment.  I mined about 8 coins and now I've decided to stop.
Firstly, it isn't really even a currency at the moment.  It's value depends on the currencies it can be exchanged for.  Not many people really accept Bitcoin, they are only converting it to USD once they acquire it.  Bitcoin is now officially worthless to me, since I can't convert it to something I can use to buy stuff that I want.  Can't put it in my bank account anymore without a private sale.  To make matters worse, it has proven to be incredibly insecure and no parties are stepping in with high security clients as the market should be demanding.  Bitcoin is too young and reckless for me.  I'll take the downvotes, it's just a fact.  
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:07:27
I suppose that's possible - I would just assume that someone that age would splurge at least a little.  Maybe have more than "3 or 4 changes of clothing." 
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:51:14
No need to make this personal.  I'm simply pointing out the fact that, generally, income and consumption are positively correlated.  I'm not saying that I would expect this person to live in a mansion or buy Armani suits, I'm simply pointing out something that I don't think makes much sense.  
  
@_date: 2013-06-12 14:30:09
Is this some sort of philosophical argument?  I guess the point I was trying to get across was that gold is actually useful, while bitcoins are not.  A bitcoin cannot be used for anything (ie, you can't build a bridge out of bitcoins and you can't use them as conductors.) 
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:25:17
Of course you can question his motives.  I have a background in economics - that's what we do.  It's behavior economics, cost / benefit analysis, general principles like incentives, etc.  
@_date: 2013-10-09 17:54:05
I'm not accomplished...I'm simply pointing out the fact that behavior can be predicted with economic theory and this situation does not seem to fit any model. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:40:45
Thank goodness I got out of Bitcoin while I still could.
