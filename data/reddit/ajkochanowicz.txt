That's also the explanation he gave.

This is usually the closest to the coinbase index:

That is a funny "source", but  is correct.

Just don't back them up to a single location. You then create a single point of failure.

There's not much mystery here. He's annoyed by the reporters and is trying to tell them to shut up in a funny way. In this case, he's trying out some misremembered Russian. Instead of saying "ya nyeh gavreyoo angleeskee" he mixes up the German word "nicht" for "not".

Agreed, some folks on twitter are acting worse than how they accuse her for behaving.

Does this author mean to say that a fiat bank is less likely to be robbed than a bitcoin bank?
I don't think it's "easier" for the average person to rob bitcoins than dollars. The general public has enough trouble understanding how to just use them as intended.

"that" = engineering work, not Bitcoin. He said this himself.
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:59:36
I noticed this as well!
@_date: 2014-04-18 15:47:35
I assume 9.400 BTC is supposed to be 9,400 BTC?
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:25:55
This is great. Thanks for compiling it.
Clearly doesn't even know what the thing is:
1. "bitcom,"
2. "I have nothing to do with bitcoin. I never worked for the **company**"

Agreed. This is more of an attack on her gender than on the facts of what happened. Leave the ad hominem sexism out of this.

Should anyone be surprised? D. Nakamoto didn't himself say he was misquoted, he said that it wasn't what he meant when he said "I'm not involved with that anymore."
I don't think those who are angry with Newsweek think Goodman *lied* about the quotations, they think she drew hasty conclusions into facts, instead of an investigative report.

Omg, the tulip field has to be on purpose. Love it.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:39:13
In all sincerity, it's better proof than her fucking article.

Why can't I choose more than 1 person?

Unlike cash, I can put my BIP-encrypted paper backup directly in a thief's pocket and not worry about it being stolen.

I'm glad you posted this. I was also afraid of voicing some of these concerns in fear of being viewed as on the "other side." I'm pro bitcoin, but I think we should all acknowledge there are legitimate concerns we should take seriously.
For one thing, it is not a "good thing" Mt. Gox went under. I get what the argument is there, but Mt. Gox should have gone under due to losing customers. The fact that so many Bitcoins worth of "believers" now no longer have their value in circulation is a bad thing. That being said, I can see the silver lining to their no longer being around.

Damn. Doubting these folks are going to step down in 72 hours, I'm getting bullish.
@_date: 2014-06-19 21:37:09
I haven't seen this, thanks for sending it!
@_date: 2014-05-06 15:36:31

@_date: 2014-03-08 18:36:16
I also do that. OMG. Did we create bitcoin?

So what? He later stated he was referring to his engineering work.
@_date: 2014-08-03 04:56:20
Just some friends of mine.
