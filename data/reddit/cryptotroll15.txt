Word, thanks for your opinion!

I laughed as soon as I saw his post. I was like whelp, I bet shits going to hit the fan now.

Many reasons. Counter-party risk, Liquidity, government control, etc...

What is the amount of mining support needed for bip148?
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:24:04
Thanks for respondong. Yeah I get that it's user activated, but I'd imagine we'd need a degree of miner support after the activation to prevent a HF or something no?

I understand that, and I get where you're coming from. But with SegWit now on LTC, it should naturally pressure miners to signal segwit and give up both their asicboost advantage and willingly give up potential fees to the LN. Obviously I have no sympathy for loosing asicboost but the fees to LN are a legitimate grievance, even if it is for the greater good of BTC &amp; cryptos. That's something that they should do willingly IMO.
I fear that without consensus, USAF will force the hands of of dissenting opinions and we may encounter more harm than good. At least in the short term (months to years), or maybe it will be done without any issues. To say the very least, there is too much confidence around so much uncertainty.

I think it's reasonable to be skeptical and asking questions is rational. That is what critical thinking is. Ignoring critical thinking on the other hand...

pretty sure they're arguing UASF not segwit brew...

I'm pro segwit and all. But isn't that the same mentality of BIP148? Agree with us or else? Neither option is appealing to me. I will be on the sidelines while war is waged.

I mean, as I said. I'm not taking a side until the dust settles and there is clarity. If you're so concerned with governance, why don't you go to Decred until there is resolution.

Any side that is encouraging a chain split is not certain of the results, and is only hopeful. Forcing the community to choose because you think you're right is not consensus and rather contentious. This goes for the  both concepts, BU and BIP148.

Dont invest in bitcoin for profitable reasons, invest in the future. Youll drive yourself mad if you get hung up on day to day prices.
Find a good exchange that can process fiat.
Dollar cost average with weekly or bi-weekly purchases of a sustainable  fixed amount.  (Dont invest everything at once, slow and steady)
Understand that anything invested can  be lost. So be willing to part with your money. There are many different risks. (Dont invest what you cant afford to loose)
Always read something new everyday.  Whether that is news or technical information, like how to set up a wallet, how blockchain works etc. 
You dont own your bitcoin unless you own your private keys. Otherwise you own an IOU as long as the service provider stays solvent.

Everyone is trying to figure this out. There probably will be a hard fork. Imo it comes down to what Bitmain and Jihan supports to estimate how much impact it has.
There have been plenty of btc hard forks but there is only 1 btc
