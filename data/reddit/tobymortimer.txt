Are you retarded? They are risking their own money in the hope of financial gain. They ARE gamblers.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:29:29
I can gamble on a dice role where the odds are 5/6 I win; it's still gambling. You do not seem to understand. Whilst investing is more educated and predictable tham gambling; it is still gambling.

You have a better heart than almost everyone in this sub lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:24:40
Lots of risk with being jumped etc. and I want to be a law-abiding citizen because I don't want it to bite me in the ass
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:17
Fuck federal reserve, that's why
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:26:59
I completely agree with what you are saying UNLESS it is necessary e.g. irl problems such as a family member needing money for treatment etc. Otherwise, great PSA!

There was 400 btc wanting to sell at $14,000 which is a lot, beforehand when there were big sell walls, bitcoin would tend to fall in price. But instead, all 400 were bought in less than 1 minute breaking the resistance.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:59:17
Will definately be on good morning britain, hype hype hype!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:47

@_date: 2016-06-13 18:24:37

@_date: 2016-06-13 11:26:14
It's insane bro, hype is real
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:23:29
wow bro, thanks for this, this is supporting for me, I bought them as I am planning on bulk buying game items with them and re-selling the items for btc, but atm my money is in a mess and I was only able to get hold of 0.25 btc because of money in other investments
@_date: 2016-06-13 19:49:49
Im from the UK and it was for paypal rather than bank transfer and I this was literally the fucking cheapest I would have got it.
@_date: 2016-06-11 21:42:29
No idea, I'm actually looking to purchase some btc with the $215 I have in my PayPal as spare cash but might wait for the hype o die down after halving
@_date: 2016-06-23 06:47:56
God, I hope so xD
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:02:20
yeah I mean I re-invested yesterday/today so I payed $200 for 0.25 btc :/ advice?
@_date: 2016-06-13 15:38:15
Its the halving, its in like 4k blocks
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:25:59

@_date: 2016-06-13 18:30:55
Having a problem with someone stealing my steam api key :/ Global cooldown for 4 weeks until its all sorted, so I have 0.25 btc atm and when I can trade again I should have 0.5-0.6 btc and Im just gonna stick with it for a few months and start bulk buying and selling I was before!
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:00:30
Last chance to buy in 4 digits

For anyone wondering, it's  a SMOK vape pen 22 and I purchased it from purse.io using heisenberg the hidden mist liquid.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:29:49
You publicly said you have over $1mil in crypto and you didn't do it on a throwaway account? Hmmm
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:22:13
Actually it did, it just crashed afterwards.
@_date: 2018-11-04 10:18:24
I would do that but I'm 17, can't take out loans. But I do own a significant amount of it.
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:15:21
CSGO case keys to automated steam bots, using blockchain.info as a wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:20:40
So if i use electrum wallet, ill get both coins on the split and its more safe?
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:49:26

@_date: 2017-10-09 11:56:19
On all things decentral it works out to be $83, is it legit? should I buy from there?
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:35:23
No way I can recover them?
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:27:46
Welcome, hold your coins until at least 2020.
@_date: 2016-07-21 06:50:39

@_date: 2016-07-13 07:20:24
Alright thanks I'll look into it, i wa planning on buying from circle as it has better rates and is easier but I'll take a look
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:01:31
I can't help but I hope you get it back :)
@_date: 2016-07-12 17:20:42

@_date: 2016-07-12 15:39:04
right, so Im still a student and but have a job and make a decent amount, have enough to buy a lot but not sure whether I should just spend $50-$100 a month or something
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:57:34
go to places like circle or virwox etc. and you can purchase as little as you like if Im right
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:44:14
I mean, I really doubt it will but it is possible ofc so no, Ive been in a lot worse position but it would be a pain xD
@_date: 2016-07-12 17:07:46
Yeah I understand that, more of a long term thing with the mind set "fuck it, Im young :D"
@_date: 2016-07-20 16:45:52
250 thousand? Lol no
@_date: 2016-07-12 16:00:51
yeah, I believe circle has the 2nd best rates which is why Im using them as not to trusting of 
@_date: 2016-07-20 17:48:39
You're retarded
@_date: 2016-07-20 13:07:48
