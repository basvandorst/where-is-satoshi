Also, now that Bitcoin has become a "mainstream", or at least opened up to a whole new level of people, when will we start to see a whole new level of vendors and other places that are accepting BTC as a currency? As it was meant to be, or is it now becoming solely an investment option only?

BCH forked from the main blockchain (BTC) and everyone got equivalent BCH as they had BTC. Having BTC and BCH is basically like having euros and dollars in a physical wallet, they're completely separate.
Personally I'd just sell it, or perhaps most of it and just hodl the rest of the BCH ^just^in^case

It's strange, because surely its use as a currency would smooth out any peaks and troughs in value, since it will start to be tied to tangible items with set values. Thoughts?

Anyone know when trx fees will go down, or if there are any articles/links I can read that will educate me on the matter?
I'd also like to read some articles talking about the technical side that needs changing if anyone can link me, since I don't understand the issues causing the high fees, purely because I haven't read about the matter.
THanks :)

I own BTC based on my view that it has value as a means of trade that isn't dependent on a single organisation and can't be used by banks to do fractional reserve banking.
Please elaborate on what you see as BTC'S intrinsic value. As you've not really answered what I was asking, which was what is the driving force behind Bitcoins value if the vast majority of users on here and in the public only see it as a way to buy low, sell high.

Is there a BTC starter pack/document circulating with a bunch of links to good, quality content re: BTC that I can link to family/friends/strangers suddenly asking how to step 3) profit?
If not, I might make one that compiles everything that a starter would need to know. FYI, I know the sidebar has a wealth of knowledge, but I'm not sure how I'd feel about just redirecting the older generation of my family to lol.

Every BTC held when the fork occurred and BCH became a thing received an amount of BCH.
The BTC held by people on Coinbase is actually in Coinbase wallets, so the BCH has always been there, just not accessible on the consumer side. Now they're starting to open it up to the people who rightly own the BCH that came about from the BTC they owned at the time.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:03:11
If it becomes solely seen as security (I guess you could do transactions with it, but who carries out transactions with any current securities lol), then its value should continue to rise for at least the next few years.
Up until the supply of BTC meets the demand for it, at which point anyone can buy/sell it for a set price since no more can be mined. (Disclaimer: could be completely wrong, that's my 30 second interpretation lol)
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:43:02
Yep. A comment further up elaborates on why $1,000,000/BTC will come around before Block

No worries. And if you held 1.5BTC on 1st Aug, I hope you hodled/are still hodling at least some of it ;) congrats nonetheless
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:58:58
Will BTC ever be used as a currency as originally planned?? All I see now is people attempting to HODL and hoard for as long as possible, with literally no interest in ever using it as a means of payment to acquire things.
Not slating people who think this way, but doesn't that mean that BTC is rising in value based on hype, if there's no backing behind it being used as currency??
Inb4 FUD, I just wanna know how BTC can rise in value if it's still seen as a deflationary currency.

Investment only indefinitely? And that's true about the prices jumping about, but up until recently a lot of people have praised those "first movers" using it as a means of payment as opposed to an investment opportunity. Perhaps there's a paradigm shift in how people view BTC
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:28:10
95% of people here only talk about the price etc. No one talks about how they think Bitcoin will have value in the future as a standalone currency/commodity - just how it is valued in relation to fiat currency.
A bit sad really, but hey, feel free to prove me wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:20:32
Online commerce has boomed as a result of mass adoption of the Internet and it's value in widening the audience that you can sell to.
Bitcoin has made no difference, people who already shop online are the ones who have started to do even a little bit of spending with bitcoin.
I actually really believe in bitcoin, but this sub is effectively a place where people are just waiting to cash out of a pump and dump scheme

@_date: 2019-01-07 02:28:42
35-44 age group spans 9 years
19-24 age group spans 5 years
19-24 age group has nearly half as many people able to buy btc, as well as typically earning less than the former group. Hence 35-44 are the second biggest group

I'd imagine cash is at least marginally better than fiat deposited into a bank account.
Immediately usable to trade with others, even when banks say "erm, we don't think so" in the event of a bank run

Very true. I was just trying to see their response, since some people will say BTC has a wealth of uses, but as an asset used to make more fiat isn't a proper use.
But like you said, stuff happens whether you like it or not :)

Any links to how bitcoin actually has value? I'm not trolling, I'm trying to learn.
* If BTC is a store of wealth/value, where is this value derived from?
* If BTC is a (decentralised) currency, then how will it ever gain usage if even the biggest proponents of BTC just plan to 'HODL' until they are rich?
* How can BTC grow in value as a currency if everyone is holding it and not actually using it?

Why hasn't this been properly implemented in the last 9 years then?
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:27:53
I don't get this logic. BTC was meant as a decentralised currency. If everyone just holds on until they're rich or their holdings are now worthless then what drives the value of BTC?
Why would it be considered a store of wealth? Failing that, why would people want to use it as a currency if everyone else just holds onto it to try and drive the price up? Surely that would reduce liquidity.
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:56:36
Though you do get strange numbers thrown out occasionsally. Don't more people have access to phones than clean water? Or something along those lines 
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:04:23
Won't most of the people holding BTC now just look to cash out once it reaches a value they find enough? Leaving a load of HODLers/Believers in BTC and eventually a price drop, because only they see it as having value in exchange for goods/services?
FWIW I want to be proven wrong \^

But these days I see so many people saying BTC is no longer viable as a currency, only as a commodity that can be traded on an exchange etc.
Do you see it as a commodity now, which will eventually see better use as a currency once the price stabilises? As this is my view, I'm just trying to see a range of opinions and playing devil's advocate 
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:05:11

@_date: 2018-12-05 03:23:43
Thanks. I'm aware of the theory of money and how it comes about etc. I think I need to apply it more to crypto, as atm I can't link the abstract idea to the real world example, or at least figure out how crypto can go through the steps you mentioned.

Log scales are accepted as being better than linear scales in situations like on this graph. In fact, the price range of BTC is probably a perfect example of why you should use a log scale (instead of linear) in certain instances.
@_date: 2018-12-05 03:21:11
Thanks for completely swerving all of my questions, disregarding my first sentence and accusing me of exactly what I said I was not doing.
Do you really want me to explain why anything has value? Are you then going to talk about how currencies such as GBP are no longer directly linked to gold reserves, money is just a "promise to pay" and so on? Or perhaps I should talk about tulip mania, or is that type of story about economic systems not music to your ears in the current crypto climate?
In a world where the encumbent financial system has such a grasp on all aspects of life, I am trying to see if there are articles or sources out there which expand on why BTC and crypto in general can shake that up.
And FWIW, I'm 2/3 of the way through a degree in Economics &amp; Finance LOL
