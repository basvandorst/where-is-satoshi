How does that make any sense? What motive would someone have to pay someone else to throw dirt around about bitcoin's safety?

Not bad.

You could check out they may have some options for making money paid out in bitcoin
@_date: 2014-11-11 03:27:52
Uh, okay.
I don't see any explanation in what you suggested as being a plausible problem, but I promise that I will take it under advisement going forward.

To be honest silver and gold both have value in the manufacturing arena, whereas as far as I can understand, bitcoin is merely a stand-in for any other currency, without any true value or concept to back it up. 
I think it's a great concept and I love that it is essentially a "decentralized" currency, but I still have my doubts (especially in the long run)  about what this currency can accomplish. 
Let's say I'm Bill Gates, and I decide to buy ALL of the bitcoins, would anyone really want to buy them back from me?
I want to be clear that I support bitcoins, and digital currencies in general, but I still have to remain skeptical when it comes to my personal finances.

But how much is it worth?
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:57:27
400 bits @_date: 2014-11-12 23:38:41
These are the defaults, but you can create any that you want!

Okay! Thanks!

Why did you pay out if I lost?
800 bits @_date: 2015-03-19 02:22:26
RemindMe! 4 years
"Well, maybe not optimal, but as long as you hold BTC, eventually you won't be kicking yourself. At least that's what we are all hoping. But feel free to be mad at me in four years if you still regret buying in at $700."

I use bitcoins.
I would NEVER scan a random QR code on a sign post, but I would gladly take a dollar attached to a sign post, even though the QR code just may happen to be a bitcoin code for free BTC.....

Your example use case shows a glaring flaw....Why would I pay for content that I have no idea how good it is, or whether it's relevant to me?
In the example you give, how many pages long is the ebook? Is it illustrated or all text? Is it in English only? Is it worth 10 bits, or 100 bits, or 1000 bits? What if I'm not happy with the content I receive for my bits? Is there a dispute process?
I realize this may seem silly for what seems like "cents or less" but it really needs to be addressed, otherwise the market (read as "subreddit") will be flooded with these types of posts en masse, with virtually no way to determine which are worth paying for and which should be avoided....until someone (or many people really) have already paid for the content.

Looks like you ended up giving away a nap ($1.00 or 4159 bits) instead of the 8,000 I think you intended, lol.

You already list the charities I prefer! I'll just leave a comment instead

Because you don't know where the link goes to....
Could be a phishing website.

The average person without a "smartphone" may be at a disadvantage, but the tide is changing mightily these days with capabilities in foreign countries, as well as the "westernized" countries. 
There are currently alternatives, from what I understand, including some sort of text-based transfer payment, but bitcoin is definitely a viable alternative to emerging markets, as well as the average "western citizen" to utiltize BTC instead of moneygrams, money orders, etc.

I guess in the past, whenever I've scanned something with the qr code scanner, it's always just used whatever application was necessary to open it. html opened in a web browser, product codes opened in my shopping comparison app. 
I assumed this would work the same way.
