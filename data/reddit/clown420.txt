Thanks for the extensive reply mate I appreciate it, not going to lie alot of it went over my head! The other exchange I'm using is based in Australia (as am I) so I don't think there would be any issues getting the money into my account. I have used it in the past to cash out. Money was in my account overnight. However this was for smaller amounts. I have spoken to my bank about having large amounts of deposits into my account due to selling of bitcoins and they didn't have any issues with it. 
Again thanks for the write up mate, alot to consider.

Thanks for the last part.
Real dollars? In a sub dedicated to a cryptocurrency... typical.

There always seems to a huge gap between the two exchanges. But after typing in a few amounts into the selling form, it seems the only way it is really profitable is when you buy and sell a full coin otherwise with fees you a making essentially  $10 if you're buying only say $1000 worth on coinbase then transferring over. However there is about a $500 profit if you do it with a full coin. Another issue I see myself running into is my buy limit on coinbase, being $2000. So I guess the only way for me to buy a full coin is via localbitcoins however the prices on there are extremely high, which again would remove alot of the profit.. And I guess it's not worth the small profit you'd make in terms of the inital investment.

I wasn't under the assumption we were playing a game. I do not care about the lead reserve, I don't live in America so why would I use USD.
You want to hear my best half baked idea? Accidently buying 50 bitcoins back in 2015 instead of 5. Weed makes you do stupid shit.
