It'll recover. No worries. This "dip" brought us to yesterday's all-time high.

Don't believe those laws apply to crypto, though I could be wrong.

I've worked at a couple startups. Scaling 101 is "don't be cart before the horse". Rapid scaling is usually a total shitshow, but there are clear-cut ways to deal with this problem. Halting (or even throttling) new users (or even withdrawals) until the queue of existing issues has been tackled would be one idea that I've seen come up in this very conversation countless times.
Instead, what we get is never getting through to a CS Phone Rep, people posting on reddit, the PR guy coming in with some generic boilerplate, repeat. Meanwhile, they are *adding* coins to their exchange. Obviously it's a different team doing the implementation than those handling customer incidents, but as a whole, they should have prioritized this shit better as a company. Delay whatever feature addition until the backlog has been blown down a bit.

Yeah, I worked 1 to 11PM eastern... was laying in bed, then this. I'm amped up. No sleep tonight, boys.

So you've got 10 Ferraris now, right?
