Y’all lucky. It’s still in the $17,500 range at LUNO. We don’t have easy access to buy / sell BTC at the major exchanges. Hoping it would go lower when I get more funds in upcoming weeks.

Why are the dips always occur when I have no additional funds, and they'll spike up to ATH just before I receive the funds to purchase more? Someone somewhere must be playing this cruel joke on me.

Would there be any transaction fees if you transfer you BTC to the hardware wallet?

What herbal supplements, if I may ask? Just curious.

Haha, thanks for posting. I’m in the same boat. My only strategy is to average down when I have more funds. I believe in the technology long run and will buy more when there’s blood in the streets. 
Awareness on Bitcoin is generally increasing, which is a great thing.

I did feel bad when I bought at 7K~ish and it dropped to 5K~ish during last couple weekends. When I have more funds to buy more, the price has rebounded exceeding the 7K mark. Unfortunately, no one can time the market. It’s getting tougher to reach the psychological 1BTC mark. 
My strategy is to DCA, buy with funds I’m OK to lose, and hodl.

I thought the Lightning thing is supposed to fix all the current issues, no?

There’s always money in the banana stand.

USD is not the local currency. 
How does depositing check via app works? Don’t you have to submit the physical checks to the bank?

That’s like complaining they didn’t get a chance to buy AAPL when it was single digits.

I had similar experience trying to deposit a USD denominated check under my name to my own bank account. Bank told me it’ll take 30-45 days, else 5-7 working days clearing via wire transfer for just USD 100. I think I lost about 5-7% of the value due to high bank’s FX rate, verification fees, admin fees, stamp duty, etc. 
Bitcoin is the disruptive technology I’m hoping will empower users in financial services.

I think this is a solid approach but it depends on the audience and local regulations. As an example, deposits in Malaysia are insured by the Government up till MYR 250 K (USD 60K) and average individuals savings are well below that, so this argument wouldn’t have much traction. 
I’ve had some success emphasising having control of your own savings. Recently, I’ve had to transfer FX between my accounts through the “legit” system and it baffled me that it had to take 45 days for the cheque to be cleared. It could be done faster, i.e. 3-7 working days, but the bank was going to charge me additional ~USD 100 for wire transfer fees. 
In the end, I’ve lost about 5-6% of the transferred value due to high bank’s internal FX rates, verification fees, stamp duty fees, etc. and the whole process took more than a month. And there’s really nothing I can do about it. 
I mean, we now live in a digital world where we talk about cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics process automation, etc. It’s unfathomable that it took more than a month just to convert currencies of my savings and transfer it to a local bank. And I don’t have much control of my own savings and have to eat up whatever fees are pushed down my throat. 
I would have been OK if the value lost was entirely due to the workings of FX, i.e. supply &amp; demand, but not to a legacy faulty system. 
It didn’t happen to me yet, but if one day the government / banks decide to limit the amount if monies I could withdraw from my savings, there’s nothing I could do and I’d have no backup.

I think you’d need at least 2GB of RAM. There’s a list of minimum requirements on the Bitcoin Core site.

I see. I'll check again once it's done synced. Thanks!

Thanks for the link to setup. I've setup a full node myself. It's still synchronizing to the network and the port 8333 status is green. However, there's 0 inbound connections. Do you also experience this? 
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:56:35
Haha, dude. My target IS to get to 1BTC before it crosses 7K. I can't afford you. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:42:54
Would love to read the in-depth analysis.

Check out the link OP posted. The guide is quite self-explanatory. I just did it couple days ago. Two challenges I didn’t foresee were: 
1. Downloading the whole blockchain (~150GB) took about 2 days before the node starts running 
2. Understanding what port forwarding does and forward the port 8333 (this is more of a router and ISP issue)
Running a full node is no longer considered mining as the functionality was taken out. I was a bit disappointed when I learned it but supporting the network is a higher priority. Many articles out there say that mining is no longer practical for individuals - most mining activities are being done by professional miners a la data centres with ASICs. 
BTC Gurus - please correct me if I’m mistaken.
