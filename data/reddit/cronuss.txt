Oh, I am well aware. Just wasn't sure if there was anything particular going on in the news that I haven't seen.

...and this is why Bitcoin will never take off in it's current state.  The average person doesn't understand this stuff, and doesn't want to.

This is fucking bullshit. Basically being held ransom with our own money.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:22:28
This is unacceptable.

Can't sell anything. Just sitting here watching the price drop. Error when trying to sell on the app and the site.

Meanwhile, I've been trying to sell for an hour, and the price has dropped over $50... and I can't access my wallet.

Holy shit, that is a fucking amazing sandwich! But you hold it like an alien.

Ah, man, I didn't even think that it may have been a disability. I hope I didn't offend you, that was a stupid thing for me to say without thinking first.
I admire your sandwich holding skills!

Is this true? Nobody will find out anything until Monday?
@_date: 2014-06-27 15:11:54
Sucks that the winner won't be notified till Monday!
Typical government work... takes 3 days to read the highest number and and report it. :P

This is an example of what the human ego often does. These people are trashing bitcoin because deep down they know that others made money on it and they missed out. 
Its the same thing when someone goes on Americon Idol saying, "This is my dream! I've always wanted this! My whole life is this moment!" Then they are canned and they walk away saying, "I didn't want to be on this stupid show anyway. Its lame and I was just doing it for fun. Losers."

Also, you expected intelligent responses from the LoL community? Oy.

I'm a bit new to the bitcoin scene... can someone explain the ghash issue?

This thread is a perfect example of one of the primary roadblocks in the way for Bitcoin to go mainstream.

While I appreciate the message of warning, it is this fear-mongering that scares and confuses the common (or more importantly, the potential) adopter. People read stuff like this, and they back off, thus lowering the overall saturation and market share of Bitcoin.
