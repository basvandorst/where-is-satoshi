To those who never commuted in japan, I'm sure there are number of total aholes near the opposing door who need to read newspapers or their phones in luxury and refuse to move and use all power vested in them not to make room.
It's my hobby to squeeze to the other side and knock this guys off their feet. Best of all, I get to do it twice a day.
PS: Also it mostly get full like this in carriages next to exits, since Japanese people are too lazy to walk few meters to empty carriage.

It depends on the line. Meguro line which I use doesn't run very often and then it also splits into two lines.
Also there are few lines that are really bad. Just he aholes have to be cut down to size to make room for everyone. And most Japanese people are too polite to tell them off. I've made it my mission to make their lives hell.

Like others have said, it's not even proper Japanese. Lots of random katakana in wrong places mixed with hiragana which also doesn't make sense on top of random kanji.

From his tweets he looks like very level headed guy. And in my opinion level headed discussion instead of childish name calling works better with people like that.
He has his own priorities. Persuade them to see that a change in their priorities will benefit their business financially. Going emo on them doesn't help your arguments.

Once bitcoin runs on every android device and server it will have the same market penetration as Linux. It's still a baby.

Like others have said, use google Authenticator or duo mobile. They are interchangeable, but duo has few extra features that I like. For example push authentication, but it's only supported by few websites.
Don't use authy or SMS. They are not secure.
If you use bitmex, use Clef. It's very good, you don't have to remember passwords etc, and you can logout remotely from the app.
As others have said, make sure your phone is secure.
Also the most common attack vector is email. People have lots of personal information there. And once obtained most places can be broken into by social engineering. Your security is only as strong as your weakest link.
As such, secure all of your emails, strong passwords, 2FA etc...

It's interesting comparing Nigeria, Kenya, Colombia, Mexico and India. Everyone is talking about the later two and how they will make bitcoin huge. But that's not what the Graphs are saying. 
Kenya and Mexico are neck to neck in volume. Colombia is the sum of the previous 2 and India is around Sum of all the previous 3.
On the other hand Nigeria has around 2.5 times the volume of all the previous ones combined.
So much for all the people who say Nigeria doesn't matter.

This is how all open source software works. Devs most of the time will only work on the things they like and enjoy for free.

Have you looked at how other OSS projects work? Have you looked at Linux? Do you think it's centralised? Do you use one of the BSDs because it's centralised? Do you think people should try to overthrow the dictator Linus to make the process more centralised?
The only reason Linux got so far is because of the management structure imposed by Linus and his marry band of coders. All of the coders work for big evil corporates, yet the projects live on true meritocracy. Bitcoin is not different.
You should also remember that bitcoin is where linux was 20 years ago. Back then the only person who controlled what goes into the kernel was Linus. He gradually distributed the power.

It only works well if bitcoin isn't going up 18% per day! Wires usually take 3-5 business days and there's a weekend coming up. It's only good idea once the price becomes more stable.
Also the only places I can do it are xbtce.com and australia. 2nd option isn't the best price wise.

Well, what you think and market thinks isn't the same thing. Bitcoin is high risk investment. Better check graphs what that means, it always goes up and down. Sometimes it goes down a lot and it could go down even more.
What you did is gambling and gambling is stupid. You could have bought lottery with it instead.
If you were smart, you would put fraction of your savings in a high risk investment.
Like others have said, no easy money, otherwise everyone would do it.

Quoin is only one exchange. Another one is bitFlyer. I use both. The withdrawal fee is due to Japanese banking which is stuck in 1800s. They charge fees for everything.
There are two other exchanges, coincheck and zaif that I'm aware of, but I didn't use.
I have seperate bank account with another bank just to pay rent. And I pay fees on that bank account and transfers to it.
As for the people who think Japanese IT is advanced, you couldn't be more wrong. This country is IT backward, it's the land of fax machines, papers etc... people forward images in excel spreadsheets etc. usually all the IT solutions are done by incompetent vendors.

You didn't say what address, could be ip address, email address, the list goes on of things that are called addresses. Is it IPv4 or IPv6 address?
It's even more true for people who are new to technology and people don't explain things very well and instead they just assume that someone else knows it, since they do already.

Copay and the new reincarnation of it bitpay, allows you to select 4 levels of fees. I like it as a full featured wallet and it's fairly user friendly too.

Your post is pretty confusing. There's no such thing as US or Australian bitcoin wallets. There are only wallets.
My guess you have signed up with circlepay or something?
You can transfer to whoever you want, no limits or restrictions.
You can sell the bitcoin on an Australian exchange like  or  and get a spot rate. Then you can transfer the AUD to your bank account.
I think this is what you were after?

It's exchange like any other, I find the rates, and fees to be the best. But like with everything else check!

It depends what you eat for lunch there, I did eat some not so great food at that price. Beer is $1, I'm sure home cooked is a lot less than that. And I'm not guessing the prices, since I was there in May.
Also a place like Myanmar would be great for bitcoin, most people have smart phone now, some cheap Chinese android version. Use facebook, play online games, etc. power and internet is very unreliable, I'm not sure how it would effect bitcoin transactions. 
Very poor people who don't have electricity or running water use solar panels to charge them.

I disagree, I've joined bitcoin a month ago. Ripped some profit. An Aussie here living in japan. Bitcoin allowed me to move my money between both countries freely. Not to mention its stateless technology. There will be more adopters, especially in Mexico. Few of my friends who are traders have started dipping their toes into bitcoin to get a feel for it.
I have mostly started using it because of my hate for banks, PayPal, western union etc... I wish I've started using it few years ago when I moved to japan.

Yeap, exactly, from the comments it looks like the user is associated with the scam website. There has been other people mentioning on reddit that it's scam too. And most of all the USD to INR exchange rates don't even match. Why would it give higher USD rate anyway? It should be the other way around, it's obvious bait.

Why not use proper exchange? Here're few:
I'm sure I'm missing few...
If you want to buy bitcoin at best price, you would want to spread your buys across as many exchanges as possible.

PayPal is a scam. They don't care about sellers, so don't use them. And if they find out you are trading bitcoin, they will shut down your account.

BitPay does have a "memo" and I do enter who I sent the money too. I usually don't put how much, so it would be still good to have the historical value of the transaction.
Also another thing I'm missing is the ability to choose different fiat currencies for receiving and sending payments. I live in japan, so day to day I live using yen. But very often I need to send money to Australia and calculating exchange rate for AU$ becomes a pain. Same for other currencies like USD and Euro.

That would get me a lunch in Myanmar. All this talk about half of the world's population being unbanked and bitcoin being for them.
The people who talk about bitcoin being for unbanked should check minimum wages in 3rd world countries.
As an example, the average wage in Cuba is $20 per month, minimum is around $9.
At this rate bitcoin will only remain in hands of elite, hopefully LN will change that and lower the barrier of entry.

Exactly, these people would argue that Redhat, HP, IBM, Intel etc are bad for Linux. But without them Linux wouldn't be what it is today, and I have been making living of Linux for last 20 years.

I only trade bitcoins in Japan, I don't use them. There are ATM's and cafes. One place I frequent is Two dogs in Roppongi and they have an ATM, although I have never used it.
Also, Japan is cash society, a lot of smaller restaurants (which is most of the restaurants) are cash only. So make sure you have cash. Otherwise you might end up being stranded, since a lot of train ticket machines only will take the specific companies credit cards etc...

It means I could buy $5000 worth of BTC every month instead, with potential higher returns.
After paycheque I could pour most of my money straight into bitcoin. Usually reward programs offer you 1% in benefits and lets not forget the annual fees. Not to mention how much the shop has to pay.
I would think that when bitcoin gets more wide spread, the shops could offer high discounts. Also lets not forget Credit Cards have very low penetration in Japan. Most shops make tiny margins and CC eat into them. And if a small mum &amp; pop shop gets hit with a charge back it's a big issue here.
I will also mention, Japanese people don't like credit/debt. That's why they have a lot of savings, which is opposite of USA were most people are in debt.

Over the weekend bitFlyer mobile app added an option to sign up for a store and auto conversion of BTC to yen.
Also Japanese are very slow at adoption technology. Gimmicks yes, technology no. It's the land of fax machines after all.
Just to understand how slow japan is, you have to wait in a queue and get change for ¥10,000.m and not become old and grey.

After trying breadwallet and few others, I have settled on Copay. Mostly because of the stabborness of breadwallet developer trying to push what he think is best for the users, instead of listening to them.
Just today I was going to make comments on how to make Copay's user experience more intuitive to new users, but after using bidpay for few minutes now, it seems like the user experience is much much improved. Especially for none technical people. A lot of the advanced features are hidden away and out of the way, but still within reach of someone who needs them. Just not in newbies face by default.
Few things I have noticed, keep in mind, this is for iPhone and I didn't transfer any coin yet.
* One touch receive address copy.
* Obvious button to generate new receive addresses.
* Better QR code scanning (I had some issues before).
* Better user interface layout.
* Can disable all of the purchasing BTC purchasing options, which is good for people like me who don't live in USA.
* On startup, good newbie tutorial.
What is gone, or I'm blind:
* Can't specify amount of btc/fiat to receive, can do it in Copay.
Few things that breadwallet has and bidpay/Copay lacks:
* When app is in background, breadwallet gets blurred out, Copay/bidpay doesn't.
*  Breadwallet has very good widget for receiving and sending money. Really want it in bidpay/Copay.
From now, this is the wallet I will recommend to all bitcoin newbies.

You are right, I used them so far only for purchases. And they call it deposit cancellation. There's also coincheck ¥400 and kraken ¥300. But the liquidity they have is a lot lower. Not to mention they also charge other fees.

Who do you use for BTC to yen? As far as I know bitflyer has no fees for transfers and at the moment no fees for trading. But you will need to fully verify as a resident and register your bank account with them. All under the same name.
