I did not even prepare that link, you are paranoid.
All i did was delivering a link to a source anyone can check, how can that be trolling?
Why are you attacking me? Why does it upset you that this information is released here? Do you want to trick the BTC hodlers into hodling even if the reality tells a different story?
Seems to me you want to scam the poor people here, by denying them raw and true information.

You did not answer my question. Who are you talking to?

I expected to get banned here for releasing true information, as it has happened in the past. Am i not allowed to have expectations?

Of course any concern by the lead developers of the lightning network themselves should be taken seriously.
These are the guys who wrote the code, they know best about the state of the system.
She is telling us that Blockstream is pushing lies and is intentionally deploying software which is buggy.

Releasing a software as stable, while it is in a testing phase, is a lie!

What am i doing? Linking Twitter tweets from the developers of the lightning network to the channel where this information belongs...
You do not like to have real true information?

Why are you insulting me? Does that proof your point better?
