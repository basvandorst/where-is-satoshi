I would imagine that they would blitz negative narratives via media, invest in government to align to their narratives and create their own crypto currency with the narrative that their product is better than decentralized cryptocurrencies.

Sorry about this.  I like how you dealt with your self accountability in this situation.  Treasure this wisdom/experience in your journey.

Gemini is cautious with this.  It takes about four or five business days for it to be cleared.

Good read!  Perfect for someone like me who is clueless about futures market.  Thumb up!

Of course!  This - "It's not a currency we are using for a multibillion dollar business … it's something we are curious about, we are very very open to, but we haven't found a way to really integrate it into our business,...".   
The core of crypto is decentralization.

Maybe Gemini is dumping

An act of backlash by banks.  This is a sign of them feeling threatened by cryptocurrencies.  
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:00:23
I smell BS.  If this is true, Coinbase would drain non-linked accounts as well.  This issue only applies to debit and CC linked accounts. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:48:11
Do you have IRBapproval?
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:06:58
