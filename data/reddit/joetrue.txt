One note about 2FA - it should be painfully obvious when someone else has your 2nd factor (or you don't). Keeping a live backup of your factor means that someone can make off with it and use it without your knowledge. Weigh the convenience with the risk and choose a backup method that satisfies your own needs.

White: price, red/green: size of the orders at that price, grey: cumulative order count (i.e. the sum of the size of all orders from the center line...)

Meh, they're probably already technically banned. Jen would know.

When the feds force this kind of thing underground the people involved can become victims without any chance of justice from the government. DPR can't just ask the FBI to arrest the extorter so he has to resort to methods to protect himself.  FriendlyChemist was threatening DPR and his/her clients with bodily harm -- hiring a hit is self-defense.  All caused by the immoral actions of the government and FC.
Peace comes through decriminalization of EVERYTHING except force or fraud.
Hrmm, that may be a bit too radical.  Bring on the downvotes.

If a developer is willing to work solely for profit share then they aren't an experienced enough developer.  Experienced developers know not to work solely for profit share.
They probably learned this in high school.

When there're are no other options, because big government had taken them away from you, it is justified to make use of the services. Do you have any better ideas for fraud resolution that exist solely in the private sector?

-ish.  Yes, the code runs on the browser but there are many possible things that can occur to make it unsafe.  The obvious one is that the site can get hacked and new code uploaded that will happily send your new key to a third party.  Less obvious is malware that can look for browsers running this page and suck the data out.  Or someone buys bitaddress.com and fools you. Or a malicious Chrome plugin.  And so on.
More safe: Go to bitaddress.org and immediately disconnect your internet (probably unplug your router if you want to print).  Generate your key and print (or save to a thumbdrive).  Then reboot your computer.  Then burn it (last step optional but will prevent malware from holding your data around until it has an internet connection).

If you use a Brain Wallet do your homework.  It's VERY easy to do it wrong and lose all your coin.  Do a search in this Reddit.

Yes, 2 to the power of 128 (Electrum uses a 128bit random seed).   
Note that you can't change the spelling of the words because it uses those words to recover the 128 bit value.

Yesterday a lot of senators were traveling back from the weekend. Also possibly contributing to the difference is that this is a different committee.

You have to pay capital gains even if you don't turn it into USD; anytime you trade it for something of value.  Source: I read it on reddit (but no, really, it's true).

The Senate votes on more than just Bitcoin stuff.  Go check out one of the other C-SPAN channels, it'll be on there.  They are definitely NOT voting on this.

Not unusual.  This is a committee, so only a few Senators are allowed to sit up front.  Other committee members may be there but have deferred the questions to their chairman.  Even if they were there they may not pay full attention.  They'll all get the transcript and their aides will read it and write a summary.  Then they'll ignore that and the party whip will tell them how they should vote.

My (American) dad was a yacht broker and also managed yachts and crews.  This saying is legitimate.

Ridiculous sounding coming out of his mouth, but it's a valid thing. I believe Bitcoin is "elliptic-curve trapdoor cryptography" but give the man points for trying (EC is replacing prime numbers for trapdoors).
