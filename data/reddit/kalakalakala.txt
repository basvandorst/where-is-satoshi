I happen to like profit-driven views. It's all about the money!

No, according to some people here the business world would lose confidence in the concept of a chief executive instead of trying to figure out why the CEOs died and fixing the problem.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:46:48
Great point... I don't understand why you are getting downvoted :/
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:05:20
Bitcoin is a platform, email is a platform. Hence the comparison.
@_date: 2014-05-22 22:10:44
Ripple does seem like it would make a good replacement for SWIFT. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:14:11
Maybe it's a coordinated attack by three different parties?
@_date: 2014-05-11 05:34:31
It's also false. And OP is a troll who will say anything if it's anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-23 09:27:47


In what context would you seriously be confused by this?
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:57:47
I seriously doubt that! Do you trust USD less because a big percentage of it is used in criminal activities?
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:11:04
Bitcoin isn't the first virtual currency either, but it's the first decentralized one. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:09:54
This is ludicrous altcoin spam. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:52:08
It hasn't happened yet in Bitcoin's history, even during periods of really dramatic price crashes (like $32 to $5), and with a much smaller number of miners.
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:19:46
I didn't downvote this, but this post is a duplicate. There is already a story about it on the front page.
@_date: 2017-03-25 02:59:40
If they changed the inflation, what do you think Core nodes would do with those blocks? They would ignore them of course. The nodes have the power to determine the consensus rules, not the miners, so it is *you* who doesn't understand how this all works.
It is becoming clear the BU is about religious dogma (miners can change rules using hashrate praise Satoshi!) rather than facts.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:10:07
Haha, yeah for now. This is the thin edge of the wedge. Giving power to miners over any consensus rule is foolish. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:27:08
 &gt; What exactly is the difference compared to how bitcoin works? On the original blockchain a split can happen too right?
Yes if two chains using the same consensus rules disagree on the ordering of transactions then the chain with most work wins.
But if the two chains use different rules, then one chain gets validated by the economic majority (currently Core) as the correct one, while the other one is ignored. 
I notice that a lot of people are under the mistaken impression that majority hashrate can force a chain with new rules, which isn't true.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:12:42
you have the wrong impression if you believe that "thousands of decentralized miners" would control the block size. It is the pool operators who determine that. So basically a few rich Chinese men would control the block size. That is ludicrous and anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:15:32
Awesome, let's do this. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:04:21


That makes sense. I have noticed that the users seem rather young in their saltiness and naivety, like teenagers. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:54:02
The amount of concern trolling posts in today is too damn high!
@_date: 2015-08-17 01:27:06
Because he disagrees with the popular uneducated opinion?
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:59:55
The core dev haven't decided that "it doesn't matter". Seriously - if this is what the community believes, then we're truly screwed. All comments trying to correct this dangerous perception are getting downvoted into oblivion.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:58:06
You're not allowed to talk about that here. The mob has decided that a raising the value of a single parameter is the only consideration. Mike and Gavin cannot possibly be wrong.
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:23:36
If you include a few cents of a transaction fee, you will find that the confirmation process isn't/wasn't slowed down one bit.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:25:56
WTF? With friends like Coindesk, who needs enemies?
@_date: 2015-08-19 13:03:11
A "parasitical attachment" recommended by Mike Hearn, by the way.
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:25:03
How is that their fault? Try running a money service business without doing KYC and AML, and tell us how it went when you're behind bars.
@_date: 2016-10-03 19:53:27
Due to things like stake grinding and other exploitations of Proof of Stake's weaknesses, it's in essence a form of proof-of-work, just more obfuscated, less deterministic, and less secure. 
Although some people might choose to trade of some security for less energy spent, but a cryptocurrency really ought to avoid that.

Well... you don't connect to websites using raw IP packets, do you? You use a browser that connects using the HTTP protocol, which sits on top of TCP, which sits on top of IP. They all do their respective functions very well. The internet works because it scaled up in layers. 
Bitcoin is no different. It has a robust bottom layer that will resist centralization, and to do that blocks must remain lean so that the cost of running nodes is minimal. The next layer can then be used to provide high speed transaction services.
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:30:48


Yeah, that's BS. The price is moving based on the whims of traders and other market forces. The broader market doesn't care about the mouse turds that people are obsessing over in this echo chamber. Trust me on this.
@_date: 2016-10-25 22:04:08
It is working fine... just pay a decent fee. I just tried it myself.
@_date: 2016-10-24 03:04:49
"Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded."
@_date: 2016-10-29 08:39:30
It is a bunch of multisignature time-locked Bitcoin transactions that get routed around various nodes and eventually settle on the blockchain. It is a layer on top of Bitcoin. It isn't separate at all!
@_date: 2015-02-23 20:12:15
You don't understand the network effect. It doesn't care so much about innovation, it cares more about connectedness, that's where most of the value comes from.
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:31:19
Bitcoin has the dominant network effect, that's all that matters. Users will naturally gravitate towards Bitcoin at a faster rate than other coins due to its higher marginal utility. The total percentage of world adoption is irrelevant, it's the relative adoption that's important.
@_date: 2015-02-24 07:30:22
Yep. This is a cold splash of reality for the people who say that the Coinbase investors are investing in cryptocurrency, not Bitcoin specifically.
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:36:29
So what? The statement is coming from Brian Armstrong, not Charlie Lee. I think Brian Armstrong is secure enough in his vision that he can tolerate employees with differing viewpoints.
@_date: 2015-03-10 05:36:35
The 20MB update will come when it's necessary. We're barely holding above 1 transaction/s. There is still a lot of headroom at the current limit.
@_date: 2015-02-24 07:20:19
This is the key insight that some people don't seem to quite grok. The value is in the ledger, and the Bitcoin ledger's stakeholders are highly incentivized to accept whatever protocol changes are necessary to maintain its dominance.
@_date: 2015-10-04 19:10:58
apparently. How is this not off topic?
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:07:38
There's no rational human being who would issue a market sell order for their entire stash, thereby losing millions of dollars. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 15:03:01
Not sure I follow you... 10 BTC in, 9 BTC lent out, 1 BTC held in reserve. Isn't that 10%? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:08:17
That was just trading volume which was artificially inflated due to zero fees on the main Chinese exchanges. China didn't have nearly the same level of actual adoption (users, vendors, developers, investors, etc) as the US.
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:29:59
This should hang off of the top comment. Very informative.
