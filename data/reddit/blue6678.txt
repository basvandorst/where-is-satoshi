Yeah, I thought that, too, but it's only using about 20% of my CPU.  Is there any way to allow it to use more?
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:50:23
I added it and the status is the same. Between .1% and .3% increase. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:52:47
Thanks  - is there a better source?
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:12:00
A perfectly reasonable and sound suggestion. I’m stubborn though so I’m just going to see what happens. It appears to be downloading the blockchain now. 
Hopefully I don’t blow up the laptop. 
Thank you!

Yeah my total progress still only says 21%, but remaining blocks is only about 1/3 left.
I was surprised with so much of Bitcoin in the news, and the high price, that there were so few nodes (11,000ish).  I'm starting to understand now!
Ok, I'll just be patient and hopeful it'll pick up!  Maybe in three weeks it'll be 11,002 when ours finish!

Ah, I bet this one is much better.  Thanks!

Has this helped?

External SSD over USB 3.0
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:53:00
its running under activity monitor

That was excellent! I get Bitcoin but I’m not a programmer at all. All I missed was what a pull request was (but I looked it up). 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:54:38
I understand now. I don’t agree. But I understand. My agreement (or not) doesn’t really matter though, does it.

Major flaw? Or thank god people now have to use their brains to get something they want instead of sitting back and waiting for someone to hand it / explain it to them? There’s plenty of free info out there - I know, I’ve been watching it and learning it myself. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:07:23
Me too. Wondering how long they get stuck in customs? Ordered from France - I’m in the US. Last mention of delivery was Dec 19.

If I trade USD for Euros, and then the value of USD tanks, I take my Euro cash to the bank and trade in for way more USD than I started with. I was supposed to pay taxes on that increase?

Don’t you just love family?

What is that certificate and how do you get one? I googled but websites I saw seem sketchy? This would be a good New Years gift for some friends. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:25:12
Oh haha. Perfect, thanks!
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:28:50
Yes, they definitely realize the point. That’s why they’re working on it. They don’t want to get cut out obvi.

As long as it won’t take a week to revalidate it. I really want to get through Mastering Bitcoin because I want to learn so much, but so far all I’ve been able to do with the actual technology is stare at the progress bar for 3 days and it’s only half done. There will be a decision of should I stay current, or keep going learning whatever I have in front of me.  There’s only some many YouTube videos I can get through before just wanting to get my hands dirty. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:01:34
Yeah I know. It is. But I don’t have enough room on my actual computer. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:16:02
I’m in the process of downloading 0.15.1 and it’s taken 3+ days so far (50% complete). After this is finished, if I want to download 0.16, will it take a week again? Or will it build on the blockchain I already have?
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:43:57
Awesome. 
Haha, thanks. Well then I’ll  be on 15 forevahhhhhh
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:45:05
Totally makes a difference. They have a different selection in each country. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 05:46:39
Have you been there? All I found when I tried to find it was a real estate office. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:51:43
Oh that would be much better. I cannot suffer this again. I miss my computer. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:43:36
Thank you! I’m excited to learn more about this whole technology and play a part. 40 more download hours left!

I kind of feel like old people will be the only ones who can keep it safe.  I tricks, no computer hacks. Just pen and paper. The rest of us keep making it so convoluted and then screwing it up.
