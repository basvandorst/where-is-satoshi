I can believe a conspiracy. They work for the same company, BS. They want to take profits for themselves, not the miners. Just because they're nerds doesn't mean they're not evil nerds.

Segwit only got consensus from everybody because they agreed to the 2 MB upgrade for November as well. But later Core refused to upgrade to 2MB and created diversion in the communities about the upgrade and the cancelled the plans.

So instead of fixing the miner centralization problem (which is not an  actual issue if you [look at the graph]( of pools where no single pool has more than 22%), they went off and turned Bitcoin into a settlement layer with a patented sidechain system owned by BS? If they're really "anti-centralisation" why don't they believe in non-centralised development teams too? I.e. multiple independent development teams.

There's a lot of people doing it.

You must have been mad as hell when Intel introduced AESBOOST (AES-NI) on their chips and AMD took much longer.

Also [check this site]( which hashes the various whitepapers as served on various sites to check they're authentic. The real whitepaper is also stored in the blockchain.

Sounds like a lot but that may have been dumped on exchanges already for low prices. Also compared to the total coins currently issued and total coins that will ever be issued it's not a big deal.

Only problem is if the price of BTC drops completely then no PoW change will save BTC. No-one will want it if it's only $10. It'll be in place 200 by market cap.

Is it an altcoin if it follows the original whitepaper properly? Or is it actually BTC that is now an altcoin now that they soft-forked in Segwit?


How is that a viable strategy. A miner has maybe 1-20% of the global hash power. That means they'd only have 20% chance of recovering the fee. In other words an 80% chance of throwing the fee money away. And with $5-20 fees per transaction that's a lot of money to be throwing away on spam transactions.


What did you use to come to the conclusion of "massive inflation"? 16,677,937 BTC vs 16,800,375 BCH in circulation. 0.73% increase, not even 1%. Besides the BCH network just got upgraded to support the new difficulty adjustment algorithm so it won't happen again.
Try and use some real arguments next time.

A "store of value" with no use case, or degraded use case has little to no value. Let's use gold as an example as a store of value. If no-one wanted to buy/sell/create jewellery with it anymore and there were better and cheaper conducting materials for use in electronics and all other uses for it were no longer useful then the value of gold would depreciate significantly. Same thing with Bitcoin, if it's no longer useful as a payment mechanism anymore due to high fees, congestion, lower merchant support etc then it won't be a good store of value either. The money will flock to other payment methods which are useful and fast.

Check out the TV series 'Startup' which is based on a startup doing a cryptocurrency. Really good. It's kindof drama/thriller. Pretty much what you're wanting. Try the first 3 episodes, if not hooked by then you can reply here and tell me I'm a moron.

EDA was a necessary adjustment to prevent chain death when you have two major currencies competing for hash rate. It's much less of a departure from the whitepaper than Segwit. Why are we still talking about EDA anyway, it's gone now. Only the new DAA which keeps the block rate at 10 minutes despite swings in hash rate.
