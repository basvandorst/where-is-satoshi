This is the first time that I've seen this link (and I've been looking outside of reddit).  Thank you.

It's not that I don't understand what it is, it's that I'm wondering why the majority of the planet would want to make the jump from current system(s) to Bitcoin.  Assuming that the world will adapt to Bitcoin is, at a minimum, very presumptious.  If there are other people in my position, then there needs to something to encourage us to "adapt."  
Again, I like the idea but unless the majority of the world populace switches over to it, it's not going to work.

A lot of people focused on the transfer of funds (which I didn't really have a question on in the first place) in lieu of answering my main qeustion.  As a result, I was very short when I saw another post about transfers.  To be honest, I am not looking at names of posters, just the content.

Other than the transfer(s), why should people want to make a switch?
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:17:35
I think your answer has been the best so far - thank you!

As I've stated, I like the idea of universal funds.  I want to like Bitcoin but I'm not seeing a whole lot of knowledgeable information.  I get people that respond about transaction fees and decentralization like a puppet but that, apparently, don't really grasp Bitcoin any better than I do.
Thank you for the link, I will watch it now.

I'm sorry I don't think I understand what you're trying to explain.

If the fees are controlled by the sender, that opens up other doubts for me personally.  But, now I know more than I did. Thanks
I meant the merchants as well.  What is the number of merchants that accept this form of currency?  I got a count under 4,000 (and a google search didn't leave me with an "official feeling" of whom accepts).  To me, that is far from being accepted globaly.

For some reason, everyone is focusing on the transferability of Bitcoin.  Great, let's say I accept that argument as infallible.  If that's the only reason to go with Bitcoin, it's not strong enough argument for me.
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:29:04
I accept the inflation argument (although I did read something that makes it sound as if the limit can actually be increased later which is dodgy to me)
I don't know enough about programming to know if it's impossible to counterfeit but I will go on the assumption that that is true
Currently transaction fees are low but, is there anything that prohibits transaction fees increasing in the future (actual prohibition and not just because no one wants the fees to go up)
I've already accepted the decentralization argument but again, that, to me, isn't the best assurance of stability.
Easier to move than my money now - got it, check.
It's not actually accepted globally.  I see talk of some banks not recognizing it at all and I also have read that some governments are looking at possibly "banning" it.  The reasons behind this can be discussed but that's not the point of my original question.

I think we're beating the dead horse with the transfer argument
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:31:43
Sorry, I can't tell if this is directed at me or dskloet.  If it's at me, I'm honestly just trying to understand why I should make the leap to Bitcoin when I don't see any strong, reasoning, argument for it.  The only arguments for it are surface arguments with no strong foundation - hence my question on trying to get solid arguments for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:07:00
This is what I was coming to think of it but so many people claim it has great potential.  But, what I'm seeing is just what the end product is expected to be without any of the steps or reasons behind it.

So it's traceable in the from::to but anonymous because I can decide not to disclose how much I have?
Other than transfers, how will/is Bitcoin better alternative?
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:03:53
I appreciate people's willingness to respond.  Unfortunately, no one is actually really answering any question thus far.
What is the main purpose to Bitcoin?
Why is the anonymity a good thing?
Why did the creator want to remain anonymous?
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:13:58
It's not currently the standard so there needs to be some reason people make the switch.  Cheaper transfers/decentralization/inflation etc. are good but not if only a small percentage of people utilize Bitcoin.
Why does the creator want to be anonymous?  Why is Bitcoin different from stocks?  I see it as almost equivelant to stock at this point.
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:00:36
No central bank doesn't necessarily make me want to jump for joy but I can see the appeal.  I already noted the inflation (or rather the control of it).  What esle is there to make someone want to jump in to the Bitcoin world?  I am sincerely attempting to gain more information than I already have.
@_date: 2014-01-12 22:58:34
It seems like everyone is focusing on transfers.  I get that transfer is easier/cheaper/faster with Bitcoin.  What are the other reasons that Bitcoin should be used over current currency/monies?
