Similar experience, but they forced refunds to all of my (happy) customers to put me in the negative in the first place.

Exactly. I don't even have chrome installed, and don't have any plans of installing it. Even if I did, I would NEVER use a browser extension to manage my bitcoins. This is an amazing development, but I won't be using it until there's a standalone version.

I don't trust the browser itself. It sends every page you visit to google and takes screenshots of the pages you visit.

If you broadcast lots and lots of small transactions, it slows down the nodes processing transactions since they all have the same confirmation time.

They're gonna get 51%ed so hard.

But on the same token he's not allowed to dispute a virtual item. This is in Paypal's TOS. Mention this in your dispute and you should win.

Chromium != chrome

In short, it can't. It's not the javascript performing those actions as much as it is the machine code that's injected into memory through a vulnerability leveraged by the javascript. 
A buffer overflow allows an attacker to overwrite the location in memory that a program's function "returns" to. When overwritten with an adress that the attacker controls, they can effectively tell the computer "Go to this code and run it".

Its for search auto fill. There's a setting for it but I don't know where exactly

And he's hiding in a wormhole like "Lol".

it sends every page you visit to google, and screenshots your activity for the "recently visited" tab. These screenshots are saved in your chrome folder.

What happens if you clear your cache?
