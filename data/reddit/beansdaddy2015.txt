No you'd need to either hand over the paper wallet to someone or transfer online.   Paper is used for cold storage
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:57:36
If you are in the US Cashapp is good option
@_date: 2019-07-23 05:48:24
Never suggested a paper wallet.  U can download many wallet apps to send and receive with no issues or buy a hardware wallet

S9 can range in price plus whatever the PSU would cost.   Start by checking Bitmain and then other sites.   Plenty of them available but if a good price is found then review the site to make sure you aren’t scammed
Cryptocompare.com to review profitability depending on miner and hash rate

Keep in mind that in some instances you start moving $10k + in and out of a bank account and the government may freeze your accounts for audits.  Also after talking with an advisor at Chase, some banks have a zero tolerance for crypto buys and moves and can shit your account down with no notification. Make sure your bank is crypto friendly

Bitcoin isn't here to make fast money unless you have a gambling addiction then the money will be fast....fast losing and burning as fast as you transfer Fiat to BTC
BTC designed for those who want to HODL.   No one know the exact BTC price in 1,3,5,20 years from now.   However, my argument to u is if you bought .17 worth of BTC today and that was $2000 and in 10 years it was worth $50k, would you still question your investment?   I would also challenge get you to find a bank or stock investment that could get you a large 200% return as stated by your initial post.   Try and look outside the box for long-term not the short term.
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:04:43
In order to really see profit you’re going to need many of them and also low cost on electric.   Then you’ll have to wait til you get ROI on the equipment to really consider profit turning.    Basically if you don’t already have a large farm going it isn’t really going to pay off

If you look at some articles pertaining to btc and the trend of how it plays out over the years I would say if it continues those same trends then putting that in would definitely be a good way to a solid investment

If you posted this in BTC sub I'm guessing you looking to buy.   Depending on where you reside you'll be limited (you say teen so I will guess under 18) in your buying.   Don't invest into a site that promised crazy ass returns.  Find a way to buy some.coin set up a wallet and HODL.

Downside to keeping coins on an exchange is you don’t fully own the keys.   Typical saying is “not your keys not your coins”
Using it to buy regarding fess and ease of use is great but you do give up anonymity
@_date: 2019-06-20 12:06:32
If you have the 12 word back up to restore it should be there.  As others said, check your eth address and verify that the coins still there.   Something seems off
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:54:41
I'd recommend trying Bisq
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:26:55
Thanks for the clarity.  Couldn’t remember exactly how it all goes with coinbase anymore.
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:42:44
Depending on what kind of security.  Some go right to hardware wallets like a trezor or ledger and some will just basic paper wallets or something like exodus on desktop.   It all comes down to preference
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:22:50
Try bisq if u looking to sell direct.  Safe and easy

Thank you for the insight.  I just found the article pertaining to Mt Gox and know of all the issues it caused people years back!
@_date: 2019-04-08 04:44:06
I’ve used BitPay for years with no issues on my side.  Even have the bitpay visa debit.   Maybe it’s just an opinion as to which wallet is most recommended because from what I see everyone has one opinion to the next as what wallet is the grandest of them all.  
Simple advice (if you want to call it that) is do your own research and make the determination.   I also believe that depending on where you live will also have a huge impact on wallet.   For larger amounts I hold on a hardware wallet but for when I want to move crypto to fiat quickly I just move there
If anyone had other thoughts please share.  I’m always up for learning new things.  Thanks!
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:33:56
No worries it’s all good my friend
@_date: 2019-04-28 00:09:00
The options are out there.   Simply by googling “bitcoin loans” a world if opportunity pops up for what you are looking for, but I’d strongly proceed with caution.   Some may find a way to steal from you, whether it be personal information or something of collateral.  Best to earn up the money and buy the btc.   
Bottom line is if you have to “borrow” .25 btc you have question whether or not you’re financially stable to actually pay back the loaned amount and interest or penalties.   Just be careful
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:37:05
If you are looking to restore the offline wallet I came across this
@_date: 2019-04-29 23:00:48
If you have the paper wallet with the passphrase you should be ok. Here is a link and video that may help
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:15:07
I hope you don't keep your stash on an exchange type of wallet.   As you are finding out that's not good
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:23:59
Obviously if you keep quiet about what you do or buy direct from people vs signing up and putting info on exchanges which creates a paper trail you could hide it.  
Every country seems for the most part to have something in place that will tax or try to get a share of the earnings so you’ll want to check your country’s stance on where they are regarding crypto tax
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:18:30
I would never keep coins somewhere you can’t have control over the private keys
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:06:19

@_date: 2019-05-27 19:27:26
You could just send from wallet to another the coins you have
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:55:24
Taxes are still sketchy for now with the US. IF u don’t have on coinbase or anything like that just move to a wallet thats pretty trustworthy.    What you’ll run into is if you aren’t signed up with an exchange or a site where you can change over btc for cash, you’ll run into needing to do KYC (know your customer).   Lots of verification and other things that way
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:46:12

@_date: 2019-05-29 03:51:54
Can you send the TX id so we can look for you or have you at least looked to see that it was truly sent
@_date: 2019-05-01 04:33:55
These seems a lot like the bitpay card.  Has crypto on it and when you want to buy a meal or shop while out and about, you simple pull out your phone and convert btc to cash and use the visa debit card.  Been doing it for years
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:52:31
If u are a novice trader I’d say try coinbase and coinbase pro.   Yes coinbase has its issues and delays and rules but still seems to be more reliable than most
As for the “not your keys not your coin” thing, I’d say if you put coins there to do trading thrn do the trading and then when done move off to a hardware wallet
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:05:55
You’ll need to check the sats/byte requirement during the time of sending, there are several sites that check that.
Brd wallet on iOS seems to get high liking

I decided to pay the $10 to get a card separate.   I bought $1000 worth (around .3 btc) at $3300 sold at $7100+.  So if .3 btc was $1000 then I’ve made like a profit of like $1500.   To keep the numbers simple.
@_date: 2019-05-01 11:44:56

Unfortunately people are stuck in their ways.   If someone made their nut in traditional stocks they will swear by that til death.  If someone had a grandfather that used a certain brand of tool as a carpenter then they will seek out that brand.   Cars are no different; think ford vs Chevy.  Those who lived through the Great Depression kept their money in shoe boxes or hidden in coffee cans or through your the house.   I seen that first hand with my grandparents and cleaning the house out after they passed.  
Bottom line is humans are nervous for change.   They like the comfortable routine and tried and true.  Those that can get passed all that and step outside the box are the ones that get to be innovators.  I personally welcome the change and do what I can to educate even though I myself am learning daily

I believe you can check with paxful if they are a “verified vendor”.  I would stick to those

Once the attackers gained seemingly complete access to the Binance site,  it didn’t matter who had 2fa.   As stated by someone else, 2fa prevents access to the individual, but the exchange where everyone kept their coin is what was attacked.  Think of it like sites that can reset accounts if you lose access or passwords.   Just because you have 2fa, that doesn’t mean an admin to the site can’t access from the inside/back end
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:22:26
Hardware wallet for the most part is like a USB drive looking item.   But it is designed for cold storage or not connected to the internet storage of crypto.   It does come with a connector to make it so you can connect to a PC and then do transactions when needed but ultimately it is the safest way to make sure you are in full control of the coins you store there
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:55:07

Always a work around my friend.   Depends on where you are and it seems some banks are cool with crypto buying while others will lock down your account and cause hell “just because”
@_date: 2019-05-29 04:55:22
You’ll need a wallet that you can control everything from with addresses and keys
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:59:07
Is that all?  Well shit, hold my beer!
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:24:32
This is a standard scam.   They claim they can’t withdraw for countless reasons (not allowed in their country, Max withdraw limit, etc) and they try to lure people to deposit money with hopes of getting large reward only to steal it in the end
Another one is the “hey I’m an admin for a gambling site and I can make it so u win”.   
Rule is to check the site on something like Whois and see when created and what domains are used and all that.   Odds are it is brand new and that is a huge red flag.

It went through and is just sitting there on the wallet address u sent to.   
Try closing out the app and going back in.  Maybe needs to refresh but it did go through
@_date: 2019-05-31 04:37:18
Get your coins off the exchange and don’t hold there.   Not your keys not your coins...remember that phrase
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:17:55
I bought bitcoin at $3300 or so on the app a while back.   Then sold it for cash to be back on my Cashapp card so I guess I made money since the sale was at $7100
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:30:25
Gunbot was a good one I used but can be costly
@_date: 2019-05-24 01:40:59
To be able to buy and sell crypto on the sites mentioned here so far they are going to want KYC done.   Youlll have to prove who you are and some will require 18 and over
@_date: 2019-05-25 14:38:08
Cheapest place is going to be using something like Cashapp where u can tie a card and or bank info to it.   After that it’s buying direct from someone
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:21:35
Not your keys not your coin.   They won’t let u withdraw.  Only way to withdraw is in fiat
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:52:53
The student loans that were paid off and house bought with btc and a few other things that I no longer burden my family with would beg to differ.
@_date: 2019-05-10 04:09:19
“Newly mined” is no different then btc mines 3 years ago as in it is not worth anymore or less
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:58:00
I believe that she could hit with the gift tax appreciation.   Example you give her 1 bitcoin that you bought for $500.  Say you give it to her and it’s worth $10000.   Depending on Hong Kong laws she could be on the hook for the gift tax gain.   I’m in no means an accountant
@_date: 2019-05-18 13:29:00
I’ve seen this with bitpay before.  It happened to me and I panicked lol.  If you shit the app down and give it a few then restart it then it should be ok.   Worse case you send to bitpay customer service and they will help.   Found their customer service to be quite helpful over the years
@_date: 2019-05-29 04:01:33
Not sure u can post a pic (at least my dumbass can’t on mobile) but he should at least sent you a blockchain TX Id which would be a sequence of numbers like this
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:09:53
Not to mention the 1 karma on a nearly 1 year old account doesn’t help
@_date: 2019-05-18 14:12:43
You’re welcome.
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:08:10
I hope all read the lol at the end as I’m simply stating some of the dumb FUD that comes across the net
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:24:25
That’s nice.  The red makes it pop.
@_date: 2019-05-01 11:28:29
Don’t know if this helps but I found this
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:33:48
Should be able to send to another wallet.   Btc and Bch two different chains
@_date: 2019-05-09 12:03:17
See if this article helps at all
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:39:30
It’ll be ran similar to Robinhood
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:11:59
Oh the “only if” comes into play. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:56:27
They vary all over and with you being in Canada you’ll want to check on some for rates.   Coinbase pro, Gemini, Bittrex  might all be worthwhile
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:13:57
I’d avoid coinbase unless u jump to coinbase pro.   If you are looking for a wallet to keep the alts and bitcoin I’d buy a hardware wallet to keep it all and safe.   Don’t try and keep on an exchange or site for long otherwise u run the risk of losing or losing access
@_date: 2019-05-31 18:58:57
That’s why your fees are so high
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:35:15
It’s great to see these questions being asked as some people who want to get into crypto read and hear so much that it scares them to simply invest.   The ability of places like Reddit to enable people to obtain the knowledge necessary to successfully venture into the crypto space is awesome!
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:47:21
Yeah.  Keep on hardware wallet and then when need to trade or transfer open and use.  Your keys your coins
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:30:10
I’ll need to look into this as I wasn’t on here back then to witness this Russian guy.  But if he hit up thousands of users he is like a pre dated bitconnect scammer in his own way.
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:57:01
Another thing.   U mention your friends “blockchain wallet”.   If he/she is using the blockchain wallet app I would strongly advise NOT doing so.   Just remember not your keys not your coins.  
I’d recommend a hardware wallet for safe keeping plus you can keep multiple different crypto on there
@_date: 2019-05-05 23:28:09
Worse case is they do an audit and close your account after the fact.  I have seen that in the past with some exchsnges
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:49:11
Never just leave your coins on an exchange of any kind.   Not your keys not your coins
@_date: 2019-05-06 01:28:27
That’s where a hardware wallet would come into play.  Code to access could be a basic PIN number but ultimately you control the private keys
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:21:47
They may have it where they can’t withdraw from their exchange to another.   Also I see the site is less than 1 month old?   That tends to be sketchy in itself
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:19:58
Don’t do cloud mining.   You’ll never see the ROI
@_date: 2019-05-07 11:12:07
Apparently lol
@_date: 2019-05-22 03:41:41
Well “Smith BRIAN” in America and many other countries we call this a horrible attempt at trying to scam...oh and I highly doubt you are being “real” today.
@_date: 2019-05-31 19:14:47
I always use 200 sats which seems to be a good flow
@_date: 2019-05-25 13:36:14
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:04:56
Hardware wallet lets u control the keys to your coins.   On the blockchain app they control your private key and basically have custody of it.   Whether it’s the app on your smartphone or the actual website, it’s the same thing.   Not highly recommended.   Trust me.   One more thing, I’ve seen first hand where people have had their balances wiped out and no trace of a transaction even showing the withdraw.   That’s one of the issues that I didn’t have happen to me but watched it unfold for a close friend.
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:58:46
The fee paid seems quite low
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:25:33
Yes but their fees are high and their market price isn’t the greatest so u get screwed twice
@_date: 2019-05-14 03:23:13
When u send the btc and even though not confirmed the funds or that balance is locked.   You won’t be able to “double spend “.
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:02:04
I stopped using that long long ago just because of the issues like that and the “lovely” customer service
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:27:41
Some wallets will show the total TX charge by showing the amount sending and also show how much the TX fee is and some even take it a step further auto showing the per kB fee too so you don’t have to do math
@_date: 2019-05-08 14:59:59
OTC markets sometimes offer a good rate and other services more personalized compared to the average day trader.  Still OTC markets like Kraken still need verification and KYC steps done in order to achieve regulations being met.
@_date: 2019-05-31 16:22:56
Coinbase has higher fees yes and their market price seems a bit off
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:11:05
They are pretty tricky with how they seemingly bury the transfer out/withdraw option but it does exist.   And no you can’t deposit yet but it does seem like they are looking to add that feature
@_date: 2019-05-28 18:46:52
I’ve heard good and bad.   Ultimately keep an eye on your coins because dealing with any exchange you don’t have full access to your private keys
