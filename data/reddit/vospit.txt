That's a stupid thing to say. As he wrote, how can TA predict what humans will do? Explain me that
@_date: 2018-09-19 10:45:11
Who choses a Murciélago..
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:34:05
Please do explain how Bitcoin is not a bubble.
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:10:19
I have yes. I'm sorry what did I miss?
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:41:58
That's smart. So the dip ends if it's starts going up for sure again then? or how do you define the end of a dip
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:36:02
Do you think it'll go back up after this? I'm waiting to do my very first investment in btc :)
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:34:21
Like, it's random?
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:34:33
What's the low point of the dip that's the issue 
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:06:12
does this have anything to do with the current dip?
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:44:53
Sounds like a good plan! So maybe go for a 100$ if it hits 3300 today?
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:39:58
so now best wait until it's starting to go up again? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:34:05
you only need the wallet right? And then the ID of that wallet to transfer to?
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:08:26
Don't listen to these people that tell you not to do it. Programming is learning!
I wouldn't make a wallet for them, just store the amount sent/received in your database.. Have them enter their wallet details and once in a while send coins to the people that need it.. (short answer i'm riding my bike).
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:39:32
I'm looking into blockchain.info, is that like a cloud wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:08:52
I wouldn't buy a beer at 2$ and then see the next day that I payed 6$ for it because bitcoin tripled in price.. Right? Isn't that the reason people aren't doing transactions with it?
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:00:05
I do believe that! But is cryptocurrency going to stay as a whole? And what can also happen is that the top-dog is going to lag behind in terms of speed for example.. A newer coin could pass it by in a matter of weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:20:31
So they were affraid of the drop and they altogether placed quick orders?
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:53:36
How can you be so sure BTC will still be around in 3 years? Cryptocoins are so fast moving. Don't get me wrong, I also hope it will be around but I'm still affraid to spend lots of money on it.

@_date: 2017-11-03 18:53:13
also.. he looks high on amphetamines
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:04:25
The only thing I'm affraid of is that nobody is using it, people are buying and holding.. But it's not being picked up as fast as expected, right? I mean as a real means of paying.. Now it's just getting value because people are giving it value, isn't that a bubble bound to explode?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:26:11
What's a halving?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:08:48
How can you be so sure about 500k. That seems very optimistic
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:32:02
Well this one is registered since 2 days ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:30:19
so it's just free? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:59:12
Can you get the free S2X if you btc is just in a wallet on your pc?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:29:17
But so you get 5 sX2 for free? but your btc has to be on coinbase then?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:12:28
When the big bubble of soap it's floating in bursts into pieces.
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:16:30
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:40:18
Thanks for the great explanation! So what charts do daytraders look at then?
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:50:06
What about newer technologies like IOTA, I can imagine in the coming years a lot of "better" blockchain or other-chain applications will be released?
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:19:21
What do you mean with node? What do you want to do?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:24:49
I'm guessing you do.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:09:12
Exactly what I'm thinking! what do we do?
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:43:06
Back under 3500 or so? Like it's going right now I can't imagine it to ever fall as deep again..
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:33:40
what's the chance of a dip any time soon?
