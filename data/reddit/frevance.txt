This doesn't apply to currencies...

He's talking about multi-signature wallets/contracts.

Bitcoin is a lot, but nowhere close to being the most advanced technology...
@_date: 2019-07-05 15:16:09
It's a scam.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:28:45
Be aware that this is nothing but a gamble. There is a possibility that you will lose most, if not all of it. Please understand that, and if you don't feel comfortable with literally losing everything sell, even if at a small loss.
Again, be absolutely sure that you can afford losing everything. It's not just a saying, it might literally happen any day. If you see it as a gamble and are aware of all the consequences, the only advice I can give is not to get too emotional when dealing with such volatile assets and don't stress yoursel too much. 
Good luck :)
@_date: 2019-03-10 16:30:36
If it's too good to be true; it isn't. So yeah: you're a dumbass that's getting scammed.

Even the Fed knows we're steering to an inevitable crisis. You can't lower the interest rates forever, 0% interest will be the lowest you can go. They've created a huge bubble in basically every market by basically gifting people money and even buying stocks and bonds themselves. 
Everyone with economic understanding knows that the actions since the last crash will lead to an even bigger one, politicians and the fed are basically doing everything to stretch this party for as long as possible and hope that it will all go down the drain when they're not in the position to be blamed anymore. They're playing catch with a ticking time bomb, and it's only thing left to do for them.
The Fed's goal is economic growth, but such an aggressive, force growth will always lead to aggressive depressions, that's how the markets work. The fundamental goal of the fed, to aggressively force growth, is what's wrong with them.

Lol yeah 3% gain. Price on USD pairs is a lot lower than on that graph buddy. On the graph it's over 7000$ while it's actually around 6500
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:40:00
USDT is not USD. You can also buy BTC for like 5800EUR and sell it for 6500USD. Unfortunately you won't have gained anything in the process lol
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:42:29
What? There are several exchanges with USD/USDT pairs. Kraken and bittrex for example
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:41:25
Liquidations on Bitmex? Nah bitmex is smart enough to not rely on any USDT pairs for their algorithm.
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:22:53
No. It causes bitcoin to touch 7200USDT levels.
@_date: 2018-10-22 08:08:17
Being stable in relation to dollars defies the whole purpose of btc.
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:00:57
Yeah I mean he rather signed a transaction of grid. As long as the miners don't pick the transactions up (on the internet) there won't be any btc exchanged tho
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:36:21
Only because tether fud... look at USD pairs on coinbase and you'll see nothing out of the ordinary.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:58:04
Yeah and I'm saying this pump didn't have much affect on the bitmex mark price because they take their prices from USD pairs not USDT pairs.
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:20:21
Yeah but it is 96ct because of the possibility that it fails lol
@_date: 2018-10-22 06:13:02
You have no clue what you're talking about. Binance was "more expensive" because you got tether for it and no us dollars. If tether is 90ct US then obviously you get more tether for your bitcoin than dollars, because dollars is just worth more.
@_date: 2019-03-17 20:35:33
This is bullshit, my dude.
@_date: 2018-10-12 07:25:13
Please educate yourself about the system their price is calculated.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:51:20
3%? Yeah soooo unusual for bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-10-22 06:24:57
Wtf does zillion has to do with anything now? 
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:14:59
BS. This is what you actually predicted: 
@_date: 2019-06-20 11:32:19
What's the address?
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:04:14
Erm, no?
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:14:19
It's still no more than trust. You trust other countries to secure it since they hold it too and other countries trust the US with it. The fed could still mess it all up for everyone with the click of a button, so whatever the construct around it seems to be: the USD is solely secured and backed by trust and nothing else.
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:19:55
Well then lets all store our private keys in plain-text notepad documents! Because if someone steals them we deserve it
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:18:20
Yeah but you are not trusting a single entity with your wealth. There are several people, (e.g. fed chairman, president, big bank chairmans) who could singlehandedly screw up the dollar. With bitcoin no one person could effectively attack the network.
Trust will always be involved when dealing with currency. But with Bitcoin you are trusting maths and incentives while with fiat you are trusting people in suits that act behind closed doors and have been caught screwing up their people for decades.
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:59:51
I hope you're not planning to let that stay on coinbase. Please withdraw it to your own wallet ASAP if you're not planning to trade with it anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:36:48
Ok you're right, I didn't understand
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:11:55
You think 20m blocktime for 1 month wouldn't be worth hardforking? Especially since there is no guarantee that it wont happen again, or that blocktimes go even higher. Maybe even hours or days - who knows.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:42:36
If we lost 50% of the hashrate it would be a disaster. Blocktimes would double, tx/s would halve, difficulty adjustment would take a month. Loosing upwards of 50% of the miners would most likely lead to a hard fork in favor of more dynamic difficulties.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:33:16
What about 1 hours blocktimes? Or 1 block a day? Where's the line?
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:54:38
Contact every exchange, get every exchange to be ready, then there will be people being against the fork, who decides what exactly to change, it'll just create a whole other wave of distrust, etc etc
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:05:37
There is a big difference between fixing a bug and introducing a fundamental change to the whole network. Ever heard of ethereum classic? BCHABC? A rushed hardfork would be a disaster.
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:18:52
How much would you change the difficulty? What would be done to prevent this to happen again? Who decides what exactly to change? Will there be people against the change? It's pretty naive to think a change of this scale would be "flipping some switches"
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:15:18
Do... do you know what an ID is?
@_date: 2019-01-10 07:17:18
The market happened
@_date: 2019-01-14 08:22:42
Who cares if it's  "bcash tech" or not. BTC could use it just like bcash is using tech developed on BTC, it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:38:51
A hardfork isn't something you plan in a day or two. If every miner would only be able to mine at a huge loss only the ones trying to save bitcoin would keep mining. Depending on the amount of money they would be burning this might be a mere 20% or so of current hashrate. I can see 50m+ blocktimes if we have total capitulation in the market (talking 1000-2000$ here)
@_date: 2019-05-01 09:06:51
Bitcoin is not supposed to add anything to an economy in the sense as you presented it.
Does the USD actually create any economic value in the form as you presented? No.
In theory bitcoin can add to the economy though. For example by reducing financial risk (e.g. the risk of hyperinflation or banking issues) and in a lot of scenarios bitcoin can help cutting out middlemen (e.g. payment providers and other financial services using multisig and smart contracts). By making currently used services obsolete, those providers can shift their focus to other things ultimately making an economy more efficient.
This is all theoretical and under the premise bitcoin or another crypto some days gains mass adoption as an actual currency. If that happens one day though it will defenielty add to the economy by providing services via smart contracts and eliminating some financial risks.

@_date: 2019-05-02 05:06:29


That's just plain bs. 
Other than that I agree that Gold indeed has some intrinsic value. The price is a whole lot higher than the amount of intrinsic value it has. It surely isn't a store of value because of utility, so when talking about it as a store of value or investment it's utility or intrinsic value plays no real role.
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:50:12
So desperate that we are promoting Pump and Dumps now?
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:55:19
They also get a percentage in physical BTC (I think 17%).
@_date: 2018-12-20 08:43:52
Sometimes I see a post and I'm not sure whether it's r/bitcoin or r/buttcoin for a sec...
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:46:39
Most of the volume reported on coinmarketcap is fake.

I'm fairly sure this guy thinks Allianz is a guy...
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:52:16
There are no "physical bitcoins" it's just a souvenir and not really worth anything unless it's made of gold, which it probably is not. If it is it's only worth the scrap gold, no more.
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:26:54
I don't think this actually is controversial. Anyone with the slightest knowledge of bitcoin and the space knows this. CZ was just sitting on his high horse thinking he could actually control the blockchain if he wanted to, the miners wouldn't have followed suit though
