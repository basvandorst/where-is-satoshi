If the concern were sufficiently offset then we wouldn't be discussing it now.


For the reasons I wrote above, the fact that they have not been is not suspicious to me but rather the opposite.

The problem with your logic is that if it were a plot (by the CIA or anyone else), they could have acquired just as many Bitcoins as Satoshi now possesses (and probably more) without making it clear (as it is now) that all of those coins are controlled by the same entity (which Satoshi has never made any attempt to conceal). There was a time not too long ago in which almost every Bitcoin in existence was acquirable for a fraction of the CIA's yearly budget. 
They could have had their Satoshi persona "sell off" his coins to an apparent variety of independent individuals (who would actually all just be them), even running most of the earliest exchanges themselves, and entirely avoided the objection you raise, which they would naturally want to do in order to conceal their overarching plot (unless they're practicing some sort of double reverse psychology 4D chess which anticipates my objection to your objection and accommodates it, which I doubt). They also could have just made it look like multiple entities other than Satoshi were mining in the early days. 
Either way, if Bitcoin is some sort of operation to control an enormous portion of the supply of a popular currency via the Satoshi persona, then it's a quite sloppy one if suspicion is so easily cast upon it by any random redditor. This suggests that it's not, since nothing else about it is as sloppy.
