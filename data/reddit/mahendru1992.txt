Namecoin seems interesting. How come this isn't on CMC? 
Also I think in the near future there will be bitcoin, provided ln comes as soon as possible, but I think there will also be a subset of private blockchains that all companies will be having.

Aah got it. So basically more the no of independent nodes, more decentralised that particular coin is. 
So it's more of a saying lol then literally meaning it I guess.

Thanks for the reply man. This was the most clear and concise answer. So in the same way do you think Ethereum is centralised as well?

Wow, I never thought of it this way. It definitely makes a lot of sense. So if my understanding is correct, this is what BCH is trying to do. Increase the block size, which in turn would increase the no of transactions per size. This leads to huge storage issues, which would require humungous amount of data storage space which could only be provided by centralised servers owned by huge corporations etc etc? Am I correct with my understanding? 
Also, I have another follow up question? Say if the blocks size doesn't increase (as is the case with BTC), then the number of blocks would increase. Wouldn't this create the same storage problem? Instead of 1 x 8mb block size, we'd be having 8 x 1mb block size?

might be a good idea to move all your assets to crypto. You know...alimony. :D

Forgive my lack of technical knowledge, but what do you mean by "Its likely that such scaling on 1st layer would lead to heavily centralized system like VISA or Mastercard"? How does this lead to centralisation? 
Just trying to understand all this drama. Thoroughly confused

This is such a pretty good article. Clears up most of my doubts

What do you mean by losing out on Satoshi? Can you please explain?
