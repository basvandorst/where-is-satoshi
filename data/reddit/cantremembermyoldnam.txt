They're less questions than annoyances that can happen. If your counterparty force-closes the channel you have to re-open a new one which costs you fees. If you only have, say, two open channels and both these nodes are offline, you can't transact over LN. So you either choose a highly-available node (hub and spoke) or you open many channels, requiring you to lock up more funds. You can already see hubs forming on the testnet ln.

I don't care whom it affects though - it's still not spamming the network to send a lot of **paid transactions** (not that an overloaded network is good, I'm just arguing about the definition of "spam" in btc).
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:31:42
Yes, and I don't think that paid bitcoin transactions can be spam. Paid Mail can be spam because I didn't choose to receive it. Nobody forces anyone to run a full node.
Edit: Regardless of the intent behind the tx - maybe we just disagree?

I remember one of my first computers. It had a whopping 250MB hard drive and no internet connection at all. Today I can buy a 3TB disk for 70$ and can download a hundred MB quicker than I could 10 MB five years back. I don't think 300MB every ten minutes will be a problem in ten or twenty years, when it will become relevant. It took credit cards nearly 70 years to go from invention to household and Bitcoin is only 9 years old. It's fair to assume that it'll take a few more years before it's widely used. 4MB and even 8MB is absolutely doable right now.


It needs a malleability fix, not SegWit. SegWit conveniently includes a malleability fix, but it isn't actually required.
Your last three paragraphs don't make any sense since block size has nothing to do with the security of the network.


And yet the internet relays all traffic on the web. It's absolutely not like Bitcoin + LN.


It's literally in the first sentence of the white paper. Bitcoin is designed to be a payment network:


payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution
LN may be a payment network too, but Bitcoin was also originally designed as a payment network.

Miners would also lose out on more fees (i.e. the mempool they ignore) and spammers would constantly need to spam more costly transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:05:41
You connect to multiple nodes, checking the header chain, whether your transaction is in a block and whether the PoW done on the blocks is of appropriate difficulty. You only need to find one honest node to find out an attacker who actually needs to extend their chain faster than the honest node does. SPV is secure enough for the VAST majority of uses. Wait for a few blocks more if you absolutely want to be sure.

The words, although unlikely, may be for a "cold" wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:16:17
I have never bothered to calculate it myself, but does consolidating actually help? Say I have 100 inputs of .01btc each and then want to send .5btc to A. If I consolidate the 100 * .01btc and then send .5 I need 2 TX, one with 100 inputs and one with 1 input. If I never consolidate them, I just send one TX with ~50 inputs.
There has to be a point where it's, on average, cheaper to consolidate immediately than to just leave the inputs as they are.
Edit: I know that the idea is to consolidate in low fee times. If fees were to stay constant, wouldn't consolidating actually mean more fees? I guess you'd have to know your average transaction size, time, fee and so on to actually calculate the "crossover point".
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:32:35
I assume the buyer would set and pay for the fees.
Edit: At some point there will be a way to do it directly though. Technically it's possible - it's just not in the specifications as of now.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:01:05
Note how I didn't talk about reversing, but enabling and disabling features. A few terabytes is not going to happen overnight. Who are you to judge whether a transaction is useless or not? There's fees and miners for that. Sure, offchain is nice. If there are enough on-chain transactions to avoid a deadlock.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:21:48
One problem (depending on what you think of as a problem), is that it encourages a spoke-and-hub model. I'm not saying that there won't be multiple hubs and/or that a normal person can't run a LN node (it's easy to set up). Another problem is that you can't directly receive funds to a cold storage address (your seed needs to be in memory), so it's only good for smaller amounts. Channels can be force closed, nodes can be offline and so on. There are a few caveats to LN.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:11:48
Because if there was a point I couldn't find it. Is it that you get the big blocks delivered when running a full node? Well yes, that's what running a full node means. It's equivalent in post terms, I guess, would be to have a post box specifically asking for all mail so that you can keep track of it. But what is your point? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:55:14
It is arguably closer (in terms of vision) to the original bitcoin, as presented in the whitepaper, than bitcoin core is now.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:45:42
Raiden, flash channels, state channels, plasma, LN, variable block sizes, non-UTXO based systems, sidechains, non-blockchain based systems, sharding, PoS, merge mining and so on. Nothing at all.
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:02:47
It's not about how many transactions, but about their size. The transactions in the Bitcoin Cash case were huge. Bitcoin would have been able to store very few of them each block and it would have taken eight times as long for the mempool to empty once again.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:48:48


Wait, what?
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:16:35
I guess their software is extensive in both, size and scale. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:18:41
Do they do transaction batching on other cryptos? If not, how is it "deliberately, insidiously sabotaging" bitcoin to not implement opt-in features that would cost them developer time? I want them to do batching and use segwit as much as anyone else. But this is one of the side-effects of doing something as a soft-fork. It's just opt-in.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:50:38
What? Spammers lose money in TX fees, or lose out on potential fees (if miners only include their own, non-broadcast tx). Bigger blocks means that spammers need to spam more tx than they do now to fill up the mempool and raise the fees for everyone. With X times bigger blocks it would be X times more expensive to raise fees to the same level.
Edit: Also, it isn't "my spam"...
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:32:10
The last two points aren't really trustless. As of now there is no way to withdraw or refill a channel directly. This means that you'd need to trust another node to rebalance your channel.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:18:05
I feel like either you both think btc tx can actually be spam or I am missing the most obvious thing here. IMO it's quite simple. Bitcoin transactions simply cannot be spam. They are either economically viable to be put in a block or they are not. Intent behind the transactions does not matter the slightest and certainly doesn't define whether a TX is or isn't spam.
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:53:02
What do you mean? Btc transactions have nothing to do with mail or telephone calls. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:39:08
Bigger blocks also mean that spamming the chain would become more expensive, overall.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:25:43
I know, what I meant was that the seed on the ledger could have been used for day-to-day stuff while the written down seed was for actual crypto. Seeing that he "only" had around 1.5k in BTC on it and having it stored like that. There are some reasons I can think of why you'd want multiple different seeds: A wallet you carry around might use a different seed than your actual cold wallet. One could develop apps for the ledger and want to have a separate word-list for that.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:31:05


Why? If we can enable something we can also do simethink like
    if( block_number &gt; XXXX )
        previously_enabled_feature = disabled;
I'm not talking about a particular feature or how easy it would be to actually pull of a stunt like that. But the fact remains that if you enable something at a particular point in time then you can also probably disable it. If something were to absolutely not work out we can always go back. I'm not saying that we should, just that we could.


And what would that be?
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:36:55
It's not spam if it's paid.
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:59:21


No it is not. Already generated blocks can't be changed, but new ones absolutely can. If we can hardfork to enable a feature it's also possible to hardfork to disable it again.


Still needs the base layer to scale.


Sorry, but where did you get that garbage from? A really complex backend CAN be abstracted so that it's easy to use. But a really simple backend doesn't require that abstraction in the first place. I don't know what this has to do with the discussion anyways.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:49:16


Then don't run a node, nobody forces you to run it. You're welcome to use SPV to verify that your transactions got included in a block.


If I (or anyone else, remember the thing about censorship?) want(s) to have a track on the blockchain I (or they) will pay appropriate fees and publish whatever transaction I (or they) want. Then, if miners think the transaction is good enough, they include it in a block. What is it with people in this sub feeling that they know what constitutes a worthy transaction and what doesn't? Go fork off and only allow channel opening and closing and $1k+ transactions on your chain, if that's what you want.
All my personal transactions are exactly like any other bitcoin transaction. I want them on a distributed ledger so that it can be verified (by the public) that I made those transfers. I don't want to keep (some of) my funds (time)locked in multiple LN channels, monitor them and worry about my funds being stolen. I don't want to make purchases using (as of yet unavailable) off-chain transactions. You are welcome to do that when, at some point, it will be ready to run on mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:41:34
SegWit is not required. Transaction malleability needs to be fixed, but it can be done (arguably better) without SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:57:01
Yes, technically it wouldn't be a problem. It's just not yet in the specification.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:35:50


My point is the exact opposite. I am slowly beginning to feel like I am (in) the smaller camp, though :)


Or someone is storing a backup of important data. We simply don't know and it doesn't matter at all, since these TX follow all the rules, were paid for and deemed good enough for a miner to include them in a block they mined. Therefore they are perfectly fine IMO.


Right, but I'm back to a previous comment of mine. These have nothing to do with each other. I am arguing that btc transactions simply cannot be spam if they are paid for. There isn't such a thing as a spam attack. You either send valid transactions and pay enough for the block space or you don't. A valid transaction is a valid transaction. It does not depend on intent.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:06:20
I can agree to disagree :) I guess my main point is that it's supposed to be an uncensorable network and each transaction should be equal, so a TX can't be spam.


It'd probably be considered a dick move, but:
1) You paid for it
2) A miner decided that you paid enough to be worth the block space
3) Nobody wanted the block space more than you
I agree that the block limit and fees exist to indirectly order transactions by priority, to prevent the network from growing too quickly to be sustainable and to replace block rewards in a few decades. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:37:03
They don't "need" it, but it's certainly a nice addition. The block time is still 10 minutes so a confirmation will, on average, take 10 minutes. 
Imagine a base layer that, while doing basically the same thing as BTC, also scales so that opening and closing LN channels is cheap and fast. In addition you get all the benefits of LN. As an example, IOTA already has free and nearly nearly instant transactions and still has some sort of second layer. ETH will soon have the Raiden network. For some tasks (like streaming money) a second layer is more practical than waiting for on-chain confirmations.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:37:40
Please spare me the insults. I am not talking about s2x. I am talking about the years before that and their official stance. We have just barely activated SegWit half a year ago. 1.7x is not going to cut it by far though, even if 100% were using SegWit right now.
You may have no problem waiting for a proper solution. A lot of other people however depend on being able to transact with their fucking currency.
Okay, I'll spare you the crystal talk. But you yourself said "it'll take time" and I agree. Look at SegWit, know that LN is a completely different beast to implement and you can see why I'm speculating on a usable mainnet LN not before '19.
Sure, your fucking bitcoin is worth more than the fucking txfees. It's not about you alone though. Demount your high horse for once, please. The average transaction fee is now on a level where it would take a few MONTHS salary for more than HALF of the population to use their btc just ONCE.

Actually, if you take the data from your link, the one query that correlates most with it is Bitcoin: 
"table g" is the data taken from your link compared to the search trends using google correlate. I would say an r of 0.9778 is a pretty damn strong correlation.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:46:45
Sure, for tx between 0 and 0.13 btc for which the receiver needs to be online and where private keys are needed online for nodes. Not exactly the best solution. What if I only use cold storage? No LN for me. What if I'm only online for half an hour a day? LN will be impractical. What if I'm an exchange (generating lots of traffic)? Max channel funding amount is too small. So no use there.
Sure, it'll work for some use cases. But if I just want to send my buddy some btc to pay for the food, why would I do multiple on-chain tx? If I want to buy a coffee somewhere I visit it's going to be useless. It's not the cure for all problems this sub makes it out to be. Mich like bigger blocks won't solve every problem forever. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:12:28


That doesn't mean that it's not disastrous for those who do. Like those who run a business in the space that can't really batch transactions. Sure, it's not a big part of the overall population. But a big part of the bitcoin community is affected - some more, some less.


That's for speculators, of which I am not one.


That's my whole point - I don't think that now is the time to be patient. If - and that's a big if - the TX are sent by a bad actor then good. The attack will, at some point, stop naturally. If the growth is organic (which I believe to be the case) then now is absolutely not the time to be patient. Two years ago was the time to be patient. If you only use crypto as a speculation vehicle then of course you don't care.


I'm not sure whether we or alts will need the capacity by then. This current situation is a direct result (edit: I believe) of too little capacity. It's also at least a factor in the steady rise of alts and "decline" of bitcoin. Steam removed the Bitcoin payment method because of the fees. There are very real and direct effects. Come on, even the bitcoin sub recommends using different coins. That's not what I signed up for! You recommended ltc or eth. But then I don't see any reason for bitcoin to exist at all. It's not that much more secure than eth, it's slower, about a hundred times more expensive (lol), handles less transactions, has no clear scaling roadmap (LN at some point doesn't count), the community is split and unfriendly to newcomers, the "official" channels are heavily censored, parts of the core dev team has questionable ties to companies that benefit from btc being slow or breaking and both ltc (LN) and eth (Raiden) will get 2nd-layer solutions. Tell me again, why would I use btc over certain alts, except for the first mover advantage it still has?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:41:28
Segwit hasn't held up to the expectations and lightning isn't even in alpha stage and has been in development for YEARS. Blocks are consistently filled, and have been so in the last months. Fees are up a few thousand percent, alt coins are winning market share and, as I already said, a percentage can't even transact at all. How is this better than bigger blocks? They won't be the end-all-be-all solution that makes them out to be but it will bring fees to a manageable level until more permanent solutions arrive. It's not like a block size increase wouldn't help the lighting network.

Can you show us the tx ID? I'd like to know your black magic.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:18:01
The other person is giving you only one side of the argument. The other side is not arguing for giant blocks as presented, but for a moderate increase. They aren't against off-chain scaling either. They are primarily against SegWit which they argue could have been implemented a lot more efficient and elegant if a hard-fork (meaning a mandatory node upgrade) had been done.
The proponents for small block sizes argue that increased block sizes are bad for various reasons, among them:
1.  More disk space will be required on nodes
2.  Nodes need more processing power to process the increased tx count. It is important that regular consumer hardware is enough to run a node.
3.  Bigger blocks take more time to propagate through the network. This gives miners that are close to each other a bigger chance of finding subsequent blocks
4.  Bigger blocks take more time to download. This prevents users with poor internet connection from downloading and verifying the blockchain
The proponents for bigger blocks argue against these points:
1.  Hard disks are big and cheap enough to not be of concern. The current blockchain is at 150GB for 9 years, growing at about 1MB / 10min = 144mb / day so 1GB should be doable. 3TB of disk space (enough for 8 years at 8mb block size) would cost about 100$.
2. The processing power required for nodes is minimal and increasing it eight-fold doesn't matter. In fact, a Raspberry-Pi, a 20$ computer, can easily handle full 8mb blocks.
3. While true the impact would be measured in milliseconds, meaning there is no meaningful impact.
4. Again, network conditions have improved so much so that it is reasonable for anyone to be able to download 8mb every 10 minutes. Yemen, the country with the worst average internet speed worldwide, can do 2,55MB per minute. Five places up the avg. speed is double that.
Note that this isn't an exhaustive list of pro/cons, just some arguments that I have seen discussed over and over again.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:45:15
And literally everyone who actually wants to use BTC. Four comments in and noone has mentioned the hundreds of thousands of new users. In my extended family the number of bitcoin holders has increased tenfold in the last year. It's not difficult to imagine that transaction volume grows at least a little bit. Also, people were panicking and trying to get on exchanges. We saw that in August as well, to a lesser extent.
Sure, it could be a single person doing (perfectly valid, btw) transactions or a government that supposedly owns a fork or anyone else that wants it to fail. Or, just maybe, it's the fact that Bitcoin has been in the news all over the world and that hundreds of thousands of new users come aboard the network.
We could keep speculating, or we could actually pull the data. Just what I did. I took the mempool tx count, smashed it into google correlate and woah, big surprise - they [match PERFECTLY]( with an r of 0.98. That's quite the strong correlation. If you take more granular data you can even see the mempool lagging behind the google searches by a few days. It's not a perfect explanation. But it's at least one that actually uses data except for pure and utter speculation.

So one company not immediately activating an untested change to their backend means that it failed? Things like this take time. Which we, as evident in the constantly filled mempool, don't really have. It will be the same with LN. Block size increase will provide a remedy immediately and without anyone really needing to change anything. 


Like now? By not mining under a certain fee and by eventually packing them into a block. The difference with double the block size is that a spam attack would become twice as difficult to mount or would last half the time. 


Close to nothing, except for literally doubling or quadrupling the tx throughput of bitcoin. The fork doesn't have to be NOW and it doesn't have to be contentious, but we should absolutely talk about it now. We can fork in a few months when everything is properly tested.

The aluminum will likely melt in a house fire. Those typically burn at around 1000°C average temperature, but can get up to 2000°C in certain areas. So even the copper, depending on where it is stored, could reach its melting point of around 1100°C if you are unlucky. Go for stainless steel (~1500°C). If you are crazy get some tungsten (~3500°C) - you can barely melt it with an acetylene torch.

No, btc is objectively the worst for cheap and fast payments. Just because you left it out in your "comparison" doesn't mean that it doesn't suck. Re second table: Lots of coins hard fork quite often without any problems. It's all about schedule. Immuatable? I'd not base that on how many hard forks there are scheduled. I agree that bch has way less PoW done and, as a result, is more susceptible to a 51%. You are confusing S2X with bitcoin cash. S2X had one dev, bch has multiple dev teams and around 20 active devs. Are you absolutely sure that btc has $0 of marketing budget? Have you even read the sidebar?

You do realize that half of $20 is a weekly salary for more than half of the world? Not everyone uses BTC to just look at their sweet gains, it should be possible to actually transact with it. You know, like in literally every other crypto. Some of which process a bigger amount of TX with sub-dollar fees. About 5-10% of wallets simply CANNOT transact right now due to having too low a total balance. Bitcoin should be for everyone, not just for the rich.

It would take 2 hours to clear the transactions and then it would be able to process roughly eight times the current TX count of around four transactions per second. Right now. Not in a year and a half, not in half a year when SegWit gets adopted widely. Right now. Also, it's not a "small jump in scale" and why would there be any security implications? Changing the block size has been done on so many forks of the Bitcoin client without problem, it's not even funny anymore. As opposed to you, I think that Bitcoin should REMAIN functional as a currency. Otherwise, why would people use Bitcoin in favor of actually working alts? I have moved most of my btc to alts, because i actually need to pay for stuff with my currency. It wasn't made to be stored in a cold wallet in your basement so that you can watch its price rise.

If you had had $100 worth of BTC on Mt.Gox you wouldn't be saying this. It's absolutely ridiculous that you suggest that users store their bitcoin with someone else, no matter how little it is.

Bitcoin Cash would have died on arrival, according to this sub. Why would network spam go away if, according to this sub, the miners bag their own fees anyway? How will scaling "keep" improving? The discussion hasn't moved an inch since 2015. SegWit isn't being used and it would only give a tiny 1.7 times increase in capacity. The devs absolutely REFUSE to entertain the idea of changing the block size in the near future. Lightning Network won't be deployed on mainnet for months to come. Then, once it is deployed, expect a way slower adoption than SegWit. So yes, if you keep being patient for the next year and a half (at least) you may be able to move your coins for less than they are worth. Oh wait, you wont. LN requires two on-chain TX and has a host of other problems. I see people advocating for a "reasonable" fee of 5$ (not even that's possible with the current block sizes).
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:50:34
I know. In fact, I couldn't since I'd still need to open/close channels regularly. I just don't think there will be a lot less on-chain transactions for the reasons mentioned above. People are going on and on about exchanges producing so many transactions. Yet these won't be able to utilize LN. Lightning channels are difficult and time-intensive to create, use, destroy and monitor (yes, you need to monitor your channels).
I don't think a lot of btc transactions are reoccurring payments between two parties. Being able to only spend 0.13 btc per channel (when the average transaction is somewhere around 1.2 btc) will not help at all.

Some pools offer a transaction accelerator where you can pay in BCH to get the pool to include your TX in their next block.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:12:19


Yeah, no. I'm not buying it to hold anything for longer than a few hours max. I use(d...) it as actual p2p cash.


Oh I disagree very much. How do you think bitcoin cash came to be? Because people said "aww yisss, another year without a solution"?


I don't see it being bullshit. Sure bitcoin diamond and whatever exist. But they are nowhere near as popular as bitcoin cash. Look at you - "bcash idiots" and so on. Imo this is quite unfriendly and the "bcash idiots" were part of this community prior to August. So yes, the community is most definitely split. 


Merely talking about bigger blocks got an account of mine banned. Head over to - they have an extensive collection. The fact that comments are sorted by controversial by default, the dirty css tricks and so on. 


I very much believe that someone reflects the values of their employer at least a little bit. And yes, blockstream most definitely does benefit from 2nd layer solutions.


Sure, if the underlying network was able to handle the tx.


I misread in that case. Others on this sub however regularly recommended using these instead of btc to transact. 


I'd argue that ETH is better in that regard. It can be mined with gpu and has around three times the active node count. 


You mean the first mover advantage? How long before that changes?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:19:07
I don't think Ver has the status you think of in the bch community. It also has multiple implementations and developer teams. Node centralization would only occur if we outran internet speeds. Also, there are proposals for fraud proof SPV.
Satoshi mentioned that we'd need less altruism, more incentive for users to run nodes. If we were able to somehow provide that (maybe like Dash masternodes?) we could surely remove some non-mining nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:28:59
He could just keep the alt coin instead of btc. What is it with the btc store of value argument? It going up because of massive public interest doesn't mean that it has to keep doing that. ETH, for example, is known by more and more people. Why choose something you can't use? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:06:15
It's not faster, blocks still come at a 10-minute interval. The throughput is 8 times that of the core chain.

I'd be worried about it shattering if it fell. After a fire it might be difficult to get to it without using heavy equipment which could also damage it. Imagine a digger scraping it with the shovel. You'd probably at least lose some letters.

I didn't say segwit is untested. I said implementing changes in large corporate systems is difficult, takes time and needs a lot of testing. Core hasn't managed to expose their own stuff in the ui, six months after release. So why would coinbase rush implementing it?


Yes, and they need to double their spam with blocks twice as big. Chances are that another miner finds a block and bags the fees. Bam, more expensive to keep the mempool filled for any given time. 


By that logic segwit doesn't do anything against spam.
(Edit: And 1.7 tx capacity isn't going to cut it by a long shot)


I agree, there is no need to do it tomorrow. But even with LN Bitcoin won't be able to stand up to the demand. 


Again, for poor people bitcoin is already too expensive. That's a fact that I hate.
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:57:23
No, this is the worst it has ever been. There have been times where the mempool was full, but not to this extent. The discussion has lasted for years with no solution in sight. LN will alleviate some pressure in a year or so.
Edit: I forgot to add that improved SegWit adoption should also help a bit!
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:18:36
Yes, I agree. Sure, SegWit is released. But if everyone starts using it from now on it's ~1.7x the capacity. Yes, LN will probably be on mainnet at some point in the next year. But it has all the problems I listed above. Some are by design (the online thing) and not fixable.
But: The number of transactions has doubled this year alone and it's not showing any signs of slowing down. In fact, it's somewhat parabolic. SegWit isn't going to cut it by far. Other coins have no problem with doing double or triple the number of TX while maintaining an arguably even more decentralized nature than bitcoin is now.
Regarding the internet bandwith: [This]( is a somewhat interesting read. I'd like to quote one part about disk space:


Also, routing efficiency and speed has increased a lot (due to more nodes, cables and generally faster hardware) making bigger blocks even more interesting. I just don't get why we can't increase the block size.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:43:07
No, problem not solved at all. I can have coins in cold storage and I can want the BTC network to function like it was intended. I wasn't clear enough though. I can't get my coins INTO cold storage without using a hot wallet and multiple on-chain TX with LN. I can't receive payments directly to cold storage using LN which is quite the deal-breaker.
Maybe I want to collect payments for a month or two into cold storage and then break open that specific wallet to either exchange or use for payments. Not a thing I could do with LN.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:10:04


Beautiful argument. I originally removed "toxic community" in one of my other comments, but I see that I shouldn't have.


Yes there is. If you want the original bitcoin and disagree with small blocks, SegWit and/or 2nd layer solutions then bitcoin cash is for you. Otherwise - sure, choose litecoin or any other coin - I don't care.


You are talking about blockstream, aren't you? They actually admitted to having a whole team of paid shills. I can assure you that I'm not being paid for wanting to keep transacting on the bitcoin chain without paying 100s of dollars each time.


Sure, eth is only a btc copy and nothing else. DAG coins don't offer any hope of scalability. Literally the only way to scale a cryptocurrency is by adopting a second layer network. There is no other way.


I never claimed differently. I just completed the table because OP left out btc.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:46:54
Right, why the fuck would you? You'd probably use something established, cheap and fast. Like eth or ltc. Just not btc. Eth is just as, if not more, decentralized, has more developers, handles more tx for way less fees, can do a shitload of stuff that btc won't ever be able to, has a more technical community, has a real scaling roadmap (sharding, PoS, ...) and so on. I just found it funny that you compared ltc, apple pay and bitcoin cash but conveniently left out bitcoin, because it would look ridiculous. In the second table you conveniently left out all the other options that would make btc look stupid. Nitpicking and using wrong numbers won't convince anyone who does a little bit of thinking. Other coins do all the things that btc does, but better and more. 
Yes, btc once had much less traffic than it does now. It has also failed to scale pretty much at all for the last 9 years, even though the discussion has lasted for almost four years now. Even with LN I'd wager we need bigger blocks at some point in the near future.
Also, 30 pennies is way too high. Check the mempool - you'd probably get included in the next block without much of a fee. Say what you like but it objectively has eight times the throughput of btc.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:33:13
Forgive me, but this statement is pure ignorance. Bitcoin was designed as a peer to peer electronic CASH. Not a peer electronic value store that you can't transact with. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:30:44
It's been four months since SegWit activation and the core devs haven't managed to expose it in the UI. 18 months seems low to me tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:53:14
Then why do you discuss what it can and can't do, if you don't know how it works? Not trying to be an asshole, but these are things that are discussed literally anytime the LN is discussed in a more critical light than on this sub. Also, it's really not that complicated how it works, actually.
You need to open a channel with at least one party to be connected to the LN. This requires an on-chain transaction. (a multi-sig one which is bigger than normal TX so more expensive) The other party needs to be online at all times or that specific channel will become unavailable. They need to close the channel to get their funds. Yet again requiring an on-chain TX. You can't do LN -&gt; cold storage because you need a channel to be open. 
It's just not the end-all-problems solution that people here make it out to be. Sure, it's great if you have transactions that meet the requirements. But it also encourages hub centralization, discourages fixing the underlying protocol and doesn't work for a lot of the scenarios that people use bitcoin for (as laid out above). You don't have to be an expert on the topic to see that, just read up on it for a few hours!
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:12:00
You forgot the actual core client. no Segwit (in UI).
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:36:07
Not like bitcoin. A lot have dynamic block sizes, some have done away with the arbitrary size at all and some don't even use blocks. So no, not all of them would have this issue. At least not with current numbers.

No, it's just that some nodes have two weeks as the time they keep TX in the mempool. However, it can be rebroadcast (=the exact same transaction is made known in the network again) as often as necessary / someone wants.

I'm not OP but there are a few great resources in the sidebar. answers common questions you might have when buying and so on. [Here]( is a collection of links from newbie to developer level. Don't open it if you value your sleep. If you like books, I have heard Andreas Antonopoulos' books "The Internet Of Money" (why Bitcoin?) and "Mastering Bitcoin" (how to Bitcoin) recommended a lot. I haven't read them though.
Is there anything more specific you are looking for, information-wise? I have a few links saved.
Regarding the SegWit wallet: It will save you on fees and allow Bitcoin to scale better, the more people use it. If you only have like 10$ on the wallet you won't be able to transfer it at the moment, due to the overfilled transaction queue (=mempool) driving up fees beyond what you have. If you regularly use the wallet to receive/send, I would definitely recommend biting the bullet and at least generating a second, SegWit enabled one and use that from now on. At some point in the future (could be days or months) transaction fees will go down and you can transfer the rest of your funds.
There is no hard requirement for you to stop using legacy addresses. You will always be able to access your funds if you have the key. It's just cheaper for you and better for Bitcoin in general to use SegWit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:31:25
Holy moly, I misunderstood the way commitment transactions work - thank you for making me read again! Hehe yeah, I understand the difference between hot and cold wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:26:47
You are absolutely right and I think I misspoke. What I wanted to express is that there isn't a law that says "send 1 monero (or any other crypto) tx and pay 1/100 monero". Rather, the 1/100monero is determined by factors like TX size and throughput. Increase throughput -&gt; decrease required fee. I can store 290 bytes of "data" on the eth chain for about 50 cents. I can store 290 bytes of "data" on the btc chain for 100 times that. Idk about monero.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:03:49
I added bitcoin to your table.


It is objectively not the worst solution for cheap and fast payments (my first table). Neither can bitcoin if it doesn't work for payments at all.


Do you mean this?


These are all very relevant features. You compared btc and bch centralization, dev count, tx throughput and fees. I compared those to eth and added a few points that I think are relevant to cryptos in general as well. No cherry picking at all. I think btc has a lot of problems that have already been solved (elegantly) by some alts. I don't think bch is perfect either. All I'm pointing out is that there are alternatives that you didn't really take into account with your comparison, thereby rendering it quite useless.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:10:28

I really don't understand the fascination with Satoshi. For all we know he may have been dead for years. Why speculate on what he "would do"? It feels a bit like "What would Jesus do?", as if Satoshi would always have the perfect answer for any question.
Sure, he had the original idea for bitcoin. But that doesn't mean that he planned for, or even thought of, every problem we have to deal with now.
Maybe he would go "oh fuck this, bitcoin sucks and is used only by criminals", maybe he would support the hard fork or maybe he would think that SW and LN are great ideas. We simply don't know and it's exceedingly useless to have endless discussions about whether he would have supported something or not.
I however agree that it's an interesting thought and that people must be making up their own minds.

Wait what? The blockchain belongs to the public and the name "Bitcoin" belongs to the chain with the most accumulated PoW, as defined. There are private(ly owned) blockchains, but the Bitcoin one simply isn't.




Make up your mind! You don't get to nitpick what parts other devs use with FOSS. Sure, if your database is private that's another thing. But to say that a public blockchain must not be used by any other project than the original is... a stretch.

@_date: 2017-11-20 12:32:18

The current algorithm is broken and the community knows it. I think the original difficulty adjustment algo was necessary though to get the chain going. It should have been tested and there were a lot of concerned voices if I remember correctly.
To fix the current situation they will do a hardfork tomorrow. I don't exactly know how the new algorithm works but it's supposed to produce very stable 10 minute block times even with wildly varying hash rate.

You can use addresses as often as you want. It's not a good idea though, for various reasons: 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:18:08
Oh come on, even a normal computer of today can handle a node with Gigabyte sized blocks and we're not going to need these any time soon. Even with LN we'll need more on-chain capacity for users to lock their money in hubs.
And you honestly think that the govt can't cut you off from the network in any other way? How would they even enforce such a ban? "Dear Miners worldwide, address X can't spend" or "Dear Node operators worldwide, Blocks with address X in them are invalid" or "Dear Node operators all over the world, this specific IP can't connect!" There are easier ways to do that than to call up node operators all over the world.
I argue that nodes will always be run by hobbyists and those who actually need them and that it will literally never cost $10k to run a node (how do you even get to such a number?), regardless of what the block size is.
The argument that continuously slightly increasing the block size will also increase centralization (a stupid measure anyways, it's not quantifiable) has been proven wrong time and time again. It's literally Blockstream's stated principle to sell LN with patents in them, opening Bitcoin to a massive array of legal problems. Why is this not a problem, but a maybe slightly decreased node count is the immediate death of all that Bitcoin stands for? I just don't get why you would want to hold back the currency we chose so badly.

I run four different 24/7 nodes on one of my computers and it costs nothing really. You can get a 3TB HDD for around 50-60$. Also, it was not intended for each and every user to run a node. Rather SPV wallets should be used by those who only need to transact.
Edge cases where money could be lost. The one implementation that claims to be closest to working received safety related bug reports in the last month. The other two claim to be early alpha stage and I tend to believe the programmers more than you. I don't want this on the mainnet and it won't be in the next months. Also, look at how long it took wallets to implement SegWit.
Again, block size increase would provide immediate relief. I also want the lightning network but it's just not ready and, my guess, won't be until sometimes mid next year.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:15:01
Sorry to disappoint you, but 2mb blocks are not going to happen now, ever. Just imagine core going "remember that 2mb increase we fought so hard that we were ready to hard-fork to another PoW? Yeah, we just decided to do that now!"
We already have SegWit that's said to support blocks up to 1.7MB, so we do not need bigger blocks in their eyes. Furthermore, bigger blocks are only "a bandaid" which automatically disqualifies them from being implemented. It's not going to ever happen. Instead we will wait for more than a year for LN to become ready, losing a few % of market share each month.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:19:43
No offense taken, I was just joking. A signed message would do, I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:10:13
A month or two? The single current implementation still gets new critical bug reports where coins could be lost. No way that this thing is ready in two months. A block size increase, however, would help immediately, is already tested in various different coins and simulations and is confirmed to work just fine.
@_date: 2019-12-12 07:12:55
There are a few basic ways in which you can connect to the bitcoin network. One is using a full node. This is a program that connects to other bitcoin users around the world and sends your transactions to them. But more importantly, it also receives every new block of transactions that gets mined and validates it. This way, as long as you have access to the internet, you have access to the bitcoin network and can use it. You also have the full chain of blocks and can validate that every single transaction in there is valid. Due to how hashes work, this is quite easy to do, even if it sounds like a lot. This is what the other commenter means when they say "actually using bitcoin". 
Then there are so-called spv wallets. Those connect to a remote server which runs the node for you. They require less bandwidth, are quicker to use and don't require as much technical knowledge to use. To know how many btc you have, your spv wallet asks the remote server. That server could refuse to answer for a number of reasons. It could be down, you could be blocked off and so on. Then you wouldn't know how many btc are on your wallet and you also wouldn't be able to send new transactions. The advantage, of course, is that you can use these wallets instantly and with very bad internet connection. This is what they meant by "not using bitcoin".
It's as much a technical argument as it is an ideological one. Initially using a full node was the only way of using btc since spv wallets simply didn't exist beyond a description of them from the white paper. The way it was intended was: Full nodes for miners, because they need to know about each and every transactions and they'll keep each other in check. Spv wallets for users who don't need (or can't download, for some reason) all the other stuff. This is basically what's being argued about. Who needs a node/who doesn't. Let me know if you have any more questions, I enjoy writing these as much as I hope people enjoy reading.

My post comment was more about hardware wallets in general than about ledger. It's safer to use one than not to use one and it doesn't cost the world. So I see no reason not to.
Sure, you can use a full node, but it doesn't contribute to your coins being safer in any way. One could still spin up a node easily, if absolutely required for some reason.
@_date: 2019-12-11 18:34:27
Compared to a full node, hardware wallets are easy to use and incredibly safe. Assume that you're somewhat new to cryptos (as is 90% of the population), don't use computers that regularly and then compare the two to see why a hardware wallet is so much better:
Ledger: Open the URL that's written in the factory-sealed packaging, download the program and install it. Plug in the ledger, follow the instructions and write down your seed (on the supplied paper) and off you go. All done in 30 minutes if you don't use a computer regularly and there is no way that your key will leak if you can follow basic instructions. Your key never gets copied to the memory of your PC and stays inaccessible to it. Basically no worries about someone stealing your key before you've even used them.
Then, to use it, you just plug it in, enter your pin and don't need to worry about anything. Did you download a malware version of the ledger software? No problem, money's safe. Someone is capturing your screen or keyboard input? Your money is safe. Someone *has remote access to your computer*? You would be **perfectly safe**, as long as you read the ledger screen before pressing confirm on transactions. Did someone slip you a modified firmware which disables these features? Nah, the firmware must be signed, otherwise it won't install. Do you need to store something other than Bitcoin? Ledger (and of course other hardware wallets as well) have got you covered with literally hundreds of assets you can store on them. Each being equally safe from being stolen.
Compare that to a full node experience: First of all, where would I go to download it? Search on google? bitcoin com/org/it? That's the first problem. But say I found the right node and installed it. I'd have to confirm my download using the checksum. A layperson won't want/know how to do that. Then, before I can do anything useful (send/see my money), I'll have to download the entire blockchain which will take multiple hours and use up more storage space than I want to give it. Then what? Generate a key and be perfectly sure that nobody is screen capturing or reading my keystrokes? I'm sure a layperson will think of using an always-air-gapped PC or analog means to generate their keys.
To make it "safe", I can encrypt the key. With a passphrase I'd *enter on that same PC*. Or I can just enter the key each time I'd want to access my money. On that same PC. It's ridiculous and just a tad more safe than just storing the key in plain text. There is no way to actually physically confirm transactions on an immutable device (that's not the probably-malware-infested PC the node is running on) before they are being sent out.
Say I accidentally download and install an infected version of the node. It could do *anything* with my money as soon as I decrypt the key by entering the passphrase. It could change the amount being sent and change the recipient addresses of my transactions. Or it could just send transactions on it's own.
You're just one small mistake away from losing money to some script kiddie. It has happened to a friend of mine (luckily only for a very small amount), it has happened to a lot of other people and it can happen to you as well. Please just get a freaking hardware wallet, it's not that expensive.
TL;DR: Hardware wallets are easy to use and the money incredibly safe. Nodes are not easy and the money is not nearly as safe.

Oh come on, there would have been better solutions than SegWit, like Flextrans. SegWit is active and I'm using it every day though, so I don't see what's your problem there. I just think that the same (maybe even a better) result could have been achieved with a more elegant solution.


I absolutely agree. I just don't really think that a completely full 100% is possible. There's always going to be the select few who don't want changes.


I would word it slightly differently: Critical issues must be fixed - of course I agree on that part. But if the fix changes anything about the consensus rules it's automatically a hard-fork and thus requires overwhelming consensus.


I don't think so.
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:54:20
Bitcoin also hard-forked once to remove a few trillion coins from existence. By your argument it is also worthless.

You keep changing your position. "The consensus that bugs are to be fixed is reached before any user starts to use any software." What does that even mean?

@_date: 2018-03-01 12:54:14
I fully agree with all your points, except for this one:


This shouldn't have been possible, if it even happened, which I don't believe. A combination of a massive amount of new wallets being used, exchange activity, the block size and wallet fee estimation are absolutely enough to explain why the chain was at its limit. Just look at the recent Binance activity. They paid around 100sat/byte on every single TX, even though the chain was nearly empty when they did so. Coinbase also overpaid fees. Combine that with low priority transactions stuck for months, a lot more activity and wallets that try to get their transactions in the next few blocks and you have a runaway situation.

@_date: 2017-09-29 21:49:13
Excuse me for not gathering that from your "why couldn't it survive?". Why ask and waste peoples time explaining it when you already know? It probably won't survive because most of the economic value will use the other chain. I mean, most exchanges, wallet devs and over 90% of miners said that they want 2x. I agree with them and I'm certainly no shill. Everyone I talk to agrees and they aren't shills. r/bitcoin is a echo-chamber when it comes to 2x. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:45:22


This was your initial statement. Then, bugs appear in your argument:


Then you start arguing that fixes for bugs automatically have consensus:




What and who defines good? It's what we need to find consensus about.


This is absolute hogwash, sorry. Think about that statement for just one second. What about transaction malleability? That was a bug and I agree that it needed to be solved. But I didn't agree to SegWit, which, IMO, is a somewhat ugly solution. By your definition I am now a hostile actor and not a real user anymore (lol, how do you even define that?) and trying to stop Bitcoin.
What about the timewarp bug? It has been in the Bitcoin code since forever and causes unintended things that are definitely not good (wrong difficulty target). Yet it doesn't get fixed, because it would be a consensus rule update that's difficult to achieve. How about that?
Again, and for the last time, because I am getting bored of repeating myself: You are VERY unlikely to find 100% consensus (as in: everyone who has a voice - i.e. runs a node / is mining - agrees) on anything, even for fixing certain bugs. Sure, you can say that those who disagree with you are bad actors and shouldn't have a voice but that isn't how Bitcoin works. You can also say that you personally expect me to agree to (as of yet unknown) future changes, but again, that's not how it works.
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:20:47


That's doing nothing really. I could easily and cheaply spawn a few hundred nodes using some cloud like the Amazon one. Mining on the other hand actually secures the network.


That's a good point. I still think it would have kept more of the pie if it wasn't held back.


I think this is where we fundamentally disagree. Do you want 1MB (or close to 2MB with SegWit) blocks forever?
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:07:01
The easiest thing to do (and to circumvent) is to simply block the port. The protocol uses unencrypted connections over TCP so they can also easily be blocked.

Are you trying to convey something here or is it that you just want to insult? Changing a variable that was not supposed to stay at its value forever is, in my eyes, a lesser change than building a completely new layer on top of the already existing and telling people that from now on it will basically be the only way to transact because on-chain is going to be too expensive. I'm not sure if that's what people had in mind when they made bitcoin and it's for sure not what I wanted when I got mine. But hey, come November we'll see who "wins" - because in the current situation, no matter your opinion, everyone holding just bitcoin loses out to alts.

@_date: 2017-09-29 13:08:16
Because of the difficulty. With 10% of hash power remaining it would take 10 times as long for blocks to arrive. In the worst case (for the legacy chain) the fork would occur right after a difficulty adjustment. This means that there would be 20 weeks of 1mb blocks 1:40h apart. After that the difficulty would adjust down by 75% (the maximum) and the chain would be left with 25 minute block times for the next month after which the difficulty would adjust back to normal. This reduces the already low throughput by 90% and skyrockets fees even more. This is all the while the other chain has on average 11 minute confirmation times, much lower fees and a smaller backlog, meaning even faster confirmation times. You'd have to wait 10 hours for six confirmations on the legacy chain while the 2x chain would do just that in about an hour.
It would basically be useless for the better part of half a year while the rest of the ecosystem (big exchanges, wallets etc. all support 2x) continues to function normally (and cheaper than before).
@_date: 2017-09-29 11:53:35


Sure, that's going to be WAY easier than using your wallet to just send a regular bitcoin transaction directly. I don't want to sound condescending, but do you honestly think that regular people are going to be able to do this? Most of the people (even techies) I show Bitcoin to are already a little overwhelmed with Electrum.
Do you really and honestly think that regular, non-technical, people will be able to ever use bitcoin if that's the hoops they need to go through? "So you want to make a payment with bitcoin? Sure, after getting your wallet (which is difficult enough for newcomers) you can open up a lightning channel, fund it with the amount you want to pay, execute the transaction, wait for your partner(s) to accept it, close the channel and then you can go offline. Then the lightning transactions will need to confirm on-chain anyways, costing you fees twice. Of course you could also anticipate sending money to the same place in the future and just fund the channel with more money than you actually need for this payment. Easy, isn't it?"
Compared to: "So you want to make a payment with bitcoin? Sure, after getting your wallet (difficult, yadda yadda) you can type in the address and amount and send it, costing you fees once. Then you wait some time (all the while you can be offline) for it to be confirmed."

"Popularity of X that isn't used" isn't really a statement that makes sense. It's obviously used. Could it be that, and please bear with me, people were getting fed up with Bitcoins shortcomings? Namely fees at an unholy level, being slow AF compared to most of your examples and having no real scaling roadmap except for "let's not use the chain anymore lol" and not really counting signatures when calculating size. I mean, sure BTC was the first and best for some time. But that's not true anymore and it's painfully obvious.

I feel like we are arguing nothing more but semantics. I absolutely agree that bugs are to be fixed and that consensus will be reached almost all of the time.

Sure, but what do you do for the network that gives you the right to decide on its path? Are you producing the code that actually runs it? Is it that you secure the network by investing money into mining machines? If it's neither then you have as much say as my grandmother and you won't get to decide on bitcoins future because miners do that. It's 1CPU = 1vote, not 1IP =1vote. You can choose to use or not and/or advocate your idea but you don't have a right to vote according to the protocol. Only miners do, by setting signalling bits in the blocks they mined.
Also, in my opinion bitcoin is indeed slightly broken in its current state. Look at transaction numbers. They have been stagnant ever since the block limit was hit regularly. Not so in other cryptos. Bitcoin has lost more than half of its market share in the last two years. Eth brings confirmation in just a few minutes with VERY low fees. Iota doesn't even have fees and confirms in seconds. Aside from the first mover advantage I don't see any technical advantage btc has over the countless alts. If we take away that by introducing astronomical fees - even paying half a dollar for a ten dollar transaction is more than a lot of people can afford - I see literally no reason for bitcoin to stay the top currency. All this could be fixed easily by increasing the value of a few variables to something a little bigger.
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:07:36

It is somewhat IO intensive when syncing. Not a problem with an SSD, but haters gonna hate. It's a little worse than the Bitcoin chain, which took a grand total of five hours to sync a few days ago for me. Eth takes around seven to eight. Once synced it's no more of a problem than BTC.

It was that time where trading volume was the highest. The fact that bitcoin can't handle any largish amount of transactions remains and isn't going to change. When the next "blimp" happens we're going to have the exact same discussions we've had for years, transaction fees are going to go through the roof again and transactions will, again, be stuck for weeks or months. Nothing has changed, except there are now fewer people using it.


Which is not a good thing.


You can't really be a store of value if it's rather worthless as a currency, so currency must come first.


How so? At which point do we say "enough is enough. No more new people using bitcoin are allowed"? It's not a "noble cursade" but something to strife for. I think literally every person on the planet should have a bitcoin wallet and actively use it. Why is that pointless, other than the fact that, as it is now, the network can't sustain even a few hundred thousand people regularly using it?


Which isn't really how it's supposed to be, imo. I'd prefer if more people actually got paid for their work and then used it to pay for stuff. You know, like a currency. Currently it's more like a gift card that changes value each day.

Do you have ANY idea how expensive this stuff is? My company had to build and repair access roads (owned by the town, but that's another story...) and let me tell you that simply no private citizen can afford this stuff. We aren't a small company but a bridge? lol. No way we would let anyone use it for free (edit: that's if it wasn't just for us - obv. access roads would be free). Have fun paying at every third intersection...


So the family of five that has just enough income to eat and live hires private security? Or the owner of the building? No government subsidized housing so hundreds of thousands of people without places to live. Thousands dead because they can't afford to eat.


Again, driving up the number of homeless people. Not everyone earns enough to live.


I'm sorry but HAHAHAHA. I don't know if you already have to pay for ambulance rides in the USA (but I guess so...) but I imagine it goes something like: "No, don't get the MediLife paramedics, they charge extra for the ECG. Ahhm, no, DirectMed isn't good as well, they charge 100$ per kilometer and a fee. Oh, you wouldn't want to ride with MedUber, that one driver I had smoked crack in there."
Do you REALLY want to have private companies have control over who takes a med transport and who doesn't?

Right, and I agree, but not in this case. OP was making a point about the technical nature of various bitcoin clients, their forks and how they relate to each other. Technically all bitcoin forks are variants of the bitcoin core software and I think that should be allowed to be pointed out.

I don't like how the discussion progressed and I agree that bitcoin cash seems to be the exception to rule 4 (which I don't like - either ban all altcoin discussion or none). OP made a technically true statement about how different bit-/altcoin clients relate to each other and the overwhelming majority of answers is about how OP is trying to create some narrative or to scam newbies or how about this sub is only about Bitcoin discussion. I don't think OP was trying to scam anyone, they were simply pointing out something about the software.
As I said, I think a healthy amount of discussion about related topics (other chains/clients included) should be allowed. OPs comment could have easily been dealt with without going on about bitcoin cash and scamming:
"There are forks of bitcoin and they use the same software and genesis block. nobody talks about it on here"
"That's because this sub is only about bitcoin itself. See rule 4 in the sidebar."

I don't think anyone would consider a completely different chain Bitcoin. A fork is different (IMO) and the majority is to decide whether it's valid or not.

Bitcoin is clearly the chain with the most accumulated proof of work, as pointed out multiple times in the whitepaper and in various mailing list entries by Satoshi. So if the new chain overtakes the current one (just in terms of invested POW, not market cap or anything else) it IS bitcoin, by definition. Not taking a side here, just pointing that out.
