Yes, this is called a realized loss or capital loss.  In most cases, it directly offsets capital realized gains.  In 2012, not sure about 2013, people could even deducted up to $3,000 from their income due to capital losses if filing jointly.

Also a local in Vietnam.  Bitcoin is pretty much nonexistent here.  This article is heavily skewed positively.
Another thing, inflation has been an issue, but the Dong has remained stable with the dollar for over two years now.  But, yes, prices are increasing.

Summary for those interested.
Dread Pirate Roberts, known in the beginning simply as Ross Ulbricht, was interested in physics and enrolled in a graduate program.  He became intensely focused on economic theory, particularly free-market ideas.  His political beliefs began to skew heavily toward libertarianism.  
He posted a "rant" of sorts on his LinkedIn page decrying governmental interference in the economy and claimed that every transaction happening outside of their control was an achievement.  On this same page, he stated that he was working on an economic project/model which would allow users to operate with complete impunity.  He did say that he was specifically working on Silk Road.
Silk Road appeared in 2011 and Ross initially kept a low profile.  He began to interact more with the community and set up the escrow system to allow for more secure transactions.  During this time, he told the community that he was changing his name to Dread Pirate Roberts.  He became a celebrity in this subculture rather quickly.  He also amassed nearly $80,000,000 worth of Bitcoin.
A DEA agent with the username Nob messaged Dread Pirate Roberts to broker a "big" deal.  He claimed that he was part of an international drug syndicate and didn't want to engage in small transactions.  He would only do a minimum of 10 kilograms of product.  DPR said he would get back to Nob.  He contacted his right hand man, who also helped run the site's escrow system, and the right hand man agreed to work with Nob.
His close associate had the package (10 kg) sent to his home address in Utah.  The DEA quickly arrested him. The NPR reporters wonder aloud why he would have the package sent directly to his home address.  Because this man had access and control to a large portion of Silk Road's escrow funds, the bitcoins disappeared.  Unbeknownst to DPR at the time, this man was actually in the custody of the DEA.  He sent Nob a request asking for the associate to be tortured and the "stolen" Bitcoins forcefully sent back.  Soon after this request, DPR read in the newspaper that the man had actually been apprehended by police.  
It was at this point that DPR no longer wanted him tortured, but assassinated.  He feared that the arrest could lead back to him somehow.  He messaged Nob with a change of request form asking for the associate to be murdered, "silenced."  DPR justified his request both to himself and to Nob by stating the necessity of it.  
The associate, likely wanted a reduced sentence, agreed to cooperate with the police.  They staged a fake execution with photos and other convincing evidence.  Nob sent the photos to DPR, and DPR quickly wired Nob $80,000.
Here's where the report gets sketchy and a little lacking in journalism.  At this stage, the police had DPR for attempted murder and a litany of other crimes, but they had no clue who he was.
The NPR report quickly glossed over how the police somehow learned that the server was located in Iceland.  Once that happened, it was simply a matter of following the data trail.  It eventually led them to a library in San Francisco.
When DPR, Ross, was arrested, he had his laptop open to the silk road administrator page and all of his Bitcoins on the same laptop.  
Caught red-handed.
Now the question is, how did the police actually glean that the server's location was in Iceland?  They're not telling.

Assuming tax laws stay the same, and also assuming you're unmarried, if you were to SELL the $50,000 worth of Bitcoin four years later, you would pay capital gains tax on about $13,000 of those earnings.  This also assumes that you have no job and no other income.
If you have a job where you make at least $36,000 a year, you would be paying capital gains on all $50,000.
If you have a job making $25,000 a year, you would be paying capital gains on $39,000 of the sell.

15%.  You are in the third tax bracket (25% of income), which places you at 15% capital gains tax.  However, this is long-term.  If it's short-term (less than a year), then you are required to pay 25%.

While this is all true, let's not pretend that volatility and risk don't exist at all, lol.  Those accounts given you 4-6% fluctuate 5-10% on an extremely bad day.  Bitcoin does that on good days.

I live in a low-income neighborhood, and the amount of welfare and food stamp misuse is staggering.  For example, many people in my neighborhood store all of their cash in safety deposit boxes so it appears they have no assets.  No assets = food stamps and welfare.
Another frustrating observation is people using their EBT cards to buy candy, sugary drinks, and other food completely lacking in nutrition and then using their cash to purchase $40 in scratch-off lottery tickets.
I used to think like you before I lived in a lower-income neighborhood.  I grew up in rich, white suburbia, but living on the other side of the fence has really opened my eyes to the abuse.
The system doesn't need to go away entirely, but it is clearly in need of vast reform.

Yeah, it seems the MORE convenient it is to mine, the more difficult it will be as more people and more processing power saturates the creation of new blocks.

That was really good.  I like that people are thinking outside the box for Bitcoin.  I think it's really cool that there is a public ledger that everyone has access too, and so does Stefan Molyneux.  You can create an intellectual work, encrypt it, and put it on the blockchain as proof of you having created it first.  It's really quite amazing.
How you put something like the novel you wrote on the blockchain I'm not sure.  Anyone care to chime in?

I don't use multibit, but I'm guessing that if you have a compatible wallet, you can import it into the multibit client.  You will not have a combined wallet to my knowledge, but two separate wallets on the multibit client.  Whatever phone client you're using, you might not be able to import the multibit wallet to it.  I actually don't have a lot of experience using Bitcoin on phones.  I use Armory and Bitcoin QT on my computer.  I keep about $50 in Coinbase's website for whatever.  
However, Multibit should have a "back up" wallet function that is not "import/export."  On teh QT client, it clearly says "back up wallet."  So does Armory.

I disagree with your premise that you can successfully time the market more often than get burned.  It might work for some short-term gains, but it only takes one bad turn of events to wipe out years of profits.
I am a buy and hold kind of guy, who also tries to spend bitcoin whenever possible.  When I spend it, I immediately replace it with more bitcoin so the stash stays static.

What wallet are you using now?  Just create a new one using the client you want to use and transfer the coins.  
Also don't let the fees discourage you right now!  The reason they're high is because the price rise has been astronomical and the bitcoin community hasn't had the chance to catch up.

You're not doing it wrong.  For microtransactions, there is a small fee, which apparently is set at 0.0002.  That equates to about 18 cents.  A little high to be honest.

In my experience, the fee is not fixed.  It can vary from .0001 to .0005.  I was goofing off on Armory (a Bitcoin wallet) today and the fee was .0005.  I was practicing making online wallets with $5, and .0005 was about 0.40 cents.  Pretty high.
