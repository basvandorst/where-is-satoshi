Hi, 
thanks for forking.
I have an idea and want to share it here. 
How should the routing be done?
If BM could route its traffic through a RetroShare network it could benefit from the RetroShare features. 
In this case each RetroShare node (v0.6+) should run as a Hidden Service inside the tor network (also possible is I2P or direct IP). 
So lets provide an example:
Alice wants to run an shop.
She creates a Tor Hidden Service "alice.bazaar.onion", and runs RetroShare behind it. The RetroShare node runs in TOR-mode only. 
RetroShare then runs a plugin which tunnels the OpenBazaar traffic inside the RetroShare network between RetroShare Nodes. Footnote 
alice.bazaar.onion adds now the node bob.bazaar.onion to her Friendlist. 
both can now communicate anonymously inside the TOR Network. Both openBazaar clients can now communicate. 
This is nothing special, just communication between two hidden nodes. 
Now RetroShare features kick in. 
For example Alice is running her Shop as hidden node alice.bazaar.onion and she has only a friendshipt to Carol
alice.bazaar.onion &lt;-&gt; carol.bazaar.onion &lt;-&gt; eve.onion &lt;-&gt; dave.onion &lt;-&gt; bob.bazaar.onion
The openBazaar traffic is now routed with the Turtle Plugin inside the RetroShare network 
from Alice to Carol to Eve to Dave to Bob. 
Alice and Bob are now able to share files, chat, mail with each other inside RetroShare. 
Their openBazaar traffic is now routed through the RetroShare net. Footnote 
In this example, Eve and Dave are not openBazaar users. They are only normal RetroShare-on-Tor Nodes. 
Eve is now able to create Forums and Chatrooms which share to all her direct friends. Each friend which shares the forums, forwards them again. Footnote  &amp; 
Chatrooms and forums are now decentralized. 
The communication between Alice and Bob is routed across the network and is of course encrypted. Footnote 
If there are more different routes available, Swarming like in bittorrent kicks in. 
Cross-Meshing nets are always better for RetroShare than Star like nets. 
Its possible to run an OpenBazaar chatserver like  to share initial or promotional chatrooms. 
So Bob is able to friend Alice directly, or search for mutual friends which are connected to Alice.

you need to go online, enter the BON code into their exchange, and receive the BTC amount on a priv wallet
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:58:18
its not a problem, just the headline is misleading. 
its like buying Paysafecards and changing them elsewhere into Bitcoin. i wouldn't call it direct bitcoin exchange. 
its just a voucher which is exchanged later online. 
i think it should be called voucher/Bon/coupon selling instead of "directly bitcoin selling"
i have already located one kiosk in my city, i'll try it this week. how it works. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:41:15
hi, 
You cannot buy bitcoins directly. this is misinterpretation by the media. 
You need to buy a bitcoin-coupon in the kiosk which is available for 25€, 50€ or 100€ and it is valued with € (no bitcoin exchange in the kiosk at all)
afterwards you need to go online and exchange the bitcoinbon/bicoincoupon and receive bitcoins to a private wallet. 
The exchange from EUR to BTC is done, when you go online and submit your coupon code.

it has a lot of functions. 
VOIP and other big parts are added as plugins. 
Most developers are workig at the moment at redesign and recoding of the whole cache thing.

hi 
When have you tested it on your mac?
I know the lead-developer is a Mac User and there are always some working builds available after release.

so, if the rating system sucks, don't use it. 
This is what i say. Bitcoin.de and his rating system is not working properly... 
cares anyone about eBays rating system? This is not working either, the sellers create always new shops and get fresh and clean new ratings. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:23:01
hopefully, Bitcoin.de is getting their major deal with a german bank, to have a giro-account for each of their EU-Users and all legal things cleared

Have a look at: 
* [List + HowTos](
**hidden inside Tor**
is possible with IPv6 implementation (planned for v0.6 release) 
* IPv6 transparent Tor VPN, 
* v0.6 Branch IPv6 commit: 
Your metadata is hidden/obfuscated, at least reduced and hidden in the other encrypted traffic if you run it always with some fixed friends. It reveals only static connection to 5-25 friends in your peer list. 
Your communication is encrypted and routed through the RetroShare Network to non friends too. 
* [distant-chat-and-messaging-using-generic-tunnels]( communication cross the network with non-peers are hidden. 
* [retroshares-anonymous-routing-model/]( turtle routing explained
* [ideals-behind-retroshare]( Development started 2006 and is growing
* [privacy-on-the-retroshare-network]( 
Have a try with RetroShare and find some friends with help of the ChatServers:
*  - hosted by Pirate Party Austria (HowTo inside)
*  - (community driven)
The ChatServer provides an opportunity to join the community and devs grouped around the core devs.  
If you do not want to add random strangers there, i understand that of course. RetroShare is perfect to start a small Island Darknet between your trusted friends only and let it grow by time or still be disconnected from the other RetroShare users for ever and keep it as a closed circle.

have you tried the latest version?
i know some MAC users with retroshare. 
But i use my own compiled programs on Debian, repositorys to openSuse, repo for ubuntu and the portable version for Windows. 
so keep the good Apple hardware and switch the Software to Gnu/Linux
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:48:28
bitcoin.de is working well if rates are increasing, 
but if they fall, the buyer has time to finalize for 24hours. if he doesn't finalize and pays the next day, he only get a bed remark and the seller get his coins back... 
I cannot recommend bitcoin.de for selling coins. only for buying...

Update: 
Diese Funktion steht nur eingeloggten Usern zur Verfügung. Bitte loggen Sie Sich ein oder melden Sich kostenlos bei uns an.
Seit gestern Abend 20.00 Uhr wurde die Frist innerhalb derer Käufer die Zahlung für einen Trade bestätigen müssen ("als bezahlt markieren") verkürzt: Banküberweisungen müssen nun innerhalb von 12 Stunden und Liberty-Reserve-Überweisungen innerhalb von 6 Stunden als ausgeführt markiert werden. Diese Regelung gilt für alle ab Freitag 20.00 Uhr abgeschlossenen Trades. Ein Unterlassen der Markierung oder eine Markierung ohne eine tatsächlich getätigte Zahlung kann zur Sperrung des Accounts führen.
Time to Confirm a Payment. 
SEPA reduced from 24 to 12 hours.
LibertyReserve from 12 to 6 hours. 
Cancel of Orders and not paying may result in a Ban from bitcoin.de, at least a bad rating.

done :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:06:36
bitcoin.de is not an exchange.
if you sell bitcoins, the buyer has 24hours time to pay or to cancel the trade...

chat, chat rooms, group chat, instant messaging, encryption&amp;security and file sharing are working rock solid and flawless
forums and channels are working fine distributed and decentralised. 
I haven't tested the plugins yet. 
The GUI was at 0.5.4c overloaded, but release 0.5.4e is better now. 
IMHO we are missing a WebInterface for headless control. If this step is done, Seedboxes are coming... 
Don't expect to find too much discussion in the RS WebForum. Becaus the most talk is done in the RS-internal forums. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 06:44:22
I stopped to trade with btcde, but watching regularly if they update something. 
there is no big difference in selling to gold and silver than to bronce. cancelations in all ratings states happen regularly.

nobody cares about bad ratings. 
Bad ratings cause a Bronce account. 
they have 24hours to confirm the payment. 
maybe they confirm in hour 23.5 and pay 48 hours or 72 later. or they cancel the order. 
and nobody cares about the bad rating afterwards.
