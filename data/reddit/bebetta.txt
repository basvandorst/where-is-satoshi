Why would it mean that?

Wow! I'm sorry that you've had to deal with so much intrusion and publicity.  I certainly hope life gets back to normal for Dorian and your family quickly!

The article says they moved to California in 1959, so no.

It's satire.

I was just answering his question, but his family was not firebombed when he was a baby either. He was born after WWII in Beppu. 
I'm not arguing about the effect of WWII on this guy, but if we're going to suppose things about him based on history, we should at least start with actual historic facts.
Here are a few that I think might be even more interesting, based on the age and bio of the man in the article: 
He came of age in 1960's California with hippies, Vietnam and worldwide turmoil. He'd have seen images of Thich Quang Duc burning himself alive in Saigon - surely a profound sight for the son of a Buddhist priest.
He was a college student/young graduate in the seventies when the US abandoned the gold standard and the dollar became fiat currency. He saw price controls, stagflation and gas lines. And in the eighties, the rise of Gordon Gekko-style Wall Street banking and the S&amp;L crisis. Keep going with the dot-com bubble, the housing boom and the crash that led to the Great Recession. All of that was made possible by the US transition to fiat currency.
As for Japan, his family there would have lived through the bubble economy and subsequent stock crash (1990) that led to the lost decade(s), with falling GDP, bailouts and stimulus - failures that can be blamed on monetary policy.
So if we're looking for historical context to guess what led him to create Bitcoin, I doubt we need to go all the way back to WWII, before he was even born. A man of Dorian S. Nakamoto's age has experienced plenty of specific government-sanctioned monetary failures in his lifetime. More than enough to drive him to create a currency that isn't controlled by a single government's policies.

Not the finest satire, but still an amusing jab at some of the reactions to Mt. Gox and other challenges Bitcoin has faced.
