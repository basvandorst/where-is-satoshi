And buy more once it slows down again. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:12:59
Oh man if he was hodling that till now that pizza changed his life :-D
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:26:00
Most exchanges are crashing or in “maintenance”
Even the small exchange I use  which was never down is now not able to sell/buy bitcoin
Something is going on. Imma just turn off and wait and see ��

I wonder how rich that dude is now
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:55:05

I’ve cashed out initial investments and then some. I’m good. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:12:00
Bitcoin got a lot of news coverage over the last few weeks. Since it broke through 10k and everyone and his mother wanted in for the the quick money grab. Those are the people getting burned now. 
Good riddance imo. 
But hopefully the community/devs can figure something out cause those fees are not normal anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:10:46
My local newspaper be like
„Bitcoin is falling down dramatically“
When 30 days ago we were still at 8k ��‍♂️
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:25:04
delet this
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:44:46
I would've bought at 11k but my exchange of choice is running low on coins FeelsBadMan
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:51:24
I’m just watching the charts a bit and if you have big bucks aka are a whale you can make some good money. 
Just saw a 17btc buy order at 15.9k and a 17btc sell order at 16.4k (time difference being 5min)
Let’s assume it’s the same person, if so that person just made 8.5k in 5min. 
Now do that a few hours and you have yourself some money. 
But and this is a big but, could also move the other way and you loose 8.5k in minutes if another whale jumps in and sells.
Your method is safer tho for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:14:49
Was it only 34% it went to almost 10k from 20k on gdax.

Bitcoin is dead again. Oh well. 
BUUUUY THE DIP
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:10:35
Better leave it that way LOL
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:27:25
Just make an account on an exchange. And then cash out a few coins every day. I doubt any exchange has the liquidity for 25'000 coins. 
Also I would probably get an accountant that helps you with taxation and stuff. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:24:28
So they get some sweet donations. Like that other dude who got 50 bucks because he bought his first 50$ in btc. 
16 too btw /s

Hoooly is ripple getting pumped again?
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:29:03
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:00:40
Bought at 3950 and it's going down again. 
Oh well buy some more then. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:16:36
I see.
Thx a lot man. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:30:09
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:37:32
People call me crazy for having more than 500 bucks on a phone wallet and you have 8500 on an exchange?
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:08:35
Well that "fork" was pretty anti climatic 
I was expecting crazy price changes but on both sides or a pump/dump war between them (since so many people said they'd do exactly that)
Why are thr bch folks not dropping their btc? Isn't it the superior coin to them and btc has no future?
I wanted some drama man :-P
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:27:45
If we break 5000$ without a correction down before we're gonna go far. 
LET'S DO IT THEN. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:32:46
The 21.5 million pizza
And the post which brought me into btc 3 months ago
FeelsGoodMan price now more than doubled
@_date: 2017-08-14 17:33:48
Someone remember the pizza billboard?
That pizza is now worth 21.5 million LOL
Shit's ridiculous and I love it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:00:51
What causes a drop?
Well it's quite simple actually, price drops if there are more people that sell bitcoin than there are people that buy bitcoin. 
Could happen at 4k or maybe not. 
Could also not happen until we're at 10k there isn't really a way to predict it. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:19:09
That's amazing. Good for her accepting it then. :-)
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:32:30
And I was thinking I was buying high when I bought again at 2400$ a few weeks ago LOL
What a time to be alive
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:24:48
Make this a thing LOL 
Every year we link to the previous post 
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:12:25
So same as Aug. 1st fork. 
Leave them on the wallet and don't spend until stuff is figured out?
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:58:02
BCH is up like 50%

@_date: 2017-11-30 14:47:17

@_date: 2017-11-16 16:02:17
LOL at the guy saying I was gonna get rekt when I sold all my bch for btc during the pump. 
Who’s laughing now?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:57:32
I mean the memes reaching Nr.1 on r/all certainly help I would think
Tons of people see that shit, matter of fact why I bought bitcoin in may 2017 when it was like 1.8k because the 10'000 bitcoin pizza was on the frontpage (Memes makin me money who would've thought LOL)
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:03:06
Finnaly dumped my BCash and got me some Bitcoin which is currently on a sale. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:18:04
I sold some at 10k thanks to everyone who bought my coins thank you very much ��
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:11:25
Just checked it’s up to 1.4k and I wanted to dump them at 600 good thing I waited. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:05:17
DON'T INVEST MORE THAN YOU'RE WILLING TO LOOSE
Or just you cash out initial investments once you made enough gains and then it's just free money if it goes up or no free money if it goes down but no loss on your side.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:30:09
So you’re telling me everyone is dumping bitcoin for Bcash?
Is that why Bcash went down from 2.4k again? LOL
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:36:47

@_date: 2017-11-29 17:22:36
Cash out your initial investments?
I did the same and now I sleep even better. No matter were the price goes. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:15:54
I sold all my initial investments in bitcoin at 10k 
Still have bitcoin tho, now I can truly sleep well no matter if it goes up or down I’m in the clear :-D

No we need to proof that we can last.

Pretty unethical. But yeah if money is all you live for it would be. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:53:56
You don't lose money if you HODL
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:23:20
Just a little joke bro
If someone didn't know it would drop after it climbed from a steady 1800$ to 2800$ in a matter of a few days they should not trade with crypto. 
As for the hodlers well they don't care. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:00:52
Better imvest some more now and finish up my whole bitcoin before it shoots to 10k
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:13:22
So buy Bitcoin international and sell in South Korea gotcha
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:17:33
Maybe it only dropped because you told everyone to sell ��
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:09:00
I speculate with xrp, dgb, sc etc. because I kinda like trying to beat the market. If it works I get some profit, if not well t'was fun.
As for bitcoin, well the amount I have never goes down only up with monthly buy ins and most profit I get from trading other crypto coins
Because in the long run, I do believe bitcoin can replace our current money situation in some sort. That's why I'm in it. Because I believe in it.
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:20:11
I'd buy that LOL
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:04:20
How is rich people buying in a sign of a bubble?
You should be worried if the cashier at your supermarket suddenly starts talking about it not a guy who has millions. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:09:31
Gotcha thx for the answers :-)
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:02:36
Ohh so you use the webpage one and not the app?
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:18:33
600$ probably ��
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:17:59
nah still swinging between 1800 and 1600 downwards slope starting again by the looks of it
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:58:07
No way it dips to 0$
Bitcoin got so much attention the last month once people see that it is past 1500$ they will but like crazy
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:11:04
Did he buy the Lambo with bitcoins tho ����
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:51:41
Guys upvote this as hard, no even harder as the memes. 
This literally shows how amazing bitcoin can be in real life application 
OP I hope you and your family are getting through this. All the best man. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:01:35
when I woke up and looked up the price that was a nice WTF moment LOL
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:08:13
I'm going to say this, Bitcoin definitely has the biggest adoption rate so far concerning stores and users and such.
But I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say it doesn't have to be bitcoin which prevails at the end. One thing I'm certain with is that the technology behind it (blockchain) is something worth investing in wether that be bitcoin or another cryptocurrency.
(Don't keep all your eggs in the same basket)
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:53:23
It was 1000$ cheaper when I last bought in and I thought that was high. 
Holy shit bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:03:38
I'm buying more tbh 
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:16:50
It's beautiful 
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:55:59
Best case scenario everyone pays the 300 bitcoin. More demand = higher price
And then the hackers get busted and they hide the offline wallets before the cops get to them and thus removing them from the market flow = higher price /s 
Little joke, but seriously �� isn't this kind of news what scares away the "normal" citizen which bitcoin could use as active Users?
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:22:31
What if sold at 2800 and bought again at 1800 tho?
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:48:37
Bold move from me but calling 750$
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:48:24
"economical disaster"
Calm down bro LOL, little price drop never hurt nobody
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:50:44
Which phone wallet do you trust with so much money?
Why not drop most in an offline wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:59:01
Hoooooooly you're rich dude. ��
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:14:32
Brb buying 10 whole bitcoin right now
If I'm not rich as fuck in 3 years I at least get to enjoy this show LOL
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:26:27
If this is true hope that it reaches the 2k mark in the next few days and sell out again. 
And then buy in again but in a healthier manner. 
Don't just gamble all your money on one horse man. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:57:33
So you have an offline wallet and still 300k in the phone wallet? That's crazy. 
I reckon blockchain is pretty safe then, might switch to it too
