How about the futures markets opening up within the next week?

Getting paid monthly is a blessing and a curse... I envy those that get paid every Friday when it comes to buying bitcoin

Unfortunately this is what happens when people who have essentially zero knowledge of markets read a few investopedia posts and think they know it all. Wall Street doesn't actually do stupid shit like try to crash a price to make money on some futures. They're just infinitely better at trading then the average Joe. Easier to pretend they're evil law breakers than smart people who have a real plan though.

What are even you talking about? The original cellphones are long gone. Going by your analogy this means bitcoin will disappear when much better coins take over.

Salty? I didn't give an opinion whether bitcoin would succeed or fail in the long term. I just pointed out the stupidity of your analogy

So your only contribution to this thread is "pay me," in other words?

So basically your point is that technology evolves. What a shocker. Yeah, it does look like I'm the stupid one for assuming your specific examples meant more than just "as time passes things get better"

If you're changing your mind back and forth based on individual replies.. stop tagging anyone as anything and do your own research.

Then what are you arguing? Nobody here has suggested going an illegal route, so you're here tooting your own horn for no reason whatsoever.

If you could legally pay less how is it cheating?
