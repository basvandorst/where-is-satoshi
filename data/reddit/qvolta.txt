Here is an explanation of why P2P exchange is the safest place to buy bitcoin using a credit card.
1. A scam is absolutely out of the question because the traders' bitcoins are deposited on the exchange platform. Let's look at this case closely. You want to buy bitcoins using a credit card. You choose the most advantageous offer in your region. Next, you look at the seller's rating and the number of transactions. Making sure that the seller is reliable, you go to the deal with the trader. For example, you want to buy 1 BTC for $10k USD. Trader's bitcoins are deposited on the platform and you can be sure that they will be transferred to your wallet after you transfer the money to the seller. If the trader tries to deceive you, you just need to provide minimal proofs of transferring money to his bank account. And then the platform will transfer to you the amount of deposited bitcoins. Traders' bitcoins deposited for a one hour, at this time trader can't do anything with them, he can only send them to your wallet.
2. P2P exchanges can not suddenly close. P2P exchange platforms don't keep fiat money (USD, YEN, GBP or other currency). Therefore, regulators don't consider the activity of P2P exchanges as financial. This allows P2P exchanges to remain in legal neutrality.
3. Buy your first bitcoin on the P2P exchange is very simple. Firstly, you don't need to wait a long time to approve your account. Secondly, P2P exchanges have mobile versions. So you can even buy or sell bitcoin for a couple of minutes anywhere using the mobile app.
4. The P2P exchange is secure because it has 2FA security and other privacy settings. Therefore, only you can enter your own account and nobody else.
We will soon launch the most secure P2P exchange platform with the lowest fees. Qvolta P2P exchange platform will be released in the desktop version and mobile app, so you can buy or sell the cryptocurrency for a couple of minutes anywhere in the world. On the platform you can buy or sell bitcoin, ethereum and altcoins in one place. We have Qvolta Secure App - two-factor authentication application to ensure maximum security and feedback.
