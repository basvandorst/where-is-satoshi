Some clerk at a chinese gas station told me that we should all accept bitcoin since my bill wasn't high enough for me to use my credit card, kind of shocked me in a good way.
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:36:21
tried that, ended up checking during an exam

If that kind of ''population'' you're talking about is too stupid to use bitcoin, then bitcoin won't be widespread at all.
Besides, don't think that everyone who listens to rap is stupid, if a popular rapper uses bitcoin, it will get alot of media coverage.

vice is shit, seriously.
just look at how they see quebec and youll see what im talking about.
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:57:22
And yeah, although i've earned money with btc, the real life knowledge i got from it doesn't have a price.
I wonder how I would've learned that stuff if it wasn't from bitcoin.

you can use your desktop's camera and scan the qr code, or, you could send it by email to your desktop and use a website to translate the qr code

I don't get it.
Is he jewish or muslim or something like that?
Looking at the banner on his website, it's seems like he could be ''muslim'' with his beard and the banner..
But he just looks like a crazy fucker or a troll
@_date: 2014-07-21 23:22:59
It's at the montreal bitcoin embassy :D
@_date: 2014-07-21 23:23:45
Makes me proud of being a montrealer, anyone who lives in quebec should go there, i love it
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:16:25
I love this machine, i really want to make my own
I wonder how i could make one of these, i could possibly put one in my college hallway or at my metro station.
This is really awesome and somehow cute lol
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:01:10
what the hell?
the bitcoin atm in my city literally takes less than a minute, and there's a beautiful lady that guides you through the process.
@_date: 2014-05-28 13:13:15
I'm muslim myself.
There's nothing racist with my post, if you go on his website you will see the arabic lettrage banner, that's why i was wondering if he was muslim or jewish.
@_date: 2014-07-26 01:01:41
Are you serious..?
i think i lost a few brain cells reading your comment.

1.6k for a stand ?
umm... how about no
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:34:45
Why should we defend this guy ?
He opened an annonymous drug market online..
I know that he somehow did good for bitcoin, but he knew the risks of doing that,  he shouldn't just get a free get out of jail card just because he was using bitcoin..
Again, I don't really know alot about his case, and i'd be glad to see him out of jail since he probably hurted now one, but he knew the risks.
Perhaps someone could educate me on his case, since I didn't really search about it alot, but it's only my honest opinion.

that really sucks, dont know when karpeles will release funds
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:48:57

I know a lot of teens that are interested in bitcoins.
My little brother has a big batch of them.
I'm glad to see this.. don't forget it educates and introduces them to the world of markets
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:55:49

Aaaaaaaaaaand you've lost.
Well, almost, bitstamp is at 436.7.
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:20:10
That's really fucking gay.
The ATM in my town only requires sms verification, after that, you can buy up to 3k in bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:39:50
yeah absolutely, test it with 2mbtc, it really does work.
