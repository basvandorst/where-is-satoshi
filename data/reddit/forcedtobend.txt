He's right. Bitcoin is a single "application" which happens to be the first. You could use the current Blockchain to build any number of decentralized software without re-building the whole infrastructure and obtaining nodes.

There would be no accuracy with any estimations.
 When selling Bitcoins for example (in localbits) you first transfer the funds to a given address,  which is automatically transferred x2,  then finally transferred to the sellers address, which will possibly be transferred x2 again to a different hot wallet.

you're absolutely correct. On (what we now know as Bitcoin) each bitcoin transactions, there's an OP_return method which could be used to store arbitrary data. This is a very special feature for build other decentralized applications. Toront is also right. There wouldn't be a blockchain (or Bitcoin) with one having a monetary value. But, Bitcoin (what we now know as Bitcoin) could have been an built with an absolutely different purpose, but still offer the same functionalities, of course these decisions were fixed based on series of events and scenarios from the past ... ...

Its good to analyse, you seriously can take chainanalysis as factual.
I'm surprised these criminals don't use a percentage of their earnings to taint the thousands of addresses, before moving forward, as part of the crowd. 
Furthermore, why wouldn't anyone use decentralised exchanges if the coins are stolen? - Even using a mixing provider and spreading the funds into several addresses is enough to make chainanalysis null ... I wonder how they'll analysis physical exchange of Bitcoin addresses using cash.

If you want to run a regulated Bitcoin exchange which handles fiat then you will need a licence from the municipality where this company exists. If not you will be the next Silk Road and never be allowed to have your identity revealed or face long prison sentences. TBH Dude-Lebowski, most firms want to be able to trade legally with fiat, because they wouldn't have to worry about going to jail and may possibly have long sustaining businesses, which would be constantly producing profits, that's not at risk of being shutdown [...]

Increase the blocksize, would speed up the speed at which the blockchain increasees. This in turn makes bitcoin more centralised since less, and less individual would be capable of downloading/hosting a full node.

Could you post a link to your current source code? I'm guessing it was not uploaded to GitHub today.
And how will the private keys be protected/encrypted? Will the user be forced to enter their password each time a browser is opened? Or will it just be a free for all for any virus and programs that wants a free prepaid Bitcoin addresses?
Since it's open source, what data will the program be sending to your servers (If any) and why does it need to connect to your servers at all
@_date: 2015-04-09 00:45:28
I totally agree with you, but theres between 250k to 1.2m individual users using Bitcoin (with illegal activities making-up a majority, and chrome only accounting for a fraction of those users) That's a fairly small amount to work with however you look at it. Until we can convince more users to try Bitcoin, instead their regular methods of transactions, you'll have a fairly hard time getting this to work. But if you guys are good at marketing, anything is possible. 
 
@_date: 2015-04-09 01:52:44
I have to say, it is a nice project. But the problem still sticks, how are you going to get more awareness for this sort of extension (marketing) what about mobile users, who are vastly outgrowing PC devices? 
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:01:58
Actually there is.  Individuals would be able to contribute pieces of code, like they did, to built the chromium project (Google chrome)
It speeds up development time, find vulnerabilities much more faster, give developers the satisfaction that their code will be used in the program release, and significantly reduces costs. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 02:15:26
Well I wish you guys all the best, hopefully you can convince some viners, vloggers and gamers to start using it. 
P.s. You'll have to think about encrypting and holding the wallet keys sever-side, and produce a unique ID, then link the id to unqiue IP address (use cookies too), which would all mobile users who have already registered with the app, to pay using an embedded form by the....

There's a bitcoin forum, the main Bitcoin forum, where every Bitcoin miner, developer and so on use to keep in touch with upcoming news. Http://bitcointalk.org this forum was created by the owner of Bitcoin. If any problem raises, it'll simply be showed their and new updates will be installed. I'm guessing you've always been told to download the latest update? The miners would check for updates regularly, to make sure they are upto date, it's that simple.

More users now seem to have adBlocker as part of theirbrowser extensions. With so much websites forcing them to use these extensions, what makes you think they will start tipping? Unless they have money to give away, in most cases with adBlocker they can get the content free and continue with paying anything. At this moment, theirs also not that many Bitcoin 'aware' users for this sort of product to go viral.

I found this  posted a few days ago. I think it's a good idea 
@_date: 2015-04-09 01:05:05
A tipping system is a good idea, but I really don't see any gain for me to top-up a Bitcoin address, which I will have no gain to me, using a technology "from a users perspective" which could put my personal details and computer at risk. 
Now this idea would be extremely awesome, if it was built by a non-profit organisation "I'm guessing it's for profit" As you've said, it's open source, how would you make money? If you decide to make it closed-source, why would anyone trust the extension you're giving them on their browsers, given the likes of mega companies such as Mt. Gox, with a good reputation, but disappeared with billions?

There's no owner of Bitcoin, it's a decentralised system. I'm trying to say, that theres a main Bitcoin forum, which can notice developers and miners about any issues, although it wouldn't be needed because everyone would always update to the latest, verified and stable version of a release

For anyone looking for an example, you can download one here  
One contains no data, the other contains a wallet with 100 keys. The password to unlock the encrypted flower is: flower
The size of the stored data is 4.22kb. The size of the original file is 1.61MB. The size of the encrypted file is 0.99MB
More? 
The passwords are converted to sha1, and two 16 character long keys from that hash are used to encrypt you wallet in AES 128-bit two times. Additional option such as BIP38 &amp; AES 256 will be added for cross-application support.
@_date: 2016-07-25 21:45:41
I'm not sure if anyone has already asked this, but what will be the repercussion of this decision.
@_date: 2016-07-23 17:04:59
Drop the altered one into the app, enter the correct password. and a file with all keys will be delivered to you. In all honesty, it uses wizardry &amp; mystical magical powers.
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:07:22
About that.. okay
I've just edited an encrypted image with paint (added a small marker) yet i was still able to retrieve the stored data. 
Thank you for bringing up this point, i'm actually going to see how much i can edit the flower image, and still be able to retrieve the stored data.
TEST  I draw a long line across the encrypted image. *Still retrieved the data*
TEST  I draw a large square box coloured in black &amp; also used the bucket tool on the image. *Still retrieved the data*
conclusion: The software is resilient to change. Try it yourself. draw a line on the image, and you'll still be able to retrieve your wallet data.

I like your points, its good get refreshing points of views. For the encryption part, i think the first packaged installer with independent libraries will use AES 256-bit so that's not a problem. 
The software is also resistant to compression. I've also just converted the flower file from PNG to BMP, and was still able to obtain the wallet with 100 keys. Hopefully it'll be resistance to more alteration.

I don't think there is, since each wallet is uniquely encrypted into random data (nonsense) before being converted to 0's and 1's and being stored in pixels.

I like your views. But I feel like you have no clue about what this project is about. if you want to print something out, use QR it wasn't made for nothing. 
I also feel like you have no idea about how computers work. Are you telling me, that from reading all my explanations on this thread, you were able to conclude that it's possible to read pixels of data from a printed image?
I really don't won't to be harsh, but please read more about cryptography (specially how entropy works) before making posts.  Some of your points are highly inaccurate and misleading.
If pixels are pretty much invisble to the human eye, and the project is about storing data in pixels, *with your computing background* , did you really think that you could print digital images to the physical images, which draw every colour, pixel by pixel on *paper*!!?
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:10:05
I understand your point of view. The point of this project, is to actually bring out ideas, with people bringing out researches as to how to logical improve it. [gmaxwell]( is one of the first people to actually contribute an idea. I'll implement his method on the first release, and probably re-write the libraries by myself. Hopefully we'll get more forwarding ideas and concern from supporters like yourself, which is why i actually like your posts.
