And just because I’ve been using reddit for six years doesn’t mean I’ve *actively* been using it for six years.

He may be right about bitpay being shit, which I realized once I searched reddit for bitpay for the first time, but the ‘wake up sheeple’ act is obnoxious

Not all of us use bitcoin.reddit.com. I searched the App Store for a wallet and it was among the first to come up. Up until now I’ve had no issues. Your horse is far too high, my good man.

I dig it. I’m done using it after this time. Up until now, I had no reason to look further into it from my point of view. It was simply a wallet serving its function that allowed me to access them easily from my phone. I used mycelium before then and they constantly dumped my entire balance into transaction fees.

Uhhh—yeah, actually. Check my posts. :p This is the first time I’ve used it save for reading one or two articles in a blue moon.

Just found on their Twitter apparently they’re aware of the problem and are working to resolve it now (they said so ~30 minutes ago) 
Would be nice if they’d say that on their website...

I’m on IPhone so I’ll check out Bread Wallet, yeah. Thanks. :)

That all of my posts in r/bitcoin are this post and that I posted in songwriting a lot?

Already had this discussion in other comments, hehe. But now that I’m aware of bitpay’s issues, I’m definitely looking at alternatives. Looks like the winner for me is Blockstream’s iOS wallet based on what said. :)
