Liquidate the card into your PayPal account and then into your bank account. It's kind of a chore but definitely doable. Had to do it one time when I won a pretty decent gift card at work.

"Real Bitcoin" sounds like what Roger V will start after bcash crashes. This time the icon will be a horizontal B and will surely destroy Bitcoin...!

Tf out of here with that FUD.

Wondering the same thing. Is Bitfinex any good? Looking to pick up for XPR as well.

Yes, Roger is scum, we know this. Stop spamming.

Coinbase to GDAX then from GDAX to your wallet. Ezpz.

Coinbase/gdax added Bitcoin Cash and people freaked out. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:55:35
It's surprisingly fast in my experience. Took maybe 10 minutes and GDAX eats the outrageous fee on Coinbase's end.

I thought the same thing. Had to Google it myself to confirm it was legit... shame.
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:06:47
Oh God oh yes... right there...

It will be between $0.05 and $5,000,000. Somewhere around there.
@_date: 2018-02-21 18:55:46
So you got my point, then?
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:21:32
It's a definite maybe.

2020 is my bet for widespread adoption. Not "grandma has a Facebook" adoption, but "grandma now has a cell phone" adoption if that makes any sense.

It'll get good at $9,000+, just hang tight.
