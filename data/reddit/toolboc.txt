So far, some of the best ways of garnering BTC adoption among poor people have included [MLM-like Ponzi schemes with an altcoin element to ease liquidity by the parent in an inevitable exit ](  [selling hype to the uninformed on the basis of profit sharing operations which leverage cloud powered quantum computer mining pools]( and of course BTC backed gambling sites which employ "provably fair" odds to those looking to let "luck" decide their financial fate.

* Furthermore, none of this is a monetary donation until the BTC has been successfully exchanged to USD

Couldn't the same could be said about Satoshi/BTC?

I created a simple ticker using an Intel Edison and Seeed Grove Kit.  It can also create audible alerts based on a volatility index.  Parts would be around $60 - $80.

Full Disclosure, I work for MSFT:
Q: What happens when you don't update an old version of Linux that contains vulnerable packages?  
A: It gets PWND
Perhaps Windows doesn't want users to get PWND?

It's actually similar in concept to [btcvol.info]( in that it computes a Volatility Index and allows you sound an alert if the index exceeds a certain value.  The idea was that this would be useful as an alarm in the case of an incident like Mt. Got, Bitfinex, or MMM.  If you watch the included video, the whole Bitfinex thing was actually going on as we were filming it.  The core idea is a device that alerts on "to the moon" and "falling knife" type events with an alarm to alert you when it's happening.

This is probably due to rising popularity among all the Prince's in the region of Nigeria.  It finally solves that problem of transferring money across regions that they are always emailing people for help with.
