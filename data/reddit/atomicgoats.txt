On the retail side, if I buy 1 BTC at the current (at the time of purchase) price of $8k, it will take 5 days for that BTC to be available for you to move or use, but the price taken from your account will be $8k+fees even if the price of BTC is over $10k 5 days later.

If you're earning bitcoin in some way, that technically is business income and you're life will be easier with a business account that's expected to have a revenue stream because you will continue to trigger account inspections, especially if you're getting a similar amount into the account on a routine basis.  If it's something simple, like someone is paying off a debt, then write up the debt and provide them with a copy of the obligation for their files.  They just need to make sure that you're not using their services to participate in illegal activities.

Fun fact.  If you're in the US and the company owns the computer, they will also be the rightful owners of any bitcoin earned and so you could be one of the first people to not only get fired, but get a bill for the value of the bitcoin earned on any connected account.  Don't worry, they can easily see what you're connected to at the network operations center, so you won't have to bother letting them know.

No one seems to have posted this, but USAA has been invested in Coinbase for a several years now.  They are a safe bet for buying/selling crypto, at least to/from Coinbase.

I agree that BTC's strength is its pedigree.  But, LTC is an alt that will also stick for the same reason. It has a solid foundation.
Other alts may gain larger market caps because their blockchain issue unlimited quantities.  So, I'm not too concerned about market caps because eventually people will realize why those unlimited coins are not useful as a store of value and are really just tokens.

There's the problem, all you do is spend through paypal. Try allowing people to pay you for products or services through them and you'll have a different point of view.
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:32:17
Way back when I set up with paypal, it took days for to get the bank connected, but
(a) I'm not going to pay a 3% tax based on transaction amounts + a transaction fee. They can just fuck right off. I've refused work because the client wanted to pay by paypal. It costs the same processing power to handle a $5 vs a $5000 transaction. So, once you get above $20 transfers, paypal is insanely expensive. You may as well just start taking credit cards because you'd have much better protection from getting fucked.
(b) Paypal did freeze my account because I was using it to receive funds from someone paying with green dot cards and then transferring those funds to my own account. I guess, in their eyes, that makes me a drug trafficker. (And, this wasn't huge sums, so I'm not only selling drugs, but I'm shit at it). I don't like a company that can willy nilly decide to FREEZE my funds w/out warning based on THEIR assumptions then take weeks to admit that I'm not a drug trafficker.
So, to push my clients into bitcoin, I give a discount for payment by bitcoin or require wire transfer into my bank account where they pay the fees. They usually go for the bitcoin route. And, once they see how quick it is, they have no problems with using. 
I just got paid at around 7:00a this morning for a job, and by 8:00a, a couple USD$100 of it was already at newegg... so, I am very happy with bitcoin, no waiting for my bank to say... well the money's here, but we have up to 10 business days to make it available in your account. That's fucking bull shit!

They didn't pull your information out of thin air.
You created an account and, by doing so, created an association with them.  They have established data retention policies that are based on compliance with regulatory requirements.  They are obligated to follow those data retention policies as approved by their board of directors.  IF they were to just randomly delete records based on something other than the approved policies, it makes their policies moot and that will go against them in any court proceedings.
They're not making your information publicly available on any search engines.  Your account has been deactivated and will likely be migrated offline at some point to eventually be deleted.

I appreciate your response and I fully understand that it isn't a technology issue. US banks are required to have x amount of capital and they do it by floating customer money as uncomitted for about 7 days at a time, during which they are certainly collecting the interest on the loans made on the basis of their capital reserves.  So, we're on the same page there.

It wouldn't surprise me if the CIA/NSA cried when he went under because they'll probably never again have such an easy vantage point to trace down transactions. From reading about how he ran that shop, it wouldn't surprise me if the CIA/NSA had their own server in there set up out in the open.

All payment processors get a cut of the payments they process. That's why you don't see a payment processing fee tacked on, yet people still take credit cards. One processor that I worked with got $0.01/transaction + a set percentage and those pennies added up, so it was worth their effort to act as a payment processor.  BUT, paying these processors also ensures that fees will never go down for the merchant who pays them in the end.

SARs don't get you into trouble.  But, you're better off avoiding what looks like structuring (multiple small transfers) unless you're doing it at a set timing so you can claim it was a buying strategy.  If you've moved small amounts and they've gone through, then larger amounts should be no different.  But, I have to say that I'm not with PNC Bank so cannot speak from first hand experience.  If you're concerned, call your bank and tell them that you're going to make the transfer and ask them if it's going to give them heart burn.  If they say yes, then I'd close the account anyway.  Coinbase is a fully accredited institution that even provides fiduciary services for Wall Street. It is no where near a concerning type of organization.

I hate seeing anonymity being promoted in relation to bitcoin.  That's not actually true because the vast majority of the on/off ramps are through regulated financial institutions and all transactions are publicly available.  The only true anonymity is in coins that you have mined for yourself.  There are already automated services to trace-back coins and identify them to known addresses.  That's how exchanges can dump people using gambling sites that might risk their regulatory compliance status. Government agencies are certainly pumping funds into further development to speed triangulation services (by paying insane licensing/subscription fees for the services), so their resolution will only improve over time.
I would like to see people start talking about AUTONOMY in that when the financial institutions tried to shut out Wikileaks, bitcoin was the solution. Autonomy allows you to go off the grid if you want to (or need to).  When enough people go autonomous, eventually a higher level of anonymity will return.

You're confusing several things.
(a) The blockchain is a record of transactions.  All transactions send x-value of bitcoin FROM an address (wallet) TO an address (wallet).  If the sending wallet has the correct private key to send the x-value of coin, then the miners include the transaction (logged/verified) into a block on the blockchain.  All transactions (once mined) are valid.
(b) Bitcoin is moved by transactions (see above).  So, if Joe wants to take Mary's bitcoin then he needs to do ONE of the following:
(Option b.1) Get Mary to send the bitcoin to an address that Joe controls.  Transactions are not reversible, so once the coin is sent to his address, then he functionally owns them.  Mary may not get what she was expecting or may not have intended to send to that address or... &lt;insert other failures here&gt;, but Joe now has control of (and in the blockchain's view, ownership of) the bitcoin. If Mary is not happy with that situation, it's a matter for either civil or criminal courts.
(Option b.2) Joe can gain access to Mary's wallet application (and as a result, Mary's private keys for the bitcoin addresses in it).  This can be by any number of exploits from social engineering (Mary, can I borrow your phone for a while?) to technical exploits (Mary hates virus scanners and never runs them so has a completely infested computer!)  In this case, Joe can send the transactions to move the coins to his own address any time he wants because he has access to her private keys.  Again, the blockchain sees the transaction as valid and processes it.  If Mary is not happy about it, then it's a matter for her IT team and/or the courts.
So, the way to prevent stolen bitcoins is to be an intelligent users.  Don't fall for scams like websites that promise insane returns or too-good-to-be-true deals.  Manage your tech security on phones, computers, etc, etc as if your wealth depended on it, because it does.  Don't click strange links, especially those using URL shortening services.

This was a vote to stop fractional banking... as in, to ban banks from lending 9x (number picked at random) the amount they have on hand (fractional reserve).  Fractional banking is how the money supply is expanded.  
When you put $100 into a bank account, banks can say "Hey, I have $100 cash, who wants a loan?" and lend out $90 of that $100.  They then collect interest on those loans as they are paid back. The banks count on the fact that not everyone will ask for all their money back at once.  You've essentially given them a free loan of your money, if not paid for the privilege through banking fees.
The vote was to ban that practice making banks more like bitcoin where fractional reserve bankings isn't possible... you can only expand bitcoin supplies by mining bitcoin.
To give you an idea of how much money is created by fractional reserves... in the above example, that would be a leverage of 9:1 ...they can lend (make) $9 for every $1 they actually hold.  In the Wall Street melt down (and still to this day) some Wall Street products were leveraged 35:1.

UM... this is in-band billing for electricity.  Power companies have been trying to find a profitable way to ride network traffic over their existing power lines for a long time, hoping to become a last mile provider because everyone has hard wired electricity.  (They basically layer the data signal over the power transmission). This is the inband billing for that system so that end devices are able to be pay-as-you-go.  It's interesting, but the "Powered by Bitcoin" is better described as an automated payment system.  There is already in-band power management on most grid connected systems at this point, so this isn't really as speshul as it sounds except that Walmart is not a usual player in this industry.  I'm guessing that they're hoping to license it back to power producers in exchange for near zero cost power (coolers in all those stores cost a hell of a lot to run!)

ATM operators face over $100k in legal and compliance fees to even place a single ATM into operations.  Many states require a substantial bond.  Many locations get a cut of the "fees" collected.  The operator has to either pay a service fee for the tech backend or maintain their own tech support.  And, the operator wants to make a profit when they are buying/selling their bitcoin on the same exchanges as everyone else.
So, yes, you are going to pay more at an ATM machine.  That's the cost of being able to walk up to it in a store and only provide minimal ID (if your amounts are low enough).

Japan has VERY limited interest returns on savings and has been moving to implement bitcoin in retail and other daily use cases.  Japan is the third largest economy behind the US and China.  (Consider how TINY Japan is to do that!  The US has 325 million people, China has 1.4 billion, and Japan only has 127 million.)
NOW... if Japan becomes the largest holder of BTC and BTC goes to 10x its current price... consider what that will do for the country's economy.  Consider if BTC goes to 100x the price ($750k/BTC).
Japan is the host of the 2020 Olympics... it would make sense for them to push their BTC retail into the games themselves.  No international exchange rates required, massive adoption opportunity, and the secondary effect is to increase the Japanese economic power in relation to fiat.

Last Dec's media attention was about at the "Why would I use email when a fax is quicker" level of hype.  Bitcoin as a technology is also right around the 1995 era. Cell phones were large bricks w/corded handsets, email was still mostly contained to universities and a few businesses, we had fundamental technologies, but not the robust user interfaces.
Keys in bitcoin is that the 2nd layer technologies are being developed and coming online now (lightning networks, atomic swaps, etc).  Business use cases are being addressed, such as the crude oil market that's been stood up (looking to gain asian markets from the petro-dollar), cashless societies (S.Korea has 2020 target date), retail sales (Japan is leading the way there).  So, it is actually good that bitcoin is fading from the public view for now to take pressure off the mining network while these use cases are worked out.  The next halvening is 2020 and will coincide w/Japan hosting the Olympics and S.Korea's outcome of going cashless (prob first country to do such a thing if they do it).  
There will be plenty of new "hype" in 2020.  We don't need to keep shoving it in people's faces while it's still growing stronger legs.

There have been times when buy orders could not be filled. I think Australia and India both ended up with exchange limits because their exchanges could not source enough BTC to supply demand in the last price run up.
The US Dollar is not unlimited, I wouldn't call it finite, but it is close to the scenario that you describe (new available only when set rules are met), yet there has never been a case of dollar hording that would rise to the level you describe, so I would say that you're asking about a scenario with very low odds of happening.
IF it happened and were short term, then the price would see a premium until some were willing to sell.  If it persisted and none were willing to sell, then it would no longer have value since the network would be in a state of collapse (no participants).

It's a prefunded channel.  So, you commit your BTC to a lightning channel and, because it's already in the channel, you can use it instantly.  Say you put $50 on a channel.  You can make 10 $5 purchases for just the single $50 BTC move to the channel. IF you decide you want your BTC back in your local wallet, then you just close out and recover the BTC back to your local wallet.
Using lightning (a second layer solution) will move a lot of small transactions off of the primary bitcoin network.  This is not entirely different from how an exchange does off network transactions to service their clients (they move the BTC between accounts w/out issuing an on BTC network transaction).

I think in the future, it BTC growth will be able to be studied (along with IP as an older example) to understand the adoption of technologies into carbon-based society.  The spikes are interest, then the interest exceeds the capacity of the technology and it ebs again to build that capacity with more people applying their skills to the technology.  Then, the continued societal work on the technology builds interest until it spikes again.
IP was original a way to ftp files around, then message boards and email, then .., then...   -- The chilling cycles are in security, even Russia at one point bought out manual type writers to combat what they viewed as security flaws of networked information. But, we went through sneaker nets (physically separate networks) at the physical layer, then firewalls at the routing level, now security is to the application layer.
So, I do believe that the spike this time will go until bitcoin exceeds the technical capacity of BTC  + Lightning networks.

This article makes a mistake in predicting that the altcoin values will come later based on the need for bitcoin to buy them.  Bitcoin has been decoupled from many altcoins that can now be purchased directly or through ETH.  So, where traditionally there were only ALTCOIN/BTC pairs (and as BTC value rose, the pair value rose)... there are now other markets/pairs available.  So, I would NOT go buying altcoins if you still believe that a rise in BTC value will pull up all other altcoin values.

I think that BTC wants to hover in the $6k range (6000-6999 = sub $7k) and will occasionally for BRIEF periods dip below that (5000-5999 = sub $6k).  I think this pattern will try to happen through the first half of 2019, so, until this time next year.

I looked into this recently and my takeaway was that you can set a fee demand to use your node, but many (most?) nodes have zero or next to zero fees.  In general, you might ... MIGHT! ... be able to make a penny for a transaction, but typically your node will be bypassed for a free or cheaper one.  The alternative is that you fund your node to handle LARGE transactions (that most nodes can't handle) and attempt to charge a fee that way, but typically large transactions are going to be made over the Bitcoin network and not on the LN.  So, for now, until the newness and willingness to run free nodes wears off, there is not really any money to be made.  Even once it wears off, the money will be extremely limited and a commodity basis (you'd have to fund enough to be able to really scale up to make any reasonable return).

That article is sort of an example of "motivated reasoning" and the point was to push the narrative that bitcoin is for criminals.
He talks about bitcoin volatility but the article was about a period in time where bitcoin is the primary currency.  At that level of adoption, there will not be 10% swings because of the sheer number of people using it and the velocity of its use in everyday transactions.
He talks about stimulus and other debt based incentives, but ignores that early bitcoin adopters seem to be getting out of the debt cycle all together.  The current system relies heavily on leveraging consumer's willingness to take on debt.  I think that train has left the station and future generations are not going to be as happy to take on debt. They're trending toward being an "experience" generation vs an "accumulation of material items" generation.  New forms of promises of payments will likely emerge to address high dollar requirements for individuals and businesses.  
The biggest thing he ignores is that the current system of leveraging up to 1:35 done in dollars will likely be unwound from the source.  When people no longer want to hold dollars in bank accounts, they will no longer have anything to leverage off of.  When early bitcoin adopters use their gains to pay off their student loans, pay off mortgages early and pay cash for cars... the banks, again, have fewer products to package into their casino system.
We have no way to predict how an GLOBAL economy not heavily reliant on debt would operate at this point.  So, no way to predict how economic incentives SHOULD or COULD work.  The author is making huge leaps and assumptions in the article that ignore significant factors that COULD or WOULD happen to achieve bitcoin as the primary currency.

In the US, businesses who use bitcoin are still regulated. Even crypto-currency itself is regulated. Don't confused being disgusted with the banking system and the Fed (not the government!) with giving up your power to control who is driving those regulations. 
It benefits bitcoin to have politicians who are NOT bought-and-paid-for by Wall Street. Sanders is running without any SuperPACs at all... Clinton's SuperPAC is mostly funded by Wall Street.

To me, LN is closer to pre-paid debit cards than credit cards.  And, there's nothing wrong with providing a new approach to already identified use cases.  Eventually, Citibank may end up running LN nodes as part of their service.  But, the difference between running a LN node and starting from scratch for a new altcoin is that bitcoin has a global network running for "free" to secure those transactions.  Do you think a Citibank is going to invest in a global infrastructure AND run it at cost, AND that will ALWAYS be less secure than what they could have had from the Bitcoin network? 
They have a  captive "retailer market" and can easily just convert them for a "small fee" by upgrading their existing fielded hardware.
