Hi, it could be something else that has the same magic bytes, but I doubt it and I'd say it's worth investigating.
Here's some more info in case others are finding this later.
Write down the sector and block and other numbers you find (easier to get back later).
Then get yourself [HxD]( or some other hex editor, run as admin, go Extras-&gt;Open Disk-&gt;Select disk and jump to the sector you found with DiskInv.
Now try to search one of these magic bytes to see if it is in fact a wallet. A wallet should contain these bytes:
    01 0A 64 65 66 61 75 6C 74 6B 65 79
and these:
    01 09 62 65 73 74 62 6C 6F 63 6B
You can also use HxD to search the disk, I just found DiskInv to be faster last time I tried.
In order to restore the wallet you can try a program or you can manually copy the hex values from start to end to make a new file. I made a test wallet and it starts with:
    00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 62 31 05 00
and ends with the fourth occurence of:
    B1 81 E8 C3 4E B5 09 83 9D 64 FD 43 E8 00 00 00
Feel free to pm me.

Here's a free way to check if the wallet data exists on the drive.
1. Get [DiskInv](
2. Run as administrator
3. Do a Disk search (with the hex bytes option checked) for this: 076b65796d657461
That will do a raw data search on the whole disk for a special combination of bytes, which are found in the wallet.
If this gives results, the wallet data is somewhere on the disk and can probably be restored with a restore program, or restored manually from the disk sector with some help.

The hex-search is to identify the actual wallet file (wallet.dat), did you check the "hex bytes" before searching? I forgot to mention that.
Anyway, I see now that you're talking about a text file containing the private keys. To find that file, you would have to search for something in that file.
If your address was written in the same file, you could do a text search for the address (not using hex bytes), or anything else that might be in the file for that matter.
As others said; you should not use the same disk as the file was on, because your operating system will continue to overwrite free space (where your file actually might be). Get another disk with an operating system up and running, and then search the original disk from the new one.
Futhermore, you should run a restore program (from another disk) anyway, it might turn up with the whole file. EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard comes to mind, but try multiple. I'm sure you're able to fetch a good copy from a certain Bay, if you're broke.
If you know where the file was, that could maybe help as well.
Additionally, there are some white hat hackers who offer to try and crack the private key if you have the address, in return for some % of the findings. But it's almost impossible without knowing anything about the private key.
Let me know how it goes!

It looks like you're right, they're files used by an older byteball wallet/application. I'm not too familiar with byteball but it seems like keys and other goodies are stored [somewhere else]( than the application, so those files won't do you any good by themselves.
Of course, if you had a lot of byteballs, it might be worth looking into the older wallet if it worked differently.
