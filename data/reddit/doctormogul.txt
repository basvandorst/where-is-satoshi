Ok, then why an Email with comfirmation of withdraw from the morning of the hack says this:
"Withdrawal processing time:
Bitcoin (bitgo enabled account): Processed within 1 minute after approval, subject to spending limits of the account. Processed within 12 hours maximum.
Bitcoin (non-bitgo account): Processed within 1 minute after approval, subject to "hot wallet" available balance. Processed within 12 hours maximum."
Thx 4 your time.

What timezone's night?

And after this, assuming there could be an up to 12 hours waiting time, the withdraw didn't happen and six hours later the site was taken down and all we know that followed that @_date: 2016-08-05 17:48:43
This a great idea indeed. We're so tired of waiting. Thanks to both!

Ok, but the funds were not in a BitGo wallet because the withdraw wasn't "Processed within 1 minute after approval". This was like 6 hours before Bitfinex site was taken down. 
The funds were already stolen?

It could mean the saving of Bitfinex AND StartJoin at the same time (lol).

Ah, ok. I got it wrong then. We'll be waiting for the update tonight. Thanks and good luck.

I had a withdraw approbed like 6 hours before the site went down, never got the funds. These are probably gone too?
