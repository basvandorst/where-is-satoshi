Out of curiosity, what proof would satisfy you?

I made a throwaway for this specific problem, but am willing to confirm it from my usual username if people really want to look that hard for reasons to discredit me. Silly me for thinking that users here were fellow bitcoiners and not Blockchain.info lawyers.

I was in a rush to post this and was extremely worried. Let me clarify. That link is the address that my bitcoins came *from*. [This is my address]( And [this is the address]( my bitcoins were sent to.

Apparently, they don't refund money unless the hacker returns it (such as in Johoe's case). Jade from Blockchain.info support never believed or listened to me for a second. To be honest, I'm ready to cut my losses and just sell all of my bitcoins. If someone who took this many security precautions can lose $900 in bitcoins five minutes after buying them, I don't have any faith that this can take off.
My Wells Fargo account has not been immune to the same kind of people that did this, with multiple security breaches and fraud disputes, yet somehow I have managed to not lose a penny in the process. I can't believe people are actually talking about bringing bitcoin to developing countries, where losing $900 can destroy lives (as opposed to my single bad day).
There's just more harm than good here, and it took being a victim of theft of almost a thousand dollars to see that. Plus, the community that made bitcoin so groundbreaking and important more than 2 years ago has been completely overshadowed by hoarders and shills. I can see the moon reflecting off their glazed eyes. Just looking at the front page here, it's so obvious now.

Address or wallet? If you mean address, I create new ones all the time (ironically, for security reasons).

No. It was a big mistake, but one that I made because I don't usually keep my coins in Blockchain.info for more than a few minutes. Lesson learned, but I'm not willing to go as far as to say that it removes any responsibility from Blockchain.info in this circumstance.

Yup, $900 for me, which is a lot of money in my current situation. This was back in December, when a lot of other people were having issues with Blockchain.info's address generation. 
The person who has my coins is doing [pretty well]( now. Strangely, they never transferred any coins out, which makes me even further suspicious that this is a Blockchain.info issue that they aren't aware of.

Same thing happened to me a month ago, but only a few people here believed me. Honestly, this is the wrong place to post negative things about Blockchain.info.
I ended up getting out of bitcoin completely and cutting my losses. Even though 2-FA might have helped prevent my situation, there is always going to be another vulnerability. Just look at the top comment here for evidence of this.
