Yes, a matrix

2017 was full of altcoins and a winter bull run...
@_date: 2018-08-23 04:52:27
If there’s nobody on the other side of the bet, there is no bet.
If bitcoin will succeed it will be in all aspects and against all odds. Thats’s a true winner.
Don’t pray for an easier task, pray for more endurance

A lot of allegations made with only a few graphics as explanation
@_date: 2018-08-21 05:11:34
commingle (verb): to mix; blend
Rehypothecation is the practice by banks and brokers of using, for their own purposes, assets that have been posted as collateral by their clients. Clients who permit rehypothecation of their collateral may be compensated either through a lower cost of borrowing or a rebate on fees.

True. 2011 was still a long way from any kind of meaningful adoption though. The trend started afterwards (about 2013) imo.
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:54:32
Thanks, hadn’t read that!
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:07:48
You are trying hard not to understand. If your mother holds your 10$ does she own it too? I guess...let’s stop being overly philosophical about it and stoart asking some real questions
@_date: 2017-02-21 12:32:35
There's no one good way to combat ignorance. Try waiting until they have a question or show interest and then show them a youtube video of Andreas Antonopoulos talking about bitcoin. His zeal always gives me optimism
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:58:16
Bitcoin is my plan B. Plan A is my job.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:46:00
A plateau
@_date: 2017-02-09 12:00:14
It is reddicalised, permissionfull, mutatable and definitely commentable
@_date: 2017-02-25 12:24:58
@_date: 2017-02-22 10:00:31
What about users not listening to their devs? That's a compromising move too
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:57:09
How big is the full blockchain? I only have a 128 gigs SD card
@_date: 2017-02-16 06:15:11
Wouldn't it auto-deny it if they don't decide?
@_date: 2017-02-16 06:56:37
I thank you for your input. It is valuable to me
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:25:07
I don't think Vinny is selfish with his advice for the market and people. Yes, he stands to gain from a price drop but so does almost everyone else.
If the price drops, it would be our way of reminding the miners they're not alone and their own interest is not the only one to protect. According to his advice/prediction!the market would indeed be shuttered and a decision, a more final decision to the scaling debate would emerge shortly after, and the price would bounce back upwards.
By already having sold his coins he is actually following up on his own prediction and being true to his word and interest.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:21:03
Yep. You got me :) i just fired up the pi and dealt with the upside down touchscreen and inverted mouse coordinates and wifi connectivity problems... *gasps*
now for the Node..

@_date: 2017-03-16 00:16:13
I know. That's not the question or the point
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:10:30
It is known
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:18:52
And you are what, a bitcoin romantic? A bitcoin dreamer? This isn't fuckin fiat where grandma gets her pension regardless of the currency price. It's an investment, a market. Everybody is trying to get rich. He who says he's not is lying. That's why we need to align our interests. Or maybe the miners are allowed  to get rich no questions asked because "they invested so much in the hardware"?!
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:28:52
Theymos clearly stated he will not tolerate talk about altcoin on the bitcoin subreddit.

We need more idealists like you! It would be nice if the hacker was one
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:22:32
Sure hope so. I would if i were him. At lest to mitigate the damage Ver would do by dumping his coins on Core
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:29:21
It's worth exactly 1 Bitcoin
Next question: how long is a meter? Without feet or inches or yards or miles...

Do you have proof for those allegations? I am genuinely, curiously asking
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:13:14
So come on and let me knooooow,
Should i sell or should i go!?
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:39:55
I like your input. We need somebody to keep an eye on the chinese market. Pls don't go!
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:12:59
Somebody's gettin' rich
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:32:09
Very insightful
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:23:26
The answer is yes
@_date: 2017-01-23 19:12:14
Demonstrate AND prove? Oh aren't we lucky then
@_date: 2017-01-10 18:54:13
Don't i pay more fees when having more transactions?

Sooo do you have a tinfoil hat or you just coated a regular hat with tinfoil within? If so, what hat did you use?
@_date: 2017-01-17 21:23:01
Do people really believe in these projections? I thought after all those years maybe we learned to not get our hopes up in vain
@_date: 2017-01-17 12:56:13
No homo
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:03:05
I'm doin' it.. it's a rollercoaster but i like the ride. The distant future looks promising and the near future is not at all boring. You get aquainted with a lot of financial parameters/instruments so i guess you also learn a lot. The community is friendly and generous, don't know how reliable it is, but you have an abundance of information sources so it's really up to you. I'll go on a limb here and say welcome to the hodling team!
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:34:03
No problem, spread it around with a smile
@_date: 2017-01-14 01:27:53
Yeah but like 99% will be mined by 2040, right? So we'll kinda see the deflationary effect in our lifetime. Correct me if i'm wrong pls
@_date: 2017-01-12 15:44:12
So close no matter how faaaaar..
@_date: 2017-01-16 01:18:51
I project a period of great stagnation. I believe we have reached enough media attention to attract bad press, regulation measures from governments and a general feeling of uncertainty. Hope it's just me
Edit: i mean that pricewise. The technology (segwit, LN, etc.) continues to develop at a rapid pace wich gets my hopes up.
Science is cool because it works wether you  believe in it or not.
Patience is a virtue our generation must learn.
@_date: 2016-12-24 23:38:15
Luckily bitcoin rises as we comment
@_date: 2017-01-17 21:20:24
Damn you and you well formed arguments! What are your more hopeful thoughts? What alternatives do you see?
@_date: 2018-06-22 07:56:59
You really love the enter button, don’t you

I believe you should ask yourself if you would buy gold. Gold was discovered a long time ago, always went up. Do you see people saying "i should've bought gold 100 years ago?" No! Because it's not about how much gold you have now, it's about how much value can you get when gold/bitcoin rises. The rise gives you value. Will it rise? Is a wiser question imo. And we all know the sentiment to that
@_date: 2019-02-12 09:33:40
Then why is there a spike in upload at the beginning ofcthe graphic, when he synchronised the blockchain?
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:22:27
Is this like e-bay kleineinzeigen but with crypto? That would be awesome!
@_date: 2019-02-27 06:19:22
Awesome. It does seem like a good application as most of the kleinanzeigen-transactions are settled in cash

the half-retorical question in the title was actually a segue for question in the post.

At least...how much do you think one would need nowadays to move the price like that?
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:25:56
Wow, my first ever tip!
I raise my hat to you, good sir/madam
@_date: 2019-01-25 10:14:57
Bureaurats talking about rat poison... circle jerk much..?
@_date: 2019-01-25 23:23:34
The price has been under that line in the past so i don’t see where you’re coming from..
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:53:18
What bogus hype? Ist it not the most immutable, international, censorship resistant means of transfering money you’ve ever seen? And you’ve seen nothing yet..
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:55:58
Your money did not go poof from the hype. You invested because of the hype
