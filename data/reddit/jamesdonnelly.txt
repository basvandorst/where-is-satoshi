If you'd invested €7 per day for the last 365 days, your €2,555 investment would now be valued at €16,200.32.

Hey guys, I made this following a thread I submitted 10 days ago about how much money you'd now have if you'd invested $10 into Bitcoin every day for the past 365 days.
This is an online calculator which allows you to specify Daily, Weekly, Fortnightly or Monthly investments in either USD, EUR or GBP. It works out how many bitcoins you could have now had and what their value would now be compared to the cost of investment.
Here's a screenshot for those of you who don't want to visit the page: 
Enjoy. :)

If you're planning on just holding the Bitcoin I don't think any of them really matter. You don't need to know  or  if your exchange has an easy GUI (or you just keep them on the exchange anyway, as most newcomers will).  doesn't matter at all.

Storing your bitcoins on Coinbase, or any other online wallet for that matter, means that *you* are not in control of your bitcoins. This isn't an argument specifically against Coinbase, it's an argument against using wallets which you don't have ultimate control over.

If I had 1BTC prior to the fork, and still have 1BTC after the fork, do I also have 1BCH? Is this the same as my 1BTC, but with far less face value, or is this a separate entity to my 1BTC, meaning I'm now slightly better off somehow?
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:09:27
Only because I'm exactly 0.0015BTC away from a round number.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:33:20
Of course, I'm not going to unbox these. Where's the fun in receiving an already-opened box anyway?
I'm planning on transferring some funds into a web wallet and giving them access to that, then using that to teach them how to send funds over into their new hardware wallets.

For the same time period between 2015 and 2016 you'd have spent $3,650 on a total of 7.24 Bitcoins, but your investment would have only been worth $5,416.
Had you held on to those Bitcoins as well, your 2015 to 2016 investment would now be worth $58,948.

All? Only Coinbase and Gemini were down, and both had tweeted about problems they were having in advance.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:58
I used blockchain.info as my Bitcoin wallet between 2013 and 2016 before moving over to a hardware wallet. Didn't have any issues. I'm in the UK and I still use my wallet there to buy Bitcoin as it's got one of the better rates.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:26:40
 gives a load of information about what they are, and here's a YouTube video about how they can be configured and used: 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:17
Also: check Twitter. Coinbase announced they were having difficulties earlier, as did Gemini, long before either went offline. The mad rush of panicked sellers can't have made the issues they were having any less of a problem.

Can't do all that much with the address.

May I ask when blockchain.info was hacked? I know about the whole domain hijacking thing from earlier this year, but from what I remember that was due to their DNS provider being compromised, not them actually being hacked.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:02:24
I used to run on this logic as well, but I stopped doing this earlier this year. I used to dump some of my savings into Bitcoin every month but withdraw the amount I'd put in every time its value doubled, making my Bitcoin completely independent of any other currency. When Bitcoin hit £3000 earlier this year though, I realised that I'd have been significantly better off had I not done this. Right now this is my number one regret with Bitcoin.
To put it into some perspective, my initial investment was for 1BTC back in 2014. In 2016 I sold around 0.4BTC to get my initial investment back. Lo and behold, fast forward to November 2017 and that 0.4BTC sitting in someone else's wallet is now worth £2,900 - well over 10x my initial investment.
If you're serious about holding and want my advice: only cash out if you couldn't afford to lose it or if you desperately need the fiat money. If Bitcoin were to drop to £0 over night, would you be okay financially? If not, you should really consider withdrawing some so as not to be putting all your eggs in one basket. Otherwise, as a holder, there's no real reason for you to withdraw.

Cool. What's the address?

In exactly 1 year Bitcoin's price has increased from a high of $734.43 to where we are at $10,000 today. That's a yearly increase of 1361.6%.
If you'd bought $10 worth of Bitcoin on the 29th of November 2016 and held on to it, it'd now be worth $136.
If Bitcoin is to increase by the same amount for the next year, on the 28th of November 2018 Bitcoin's price will be $136,160.
It's going to be very interesting to see what happens next.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:04:49
For Bitcoin: a small amount of hysteria is making people sell their coins, pushing the price down.
For all other currencies: the lowered Bitcoin price is driving people to exchange their other currencies for Bitcoin.

Correction? It's only down 4.52% compared to what it started the day on.

I definitely agree, however Bitcoin has had a huge publicity boost in the last week. I'm impressed this didn't happen over the weekend.

24 hours ago we were on $9,688. We're now on $9,507. That itself is only a ~1.8% drop. It's no big deal, believe me.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:45:40
The same can be said for the linked article. Bitcoin's current value is 60% lower than it was 100 days ago, however Bitcoin's current value is 15% higher than it was 50 days ago. It's 30% lower than it was 75 days ago, but it's 30% higher than it was 125 days ago.
As a disclaimer, my percentages here are rough estimates based on a Bitcoin price chart.
