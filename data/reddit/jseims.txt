You should reach out to us at trustedcoin.com.
We offer APIs building multisig services, where we have 1 of the 3 keys.  We can enforce whatever signing policies you want (i.e., "is the payee a known payee, is this amount within limits etc").
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:30:36
The idea is you would *not* store the two keys on the same device.
If both of your devices are compromised (and compromised by the same entity capable of reassembling the two keys), then you're at risk.
You also still need to trust whichever client you're using to generate keys (which is true for all wallets).
I would be delighted if other wallet developers (who may have more trusted names) were to leverage the TrustedCoin APIs to add this security layer to their own wallets.

We use twilio to send SMS notifications (see  for more details).
@_date: 2014-03-04 05:03:28
We recommend that you generate the keys on 2 different devices.  And write the 12-word mnemonics on paper.
Only enter one of the 12-word mnemonics on one computer.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:04:05
That's a good idea.
It's easy to trust the APIs, since you can observe that no private keys are sent.  But you still have to trust whoever writes the wallet client.
I hope other wallet developers integrate with out APIs.

Our approach still offers a lot of protection even for the cases you mention.
* Monitoring the whole email process and emulating it if it is done on the computer -- a rooted machine could erase the notification email, but not the SMS.
* Perform in memory modifications of the target wallet in a transaction -- true, but you can check the address in the notification SMS.
* Redirect validation requests to a local proxy so the wallet owner never knows -- no, because the malware would need to know a second private key to correctly sign the transaction.
That said, if you're the target of a focused, individual attack, you need to consider attack vectors outside our scope (such as both key-generating devices being compromised).
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:13:46
Yes, that's possible and is one reason why web wallets are not as secure as native applications.
The main motivation behind creating this wallet was to demonstrate how easy it is to integrate any wallet with TrustedCoin APIs.
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:35:27
The user retains 2 keys for a 2-of-3 multisig address, so he can always move funds unilaterally.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:01:11
You should take a look at [TrustedCoin](
Our APIs make using multisig a lot easier.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:11:44
The constraint is that n of m addresses are considered non-standard if m &gt; 3, in which case transactions won't get propagated through the network.
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:36:55
The backend APIs allow for customizing this time delay, but for simplicity I hardcoded to 24 hours in the web wallet implementation.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:05:33
Correct (unless you use the unilateral send function with your two keys).
The security comes from TrustedCoin cosigning transactions that match certain security policies.  In the case of this web wallet, the security policy is "send email/sms and wait 24 hours".
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:31:23
Correct, we delay all transactions by 24 hours, so you would want to use this wallet as you "vault", and periodically transfer funds to a more user-friendly wallet to act as your spending money.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:09:13
You *do* have to trust whoever writes the wallet client.
But our approach leaves 2 of the 3 keys in the user's hands, so you can transact without TrustedCoin.
The redeem script is needed to create transactions from Pay To Script Hash addresses (it's technical, but see  for more info).
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:54:58
That's a great idea!

If you don't trust that there's no malware on your computer, but you don't want to keep a dedicated offline computer and have to deal with transferring transactions to sign on a USB key, you can:
1) Sign up with 
2) Write your 12-word seeds on paper, and put them somewhere safe.
Then, every time you make a transaction, you get notified by email and SMS and have 24 hours to cancel.  You own 2 keys for a 2-of-3 multisig address, so you still have full control.  But a hacker can't steal your coins without either getting 2 keys (generated on two different computers), or taking over both your email and SMS notification channels.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:58:51
The web wallet handles all this for you.  Those examples show how to do it using command-line tools.
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:08:53
If you create a wallet, then click the "security" button, you'll see a web form that handles this situation.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:42:15
You can still perform a transaction with 1 key.  If you don't have your phone, you won't be able to veto the transaction through the SMS link.  But it will still go through.
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:10:51
Yeah, we'll adjust periodically.  We can't charge too much, as people can always move funds for free with both keys (though doing so obviates the security protections we've built).
@_date: 2014-03-04 03:08:53
The problem is this approach is less secure.
If the attacker has access to your email, he can immediately authorize the transaction.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:26:10
We don't do any account authentication.
So long as you have at least one of your keys, you can perform transactions.  If you lose both your keys, there's nothing we can do to help you, since we never see your keys.
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:33:45
We add a 0.0005 BTC fee to all transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:02:47
We generate keys from 12-word mnemonics, so you just have to write those down on paper.
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:41:05
The backend APIs (see  deal with partially signed transactions, so this is possible.
But the web wallet is built to work online.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:10:13
If you click on the "security" button from the wallet page, you'll see a form where you can move coins without going through TrustedCoin at all (but you need both your keys).
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:59:52
You can verify, but you have to get your hands dirty with bitcoind.
