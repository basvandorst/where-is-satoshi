Ponzi scheme OR platform lacking systemic security and redundancy. Reason I say ponzi is cause of the statement "guaranteed 1-2% annual returns". Anything along those lines just sounds like bitconnect, if this joinmarket is open sourced, decentralized, and secured by SHA-256, ETHash, Scrypt PoW or any other secured algorithm then by all means I take back my ponzi statement. I simply don't see the point of allocating millions of $ in crypto and overcomplicate the process of securing your funds by deleting and making new wallets for the chance to recieve 1-2% annually. I'd rather stick to the security of hardware wallets and trade when necessary or HODL. 1-2% guaranteed annual returns is illogical if bitcoin, ether, and litecoin are up 480%+, 800%+, and 1000%+ in gains from last year which seems promising enough, hence greed.

But thank you for elucidating on the concept of this joinmarket. I'll make time to research it further and formulate a more evidence based conclusion.

The only privacy problem a hardware wallet contains is in the case of an evil housekeeper. Someone would have to genuinely hate you a lot to format the hardware wallet, put it in recovery mode, install a modified MCU and firmware containing malware and lastly send and confirm a super specific transaction. Then you would have to send all your money to your wallet after all of this is done, which is very unlikely cause you'll notice a random transaction you never made. To top it off, you never allocate all of your funds in a localized or centralized single entry market or wallet. It sounds like you deserve it for being greedy with your "joinmarket 1-2% annual returns" ponzi scheme or platform lacking systemic security and redundancy.

Two words man, hardware wallet..
Also it wouldn't kill you to use 2FA and back up your backup codes. It's not that hard, it is a nuisance to always enter a pin code to send money or access your account but security trumps simplicity. Then store your hardware wallet, 24 word seed phrase and google authenticator or authy backup backup codes ( in a secure &amp; safe place.
