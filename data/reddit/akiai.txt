That's right, this reddit post *is* fake news. Percentage growth figures were shown right next to this graph. 160% for bitcoin and just a few % for gold.

I've been spamming this; but it's *this reddit post* with the agenda. The context of this image was about how BTC is correlating with market trends - and this graph shows it wonderfully with the correct axis.
The video where this chart also featured had growth %'s right next to it. 160% for Bitcoin and a few % for gold.
This was possibly the most pro article I've seen from the mainstream media in the last few weeks. Yet somehow Reddit was capable of agreeing that the opposite was true.

You're extrapolating your personal experience and applying it to the entire industry.
A relative handful of people mock Bitcoin. Because people here are so sensitive they upvote any anti-bitcoin sentiment so that the author can be ridiculed online. This creates noise that many people take to thinking bitcoin is under fire all the time. Actually it's not, it's the echo chamber in here that rapidly disseminates negative information that makes it seem like the world is out to get them. OP's post is the perfect example.
And sorry to hear about your personal experience offline. I enjoy trying to persuade those who doubt crypto and it usually results in a really interesting conversation.

theZerg is a really interesting character. I was listening to a podcast from Epicenter Bitcoin the other day, and what he says/is up to is downright odd.
BU have a private member's only forum where you have to apply to join. In your application, you have to anecdotally demonstrate how you support BU by linking to posts you've made in favour of it. Members can then vote on whether or not the user is allowed to join this exclusive club. What results is echo chamber 2.0.
The most absurd thing about the interview was that when theZerg was asked about how he determines what's good for the network, he said that he polls this echo chamber for their opinions. I.e. it's a rubber-stamping exercise where of course you'll be validated, and if you're not, those responsible are kicked out of the club.
It's totally unsettling that theZerg can rationalise this approach to decision making. It honestly came across as delusional. I really struggled to make it to the end of that podcast.

You're throwing that comment around quite a bit. JP Morgan, Microsoft, PWC weren't investing in ETH this time last year. Companies like Chronicled.com hadn't shown their face. Proof of Stake and Metropolis weren't on the horizon. Bitcoin's mempool wasn't as bad as it is today.
Look at the fundamentals. Right now the outlook of ETH is stronger than Bitcoin's. And this is all happening without easy access to ETH, most people need to trade it through a Bitcoin entry point.
It's an interesting stage in crypto, Bitcoin maximalists would do well to open their minds and hedge even just a little. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:01:28
The EEA isn't just a fancy name for the hype. Perhaps if you attended the summit (free and remote access) you'd have seen how Ethereum is being applied in ways never thought of before. Again, see Chronicled.
Also, you've put words in my mouth. I never said to invest in ETH at any point other than to use it as a hedge. At 500% gains you're absolutely right that a correction is coming.
I've also never said that ETH is taking the number 1 spot. Or that its cap will go to $20bn. I think you're confusing me with another user.

Look at the fundamentals. What do you see that JP Morgan, Microsoft and PWC (among others) don't? Can I point you in the direction of Chronicled.com? ETH hard forked sure, but when you look closely it becomes irrelevant. Easy to dismiss on ideological grounds. But it is undoubtedly a good alternative to Bitcoin as is Monero, LTC and a number of ERC20 coins. Pick your poison(s).

I'm not a miner, nor have I ever contributed code to Bitcoin. But I haven't ever seen any "proof" that miners are choosing to abstain, or if they are, then transparent reasons why.
At least if they had to take action, there would be more chance of open dialogue about what needs to change.

ETH is onto something. I saw Vitalik speak in London a few months ago and he is keen to create a DAO replacement of the foundation, so don't worry too much about that centralisation issue long term (if you trust VB, and personally I do).
In the meantime however, we are seeing that this leadership is swift and decisive, and Ethereum is now growing thanks to what can be best described as a "benevolent dictator".
My hunch is that we're seeing a new shift in open source business growth models. Lead the early stages and then flip into a DAO when the protocol has matured. My worry is that Bitcoin hasn't has a leader for several years, and while that's fine, the 'race' is now closing in.     
@_date: 2017-03-15 08:20:21
I think you give people too much credit. Unfortunately, some people just don't take any time to understand anything, and will blindly follow a charismatic leader with zero ability to think freely.
A lot of people think there's a conspiracy; but the most likely outcome is that we're just seeing what we see in other political landscapes. Roger Ver definitely shouts loudest, and as we've seen recently across the world, it does one hell of a job at beating facts.

Just to clarify this; the number of confirmations required to release goods or services are chosen by the receiver. There's no automation or 'option'.
Let's say you wanted to buy a t-shirt from me, and I'm super risk averse, I will only ship you the t-shirt once I've seen your transaction has received (for example) 6 confirmations. If I trusted the network, and for a low cost item, I'd probably just send at 0 or 1 confirmation.
I don't need to set anything on my side either, just a quick look at the transaction on blockchain.info will tell me whether I post your item or not.

While "mathematical problem" is technically correct, to those less interested in the technicalities it makes no sense. Here's a high level ELI5:
Imagine a Bitcoin miner rolling 100 6-side dice at the same time. The Bitcoin protocol states that it will reward this miner with a 12.5BTC payout if they're able to roll a 6 on 80 of the 100 dice. That's really difficult to do right?
Now imagine if that Bitcoin miner can roll all 100 dice thousands of times per second. And now imagine that there are thousands of miners doing this all at the same time.
It's simple probabilities as to when a miner will be successful in landing those 80 6s. And (without going into detail) the protocol adjusts to ensure that the chances of being successful takes approximately 10 minutes.
Hopefully that clarifies; I do find it odd that newcomers are given the "mathematical problem" as if miners use some kind of intelligence or AI.
It's a very clever lottery.

A shoe manufacturer implants a tamper-proof BLE ( tag that records the location of a pair of Nike trainers. At each stage in the supply chain, the trainers are tracked and the data stored in a public blockchain.
An ethical consumer can then verify (easily and conveniently) the *truth* about where those trainers came from. It will provide more transparency and will slowly force the hand of manufacturers to develop more ethical practices.
Don't get me wrong, there are clear exploits and holes in this process, but that is the idea, and many businesses are getting many millions of VC dollars to develop these ideas.
Another example is drone-based delivery. A drone could carry with it a BLE tag that allowed them secure access into your home for a delivery (as an example). The drone would pay a tiny amount of Ether (say) into a smart contract that then verified identities etc and granted access - peer to peer - ultra low cost - high potential for security. Consider elderly or disabled patients who require medicine, and the costs/inefficiencies a product like that would solve.

The vast majority of investors look to the long term. And those people only care about the 21m cap.

I wish I had made it to this lecture. I have a question for off the back of all of this.
I understand that most people in that room (and on this subreddit) own a non-insignificant amount of Bitcoin, and are primarily interested in the currency not because of the "self sovereignty" that it provides, but its rising value. News of Venezuela, India and Co's currency crisis is music to the ears of Bitcoin holders.
We are all human, why is it that anything should change once we exit the currency wars and move towards a cryptocurrency future? In fact, wealth inequality could feasibly become markedly worse should we move wholesale to Bitcoin. People will still be greedy, Bitcoin does not solve that.
I believe "programmable money" could put an end to corruption and crime in the very long term. But it could quite easily be a case of "out of the pan and into the fire" (perhaps a slightly less hot one).
What's to say that businesses and Governments are suddenly going to learn some ethics in a Bitcoin-only future?

But even then can you include missing coins in an 'aggregate value'. I'd call it 'network value' instead. However, I'm not ultra pedantic and 'Market Cap' does just fine at describing this concept.

If I understand correctly, you're saying that there is not enough energy in the Universe to find a valid private key.
I believe that also equates to the analogy I gave about a grain of sand, just another way of explaining the same thing?
Re quantum computing, my understanding is that with such a process, it is possible to attempt every possibility simultaneously. Someone with access to that tech (should it ever be possible) would be able to find millions of valid private keys very easily.
I may not be understanding this, but have done some reading around the subject of cryptography and its associated security.
@_date: 2016-12-19 22:36:03
This is exactly how misinformation spreads.
I am not a fan of Mr Ver, but if you read the article you'd see it was his CTO and not himself that made this association. It doesn't look great, but you can't stop an employee from holding their own opinion.
Also, how many people actually saw  A handful of followers? This was hardly a massively funded attack on Bitcoin.
Both sides just need to let. this. shit. go.

This type of commentary really doesn't help the debate. In one sentence you accuse the other side of spreading FUD and in the next you make unproven claims that investors are trying to crush Bitcoin. Hmm...
Of course, if you have any proof whatsoever of your claim then I'm happy to listen. Otherwise, this should be marked as what it is, FUD.

I believe the odds of this happening are in the order of dropping a grain of sand from orbit, and having another one land directly on top of it. 10 times in a row.
It is simply classified as not possible given our understanding of the universe. That is until someone makes a breakthrough with quantum computing (and then the whole world is f**ked, not just Bitcoin).

Did you stop to think that the Core developers are millionaires themselves? And that they have the backing of million dollar businesses too? I assume not given what you've just wrote.
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:08:08
Core were hostile in disconnecting BTC1. They fear losing control. I feel Core will be irrelevant in a year. Let's see.

@_date: 2017-10-06 17:35:11


You guys talk about "rushing" the 1mb to 2mb code change and forget that SegWit implementation is *far more* complex. No shit some companies haven't deployed it to their several million+ database of users in 2 months.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:14:10


This is the problem. People genuinely believe it's a hostile takeover from a "handful" of corporations in a closed door meeting. When I read this sub and Twitter every day, I have to try hard to remember that this is a particular angle on a much more nuanced decision.
The reality is that many of the most influential and important companies in this space (who have *the most* to lose from BTC failure) feel that the 1mb limit needs to be increased to allow more throughput.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:32:50
I can see that there are tx's in the mempool, and I can see that transactions take longer than they need with fees higher than they should be. It's not crushing like it was 2 months ago, but it is not good, and will only become crushing again in the next 12-24 months (when we inevitably have this god awful debate for a second time)
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:10:57

You have correctly identified the cognitive dissonance that permeates the "loud ones" on Reddit and Twitter.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:30:04
Dude, you really don't need to listen to this one guy who is now recommending you move your money??? Coinbase is a highly regulated and compliant company based in the USA which has been responsible for millions of user funds. They also have a "Vault" service built in which gives you full control over your private keys.
Please, don't let one man on a mission coerce you into moving Bitcoins to other wallets. As a new user, moving to an awkward UI wallet (which all of these downloaded ones are) can be risky in and of itself.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:16:37


Actually most crypto-idealists would very much hope that human interference is eventually wiped out. Or at least, that one group (Core or S2X) cannot sway the opinions of others through political posturing.
I have seen some of the most deceptive and downright fraudulent propaganda from Core supporters. There is undeniably a huge amount of shilling (paid or otherwise) on social media in favor of NO2X. Sadly, it is highly effective.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:10:44
Hostile and political. Shame on Bitcoin.org
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:40:09


You may be interested to know this, but fees will be *cheaper* if the blocksize increases to 2mb.

Can someone please explain lines: 75, 492, 1084, 1085 in that commit.
It seems many people here are going off of the title alone. I'm sure not everyone in here is an Bitcoin developer, in which case some context would be helpful.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:40:47
This is the type of vitriolic conspiracy nonsense I've come to expect from this sub. If you're so anti-corporation, can I recommend another coin? Bitcoin, Ethereum and others are set to change the world in every facet - from drug markets to healthcare and finance, not for fuelling (exclusively) any crypto-anarchistic ideals that you may hold.
Politics has ruined this community. I look forward to November, when it is cryptoeconomics that decides what happens, not a divisive community being fuelled by shouts of "NO2X".
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:29:44
I agree with that; but equally by placing Satoshi on a pedestal we risk devolving into a community which blindly follows the path of an (at some point) irrelevant "leader".
In the same way that political movements often reference the somewhat ambiguous vision of "the founding fathers". The masses buy-in because it sounds romantic and patriotic, but the reality is that those visions often do not take into account the reality of today. This political rhetoric can be used as a tool to further an ideal that may not be in the interests of those who support it.
I believe a lot of the debate in Bitcoin today is about power, control and a general "fuck the establishment" ideal. It is not necessarily about money, but is equally as damaging.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:26:54
When the top voted answer to your question uses terms like "hijack", "foolish" and "shady tactics", remember that you're receiving one side of the debate. It's a recruitment strategy that has sadly worked well on this sub. 
Fortunately, a significant number of companies that speak for the vast majority of users (and who understand the nuances of scaling Bitcoin to the masses) have voted for the 2mb upgrade.   
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:11:43
Source bro?
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:13:07


Self awareness tells me that Coinbase, BitPay and others know more than myself and a sprawling mass of crypto-anarchists about how best to scale the network. These two companies have some very smart people, and an executive team whose interest is entirely aligned with the success of Bitcoin.
NO2X is "anti corporation" (despite that term being pumped by a corporation named Blockstream) and anti-free-thought. It is an echo chamber of idealists who want nothing more than to stick it to the establishment. Very cliche.
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:01:08

You try banging your head against the wall for 3 years.

This needs to be higher. People just conveniently forget the facts in this sub. Core are the ones who got super hostile, BTC1 are trying to protect the network.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:43:30
Data from the loud ones. Interesting but hardly indicative.
We have millions of users on Coinbase, BitPay and others who have no appreciation or understanding of the issue. Coinbase and BitPay are lone voices that speak for their enormous pool of users.

I understand that will let cryptoeconomics play out, rather taking sides. Admirable for sure.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:20:26
I'm plenty capable of researching the impact of 1mb &gt; 2mb blocks. Sadly, the rebuttals from Core are along the lines of; "from our cold dead hands".
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:28:42
Of all the forks in the world, a 1mb to 2mb change is about as conservative as it gets. Bitterness has made it contentious; not logic and reason. Sadly.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:13:06
Good men by your definition. Some of us don't see an issue with 1mb to 2mb. Others simply scoff because "corporations".
With Bitcoin.org digging their heels in, we may see behemoths like Coinbase go further the other way. This is going to be a $70bn clusterfuck, because too many stubborn people took to Twitter and Reddit.
Despite being invested; the schadenfreude is going to be delicious. I would love to see both Core and S2X get dragged into the biggest crash in crypto's history. You all fucking deserve it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:40:49
Ah no; as a user I've wanted 2mb for a long time. Corporations play a *vital* role in Bitcoin, so I don't mind if they are able to generate agreement around a conservative upgrade from 1mb to 2mb.
A block size increase is inevitable. If not today, then in 2 years. We have a rare opportunity now, and I support those looking to seize that opportunity.


We are talking about a change in block size limit from 1mb to 2mb. Sometimes people forget that.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:23:53
*It is* an increase from 1mb to 2mb. Particularly given the low rate of SegWit adoption which I'd expect will be still be &lt;50% this time next year.
The fact is, SegWit does not a scaling problem solve. It alleviates, but Core will eventually have to admit that a conservative increase in the base block size will be necessary.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:32:06
Agree, it is also Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:47:42
That doesn't make sense. I could fork Bitcoin today and it'd have a market cap of $0. BCH has a market cap of $7bn because people are willing to pay an obscene amount for the unspendable coin.
Market cap is a very good measure of value. Success is subjective, but as a trader deciding on whether a coin is over/under valued, it's one of the best signals availbale.   
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:19:57
Surely there are plenty of other signals that Core can look at to discern a BTC1 node?
And thanks for the clarity.
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:29:22
Yep, it's not like this is a $10bn coin or anything lmao.
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:33:05
We literally have the same opinion on each other. I've been in this space for 6 years and have reviewed both sides to what is reasonably possible.
I'm happy with the opinion I've arrived at. My prediction is that Bitcoin will rally and S2X will become Bitcoin, Core will die. If I'm wrong I'll take the lessons forward.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:16:34

Likewise, people also like to claim the sky will fall if we *do* fork. I don't believe the sky will fall in either case.
If there is an issue, the issue will be forced at some point. Bitcoin isn't just disappearing overnight in any situation.
Market says there is not an issue right now.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:22:52


Because Core blocked them in the first place. You do know that right?
Regarding rushed and unstable. You may have missed it, but the fork is a change from 1mb to 2mb. Say it with me; 1mb to 2mb. There is a reason their Git hasn't had any updates in weeks.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:27:22
Dude. They are censoring nodes from connecting. It is *exactly* the type of manoeuvre that members of this sub would otherwise hate. Surely that's obvious?
Someone has come along with a proposal to improve the network; and Core chose to censor it instead of allowing the network to efficiently decide. It goes against everything Bitcoin (I thought) stands for.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:52:53
You were correct...
@_date: 2017-05-05 09:38:16

@_date: 2017-05-20 07:55:38
I appreciate the work you guys are doing, but there will be plenty of users running plenty of nodes.
This is one layer of NEM which is interesting to me. They have node reputation scores that stop low scoring nodes influencing the network. It opens another can of worms with the potential exploits for earning a higher rank, but I think it's a better direction.
