Does signing this message expose the public key?
Is moving the balance to a new address more secure,  since the new address doesn't have an exposed public key? 
@_date: 2015-12-17 04:59:18
Can you elaborate? 
Can a sender construct this message with only a receive address from the recipient?

Where does this app get its merchant data from? 
@_date: 2015-12-17 06:16:01
Apologies,  I'm still not getting it, yet .. 
Does the receiver need to generate the receive address specially,  using private key knowledge?   The sender can't generate the script? 
Edit: ... ah,  is it that the receiver's client doesn't know the script?  Does it have to be sent out of band in order for the receiver to redeem?

Wallet32 doesn't currently import xpubs for watching.  I think the only issue is that these imports wouldn't be covered by the normal backup procedure, but maybe that's ok (account names already aren't).
@_date: 2014-10-04 07:16:46
Wallet32 does 32, 39 and 44. Trezor is the same.

Yes, when you sweep a private key all funds held on that key are transferred into the deterministic keys of Wallet32.
Re: coin control - Wallet32 supports multiple "accounts", and funds are never mixed between accounts.  This isn't exactly coin control, but for many use cases it's sufficient and easier to manage.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:36:31
For the first account I use M/0'/0 for receive addresses and M/0'/1 for change.
I've been following the discussions and plan to track the consensus as it emerges.
@_date: 2014-06-07 22:39:24
BIP-0032 specifies how to implement Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets.
There are a number of security benefits, the biggest is probably that address reuse can be supported without having to continually re-backup the wallet.
Another benefit is being able to concurrently use the same wallet on multiple devices.

And myTrezor Lite for Android can import the account xpub and watch the account (and receive funds):
@_date: 2014-11-01 21:41:15
You can "pair" two wallets, and they both share the same private keys and spend the same funds.  Choose "pair" when you create the new wallet.  Another way to pair a wallet is to "restore" the new wallet using the same 12-word list.
You can also export just the XPUB for an account by selecting the account from the main screen and then choosing "Export Account XPUB" from the menu.

Sounds good.  I'll work on this ASAP.
@_date: 2014-06-09 06:28:07
For compatibility with other wallets.   Trezor,  Multibit  and other wallets are using BIP0032 and BIP0039 with 12 word (128 bit)  seeds.  It's a benefit if a wallet generated with one can be accessed on the others. 
128 random bits are plenty,  256 is overkill and twice as difficult to back up.

(Wallet32 author here) I would love to make Wallet32 Trezor-enabled, using the Trezor to protect the private keys.  Stay tuned ...

All new wallets are generated with 2048 rounds; the V0.5 support is only there to support a dozen or so legacy users.  Once we roll these wallets forward I can remove the old version.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:55:45
Yes, Wallet32 uses bitcoinj and is an SPV client.
@_date: 2014-06-08 01:15:11
I don't think this is an issue.  A single bloom filter is created which represents the entire set of addresses.  I don't think the bloom filter gets much larger as large amounts of addresses are added either.  Also, bloom filters are very fast to check potential transactions.  Bloom filters are very cool: 
@_date: 2014-06-07 19:38:58


Indeed it does.  Wallet32 wouldn't exist without the massive support that the bitcoinj code and community provide.  It's been a lot of fun working with bitcoinj!

@_date: 2014-06-08 00:35:59
Wallet32 uses the SPV protocol.  In a nutshell it provides a bloom filter to peer nodes which allows them to forward information about relevant addresses without disclosing the addresses directly.
Wallet32 uses a "horizon" of 32 addresses in each address chain.  This means that it is looking ahead at the next 32 unused addresses at all times.  When current addresses are used, new addresses are added at the end of the horizon.
Currently Wallet32 does not prune old, previously used but empty addresses from the scan and filtering.  This feature may become necessary if a large number of addresses is used.
@_date: 2015-01-12 07:30:19
When you spend the change is sent to a brand new change address.   So yes.

It's better to have your balance split amongst a number of addresses when you make multiple purchases at the same time. 
If you only have one funded address and you make a purchase you must wait for the transaction to confirm before you can make a second purchase (wait for the change to be confirmed). 
Some wallets allow spending "unconfirmed inputs" as an advanced feature,  but it is generally not allowed. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 01:31:58
A better statement is that they managed to raise the minimum fee for next block confirmation of an average transaction to $0.05 for a day.   
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:34:05

BIP44 wallets (Trezor,  Wallet32, ...) generally  support multiple "accounts"  (chains)  which are not commingled.
