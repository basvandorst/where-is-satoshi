What do you think is the ONE application or service bitcoin needs in order to become truly mainstream.

If you're in the Toronto area and you haven't bought yet: We have currently 5 agents (retail money service stores like western union, etc) that you can buy instantly in person. They are located across the GTA in major areas. We charge 3.99 percent fees and are quite a bit cheaper than the vast majority of BTMs. check us out :  and go to agent locator to find the closest location to you. If you have any questions, call us directly at 647-BIT-COIN (248-2646). Thanks!

hello sovereign curtis.  we appreciate your comments and are always willing to listen to the community.  some people will never use our services,  others have used them multiple times already!  A market with only a few options becomes a monopoly very quickly.  We offer variety and another method of transacting in bitcoin in a format that is professional, mainstream accessible and always available.  our users so far have been those people who have found it intimidating to use other types of service providers and users who want instant access to services in their local areas. if you have any comments, we are always willing to listen and respond! thanks!

We have been trying to get published on CoinDesk for weeks and no reply!  Guess a network of retail bitcoin exchanges operating out of traditional money service businesses and with rates better than bitcoin ATMs is not big enough bitcoin news nowadays? Thanks to Cointelegraph, BitcoinWarrior, TheBitcoinNews, TheCoinFront Yahoo Finance and all the other dozens of sites that published about us though! Love the support! 
CoinDesk, get on it! Cant have the community missing out on news like the Trezor release and us!

These stores already exist and have other services they offer. (western union, cheque cashing,  foreign exchange, etc.). They already pay for tellers to be there and all the overhead. SecuraCoin is free to start being offered in their stores (no hardware costs unlike BTMs) and plug into existing systems very easily. These stores make money by sharing the transaction fees which are cheaper than bitcoin atms. Since there is no hardware cost, no rental fee for the BTM to be placed there and these are existing stores, they are currently the cheapest way to buy bitcoin in person (under 4 percent) and customer friendly!

We share a 3.99 percent fee with our retail store partners. This is quite a bit cheaper than BTMs in our market charging upwards of 10 percent fees.

Contact me!  Thanks

in person instantly.

Try buying $1000 worth of bitcoin from a BTM with $20 polymer bills....  Thats 50 bills you have to stick in....  some of which wont even work. And it takes about 20 mi utes to finish....  also those BTM charge anywhere from 5 to 10 percent usually... If you're a new user wouldnt you feel comfortable buying from a person as well? Theres room for both types of offerings in the market! 
@_date: 2015-01-02 07:02:13
i would pay you 100$ for it :) 
@_date: 2014-08-24 01:08:14
find an agent near you, walk in,  walk out with cash! 
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:01:49
We agree with that statement :)
