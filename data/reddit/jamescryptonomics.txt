True :)

The whitepaper is a must, but what really turned the tides for me was watching this video with Andreas Antonopoulos . Not only does he explain the protocol well but he articulates fully on bitcoins advantages. This has not only changed my personal opinions but practically everybody else I have shown this to. I hope you enjoy :)

Lets see if the regulatory bodies get their way.... I hope not :/

It is definitely plausible.

I enjoyed learning lessons from the online poker scene. Well written article &amp; good read.

Hi all,
Firstly I would like to mention that this article was intended to be controversial. I wanted to rattle a few cages, and see what responses would be received. 
Now it would probably be beneficial if I explained more my calling for a 'united front'. Living in a country that has very stringent rules when it comes to businesses using bitcoin, the regulation side of bitcoin is an important issue to me.
I see government’s world over labeling bitcoin as they see fit, media organisations observing bitcoin with their own lens and rampant misconceptions in the eyes of the public. 
I also understand fully that bitcoins decentralized system breeds innovation and diversifies its applications. I am not calling to change this. 
I know the whole notion of sitting inside of the system sends shivers down most liberal bitcoin user’s backs (as it does mine), but I also believe that the best way to fight a system is internally, not externally. 
So to link all of the above together, I think it could be potentially beneficial if we had a universally agreed definition of what bitcoin is inside the existing system, so the media, public and governments don't make bitcoin out to be something that it is not. 
I don’t think this is in anyway a threat to bitcoins sovereignty – quite the opposite actually.  It cements bitcoin place inside of the system, whilst having no adverse effects on BTC’s ability to promote innovation and pave the way to a more unified monetary system.  
Finally, I see the relevance of peoples comparisons to Linux and the internet and because they didn’t need defining why would bitcoin. But bitcoin is set to become a world currency, and currencies need to have a universally accepted definition, even if the currency does more than that one simple definition. 
I hope this clears a few things up,
With regards,
James

The FBI? They already have 1/5th of the liability covered ;) .

That is a good point - it is hard to outline all bitcoin has to offer whilst explaining the protocol in under ten minutes though.  What I will do is make a concise list tomorrow :)

Agreed - the current situation for bitcoin related business in the UK is dire. Most banks instantly say no to any new business that mentions bitcoin.

This is exactly what I am afraid of

I couldn't actually agree more :)
