Not really, [redacted] is a clone of core with BIP101 and some other none consesus stuff.

In quantum computing the law of conservation of energy still applies.
If you had a perfectly effiecient tranistor based computer, and it took a million years to find a private key, a perfectly efficient quantum computer would still need to expend the same amount of energy to find the private key albeit in less time.
With todays computers you have to consider energy and time, but because the time frame is so large the energy use is rarley considered.
With quantum computing becuase time would be reduced the amount or energy now becomes the bottle neck.
Also as long as the public key is never used / exposed (your recieving address is a hash of of your public key) then quantum attacks would not work anyways.

Yeah that fine, but I feel like people keep ignoring that fact that miners still get to decide how big their blocks are within the upperlimit.
I don't see why we need the abillty to decrease the size. If that ever happens that means nodybody is using Bitcoin and it won't matter.

Well if that's the case and they decide to do something against the userbase, then it will be trivial to fork the code base and keep it as it is.
Great thing about how this works is that you can't force people to upgrade. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:03:32
Sorry I was assuming that with the exception of Larger blocks. That's the whole point of BIP101.
Assuming everybody wants larger blocks then upgrade.  After that upgrade if another version is commited that makes another change that people don't like which has nothing to do with blocksize then they can choose not to upgrade.

now we need to find out why? 
BIP100 is flawed in many ways.
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:50:52
More concerened about blocksize being voted down to nothing &amp; one pool holding back the size indefintely.
BIP100 is a guaranteed way to make sure blocksize stays the same.
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:18:14
My point would be that blocksize is not a consenus rule, it's a transportation metric that has been bundled into consenus and does not change the way bitcoin has been operating since the start.
The only reason a large blocksize could effect the econmics of bitcoin is because there would be no fee presure on the sytem.
But miners still have control on how large blocks are within the hardlimit. 
The real-time costs of mining and securing the network at any point in the future can be influenced by the ability of miners to impost soft limits and raise fees.

Don't care about XT, it's about BIP101. Right now XT is the only implementation that uses BIP101.
I have reviewed the differences in XT and I don't see a problem anyways.
If core implements BIP101 then I will run Core instead of XT.

Bandwidth can be limited, most bandwidth is consumed by relaying transactions, not recieveing blocks.
Plus when IBLT is implmented nodes won't have to download blocks they can construct them via the tx's in mempool they already have. IBLT header would at most be 10% of blocksize.
6 TB hard dive is about $200.
If somebody told me I could steam 4K video on my mobile 10 years ago I also would not have thought that was possible.
Most people that run nodes have an IT background and make a decent salary, this isn't suppose to be run by everybody. That's an impossible standard to set. There are lots of people that can't afford an internet connection that doesn't mean we can't have people running nodes.

No it was a feature added to stop attacks coming from TOR.
You should read up on this issue.
@_date: 2015-09-03 16:21:46
That is simply not true. Please show me the code in the git that does that?  When the node detects its behind a proxy it disables the download of the list.
Plus if you find that unacceptable that feature can be disabled. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:06:54
Wait, so your saying that BIP101 which gives no control to anybody is a plot to take control of bitcoin whereas BIP101 which give complete control to miners with the most money is going to help bitcoin be free from control?
I am genuely confused by your nonseensical statment. Please help me out and explain how BIP101 will give somebody control?
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:07:53
Then why has the core team disabled all of the feaures that allow light weight wallets to work?
