Great analysis. Psychologist Barry Schwartz calls this "The Paradox of Choice". Here's his TED talk:

I have had a similar experience, but in the reverse. (I got .0999412 or something). I assume they truncate where the penny should fall, so that fraction of a cent worth of bitcoin is just added.

I'm referring to this concept:

I'm not a hardcore bitcoin fanatic. I like Bitcoin because it gets me 3% cash back with Gyft, it's incredibly quick &amp; simple, and I have made a thousand bucks by hearing about it at the right time.
I am incredibly uncomfortable with the premise of this documentary. I'm not a revolutionary Bitcoin-zionist intent on destroying Fiat. I think that, while the monetary system leaves much to be desired, laissez-faire will lead to even more inequality and longer recessions than having a Federal Reserve will. In any case, how will people acquire mortgages or car loans without banks?
If I had not heard about Bitcoin before, this trailer would scare me. This makes Bitcoin out to be an anarchist *thing*, the users of which hope to destroy the world as we know it. Even knowing what I do about Bitcoin, this trailer scares me, because I'm not a fringe-cryptocurrency radical. **I use Bitcoin because it's cheaper and easier than plastic, not because I want to destroy the establishment.**
You don't have to agree with my opinion, because I know it goes against the circle-jerk, but I think that this "documentary", if made, would destroy the credibility that Bitcoin has been building over the last few years.

I honestly don't know. Is this part of the reason for planning the fork?
