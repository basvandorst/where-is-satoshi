I pushed the transaction with the fee recommended by my wallet and it was not enough.    I should have checked,  but it's always worked before...  Bitcoin is a store of value -it isn't like I move it all of the time..  I have been using it since 2013 -- I had great hopes for it, but my confidence in it is way down..
I am not the first idiot to get coin stuck.   It is a common problem and uin my opinion problem with the design in general -- Shouldn't the recipient be the one to pay the fee?  They are the one with that benefits from gaining the money..  
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:56:29
The right solution would probably be the block size is adjusted based on the fees included..  
That way paying higher fees would create more capacity -- And you would get a symmetrical market that actually provided a feedback cycle.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:16:08
I wonder if the price rise may be caused in part by the high fees making it difficult to move, and thus less supply.  When you have a blind auction for blockspace prices are going to go up indefinitely.  Eventually the cost of moving the coin is going to surpass the value of the wallet and more and more bitcoin is going to be stranded, likely forever..    You have hyperdeflation making everyone hot to buy - but then all the transactions exasperate fee issue thus perpetuating the cycle till everyone has millions, but nobody can afford to move them..

A buck is still too expensive for a lot of transactions..  
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:17:11
I really was hoping somebody would offer some reassurance..   
I cannot get out of bitcoin..   I tried to move my money to coinbase, where I would gain the value without needing to use the clogged blockchain, but the blockchain was too clogged to move my coin.  I will try again when my transaction becomes unstuck,  but then it will cost even more,  and I fear that increased cost will be exponential.    There is no reason to expect fees to go down is there?  Everyone has to bid higher and higher.. 
Not really sure what you disagree with me about...  You haven't addressed any of the points I brought up.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:06:50
Don't I need to move my coin to a segwit wallet to use segwit?    Easier said than done -- That's a very expensive and time consuming proposition..  Chicken meet egg..  You have any guess how many addresses Coinbase for example has?   That migration alone is  going to take a massive amount of blockspace..
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:19:53
My coins are still stuck in a limbo transaction due to ever increasing fees.  Be supportive?  of what?  
Call me what you will,  but Bitcoin either works or it doesn't and right now -- It doesn't.  But more importantly it's going to get a lot worse before it will get better..  
Revolutions fail all of the time.  Cheerleading doesn't fix problems..  "Be supportive" is something you say while swinging pom-poms.   It doesn't address the problem at hand at all..  
Every day that passes, more and more wallets are becoming full of coins that cannot move--  That is just reality.   It is only a matter of time, and I don't think there is any legitimate solution that will change that.  All of the fixes are months away,  and Anyone with any sense will move their wallets to a centralized third party ASAP so that their coins can be redeemed off chain.. This will cause a run on the bank --  and an even more competitive auction for blockspace, further exasperating the problem.  
Rather than calling me a shrill,  can you give me any reason to have hope that this vicious cycle collapse will not happen?
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:42:20
No time for that.   It is what it is.   The checkmate is set..  It's only a matter of time.  
I disagree on blocksize.   Unlimited block size is the only solution that is going to work.   With Merkle trees etc,  You don't even need to permanently store them to know what they are and that they are valid.. 
We transmit huge files on the internet all of the time. Its stupid to think that money isn't important enough to use a fraction of youtube sized bandwidth..  It will play out how its going to play out, but the whole system will freeze in short order with the current fee system.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:44:57
Why not just move to something like IPFS so you can dedup all the storage?   There is no sense storing one copy on every node if it's all the same data that is going to be fairly rarely accessed and it can be cryptographically verified to be accurate.    
Closed minded thinking...   Satoshi even pointed out the solution in the white paper...  Clear as day..  Merkle trees.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:51:57
Maybe...   But I don't think it will be adequate or in time.  
Markets work because higher fees induce more capacity...  Bitcoin does not allow for more capacity, thus prices will keep rising and rising.  The time will come very quickly where low balance wallets are too expensive to move.    This will cause less bitcoin to circulate, thus diminishing supply -- and causing rises in price like we are seeing now..   
So high prices may not be a good thing...   They may be a sign of trouble.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:32:14
Why would fees come down?   Segwit?  Even if fully adopted blocks would still be full.    Lightning network?   We don't have that long.   
Fees will keep going up indefinitely because everyone is going to be desperate to get their coin out before frees get bigger than their wallet.  It's a blind auction, and the only way to be sure of winning is to outbid the other guy who's trying to outbid the other guy, who's trying to outbid the other guy...  Fees will go up exponentially for the foreseeable future -- Which isn't very long because nobody trades an unmovable coin..
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:50:05
Typical markets work because raising fees increase capacity..
Bitcoin does not work that way.    
Fees will keep going up forever because paying a higher fee than the next guy is the only way to get your coin moved..  Eventually the cost of using bitcoin will be too high, and people will just switch to something that works.  
"Too high" may be an opinion.  But the cost of your transaction becomes a larger and larger percentage of your balance, that opinion will become a lot less controversial in a hurry.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:25:29
I am very tempted to sell before the fees get larger than my wallet.   The more folks use bitcoin the higher fees will be -- I don't see any reason why we shouldn't expect them to keep soaring.

I do think the bitcoin community would be more successful finding other niche's that are not saturated with incumbents and where bitcoin would be ideally suited..  Credit and debit cards may be imperfect - but that is the bank's problem, not the consumers - and there are probably much simpler solutions than Bitcoin..
Streamium is on the right track.  Internet of things is also ideal, as machines don't need much persuading to pay in bitcoin.

Ripple isn't just another altcoin --  It is a platform to allow you to trade all sorts of assets at different gateways.  
It works VERY well for that.  It will work even better when more institutions get on board.   
If you don't get it, you don't get it,  but you are the one missing the boat - not Ripple..  
No, it will never be a libertarian decentralized utopia.   But there have been plenty of products that have succeeded in spite of centralization.   (Like almost everything invented to date)..

I find that generally cellphones are reliable until you need them to be. 
I think Bitcoin is a pretty bad fit for Brick and Mortar stores in general -- If I owned one I wouldn't put up "accept Bitcoin" signs because I would fear my staff would have to spend way too much time selling and explaining bitcoin instead of selling my product..   
@_date: 2015-06-02 08:48:25
I would agree...    But I don't think it ever really worth 1200 either.   Just overzealous fanbase...
I am a fan of Bitcoin.  i think it will change the world.   I don't know that it is a "get rich for sure" investment like many sell it though --  It is useful at whatever price..  Most investors are buying it because they think it is a "get rich for sure" investment.  While I hope I am right, some folks bought at 1200 and now own it at 220 or so..  
Supply and demand works when there is real scarcity,  but when folks are just holding to sell, it can only go so far -- and when Dell, Expedia, Dish, Overstock and the like are selling nearly everything they bring in,  there are always "Sell at market" books that need to be consumed before the price can go up..  And it can only go up so much till the speculators sell their hord, placing more downward pressure..  
And yes, you can look at history and try to say "this is the internet" or something like that --  But there are a lot of really cool inventions that never took off or lost out to a competing technology as well.  Elliptical curve cryptography isn't something you can sell the average Joe on very quickly..
Blockchain technologies can be used without user knowledge or interaction for satoshi's.  That may be the main use of bitcoin in the end.

As such, nobody knows what their price ought to be -and it is all crazy speculation.

Bitcoin prices often move up on bad news and down on good news.   There is little rhyme or reason other than "people are buying" or "people are selling"

That is only because the people interested in Cryptocurrencies enough to use Ripple are generally already in bitcoin.  
With Ripple you can already send dollars and have your recipient receive pesos, or Gold or Bitcoin etc etc.. That is a powerful tool.
It isn't something readily done on the Bitcoin platform.  (You could engineer it, but likely not without third party gateways)  
A healthy Ripple system could be quite a boon for Bitcoin as it has the potential to make trading your USD for Bitcoin (or gold or silver or pesos or yen) very quick and easy...

There have been many digital currencies before Bitcoin.  None of them have ended well.
Those who say that Bitcoin could reach Trillions in market cap tend to be selling bitcoin.  I hope they are right, but it is still a sales pitch and is likely going to be taken with a grain of salt.  
Bitcoin was at 1200..   Now it is hovering above 200...   The same "to the moon" arguments where being made at 1200 as are being made now.  If an investor had taken the advice back then, they would most likely be out of work.

Why does it need to go up?   So long as it is what the market says it should be, it is perfectly priced..   
Half of the reason it isn't more successful is because people measure it's success according to how expensive it gets..  That isn't a selling point to those who don't have any..  And it can get expensive just because people think it is going to get expensive.. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:16:58

Things like tamper-proof elections, proof of existence,  Decentralized stock exchanges, can be built upon the blockchain with little regard to the currency aside from needing a satoshi to operate. 
Those have the potential to have a bigger impact because they removed corrupt and intentionally-bloated-to-prevent-corruption overhead.

Bear = pessimist
Whale = Really big.
A bearwhale is somebody who put a massive amount of Bitcoin for sale at below market price...  The price gets stuck at his offer (and will not go above it until the entire amount for sale is consumed)  
It is a reasonably good stragegy if you want to move your coin and you have a ton of it, because there are not always enough people willing to buy your entire inventory -- and if you where to sell all at once you would drive the price down way further than you do if you just price it a bit below market and wait until the buyers come to you..

The private key is a big huge string of numbers and letters that will begin with 5.  Most likely it has a QR code above it.   It could also be a random string of words, like you describe.  
One of the most secure way to hold bitcoin is in a paper wallet.  That wallet could be hidden anywhere.   taped to bottom of drawers.  On page 342 of some random book on the bookshelf - Behind a picture in a frame.  Chances are there are two copies in two different locations.  (Perhaps this office effects  or safe deposit box would be easier and more condensed to search)

The problem with mining is that it doesn't do anything.. 
The same amount of coins will be produced with 3 miners as with 6 trillion..  There is only 25 BTC a block no matter how many gigahashes..

A wallet is basically just an insanely long randomly generated number..  It by itself is totally anonymous.  You don't need anyone's permission to make one - and nobody would know if you had or had not.  Just got to bitaddress.org or rushwallet.com and you can have one in seconds.
Whenever money goes in or out of the wallet, it came from somebody or went to somebody, who most likely knows something about you..  So it isn't totally anonymous.    Some institutions behave like banks, and keep detailed records (Coinbase, Circle etc)  A few transactions later it would be pretty difficult to say who's coin is who's and there are services out there to intentionally mix coin.   This can be done for legitmate reasons or illegitimate reasons.  (Perhaps you are doing payroll and don't want your employees to be able to figure out how much one another are paid for example.)  
Bitcoin is more traceable than cash, but still pretty darn difficult to trace.  
It does carry a big risk as far as volatility goes.  It may be worth 3000 next year or it could be 20 bucks.   I wouldn't invest more than you are willing to lose for any reason.

Finney attacks are incredibly difficult to pull off.   You have to control enough of the mining power to successfully pre-mine a block.  Then go and submit your transaction to the vendor between the time that you pre-mined your block and the time that somebody else mines a valid block.  Then you publish the pre-mined block which includes a transaction sending the same inputs back to yourself..
In a brick-n-mortar environment, this is insanely unlikely.   They would have to hang around for hours or days, then make their move really fast, cutting through any lines or other delays..

People don't care about it YET.  Most people don't care about or understand  TCP/IP either, but that doesn't stop them from using it.
Bitcoin is quickly getting mainstreamed in the realm of the vendors.  It is a no-brainier for them.  It is less easy to sell on the consumer side at least in America where we have all of the conveniences of banks..  But it has it's advantages and is usefull in a lot of cases on the consumer end as well  -- Quick buying media for example.   50 cents for a newspaper or 3 dollars for a video stream of an athletic game --  (We need these kind of vendors on board)
Once vendors are on board, and events like the Bitcoin bowl bring it into the spotlight..  Acceptance will pick up.
In the mean time pricing will go down for a very rational reason -- Vendors accept it, turn it into fiat, and consumer adoption hasn't yet caught up.  It isn't mispriced.  Price changes because supply and demand rationally calls for it to change.

Sorry to say it, but most BTC services that promise you money are suspect.   Bitcoin is a different Beast than Fiat money.  There is rarely such thing as interest in the bitcoin world.  
Most bitcoin investment schemes are scams.  Faucets may not be, but there are no promises, and they do tend to be a waste of time.
Bitcoin is an investment in itself.  But it and enjoy the ride..  Nobody would send their gold in to an untrusted third party in expectation of getting more back --  And if someone where to offer us Gold for little reason, we would be suspicious..   If bitcoin is digital gold it ought to behave as such..

Really the right kind of merchants need to embrace bitcoin in order for it to be hugely advantageous to the end user. 
In my mind those are things like 75 cents to read todays's local newspaper, or 3 or 4 dollars for a pay-per-view video or sporting event.
Those transactions can be paid via something like a Kryptokit extension in seconds, with very little data entry, and are too expensive or cumbersome for the VISA network to deal with.  If I have to enter 16 digits, name address CRC etc to read a newspaper article I won't bother, and if the vendor is going to pay 30 cents of the 75 for processing they won't bother..
Newspapers are literally dying because this technology didn't exist at the outset of the internet.

The business model, as they have disclosed it is that they do arbitrage with the customer money, take 20 percent of the profits for themselves, and credit the rest back..  So it isn't 1% per day. it is whatever the money earns minus 20%...
Certainly there would be other ways of securing capital.  But any capital is usable capital -- and crowd sourcing certainly takes a hell of a lot less underwriting than anything else.   Banks are not too thrilled about dealing with Bitcoin businesses from what I have heard..

Centralized organizations have the right to use bitcoin too..  It is up to people weather they care to trust them or not.  If you do trust some organization that is your choice.
As for me. I buy my bitcoins at circle, then transfer them to my own wallet.  When I need fiat, I transfer them back, and they sell them for me.  
I trust circle more than the random Ned I might meet up with from localbitcoins.  He is a centralized organization too,  run by one man, with little oversight.  I can either trust him or not..

@_date: 2014-12-22 21:16:43
I think that they do seek 'regulatory certainty'.  
As things stand now the laws are vague, and entrepreneurs do not know for certain what laws apply to bitcoin and what laws do not apply.   Being wrong about your interpretation of such laws can land you in federal prison for a couple of years.
So bad regulations that are known are in many way better than uncertainty.   If NY laws suck, we can do business elsewhere.

The price will not go up until more people want to buy than want to sell.   If you want to sell, then you are the reason it is not going up.

Nobody knows.   
If you don't invest more than you are willing to lose, you shouldn't need to worry.
My guess is that if it is adopted on a mass scale supply and demand will make it will go up significantly.   Of course many people think like I do and are willing to pay a lot for it because of the future potential.  
My analysis is that vendor acceptance is outpacing consumer acceptance at the time being and that is creating some significant surpluses of sellers. But we need vendors in order for mass adoption to happen, so what's gotta happen gotta happen.

Bitcoin doesn't go up because the media likes it.   It goes up when people find it useful.   The people that buy and sell on media reports are just day traders trying to make a buck.  The price goes up when new people buy and hold or use, or when current users increase their involvement.
I suspect the fake Mt Gox numbers had Bitcoin prices artificially inflated for a long time..  Finding a solid price is a good thing in for the long term.  Volitility is one of the great drawbacks of Bitcoin, and we really don't need it to swing like a tetherball every time a story comes out.  In the long term, if Bitcoin works and people use it, supply and demand will make the price go up.

I think the prices do generally converge.  The price may look different, but often the dollars at one exchange are less useful than dollars at another exchange because of latency in withdraws,  Fees and various other factors.  So a Bitstamp USD may be worth slightly different than a BTC-E USD..
It is really easy to move Bitcoin fairly fast -- But USD are still pretty darn slow and expensive to move..

For example, My dad sent me some BTC to subsidize my boy's Little league fees..   The league doesn't take BTC -  so I have to withdrawl the BTC through coinbase (Buys are instant - Sells are not.  Took 4 days)   then use my visa debit to pay the league..  
Obviously them taking BTC would be the best -- but if not, a instant BTC to visa would be decent alternative..

The IRS does lose in court.
Raise some BTC and hire a lawyer.  
The problem really is this:  if the IRS had ruled differently there would have been people protesting the disadvantages of the other ruling too.  
Bitcoin culture doesn't respond to obstacles  by tantruming and try to move mountains.  It is to use technology to swifty and efficiently flow right around them.  I  would suggest a  better spend our resources  would be writing wallet software that generates the required logs, and more importantly optimizes our selection of bitcoin being spent so that we optimize our tax liability.   Since Bitcoin isn't truly fungible, that should be easy to do.  Every input has a cost basis.  Specific inputs are traded for goods or services.  We can trade those inputs that are going to create the gains or losses that most fit our tax goals.

I try to separate the ledger from the commands..  
Bitcoins live on a ledger in the internet maintained by a peer to peer network.  The ledger says for example Bob has 1 bitcoin, Alice has 3, Clyde has 1.2 etc.   
The network listens for commands to move the coins, and does so so long as they are signed with the proper key-codes.  The wallet software keeps track of these key codes and sends the commands to the network when the user asks it to.  
That glosses over most of the complexity, but it gets the main gist down.

Coinbase isn't much easier, if we are honest.
The the key failure here was the wallet software on the phone allowing a 0 fee transaction.  (If he had scanned the QR code instead of typing in the amount manually it likely would have worked fine)  
Wallet software writers need to have a more persuasive "DONT BE AN ID10T" error on zero free transmissions..
It would also be wise to have wallet software smart enough to send trumping transactions with fees.

Their claim was that they had 2.2 million + under management.   Of course most of their claims where lies.   So take that number with a big fat grain of salt..   
I suspect half or more of that was funny money that they made up and called "earnings".  Some folks removed their earnings, others re-invested, so it is hard to know for sure how much principal was actually lost vs how much "paper balance" was lost.

Is there any reason to believe they are legit?   Where is their data center?   What are the owner's names?  Do they have a long and detectable presence on the internet before this outfit popped up?  Who is the domain registered to?  If it is legit, why are they hiding behind an anonymous registration?  When you are paid, are you paid with freshly mined coin? or coin that has been circulating for quite some time?  Can you see evidence in the blockchain trackers that their pools mining blocks?  What is the maximum purchase at a time?   Certainly they only have so many miners, and ordering more hardware takes some turn around time?  How come there are rampant misspellings on their website?  
5% commissions on your downline earnings smells ponzi.   Mining pays what it pays.  It doesn't pay what it pays plus 5%..  Ponzi's on the other hand work exactly that way..

If there are "sellers at market"  The price can only go down, not up..  Until all the sellers at market have been consumed by demand.. 
Retailers are "Sellers at market" in most cases..  
Also , so long as Bitcoin is circulating, we don't need as much of it..  It can be used over and over and over again..  
The truth is for mainstream adoption, it needs to be used and not solely hoarded.  If it is being used, and converted to fiat, it  will hold the price down.   If vendors start accepting it Business to Business transactions it could cause the prices to stablilize and go up --  But unless you are a high risk buyer and the seller doesn't trust you - you generally want to take advantage of whatever credit your vendor is willing to extend.. I don't know that Bitcoin is the best solution for B2B transactions.  It is best fit for transactions with untrusted strangers..

Fungible means that one coin is indistinguishable from another.  If the "Mt. Gox" coins move for example,  it is noticed, and we read about it on Reddit. (40 times)..  The Silk road coins moved through the Us Marshal accounts then you can see where those where moved to Draper..    For all future history, the coins are going to be traceable through those transactions..  
This could pose problems in "possession of stolen property" cases..  A hacker steals some private keys with malware then  buys dell with the bitcoin, Subsequent, Coinbase sells the dell coin to me..   My coin is incontrovertibly provably stolen, and that could be a legal problem, depending on Jurisdiction...
Generally money is protected.   A 10 dollar bill is a 10 dollar bill, and it's history is irrelevant.   Bitcoin should be the same, but it doesn't have  the features built in to make it the same, so that will be left up to the courts..

Seems to me the feasibility of running a Finney attack while buying groceries at the store is pretty ridiculously hard.

Accepting bitcoin is a good idea for all vendors at this point.  It is  like taking cash.  Coinbase and Bitpay will both trade your bitcoin for cash, or alternatively Coinkite will lock your bitcoin to a fiat value (So you always have $x worth of bitcoin)
With that said, using bitcoin as a key point of your business model isn't really what it is all about.   If you make furniture, make good furniture, don't make furniture for bitcoin.  Take bitcoin as a payment method, and market such, but that isn't really what it is all about.

I assume the additional risk is that if you have 50% BTC on both exchanges and Bitcoin falls from 800 to 300 you have lost 31% of you initial investment?  (And had to have made up all that ground on your profits)..  Correct?
@_date: 2014-06-06 21:51:20
Well,  there are quite a few times that I look at the exchanges and the price is 3-5% different between two or three of them.  Buy on one sell on the other Boom, it is realistic.  At the end of the day you re-balance your holdings.   The reported earnings do track fairly well with market conditions.  They do not promise 1%.. They promise somewhere between -3% and 3%.  (In short,  you could lose everything) The results tend to be about 1% per day, but there are lots of days lower than that, and even a few negative ones.. 
Bitcoin-trader's mining offerings are currently losing money...  As they should be, based on the math.  If you invest 100 dollars today you will get something like 76 dollars back over the course of a year..  It used to be much better, but today's difficulty increase puts it well into the red. 
If it seems to good to be true, it probably is..  But only probably. I invested. I have all my principal back, and I am still earning.

The thing is 1, they discliam liablilty for any losses due to website breakage.   2 they openly say they can lose up to 3% per day of your money..  They lock in the funds for 120 days, so 3% per day can get them off the hook pretty darn fast..

Yep..    
 I look at the price differences between the exchanges, and I see how it would be easy to make the numbers they are making.   As those differences have decreased, so have the earnings. 
  
 The mining shares also pay in accordance with what they should pay.. You can plug the numbers in..  As of today, I believe that is negative.
That doesn't prove anything either way.. but it does tilt the scales a little bit towards credibility.. 
Bitcoin is a 0 or the moon type investment.  Those of us invested in  Bitcoin are certainly have the risk profile to gamble on something like bitcoin trader..  If we own bitcoin, we know there is a significant likelyhood it could go to 0.  There is also a significant likelyhood it could be worth a lot.
The folks running Bitcoin-trader seem to be quite helpful, personal and real.  They aggressively disassociate themselves from HYIP...  Doesn't prove anything.  The audit they promised audit might..  We shall see.

Vendor adoption is outpacing consumer adoption, but mass consumer adoption wasn't going to happen until there was someplace to spend it..
The truth of the matter is that Bitcoin was likely inflated in price precisely because it was illiquid..  Kinda like when Mt. Gox was inflated over Bitstamp and BTC-E.. The price was high because the dollars couldn't get out, and there was no point to selling..  Now that it Bitcoin is more usable, it is going to be used more..   Dell, expedia etc are going to be sellers in the marketplace..   That is going to drive the price down before it drives it back up.

It's a Ponzi.  All the evidence points that way except for the wishful thinking.
My suspicion is that they have had a cashflow negative weekend because of the fake audit silliness..  They need to convert USD to BTC to make their daily payment.   
I doubt the game is up at this point, but the day is coming. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 17:56:58
I would refer back to these charactaristics  as to "evidence it is a ponzi" Plagerized from 
"Daily returns of around 1%
Investment lock-up period
The company is registered in Panama
Offer high referral commissions
Anonymous owners (even though they claim to operate out of London)
No proof of income generating activity
Provide a link to a HYIP scripts website"
All of those are true...  Thus far..  None of it is slander.  That leads somebody without a vested interest to say "If it looks like a duck, it is probably a duck"  
That isn't FUD..  That is just things a diligent investor ought to be aware of in assessing how much risk they are willing to take..  It is what it is, and it is Bitcoin-Trader's responsibility to prove that they are not..   Their answer has normally been "Trust is built over time"  Which avoids discussing any of those issues at all..    Trust can also be bought over time with daily payments.
Those who have invested have a vested interest in the business model being true, and as such they throw the facts in the FUD column and cling to the fact that "we keep getting paid"   The facts are the facts, and the evidence is the evidence and the preponderance of it is those points..
When I ask hard questions about the mathematics of how Bitcoin Trader operates I have always gotten diversionary obtuse answers that don't address the issues brought up... That is why I "Bring up the same old point over and over" as one of the commentators below stated...
My last share bought at 650 and cashed out at 330   I earned 65% in daily payments..  If half of that was in bitcoin they lost their shirt...  I ask questions like that, and the PR guy guesses and gives obviously wrong answers..  The excuse maker customers come up with all kinds of hypothetical answers that may have some bearing on reality, but are all speculation.   
That question has an answer..  BT knows the answer..  And even though the question has been asked 10 times they do not answer coherently...  
Its a "ponzi scheme" is an adequate answer to the question I have asked 10 or more times..  Their lack of answers give credibility to all the other points..  
Arbitage is one of the most popular covers for a ponzi scheme.

Remember also,  That a credit card transaction can be reversed 60 days or so down the road...  So if Bitpay calculates that there is a 99.95 percent change of a transaction being the the next block it is probably much more golden than taking a visa transaction which can be reported stolen and reversed much later..

Once Bitcoin becomes mainstream the need for coinbase and bitpay will decrease..   Right now, it is kinda hard to find somebody who has bitcoin to sell you -- but as it mainstreams everyone will have some, and they will be willing to buy stuff from you for it, they will be willing to pay you with it, and they will be willing to trade with you for it..  You won't need the gateways between dollars and bitcoin because either will work    
They will have tons of small competitors, and being a big bureaucratic ultra-formal organization will be more of a hindrance than a help.

What is the thinking behind this requirement?  
For the most part the rest seems fairly reasonable.  There probably needs to be a distinction between wallets and accounts for the purpose of The unclaimed property requirement.  In many cases businesses will not want to have any access to "customer accounts"  It is more secure that way -- If they do not have control, they cannot relinquish the property to the state..

The real boss when it comes to the economy and all things money is the Fed..   Congress and the president have relatively little power.
Everyone knows that the economic policies of the USA are unsustainable, and they are no more or less unsustainable with GOP in charge than with the Dems.  Both parties propose spending policies that are unsustainable.
I would argue "That which cannot be sustained shall not be sustained"  and the figureheads in charge might change the pace of the collapse a little bit, or they may change the talking points on the way down, but what shall happen shall happen.
Bitcoin may or may not be helped or hurt by this.  If groceries are still priced in USD and I need groceries, I will be buying groceries before I buy bitcoin..   Unless Groceries get priced in Bitcoin, inflation is only going to be a moderate incentive to buy, offset with the need to buy other things.

It is the miner's fault, not Ghash.io.   Moreover, if their competitors where more aggressive, Ghash.io wouldn't get the market share it does.  If the other pools would add computing power, then Ghash wouldn't be a problem.  
The scaremongers are just as bad of bad actors as Ghash...  There as not been a 51 percent attack.  The fact that Ghash passes 51 percent is not an issue unless they either want to destroy bitcoin, and undermine their own business, or there are a bunch of sensationalist scaremongers who pretend like having 51 percent occasionally is the same thing as a 51% attack.
The solution is for the miners to go elsewhere.  The market will find a way to entice them to do so..

Because within seconds of submitting your Bitcoin transaction, even with Zero confirmations, it is less likely to be reversed than any credit card transaction..  If merchants are willing to take the risk of accepting Visa, they will be willing to accept Bitcoin, even without a confirmation.  That IS after all the way Bitpay works - and they have never experienced a reversal last I read..  The risk is insignificant.
A confirmation doesn't mean anything significant.  It too still can theoretically be reversed.  As time moves on it becomes less and less likely..

Most companies stayed out of the Bitcoin business because of regulatory uncertianty.  I believe apple may have had some other motives as well, but that was the primary excuse.
Much of the regulatoroy uncertainty has faded at this point.  With the IRS guidence, FinCEN coments, Yellen's comments etc, it is fairly clear that using bitcoin is going to be legal in the US, and as such, a company like Apple will lose marketshare if they do not allow their customers to use the products that they would like to use..

I think it will bounce off 200 and settle back at 300 to 400.
As long as there are ample sellers, the price will not go up.   Dell, Expedia, Dish Etc are probably everyday sellers.  
Bitcoin is no longer just held by hoarders and speculators.  It is being used.  As long as it is flowing it can be used over and over and over again.  So the more it flows, the less you need. If there is always a supply, demand will have to consume the supply before it nudges the price upward..   Speculators underestimated the velocity component in their "to the moon speculation" 
Exponential adoption will come after the market stabilizes and the volatility  slows..  Once Bitcoin has found a price it is happy at for 4 or so months, It will ramp upward perhaps exponentially..  
I am still a buyer..  Eventually it will be into 4 maybe 5 digits. but it has to grow in order to do that, and this phase is part of the growth process..

The Cryptographic systems behind bitcoin could solve a ton of these issues.  The problem is that the SSN is a 'public key' and everyone knows it..  We ought to have a private key that only we know, and a public key that businesses and governments etc can confirm we are who we say we are with..

Basically it is a list of all of the transactions from the beginning of time.  It allows any person or program to check if bitcoin they receiving is real and has not been spent elsewhere.
A block is a set of transactions that has come in since the last block (more or less)  Each block cryptographically references the prior block so they cannot be created out of order.  (thus the chain)  
Millions and millions of computers try to solve a really hard puzzle - (Like a massive Suduku puzzle)  Hard to solve, easier to verify.  Whichever computer wins the race to solve the puzzle gets to append it's version of the block onto the chain,  And gets rewarded for creating it.  The rest of the network trusts this block because the solver had to invest a lot of resources into solving the puzzle.  (proof of work)

Yah,  I would have stopped asking the math question if they had ever given me anything that resembled a coherent answer... 
The math question was "If Bitcoin drops from 650 to 300 or so, how can you remain solvent?"   They refused to answer.  The closest thing I got to an answer was "We where fine last drop"
Math is kinda non-negotiable, and if the answer is the answer, then the BTC stops flowing..  The shares that expired over the weekend where bought for around 650 and cashed out at about 300.   
Sucks being right.  
@_date: 2014-11-10 06:52:13
There is a limited supply of Bitcoin..  If it is adopted exponentially, like lots of internet technologies have been, the laws of supply and demand would tell us that the price could get quite high..
The advantage bitcoin has is that it really doesn't lose much functionality when the price goes up.  (It doesn't matter which decimal point you use to buy your stuff with)  So demand ought to effect price a ton more than price effects demand, so long as it is being actually used (and not hoarded)
The whole thing could collapse, and go to near zero, but that is looking less and less likely..
I would advise most anyone "Buy enough that you won't care if you lose it all"   If it goes where some people think it is going to go, it could make you a lot of money..  If not, you didn't lose much..

Generally this is true, and as such, Bitcoin ought to be targeting industries where more trivial transactions are needed.   For example newspaper and magazine content.   
In the old days, if I was interested in today's news, I dropped two quarters in a machine and bought a newspaper.   No such technology exists for the internet - until bitcoin... 
If I want to read today's news, I probably don't want a monthly subscription for 10 bucks.  Fees prevent the newpaper from charging 50 or 75 cents for today's issue.  I certainly am not going to want to type in a 16 digit number, my name, address etc etc to read an article or two.   With Kryptokit, I can click twice and it is paid..

I think you misunderstand.  My point is that since Dell, Overstock, Expedia, Dish, etc have started taking Bitcoin we have seen a steady decrease, with only a few serious up-ticks ..  
I agree--  If people start hoarding again, then the price will increase faster,  but if you want exponential adoption, it really needs to be usable and spendable,  so long as there are bitcoin for sale everyday, then folks have to buy through the entire sell wall before the price can raise.  That means slower price climbs than if people where all just holders.  
The reality is that Vendor adoption has been outpacing consumer adoption..  In the current environment, I expect the price to climb slowly..  Dell, overstock and company aren't going away..  there are likely to be a lot more "daily sellers" coming on board.

Pretty unlikely..   
Remember that these companies are selling you cash.  Visa and mastercard transactions are reversible.  You can buy some bitcoin, call you bank, and say the card is stolen and that you didn't authorize the transaction, and in most cases they will not pay.  The Bitcoin vendor is then out the Bitcoin and the cash.
You can buy in person via localbitcoins or the like, or you can buy online from a company like Coinbase or perhaps someday Circle.

Did you watch the latest DeAngelo piece about Big numbers in Bitcoin?  
If you delve into bitcoin too far - be careful that you don't become one of those "The most paranoid strategy is the best strategy" folks.  If people believe they need a offline linux armory wallet to be a responsible bitcoin owner, it is kinda a turn off..  Paper wallets are pretty hard to hack.
Bitcoin has problems, and the user's lack of security is one of the bigger ones.. But Bitcoin is also doing a great job of solving those problems and helping better security be mainstream security.  2 factor authentication, multisig wallets.  Trezor devices.  There was one company working on using your pulse as 2FA..   
Contrast Bitcoin to the mainstream centralized systems --  JP Morgan Chase, Target, Home Depot, and whoever is in the newspaper the morning of your talk.   Decentralization makes hacking a lot harder...   
"Why did he rob the bank?  Because that was where the money is"   Decentralization makes crime a lot less profitable.

The market price of bitcoin needs to be what the market price of bitcoin is.  The fact that the market works and that if there is excess supply the price goes down, and that if there is excess demand the price goes up means that Bitcoin is working just fine.
There are plenty of reasons why bitcoin's price is going down.  There is nothing wrong with down.  Up helps those who hold, down helps those who don't yet hold.

Well,  It would be nice to debate you, but you haven't stated a case, that is kinda hard to do..  You are wrong though.  
Can you send 2 dollars over the internet to a food bank for example without entering a 16 digit number, a 3 digit back of he card number along with your name?  How about sending a quarter for a magazine or newspaper article you might like to read?  Advantage bitcoin.  You are wrong about number 2.   Sure, there are lots of payment systems that have other advantages.  But for nickle and dime charity and  vending stuff  Bitcoin wins.  
Number 1, is basic economics..   Supply is fixed.  Demand is the question.  Since you are wrong about number 2, there likely will be some demand, therefore you answer of Zero is likely wrong.   I say it will be worth somewhere between .01 and 1,000,000 dollars..   Chances are I am right and you are wrong,  (Mostly because I selected a more reasonable range)

In order to say that you have to define what currency is, and prove that Bitcoin is indeed the same thing as currency and more importantly is not different than currency.   
While it can do some of the things currency can do- it does it in a different way.  (Via Database entries)   and it can also do a lot more..   
So it is inaccurate to say "Bitcoin is currency".  Bitcoin is Bitcoin.  Currency is a relic of the past.   It isn't the same thing.

Yep..  It works for Bitcoin already  -- It's just the Bank part that it needs to work on.   They have a few banks coming into the fold..

So if I am reading this right.  A guy with control over a mining pool would have go to a retailer, spend his Bitcoin,  have his mining pool insert a double spend, not tell the rest of the network about it, then win the mining contest to confirm the block?  
It could happen, theoretically.  But really?  I suspect the chances are pretty insanely minuscule compared to our crook just using a stolen visa card.  
BitPay has been accepting zero conf transactions for a long time without a double spend.

If headlines steered buyers the price would have gone to zero when Gox happened.   I would say that headlines steer the noise.  The faith in the long term viability of the platform is what holds the price where it is now..

Having 49 percent means that over time you are going to get 49 percent of the paychecks, but you are going to split them 49 units worth of ways..
If you have a small pool lets say 5%, over time you are going to get 5% of the paychecks and spread them 5 units worth of ways..  
There is a definite advantage to getting paid more frequently.. Getting a paycheck every 20 minutes on average is a lot better than getting one every  200 minutes on average, even if the sum total amount in the end is the same.

It would be nice if Bitcoin evangelists targeted companies where Bitcoin is the best option for payment as well...  (Newpapers and magazines being the best examples)  There is no means for trivial cash transactions over the internet..  (like dropping 50 cents into a newspaper machine)  When Bitcoin starts filling that gap the user base will grow...
It is an option as an alternative against credit cards, but you have a pretty entrenched incumbent that works fairly well from a consumer perspective.  If I had a choice to buy a Dell with Bitcoin or a credit card, There really isn't a reason other that "coolness" I would choose Bitcoin..   I am still going to have to part with my precious bitcoin, I am still going to have to give Dell my personal info for shipping etc..

Yep.  Price goes up and down.   Right now it is jumping around more than normal, but jumping prices is par for the course..  It is really fun when it goes up,  Not so fun when it goes down.   But it is fun to buy low and spend high.. 
The hope is that exponential growth will both make it increase in value and become more stable..   Right now there is only 5 billion or so dollars worth of bitcoin, so when somebody wants to buy or sell 100k or so, often there isn't a party willing to sell/buy that much all at once, so the price can go up and down quickly.   Once there are a ton more people using it, there will always be a lot of people looking to buy and sell, so it won't jump nearly as fast..

Data is value.  That is why we use the internet, watch TV, Look up phone numbers,  use online banking etc..   Information is useful.  
Bitcoin really isn't much different.  It is a database that says who has accumulated value, available to trade.  We have a more primitave database of the same nature on little green peices of paper in our wallet.  The two databases do exactly the same thing - except one is manipuated electronically the other is manipulated physically.  There are advantages and disadvanges to both, and both have their place.

I believe that Bitcoin will find it's niche, and mainstream adoption will begin in full force.   I tend to think that this niche will be pay per view videos, subscriptions to online newspaper content, and other 'Drop a buck in the box" type cover charges where people probably wouldn't bother if they had to fill out a form giving over their identity...
Once it isn't quite so "weird" adoption will happen at an accelerated pace, and it will be built in to supply lines etc..  Use an item, it gets re-ordered and paid automatically..  
I don't think the price increase will be as dramatic as some people think because the more Bitcoin is used, the less you need..   So long as there is always some for sale at market, market needs to be totally consumed before the price can start.  It is a high velocity currency.

I am  not unreasonable.   If you look at the link I drew from you will see me making the same arguments you are.   "They could be"..  It's possible.  
It is possible that they are legit..  There is just zero evidence of it yet..  Aside from faith and "it could be"  excuses..  There is nothing in Venn diagram that provable escapes into the non-overlap.   Till there is I am going to call it like I see it..

That is not a finney attack, This is a finney attack:  
It requires you to withhold pre-mined blocks.   
It works well in internet transactions where you can click buy as soon as you know you have a pre-mined block then publish the block as soon as the transaction processes.  (If you are Ghash.io -- who most everyone isn't)  That is hard to do in a grocery store though..  Most people have to wait a VERY long time to mine a block..
The algorythms for calculating probability of confirmation look at more than just your own node.   They watch how much of the network sees the good transaction and gives you a calculated certainty of confirmation.  Once it is a risk you are willing to take, then go with it.  For most transactions it gets into the high ninety percentages within seconds..  
Remember even a confirmation can be undone.  It is always a "how sure are you" calculation..  and the answer is pretty quickly "pretty darn sure" assuming it is a valid transaction with fees..

Bitcoin is like cash.  You either have it or you don't.  There is no credit or counterparties in between the sender and the recipient.
A bitcoin wallet is at it's core just a very large random number..  That number generates public and private keys.  The public key is kinda like a donation box.  Anybody can put money in, but nobody can take money out without having the private key..

As is the case with most things,  the question comes down to "Just how paranoid do you want to be"  
If you buy a bitcoin from Circle or coinbase, theoretically it has your name attached to it, assuming someone with a subpoena where to ask.  (Which is fairly unlikely)  
Once you send it anywhere - it becomes plausible deniability. Nobody know who you sent them to or who owns the receiving wallet.   If they where to look they could see that all of those coins belonged to you once..  (If they had gotten an answer after subpoenaing your broker)  But they aren't going to get the subpoena without cause - and if they have cause chances are they already caught you.. 
There are several mixing services out there that would do the trick of removing the 'These coins all used to belong to this guy" thing.  That is the way to go if you want to be only moderately paranoid.

Sure,  but a lot of my friends don't buy bitcoin because they can't spend it.  So you will probably have to tollerate some downward pressures to get the upward of mainstream demand..  
All in all ease of entrance and exit will make Bitcoin what bitcoin can become.  Price will do what it needs to do, but we ought not try to preseverve a high price for the sake of having a high price..  That wasn't the point of bitcoin.  If it works, that will be a side effect.

You can want all you want, but the fact of the matter is that people get arrested because the rules are ambiguous.
There is no guarantee that mass adoption will be the way you are envisioning it.  I tend to suspect it will be an internet niche thing, and it will most commonly be converted by the vendor right back to cash.     It will excel where it excels, and the other transaction method will continue to thrive where they thrive.  
"Your laws suck, I'm going someplace else" is much better than getting arrested for selling unlicensed securities  or money transmission even though Bitcoin isn't really a security and doesn't really get transmitted.
It would be better to get good regulation,  but frankly the incumbents in the financial sector aren't going to allow that, and bitcoin for the most part will not care -- It works despite what the regulators say.

You are right, but not all the way right.   The chances of guessing a well designed brain wallet phrase would be fairly slim.   Lets say I used a phrase "1804 j Ohn 1832 m Ichael 1854 j Ames 1879 p Eter 1920 h Enry 1945 j Acob 1973 a Mos Gershwender-Simonson "  
That may be a genealogy that is very verifiable, but insanely obscure.  The odd spacing and perhaps the years being off by 3 could make it even more secure...

But if I could read part of a newpaper article and pay 50 cents to buy the right to read the remainder of said paper -it would be fairly revolutionary..  The newspapers would get a payment method that they lost with the advent of the internet - and consumers would get a no-hassle way to pay..

Coinbase is what it is.  It works well enough.  It has little competition at this point, so it doesn't need to get a lot better.  That will change soon.  
The traditional finance sector is 8.4 percent of the GDP.   It is protected and so it also has no incentive to innovate.  There is plenty of room to make a profit just by cutting out this middleman from most transactions..   Yes bitcoin companies will want to make money, but there is plenty of money to be made.  
You have strayed from your points..
1 you agree that there is a use for Bitcoin. (Tipping)  There are lots of other uses as well... Remittences etc...
In short, You lost the debate..  You can believe whatever you choose to believe.  But your first contention is wrong, and as such the second as well.
Those coins below 300 on the list that are worth 0 where never market leaders.  Nobody believed in them for long.  Nobody invested like people are investing in Bitcoin.  VP's didn't leave lush jobs with companies like Visa, Mastercard, Facebook to pursue the new frontiers like they are with Bitcoin.  Regulators didn't establish guidelines to mainstream them.

Bitcoin addresses are not assigned, they are made up.   You can't ban numbers.  You cannot regulate the use of numbers.
There are zillions of possible addresses and no link between an address and a person unless they publicize it or spend recklessly.

It would have to be somebody with more than 50% and evil intent.   
There is really little possibility of any one person or entity gaining 50% power -- except perhaps a mining pool. In the past their miners tend to scatter when that has happened.
The economic incentive if you want to be rich with Bitcoins is to not undermine the system and destroy the foundation of your wealth.   Anyone who has invested enough to come anywhere near 51% has a massive incentive not to be evil to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:58:14
If that where true it would be a problem already.   It is not in the mining pools best interest to pay so much better than their competition that they undermine confidence in bitcoin..    They are much better off to pay a competitive return but not too competitive of a return and keep the public's confidence in Bitcoin high.   
If Bitcoin collapses the entities that will be hit the absolute hardest is the bitcoin miners.  It makes zero sense that they would allow the system to self destruct..

Bitcoin would be ideal for transaction where I would put 3 quaters in a slot and grab a newspaper - or pay 3 dollars to watch a game on pay-per-view etc.  Often filling out a form with a 16 digit credit card, 3 digit CRC, name and address info  is pretty cumbersome vs a couple clicks with bitcoin.

The advantage of an online purchase is that you know when you have a pre-mined block and have the one-click ability to instantly execute your first, then second spend.

You shouldn't switch.     It isn't intended to be a replacement for any and every other kind of currency.   It is a handy way to pay for certain things over the internet that would be a hassle to pay for other ways..  It has certain advantages (Built in notary) and certain disadvantages (no built in mediator)  You win some you lose some - and in some transactions it makes a lot of sense,  (buck or two purchases or donations that would be cumbersome with Visa)  and in some cases it doesn't make much sense at all (buying a Dell)  
At any rate,  You are totally off topic.  Bitcoin-trader had very little to do with bitcoin, aside from it being their made up story as to how they pretended to make money and the fact that they used it as a payment processor.  They where just another scam like the thousands of others just like them on the internet.  The fact that they put "bitcoin" in their name didn't mean they ever even touched the stuff, aside from using it as a payment processor.

Continuing what?
I gave my opinion.  Don't try to make my opinion anything more than it is.  "Regulatory clarity is good for bitcoin entrepreneurs"  
Regulation is what it is, and it often sucks, although not always.  No matter what regulation anyone proposes the crowd panics, boos, and starts throwing tomatoes.   If the opposite regulation had been proposed the same thing would have happened. But the truth is that clarity is needed.  I am required to file taxes, and I need to know how to do so, lest I get busted.  Chances are no matter how the IRS says to do it, people are going to not like it.  That's because taxes suck.  But they suck worse when you do them wrong and get a trip to jail.  
You are not going to get standardization.  There are hundreds of jurisdictions around the world, all with their own agendas and cronyism to contend with.  Clearity ought to be the priority, then as many Bitcoin friendly jurisdictions that can be mustered.

You can buy it or sell it person to person.   My co-workers and I use it to settle small debts all of the time.  If you don't do this it is because you don't do it.  Not because it cannot be done..
Competing Currencies are not bitcoin.   Bitcoin has a fixed supply and thus any demand will give it a value of greater than zero which was your argument.  A drain on bitcoin is not price = zero.

It would be better if vendors just took Bitcoin..  ;-) 
Eventually a bank will come along that allows you to deposit and withdrawl in Bitcoin and use an ATM. card to deposit and withdrawl USD  Once this happens all of these bridge hacks will die quickly.

And yes you could build a blockchain that ran on something else, but why?   You have a perfectly good one that runs on Bitcoin..  Anything else is going to be expensive to re-invent and would likely re-introduce the same forms of centralization that Bitcoin avoids.  
Another SHA-256 blockchain is probably unfeasible at this point because there is so much useless Bitcoin mining equipment laying around that you could get 51%ed in an instant.

VPN providers are actually the ideal business to use bitcoin..   They want a relatively anonymous relationship with their clientbase, and they don't need to be bothered with billing hassles..   Bitcoin is like cash,  so you have either paid or you haven't  -- Unlike Visa, where somebody can give you stolen numbers, and the money will be taken away weeks or months later... 
There are good vendors to buy Bitcoin from -- It really depends on your country what your best option is..  --  But ATM's are pretty cutting edge -- There isn't enough competition to drive the prices down..  They gouge you..

The fact that somebody has 51% of the hashing power isn't dangerous to bitcoin in and of itself, provided that player wants bitcoin to be solvent and successful..   The problem is that the ability to control 51 percent is a problem if that party wants to break bitcoin.   Before now, that seemed rather unfeasible, but now the 51% threshold has been surpassed, there is a centralized entity that could potentially be attacked, taken over, or corrupted.  
The problem is mostly theoretical, but theoretically it is a big problem.

None of the payment processors wait for transactions to confirm (Bitpay, coinbase etc)  Because you don't need to..   
If a transaction is propagated it can theoretically be trumped out and overwritten, but it is quite impractical to do, and the risk is small.   Most folks don't control large mining pools.

I don't think that is what they are selling --  They are collecting donations so that the foundation can invest in various efforts to create a better Bitcoin...  There may be some donors that use thier donations to buy legitimacy, but those probably aren't the donors you want anyway.
There is an illusion that donors are legitimate because you call them 'members'   But the truth of the matter is that unless they are vetted they are only donors.   The nature of bitcoin is that anybody can give money to anybody without being vetted...  I don't think that ought to change.

After 10 minutes (Usually less) you know for sure that a charge is irreversible.   You don't get that with a credit card transaction for 90 days or more...  For most transactions, waiting the 10 minutes is overkill.  If it has propagated out to the network the risk is quite minimal that a double spend could trump it.
In short, no..

The idea that anybody can build a competing blockchain isn't terribly practical these days..  Particularly using bitcoin technology, because there is so much mining power in existence that your new blockchain can be 51%ed in an instant if you are significant enough for anybody to care about..
Colored coins can use the blockchain while more or less ignoring the bitcoin value..

While Bitcoin is a requires no trust, there is no problem with trusting somebody who provides value in exchange for trust, so long as you choose to trust them..
All in all, I think the risks are fairly small and your chances of somebody trying to double spend you compared to the chances somebody tryin a fraudulent CC transaction or counterfeit currency is probably insignificant,  But if a vendor wants to dump off that risk, and there is a third party willing to take the risk, that is a choice that they ought to be free to make.  
Every transaction ever has risk.   Bitcoin does a pretty darn good job a being low risk.   But the fact that risk still exists isn't a fatal flaw..  Being in business at all is risky,  Vendors need to have a realistic picture of the risks, and make the wisest move for their business..  
Within the bitcoin community there are a lot of people who propose "the most paranoid model is the best model"  but the truth is there is always a balance between efficiency and risk.  If you are selling 5 dollar coffees your risk model ought to be different than if you are selling Cash or Gold or top end cars..

If you use you own real wallet (one from bitaddress.org or the like) there is no way that the state can collect it for non-use and take it as unclaimed money.. If you where to use one issued by coinbase or circle or the like that is different, and the state wants your money, and they will likely be able to get it.  You would have to have a secure place to put the keys where nobody could steal them, and you would be able to recover them later.  (Bury them?)  
Brain wallets are a very cool concept because they allow you to regenerate the keys later based on a memorized phrase.  These are dangerous because if you can think them up, chances are a computer can invent them too - and there are computers that just check everything possible to see if there is money it it..  
But if you pick something big enough and long enough and convoluted enough you probably could be able to build something relatively safe though..  My thought is to use 8 generations of 2 different (Obscscure) geneologies with Birth years run through some math formula (the year 1808*15-11 for example) or something and odd capitalization patterns.  Then add some other unrelated passage of text.  The chances of anyone discovering something like that are slim..  Whatever you build you have to get exactly right when you want to recover the money. every peice of capitalization and every space different will generate a completely different address than the one you want.. 
The other issue would be the state of bitcoin in 20 years.. It may be the world's currency by then.  or it might be gone - replaced by something better..  It is still a "don't invest more than you want to lose" type venture..

Goverments have a strong incentive to build short term stability.  So they can get through the next election.   
As a result they implement bad policy, in the short term with the promise of fixing everything 4 or 8 years out.   Of course 4 or 8 years later they pass new policy that builds short term stability and promises to fix everything 4 or 8 years out..
Generally we would be better off to put up with the ups and downs in the short term than to experience the inevitable economic collapse that bad policy will inevitably produce long term.
So taking the monopoly on the control of money out of the goverment's hands is a good thing..  Bitcoin will not replace fiat money, but it will make the central bankers behave themselves..  If you run your money badly, folks will flock to Bitcoin instead, and you can't touch them there.

Multi-sig wallets reqire two or more signatures to transmit the bitcoin.

There are not enough facts disclosed to do anything more than an educated guess. I can't make it work. I have taken into account theoretical cashflows in and out. BT has been asked how it works, and they have declined to make a meaningful comment.  
Instead the promised an third party audit, but when the third party audit results where not satisfactory, they declined to release it.  That speaks loudly.
BT runs on Ponzi software, it pays ponzi rates, when asked about how their business model works they give ponzi style gibberish answers.  It could be something else, but not likely.  
Most of the customers at this point know it is a ponzi.  They are just biting their tongue hoping that it lasts long enough that they can get their money back.  Denial is profitable, and excuse making and keeping the faith until the next sucker is on the hook instead of you is potentially profitable.   
The fact BT is failing to make their payments proves my point.

Yep.  They pay what they say they pay.  
I am not sure they do what they say they do.  Mining payout seems high compared to what mining should be paying.  The "trading results" do seem to correspond with market conditions, but that is easy to do.
Could be real, could be a scam, but it isn't way too good to be true, just slightly too good to be true.  The terms of service are such that they could disapear and you would have no recourse.  They also could lose 3 percent per day, and investment locked for 120 days, that would eat up everyone's money pretty fast.  Thus far they have only reported 3 down days.  But there isn't a reason a wall street computer couldn't kill all arbitrage opportuniteis..  Or such a story could be built to kindly explain the money going away.

I suspect both will exist..  
Fiat is failing in much of the world.  Where it fails, what is failing will be replaced with what is an effective alternative.   Bitcoin is an effective alternative that is easily accessible to most folks, and is becoming more accessible all of the time.
As the network effect of Bitcoin grows, it's advantages over fiat will grow as well..  The main reason we use fiat is because of habit.   Not too many folks ride horses and buggies anymore though.. If there is a safer and more efficient method to transmit value, no matter what it is, it will likely be done.  Old habits die.  
@_date: 2014-04-05 04:54:13
Here is the thing.  
Bitcoin is a new internet technology.  We can look at the patterns of adoption of other techologies.  Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Amazon, etc.   Most likely it will either have exponential growth or it will MySpace and die.   
Because there is a fixed amount of bitcoin.  If exponential adoption happens, increased demand with a fixed supply means that the price will rise.   A ton.    Because it really doesn't matter which decimal point we use to purchase goods and services,  Increased price will do very little to hamper demand or functionality..  
So the upside is huge.   The downside is Zero.   I think that everyone with a bit of faith in Bitcoin oughta have a toe in the water..   But with the understanding that it could be zero, or it could be a million.   Don't put in more than you are willing to lose.
If exponential adoption happens we are looking at prices we can only guess at.  5k? 10K 100k? 500k  1 million?  I have seen them all.  Nobody knows.    Buying at  400 vs 800 probably is going to seem like a debate over investing a nickle or a dime..  Don't sweat the price..

If the miners choose not to mine, no real loss.   The bitcoin pundits will have to say "bigger than the 250 biggest super computers" instead of 500.  
More miners may make the network slightly more secure,  but it already many many magnitudes bigger than anyone would contemplate building to corrupt the system.  
Mining makes bitcoins, but more miners don't make more bitcoins and less miners don't make less bitcoins.

Bitcoin is like cash.  Cash transactions are advantageous because they are anonymous and final.  If somebody steals your cash, it really isn't much different.  If your bills show up at a convenience store 2 or 4 transactions later, you have no valid claim to it.  Craigslist and the like wouldn't exist without cash and therefore consumers that enjoy that market benefit from it, just like the vendors who use that market benefit from it.   
Bitcoin has much of the same strengths and weaknesses of cash - but it has the added benefit of being instantly transmittable worldwide.  Therefore it opens even more markets

1.  It is a free country, and banning possession of things is kinda hard -- The burden of proof is on those who feel it is harmful..
2. the code is good enough as shown by the stability of the system.  There is a lot of incentive to hack it, and nobody has been terribly successful yet..  
3.  The market needs to mature before you will be able to sell millions of dollars worth of bitcoin without driving the market down..  It will happen though, assuming all goes as it seems like all should go..
I am not sure miners "Centrallize power"  Basically a mining pool is like a lottery pool.   Winning a mining block is nearly as likely as winning the lottery..  So all the miners agree to share the winnings so that they can pay thier bills more than once every 100 years or so that they actually solve a block..  They still do the same problems in the same way, and the "power" still remains in the math.
Bitcoin doesn't need to be an everyday every person thing in order to be successful.   It has strengths and weaknesses as a payment mechanism.  It ought to thrive in some places, 
and not compete in others..  It's most appealing feature is that it is agnostic of international foundries..   Other systems require a lot of expensive middlemen to transmit value from one currency to another.  This one doesn't.. That simplifies transactions massively and opens up a ton of markets to third world vendors..

The FIFO thing would apply if we treat Bitcoin as Fungilbe, but it really isn't.  I suspect that the wallet software will be smart enought to keep track of the basis of every input in your wallet and treat it as a speratate asset. That will eliminate the need for fifo, as you will use actual basis rather than trying to guestimate.
FIFO is the best guess of most professionals because they don't understand the details of bitcoin.  
Software will optimize our spending to the tax code in short order. That is what is really cool about the bitcoin ecosystem.

I suspect multi-sig will be mainstramed rather quickly and wallet providers will make a user friendly experience.  
It isn't there yet.  Not even close.  Many of my single sig wallets reject my multisig addresses as invalid.   Its got a ways to go.  
Multisig will make Bitcoin massively safer, and as a result, it will be part of what mainstreams Bitcoin.  If a malware steals my key but also has the burden of stealing a corresponding key (likely held by a company with solid network security experts on staff) it becomes a lot less profitable to steal BTC.  
Multi sig is a game changer but the game is not changed yet.

The price of bitcoin is determined by supply and demand, not "what mynameisGoxxy thinks it should be."   There is only so much out there, and if you want it you have to pay what somebody is willing to part with it for.  Because supply is rather fixed, as more people use it, the price will rise.  It really is basic economics.   
The price is irrelevant, because it really doesn't matter what decimal point we use to send our transactions in.    
The fact that it is worth 600 bucks a coin is a very good argument against your contention that it will be zero.

Until there is a competent Bitcoin media that doesn't work for shrill payments, they are going to be a dime a dozen.
  I think a lot of people are used to having banks because we live in a centralized world.  You enter the decentralized world and people look for a place to put their money..  
You make a pretty enough website, and people will trust it -- until they learn their lesson the hard way a few times.. 
I suspect most all "investment" opportunities within the bitcoin space are fraudulent in the end.  If the investment opportunity was really good, there is not shortage of VC waiting to get into the bitcoin space -- There is no need to let every Tom, Dick or Harry invest in your project unless it isn't very legitimate..  There is a lot more overhead required to pay back 10,000 20 dollar loans than one 200,000 dollar loan.  
Binary options:  You get 180 percent back if you win, and 0 percent back if you lose..  
Cloud mining.   Mining is a fixed pie.   25 coins per block.  The more shares you sell the more ways the pie must be sliced..  If mining was a good deal, why would you sell/lease your miners to others?  Just run them yourself..  Good chance a lot of these operations are actually Ponzi..

Bitcoin transmits nearly instantly.   Confirmations take an average of 10 minutes.   Different companies have different policies on how many confirmations they wait until they trust that the transaction is good.  Usually zero is plenty (Unless somebody is trying to rip you off)  One is more than sufficient,  but there is a lot of "The most paranoid security policy is the best policy"  in Bitcoin, so it is not unusual to see companies require 6 confirmations.  
@_date: 2014-09-10 17:15:42
There are no economies of scale in Bitcoin mining.   So no matter how many miners there are, and no matter how much is invested, pretty much the exact same amount of bitcoin is produced..
Bitcoin is unique in this way.  If you build a bigger TV factory for example,  You will most likely be able to make 10k TV's at a cheaper price per unit than you would if you made 1k tvs.  Bitcoin will always be released at the rate it will be released and no amount of mining will make the supply more abundant than it is going to be.
As a result there is a set number of Bitcoin.  Supply is rather fixed.  As price is effected by supply and demand, if supply doesn't change,  increased demand is going to yield increased price.  
Bitcoin is inflationary right now and for many years to come -- This means that the adoption rate needs to be exponential for demand to outpace supply.  If it is adopted exponentially, as most successful internet technologies have been, we could see "to the moon prices"  (Or maybe today's prices are already to the moon)

If you don't include transactions you do not collect the fees included with the transactions..   Probably not a huge deal right now, but it will become a bigger deal as time goes on.
There is no pre-mining.  You can only mine and withhold your block -  and the longer you hold your block the bigger risk somebody else will submit a solution that makes your block useless.    The point of submitting a zero transaction is that you get you block in faster than anybody else who solved at the same time but took a few milliseconds longer to transmit.

You type in the address of the person you want to send money to, and you type in the amount that you want to send them.  You then press send, and the software you are sending with signs your order with some cryptography that proves you are the owner of your wallet..

Because I am not.  
I am not opposed to regulation.  What these guys where doing should be illegal.
But it IS.  They had no securities license.  There is no grey area that they where thriving in.  Even if this was an 'arbitrage service" and not a ponzi,  They where blatantly and indisputably not compliant with US law.  That is one reason they claimed to be based out of Panama.  (Even though they probably weren't to any measurable degree)  
So adding one more layer of regulation to make these guys more illegal will be a burden on normal everyday bitcoin entrepreneurs who are not criminals, and will not make one iota of difference in the minds of the criminals.   
There just isn't anything more financially illegal than a Ponzi Scheme -- Yet you have a whole industry based around creating and running them.. There are hundreds of them.  (most of them outside the bitcoin ecosystem).  Bitlicense isn't going to make them go away any more than the rest of the law..

Perhaps it isn't so much being held back so much as it is a rapidly growing technology that isn't growing in the direction or method that many of it's fans desire for it to grow..
Price in particular isn't necessarily a good growth metric, yet some folks think the price needs to be through the moon for it to be a "success".  1200 was the moon.   Perhaps there will be another one, but the truth is reduced volatility will be a much better sign of maturity than a high price will be.

If you don't hold the keys, you don't control the coin and you are trusting whoever does --
There are some trustworthy parties out there.  It does make sense for exchanges, for example, to borrow your bitcoin and rent it out to people who want to short bitcoin.  
But it also makes a lot of sense to Ponzi or steal your bitcoin outright - and that is a hugely popular business right now..  
Bitcoin really is an investment in itself.   If you buy one bitcoin at 325 today it is is likely to be worth somewhere between 50 and 2000 dollars in a year.   Are you seriously worried about getting 6%?   Seems like a rather silly proposition when you think of it that way..

I think this statement is fairly inaccurate -- There are some bitcoin advocates way up in the Russian central banking system..  The problem is that it is a double edged sword.  It removes control from the Fed and the USD, but it also reduces their control over their own people..

People pick prices according to the market.   If Coins are selling for 300, why would you sell yours for less..  It does look like there have been a few sales below 300, but the are snatched up instantly and the 300 price resumes.  There are people asking for more than 300 and those orders will be filled after all those for sale at 300 are gone..  
If a bigwig wants out this is the way to do it.. Otherwise they will drive the price through the floor.  Doing it this way, they drive it to 300..

More miners do nothing but burn electricity.  In short, there are way more now than are needed.  If there where 10% as many the same number of coin would be mined and the same number of blocks would be confirmed..

Latest update from Thomas Opperman PR guy from Bitcoin trader:
Here are the facts we have at this stage :
1 - John Carley was supposed to make an announcement over the weekend. The last time any BT staff heard from him was on Saturday morning when he told us that his announcement would be later the same day.
2- There was a typhoon in the area where John was likely to be. This could be a reason for his lack of communication,but we do not know this for a fact.
3- The server had problems and has been restored. There are still a few updates we need to do.
4- Some site maintenance
5- Michaela Juric-Donlan has released a document with "evidence" that BT is solely for the purpose of laundering money. This you can take as you see fit and it is open to interpretation. I would just like to inform you that Michaela has her own agenda for doing so,and it might be good to point out that she has her own website where she also does btc investments. She is trying to get as much public exposure as possible in order to become a bitcoin "celebrity". The faster she can build a name for herself as the only honest person in crypto currency the more people will trust her investment.
6- Mike Walker and Andrea Ciceri have been an invaluable part of our team and have done more than their part in marketing BT and raising btc awareness. They are our best reps,but that is all they are. They have no inside info into the workings or management of BT. To harass them for info would be a waste of time.Rob Drover is an investor and helped us as admin on this group only. He has no other connection to BT.
7- There has been people who have been able to complete cashouts. This only works for Pexpay it seems.Due to all the server and site issues and maintenance some functions on the site has been disabled or are not working correctly.
This whole fiasco has been a coincidence of badly timed events.We had no control over the server crash and the effects thereof. With this happening and Michaela knowing that John would be hard to reach after she tried to blackmail him, they started their FUD attack and the technical problems just helped her along as an unexpected reason to further cause panic.And with all this happening John disappears without a trace after promising an update.
We have sponsored the Kryptoz car that is still running till November and haven't even started the final leg yet. We have a lot of events that are coming up during the rest of the year for which we have already paid deposits and made arrangements. There are a lot of things that are now just left hanging in the air until John has come back to take control of the situation.
We apologize for the past week and we understand your concern. There is nothing we can do about it until John Carley returns. We will keep you updated with news on the situation,but both Michael Brandenburg , Jonathan Moloney and myself will not take part in any discussions or speculation about this.

Coinbase has most of the biggest Vendor contracts  (Dell, overstock etc)   I suspect there is no shortage of coin most of the time.
The rumor is that they are blocking folks that frequently send money to gambling sites that potentially violate US law.   I think it is wise not to pay any sites from your coinbase or circle wallets -instead send them to yourself in a wallet outside their control..  I suspect the folks who are marked suspicious are not doing that..  
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:35:18
I think there is a belief that as the floodgates open and more and more vendors accept Bitcoin, they will immediately turn them to cash increasing supply thus drive prices down.  
There may be some lag between the time that vendors accept bitcoin and more non techie consumer adoption.  In this window it is not unlikely that prices will fall a bit.

1. If you are in the US, Circle, coinbase, or localbitcoins.
2. Where you store you bitcoins depends on different factors -- Typically I keep 20 or so bucks in a kryptokit extension wallet browser for tipping and quick payments  I keep 50 or 70 dollars on my phone in case I find a brick and mortar merchant that will take my BTC or I want to re-imburse a friend..  My savings I save on paper wallets with a couple copies hidden in my office and my house.  --  Those are rather hack proof.. 
3.  Bitstamp seems okay.  BTC-E seems kinda shady -- Unless you want to be a day trader or something there really isn't a huge advantage of using them over something like Circle..
4. Circle or coinbase will buy them from you and deposit the money in your bank account a day or two later--  You can also buy gift cards from GYFT or the like if you need to spend them someplace.

Yes, some people prefer BTC to credit cards...  But those who are used to credit cards are not going to rush out and buy bitcoin to pay Dell.  That is my point..
Bitcoin is ideal for the type of transaction I describe -- And when Bitcoin is embraced by newspapers and other "small media" type transactions, it will give the rest of the world a reason to buy Bitcoin..  (Because it costs 30 cents to make a 50 cent transaction on Visa)

Try the Kryptokit wallet, for holding small balances for tipping on the web etc.   It is really fun to pay with two clicks...  Don't put more than chump change in there though..
Put big balances on paper wallets so you don't have to worry about them getting hacked..  
Put 2 factor authentication on everything you can -- especially your emails.  The fact that you have bitcoin makes you a richer target -- and if they can break into your email account they can reset most any web password you have..

The Bank knowing I bought a Dell isn't a terrible concern for me.  Visa protects against fraud - so I don't worry about the card number being stolen -- That is their problem and it happens often enough that it is built into their business model.

In general, computer people, and especially computer programmers ignore certain inconvenient facets of reality and expect reality to conform to the world as they have formed it in their minds..
Bitcoin raises the stakes on this in that Bitcoin in and of itself ignores reality and continues doing what it is doing, no matter what anyone thinks about it.  That is the nature of the creation. It doesn't matter what any regulator says or does, Bitcoin is going to be Bitcoin, and it isn't going to change because of the opinion of anyone.  (With a few small exceptions)  
So we have built a technology that forms a parallel universe in which the existing universe will either conform or be left behind with their rotory phones and fax machines..  And if it is only us that live in this new universe, well, this is the only universe that matters, right?

Print it on printer.  That is really hard to hack.
You can send Bitcoin over the internet, and you really cannot with real money..   You can use visa or mastercard or the like - but at an expense -  and with Centralization -- Which is what you are complaining about...
  These centralized services (non bitcoin companies)  get hacked all of the time and leak your visa numbers, usernames, password etc. like crazy.   Not only that but they sell your data to other third parties so that they can market to you and take advantage of you..   Insurance does cover you for some of those things  (outright visa fraud)  but it doesn't do much about leaking our name, address, passwords, buying history, etc..  
Part of the reason personal bitcoin accounts are hacked is because our favorite Usernames and passwords are all over TOR because people hacked them from centralized servers..
So bitcoin moves everything towards decentralization, which solves most of the privacy issues..   People hack servers because that is where the data is..  Once you reduce the need for the data, and more importantly decentralize the data, there will not be data to hack..
Storj, Maidsafe etc.  Will solve the security issues..
Just like with Cash, only carry what you are likely to spend on your PC -- Pretend it is your leather wallet..  You probably don't carry 30K in your wallet.  Keep large amount of bitcoin in the bank.. (a paper wallet with multiple copies stashed away)  
Bitcoin isn't mature yet.   It is getting there.  And it will prevail eventually  (or something like it)  Dabble with it as much as you feel comfortable..  In the western world I doubt it will outright replace currency.  It will be really handy for some transactions, and those transactions will make it really useful.

I wish the tippers did a better job of it, quite frankly.  if you are tipping a non-bitcoiner it would be best to make it a dollar or so, so at least it is worth their time.

Bitcoin isn't as good of a deal for consumers as it is for vendors.  Chargebacks are a consumer's friend and a vendor's enemy.  Most of the vendors who have started accepting Bitcoin are those with High priced items, that need to be shipped..
Digital media is the sweet spot where it is good for consumers.  If I want to watch a video.  Clicking Kryptokit and pressing pay is a ton easier than entering a username, password, credit card number etc etc etc..  When you have to go through that much rigmarole to read a magazine article or a newspaper article, you just won't bother..  
So,  Paypal in targeting digital media products is pushing Bitcoin into the sweet spot where it benefits both the consumer and the vendor.

3.  It isn't a one size fits all solution -- try to get the pamphlet into the hands of businesses that are the best fit for Bitcoin.  
4. Visa is making everyone upgrade their POS systems before 2016..

That was an initial hypothesis that was circulating at the beginning.
And that hypothesis is what Todd was refuting when he said that the operator of Satoshi's account forwarded him an email from earlier.  
If you have access to an mailbox, you also have access to it's sent mail folder.   How does that prove you had access at a particular date years ago?   
I don't think there is evidence of this account being hacked prior to the last few days.  If you have some, I would love to see it.
I suspect the hacker found some Satoshi credentials in one of the many hack databases being circulated for sale right now, then reverse engineered his way into more and more accounts (Using the verification questions etc)  Once you get an email account it is easy to reset all kinds of passwords.

Big vendors (Dell, Newegg, expedia, dish) are accepting bitcoin and trading it daily for USD..  This means there are more sellers in the market than there where a few months ago..  
Consumers are not adopting Bitcoin quite as fast at Vendors.  (It is a really good deal for vendors, but it is only great for consumers in particular transactions)
I suspect that eventually consumer adoption will catch up with vendor acceptance, but I suspect the price is rational either way..

I supspect that service providers like Coinbase don't really leak --  They just buy less BTC off the excnages and buy it from their vendors and sell it to their customers.  Kinda hard to track that.

It technically isn't centralized--  anyone can run a ripple daemon  -- although there really isn't an incentive to do it, so it hasn't spread like bitcoin mining does..  
Ripple creates markets for various gateway assets rather automatically -- That is really what it is excellent at --  You can rather instantly trade your Bitcoin at Bitstamp for Japanese Yen, USD, or another currency at any other Ripple gateway.   Really you are just trading IOU's though - redeemable through whatever gateway issued them..   
It isn't the easiest thing to understand but more or less you have networks of trust lines -- and If I have a trusted  friend that has Japanese yen and you have a trusted friend that has litecoin, and we trust one another,  and "allow rippling"  Your friend can trade my friend Litecoin for yen - and you an I will transparently get offsetting debits and credits --  passing the transaction kinda like AC current through a social media network..   That's my understanding anyway -- They don't go out of their way to explain it to consumers.   
I believe Ripple labs has 60 or so employees - including former big bankers and finance ministers --  I also believe they have all of the paperwork needed to be legit and their aim is to be legit -- That's why they don't want to be bothered by pesky hobbiests like most bitcoiners -- But because it is an open network it is open to the hobbiests too --  Just not very well explained..

What do you expect Bitcoin to succeed at?  I don't think even Bitcoin has that figured out yet.  
I think there is a tendency to define success as something like "replace fiat currency"  But that isn't really the goal. It could only handle the porn transactions on the web, and that is a pretty massive chunk of change. 
If it takes off with the teenagers on their smartphones, it can be successful for the next several decades with or without grandma's participation.  
But yes. It needs to get easier.  It really is in the same phase as the internet was prior to the invention of the web browser.  It worked. It was powerful.  It changed the landscape of a lot of things particularly in academia.   But if you didn't know your way around a unix command line it seemed weird and unwieldy.   It will get better.

Also remember most vendors have a agreement with Bitpay or Coinbase that assures them of receiving their money.  It really isn't any different from the Visa deal you talk about.

Why not use bitcoin?  I click on cryptokit, enter my amount. click send, done. Yah, I could use other technologies, but why?  Bitcoin works and it is WAY faster.  
If I send money via paypal I have to enter a password.  They get a message that gives away a bit of my identity etc.  Nothing wrong with doing it that way, just bitcoin is faster, and more informal.  Often you want to do a trade, not enter into a permanent Customer\Client relationship.  Bitcoin works the same was as cash in it's etherialness.  Transaction is done, and the relationship is finished till next time.    
It could got to zero, if the network collapsed or the like.  Seems unlikely considering the massive amount of  Venture Capital and all that is being poured into it's success.  It has proven itself to be quite resilient, in spite of the obituaries in the paper every month or two. Even in the worst case, it is unlikely to get all the way there though.. It will have collector value if nothing else.

Bitpay has been accepting 0 conf transactions for years without issues.  Many wallets now monitor propagation over the network.  Once the vast majority of the nodes are aware of the transaction the likelyhood of a double spend hitting a node that is not aware becomes quite unlikely.

I don't think it is doubling down your reward.   Bitcoin has a the potential to earn you -100 to +5000%.   Any legitimate investment will probably earn you 6% per year..    So on the upside you are probably going to get 5006% instead of 5000%.
The problem comes if any of your investment companies hold USD denominated assets as reserves.  Bitcoin goes from 400 to 1200 and suddenly you are in a Mt Gox situation where the numbers just cannot add up. All their liabilities are in Bitcoin at 1200 but many of their assets are in USD at 400.   This shouldn't happen, but based on the number of exchanges, "Arbitrage services (really Ponzi's)" and other 'bitcoin investments" that go under week after week,  I conclude it happens all of the time.

For the last year I have been attacked for spreading FUD about Bitcoin-trader.biz.   "NO PROOF!" they claimed   "SLANDER!"   "We will do an audit someday soon"   Some FUD is worthy of listening to.   Namely, "Be very careful in sending your bitcoin to third parties."
It's the truth.  Like I said they are innocent until proven guilty, and that is usually happens when the take off with everyone's money...
The Bitcoin philosophy is to remove centralized third parties wherever possible.   Exchanges do not have a very good track record as a category.  The biggest one ran off with everyone's money..   Decentralized solutions are coming for exchanges too -- and not too soon.   
Feel free to invest in whatever you want... I really don't care what you do with your coin.  You are free to trust it to whomever you think is worth trusting..  But It isn't FUD to warn others that Bitcoin investing is a VERY risky landscape right now -- probably more scams than legit operators.

If a credit card can be reported stolen 6 weeks later would a brick and mortar store make the customer wait 6 weeks before taking the TV?  
If Bitpay or coinbase is willing to guarantee it, the store will not need to accept the risk.  
And I suspect that will be the case, knowing the mathematics, Bitpay will guarantee it when the math is solid.  
If zero confirmation scams where a real likelyhood they would happen all of the time to bitpay, yet there is no evidence of such attacks being successful.   One confirmation is only another layer of mathmatics that moves the chances of a transaction being included in a block from a calculable very high percentage to a slightly higher 100 percent..

I tend to agree, sorta.  
Gox did insert a artifical price into the equation, And that probably did prevent the other exchanges from straying too far.  I don't know that this was intentional manipulation - just a broken market is going to give you broken prices.  So in a sense, this is true.
The downward prices are due to uncertaintly in China, and grousing about the IRS "paperwork' in the US..  In prior weeks news has been overwelmingly negative.

Shorting actually prevents rapid declines in price..   Because in order to take your profits you must buy back the loaned asset and return it to it's owner.  Thus it leads to more stablity, not less.  
ETF's will help the price because it will make it accessible to you via your regular brokerage houses - Thus it could option in your IRA, 401k etc.  State Pension funds etc could invest in it, as it has outperformed gold and other hedges in recent years, they likely would want to.

The better wallets give you a different address every time you press the "request money"  Wallets are free to make, and are less traceable when you use a new one for every transaction.

The primary advantage is privacy.   When you hand over your card you also hand over your name, address etc etc..  When you send bitcoin, it is like cash.   
There are also security advantages..  -- Although Visa insures you against fraud, (At a cost that requires higher prices on the products you purchase)  the fraudster still gets all of the info mentioned above, and could theoretically use it for more social engineering attacks to steal your identity at a later date.  
Much of the world doesn't credit or banking like we do in the western world - Bitcoin is an improvement over what they use.    For us westerners,  it really isn't much of an improvement over visa for what we usually use visa for.

Within seconds of a bitcoin transaction being transmitted the risk of it not being included in a block drops to near nil.  There is next to no chance of me not receiving the bitcoins...  BitPay has been excepting Zero confirmations transactions for well over a year now and has never reported a double spend taking their money...  
Here's how:    Unless you can demonstrate mathmatically that the article is incorrect,  your are just believing and repeating a common inaccurate FUD talking point.. 
On your Visa  comments -- Not quite.   That assumes that the party presenting the credit card is the legitimate owner of the credit card and not an impostor.. If the card is reported stolen, They can charge back - particularly if I cannot prove I checked ID and singatures etc..

I will take a guess because I think I understand it and want an expert to correct me if I am wrong.  
The public key is related to the private key..  With no transactions there are zero clues, and it would be insanely hard to guess the one from another.    When you sign a transaction, it leaves a clue.  Still a really bad clue.  Something along the lines of the private key is 1,234,137 miles from the public key.  If you sign another transaction with it you get another equally bad clue..  For each additional transaction you get another bad clue -- but if you look at them all together you can triangulate out a somewhat decent guess.  Not a very good guess, but not a "more than molecules in the known world" sized guess.   Since it wouldn't really take any effort to move your money to another wallet, you are much safer to just do that..

It is going to be used how it is going to be used.   The fact that people use it makes it more popular than when people don't use it.  How it is used doesn't matter as much as the fact that people find it useful.
It doesn't help the price,  but that's okay.   There is no law saying the price must be crazy high.  
Right now, I don't think it has found it's niche.  People use it because they want to - not because it is the best way in most cases.   It ought to be really good for international travel.  It ought to be really good for pay-per-view media and digital media.  Buying a Dell?  Probably something you could do just as easy with a visa..  But whatever floats your boat..

I don't think there is a real advantage in ordering mail order with Bitcoin.   It works.  It's easy.  It's safe.   But you are going to have to enter Name, address and a whole bunch of other stuff anyway, so there is no huge time savings or privacy benefit...  Charge-backs are a big benefit for consumers..  I would use a Visa..
Bitcoin would be ideal for more trivial things - like pay-per view on internet, or subscriptions or donations --  Things where you don't want to fill out a form and give you life's story away.   Just drop 2 quarters in the slot and the transaction is done..

In most "real" bitcoin wallets, you can do that without issue.  
If you are using a "fake" wallet from a broker (like Circle) be careful-- Often when you press "pay" they pay the wallet you tell them to pay - but out of Circle's wallet, not yours..     If the recipient sends money back, it will not go to you.

Depends on what government you are trusting.  See Cyprus...  
I think the idea of Bitcoin as a replacement for fiat money is premature at this point, at least in most of the Western world.   It still has maturing to do.  But that maturing is happening very quickly.  
If you are not ready, don't use it.   Bitcoin is not a sure-fire investment by any stretch of the imagination...   But it is going to change the landscape of the world over the next 7 or 8 years.  If you want to be ahead of the curve, play at least a little bit --  If you don't care about that, it probably isn't for you.  Yet.

I didn't say they where ponzi.   
Most Bitcoin investments end up either ponzi or 'hacked'  (usually really just stolen by an insider) in the end.  The ones that haven't probably will..   Gavin Andressen suggested most of the 'cloud mining' operations out there are ponzi..  That is a TON of scam..
This one doesn't smell too ponzi to me.   It isn't too good to be true.   Therefore, it probably is inconsequential.   
I warn people about investment schemes because that is the way that people get ripped off.  That is what makes it into the news.  That is why people don't trust bitcoin.   Bitcoin is risky enough without adding a third party that is subject to internal or external theft, Government seizure etc...  Those are the things Bitcoin is intended to liberate us from..  
Why would we evangelize people buy bitcoin so they can throw it right back into the hands of centralized trusted third parties?

Yah, I guess I just don't understand your idea at all.  You haven't explained it well enough.  
The price rises and falls because of supply and demand.  Yes, somebody could demand enough that they cornered the market and set the floor price,  but only until they sold all of their bitcoin.  And if anyone else wanted to sell their bitcoin fast they would have to sell below that floor price.  
Price stability is a good thing if it has naturally evolved.  it is not such a good thing if it is manipulated by a market player.

There is a big tendency to make it an "either/or" question.  The answer is both.   Just like in the real world there are places where it is easier to use cash and there are places where it is easier to use credit cards..   In the past there was no cash option for the internet, now there is.  Use it where it works, don't use it where something else works better.  
If you are doing small transactions on the internet Bitcoin through Kryptokit is two clicks to pay where most other methods include filling out a much long form.

It is a bad habit.   Leaving your balances in something like Coinbase, Circle, or Coinapult is basically like putting your money in a bank.  These companies are most likely solvent, and are not likeyl to be run like Mt. Gox,  but you miss out on one of the core elements of Bitcoin when you put it in a bank.  The whole point is that you don't need a bank..  You ought not need trust anyone..

Seems to me that one of the issues with Bitcoin it's features tend to be nicer for the receiver than they are for the sender in most cases.  (Irreversibility, low fees etc)

Just so you know, the controversy about this post is because there is a contingent within the Bitcoin camp that believes "The most paranoid policy is the best policy"  They might be right, they might be wrong, it's up to you to decide how paranoid you want to be..   
In Bitcoin, you don't have to trust any third party.  (Like Coinbase)  Some people believe because you don't have to you shouldn't.   But Bitcoin is about freedom,  so if you choose to trust them, you may do so freely, and ignore the people who mock you for it.  
Coinbase likely has IT staff focused 100% of security.  They likely have some insurance.  You probably don't.  So there is some benefit to trusting them..  The question is do you trust them more than you trust yourself. 
There have not been a lot of trustworthy players in the bitcoin space.  Coinbase could be run by crooks, or incompetent people. I don't get that vibe, but some would rather not take chances with anyone.  
I myself save bitcoin I consider an 'investment" in paper wallets with a couple of copies hidden away in different geographic places (copy in my office and copy in my home)  Paper is really hard to hack.  I put a moderate amount of spending money in a wallet on my phone (Breadwallet) and a small amount in a Kryptokit browser (for tipping and internet purchases).
I only use Circle or Coinbase when I am going to buy or sell.     
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:33:10
Bitcoin has been missing it's mark, on that.  
It would be ideal to do transactions like buying a newspaper from a newspaper machine.  Pay 75 cents.  Or "watch a streaming video your favorite college football team for 3 dollars" 
With something like Kryptokit, those transactions are two click operations.   Verses entering name, address, 16 digit CC number and CRC etc..  
That is a win- win because it saves the consumer hassle, and those type transactions are pretty expensive for the vendor on the Visa network..

There are legit reasons for wanting to do tumbling.   (Payroll for example -- You may not want your employees to trace how much you pay to who)  If that is your intent and it was legitimately earned money and it is legitimately received money and legitimately transmitted money then you aren't laundering - you are just paying in random doses through intermediaries.

You can get a package delivered via charter jet, if you want to spend the money, or you can use the USPS and it will still get to the same place.   Saying the "charter jet" sucks because the USPS is much cheaper isn't too accurate.

I would be reluctant to invest in much of anything in the Bitcoin universe.  Bitcoin is an investment in itself. Many of the "cloud mining" services are likely really Ponzi..  If it was really that profitable, they would be keeping the profit for themselves, not leasing it out to you..  It isn't hard to find credit that charges less than 12-18% per month.
All of these services are innocent until proven guilty, but they are proven guilty when they disappear with everyone's money.  (Like Bitcoin-Trader.biz the other week)

Bitcoin works for big purchases.  But it has advantages and disadvantages.  No points, no mediation on unwanted orders etc..  For consumers on big purchase items, it really isn't a slam dunk win..

Bitcoin is easier to trace than cash, but it is still pretty darn hard..  
If the other coins in the other wallet where not bought by you directly (and tracible) , there would be no way to know if this was your wallet or somebody else's .. You get plausible deniability at that point --  Then the Coinjoin stuff makes it even more diluted..  If somebody was survialing you PC and saw you trigger each of those transactions you could still be traced, but most of us aren't bugged by anyone except the NSA, and it is politically expedient that they not to show their hand too often..
The truth is that EVERYTHING is traceable, if you have enough other clues..  but nothing is obvious, if you take reasonable precautions.

It just needs to get safer and simpler to use.   It is getting closer every day.   
Regulatory uncertainty is also diminishing all of the time.  Many companies shy away from bitcoin because there are too many legal question marks.  "Do I need a Money transmitter licence?"  "Can I sell it to people without an SEC licence?" "How I am going to be taxed on it" These questions may seem kinda silly but getting them wrong can cost you thousands of dollars a day in fines.  So companies will wait till the rules are ironed out before they jump in.

How exactly is fiat money "Backed"?
The truth is its not.  What is the government going to do to prevent it from going down in value?  Nothing.   And if someone argues otherwise,  Why has it been going down in value for the last 100 years?  
The truth is fiat money isn't backed, it's hacked.   And Bitcoin cannot be hacked in that fashion..

I tend to think bottom up adoption has run it's course, and the top down adoption has begun..
In short there are only so many nerds..   Once the nerds have blazed the trail and proven the concept, businesses build products upon the technology and roll it out to their non-nerd consumer customers, and that is where the real adoption happens.   
If we want adoption to happen in mass, we need to develop products that use it inherently without user setup or intervention..

Why do we need to?
Bitcoin only needs to be an option to be successful. It's biggest advantage is online.  Instead of entering my name address phone, visa card etc etc etc.   I can click on cryptokit and press pay.  It would be nice if I could buy coffee and groceries with it, but If It is only used to buy newpaper articles, porn and online poker games, it is still functional as a payment method.  
It doesn't need to replace fiat currency.  It just needs to be enough of a competitor that the central banks know that if they misbehave people will have other options.  
People will adopt when the technology is mature.  It isn't.  Bitcoin is like 1993 internet.  It works. It's cool.  It's powerful, but if you don't know what you are doing, it is also way scary.  People never did adopt the 1993 internet.  They adopted the 2001 internet.  Lets not rush things.  Lets  not set goals and expectations higher than they need to be.  Lets not give up either -- As technology is improving very quickly..

Changetip is a way of introducing non-bitcoin users to bitcoin.   
For example I went though and found all of the "how to" youtube videos that had inspired me to build somethng and tipped the folks $1-5 in thanks.  They either accept my gift, and collect the changetip wallet, or they ignore it, and it goes back to me in a week..
So far 6 of the 9 dollars I put out there have been collected..  If those folks didn't know about Bitcoin before, they will probably look into it now.

Every hassle that Bitcoin faces is met with innovation and smart application of technology.
The truth of the matter is that this reporting requirement would be a massive hassle, except for the fact that it is all nicely databased in the blockchain, and most transactions happen on a computer network anyway.
Theoretically with a little cross referencing a wallet software could know the cost basis for every single input.  It could spend them in a tax optimized manner, and it could provide an nice 10,000 record report expaining it's math with very little difficulty..

I suspect the FIFO rule is for Fungible assests, which luckily, if we look carefully, Bitcoin really isn't..   A good wallet could keep a mathmatical ledger of the cost basis of every input available in our wallet.. It could spend them in a tax advantaged way..  And because we track actual costs for actual individual inputs, we wouldn't have to simplify into FIFO..  
I could be wrong, but I suspect not..

has been accusing my of slander because I believe BT is a ponzi...   
Here are some common features of Ponzi's  
*Daily returns of around 1%
*Investment lock-up period
*The company is registered in Panama
*Offer high referral commissions
*Anonymous owners (even though they claim to operate out of London)
*No proof of income generating activity
*Provide a link to a HYIP scripts website
Borrowed from 
If you look at they typical ponzi scheme and you look at Bitcoin trader.  The characteristics are the same..   Arbitrage forex trading is one of the most common Ponzi covers.. 
So when I say "all of the evidence points that way except wishful thinking"  That is what I mean..   Bitcoin trader shares 99.5 percent of the characteristics with they typical scam..  
It is their job, not mine, to prove that they are different.  I am not out of line to think "if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, it is most likely a duck"  
Their answer is fairly typical "But we have an new and advanced business, in a new market"    Every HYIP says they have a magical sauce that makes them different and more legit than all the scams that look just like them, but in the end  they all turn out how they turn out.. 
An audit that shows both solvency and actual arbitrage business activity may solve that, and meet their burden of proof..   It has been promised and not delivered..   
I suspect it will be inadequate.  But I could be wrong..  I warned bitcoin trader and the community months ago that it was going to be very difficult to prove liabilities, and that they ought to think that through with the audit.. Then they tell us "we got an audit back but we are not releasing it because it has a big disclaimer that says 'We couldn't confirm liabilities'"  
I am not a nut.  I am looking for reality, and I know what I see, and I know what I don't see..
I will put my record of admitted speculation up against Bitcoin-traders record of failed promises any day,  and I will win, hands down..

If it was really profitable they would take VC money, and have one or two investors to pay back instead of maintaining a massive database and marketing arm to recruit thousands of little guys..  With a VC the math needs to add up.  With thousands of little guys, plausibility  and group-think peer pressure gets their foot in your door, then you can schmooze them with imaginary profits until they love you..

I am pessimistic on Bitcoin's price in general..  I tend to think that now that it is being used rather than hoarded, there is almost always some for sale at market, thus it is hard for the price to rise much..
The GOP takeover will probably pour some hot water on the Fed..    The house has voted to audit them, and the senate has refused to take up the matter..   Good chance a GOP senate will vote to audit the Fed, and that may raise some light into just how flakey our monetary system really is..  In the long run that could only help bitcoin,   although by how much?  Hard to say - Adoption will probably grow either way.  So attributing it to any political reality will be hard.

Not as far up as people would think, but probably not down.  
The faster bitcoin moves, the less of it is needed to do the same amount of purchasing, because it can be used again and again and again.  
Demand would certainly go up - particularly when it isn't getting converted back to fiat every 3 transactions, but it wouldn't go up as far as people who live in the current "Buy and hoard" economy expect it to..

What happened to the VISA network when there where no more mining awards?
That's right, they never had them.   
The mining awards are not intended to be the point of mining.   The point of mining is to validate transactions.  Awarding blocks was a way to get the currency in circulation at a predictable rate.   
If other means of transaction can remain solvent without award blocks, there is no reason to believe that a mature bitcoin would be any different.

There are certain places where bitcoin thrives.   "Pay 3 dollars to watch your Idaho Vandal Football game" for example.  Or "pay 75 cents to get full access to today's newspaper"  aside from Private VPN subscriptions and Porn sites,  Bitcoin vendor adoption hasn't hit the places where it benefits the consumer as much as the vendor..  Widespread adoption will allow the sweet spots to be found...  
Unless there is a discount involved, I don't see a big advantage in using Bitcoin over Visa to buy a Dell for example..  I am going to give them all my contact info anyway, so privacy issues are nil.

Really it comes down to Supply and Demand.  There is a relatively fixed supply.  If the demand exceeds supply, the price will go up.   If the demand is less than supply the price will go down.  
Supply is mathematically fixed and totally rational.   Demand probably not so much --  But it doesn't need to be correct to matter.   Most internet tech is adopted Exponentially --  If Bitcoin follows the same curve -- Price will likely increase because of the laws of supply and demand..
Bitcoin should be incredibly price elastic --  It doesn't matter an iota what decimal place we buy our coffee with -- So increase in price ought not effect demand as much as demand effects price..
I do think many people underestimate the velocity component however --  Because of the lack of friction bitcoin can be spent over and over and over and over again rather quickly -- and as such we don't need as much of it to buy the same amount of stuff..   So as long as it moving and being used -- Use isn't going to drive the price up nearly to the same extent that hoarding does --  There are alway vendors putting bitcoin up for sale for fiat - at market - and until those orders are filled - the price doesn't rise..  
So will it go to the moon?  Maybe.  but how high is the moon?  1200 was a pretty good moon number..  So you could argue it has already been..

Whatever you use has to be expensive.   
It needs to be prohibitively expensive to game the system.  Your investment must give you stake in the success of the system.
Proof of work seems wasteful on the face of it.  But the traditional banking system is massively more expensive, because you need massively expensive bureaucracies to do the same thing simple math does in Bitcoin.  
In the end, the mining pool will only be as big as it needs to be -- mining isn't terribly profitable in the end, so it won't be  more wasteful than necessary..

Any trusted central authority is a point of possible corruption.  Unfortunately the technology for decentralization is not mature enough yet to do away with entirely yet.  
Coinbase, Circle, Kraken disappear,  we at least know who to sue..  BTC-E not so much..  But then again we lose substantial privacy doing business with regulated businesses.

Bitcoin isn't out to replace every other kind of possible means of transaction..  It is a way to pay.  Sometimes it is the best way, sometimes it is a cumbersome way.

Really I think the crux of the issue is that there are only a few banks that transmit money overseas - and they charge the smaller banks a hefty toll to do it --  Ripple has the potential to bypass this toll and allow bank to bank transfers without the intermediary gateways..

It will probably block most of the new ones from desiring to try to boostrap a new blockchain.  Why try to boostrap your own when you can leverage off of an established and rather invincible one that already exists..   
As more people get into CryptoCurrencies and more and more equipment exists starting a blockchain from scratch becomes harder..  Starting one on SHA256 is probably impossible, as there is just too much discarded mining power laying around, and 51% attacks could be done fairly cheaply..

It is kinda a silly question in that very few governments seem to be considering such a thing.  
Bitcoin isn't really bannable - Governments have to adapt to the reality of it's existence, for the most part they are.

I was thinking today that Cash is just a very primitive database that keeps track of value that we have available to trade with one another.  
If we look at cash as a database, Bitcoin makes a ton more sense.  Cash has no security - it requires physical manipulation to query or exchange..  Bitcoin does the same job, but with all the newfangled bells and whistles that make data electronically usable.

Could go that way --- I kinda think the initial step however is building a infrastructure to prevent Denial of Service or spam..   If micropayment tolls are required (And perhaps even refunded)  you can make spam usages very expensive while keeping legit uses very cheap..
Eventually this could evolve into a system where you can make important economic activity buy more reliable service then just everyday traffic..  All in all - so long as the free market is at play this is good for consumers..   Government sanctioned monopolies rarely work out beneficial because the competition is prevented from entry.

Most people know nothing about bitcoin.   
The question isn't "how do I pay"  the question is "What is this bitcoin stuff?  Why do you bother taking it?  Isn't it mostly for drugs and money laundering? etc etc etc."   All good talking points, but if you are in the business of running a deli, you are in the business of selling sandwiches, not bitcoin...
The confirmation time was already addressed elsewhere in the thread.  
If I run a business, I make my decisions based on "how much business is this going to bring in"   and the answer is "not much"  Yes, I may save 3% on the .5% that actually pay with Bitcoin, but that isn't worth the effort.

I didn't promise success.   That just seems like the most likely outcome..  It has already happened to some extent.
All internet technologies are met with skepticism and most of them prevail to mainstream usage..  Bitcoin is even more likely to succeed because it has a economic benefit unlike the other technologies..   Sending 140 byte telegraphs to the world or sharing cat photos isn't nearly as beneficial as being able to transmit money --  If it does grow exponentially the laws of supply and demand make it fairly clear where the price will go.

Yah,  I really don't see it that way..   I think 90 percent of the arguments against bitcoin presume that it is going to be used for everything everywhere every-time..   If that where the case that would be a bad idea..
The simple question is this .. Would you rather stuff a bunch of Federal Reserve notes in your mattress or stuff a bunch of bitcoin wallets?  What's likely to hold value in the long term?  As a store of value - I suspect that Bitcoin is going to be a better long term investment simply because it cannot be printed on a whim..    (Assuming of course that it sticks and becomes well enough adopted to establish it's tenure as a currency.)

You cannot "Stop mining bitcoins".   The exact same amount will be produced no matter how many miners there are.  That is the way the protocol is designed.   If there are less miners the difficulty drops.  If there are more, the difficulty increases, but either way, we should average 25 new BTC every 10 minutes.  
The price is the price, if it is going down it is because the market says it should be down.  There is nothing wrong with that aside from the fact that many of us bought too high..  That is our problem, not Bitcoin's.

I would say that it is a Bubble.   Not a ponzi.   A ponzi takes one investors money uses it to give a profit to the prior.   Bitcoin does none of that.  
If your definition of "sharing charactaristics of pyramid" is need for increased demand to sustain an increased price, than nearly every commodity meets that definition.

No significant reason to believe it would..  Decreasing the difficulty means that Block rewards would be issued more often, and thus there would be more bitcoin on the market.

The only reason there was plummet to be had is because the coinbase exchange rumors fueled a climb.

I don't know that Coinbase's exchange really changes things massively in the short term.  Prior to the exchange opening you could still buy coin via coinbase.

So while it is good news, it really isn't anything earth shattering or game changing..

His name was Cummerbund. The real Roberts has been retired 15 years and living like a king in Patagonia.'"

I would suggest that Bitcoin hasn't found it's sweet spot yet...  It is fun that there are companies that take it but that isn't where it is going to hit it's stride..
What is really powerful is that it allows machines and software to pay their own bills ---  So somebody can write a program, deploy it and forget it -- and the program will pay it's own hosting -- collect it's own revenue etc..  That is going to take a few years to take hold..   It allows for new levels of trust within computer networks -- I know you are not a spammer because you gave me .0005 cents and that would drive you broke if you where a DDOS attack..  Lots of possibilities open with  machine to machine payments.    
it is also going to be really good for pay per-view, and things like newpaper sales --  In the old day I could drop 50 cents in a newpaper machine and get a newspaper -- There is no way to do that on the internet until now..  
Bitcoin enables a ton of new technologies - and that is what will drive it's price --  I don't think it will displace regular money anytime soon..  But it will be the money of the internet...

If Bitcoin is digital gold,  one ought to ask themselves, would I leave my gold with these guys in promise of x% return?  Rarely do I see such offers, for good reason -- Because Gold doesn't generate interest.  Neither ought bitcoin -- interest is a central bank invention.

I have thought as you do..   I bought my 200 bucks worth..  
With that being said..  If bitcoin does go to lets say 30,000 dollars -- I suspect 30,000 dollars won't we worth what 30,000 dollars is worth now..  It will have gotten to 30k mostly based on deflation of USD, not growth of BTC.
I think that people have vastly underestimated the velocity of Bitcoin..  When everyone is hoarding it is scarce and difficult to come by and the price has to go up due to supply and demand.  
Once it transitions from the "digital gold" model to the "copper penny" model -- scarcity doesn't work like we expected.  Microsoft, Dell, Dish, Expedia, Overstock and many more are constantly churning BTC for USD..  as a result there is quite frequently Bitcoin for sale at market-- and that entire book needs to be consumed before the price will rise..  
The faster adoption happens, the bigger this "for sale at market" book gets..  The supply side gets bigger the more adoption takes place.    Bitcoin will eventually establish a "copper penny" model price, and scarcity will still effect this model -- But from a different baseline than we have now. 
So I still think it is worth having a toe in the water,  I doubt it will be "retire with dignity for 200 dollars" kind of returns.  It will be "that was a darn good investment" returns, but more of the nature that you could find in stocks and bonds if you where darn good or darn lucky.

In the US there are Circle and Coinbase that will deposit and withdraw money from your bank account when you buy and sell Bitcoin.  If your other country has a simular service, or if Coinbase or Circle work there, or if you can find an exchange the deposits into that countries banks, then yes, you can do what you are talking about..  Otherwise you would have to find a buyer and do your own deposit.. 
The point I was trying to make is that Bitcoin is separate from USD..  You cannot transfer USD from one place to another with Bitcoin -- You can trade your USD for Bitcoin, then sell your bitcoin for USD..  Bitcoin only exists and will always only exist within the Bitcoin network in the cloud -- So you don't really move it from here to there..  It is always in the cloud and exchange the control of it in the cloud for other currencies.

Most Ponzi schemes say they have a "secret sauce"  Which makes them able to do things that nobody else has done before..
With Cryptocurrencies, that 'Secret Sauce" is always a bit more plausible, because we are in the process of inventing money that can do things that could never be done before..
But they are still Ponzi's -- Most all of them.  If you really have the secret sauce it is economically silly give away your massive profits to people who invest 20-100 dollars...  Occams razor says Ponzi on most all "Bitcoin investments"

Generally, I think cryptocurrency is a good thing to embed into the web, because it can make bandwidth transactions expensive to abuse.  For example, If I am amazon.com and you are my customer I am happy to reimburse you for your bandwidth.  If you are a DDOS attack I can choose not to, and you will quickly run out of resources..  
It is important to build anonymity into that process though..  One ought not waive their privacy rights entirely to use the net.

The reason the price was high is because nobody was selling..
Then came along Overstock, Dell, Expedia, Dish, Microsoft..  All selling almost every day.   Plus your normal inflationary pressures of 25 BTC every two hours..  In order for Bitcoin to go up - all of the "Sell at market" orders must be consumed..  
In short - this is a new and dynamic market, and apply technical analysis from other securities probably doesn't work yet --  The game is still changing, and the nature of the asset hasn't really fully emerged and matured..

In the old days you had to send your money to some shady exchange in eastern Europe if you wanted to buy big amounts of Bitcoin.   
Sending it to a venture capital backed US based company is a lot easier to justify to your bosses when you are investing other people's money.   
The "Other people's money" is a huge market.   And once Bitcoin can be used as investment in a not so shady method there is a good chance a lot of money will flow in.

There is the potential of profit, if it is exponentially adopted like facebook or Twitter or the like and demand exceeds supply..  
But that is a big IF,  and that is not a "promise".  
I think people by and large underestimated the velocity of bitcoin.  So long as there is somebody like Dell or overstock or Microsoft that is willing to trade BTC for Fiat at market, the price will not rise.  The more Bitcoin is used, the less is needed to go around and fulfill everybody's transacting needs.  
But that error in judgement falls on the investors, not bitcoin.

Venture capital funded internet companies often build their market way before they figure out how to monetize the market..
Twitter was pretty huge before they had any idea how they where going to make money.   
The risk of a 0 confirmation transaction and double spending fraud is pretty small.   I believe they claim to have never had a problem with it..  
I suspect that their plan is to become the "go-to expert platform" and then have paid products and customizations --  If Bitcoin takes off, they have an opportunity to make a lot of money just because the nature of their business is going to make them big holders of bitcoin.    They probably sell large amount of bitcoin off market and for a premium --  In the shallow liquidity pool - you cannot buy a lot of bitcoin without driving your own price up..
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:02:25
Bitpay uses algorithms to calculate the chances that a double spend would be accepted, and after the likelihood is well below their risk tolerance, the approve the transaction..  Usually it takes a few seconds before enough of the bitcoin network is aware of the impending transaction that a double spend would most likely be rejected..  According to some sources, they have never had a successful double spend..    
Some more technical explanations can be found here:  
Remember even confirmations can be reversed..   It is all just a matter of probability, and the truth is that successful double spends are a lot easier in theory than in practice simply because the computer scientist asks "is it possible" not "what are the likelyhood of the logistics of such a thing being pulled off"

Bitcoin really doesn't exist in any particular country -- So "transferring" is kinda an odd word for it..  You can buy bitcoin here, and sell it there no problem, assuming there is an exchange or a buyer over there.
It is slowly going up in value, but if you hold it for a month or two it could be worth 10 dollars, and it could be worth thousands --  I wouldn't recommend putting more money into bitcoin than you care to lose, but I would recommend investing in as much as you don't mind losing.. ( The upside is much bigger than the downside, but the downside is still darn near 100%)

I don't think there is anyway to know.  
My gut tells me that the more commerce picks up, the lower the price will go..   Vendors or their bitcoin processors always need to sell at market ASAP to avoid volatility risk, and as long as there are Bitcoin for sale at market, the price will not rise..  
Eventually as demand rises, prices will go up..  Not too sure about "to the moon" though,  we have already been there -- It was fun for some, but not for others.

Bitcoin isn't terribly good for brick and mortar stores in my opinion.  
The incumbent solutions work just fine there, take less time and less to go wrong..    The 10 minute confirmation issue is a makes for a hard sell -- even if it isn't as big of an issue as people make it out to be..
Bitcoin needs to find its niche, and compete in that niche...  Streaming pay per view for example --  or micropayments on paid content --  In the old days you could drop 2 quarters in a box and get a newspaper... There is nothing like that for the internet version of a newspaper -- But Bitcoin could be...  
Everyone wants bitcoin to be what they want it to be - but it will be good for what it is good for and not so good at what it is not so good for.

Maybe.    If you where paid your salary in bitcoin today would you leave it there?   I certainly wouldn't..  It might be worth 1000 today and 750 tommorow..  A sizeable portion of the population is living paycheck to paycheck - so this really isn't tollerable.  
Unless you are unbanked, or work overseas, or deeply in the bitcoin culture, I don't see a lot of folks getting paid in BTC anytime soon.   
As someone who works on payroll software I can tell you there really is little incentive..  
Money works pretty darn good for most people.   Bitcoin is better at some things.   As such, I suspect Money will retain most of it's marketshare for a very long time..  
Bitcoin doesn't need a huge marketshare to be a pretty big deal though..

This is one of the most important frontiers for Bitcoin..
If I am going to buy a Dell, I am going to give them my name, my address, and all kinds of other information anyway..  Bitcoin doesn't have a ton of advantages over Visa in those cases for the consumer..  
But If I want to read a newspaper, I used to drop 75 cents in a slot..  If I want to watch a local H.S. football game, I pay 3-5 dollars..  Bitcoin is perfect for those kind of transactions.  The consumer benefits because they don't have to fill out a big long order form,  and the vendor wins because the fees from visa take up a massive chunk of the revenue on small purchases.  
Media vendor adoption is going to be the sweet spot where it is a win-win for both the vendor and the consumer..

Yes, eventually it will not be changed as readily back and forth to fiat, but I think that most of the current pricing models expected the velocity to be the same as they have been - but with Dell, expedia, overstock etc.  The prices have generally dropped not risen, simply because there is always plenty of bitcoin for sale at market prices.   As it becomes more used, that trend is going to continue..

The basic Cryptography behind bitcoin is insanely well tested, and if it is cracked wide open so are all of the other https website technologies..
Bitcoin is the only horse you can bet on right now -- It's mining network makes it really hard for competitors to just jump right in and steal market share.  If they run on the same technology as bitcoin there is so much discarded mining hardware available it would be very easy to attack a competing blockchain.  If they use a different kind of blockchain - then they are re-inventing a wheel that doesn't need re-invented..  It is much easier to build on top of bitcoin than to build beside it.
I suspect that Ripple will be a competing technology--  It is more aimed at the established banking system  --  It performs some functions that Bitcoin really doesn't at the core level.  So it will be a simular technology with a different market niche.
But I strongly suspect bitcoin is here to stay.  Simply because it works, and it is easier to use the already built system than to invent a new one for sport.

Putting the 1MB in was an quick hack.  It was a mistake, but he was not a moron. 
 The idea the fees could fix real technological constraints is just supply and demand.

We can run fees to the moon, but it still won't increase the capacity of the network.   Just make it too expensive to be useful for anyone...
The "market" arguement isn't valid.  Markets work because high fees incentivize increased capacity to meet demand.  Bitcoin cannot increase capacity, because it won't increase capacity.    
Name one other mainstream internet technology that isn't capable of sending 2 MB every 10 minutes...     
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:39:11
Fees are pointless in the market as they have no ability to incentivize increased capacity.  
.17 cents is a lot to pay for me to demonstrate Bitcoin to a friend.   In order to make that fee seem even slightly reasonable, I have to give them 10 dollars or so.  
I don't know of any other internet technology that isn't able to send 2 MB every 10 minutes.  It is artificial scarcity.   
In the long term artificial scarcity will fail in the marketplace against any emerging technology that is focused on solving the problem of transferring value from one party to another.  
The only reason people haven't fled yet is because they are vested in Bitcoin.  Newcomers will go with the thing that works best.
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:27:07

But if bitcoin is fragile enough that propagandists can cripple it,  and drive up the cost of using the network for everybody, it's broken and needs fixed.

@_date: 2016-06-15 23:02:19
Satoshi envisioned a fee market to address the case of real scarcity, not fake scarcity.  
Miners that where getting paid well via fees could afford to buy more bandwidth etc.  
But the current bandwidth cap prevents that.   (Satoshi clearly said 1MB was a temporary hack)  No matter how well the miners get paid in fees, they will only be able to carry 1MB worth of transactions.

Bitcoin has no rules aside from the software the the nodes choose to run.   There is no rule against forking bitcoin.   
If you don't like XT, don't run it.  Seems like a lot of whining to me. Bitcoin works the way it works.  If people don't like it, they ought not run it then there is nothing to worry about.  If they don't like the way bitcoin can be forked, then the need to write something proprietary that cannot.   
Developers are not slaves.  They can leave and start new projects when they choose.  Users can follow them or not.  But the process works.    
You only need 51%percent for a fork.  75% makes it so that the fork is nearly certain to make the other blockchain fork useless.  That is just plain old math.  The fact that the threshold was set high  means that it intends to move Bitcoin forward, not to split it or destroy it.  It isn't hostile -- It is progressive..  May be a better way of moving forward -- but anyone can write that fork as well..

This is like the queen dissolving parliament and allowing a new election.  
Bitcoin has been running under the government (Software) of Bitcoin-core.  Bitcoin core works fine for now, but it will not be able to scale..   The debate over how to adapt Bitcoin core has stalemated, so two of the developers left and attempted to form a new government.  
In the end the voters will decide..  If the miners adopt XT, then XT will be the new set of rules that bitcoin runs under.  If not, it will continue to run under bitcoin core..  
People saying it is an alt-coin are inaccurate..  It is a new proposed set of rules for bitcoin.  If it is adopted, those who choose to stay with Bitcoin core will create an altcoin when they refuse to approve a block that is larger than 1 mb..  If it is not adopted by over 75% then nothing changes at all, as BitcoinXT follows the same rules as Bitcoin core until that threshold is reached..

The problem on July 4th as I understand it was that Miners where not checking blocks, and where trusting whatever the network sent down.  
It was their malfunction. It was their loss of coinbase rewards.  Hopefully they learned their lesson.   
You didn't answer my core question though -- how can anyone even pretend like bitcoin core's fork will be sustainable at the same difficulty with &lt;15% of the mining power?  (Probably less than 5 as they have 2 weeks notice)   
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:36:37
Pro - it will allow bitcoin to do more than 7 transactions per second - which is badly needed if it is ever going to be a mainstream payment method.
Con - it will make miners less competitive who have slow internet connections.  The bulk of the miners are in China where the energy is subsidized and cheap - but they have slow internet.  
Other con - it will make the blockchain bigger - and will make it more expensive to run a node.  
All in all, if bitcoin is going to grow, it will be at a cost, and that cost will have to be a burden to one group or another.  But the alternative is stopping growth, which isn't going to fly -- People didn't invest millions so we could have what we have now -- They invested their VC because they forsaw the growth.  
@_date: 2015-08-17 21:41:17
An oversimplification would say Basically sidechain transactions would wind up being similar to what you see with transactions between one coinbase user and another..  (Won't show on the blockchain at all)  Just rather than being a ledger in the Coinbase office computers, it would be anther cryptocurrency blockchain that would hold the balances.. 
All in all, transactions take up space.  Moving them to a sidechain just offloads the problem onto another blockchain which is still going to need space.  All the downsides to largeness will apply there too..
If the community solution to needing to scale is "don't scale"  Then Bitcoin will not come to it's full fruition..  I suspect either XT will win, or Core will compromise and put in a scaling solution of their own.  It will sort itself out.  
 
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:23:43
If 25% or more think it is a bad idea, it won't happen.   No harm, No foul.  
If it forks, everyone will know it is going to fork (At least two weeks notice)  
Accidental forks are not managed at all. The forth of July fork was a totally different issue than an XT fork will be.  Although the miners that don't follow consensus do so at their own peril.   This won't be an accident -- Everyone will know it is going to happen.  
You have nothing to worry about unless there is 75%  consensus behind XT.   
How do you think the bitcoin core will mine blocks with only 5-10 percent of the hashpower and the same difficulty?  The fork won't go far because it can't.  
@_date: 2015-08-17 21:18:49
I think bigger is the eventual answer..   The question is how fast and by what means it should be implemented.. 
Sidechains are basically alt-coins that are pegged to bitcoin..   So  we can freeze bitcoins on the bitcoin blockchain as collateral for coins on another blockchain that behaves differently than bitcoin's blockchain..   (Faster confirmations or cheaper micropayments for example)  Sets of transactions that happen on these alt-sidechains could then be settled on the bitcoin blockchain in summary transactions.  
The allegation is that many of the opponents to big blocks have vested interest in some of these hack-around solutions and thus have incentive to stonewall a mainstream bitcoin fix.   
Dunno.   It is what it is.  It will sort itself out.  At least it is interesting.  ;-)
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:18:36
Kinda a nuanced difference. I said "If it is ever going to be a mainstream payment method"  Some folks think bitcoin should be the payment process others argue it should only be the settlement engine.  And something else ought to power the payments. 
It will be an inadequate payment processor with the current block size.  
Perhaps I oversimplified, but the OP wanted it simplified.

USD are debt based money.  The Fed writes a bad check and money is made out of thin air..  
Bitcoin is more like gold.   You don't earn interest on gold.  If you put gold in a box, there will not be 2% more in a year.   
If you put USD in a fractional reserve bank they loan 90 percent of it out to people who put that money in the bank where 90 percent is loaned out again, and 90 percent is loaned out again etc.   
Anything you do in bitcoin that pays interest will be ponzi in nature.  You can do BTCjam type stuff -- but it is always going to be risky because there isn't a central bank handing you profit all of the time.

If XT succeeds, it will take over the Bitcoin Blockchain.  
Bitcoin core's blocks will likely die outright.   Confirmation times will be extraordinarily long, and the rewards will only be spendable on the bitcoin-core fork.  With two weeks advance notice, only idiot miners would stick with the losing blockchain.  
If XT fails ever get to the 75% block threashold, no fork will happen.

Look for DKIM=pass  in the source headers of your email.
If that is there - that means that the message was signed by the private key of the sending domain.  If it was altered in transit by a third party without this private key, you would not have a DKIM = pass.   
It is theoretically possible that somebody on the same domain spoofed the email.   Although less likely.

As with all security, it is a matter of how paranoid you care to be..  
I did mention the risk you mention.  
Most folks don't have PGP keys at this point so they would have to set it up. If you are trading PGP with a stranger, you don't know if it is the stranger you want or the stranger in the middle.     
It really depends on how much you care.   If you are selling a 10,000 dollar item a higher degree of paranoia is warranted, but if you are selling a 15 dollar t-shirt or going through a massive rigamarole over something that is not worth an attacker's time is silly.  Checking the DKIM takes a few seconds and limits the number of possible attackers to a pretty small number, with little to gain.   It is probably adequate for most moderate transactions.

Not under anything near normal conditions.  You cannot roll back the Bitcoin ledger.   There are some rather rare occasions where it will roll back on it's own due to technical issues or random coincidences --  but in most cases all of the same transactions are know about by the network and are included in both forks of the blockchain.  
So, in practicality, No, but theoretically yes.  If the fork happened at the exact right time and you double spent you might get very lucky -- But unless you are habitually attempting double spends your chances are pretty near nil.

Most attacks have a gravity risk like that -- It is a huge investment just to get a return, if you are getting a return investing more to compete against yourself is foolish.  Destroying the value of the product you are mining is also foolish.  
Really it is only feasible if it where to be a large government intent on destroying bitcoin,  It would be a pretty massive undertaking even for them..    But even if they where successful, with some coding, the system  could swap to trusting the minority fork.

Some questions to ask:
Who is running it?  Do they have real names with real resumes that are traceable to real people that existed on the internet before this company appeared?
What country is it incorporated in?  Is the domain name registered to a real company with a real address? or is it a "secreted"  addressed registered anonymously?  
Bitcoin mining is designed to be a market-optimized Break even proposition.   You will not get rich by splitting a fixed sized pie into smaller and smaller pieces.  More miners create the same amount of bitcoin as less miners do, so that is exactly what happens with mining.  
Why would a company go after investors 99 bucks at a time?  If they really have a profitable product, wouldn't it be easier to find one or two big investors?   There is a ton of administration paying 1000 people 30 cents per day..  
Nearly always these things are scams.   Bitcoin is your investment.   You wouldn't send your gold in to be invested in some company that is going to return you more gold on your gold...  Bitcoin shouldn't be any different.

Most alternative currencies have been shut down because there are a lot of regulations that may or may not apply, and even though making a currency is very easy, making a currency without needing to spend millions of dollars on lawyers is quite hard.  
There have been many electronic currencies since the 80's but all of them have failed for reasons related to regulation, litigation or arrests..  
Decentralization allowed the technology to flow around this barrier --  Because there is no central authority, there is nobody to sue. Nobody to arrest, nobody to regulate in a manner that can kill the currency.   They still made arrests and litigation and regulation, but Bitcoin continues to churn out block every 10 minutes no matter what any government can do..
 Also centralized ledgers can be corrupted by the manangement that operates it.   (Should we trust Mark Karpeles and Mt Gox for example)   That was a private centralized ledger.
You can create a centralized ledger.  No problem there.  But if you want to do anything public and financial with it, you can expect some big legal bills.   Bitcoin's ledger works fine- and there is little downside to using it.  No reason to reinvent the wheel to make a more dangerous one.

Proof of existence on the blockchain removes government from the equation for the most part.  If the government gets overthrown the new government decides to convieniently "Lose" some records, truth will still be provable as to who owned what.  
There is nothing that can be done about people with guns that ignore the truth.  But the truth is still the truth, and now that truth is recorded in the blockchain, not in some possibly corrupt office that can "lose" records and forge new ones at will for personal gain.
That is a big deal.   It doesn't solve all of the problems, but it does make it a lot easier to have an incorruptible record going forward.

I am not sure that that definition is quite accurate.   The biggest value that Bitcoin will bring is an impartial incorruptible notary.  Money and currency is one app, but it also will cover all other assets and documentable events.  
The idea for example that we can indisputably (from here forward)  know who owned what land in Honduras, for example without relying on the word of government officials who may come or go -- and may be good guys or bad guys.  Is a pretty big thing that we have never had before.

There are two versions of the word "fork" in the current controversy.  
Software can fork.   You can take Bitcoin Core for example and press the Fork button on Github, and add your own stuff to it, and run a forked version.  That is what happened here..   Gavin and Mike took the Bitcoin-core code, made a few changes and published it as Bitcoin XT.   
You also can have a Blockchain "hard fork"  This happens when the rules by which the blockchain is being built diverge, and some clients accept blocks that others would reject.  This can happen by accident or intentionally.    
If Bitcoin XT succeeds in getting 75% of the miners it will give 2 weeks notice that it will begin generating blocks bigger than 1 mb.   When that happens any miners still running bitcoin-core (assuming it hasn't been patched)  will reject them, and the blockchain will fork -- 75 % + of the hashpower on the new blocks..  
The old blockchain fork will die quickly as it has way less hashpower than it needs for the difficulty.  Confirmation times will be insanely long, and Block rewards will only be spendable on the weak blockchain.  In short, sticking with the old dead chain is a waste of time and money for miners..  The stragglers will be forced to switch to a XT compatible set of software if they want to continue mining profitably.  
If XT fails to get 75% of the hashpower, it will keep on working compatible to Core, and no blockchain fork will happen.  
Many folks are mixing the two "forks"  and using the confusion to amplify doubt and confusion..

That may be a bit of an exaggeration, It was fairly clear that decentralization was a goal...  Bitcoin was intended to be "Without trusted third party"  If you have a bitcoin organization that drives how it works and steers it in various directions due to political forces you have a entity that becomes the trusted third party, even if they are using a peer to peer network to do it..  
The last words of the whitepaper lay out how upgrades work: "Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."  Changes where meant to be hard and to require consensus.  Bitcoin works.   Consensus takes time.  It will come where it needs to come.

It is expensive to re-invent the wheel.   I think for public transactions, Bitcoin has the first adopter advantage, and it will be insanely expensive to displace..  
Crytpo-anarchists would prefer something more anonymous.  
Banks and accounting systems can build their own blockchains by using chains of hashes between blocks of transactions to make the contents and sequence of transactions untamperable.  There are some advantages to this, but there was bigger advantages to posting these into a publicly accepted blockchain -- as it proves that you didn't generate an entire blockchain based on the reality you want to portray.  By posting to the bitcoin blockchain they can prove that they haven't tampered with their own blockchains as the bitcoin blockchain is decentralized.

I expect a slow steady growth, not a massive explosion.  
The reason is that people who have money already have incumbent means of spending it, and Bitcoin by and large does not blow the pants off of Credit or debit cards for example -- They are easy to use and rather low knowlege systems..
The growth is going to come from machine to machine transactions..  That takes time to develop.  Machines have no fear of learning curves etc -- They will be programmed to use Bitcoin because it is fast, simple reliable, and requires little maintainence.

Ripple is a protocol for electronically trading IOU's of one nature for IOU's of another nature.   It is pretty darn cool.
It is not loved by Bitcoin folks because bitcoin is about eliminating the middlemen, and Ripple empowers the middlemen..   (the IOU's are in the possession of trusted third parties).   Many people think that the XRP currency is too concentrated in the hands of Ripple labs, and they believe that Ripple labs is a running a centralized network.
I think that the ripple protocol is decentralized -- Anyone can download and run a node -- The problem is that there is no financial incentive to do so..  
All in all, Ripple is worth checking out, and it is worth using for what it is good at..  I can send USD to my friend, and he can recieve Japanese Yen, for example --  
Ripple could be a good gateway technology for bitcoin  (It automatically creates Bid ask markets for assets of any flavor)  
I don't see it as a competitor for bitcoin -- Just a simular techology that is a little to cozy with the banks to be compatable for the cryto-anarchists and the hard core libertarian bitcoin talking points.

Bitcoin isn't really opressible..  You can prevent fiat from being converted into Bitcoin or vice versa, but Bitcoin is speech, and it is censorproof unless you unplug a country from the internet altogether.  
Countries  ban things all of the time,  Drugs, alcohol etc.   Usually it doesn't hurt business much - just pushes it underground.   You really cannot get caught with bitcoin, as it only exists virtually..  this makes it much harder to police.  
All in all, countries that ban it will do so at their own peril, as the countries that do not will be able to use new and powerful technologies, and those that ban them will be left in the dark ages.

Many of your ideas about where bitcoin ought to go are yours, and not bitcoin's.  Bitcoin doesn't care where it goes, who uses it and for what.   So when you say "hampered"  I think that is a bit of an exageration.  
Was it really intended for 7B+ people to use?  I don't think so.   Was it ever intended that "governments would adopt bitcoin as an official currency?"  I don't think so.

I am fairly convinced that Bitcoin is going to be an "underlying" technology more than a surface level technology.  
It allows value to be transferred from machine to machine, via software, simply, cheaply and efficiently.  
Sure, anyone can use it -- but it is much easier to have software do it -- And in most cases our incumbent payment methods are adequate enough that they are going to be difficult to displace.  
So in short - Bitcoin's growth is going to come from integration with new technologies -- and the decentralized consensus possible with the blockchain is the main draw to integrate with.

Living in Washington and observing, I suspect most of them piggyback off of an existing or newly created business for tax evasion reasons.   Thus the expenses get funneled to the coffee shop or bar in the front, and the MJ operation, has very little expenses.  
Unlike most businesses, business expenses are not deductible if you are selling drugs, of which marijauna is hard coded into the statutes - so until the federal congress changes the laws, people are going to have to do monkey business and laundering if they want to stay in business.. 
Most of the 'front' operations ought not have as much trouble getting banking, or bitpay/coinbase accounts.  I notice that the 3.50 per withdrawl ATM in the lobby seems to be the method of choice, however..  
It is always fun to try to explain Bitcoin to a stoner..  You all should give it a try sometime.  Until somebody finds a magic way to overcome that obstacle, adoption in this field is going to be slow.  The shop owners might be game, but who is going to train the customer base?

I wouldn't count on bitcoin skyrocketing anytime soon.   
I think it is in the process of transitioning from being digital gold to digital copper--  (It is meant to be spent - like pennies..)  Once it is being spent all of the time instead of hoarded - there will always be a fairly good sized "for sale at market" block of coin being offered, and the price cannot rise until this is consumed.  
In short, bitcoin that is being spent can be spent again and again and again really fast -- so supply will remain failrly good..  
So a new normal will emerge,  then the price will raise from that -- 
I still think it will raise, and raise substantially because there are a lot of markets out there that if Bitcoin claimed 3-5% of them it would double the market cap..  
But when that raise comes and from what baseline it begins is a bit of a mystery.

Does it matter?  There isn't anything anyone can do about it.   You can pass laws preventing law abiding people from using bitcoin, but the terrorists and outlaws don't care about laws..
Every technology is used for both good and evil.  Nobody has figured out how to uninvent stuff yet.

Rushwallet.com.   Have them wiggle their mouse.   Have them Paste the public key into an IM window, send them a quarter or two.  
Fast and easy.  The faster you send the money, the more impressed they are.

The odds of finding one are so slim compared to the amount of power you would spend searching that you would lose money..  
There are some easy pickin' brain wallets out there though.

Wallet addresses are just insanely large made up numbers..  It is best practice to only use them once..  I would find yourself another wallet software, and transfer your coin ASAP.  They do look highly suspect -- Hopefully you get your money out.

Banks get robbed a lot more than average Joes do too..
That is where all the money is.   
In Bitcoin's case however, usually the bank robberies are inside jobs.

The upside on Bitcoin is pretty huge..  
The downside is always zero.
You can make money on other Crypto's.   Ripple for example went up 5 fold a few months ago..
In the end, the most likely winner will be bitcoin -- and if that happens, you will see exponential growth in price, and the altcoin's will likely be left far in the dust..   
So if your money is in altcoins and the exponential rise starts, you stand to lose a ton of potential profit.
But everything is a gamble..  Nobody knows what will happen.  Anybody who does is selling you something. (usually so they can dump it)

Why the hell would you create a blockchain if you where a centralized system like the FED?  It's like using a rube golberg machine..   Yes you could, but why?  There is no need for decentralized consensus if there is a central authority.
If you want to run an electronic currency you just build it in a centralized fashion, and the blockchain is unnessesary.  
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:55:39
Yes.  Fiat isn't as easy to steal electronically, but it is still pretty easy to take by an insider.   Most of these "hacks" are inside jobs.
  If the exchange is insolvent they are insolvent and it doesn't matter which bucket leaked -- They still don't have enough money to pay their debts, and it probably doesn't matter which bucket your money was in, because that isn't how accounting works.   Your money isn't held in a special bucket that either gets stolen or not -- Your "money" is just an entry on the spreadsheet that has to balance to the asset side of the ledger along with everyone else's..  If the asset side is short, the account holders are all at risk.

Unless you where in it for a get rich quick scheme,  I don't think bitcoin is hurting too much.   
I think I am going to write some Internet of Things software that will allow my appliances negotiate and buy services from one another.

No.   It will still take a decade or more for various inventions to come along that use bitcoin.  Machine to machine transactions and so forth will take some time to develop. 
Bitcoin has already been maked, and it is looking doubtful that it will break..   
People keep looking for Bitcoin to meet their expectations, but it's math..    It does what it does and it doesn't care what anyone thinks..

There is a large contingent who think that Bitcoin is too traceable.   It is good to mark real world examples for them to chase..

Do you have documentation of another process being used?
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:15:41
I see altcoins more like junk bonds than pennies..  My point is that pennies get spent..   I think if Bitcoin comes to it's full fruition it will also be spent..  Gold is cool and all, but people don't use it much for transactions..  
I do think people underestimate the velocity of the Bitcoin currency once it is being used..  It may be used over and over and over again, very quickly --  And as such the price will not rise as quickly as it might if people just hoarded..  
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:20:04
He would say such, being a centralized third party that is a gateway to Bitcoin.   Ripple has the potential to be a decentralized gateway to Bitcoin and any other asset..  There is value in that.
Crytpocurrency has room for more than one function/solution.

I don't trust any cloud mining platforms.  
The whole concept makes little sense.  If the miners where profitable why lease them out?  
I suspect most of them are fronts for ponzi's.   Time will show that if it hasn't already.

If you put in a buy order for one bitcoin at 1000 I bet it would fill the very instant you placed it.  
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:21:25
It really depends.   
We use pennies a lot more that we use gold.  
If you want it to be digital gold, you may not get what you want.  But that isn't Bitcoin's fault..   It may be better suited to being digital dimes.  
I think that the price goes down because it is being used.  It is hard for bitcoin to go up when Microsoft, Dell, Expedia, Dish, Overstock etc have a decent number of Bitcoins on the market every day.  All of those "Sell at market" orders must be filled before the price rises.  The faster it is adopted the bigger this issue becomes.
Eventually it will find its real price point as a currency, and the price will go up from there with exponential adoption.   But 1200 was a bubble, and it may or may not get back up there.. 
Anyway Bitcoin is still finding itself.   Many people have ideas about what it should be -- But until it is actually used for what it is going to be used for, it is all speculation.

It is fairly doubtful that he will move them anytime soon.  Any movement would undermine the price quite significantly, and lend some credibility to the naysayers.
Once Bitcoin is publicly adopted and well used, it wouldn't surprise me if he moved a bit.

Usually it is easy to see the assets of a Bitcoin exchange -- They can post those to the blockchain, and provide a digital signature proving that the wallets the funds are in are under their control.   Fiat balances can be verified through traditional means.  
The hard part is the liabilities.   The Exchange could give a list of customer balances, omitting some, and then they would look solvent --  The Merkle tree is a method of showing what balances where included in the statement of liabilities, but in such way that they don't have to disclose every users balance to every other user.  Users can check their account against the merkle tree and affirm that it was included as a liability.  
None of this methodology provides rock solid proof of anything.  The exchange could have liabilities other that customer balances that could make them insolvent--  They also could control assets that are not attached to the exchange business-- over-inflating the assets.. 
But the typical process for a bitcoin proof of solvency has been that --  Sign a message from a wallet or wallets containing your assets -- and provide a merkel tree that customer can verify to demonstrate liabilities.  If all checks out -- It makes it a lot more doubtful that you are running any fractional reserve..

Well the block rewards don't go away for 140 years or something.   
The general idea is that the fees will provide enough incentive once the volume is full bore.  Time will tell.  But most of us will be dead by then, and most likely something better will have come along by then..

Yes,  Consider it a lesson..  Chances are slim..  
Selling Bitcoin really is like selling cash --  You want something tangible in your hands before handing it over to an untrusted party..  
Coinbase and Circle are probably worthy of your trust  -- If they rip you off, their business model is compromised.

It is handy to have a mobile wallet to settle office debts with your bitcoin friendly co-workers.  
It also would be fun to pay for your beers/coffee at bitcoin friendly shops, if such thing existed.  
I tend to prefer the kryptokit wallet for the everyday internet kind of transactions.
I prefer a paper wallet for any quantity I would not be willing to have lost/stolen..
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:55:34
Nobody knows.
Anyone who pretends to is selling you on a pump or a dump.
Let Bitcoin grow for a couple more years, and volatility will go down, and eventually supply and demand will yield a consistant and moderately predictable price.  Til then, buyers and sellers are like a lineman jumping in a kiddy pool..   You will always get a crazy big splash. Once the bitcoin liquidity pool is more like a lake their impact will be smaller

A lot less risk robbing an exchange...   
My point wasn't really comparing Bitcoin to USD banks -- More saying that Average Joe's are not going to be hacked with the same veracity that the exchanges are.  
I think the "Hackings" are usually embezzlement, or fractional reserve issues until proven otherwise.   The Blockchain ought to substantiate the story -- In the case of Mt. Gox, that hasn't been shown..
Still a young technology run by amatuers for the most part -- that is quickly changing though..

The "Send a Satoshi to the hash of a document" to prove proof of existence doesn't require anything in the OP_RETURN..  I believe Proof of existence is usually what people are talking about as the "notary" function.

Bitcoin is your investment.    
Trusting them to somebody else is a losing proposition.   
Just wait, and they will either pay off massively, or they will not.  Bitcoin is risky enough of an investment without doubling down into an investment on top of an investment.

You can google for proof of solvency and you will find several examples of processes quite similar to this being used in real world situations.

I would suspect 10 or so years down the road, it would cause a lot less disruption that it does right now, and protecting his identity will not be nearly as critical --  If you had a choice of being the world's first trillionaire or being an anonymous college professor someplace who takes a billions to the grave, I am not sure that many people would take the later option..

Conversation seems to follow point by point to me.   But whatever.  
Who cares?  It will happen or it won't.  I doubt it will happen anytime soon.   You don't think it will ever happen.  We can talk till we are blue in the face and it won't make a lick of difference.  
By and large this is why the internet is a massive waste of everybody's time.

Bitcoin mining was always intended to be a break even enterprise..  The market forces keep it from getting too big or too profitable..  The pie is only so big, and new miners just make thinner slices for everybody.  
Scams galore, but they where all based on the lie that it was going to be massively profitable..

You didn't ever think "Gee, I oughta lease this out to strangers" did you?  ;-)
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:28:00
Nope.  
Bitcoin doesn't need a huge portion of transactions to be successful.  There are certain niches where it makes sense -- Machine to machine payments / Tolls.   Pay per view media -  International remittances etc..
There are ton of other areas where our current systems are perfectly adequate albeit not perfect.   Bitcoin doesn't need to oust incumbents so much as create new markets to be successful.  Just a tiny portion of a lot of these markets is a massive amount of wealth.

The reward for making the blockchain work is Bitcoin.  If there where no bitcoin currency, there would be little incentive to mine, which is what makes the blockchain.   
You could do it (mine)  for sport --  but the fact that there is a reward is what makes enough people do it that it is nearly impossible to corrupt.  
The game theory falls apart pretty fast without the block rewards which become the bitcoin currency.  There are other game theories that could incentivize a different blockchain.  But the one we have is  going to be very hard to beat in the near future..
