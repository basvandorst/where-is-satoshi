OMG LET ME DUMP MY GARBAGE KRW FOR BTC PLZZZ!

bcash is like [Cartman burger]( :
roger ver takes normal bitcoin, farts out all kinds of FUD and jargon all over it, and suddenly it's his special project!

I can't speak for everyone in Korea (cause I don't even speak Korean lol), but as soon the exchanges start allowing fiat deposits again, I'm going to be buying up all the cheap BTC and LTC that I can.
Somehow, I doubt that I'm alone in this intention.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:49:39
I meant the post that said that they logged in and saw their balance restored immediately 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:57:19
Very misleading. When I logged in I saw a nice big goose egg where my balance was.  Instead, if I click on the tab that says ‘old balance’ I can see how much BTC I (might) get back some time after January 31st.

I'm sure there are lots of experts who'd be happy to craft you an intricate how-to guide, but my advice is just to lurk and see what the most common answers to the many newbie questions are.
I only bought my first coins back in May, and am only barely tech savvy, but this sub is full of great resources (despite not being renowned for its civility) and some helpful people. 
Where there's a will there's a way. Just be patient, read a lot, and look for consensus on advice.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:12:50
Cheers, was wondering the same thing. Dumping imminent.

I plopped a wad of cash down on my wife's desk to prove to her that all my talk about crypto was actually paying off. Feels good man. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:30:29
How fucking desperate is this?
That said, I upvoted the guy stamping dollars with BTC propaganda, but the battle against fiat is real; BCH has been a loser from the getgo

Because bitcoin is going to be worthy fiddy cent soon?
@_date: 2019-08-25 01:32:11
The exchange I'm currently using charges 0.002(!?) to withdraw, highway robbery yes, but it's still a tiny bit cheaper than localbitcoins, which would be my only other option.
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:48:45
I got a call from Bitmain’s telesales department regarding the S11, so they must be bringing them online in droves these days.
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:21:11
Yeah sorry, I phrased that badly.  The exchange I use charges 0.002BTC to withdraw, making it so that when you consider the spread on the price you pay on localbitcoins, it ends up being about the same price (buying market price + high withdrawal fee = localbitcoins spread price)
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:52:43
I hung up on them haha, but I just heard a Filipina reading a scripted message: blah blah blah something something Antminer S11
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:29:42
Yeah I saw a post on the BCH sub bragging about how the .com site was in the top 2000 American websites, whereas .org barely broke into the top 4000.
God knows why they support that scam site, but it’s important to promote .org as much as possible, and do as much as possible to expose Ver’s scams.

I’m going to Japan next month and I REALLY want to spend some BTC there. I almost bought my tickets through the airline “Peach” which does accept BTC, but their prices/safety record leave a lot to be desired.
Does Bic sell the Nintendo switch, and do they offer a discount for paying in BTC?  I realize I could just look that up, but I just stumbled across this post...
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:31:34
You obviously don’t read this sub, or you wouldn’t be trying to rationalise THE OBVIOUS ASTROTURFING AND VOTE MANIPULATION that’s been going on. It’s not just perception, it’s not coincidental, there has been a concerted FUD campaign to malign BTC and pump up BCH, and if you’re out here trying to make excuses for the army of bad faith actors, you’re either neck-deep in your own asshole, or you’re just another gaslighting sock puppet.
This sub has become nearly unreadable since the weekend’s fiasco, and I hate to be yet another angry voice, but I’m fucking pissed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:40:06
When BTC is up this sub is an absolute love fest...
And then when it’s down it turns into a shit-slinging hate orgy...
I think that’s what makes bitcoin so great; it’s human nature, raw emotion, expressed in a new technological format, with paradigm-shifting results!
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:08:14
I don't know if it was just here (Korea) but there was a huge spike yesterday where we almost hit 10M, and then immediately back down to 9100K, within half an hour or so, sometime after the BCH PnD.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:33:33
Makes you wonder about the enlightened families discussing bitcoin in 2009-10 and their sick lambos now...
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:08:09
Do they take Bitcoin? I mean I know they don't, but as it's been said elsewhere, this should be the first thing out of our mouths whenever we go shopping.
Congrats btw!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:20:47
Charlie spitting truth as usual; it really does seem to make sense 
@_date: 2018-03-11 09:51:33
Cheers, thanks to your post I’m going to give this a go.  The Korean government has effectively blocked the exchange of fiat for crypto here, since December, and I’m sitting on all my extra Won. Maybe someone on Bisq wants it?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:56:50
You know it. I posted about this and some dimwits tried to say that segwit has nothing to do with the fee decrease, but the numbers speak for themselves.
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:10:34
I got the same amount of BTG as I had BTC in my bitfinex account today. Sold it all for 0.022 I think... anyways, I didn't have much BTC there and now I have only a tiny fraction more. Yawn.
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:19:03
It's good for what it is, but you'll pay out the ass in fees, and yeah things like cashing in on shitcoin forks is easier with Electrum, which also lets you set your own fees.
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:04:23
Ok, thanks for the info. I do have an old android phone that I could try that with. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:09:29
Yeah that's what I thought, but like I said, electrum tells me that, at the absolute lowest fee setting, I'd be paying $20 in mining fees.  Maybe this is just an estimate and the actual fees would be lower, but it seemed way too high.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:53:39
Yeah I had heard about censoring before I joined this sub too, but the proof is in the pudding.  Any idiot (myself included) can tell, simply by the level of discourse, that this is the true home of Bitcoin on reddit.
That said, there are a lot of not so eloquent or well-informed people here, and I sometimes find myself wishing this sub were censored more!  Some people are pointing out the hatred and ignorance that are bred in the "other sub", and I think that a lot that stems from the fact that they allow so much FUD to be spread about who or whatever they perceive their enemies to be.
I think that this sub would do well to crack down on FUD-spreaders as much as possible because it preserves the superior character of  our sub.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:30:46
Haha, no, you were right that I’m a relative newbie. I had been super intimidated and baffled by the whole cryptosphere up until quite recently, and that from a purely epistemological standpoint, I sympathized with the other sub, based on the very limited amount of info that I had. Maybe I’m just a sucker who believes anyone who cries “free speech”.
That said, at the time I did get into bitcoin, about six months ago, it was pretty clear to me who had the best interests of the community and the technology at heart.
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:53:57
Hah, yeah I didn't even realize I could do that, thanks! Just sent with a fee of 0.5mBTC so we'll see if/when that confirms.
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:18:45
"The BCH is back"
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:49:25
Yeah I'm guessing it's because of limited supply and high demand, and with the small disparity between the won and dollar (1100 = 1)
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:07:59
Shame man, yet another hitBTC story. I made an account there to dump my bcash when it was the only exchange taking it, and I never had any issues so I traded some alts there from time to time.
I know it’s super sketchy now because there are a lot people complaining that they can’t withdraw, and I have been unable to withdraw the alts I have there now for weeks (though this is $150 worth) which pisses me off.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:38:19
I actively avoid the other sub, but come across some posts there when browsing from my work computer, and can't understand the logic of supporting the fork.
I struggle to understand things from a technical perspective, as probably most would admit to, but from a teleological point of view, what I see as the end goal of bitcoin, it seems so simple: a decentralised system of building and controlling wealth for individuals, as opposed to organised capital.
Invoking Satoshi as some kind of deus ex machina to support one's vision for the future of bitcoin is par for the course on both sides it seems, but how can the other side claim that BCC/big blocks supports Satoshi's vision? Are there well-respected bitcoin contributors that actually support the hard fork, or are they all just shills/entrenched interests trying to line their pockets?
Can anyone give an argument for BCC that doesn't involve an inscrutable technical argument?  Are there any disinterested parties (from a financial perspective) that advocate the technical advantages of the hard fork?  What are the the philosophical justifications for increasing the block size if it increases dependence on miners and reduces the number of nodes?
These questions have been bugging me, and I'm asking them mostly rhetorically, but if anyone has any thoughts on the subject I'd appreciate hearing a little about it.

Do you need a lightning wallet to take the tip?  I've seen that zap wallet for desktop is an option so maybe I'll just have to give it a try.  You're doing good work sir!
