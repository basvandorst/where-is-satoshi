They don't have to destroy it, they can make it illegal to transact in it, or to exchange it for legal currency.

Perfect sense - thanks for your reply.
FWIW, from my (limited) understanding, I agree that it's needed, but disagree that it will ultimately be successful beyond small niche markets or maybe nations with nonfunctioning economic systems, for the simple fact that if it ever got to the point of significantly impacting current currencies or major economic systems, there would be legislative action to prohibit its use.

What exactly would prevent it?  The fact that it's in digital form wouldn't - online poker is nothing but streams of bits on a network, numbers, and people exchanging values for on-screen messages - they banned that.  Certain types of pornography are nothing but streams of numbers, that's banned.  Terrorist communications are just streams of data, but can land someone in prison.  As for what is definable as money - try making some fake currency and see what happens.  And there is a long history of regulating exchanges and what may be exchanged on them.

People did just that with Dutch tulips, dotcom stocks, and condos in Las Vegas - what makes the btc fad any different?

Apparently you haven't read many statutes.  Go take a look at some:
That's it.  That's the "pseudo legal code" prohibiting counterfeiting, that's enough to put you behind bars for doing it.  What exactly is it that you think they need to do, besides saying it's prohibited?  
It may be technically infeasible to physically eradicate the data itself, but if it were illegal to possess or exchange it, good luck using it to build your neckbeard anarchist utopia.
As for gold, the state has very much "to say about it" and is far from "impotent" - they've outlawed it before, even in the US:

What is the incentive to hold bitcoin there?  (sincere question - I'm failing to see why anyone would do it, given the obvious risks)

It's inherent in a fractional-reserve system - the monetary base must continually increase.  Further, every country on Earth runs at a deficit, simultaneously - that requires the monetary base to continually expand, or some change in the system which allows debt to be divorced from the value of the money its denominated in (which may be what's happening in effect, with global ZIRP, and the extraordinary printing everywhere especially since 2008).
But the short answer is that it can't happen because there is too much money at stake in the current system to allow it to collapse.  If bitcoin ever became more than a novelty, they'd simply outlaw it.  They may not be able to kill bitcoin itself, but they can criminalize its use - if you don't believe that, try playing poker online.
