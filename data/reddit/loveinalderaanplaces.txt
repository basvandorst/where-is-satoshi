ITT: people dismissing Apple wholesale because people use their products as a status symbol.
Yeah, it's overpriced, but if people *want* to pay that much for a computer, let them.  I got a MBP as a gift and I find it highly enjoyable to use, but I also have a custom built a PC and use that for just about everything when I'm at home.  They cost about the same.  I'm not complaining.
Anyways... Apple can eat a dick for not even giving a straight answer as to why they ban Bitcoin-related apps and in-app purchases.  They could easily enact a policy stating you have to give them a cut of Bitcoin sales if you are to support it in your app (hell, the blockchain makes it possible to double-check they're getting their cut!) but apparently that's too much for their shiny unibody aluminum asses.
EDIT: I hate to cliche, but getting downvoted here is an exact representation of what is turning into.  Come on, you guys can do better than that.

Go on and bitcointalk and make a post showing it off?  That'll at least get you started.

That means OP is Elijah Wood.  Can I have his autograph?

Aren't you a friendly one?
I don't have any stake in dogecoin yet, and quite frankly, I was afraid I'd get barraged with "such crypto much secure" and the like (or simply get downvoted) if I actually asked on if it was a joke, because the way it advertises itself would make it seem so but I couldn't be sure.
Fuck off.  I only wanted opinions and insight.

No, no, no, they'll deliver.

The whole side-chain thing looks preeeeetty interesting to me.  Has tons of implications.

I live in South Carolina!  I go to school in Georgia but I'm a legal resident and citizen of SC so this is great news.

Oh *fuck yes.*  I collect NES games for fun and would be all the hell over this.

You already can (sort of): 
Bet BTC on a match you intend to play, play it, and win the pot.

Instead of jabbing at Theymos as much as possible, why not do the constructive thing and link to the forum threads where these IT professionals are discussing this matter?  If you really think Theymos can't find it and that it's that big of a problem, then help him out. 
Maybe you'll get 50 BTC.  Or not, given your principles.

I don't really care what drugs people do, but I'm not going to mourn the death of SR since as long as it dominates the market, it gives lawmakers a chance to point a finger at Bitcoin and claim it only fuels the "drug problem" and use that as leverage to outlaw cryptocurrency/digital currency/etc.
That said, I have no doubt that there will be another SR equivalent to crop up in the next few weeks, which means it's going to be a turbulent market for a while.

SCAD student here!  You can be sure I'll be bringing my roommates with me to your place, because I'd love to help a business out that accepts bitcoin.  We'll bring our bit-cards and smartphones :)

Thanks for the advice, Dr. McButtfuck.

A fair point, I'm mainly frustrated that I had to jump through so many ridiculous hurdles just to pay $14 online, and to no avail.  Also [it's been discussed]( on their forums for a while that GOG should accept bitcoin, so I know for certain it's something that there's interest in.
EDIT: Also this was a GIFT card.  Not just a regular check/credit card.
@_date: 2013-09-11 05:45:20
That I definitely agree with.  I'm interested to see what kind of discussion takes place behind these closed doors, or if it's even "discussion" so much as insider access to what's going on in the foundation at this point in time.

I'm not being critical of GOG, I'm being critical of the gift card policy--read the OP.  The Visa policy is that you can't send gift card money outside of the US because it might be fraudulent.  I can't pay for games on GOG because they're based outside of the US as a result of this.

Fair assessment, but do bear in mind that federal and other government regulators are a lot more apt to listen to a nonprofit lobbying organization than a bunch of tech-savvy Internet users.  There's a reason the foundation exists.

My roommate and I call them "microcoins" and mBTC "millicoins," but yours is probably better.
