It's more likely everyone is hoarding cash because they'd like to eat over the next few weeks.  Why would anyone trade cash for something they can't eat?

This is because debit cards suck. If you use a credit card there's no problem.  You might not get instant reversal, but it doesn't matter because you don't actually settle up until the end of the month.  Credit cards are much better than bitcoin for consumers because if you have a dispute with the merchant the credit card company can help you out by reversing the charge.  If Expedia said they wouldn't refund you because they didn't feel like it you'd pretty much have no recourse with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:11:35
There was a post on BCT where someone bought BTC on coinbase or something and sent it to this address, thinking it generated a new one when you opened the webpage.
@_date: 2014-06-07 21:40:20
So are you doing real time processing of the data?  Is your processing loop just real slow?  Can you run a profiler on it?

Since I'm the only one mining everyone else would update, otherwise they are on the wrong side of my hard fork.
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:20:45
It's really easy, here are a few steps to get you started.
1.  Open a bank account with a separate bank than your regular one.
2.  Open a coinbase account
3.  Buy bitcoin from coinbase
4.  Wait a few days for it to arrive
5.  Purchase another computer
6.  Install linux and an offline wallet on that computer.  Disable the computer's internet for the rest of its life.
7.  Print out your seed and put it in a safe place
8.  Transfer the watching only wallet counterpart to your regular computer
9.  Transfer your bitcoins that offline wallet
Now if you want to spend your bitcoins:
10.   Generate a transaction on your regular online computer
11.  Transfer that transaction to your offline computer using a flash drive
12.  Sign the transaction with your offline computer
13.  Transfer that signed transaction back to your online computer
14.  Broadcast it over the internet from your online computer.
@_date: 2014-10-21 03:50:47
Maybe you could create an unspendable transaction.  If they don't look too closely they won't notice.  You lose the BTC but they won't gain it.
@_date: 2014-05-10 04:14:08
No, definitely use another computer. You could also boot a Linux live CD or USB key on the infected computer, just remove it before you reboot.

Let's play bitcoin.  You give me your ball and I'll give you two balls next week.  Actually I'll just steal your ball.
@_date: 2014-11-23 17:01:47
You aren't able to charge back if you're screwed over by whoever you bought something from.  You're most likely not able to properly secure your bitcoins and are at risk of getting them stolen.

Based on  it looks like it's run under screen.
So open a terminal and type screen -r that should pop up the bfgminer screen with more information.  Then to exit type ctrl-a ctrl-d.

Can you buy an ADC with 16 channels instead of one?
@_date: 2014-06-09 14:40:37
Yeah you should be able to go much faster with that.  Have you tried just a simple script that just reads from one channel as fast as it can? It's possible that matlab is using some slow sample rate as the default.  Also make up a quick vi that just reads as fast as it can and compare.
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:05:50
When companies accept bitcoin people use the bitcoin they were hoarding to buy stuff from them.  Those companies sell that bitcoin for real money because they're a business and have to pay their bills.  So when more merchants accept bitcoin it leads to people indirectly selling BTC by buying goods.  When lots of people sell it drives the price down.
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:18:40
Look at the actual bfgminer screen (not the mine peon web front end) and it'll tell you what difficulty you're working at.

"our keys" = PF Chang's keys, because PF got hacked and the OP wondered what PF thought of bitcoin.

This is actually GOOD news for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-30 15:42:18
And how will they ever be savy enough to secure their bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:46:20
Just use the ATM when you get there.
@_date: 2014-10-19 19:17:34
Just print it out unencrypted.  You're going to forget your password in 10 years.
@_date: 2014-06-09 19:36:26
You should check that you actually know how to spend coins from a paper wallet first.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:06:16
You definitely need to be connected to a network to mine.
@_date: 2014-07-18 10:51:26

Definitely open an account at your local credit Union and use that for bitcoin only.  Then open another account at another credit Union and use that for everything else.

The block that they solved includes the instructions to send the coin reward to the mining pool that sent them the block.  If they change the instructions on where to send the reward it changes the block and thus the hash of the block won't be correct.

Just download it from the website and install it yourself.

Coinbase has been reported to be asking what people are using their money for.  Some don't like that.  Since coinbase has your info it's not anywhere close to anonymous.

Yep it's using stratum with diff of 240.  I don't know about this pool, but a lot of pools let you log in and change the difficulty through their interface.

Sure, but I thought the idea of margin is that you borrow more than you put in.  So if I deposit $1000 and borrow $3000 worth of BTC, if the price of BTC skyrockets can't I just say goodbye to the $1000 and hide behind my tor connection so you can't get the other $2000 from me?

If you're hoping CurrentC will just switch to using bitcoin you're dreaming.  They invented CurrentC to get around having to pay credit card fees.  They didn't do it so that the savings are passed on to you.  They did it so the savings are passed onto them.

It's not really a mathematical problem in the sense of "two trains are leaving in opposite directions...".  Computers guess a number and then compute a hash based on a described algorithm.  If that hash is below a certain number then they will submit a valid block.  The number you have to be below decreases as difficulty increases.
Hash computation:

Your description isn't accurate.  It looks like you think that there is some bitcoin server room somewhere that people need access to for some reason.  Bitcoin is just a currency where everyone keeps track of who spent what, so that there's no one person / bank / government who controls that.  Everyone knows how much everyone else has and has spent.
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:59:44

I have heard that they do provide the key when paid, but of course you have no guarantee.  If you don't have offline backups then you'll need to pay if the data is important to you.  What country are you in?  Fastest way to get bitcoins is probably on localbitcoins.  Remember to include a fee.  You can probably send it directly to the hacker's address from localbitcoins.  Use another computer to do this though, or your online wallet will also be compromised.

The key is that you can't predict what the hash of a number will be.  So if you hash X you'll get Y, but you cannot know what Y is before you do the hash algorithm.  The other key is that you can easily verify that Y is the hash of X, so someone can check your work.
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:37:57
Tor forces your traffic to go through an exit node.  It's not meant to secure your data, it just anonymizes the path the data takes.  There's no reason for you to hide your IP from the blockchain.info site, so there's no reason to use Tor.  Tails was a fine way to go, but you need a sufficiently strong password , two factor authentication, and if you use email backups they need to go to an email account that also uses a strong password and two factor authentication that you also only access through tails.
Really it's better if you use offline signing.

If they're using bitcoin I think the minimum transaction is 540 something satoshis, so you'd need off-chain to do 1 satoshi.  But I don't see how anyone can use "the" blockchain for stock trades because of the confirmation time and volume limitations.
