yeah there is really no way to short bitcoin besides selling your bitcoins and buying back in lower.

relative to bitcoin, yes and here is more relevant information:


pulled that from an article I found about Coinbase's inception [here!]( So assuming Coinbase got off the ground with 600k, I think this could be enough to start a new exchange.

or dead!

Yeah would be interesting if [this]( went through so we could see ebay offer both Paypal and Bitcoin payments and let them compete directly. It probably won't happen but it would be huge for Bitcoin if it did.

woah i was just digging up some info, didn't mean to offend you psynusoidal. I was curious as well
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:28:34
how do you short bitcoin?

why so hard on OP, he is only stating his opinion. I for one think that the panic sellers are dumb to not buy back in at this new price because for now it is starting to stabilize again. I'm not saying throw all your money but this is the time to take risks for potentially big returns. As time tickers away more and more wall street people and their clients will have learned what bitcoin is and add it to their risky portfolios which will drive the price up over the new year. I still predict a crash around christmas time but this could have been it (if not this than another dip to around the same levels). it will be fueled by people cashing out to surprise their families with lots of presents from their newly acquired money.
TDLR: buy little bits when shit is crashing, sell little bits when its booming and always recover your initial investment + interest

this is actually very relevant as an indicator of an all out crash. In the 08 recession, I was watching the bond market closely. In short, if people stop purchasing bonds because they are worried about the future then all hell would break loose and governments wouldn't be able to fund anything. However the reality is there is more than the globes annual GDP siting in bank accounts and they (insanely wealthy people and large investment groups) essentially need to purchase bonds to keep their money from depreciating in value against inflation. So, if things get to a point where the stock market is shit and the markets start crashing, the only place to go with your cash is the bond market and commodities like but not limited to gold.
Edit: additionally to relate back to the first comment: bitcoin is/can be seen by some as just another way to diversify a portfolio (assuming they know how to securely do it which more people are learning every day) which is somewhat how i see it but I also love it because it is much more interesting and could/will(hopefully) rewrite some economic principles dealing with money supply

cool so was using amazon to mine btc kind of a scummy thing to do or a smart thing to do
@_date: 2013-12-23 02:37:16
what is that, google failed me
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:52:51
good point but they could be just the tip of the iceburg

21 bitcoins is the magic number for me, in hopes that it one day becomes a trillion dollar currency, I will be able to have 10 million dollars and live comfortable for the rest of my life.
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:55:51
to the fucking moon! i see the relative price stability from the last substantial drop as a sign that btc could be here to stay
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:15:55
both are true: bitception
@_date: 2013-12-25 06:54:20
sadly a lot of the people that could benefit the most from btc don't have access to a computer :/ morbid reality
