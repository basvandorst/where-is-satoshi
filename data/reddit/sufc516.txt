I really want to start using the BitPay Card for daily purchases, my only apprehension is my affinity for credit card rewards. Do you have any intention of implementing a rewards program similar to those offered by credit cards or Samsung Pay?

Coincenter does exactly this. They are just really small and you can't expect them to have the same influence as AIPAC. If you want to change the way Bitcoin is treated, let Congress know that there are law abiding citizens who use Bitcoin and are willing to vote on it as single-issue voters.

In the eyes of the law, they are the same thing. Might I add, failing to comply with laws like you are doing harms the entire Bitcoin community. You are giving the people who say, "Bitcoin is only used by criminals" ammunition by willfully ignoring the rule of law and proving them right.

I suggest you do a little reading about what members of Congress are doing before making blanket statements and spreading FUD. Google the "Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act of 2017." It was introduced yesterday and doesn't touch on any of the power grabbing you are referring to.

Fair enough. I believe the Internet Association is international. It's too bad they don't do anything with cryptos. Coinbase is even one of their member companies.

No, the only thing the bill would do is create a de minimis exemption for small purchases (under $600). From the looks of it, it appears they want to encourage Bitcoin use and bring it further into the mainstream economy.

I get that you believe it shouldn't be taxed this way and I agree with you on that, but you are essentially admitting to tax evasion. Breaking the law and not getting caught is not the same as changing the system so it is no longer illegal in the first place.

It is a bill that would treat Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as foreign currencies, and would therefore alleviate the tax burden involved with transacting in Bitcoin. You would no longer be required to file a 1099 when you purchase say, a hard drive with Bitcoin. To answer your question, I would argue it is granting more freedom and removing regulations.

I would be concerned, if I were you. Grassley is the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Feinstein the Ranking Member. This bill is both bipartisan and was referred to the committee that the bill's sponsor chairs. If I were a gambling man, this bill is going to the floor for a vote.
