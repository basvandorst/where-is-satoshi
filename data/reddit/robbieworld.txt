This guy did a lot of good in Thailand. He distributed wealth out of Bangkok to the poorer northeast and introduced universal health care. That's why he was so popular with the poor, and hated by the elite. I'm sure he was corrupt, there isn't a single politician over there that isn't corrupt, but nevertheless in my opinion he did a lot of really good things for the country. You don't get kicked out and exiled for being corrupt in Thailand, it is the norm. You get kicked for upsetting the elite. Now they have a military dictator that wasn't chosen by the people and doesn't seem to want to give up the power.

Antonopoulos is consulting to them that gives me a little peace of mind. Also, if they want to leverage to shit and short it, they would either be taking an incredible risk, or they have the ability to manipulate the price. To manipulate the market they would first need to own a decent chunk of the market in order to create large sell orders. Do they already own significant amounts of btc? My opinion is that they don't, I may be wrong though. If they don't, then they have to acquire first driving the price up. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 05:28:55
Obviously Monopolcash.

Depends on your goals man. If you are OK to experience some dizzying highs and terrifying lows for 5 years you'll be ok. If you'll panic sell when your 50k hits 34k you're in the wrong game.
Time in the market is better than timing the market.

Remind yourself that you live in a country where you have enough food to eat, your house is warm in winter and cool in summer, you have friends family, education, sporting activities, an occasional holiday (maybe even overseas) and of course your health. If you had of invested more in early 2017 you'd still really value those things that actually make your life prosperous. Private jet or lambo would be nice though.
Edit: kind of assumed you live in a reasonable country.

In my opinion, our payment process are quite sophisticated and seamless. In busy Sydney food courts everyone just uses pay wave, it's quick and easy. Also, we have been without recession for a very long time, so I think people here have a fair amount of faith in the financial system. Having said that, the rise of bitcoin is getting people talking at the pubs. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:53:09

The worlds billionaires have a combined net worth north of $7 trillion. Those guys like to hedge and they have plenty of disposable income. That's only billionaires, i.e. 1000x millionaires. 
The worlds gold has an estimated value of more than $7 trillion. Bitcoin is a complimentary asset class with 21st century advantages. 
The worlds financial assets account for more than $290 trillion. Everybody wants a small part of their portfolio in something that has runway. Bitcoin has runway. People are going to hedge. 
Venezuela, a country of 30 million, has experienced hyperinflation exceeding 700% this year. Bitcoin is an exit strategy. 
Bitcoin doesn't need to replace all of this to be valuable. It only needs to supplement some of it.
Countries like Japan are accelerating adoption.
This is only the beginning.
 Edit: I copied this from someone else on here, not sure who, but I liked it. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 04:41:56
"The biggest problem I see with bitcoin – why I would never buy it – is that they could steal them from you. They hack into your phone…I know people who lost all their money like that".
Replace bitcoin with gold and hack your phone with rob your house. If that is the biggest problem we are doing alright!

I don't think QR would be as easy. Imagine two shops in a food court, both really popular with long lines. One, they are all tapping a card or their phone without waking it up. The other they are awakening their phone, opening an app, lining up the camera right potentially typing in the amount (depending on the payment system) etc etc.

It's not an investment so to speak as it produces nothing, no income.

There is already and will be more people using bitcoin who do not give a shit about it going up in value.
