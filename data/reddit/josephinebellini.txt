The registered 501 (c) (3) will sign off on the amount I have given them, and they also provide photos of the families that have been helped. I will share both of these! I’ve already spoken to them about bitcoin but they currently  do not accept it. If you would like to donate outside of buying the art, I can provide you the instructions to donate USD to their direct account. Please let me know if you have any other questions!

This is a painting of my incredibly brave friend, Mariana, from Venezuela. She recently moved to the United States and obtained political asylum status to escape the swiftly deteriorating situation in Venezuela. It is not just an economic crisis but a humanitarian crisis. I created this art to bring attention to the situation and to help the people of Venezuela. Even though this is a small gesture, anything we can do will help.  Here is a direct quote from Mariana. 
“Venezuela. Economic crisis is not all. It is the famine, the medicine shortage, the corruption, the political persecution, the unfairness, all the families separated, the deaths &amp; unfortunately there’s more. Venezuelans are suffering in an unimaginable ways because an unfair and illegitimate government. 
I’m Mariana Rojas Latouche and I was born and raised in Valencia, Venezuela. I left Venezuela in 2017 and now Im Political asylum granted in USA. I’m constantly talking about my country trying to make people outside of Venezuelan understand that everything is beyond news. Unfortunately my country has been collapsing for many years and it's getting worse. 
Josie Bellini made this work in consequence of all the mistreatment we are living. She got so interested in my culture and country that it inspired her to help. She decided to speak for us, to show the world how vulnerable we are. And she decided to help us in an remarkable way as donating all the profits of this piece of Art to a several Venezuelan Organizations that will help Venezuelan people in need.”
**The piece is hand painted, acrylic on canvas. The background is cut up Venezuelan Bolivares that are burned revealing the Bitcoin whitepaper. Limited edition of 50 prints.** 
**ALL proceeds are going to a charitable organization that sends boxes of baby formula and other lifesaving products directly to those in need.**

Thank you for your msg, but I see them differently. My piece “Filter” (with the gas mask and cut up money in the background) is meant to stimulate the conversation about how the government has unlimited power to print money, which really has no value, and total control over the money.  Bitcoin on the other hand, has a strict, totally transparent emission schedule which the user actually controls. So by putting on the bitcoin gas mask, it's as if you suddenly realized that the world (and fiat system) around you has been a lie and you are now "breathing in the truth."  The Bitcoin white paper is lined in the gas mask filters (in the original, not in this banner) and it "filters" out the dirty, corrupt fiat system.

No worries at all! Thank you. I’ll link a few ladies when I get to my computer. I have not done a solo gallery showing but I am interested in it in the future. Most likely in Chicago. I have been to a blockchain conference, and then a showing in Paris with other crypto artists.  
@_date: 2018-12-04 01:14:29
Will work on that!

Oh yeah, and the other one is named "Acceptance". This piece can swing either way in interpretation. Bitcoin has taken a few hits (if you measure success by market cap-- which you shouldnt, but most do), but I believe it will prevail. Others think Bitcoin will not end well. To each their own. We have to wait and see, but I am happy to bet on code &amp; math.

That one is named Nebula, and here is the meaning from my site "Nebula depicts the power and scale of the Ethereum network. The piece is lined with Ethereum whitepaper to signify its importance in the cryptocurrency market. The nebula, a natural phenomenon whereby new stars are created from a cloud of dust, parallels the Ethereum platform in which Dapps are built." 
Also up close, the eye that is in the nebula has the ETH logo in it. 
Your internship sounds awesome! I actually studied finance at a different school in Illinois, so I am self taught in art. But my financial background is what led me to finding bitcoin &amp; crypto. 
If you are still in Chicago, there is a amazing meetup I can suggest to you (Jameson Lopp is coming). And I think my art will be there as well.

I don't use myself as a model, however, I always have a woman as the focal point of my piece. I use different features from different muses that I find. I especially love Christina Nadin, and a few others if you would like me to share with you. 
I mostly use women as focal point of my art because, from my view, she balances the tech side of things (which is straight forward code/math). She brings it to life. She draws you in to take another look, and then you begin to notice her surroundings. Some pieces have hundreds of dollars ripped up in the background, others have repeating powerful symbols. I always try to make layers and layers of meaning within each piece.

That’d be pretty cool but no, they are large format conference banners. The twitter post is to win a archival print of who ever piece you like best :)
