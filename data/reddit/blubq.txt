Well. i have heared  of people winning two times in a row. and of a family where everyone but one person has won the lottery. i think it was a nordic EU family and 4/5 people won the lottery.
6 times in a row is highly unlikly but just remember: nothing is impossible

Actually if People would think like me then lotteries wouldnt exist.
I have never played any lotterie stuff because its not worth it. 
Just because I made a comment joking about something doesnt mean that thats how I think about something. ;)

Am I wrong or has gox not yet told anyone from their website that they are bankcrupt?
People who do not follow this subreddit and/or news agencys probably dont even know about gox being bankcrupt right?

Am I the only one who goes on those site to enter stuff like "suck my dick" and stuff like this as name/pw.
I also liked the way he asked for the email: "Lost your ID or password?"
I answered_ no
I guess I'm just a big kid

my wallet showed the transaction but his wallet at kraken.com didnt show it as it needed 6 confirmations. I thought that I could get faster confirms with a higher fee.
One week for a banking system transaction? 
Where do you live? Nigeria?
I recently transfered a few thousand € to start trading in bitcoins and it always took a day or two for the transaction (Wire transactions were a bit faster than SEPA tho)

Do you deliver to Germany?

lucky bastard ^^
I bought some bitcoins too... a few years ago. HDD crashed. I lost ~ 25€ worth in bitcoins at that time and I'd probably be a millionaire if it wasnt for that.
Make sure  you have multiple backups.

Does Kraken have some sort of live charts of selling/buying?
I found some charts on the site but they werent moving at all. or is that because there aint that many people trading there?
I was searching for something like this:

This morning when the price was at 1k i was like woah.. gonna buy 1,5 btc quick b4 work.
When i came home the price was... well what is it atm actually? every exchange seems to lag. but its far less .... well i guess nothing i can do there :P

But wont the times between found blocks get bigger as the difficulty increases? At some point the confirmations times would probably destroy the value of bitcoin or wouldnt it?
Edit: Or are there plans/mechanisms to reduce the difficulty by factor 1000 and also reduce the payout amount by factor 1000?
That would make sense in my opinion but hey... what do i know of this crypto things :P

I dont knowabout your country but in Germany many people dont work on the weekend.
So maybe just waiting for the next weekday could be your solution :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:32:09
then you better invest in bitcoins.
They might one day be worth something
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:32:19
You mean [this](
Dont panic if you see everyone selling for 1 minute and the price crashing.
It's always going up again :)
