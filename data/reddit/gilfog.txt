I wholeheartedly disagree. Australia gave out $1000 cash (in some cases $2000) to citizens during the recent financial crisis and it's the reason they escaped the crisis mostly unscathed. Giving the cash to the people would not cause massive inflation, that money is being printed regardless of where it goes. What do you think economic stimulus is?

Robocoin themselves state most ATM operators are raking in about $2000 a month. They should have recourse to sue for lost profits as well, I would say they have a clean cut case suing for 50k plus legal fees.

I saw a Robocoin ATM in a bar in Hong Kong. Each time I went to the bar (about 5 times over the course of 8 months) it was sitting in the corner gathering dust. I inquired of the barkeep each visit if it was working ("No", and asked when it would be up.

Private blockchains are the scam IMO. They're not much different than a database, and forfeit many of the innovations of the distributed tech. 
I'm not an Eth expert by far, and don't feel entirely qualified to argue for it. However it's not like these contracts are taking up memory while they're running, they're sending/receiving transaction and with a ~17 second block time that doesn't seem to be an issue in my mind.

Here is your legal recourse:
First send them a demand letter, stating you would like your Bitcoin. If no response you take them to small claims court. If you live in the US it's not difficult their office is in San Francisco, serve them papers (look up the laws on this you cannot do it personally) telling them you're taking them to court. Hire a process server if you must. If you live outside the US you'll probably have to hire an agent to represent you. Try Craigslist.

Did you download the drivers for it? In device manager make the miner shows up under "Ports" and shows as "Silicon Labs...". If it shows up under USB controllers re-do the driver via the zadig utility. 
To run it I made a shortcut on my desktop that points to ""C:\Users\User\Desktop\Open Me\cgminer-3.1.0-windows\cgminer-nogpu.exe" -o stratum.bitcoin.cz:3333 -u XXXX -p XXXX --icarus-options 115200:1:1 --icarus-timing 3.0=90 -S //./COM6".

It's another currency, so you can replace "Bitcoin" with "Peso" or "Yen". Does Yen make you real like money or is it just for transaction? Both. Bitcoin is still in its infancy and hasn't been recognized by most businesses or investors. It may never be accepted as everyday currency (similar to gold or silver, which has value but it is difficult to buy a pack of gum at Walmart using a gold nugget).

They are a cool thing to have. I have one just to play with, I built a custom heatsink for it (posted to r/bitcoin) and I'm going to overclock it. Fun stuff!!
@_date: 2013-09-17 06:50:35
Decided to make a new heatsink, as the old one got very hot at 166 degrees F. Copper was pricey so I used aluminum, cut it all by hand and riveted it to the board. 
Now it only gets to 96 degrees, a 42% decrease. No better hash rate, but it will help with cooling a great deal. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 04:22:09
The screenshot of CGMiner shows average hashrate of 497.1Gh/s, and a hardware error rate of roughly 5%. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 07:07:34
The heatsinks job is to pull heat away from the board. The stock heatsink is a block of metal, not very efficient. The fins allow better airflow so the metal cools faster, dissipating more heat, making the board cooler. 
If a pan had fins on the edges it would cool much faster as well, but pans are supposed to retain heat.

I riveted it on. The holes on the board were a bit small so I had to drill them out a bit (to 1/8").
Screws would have been better but tapping such a small hole is a bit difficult.

Good point. I colored a spot black and it does read about 3 degrees higher, so not too significant.
@_date: 2013-09-17 21:28:29
The measured difference is between the stock heatsink and the new one, ceteris peribus. I changed nothing else on the board.
