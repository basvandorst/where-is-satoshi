March 2013. The first thing I ever bought with Bitcoin was a single tab of LSD from the Darknet. 
It turned out to be a great decision.

Sorry, way to expensive. There are other services which offer Bitcoin payments at a discount....rather than charging me money to pay for something.
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:41:06
Me too! Finally had a reason to implement it...and the solution is much easier than first thought. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 20:07:10
I xposted it to if others are interested in seeing a solution found: 
@_date: 2015-08-10 08:54:08
Good luck with enforcing that.

That's cool and all, but this probably is money he got from selling merchandise at his shows. So unless people attending are prepared to pay in Bitcoin it won't really help him. Or he would need someone in every country he attends to exchange half a million in cash on the fly into Bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't quite ready for that.

Mycelium local trader too, maybe just a coincidence, but still.

But I use linux?

@_date: 2015-04-02 11:18:27
Not really. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 11:21:47
Your mistake is talking about it. Your freedom isn't safe if they are coming after your money and now know where (or how) it is being hidden away from them. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:59:30
Lets hope. Finished my goal of reaching the one million club one week ago, it has been all uphill from there. To the mewn!
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:47:35
Why does this bother people?
@_date: 2015-03-03 12:36:07
Apples and Oranges. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 11:55:02
21 BTC exactly. Which are 1/1000000 of the BTC that will ever be in circulation. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:19:35
Isn't that like....a year old though?
@_date: 2015-03-01 10:22:52
Strange, I use Windows 8 myself and have had no issues with Trezor so far. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 13:33:20
It's called side by side and streams on Netflix CA &amp; US. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:40:53
The background doesn't really bother me as much as it seems to bother others, but the music, really wtf. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:46:50
haha I know right!
*75 BTC Bounty for head*!

Bitcoin is kill

I'd research 2-FA a bit more so you actually know what is going on when you use it and don't have to call it 2-step-thingy :). 
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:23:47
Maybe we'll go so low that $100 will be the new moon?! 
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:54:13
Yes and no.
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:44:42
[Hey OP I like you.](
@_date: 2015-02-26 07:57:49
Definitely not. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 08:46:08
It was a long time ago when I last checked, but if I remember correctly  big power sellers and stores who sell on eBay have a much lower fee. So as a small time seller you are also dealing with those stores bringing down the prices and undercutting you while you are stuck with the high fees. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:14:15
I am not sure which fees applied, but about 7 years ago I was selling items on eBay through PayPal and had to quit because the fees where getting so ridiculously high. And I had my PayPal and eBay account frozen for trying to accept bank transfers. Since then been selling on local sites and have zero fees except perhaps my bank fees. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:58:21
You must think you are smart.
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:47:28
I doubt that EU laws are ok with this. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 10:20:15
I hardly see it as an issue. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:28:26
Bionic legs fuck yeah!

Reddit obviously. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 10:42:45
Yes ofcourse it is. That is if you hold some sort of fundraiser and get together a few hundred thousand or million to set up a mining factory. Then spend only about 10% on the actual mining equipment, blow the rest on blow, expensive prositutes and cars. Then you just declare the Bitcoin market too volatile and tell people you did not expect the difficulity to rise as quickly as it did. For some extra points you can also offer some cloud mining for a steady flow of income from idiots who have no idea what ponzi they are investing in. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:49:08
And this was the most original thing they could come up with?
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:26:10
If you want to be a Bitcoin innovator you best not live in the US. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:17:50
Nothing is clear until we have heard the other side of the story. 
OP; a Redditor for 10 days could very well be talking out of his ass. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:01:10
They are, correct me if I am wrong but I am pretty sure that EU regulations require AML/KYC information on customers of exchanges and banks. Italian central bank can say no, but the Italian central bank has to abide by the European central bank's regulation. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 11:54:06
He did and he does. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:22:50
The PayPal fees are the worst thing ever. Had a semi successful business on eBay until PayPal started messing around with fees, and also froze my accounts. Such a terrible company. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 18:52:55
Well of course, it is not in our interest to make Bitcoin look bad in any way or shape! Bitcoin good, fiat bad, look, it's something that has nothing to do with Bitcoin but is totally actually good news for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:04:40
But in the big scheme of things how much money is $1bn on a global market? It is still a very tiny amount, there are single entities who have many times more than what was stolen in the hack. If you go by the entire circulation and percentages I am sure that more BTC have been stolen just in the last 12 months than in the last 5 years through banking. MTGox alone accounted for 6%(!). 
@_date: 2015-02-04 12:12:13
I think you are forgetting something. Exchanges do have a minimum age, and it isn't exactly the best thing for minors to go meet up with random people LBC to buy BTC. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:18:48
I disagree. Never lost my sleep over worrying the BTC price going up, but have lost lots worrying I would wake up to a price crash. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:38:03
I don't use Bitcoins as an investment, I keep fiat on exchanges so I can purchase services or products which have the option to pay with Bitcoin. Ofcourse, the price going up is cool, but losing a few dozen to hundreds of Euro overnight really sucks.

A trojan cannot magically decrypt an encrypted wallet. That is unless the password is weak, was stored somewhere on the PC or typed in on the same machine during the time it was infected. It might sound unbelievable, but one of those things most certainly happened.
