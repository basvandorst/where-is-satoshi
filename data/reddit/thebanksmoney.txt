If this is true then eventually the entire supply of bitcoins would become &lt;used for evil&gt; therefore useless. The entire point of decentralized technology is so nobody can freeze or take your assets. Nothing about bitcoin can determine intentions of goods bought or sold with the currency. Who deems spending btc anywhere or receiving btc can become a ‘invalid’ transaction because some country deems it tainted. That’s a ethical or moral problem not a technical one. Laws change and things legal one day become illegal another and vice-versa. If I receive say $100 usd for selling a gold rock neither the receiver nor can I guarantee either exchange has been used for something deemed dirty. For all I know the gold rock was used to murder an Neanderthal and the USD was used to put a hit on somebody for murder. There is no way to determine why I am receiving bitcoin only that I received it . It’s like a credit card company knowing what I will do with the chainsaw I buy. Yes, it’s on the record but nobody knows if I will throw it away or use it to do harm.  Just my thoughts. If btc can be taken away then it fails. Granted , the FBI could seize your coins , but only if they have your keys.

Agreed, it would be like buying a tv for 1 bitcoin and finding out watching the news with newly purchased tv that 1 bitcoin can now buy 5 TVs . DAI makes more sense to me. Unless, the point is one day after all coins are in supply the price will sit at constant price .

Miners determine the success or failure. (I.e it was setup so that if something better comes along all the computing power would go there) so yes!
