Also, did not know people were dumb enough to sell paper wallets on ebay... WTF!

It is indeed the semi opaque property of the top sheet in this case. Stuff on your screen can't be made see-through.
Much like how a white t-shirt becomes almost transparent when wet. In the case of t-shirts (especially if there's a picture taken with flash), you tend to be able to change the levels to see what's underneath.
But as a general rule of thumb, I'd recommend against taking pictures or screenshots of sensitive data. A partial QR code might be reconstructable, or there might be something else open getting in the image too.

Problem is more the private key QR code this person thought he'd hidden by placing the note over it. Some basic tinkering with the rgb levels shows it's still there. I didn't want to take it all the way to scannable, but I guess it was enough for the OP if this picture to take the original down.

No worries, and yes I would assume cardboard would be sufficient. Windows on a screen tend to be fully opaque. This is very much a physical attack vector indeed.

I should have posted a link to the original post which seems to have been deleted in the mean time. The original post was just a picture of a stack of paper wallets. People tend to not know cameras can pick up things *behind* paper, which might not show directly but can be enhanced later.
And QR codes (with their error correction and such) are made to be functional even if part is not visible.
TL;DR: Don't take pictures of your private QR codes ever, even if you think you're covering them up.
