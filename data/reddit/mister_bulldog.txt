Exactly. People talk through these hypothetical scenarios, but forget that they would likely have cashed out 1,000 times on the way to where we are now. Not only that, it would have been a good decision given the information they had at the time.

Touche. Nonetheless, that sort of moronic thinking is common enough that I took it at face value. For example, see the "oxymoron" comment further down the thread.

I had my BTC on CoinBase at the time of the Bitcoin Gold fork. I feel like they screwed their customers over. What is the best way (besides a hardware wallet) for me to park my BTC somewhere I'll be able to benefit from any forks going forward? (*I am interested in a hardware wallet eventually, but doubt I can get my hands on one before the ~12/28 Segwit2x fork*)
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:15:30

So straight people are 95-97% of the population. And so it's surprising there are more examples of straight people with proven intelligence? You are aware Leonardo Da Vinci was gay right? And from your comment, I think we can safely assume you are dumb as a bag of rocks.

First, why Do you capitalize Random words? That is a classic Sign of an Idiot. Second, your statement is the equivalent of saying "Saw an estimate that said Donald Trump is the 65th President." It's beyond retarded. It can be disproven by 1) simple elementary school math or 2) a quick google search. There are ~16M bitcoins floating around. Each one is worth about ~$US 14K It's multiplication. Do they not teach it in schools anymore?

When the news has been too good for too long and you start to get this nervous feeling in your stomach, like anxiety from too much good news b/c you're waiting for the other shoe to drop, THAT'S when you sell (if you want to do the trading shit). Never sell cause bad news (price droppage) is scaring you.

"Triggered" &lt;---- found the D-bag... 
People are celebrating because something they are invested in bounced back from a rough decline. It didn't reverse the damage but the downward spiral seems to have stopped. "A few hundred bucks" seems a little obtuse when we are talking about something that went down to $5,800 earlier this week and then was at $8,500 when you made your comment. Some might call that "a few thousand dollars." You act amazed that there are memes on the bitcoin subreddit. What did you expect? Memes on a subreddit?!?!??! What will they think of next?!!??!

People have been using Bitcoin to buy weed on the black market and at state-regulated pot shops for years. Because federal laws prevent consumers from buying pot with credit/debit cards, crypto has provided a roundabout means for pot shops to allow consumers to use credit/debit cards.

Your use of the word sarcasm is incorrect. You were clearly not being sarcastic when you said that my excessive punctuation shows that I'm triggered. Maybe you were jabbing at me merely for the sake of jabbing, but that is not sarcasm. Nonetheless, you are in a forum full of people who saw their very significant profits evaporate in the span of a month. I'm still in the green, but yes, you are correct, my portfolio has lost a mind boggling amount of weight in the last month. Yes, it is stressful. You prancing around this forum boasting how you pulled your money out at the perfect moment and how everyone here is so foolish to celebrate a modest bounce back from the downward spiral-- it's just the shitty behavior of a garbage person. Whatever pleasure you get from I-told-you-soing and twisting the knife for those who just want to find some silver lining, it really represents the worst part of people. I see little gremlins like you all over this sub, and to all of you I say [this](

Well, it's easy to say that now that we know what the bottom was. Also, it's psychologically harder to buy back in again than to hold. Also, there is a thing called long-term capital gains tax. If I keep my investment on the market for 364 days, it is taxed at a significantly lower rate, incentivizing me to hold. Also, time-in beats timing. Also, stop calling it Hodl'ing. It's fucking stupid.
