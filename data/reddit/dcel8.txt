Yeah i dunno about Tim Draper, dont feel his words really carry any weight anymore, dont get me wrong, Bitcoin investor/holder/enthusiast here, all postive news is great, but his speculations are becoming a little pretentious and a little delusional

If you personally know bitcoin holders/investors etc perhaps offer to purchase off them via cash, download a wallet that doesnt require any sort of kyc/id validation such as Jaxx or coinomi and start from there

I started investing in Bitcoin in 2013 straight after the Mt Gox incident, i started investing in Bitcoin during a very long bearish market, i would invest just a little bit at a time, perhaps about 50 bucks or so a week/fortnight, always invest what you can afford and to this day, i still invest about $50 a week/fortnight, i believe in the tech and also believe in its potential value, I think Bitcoin has a long way to go, not in regards to value, but its evolution of its current technological state. As they always say, invest in what you can afford to lose, dont buy into Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies as a quick rich scheme by gambling way more then you can afford which many unfortunately have, be patient fellow holder, planting seeds will not grow trees over night, give it time to flourish

stupid question, so lets says someone who owns a million bitcoins suddenly dies, a million bitcoins will be gone, would that somehow increase the value of bitcoin because of scarcity?
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:51:45
that will be bitcoin when it completely hits the mainstream
