If right this second you wanted 1 full bitcoin, you'd have to shell out about $7,600.  I understand you're excited to start buying bitcoin, but dont start going crazy.  Put in a little bit at a time, whatever you can afford to potentially lose, because nothing is certain.  Dont be taking overage checks from college loans and pour it into bitcoin or anything silly like that.  The price a year ago was under $4,000 and could easily return to this range.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:58:01
Yeah just keep doing that, and the thing is, the lower the price bitcoin goes, the more bitcoin your 5-10$ will buy.

Who knows man, I just think bear market to now "bull" market happened way too fast, market cycles generally dont work like that, but we are ultimately at the hands of the market makers, and they can shake the price around wherever they want for as long as they want, until more and more people start buying and they have less control, but that is far away I'm afraid.
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:23:08
Well we have defined, confirmed bearish divergence on a macro scale.  Mild hidden bullish divergence isnt a thing.
@_date: 2019-08-27 17:11:28
You are right with higher lows, but even if we break up out of the triangle, I fear we will just set another lower high on the macro trend, even if it comes to that.

Open up a coinbase account where you will have a btc and ltc wallet.  Send the smallest amount of coin to each wallet and see which one receives it.  Not sure if there is another way to tell, but this seems like the easiest way to figure it out.

First of all I'm not doing TA, second, the price of bitcoin isnt being driven by hodlers lol, it's being driven by people who hold large amounts of bitcoin and are buying and selling for profit, preying on people that are buying at these prices, then selling, and causing said fomoers to panic sell for a loss.

Preparing is fine but it's not realistic, I could be totally wrong, but I dont like it, and there's no TA that's going to confirm for me right now that this market is a bull market.  Look at the chart, we are in a descending wedge on a macro scale, inherently bearish.  Not to mention we set a lower high on the overall macro scale from Dec. 2017, scary.  Do you not realize that from 3k to 14k was a parabola?  What do parabolas do?  Do they continue an unrealistic upward trend?  Yeah, that's healthy.  We had a bull run, but we are not in a bull market, imo.

As long as you're not carrying the passphrase along with you I dont see the issue.  If you lose the device, well, your out a hundred bucks.  Not sure where you live, but I have my recovery speed buried on my land with GPS coordinates lol.  Not sure about the trezor security, but afaik, ledger nano is quite safe.  That's why you should have more than one device, just in case you lose it, then by the sheer chance that the person who finds it even knows what it is, and then is able to actually hack it, you will already have recovered your assets.
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:30:43
Not really familiar with trezor, I have ledger and they are hard to crack, not sure if you could even do it.  You would have to get extremely unlucky to lose the device, have some one find it that knows what it is, and at the same time is a mastermind hacker with the likes of felicity smoak.
@_date: 2019-08-18 08:13:18
We've been in a bearish structure for at least a month now, so imo we've set a higher low at just under 14k, from 20k at the end of 2017, sorry to say, but we are going way lower than 8k. 
Correction from 12k has been materialized lol?  Are you serious?  The entire pump from 3k has been materialized from tether.  Stop being a goon and think realistically.
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:18:50
I dont disagree but that's not even the point of my post.  No one has attempted to even entertain my hypothesis, they just come with snarky hodl remarks, hodl yes, but that's not the point for RIGHT now, people are buying whole bitcoins right now, and 95% of them are buying thinking they are going to make quick money, they aren't going to hodl, they are going to sell when the market pressures them to sell.
@_date: 2019-08-26 14:10:44
Btc has dropped below 10k at least 5 times in the recent weeks, and someone always says this.  Support only holds for so long, especially when said asset is setting lower highs on a macro scale.  You can say and think what you want, but understand that you are saying and thinking without reason, and with zero knowledge of how markets work.

@_date: 2019-08-11 15:11:22
Your missing the point, let's not even start there. Let's start here, bitcoin is right now setting lower highs on a macro scale, everytime the bulls try to push it up they get rejected.  Look at the chart.  13.8k rejected, almost 13k, rejected, 12.xxk rejected, and now were in a descending wedge on a MACRO scale.  
Now, you're going to have to scroll out on your chart, draw a trend line from 20k to the recent high at just under 14k, and look at the trendline, that's where we are headed in the large macro trend, until we fully bottom out, this may take a year.
@_date: 2019-10-06 06:00:53
Yeah that would totally be natural and sustainable growth.

If you swing trade btc you can make money no doubt, people say actual TA is useless, but it's not if you look at structure, support, resistance, fib lines etc.  It all tells a story, the story I'm trying to tell is that we are not in a bull market, and no one seems to get it.

I see what youre saying, but what you're failing to realize is that it took bitcoin nearly 3 years to get to that point from its previous ath.  So where bitcoin was going up in June-Oct 2016 is actually where we are right now in 2014, that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:43:36
10 years would be the large macro trend of bitcoin, so yes you are correct.  The entire chart as a whole, and if you look at it like that, then that's fine, but 0.01%  of people interested in bitcoin look at it that way, and it's not realistic looking at it like that anyway.

Trend and structure, on a micro scale (daily/weekly) provides confluence in areas if you are looking at them.

After we reach our ultimate bottom, we need slow and steady growth.  Bull runs are no good, they are parabolas that shoot straight up, and are in no way shape or form sustainable, and crash back down.  Bull market is what you want to see, slow, positive growth of an asset that shows signs of increasing adoption and demand for said asset.

@_date: 2019-06-29 09:13:08
Institutions are not people like you and me.  They are entities with liabilities and insurances.  You understand large players in this game can literally make the price go how they want with enough capital.  Especially how illiquid the market was a few months ago.  They are buying at this level, they've been buying since 3200, but only to profit off of dumb money, and it wont keep up, hence the recent heinous volatility.
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:14:02

Well explain what a parabola is.  What happens in a parabolic uptrend in a market?  It returns to a mean.  When the parabolic uprise  is unsubstantiated, which bitcoins was, there was no reason for it, and now we are seeing that with heinous volatility.

People have been saying this for years.
@_date: 2019-06-29 10:50:29
Meet you there
@_date: 2019-12-06 11:36:16
Bought at 10k, rode that train all the way to 20k
@_date: 2019-12-06 08:15:12
What truth?  That bitcoin can do what it is meant to do?
@_date: 2019-12-14 19:04:50
No, I'll beat it, that's it.
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:10:39
No, they didn't create a parabola immediately.  Dont think you know what your talking about bro, how about YOU go back and look at the charts and tell me how many days were in between those bear markets and even the START of a bull market.  This is not a normal happening.
@_date: 2019-12-20 10:51:40
No one said that
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:43:55
You can claim losses yes, up to $3000 per fiscal year.
@_date: 2019-12-06 08:17:38
How exactly will it have an impact?
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:25:01
The law of shitcoin - if it ain't bitcoin, it shitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-18 18:08:46
Because nobody knows that's why, anything anyone says is pure speculation.
@_date: 2019-12-12 17:12:12
If you sell your bitcoin for fiat currency, you have to pay taxes on the profit, if you plan on being tax compliant.  This is not new(s).
@_date: 2019-12-29 18:41:57
Hows that spinach taste?
@_date: 2019-12-14 10:33:20
If it's not over 100k, then it will probably be zero, or a few dollars at most.
@_date: 2019-06-29 09:58:03
I've heard a lot of millionaires lurk these forums...
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:51:04
Obviously no one knows but based on indicators you can have a slight gauge on where the market is heading, the NVT is oversold to the extreme and has never been inaccurate.  Can you tell me with a straight face (text) that this parabolic rise from 3k is normal or organic in any sense of the phrase, please, I'd love to hear what you have to tell me. 
Have you not seen the heinous volatility in the market once we hit the .68 fibonacci?  Whales are cashing out.  The entities that made bitcoin go up from 3k are starting to cash out, and they are profiting from idiots that are fomoing in.  I've seen several posts on reddit about idiots saying they just bought into bitcoin and are crying that it went down because they were trying to make a quick buck.  I'm sorry, but if you think this is a bull market and not a bear market rally, then you can get burned too.
@_date: 2019-09-01 23:20:58
Let's see these arithmetics, because looking at charts, specifically structure, support and resistance lines, etc, would disrespectfully disagree.
@_date: 2019-09-02 00:12:25
You, I believe.
@_date: 2019-09-19 14:02:17
They know the same as you and me.
@_date: 2019-09-14 17:40:39
And 365+ days until we see a price higher than 20k
@_date: 2019-09-15 02:39:27
Well it's not about predicting the future it's about trying to get an edge on the market.  We've set nothing but lower highs for the last 4 months, what is bullish about that to you
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:17:20
Not if you can afford it, I'm not saying do it, because obviously I think the price is going down.  I could buy bitcoin right now, but I'm confident in my analysis of the market.  Even for those that already bought, if you have a whole bitcoin, or even half, and you plan to hold it for a few years, you'll be good, but I want to be more than good.
@_date: 2019-09-15 08:27:45
Yeah but hes saying having the same keys for both devices, unless I'm not understanding correctly.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:21:07
10x from ATH?  Probably not that high, but when/if it breaks ATH, there's no telling where it could go, but we aren't close to that yet.
@_date: 2019-09-19 19:06:23
Can I not has bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-04 05:04:42
@_date: 2019-09-06 08:49:02
Um, no, they're not.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:09:15
You usually do that, I know your bullish, good call
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:07:03
Sorry you bought at 14k
@_date: 2019-09-02 23:31:14
@_date: 2019-09-15 15:18:49
Must still be hodling from 20k
@_date: 2019-09-01 20:42:33
All these so called experts predicting price I dont understand their mindset.  There has to be some ulterior motive for them to be making claims like this.  Whether it's an attempt to prop up the market and incentivise buying because an "expert" said it's going to go up, pfft.  Garbage, nonsensical, non realistic propaganda to get people to buy in, ridiculous.  Bitcoin is treading water, and is in dangerous territory of retracing completely on this macro trend.  More than a 2 month descending wedge creating lower highs, inheritenly bearish.  People think bitcoin is changing the world RIGHT NOW, well I got news for you, it isnt, it's still highly speculative.
@_date: 2019-09-14 06:18:32
November 8700, sounds about right.
@_date: 2019-09-11 13:46:06
Who cares? This descending wedge is exactly the same as the one back when we capitulated to 3k.  It can only break 10k and recover so many times.
@_date: 2019-09-11 13:56:03
If we get to that level, who knows what could happen from there, not out of the realm to double bottom at 3k or go lower, complete market cycle from this years parabolic runup.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:06:22
Brushed earlier, so nope, wrong again.
@_date: 2019-09-14 15:45:02
Personally, I would buy 1, maybe 2, basically as insurance, because long term you will be good with 1 or 2, but I believe the price is going to drop significantly in the next year, but that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:51:21
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:49:02
Been dead wrong?  How?  I know what I posted in June, I didn't say it was going to happen in a week.  And where are we months later, same spot.  The lows I'm talking about wont be here for probably another year.  But do what you want moonboy, you'll be the one crying and deleting your reddit account when I come back to say I told you so.
@_date: 2019-09-15 01:11:19
Look at the chart, we've been in a bearish descending wedge formation for months now.  The last time btc was in this type of structure, it capitulated 50% to the downside.  A large move is going to happen very soon, if we break down, that will be confirmation for me that the bears are undeniably in control of this market.
@_date: 2019-09-14 18:32:16
Why would you want 2 with the same keys?  That's the point of the wallet, its secure.  If you're paranoid you would spread your wealth on the 2 devices, and have a third if something happened to one of them so you could recover your assets.  There's zero point of having two devices if they have the same private keys, I dont even know how you would do that.  You would literally have 2 devices with assets, but basically 1 because it's the same keys, makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:11:51
Well hodl would be fine, but people dont hodl, they say they do, and then sell when it gets unbearable, no pun intended
