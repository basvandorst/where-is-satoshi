What do you mean by "non fiat"? Sorry about the dumb question.

Yeah... And now here I am, thinking about buying 1 bitcoin at $4.3k. I had the opportunity to buy it at $30....

Oh, I'll buy it now. Just looking on what are the specifics on getting to it here, as I'm located in Brazil. Not sure if I can make the transfer/use Poloniex.
Also, just need to do a little research on the security of my wallet.

I have 0.1eth from mining, actually. Lol. But I'm looking to buy something around $5k. Thanks for the info!

The point is, that if you want to launder money, you won't receive _any_ cash from someone that isn't yourself.
You make a "laundromat", don't have any customers, but throw in the books that you made $3.000 in that day, and voilá, you have 3.000 of bad cash, paytaxes on it, and you laundered it.
It does not make any sense taking money from _someone else_, in cash, to launder it. You only take cash if you don't want it to show up in the books. Laundering money is the direct opposite.

That doesn't work like that.
Laundering money means _bringing bad cash into the books_, not removing it. That is just tax evasion.
Also, fuck those businesses. Why is it my problem if the guy can't handle his cash flow and his working capital?

One reasonable person! Thanks. Have my upvote, sir.
