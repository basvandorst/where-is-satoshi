TLDR: Current financial system is inefficient and yet collects trillions in transaction fees annually. So called "fintech" startups are working on creating solutions for this. The blockchain is the more exciting tech at London Business School conference, with potential for secure way to transact, yet currently lacking capability to handle high volumes. Both concerns of user privacy on one end, and concerns of difficulty tracking financial activity for purposes of catching tax evasion/money-laundering are mentioned. Also mentioned alternate use of the blockchain, i.e. tracking land registries. With negative interest rate policies potentially soon having effect on individual consumers, appeal of digital currencies may increase exponentially.

*Exchanges have a vested interest in keeping tight security so they are probably more secure than casual user who likes to run random apps on their phone/PC. But the risk is that they can still get hacked since they are a bigger target, or they could abscond with people's funds.

On exchanges, like LocalBitcoins, or Kraken, or whatever, the exchange has complete control over spending "your" bitcoins. If you were to use a proper wallet (I don't know much about Copay) which does not share control of spending keys with ANYONE, then this is generally* better.
*Exchanges have a vested interest in keeping tight security so they are probably more secure than casual user who likes to run random apps on their phone/PC. But the risk is that they can still get hacked since they are a bigger target, or they could abscond with people's funds.

I actually wouldn't mind if BTC was a store of value settlement layer. If the fee is going to be $1 or less it would still be great. Yeah, I've used bitcoin to buy stuff on purse.io and it works, but what if there's a need to return the item, or there is some other issue that comes up? It's just not ready for retail.
People seem to bring up the point that BTC needs to be a savior for the 3 billion unbanked or whatever (as if they give a shit), and unless that happens then we will never see $x/per BTC (their true motive). Perhaps. I don't know if bringing bitcoin to 7.2B people is necessary to reach $x/BTC. What I do know, is that many many people cannot use bitcoin at the same time because of its technical capacity limitations.

Don't do that. The point of bitcoin is not that it made some people very rich and the audience should not get any such ideas.
@_date: 2016-10-31 05:22:39
I'm saying it could have remained the same from last week, so the new all time high doesn't mean demand went up.

Scarcity is not the only feature. I can make something very unique, like 3 in the whole world, very scarce, but still it will not have much value.

You implied it. Why would you post a storage item in bitcoin sub?

You sound like price going up is guaranteed. It isn't guaranteed and people should not rely on that happening.
@_date: 2016-10-24 02:51:11
Fees have no effect on when the block is found so that is not relevant. If you want to be in the very next block you have to pay for that to happen.

If you're being good and expecting a reward for it you're doing it wrong.

Why is underutilization of block space bad? Miners are paid their reward regardless, so with 'all you can eat' pricing stuffing it is the way to go.
@_date: 2016-10-11 04:16:13

It's more related to an interface with traditional banks.

No. Selling appreciated assets for profit is not a "skill" or "occupation." If asked to explain the gap say successful investments produced income and allowed opportunity to travel, etc.

This is not good. Gambling is fine but attaching it directly to bitcoin.com website cheapens the concept of bitcoin.

Congress saying "pay for your employee's retirement" is equated to congress "stealing all their money?" The structure is messed up, but the idea is pretty sound. Cover employees or don't hire them in the first place.

Blockchain is just a linked list, there's nothing revolutionary about that data structure. The addition of distributed verification and proof of work is what makes it different. Nodes don't receive small payouts. Nodes don't receive anything. Miners do. Today they mine for the subsidy reward of newly issued bitcoins, not for transaction fees. And for all the potential ideas mentioned - don't forget that there is no room in the blocks for any of that.

Often see some handwavey claims that in a crisis (weakness in sha256, miners don't conform, etc) we can replace the hashing algo.
How easy is that? And how reasonable? Hard fork? So then.. very hard. And wouldn't new proof of work algo make bitcoin not bitcoin anymore? And finally, wouldn't the imminent hash rate drop (assuming new algo  is GPU friendly at best - no ASICs) allow adversaries like banks and govs to subvert the "new" bitcoin for relatively low cost?

There is a risk that it will not. Over a decade a lot could change, hard forks, etc, making some types of transactions invalid. Keep the private keys, which defeats the purpose of time locking but at least you won't lose access to your coins.
