I wanna buy 1 dollar worth of doge now just to say I have some. Edit:  where’s the best exchange for buying it?

Selling is for the weak.  I’m riding this baby down to hell and back!!!

That would be the dopest dip ever.  Sell at 19k buy all back at 190.  Goes back to 19k next week. ��

I get it up to step 4.  I was trying to do this a few days ago.  I successfully transferred Bitcoin into Gdax and was trying to deposit that money into my bank it didn’t work. My bitcoin balance stayed the same on Gdax.  I think I’m talking about a separate thing here but is this possible to do without fees?

Whenever I get nervous I change the timeline on the graph from 1 day to one year.  It puts everything in perspective.  It was at $800 for 1 bitcoin a year ago.

Who is saying that? Why are they saying that?  No one knows the future but i've seen dips like this happen countless time and i've only been in since this summer.  Just my thoughts on it.  If it were me I wouldn't have put in my entire bank account because I would be too stressed no matter what the market was doing.  So best case scenario: Wait til it gets back to 16700 then sell but keep a smaller amount in that you won't be worried if you lose it.  Just how I would do it.  Good luck.

I say keep it on the wall as a reminder of where it was at the beginning.

A lot of us do.  All the crypto in my account is just profit from last year so I’m just having a few beers and hanging out!

I just rated it 5 stars and gave it a nice review.  Only took a few minutes.  Do it!

I think they hoard it.

I totally agree!  When the dip happened in September I couldn’t sleep.  I like the idea of selling small amounts until I have all my original investment back and then just holding forever.
