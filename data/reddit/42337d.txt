what a scumbag.  legitimately the worst thing to bitcoin and crypto.  i respect jamie dimon 10x than this thing we call roger ver

bullish!!  every time these status quo fuckers come out criticizing btc, it makes it ever more clear that their businesses are in jeopardy.  they keep making tired old arguments about beanie babies and tulips to muddy the waters in an attempt to scare off newbies.  the problems they mention are solvable over time.  furthermore, their "business" is the one that has tons of risk, scams, and trust problems (leading to regulatory action, fines, and new laws).
just remember that every disruptive change in history has had these types of dipshits on the opposing side trying everything they can to stop progress and maintain control.

Technically maybe not collusion as that would imply some  some law was broken.  Conspiracy may be a better word

Bcash is an alt coin, forked off of Bitcoin like many others.  Bcash in particular is not decentralized, as a certain mining hardware manufacturer, Roger, and a few other douchebags have colluded to hijack the Bitcoin name and fuck with what makes Bitcoin decentralized.  They attack the real Bitcoin by spamming the network, while they add code to their alt coin to allow for the fuckery (Satoshi's whitepaper has nothing about implementing EDA).  Eventually people will realize what is going on as the crypto world grows and matures.  You think Roger is going to hold down the fort while rogercoin gets exposed?  He's gonna take a fat dump on everyone and their paper gains in bcash.

Roger will try his damndest to make the most money as possible for himself, while screwing over the masses.  He is the Donald Trump of crypto.  He has large holdings of both and likely rides the pumps he creates with a large percentage of his holdings to stack up.  Even if bcash fails, he will come out much richer than he is now.

What the punch line is?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:26:43
Haha... It's petty to call out a scam artist deliberately trying to misinform the public for to benefit his own self interest, harming the bitcoin community in a bitcoin subreddit?
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:23:41
they have been doing this for quite some time.  try a google search.  shittrex users beware

Good I hope I am harming the bcash community

Agreed on the point about the retracement.  This gives everyone a breather for price discovery and a sanity check.  I actually thought it would dip more.  If this is what BTC pullbacks are gonna be looking like after massive runs,  good times ahead

Coinbase is not bitcoin..   Fiat is anonymous, but banks have verifications to use their services.   Coinbase policies not have any bearing on the tech

there are too many people i talk to that have some interested in bitcoin, but don't want to get in because it is too expensive now, and they are more interested in eth or ltc because it's more in their price range.  facepalm
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:47:53
umm, clearly his stock broker did NOT know what he was talking about.  time has that thing of revealing the truth, and so far his "expert" was massively wrong.  his friend missed a chance to more than double his 10k in less than a month, but talked him out of it (i would say most likely due to this stock broker's ignorance on technology in general, and persistence on sticking with the status quo).  Unless your typical stock broker has done their due diligence on the fundamentals of the technology, the global adoption, and human psychology in the matter, i would not listen to them.  they are obviously incentivized to have you invest in their shit.

Chill out it's just humor
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:23:33
triggered?  no, it's just that everyone that i talk to who continue to remain in denial about btc being a great investment for the most part fall into one of two camps..
1) they are non-tech savvy people, who also exhibit this arrogant ignorance about stuff they don't know about.  like since they don't understand it, it must be a fad.  they are usually surrounded by other fools who "heard" that it is an unsafe investment so they go by that.
2) they didn't get in earlier on, feel it's too expensive now, and are doubling down on it failing one of these days.  these are the people who think you need to buy a whole bitcoin.
it would be like someone who didn't understand how stock markets worked, and a stock expert giving them advice on where to invest, and the person laughing and replying that the stock market is all a scam, and that only tangible assets can have real value.

@_date: 2017-09-02 14:58:21
well, i that is how i talk to i guess i am just an ass.  why would i be angry that a friend of some random stranger on reddit lost out on a good opportunity?
right now there are too many noobs popping on the scene with no zero experience in investing, trading, or technology that have made some money and think they are geniuses because they know how to pick red or black... with that said there are also too many stock trader "experts" popping on the scene who are just as annoying.
do i think someone who has never been able to consistently save money in their life, drop $10k on something they don't have a good understanding of as an investment?  no that would not be sound advice.  what the person does with the $20k he would have today would be just as important, if not more.
all i am saying is that it is clear by now that btc is disruptive technology.  since when has there been a tradition stock with this kind of disruptive force?  the traditionalists fail to factor this part in and think they are giving "sound" advice to others who might actually be onto something.
