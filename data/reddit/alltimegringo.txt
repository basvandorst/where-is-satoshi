give it a couple months and you'll only be griping about missed profits instead of losses

Yes, much of it.


The only way social security will fail is if politicians refuse to fund it.


It's not a ponzi scheme.


I'm 37 and my whole family would be dead right now if we hadn't received social security survivor benefits after my dad died when I was 6 months old so I'll gladly continue paying into the program so others can avoid that fate as well. No charity or benefactor was going to give us 10s of thousands of dollars every year for 18 years to keep us out of the gutter, but social security did.

missed profits from timing the market wrong, i.e., if you'd bought several days later, you'd have gotten more coins for your buck
if you were to sell now, in a couple months you'd be griping about both losses *and* missed profits

If hundreds and hundreds of people went into the sub talking about how X investment was going to afford them a Lambo when it grows by 10x in the next five years and how anyone who disagrees is a dumb caveman, they'd eventually start downvoting anyone who talked about X, regardless of its merits.

If individuals were willing or able to do everything social security does, as efficiently and reliably as it does, we wouldn't have needed to create social security in the first place. When we left it to private charity, people who couldn't work lived shorter, more miserable lives. Maybe human nature has changed in the last 80 years, but I wouldn't gamble millions of lives on it.

OK. Social security is theft. Theft, then, created and maintains the greatest anti-poverty program in American history, preventing millions of early deaths, supporting people with disabilities who can't fully provide for themselves, and keeping poor widows and their young children from dying in gutters. So, theft is sometimes good - even theft on a world-historical scale. Great argument.

"Inflation of the Bolivar was under 10% for over 90% of its lifespan..." Pretty easy to minimize disaster if you don't care about honesty.


I'm sure a lot of people who bought at $5k+ would disagree with you about the meaning of crashes.

You'll regret this when inflation reaches 2000% next week because the Fed prints money out of thin air.

So, it's not about getting rich. It's about helping people who are already rich maintain their wealth. That's so much more attractive.

I'm saying common Venezuelans had no savings to lose. Rich Venezuelans had plenty to lose. You can continue to pretend that's an outrageous statement if you want to.
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:28:52
How much savings did the common folk in Venezuela have? How common is 1,000,000% inflation globally?
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:00:07
I think you're just flattering yourself. If you have good reasons for thinking this chart is worth a shit; thinking this chart applies to Bitcoin; thinking you've correctly identified the current "phase" we're in, then share them. Make the case for your pov then maybe someone will think it's worthwhile to argue with you. Otherwise this just seems like a flimsy excuse for you to call yourself "smart money."

That wasn't the question. Venezuela was flush with oil money and inequality. "Common folk" Venezuelans had little or no savings to lose.


It's not common but it happens often. The need for inflation-proof currency sounds truly urgent.

Lower class people don't have wealth that needs maintaining. They have debt. Middle class wealth is typically tied up in housing - if they have positive wealth at all after considering the debt the carry.
"Whatever amount it may be." Your $2 billion, my -$48000, same difference. Both need protecting.
