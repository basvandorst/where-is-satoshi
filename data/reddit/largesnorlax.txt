To think, people could've avoided worrying about this with a simple $300 purchase a couple months ago.
If people are genuinely worried about "pump and dumps", cryptocurrency has the perfect solution: you're able to profit off this!
I don't see the sense in holding onto some sort of insane moral high ground, you're in the wild west. Half of my bitcoin stack came from bitcoin cash.

You're comfortable with believing something unrealistic because it suits your narrative, you mean?
What possible logic are you applying to this? Do you really think that the Ethereum Network that is currently handling the massive amount of transactions in Cryptocurrency, Ripple with its huge bank ties, all the alts with their alternate transaction lanes, the promising new DAG coins, the XMRs, the privacy spinoffs, are going to be worth **5% of the market value**?
I like Bitcoin, but come on.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:28:00
Do you not see it as just a little ironic to be telling someone who has actually mined bitcoin to "educate himself"?
The mining difficulty is slated to be 2.15t in a week. It isn't decreasing.
If mining difficulty is decreasing, something is generally wrong, because that means people are not mining bitcoin, and as a result transactions are being confirmed even less.

.... What are you even talking about?
Why would I do other user's research? 
This is the worst argument I've ever heard. 
The reason *people invest into the idea of Bitcoin is because they want to be able to use Bitcoin*.  If people want to use something that is slow and has large transaction fees, they already have banks. Banks also protect you in case you fuck up your money.
Here's a scenario:
- I want to buy Cryptocurrencies. Which Crypto do I use?
You have 4 choices.
BTC, ETH, LTC, or BCH.
Which do you choose, and why?
BTC is the "dominant trading pair", but is not only the slowest, but has the largest fees.
ETH is accepted on almost all exchanges, and is fast with low fees.
LTC is accepted on less exchanges, and is fast with low fees.
BCH is accepted on very few exchanges, and is fast with low fees.
You must explain why anyone would use Bitcoin to trade Cryptos with. For that matter, you must also explain why people would use Bitcoin to transact anything with. Why would people use Bitcoin to buy a Steam game? Why would people use it to do anything other than slam it into a Trezor and hope it grows, like some sort of mold?
Do you see my point? People ask why other alts are increasing? Well, here you go. Alts actually function.

Yes, this is the prevailing attitude now, the answer is always the same wrong, false answer:
"Just use altcoins if you want to do transactions"
That is the stupidest mentality I can think of, being forced to use altcoins for my *digital currency* because it *cannot handle the purpose for which it was made*.
I am hyped for LN but it is always soon, soon, soon.
How long until a prelim deploy date? Even a taste or a bite of the roadmap? People will slaver over literally anything but are given nothing but "just wait, something will happen eventually".
We are in the tech world where hype and tech is created and affects systems overnight - its good to have a solution on the horizon but people need to be able to know when its coming as well. Doesn't have to be a perfect date but "soon" hasn't been enough for a long while, and market prices show this clearly.

Mempool is simply Bitcoin unconfirmed transactions, as linked above.
Miners prioritise higher fees included in blocks, especially in times of network congestion.
Understandably, people want to use their digital currency, so they pay through the nose to push it through.
Fees rise as more transactions continue to be unconfirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:45:55
Maybe not the right time to be talking about Bitcoin Market dominance, not exactly a reassuring tweet right here.
It's at under 47%, lowest it has ever been. Talking about it being at 95% in the future is signalling not knowing anything whatsoever about the market.
For reference, 95% market dominance in the market right now would mean Bitcoin "should be" $35,791.
Since the tech of alts is going to absolutely explode in 2018 (at least 5x, that's a very conservative number, considering market cap has doubled in the last month, and has gone up [almost 20 times in the last year]( ), that would mean he thinks Bitcoin should be at least $87,500.
Does that sound realistic to anyone, without a working lightning network and other tech exploding?
I'm bullish on Bitcoin and would understand a rise to maybe $40-$50k this year if LN gets implemented - But c'mon. Realistic standards here.

**Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed**
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:23:19
Is it really "FUD" if the transaction problems and fees are **actually there**? 
FUD is generally news created out of nothing to promote fear. That's not what this is.
I own BTC - Quite a bit of it - Do you think I want to use ETH instead of BTC to transfer things? Do you think I want $30-$120 transactions? Hell no.
I want a working LN and I want it sooner than later.
Hopefully these kind of things turn up the "Will it be fixed? Yes" posts into something we can actually use soon.

Mmm. Semi agree, semi not.
Not all gambling is 100% luck. Good poker players can read hands signs and expressions just like a good investor can read charts, market pressure and signals in the space.
Bitcoin is a high risk investment. It is not guaranteed income, it is doing well but it can drop and it can be worth less. This classifies it perfectly as high risk.
That being said, it is on a relatively steady trajectory with fairly decent support levels. It should appreciate.
That doesn't mean holding a million bucks in bitcoin isnt gambling - it is, just like holding a chip lead in poker, you could cash out at any time or lose at any time, you just choose not to because there is more to be made.

Sure, next time I'll just stockpile some ETH  instead of using my currency (ironic, yes?), but I needed in on an opportunity within an hour. That's the fees, segwit is the exception, not the rule.

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:09:59
Yes, alts increase when bitcoins price is stable, and decrease when bitcoin is rising or falling, that'd how it works.
If you're wondering why btc isn't increasing, again, look at the mempool. Look at the usability of btc. Look at the fees.
Now look at its direct competitors and how they handle those things. Look at ETH's price trend, or xrp, or ltc, or bch.
You will see the problem very quickly if you're opening your eyes to it. Alts are doing Bitcoins job better than it is right now.

ETH in particular though is going to be a big winner in 2018 - Maybe if you want to spend 2k euro, I would put it into ETH, it will ride out any of BTC's storms as it has its own dedicated, functional network.

@_date: 2017-12-22 13:17:08
Very likely. Mining difficulty increases every two weeks (making mining harder, hence less transactions go through) and each time difficulty increases, the mempool grows larger, increasing fees.
This is one of the reasons bitcoins price isn't doing so hot at the moment - the network has grown faster than it scaled.

Keeping money on an exchange is liking leaving thousands of dollars in cash at an acquaintance's house - You wouldn't do that, right? 
A wallet allows you to have your private keys in your control at all times. If you do not have your private keys (Aka: Your coins are on an exchange) you do not own your coins. The exchange owns your coins. They could disappear or claim them at any time, and you would be SOL.

Well, exchanges aren't exactly Bitcoin, just like Tether isn't Bitcoin - That's what I was trying to get across. 
This is part of the reason we need to get people knowledgeable on security and hardware wallets as a very basic first step in investing. So many people are just leaving their funds on an exchange, where they can't withdraw them and they don't even have their own private keys.
Like all new things, there are going to be some defunct actors - Just like banks in the days closed their doors and ruined people's lives, I'm sure Exchanges will have their craziness as well. 
If/when it happens, people will be far more aware that they need to take measures to be their own bank, and not having an exchange do their work for them.

At some point, you have to be able to use critical thinking and understand there are people here who love bitcoin and want it to succeed that are being critical of it because it currently sucks at what it was designed to do.
Just because someone does not enjoy using a system that is currently floundering does not mean they are "spreading fud" or "shilling" or that they should "just go away" or "should stop using Bitcoin".
People get invested into a product because they enjoy it and want it to succeed.
If your favourite sports team makes bad trading or coaching decisions for years and every year your team goes 21-60, the sports fans are not "shills" and "fund spreaders" when they talk about this.
Likewise on r/bitcoin. People who talk about problems are people who want to use bitcoin and can't without great difficulty that gets worse daily should not be insulted.

@_date: 2017-12-20 14:18:44


I trade Cryptocurrencies. Am I supposed to want long and expensive? How does that make any sense?
If I am not supposed to use my BTC as a dominant trading pair, why are the value of alts tied to Bitcoin? Why not ETH, LTC or BCH? I can actually transact with them.
Using paypal as an argument is nonsensical since obviously exchanges don't accept paypal, so I won't devote any more keystrokes to that.
Listen - I like the *future* of Bitcoin. I don't like the **present** of Bitcoin, where I can't use it. 
Look at that guy, trying to transfer 0.1 btc and getting it stuck with a **$42 fucking fee**. On Saturday, that could've been me, if I didn't **ram in $120 in fees** for a time-sensitive trade.
All talk about "growing stronger aside adoption" and "waiting for solutions" is all fine if you buy your bitcoin and keep it in a vault, waiting for it to come out of its cocoon so it can become a wonderful butterfly, but that doesn't help use cases. These are the people suffering right now.
[These are the people caught in the 225k mempool]( sending transactions of $30+ that don't go through.
These are the people getting caught trying to use the tech they bought into, but instead only get disappointed.
These are the people you need to convince, not me.

"If bitcoin is too expensive for you to use, don't use it any more."
What a shitty, ridiculous and boneheaded way of thinking.
The fact that a person took the time to type this on the internet actually hurts me inside.

To me, all forks are bitcoin, even the shitty scam coins like btg
They're a part of bitcoin history.
Even if you were only interested in profit it doesn't make sense to sell, that $300 coin in august is worth 4k now and will keep rising. Even bitcoin gold is at a high price.
If you really needed cash or something you could sell it, but then you lose all rights to complain about the price after.
Bitcoin is meant to be forked,  I simply think selling the forks of something valuable like btc Is wasteful.

@_date: 2017-12-21 22:10:42
Why would anyone, including me, use Bitcoin as a method of exchange if it is inefficient, ineffective, and more expensive than any other method of exchange?
That's my underlying point here. I don't care if you want to doublespeak. Why would people use Bitcoin right now?
Why would people transfer $100? $200? $300? None of these make sense with a $50 fee.
It starts to make sense around $1000. But at this level, you may as well use a bank, since ironically, it is cheaper and safer to do so. I do this all the time and before Bitcoin it would cost me $40 or so to send $1000 to my Australian account.
This leads me back to the same original question, which again remains unanswered:
*Is a currency you cannot use as a currency because the fees are too high to use it fundamentally broken?*
A yes or no on this point would be appreciated.
Saying "don't use it until sidechains exist" is just a hedge that makes no sense. Is Bitcoin functional for the average person, or do I need to be full of disposable income to even consider using it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:04:25
I'm saying you can simply use another currency (via money, banks, any other crypto) to transact. In this case, why do anything with bitcoin other than what I said, throw it in a wallet and forget about it?
Why am I buying stacks of ETH to trade with instead of using my btc?
Why is ltc a better medium to transact with than my btc?
Do you not see this as a problem, that my digital currency is too expensive to be used as a currency, and your solution is to stop using it as a currency?

Bingo, that's my problem.
Same issue I have with XRB, except XRB has a working platform and XBY doesn't. The price definitely reflects that.
Most of the picks on this list are strong, I have a couple picks that people might like that might improve soon:
 - I hyped it last week at $0.07, super undervalued at the moment.
 - I keep hearing good things about it, it's early and it has very limited supply. Would probably give it a swing.
 - I hyped this at $0.50, I'll hype it at $1.50. You don't get much better value here. Already working with real world applications.
 - I'm sure people are tired of hearing about Raiblocks (or maybe you don't visit and aren't yet) but I can't stress how useful this coin actually is. The product works, perfectly, and does its one thing well.  It's limited to 2 bogus exchanges and that's suffocating the price. When it was $0.50 I was saying it would get to $5 overnight if it got onto a decent exchange, turns out it'll probably get there even on the two crappy ones it's on already. 
Good starts?
Honestly, you can go by most of the list up there and it's still good buys.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:32:47
ETH's great, but I mean, I have Bitcoin. Why can't I use Bitcoin? That's what I bought it for, right? To use?
Are transaction hikes and the mempool going to be clearing soon, or getting worse? I see a (+18.01%) 2.21 T retarget in 2 weeks again - That doesn't seem like that kind of thing will go away, especially since it's been continuing for a while now.

When bitcoin drops, other Cryptos drop, they are all paired with bitcoin.
This is what has always happened, so what you're saying doesn't mean anything. When bitcoin goes down all alts drop.
There are a couple which are semi detached like XRB and iota (which is where you probably want to have your money anyways) but when btc is down you'll always see the red sea. Its not like all Cryptos magically get sold when they see btc dropping, they are connected via btc trading pairs.

That doctor is on vacation in the swiss alps. Maybe the patient will live by the time he gets back, maybe the patient will die. But he will bleed and he will get worse.
How big does the mempool need to get before people realize its a problem that can't be fixed by getting an echo chamber to adopt a poor solution? 300k? 400k?
How high does the average transaction fee need to get? $30? $40? Its at $42 right now. 
How high does the difficulty need to be before people realize there's an issue? It goes up 18% every two weeks. Its meant to. 2t? 3t?
4 difficulty adjustments (2 months) from now, if usage continues at this rate, the mempool will be 600k+. Transactions will be $100. They were $5 earlier this month.
When do people realize a tiny adoption of a bandaid cannot fix something like that?

Its not really the miners fault to be fair. This goes back to the old block size argument.  The number of miners could double and we would still run into the same issue.

On mobile on a train, so I can't really link articles, but dag coins are low fee and minerless. Xrb would be the no fee currency, iota will be integrates into iot, which will be big in the next couple years.
Xrb has been held back by the crap exchanges it's been on, while iota has had a terrible wallet and a centralized node its depended on while the network grows that will be removed later on
Xrbs potential for the new year is immense. I'd say potential for 100x if it gets on a real exchange, no word of a lie. Their dev team is tiny and sucks at advertising such a great project.
Iota is more conservative. I'd say a possible 10-15x rise at max, assuming they fix their wallet issues and get the network pumping.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:04:43
Much like banks far far back in the day, and stock markets later on, unfortunately people will have to learn about security the hard way.
Cryptocurrency is one of those things where you can't sugar coat security. Leaving thousands of dollars around on an exchange is like leaving thousands of dollars at a friend-of-a-friend's house. It's not even at a close friend's, you're just leaving thousands laying around, and trusting that they won't steal it, or someone won't visit and take it, or any number of things to happen to it.
Is this noob unfriendly while seeking widespread awareness? Sure. But in a way it has to be. It's far better to have your first mistake being losing $20 on coinbase rather than thousands of dollars on Bitfinex.

Your voice has the same impact as my granddad talking about bitcoin, an asset he has no understanding of with a concept he doesn't grasp.
Sure, it can go down and crash. It'll get bought back up and somewhere in the middle we'll have another price. That's the nature of investing. It's fine if you're not OK with the risk, not everyone is.

Yeah, tell that to people who actually transact with bitcoin.
Segwit isn't implemented in 9/10 addresses including most exchanges. The mempool is at 200k.  Moving bitcoin is a nightmare and you almost have to change it into ltc, ETH or bch first. Even doing that, you suck up outlandish fees or it doesn't move.
If I didn't shell out $120 last night I wouldve missed a trading opportunity of thousands because it wouldve been stuck for half a day. Does that sound like its in a good place? I could've used any other crypto for that. That's *with* converting it to ETH.

Neither solution is perfect, both are exciting new techs.
Both iota and raiblocks have exciting new dag tech in the works. The ETH net is booming. Neo is taking off, qtum is making major moves.
These are still early days. If Bitcoin can't fight off a tech that simply changed its block size, its not as resilient as it needs to be to take over as a universal currency anyways.
Hope this gives devs the kick in the butt they need to get LN deployed. I could use a good Old fashioned price war.

I do the same, the evidence is in Bitcoin market dominance.
If you've been tracking the market, you'll notice it is down to a level unseen since ETH existed and was challenging back in June. Its tracking to go below 40% today.
That means very specifically that all of crypto isn't lagging, its only bitcoin and for very obvious reasons. Transaction fees, transaction time and mempool bloat.
Let's be fair here, the people who are selling crypto for Christmas gifts (why would anyone sell their deflationary currency for a couple hundred in gifts anyways?) Aren't making market moves of billions, nor do they influence price factors.
Simply put, the market is losing confidence in btc and pouring money into alts.
ETH is not down 20%. Dash is not down 20%. Bch is not down 20%. All of these are riding all time highs while btc stagnates.
If you've been tracking (as I do very closely every day, if you've ever stopped by r/cryptocurrency you'll see a couple posts of mine,) this is not a trend from the last couple bch days.
As the mempool goes up, as people get frustrated and fees cost more, this will cost bitcoin (and specifically bitcoin, not cryptocurrency, though they suffer a little via trading pairs) market share and dominance to alts that function doing their intended purpose.
Hopefully that was a good read.

[Charts look a bit different to me in this respect](
Looks like ETH at $0.90/transaction did 1,056,805 transactions totaling 9.1b, or $1,174,227.
Looks like BTC did $28/transaction, did 396,049 transactions totaling 31.9b, or $11,089,372.
1/3 of the transactions, triple the money at 10x the cost. Looks like ETH smashes it into dust in every respect.

There's nothing to say, really.
They decided long ago that small blocks were the way to go forward. You wait for lightning network and you like it, there is no other choice.
This is a good time to diversify into alts that have value and function.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:54:20
Why would you hate that you're "giving into" anything?
Cryptocurrency is not a cult. You are not obligated to hold 100% Bitcoin at all times. If a crypto is functional and you want to use it, go ahead and buy it.
There is a reason Bitcoin's market dominance has fallen to 43%. As the OP said, until Lightning Network deployment, Bitcoin's assets will bleed into alts that actually function properly, efficiently, and quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:55:15
So, just to be clear: 
No one should use Bitcoin *at all* until Lightning Network releases?
Right now transaction fees are edging up towards $50. I wouldn't use that for anything less than $1000 if it were any other service. (5% fees is ludicrous, but possibly acceptable if urgent).
How about in a month, when it edges towards $100? 
Two months, where it's above that?
Do I only send BTC to send thousands around? What about its intended purpose, or if people want to buy small amounts?
Not everyone has the cash I have available to spend on Crypto - So they just can't buy it, or use it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:03:21
I didn't mention Bitcoin Cash.
"Yet" doesn't mean anyone to people who want to use Bitcoin. And I'm not talking about coffee money.
I'm talking Cryptocurrency being used as Cryptocurrency.
I did a trade on Sunday that I had to pay $120 for because it was a multipart transaction. Ironically, fees were "cheap" then - I would've paid $200+ now.
BTC is no longer functional as a currency. Repeating that LN is coming over and over again like some sort of mantra is not effective for people who want to use BTC as what it was designed for.
I have a stack of ETH now that I'll use for the original purpose Bitcoin was created for, my BTC will sit in my trezor until it's usable.
Unfortunately, people don't see this as a problem, and chant "HODL" like some sort of brainwashed cult.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:41:48
Whether you want to sell or not is up to you. Personally, I don't think it is worth paying $200 to sell my btc, but it may be worth it to you.
The last transaction I did was $120 and took 3 hours, that was on the weekend. Its likely yours will be in the $50-100 range if you're transferring less (I sent 1 btc, most don't transact volumes that large) and should take 5-6 hours at current rates and traffic.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:56
Uh, my BCH is going up, is that good news?
Probably not.
In all seriousness though, this is part of the problem with Bitcoin right now - The mempool problem is not going to go away.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:15:25
Not a bad mix, but I'd suggest holding btc in tune with its current market dominance, and bch 1:1 with btc.
Tune btc percentage down a bit, bch up a bit. ETH up a bit, ltc down a bit. Up eos to iota and add xrb, and you've got a winning portfolio for 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:12:11
For the people who have their coins sitting on an exchange, the answer is *always* control your own keys.
Buy a [ledger]( or a [Trezor]( and you can not only get your forked coins whenever you want, but you can move them whenever you'd like.
Personally, I wouldn't sell any Bitcoin forks, but that's up to you.
Keeping your coins on an exchange is just like keeping your money in a bank, you're trusting other people with your money instead of keeping it safe.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:51
Uh.. comparing Bitcoin to DSL is not the kindest compliment you could give it.
I mean, *I'M* not worried, like I've said many other places, I hold BTC and its forks 1:1, always have and always will - But a lot of newcomers will be, and they want their investment to be worthwhile.
How do you think the guy who bought in at $19,000 feels when he can't transfer BTC without a $50 fee? 
I don't think he'll buy the Grandma Su argument with the DSL, personally.

I mean, you don't really want less miners, that would make the problem even worse.
Right now the mempool is basically bursting at the seams with all miners going full power. Take away 50% of the miners and difficulty might adjust in two weeks, but in the meantime you'd get a 400k transaction mempool, which would be horrible for bitcoin.

I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm not saying people who can't afford transaction fees should try anyways.

Better fix than a bandaid, that's for sure.
Biggest issues are mempool, transaction fees and speed of the network. 
Lightning channels being expensive is irrelevant once the average fee climbs over $50, which is where it will reach today. Literally any solution is better.

I mean, bitcoin is at the same price it was three days ago. You haven't seen a drop, this price is up like $10000 in December.
However, a lot of value is funneling into alts right now because they are actually usable as a currency (ripple, ETH, ltc, bch) or because they have promising prospects.
You'll notice if you look at coinmarketcap.com that bitcoin market dominance is below 50%, lowest its been for a while. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:57:20

ETH will be a big mover in 2018, even bigger than it is now.

First off, I *literally* sent 1 BTC yesterday, the recommended fee from my Trezor was $120 on high. The **best** fees are [0.00538 BTC/KvB]( right now.
There is no such thing as "sending bitcoins free", nor would you able able to move something as large as 1 BTC for a minimal fee with a 200k mempool.

I would keep your ETH, honestly. I'm going to pick some more up myself.
ETH is always going to be usable and always will appreciate in value. There are so many ETH tokens with so many cool applications and they all run on the Ethereum network.
I'd hold the BTC you have, keep the ETH.

Yeah, I was wondering why this twit came in and started attacking me in the other thread, turns out this is why.
There are legitimate concerns with bitcoin and its current molasses performance - dismissing fellow people who *want to use it for its intended purpose* as shills or trolls is just sheer ignorance.
Guess what, if you believe in something you want it to be the best it can be. Criticism is healthy, especially when market prices are directly reflecting alts that currently do Bitcoins job better than bitcoin does.
I'm sick and tired of people deflecting and pretending nothing is wrong when people post about valid concerns - We all want a healthy bitcoin that does its job well.

People *should* be pissed about the current state of affairs. It doesn't affect me as much as others, small investors trying to get into crypto for the first time.
I have plenty of cash and although I'll be pissed about exorbitant costs, it's currently the cost of doing Bitcoin business.
Although let's be honest, no one should treat this as normal. If PayPal or your bank gave you a $120 fee to move money around you'd tell them to eat a fat dick.
The real guy getting fucked here is the noob who signs up on coinbase, buys $50 worth of bitcoin and tries to transfer it to a wallet, but gets charged $30 for the privilege of waiting two days to receive it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:52:50
Long haul, it has potential. Short term, it will be glacial for a while.
Depends how safe you want your portfolio to be - I always said the theoretical cap for IOTA (with the most extreme hype, a functioning wallet and user understanding) would be about $10 short term, and $5 is without any of that, which is about where it is right now.
You're looking at at least half a year until IOTA appreciates over the $10 mark (I think, could be slower or faster, if it ever does.)
Disclaimer - I sold my IOTA at $5 for EOS, which I sold at $12 for XRB and Monero.
Up to you. I think it has a portfolio slot in a very long term holding portfolio. It won't explode, but it won't depreciate either.

He's not quite right here, though his concept is correct.
Bitcoin's difficulty in a week will be 2.2T
An Antminer s9 running 24/7 would earn 815.8$/month in BTC - $110 electricity, or $700/month
Initial investment (assuming you can't get it from Bitmain, which no one can) is roughly $3.5k USD on ebay, or 6 month ROI assuming you're selling your BTC (Which you'd be silly to do)
If you put $3.5k into Bitcoin 6 months ago, you would've invested in June at $2700, and would've received 1.296 btc which would be valued at $22685.18 today
If you had mined coins for 6 months, you would have received 0.08 (ish) x6 btc, or 0.48 btc, resulting in $8400
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:29

I paid $120 to move BTC last night, *even with converting some to ETH*. Totally unusable. I think I'll have to keep a store of ETH to actually do trades with instead of BTC and just seal it up on my Trezor for good.

What else would I transact with? Bitcoin isn't accepted anywhere, and if it was, I still wouldn't use it because of the fees and transaction times.  
If I was going to use crypto in the real world, Bitcoin is **still** the worst use case because the same problems apply in real world.
There seems to be plenty to convince, given the market sentiment. There's a reason dominance has fallen 20% over the last couple weeks and BCH is at $4k currently.
Just because you don't acknowledge the problem doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but I'm off to shower and have a jog - Cheers.

Or, yaknow, people think a service you can actually transact with has value.
I moved around about 1 btc for alts and whatnot last night. Even converting it to ETH (something I shouldn't have to do with a good system by the way) I still paid over $100 in fees.

BTC	36.3%  - Good, maybe a little low.
XRB	14.9% - Strong. It will explode likely sooner than later.
IOT	8.8% - Hold this long term and its fine.
REQ	8.1% - Also a good long term hold.
BCH	6.6% - Same here. Solid portfolio so far.
VEN	6.3% - Your picks are on point.
ETH	5.7%  - Again, can't go wrong with ETH.
NEO	2.9% - This will keep appreciating as well.
XLM	2.7% - I swear, Lumens is going to take off soon, its been hovering for so long at a price breakout.
LTC	1.3% - Not much, so no big deal. It'll appreciate over time.
XBY	1.2% - Not a fan - Swap this for [Verge](
SUB	0.8% - A solid side option, it'll be ok.
XRP	0.8% - Again, a small amount so no big deal. Will appreciate.
OMG	0.6%  - Good project, should be fine.
WTC	0.6% - I'm not the biggest fan of Walton but its 0.6% - Big deal.
LINK	0.5% - Underrated side project.
DASH	0.5% - I'm not a dash fan, but you can't deny its value long term.
WABI	0.4% - I haven't done much research on WABI but it seems solid. Probably good to hold.
POWR	0.3% - Long, LONG term hold, but should appreciate short term as well.
ARK	0.3% - I know everyone hypes up ARK, but I think I would turn this into DRGN.
DRGN	0.2% - Honestly undervalued.
Would rate your portfolio a solid A. Lots of my picks in there. If you consolidated ARK, XBY and POWR into other coins, you might have better success, but I don't think you need to sell any really.

Hey, I've been saying it, but people don't want to listen. They'd rather mash downvote and insult people who have issues.
Market Dominance has been dropping for weeks.  People have been blaming everything possible - Roger Ver, Jihan, Coinbase, Christmas, people "taking profits", but they never blame the system itself or question it. People who dissent are slathered with "FUD", or "Shills", or "drama queens" (Like is already happening in this thread).
People who don't want to pay $50 transaction fees are told to "not use Bitcoin until it's better".
People who want to transact with Bitcoin are told to "Use altcoins instead of Bitcoin".
People who grumble about paying $40 for a $100 transfer are called "Roger Ver Shills".
Alts are performing amazingly. Bitcoin is not. This should not come as a surprise to anyone.

However, r/bitcoin has this nasty habit of flaming people simply because bitcoin isn't going up 10% a day, so anyone who mentions anything negative is constantly attacked because people are *real mad about their losses and need someone to blame*.
Just remember that the vast majority of people who get into bitcoin are new and they are encountering real problems for the first time.
Fees have risen from a semi manageable $5 to $55 this month alone. Mining difficulty is off the charts. The problems are there, and yelling at people who recognize them and telling them to go away won't really help things.

Yet you see all the nodding parrots with the HODL memes about how its a long term buy and there should be no worries ever for any reason, people are silly.
If people did the smallest amount of research into time trends they'd see this is super normal.
I dunno, if you truly believe in holding long term, you shouldn't give two shits about tiny bumps in the road like this. Bitcoin literally went up 14% today and people are crying about a tiny correction of $400.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:14:18
So, everyone on here regurgitates the hodl meme, which is *supposed* to mean that you hold through the good and bad times in order to profit in the long term...
But every time bitcoin goes down, you can see no one actually practices what they preach, since everything starts getting called an attack, witch hunts start and the mud gets slung around.
If you actually believe something like bch is about to get 'pumped', a smart investor would invest. Buy low and sell high, that's how trading works.
That's what I did last weekend. I turned $2200 or so into $4200 for the bitcoin stash. I still own some bch, which is still profitable.
The real answer is people are just afraid and hodl is just a meme, not a real philosophy. People panic at the thought of change and can't maintain that bitcoin is a long term hold, so they freak out and attack every time the price changes slightly to the negative.

I was going to say, if you actually believe BTC is a viable store of value, you buy whenever you have money and wait for it to appreciate.
I dunno why people panic so much unless they're day trading. If it goes up, neat. If it goes down, buy some more.
Unless of course you don't believe in it, but I don't know why you'd be in the game in the first place if that was the case.

Corporations value protection, safety and reliability. Windows xp has proven time and again to be extremely reliable.
Windows xp also is fairly easy to understand for old people getting into computers. The office suite might seem like an ancient relic to us, but to a lot of 50+  people transitioning into computer use, Microsoft outlook, word and PowerPoint are at the very height of their technical knowledge.
Giving them a windows 10 machine would fuck everything up. Security wise it would be a disaster. Technology wise it would be too confusing.
There is value in using xp. Its not for you, the cryptocurrency using, fiat hating computer whiz. Its for corporations who want a stable, secure os  that they can integrate their employees into that everyone in the corporation can understand at a basic level, not just the 2 it guys.

Use the reddit search bar for your question.
Don't delete your transaction. It will confirm, you set the fee far too low, but it will confirm when the mempool is low. Don't expect it to clear this weekend, it will be congested for a while.
This is a good lesson on mempool use - [Check this chart in the future]( and when the mempool is large, you must send with higher fees, or risk this problem.

Let me break it down for you as a user of both subs:
**- Stale memes
- New users asking about getting into the market
- TO THE MOON parroting
- We hate Roger Ver/Jihan/Fuck altcoins!
- Rollercoaster gifs
- Largely clueless people
**- Jaded people who have been banned from - Promotion / adoption of Bitcoin Cash
- More knowledgeable (overall) community, but more conspiracy prone
- Bitter messages hoping for the fall of BTC and push of BCH
- Meta talk about and - Largely angry users hoping for the investments of others to fall so they can profit
Both communities have their problems and both have their upsides. If you look closely, you can see the issues with both.
I think both can co-exist if they just look at "Bitcoin" as Bitcoin + Bitcoin cash, as a whole. The entire ledger is value, whether each side wants to push their personal horse forward.
Just my 2 cents though.

To a certain point. Not to the point of 100k+ bitcoins.
Don't put the horse blinders on yourself as well - Bitcoin is a niche thing that needs adoption. You cannot adopt without the average joe adopting it. 
Repeating the market cap of gold isn't going to change the fact Bitcoin needs to be usable, understandable, and functional for the average person wanting to use it for cigarettes, for a dinner out, for the merchant accepting it, and for everyone involved.
Gold is a commodity that people have known about for thousands of years - No shit its market cap is high. Bitcoin is something for tech geeks made up in the last decade that no one knows about yet, despite everyone's parroting here.
It's on the verge of pushing mainstream - Don't kneecap it by saying it doesn't need to be a fucking currency, it *does* need to be a currency. It *is* a currency. It was **designed to be a currency**. It just needs to be better.

@_date: 2017-11-16 01:28:27
Yes, so how likely do you think bitcoin is going to fluctuate 10% a day? Do you look at price charts?
Look at a smaller altcoin and see where you can make money trading on volatility. 
Bitcoin is not as unstable in terms of overall percentage as you think. It may go up $100-200 in the span of most days, but that's barely 2-4%.
Take a close comparison in bch. It fluctuates $100-$150 a day, but that's 10% worth. Smaller coins do even more.

Same reason people would buy Bitcoin when it's falling?
People literally say "Buy the dip" all the time.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:36:23
In general the philosophy is the same, wait for a dip, ensure it isn't bottoming out, then buy. Put in a sell order at a higher price and move on.
Ideally you want to trade a coin that is known so it has some sort of volume, but one that is volatile. Its kind of like trading penny stock at the stock market. You have to analyze trends and when people buy and sell.
For instance, the Chinese investors love trading bitcoin cash on bithumb, so cash sometimes trends down $150 during us time and up $200 during Chinese trading hours.
Up to you on what trends you use but as much as people joke about it, bitcoin price is too high to really be volatile percentage wise these days.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:23:19
Personally, cut out the middleman that is phone or software wallets and buy yourself a cold wallet.

@_date: 2017-11-13 21:27:39
Hey, finally someone with some common sense!
This is what I was talking about as well, some people actually want to use bitcoin for its intended purpose, which is currency. Currently, ETH and bch are the best options for this purpose. Bitcoin will jump as soon as it fixes this issue, which is people wanting to use it for their daily lives. Ordering a part online, grabbing dinner at a restaurant, that kind of thing.
I hate the coffee example because its super inaccurate. There are plenty of things you can use to buy a dollar worth of coffee. Where btc misses out its in mid range purchases, which is the massive bulk of transactions, the $20-$1000 range. It comes out fine in large transactions, and probably shouldn't compete in the coffee and donut market.
I think there is plenty of room for multiple coins filling different market niches, but bitcoin could go huge by filling the midrange market in the future.

I think people forget that Redditors are human beings, and Reddit users are not the people making huge market swings.
We are a very minor market worldwide. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:18:03
Ok, to further explain my position I guess, I both care about the long term and the short term - I trade and I hold both coins in a 1:1 value, 1 BTC to 1 BCH.
However, I also trade BCH during these upswings, and put the proceeds into my BTC stash - While this is personal opinion only, I think anyone who does not take advantage of these obvious momentum swings foolish, since they are:
- Relatively easy to time
- Almost guaranteed
- Free money
For people to complain constantly about something that is regularly occurring and profitable is nonsensical to me. If you know it's going to happen and you can make money, why would you not invest in something like that short term?
In 5-10 years, any money I invest now in crypto will be meaningless in the long run. BTC will likely be worth 100k+, or BCH will be worth 100k+, and the minor investments I've made now in either will look like nothing.
Do I think BCH has the best tech currently? Nah, I don't. Do I think it is a functional, tradeable coin? Sure. Does it have value? Definitely.
Dunno - I just think more people should be aware of the ability to move money around and be smart about it. They'd get way more BTC as a result if they did.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:17:26
Well, China loves moving fast, untraceable cash around - BTC *is* kind of not great for that at the moment. They could use ETH, they could use LTC, but a lot of Chinese investors have a stake in BCH doing well, so I'm guessing they use that as their "liquid" currency.
Bitcoin is many things, but one thing it isn't right now is liquid. It's a bulky beast that can move at times, but probably not as fast as it should.
There *is* value in BCH and it does have its supporters. I think the North American market cares more about price than it does about security, so BTC is a better sell - China cares about speed and transaction fees.
Also, just as a heads up, china's trading day is wrapping up and BTC is at nearly $8k on bithumb, so you know what this means...
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:41:53
The mega rich would have to liquidate their capital (not possible) to buy every bitcoin in circulation (also not possible, since there are 8 million to be mined still)
Doing so would create a buying frenzy so immense the price would skyrocket as soon as they started, which would make them unable to afford doing so

500k is what most people would call "extreme bull".
Many things would need to happen:
- Bitcoin would need to be more usable, more attractive, and have less fees than Cash, Credit Cards and all other cryptocurrencies.
- Bitcoin would need to keep its privacy secure and its network stable
- The price would need to grow to 50k+ and stabilize at a level where people would know it is a reliable price
- A major market collapse would have to happen in a major country, with Bitcoin filling in the pieces 
Also, this theoretical scenario is in 5-20 years time with no one knowing the timeline, or the events leading up to it. 
A more likely scenario is the price going crazy around 100k - A worldwide currency used by anyone with a cell phone in theory is worth 2 Googles. 10, probably not, but you never know what the future could hold.
In those 5-20 years, it could also be replaced, subverted, or otherwise crippled. No one really knows.

The gambler in you is already there. You're investing in an unfinished speculative product.
The best position is to invest what you can when you can over a long period of time, the exact same as building up a stock or investment portfolio.
It's nice to think that you can always time dips, but again, like the stock market, you're not always going to pick up on them. Especially when Bitcoin is SUCH high demand right now, they'll last very short times.
Unless you're day trading literally every day (Unlikely, as most people have lives) it's unlikely you'll ever hit this target, so the sure and safe way is to plug away gradually.

As someone who fools around with alts, here's my take:
- LTC - Meh, it'll go up, but not much. It's ok. 6/10.
- VTC - Hard to say. It sat dormant for YEARS and BTC dragged it up into a decent level. 5/10.
- BTC - Could go horribly wrong but is almost certainly stable longterm. 9/10
- NAV - Tiny volume, garbage. Might improve longterm but doubtful. 4/10
- IOTA - This is a really good one, I have this myself. Just made a deal with Microsoft and will skyrocket over next week. 9.5/10

There are only so many miners, so many blocks, and so many transactions. When transactions are more than blocks, mempool rises, there are no attacks involved

Partially agree, partially disagree. 
Any currency that is currently the equivalent of $7000+ USD per unit should be able to be moved in days for a modest fee.
I agree we're not quite at mass adoption, but in order for all the HODL shouting MOON yelling chimpanzees to reach their goal, Bitcoin must scale at a reasonable price point with a reasonable transfer time.

I mean, it's two different situations.
If they invested, and simply failed to sell on the downturn, *that* is their fault. They are responsible for the timing of their trades.
However, that isn't the case here - They invested, and *their exchange actually went down for the duration of the inflation and deflation*. Not a corporate lawyer, but this is something that is exceedingly rare - Exchanges aren't supposed to close or suspend trading, it's generally stated in their terms of use.
In this case, it's hard to blame the investors for "being fooled", since in normal circumstances, they would be entirely able to sell on the downturn. Here, they were denied access to their funds.

You should be happy about this, this means that coins like bch can rise without hitting btc numbers. The less connected the coins are the better.
In theory if you follow the last trends, bch rose $350 or so yesterday and btc should in theory have trended down that amount.
The fact it didn't means good things for both coins.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:40:56
Yep, I've owned both for a long time.
I've always compared Bitcoin to Gold, and Bitcoin Cash to something closer to everyday currency use. Both have their values.
They can co-exist, but the community will always be contentious about which one is the "Real" coin, even though the best thing about Crypto is that you can simply buy whichever coin you want, or own both of them.
So as to the question, they can - But users will probably never be happy about it.

More so that big round numbers are scary for people, which is why it held at $7998 and was sold off constantly for the last couple days.

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:07:58
Mempool empties at a stable rate, aka the rate of miners mining the coin.
Unsuprisingly, in a weekend where 4 or 5 recordbreaking highs are set, the number of bitcoin transactions are huge.
That's just how the mempool works.
Bitcoin yesterday did 400k+ transactions, or about 20-30% more than normal volume. With that, you get cluttered mempool.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:47:19

A lot of people seem to think that koreans are the ones pushing the price, Korea is a small nation, it doesn't move 4 billion in trades a day
All that volume is Chinese, you can check and confirm the chinese trading hours for yourself, but they match up perfectly
Trading crypto on exchanges is not allowed in china currently
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:19:58
Short answer: don't.
Its too expensive to day trade for too little return. Who wants to spend $7000 for a $150 profit?
You could day trade literally any other altcoin instead and achieve the same result for a lower buyin. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:28:06
How's the fees on these things?
If they're still boosted 15%+ there's no way I'd ever use them still when I can simply get it off QuadrigaCX instead.
For instance - 1 btc = 9761.22 CAD at the moment. Quadriga Trading at 9900, or a 1.4% push.
Most of these ATMS would trade at a 10-15% push, making it $10,737-$11,225 which is kind of nonsensical.
What's the current fee rate?
I saved myself time and looked it up - **BTC price: Buy at 10880.11 CAD**, or about 11%.  I get you guys are trying to provide a service, but there's no reason anyone would pay a 11% premium when they could simply log onto an exchange and do the same thing.

Depends whether it can actually be used soon or not.
Right now the network is sluggish and the fees are rather high. If Lightning network takes off and is a success, give it 4-5 years to balloon in value and absorb other altcoins.
If Lightning network has security concerns or boondoggles attached to it, 5-10 years.
Right now it's a fantastic idea - But it has to both compete with and beat the current methods of payment and merchant usage that exists in the market so your average joe can just pick up his phone and use it without a single hassle.  It isn't quite there yet.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:07:51
Shrug, people can refer to anything they want - People refer to Bitcoin as a shitcoin too. Doesn't mean they are correct.
Regardless, it makes very little sense to be proud of selling something that is immensely profitable while it is on the upswing, but if that is what makes people happy, by all means do it. :)

Hey, I've owned both.
Nicehash (1070s) Mining rigs are fairly quiet, but don't have as much power. You'll get about half as much money as you'd get out of an antminer s9, for less electricity. If you have no idea what you're doing setting it up, it's going to suck. Lots of tweaking to do and not for your average noob. You can put it pretty much anywhere, as long as you have proper cooling for it.
S9 is loud as fuck, it's an industrial machine. You need proper electrical setup and a quiet, quiet place for it. It's very efficient and is the best earner, but is aging and will have competition next year at the very latest. You also can't buy them off bitmain's site because it sucks nads, so even purchasing one is like winning the lottery. Sometimes you win, most times you lose.
A mining rig you can point to other things once one coin becomes unprofitable. Once the s9 is obsolete its a hunk of trash.
Each has their pros and cons.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:52:38
Difficulty changes can change BTC in multiple ways.
If the difficulty trends upwards, another coin can be more popular to mine.  If this is the case, sometimes the value of another coin can go up, and BTC's may trend downwards. When not as many miners are on the BTC network, the [Bitcoin mempool]( can get larger, resulting in higher transaction fees.
Easier difficulties trend towards smooth sailing in the mempool and in general, prices raising.
In general, the difficulty trends upwards, as BTC is incredibly popular to mine  - Check that difficulty graph I sent, you'll see it generally heads up, except for the last little block where there was some disruption with miners heading off the network.
Harder difficulty makes Blocks (what miners live for) come less often, but often with fuller blocks, which means the fees are increased because the mempool is larger.
Hopefully that helps!

This is the standard new reddit shitposting account parroting what he's hearing.
The miners mining for their profit is *"an attack"*  People buying something other than bitcoin is also "an attack". 
There is nothing else more profitable than Bitcoin. Ever. No exceptions. There are no other cryptocurrencies. Only Bitcoin exists. It is only ever allowed to be bought. 
That's how this silliness sounds. 
People with no ASIC equipment who contribute nothing to Bitcoin mining complain when people who actually contribute to the mining pools that process blocks and [keep the mempool from looking like this]( get angry at the miners when **another chain makes them more money**. Think about that.
That's like getting mad at a part time jobber who goes to mow a lawn where the guy pays him $40 instead of $20, and saying he's ruining the economy, that all lawn mowers should only ever get paid $20, because fuck you, you didn't mow my lawn, and the grass is growing like crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:54:43
If there is demand (people buying), price goes up (Because the supply is lower), just like every other market.
Say Bill gates was to want to buy 1 million bitcoins. They're $9200, let's just say.
He goes onto GDAX and buys all the Bitcoins there up to a certain price point, all priced between $9000-$12000. The price of Bitcoins on Gdax is now $12k.
He does the same on Bittrex. The price is Bitcoins is now $12k.
He goes from exchange to exchange, buying up Bitcoins. He is singlehandedly raising the price of Bitcoins.
Let's say he manages to clean every exchange out of their supply of Bitcoins up until a certain price point - $12k. Does Bill keep buying Bitcoins? If so, he keeps raising the price until it is at an insane level.
I doubt Bill would be able to buy 100k of those million bitcoins that he wants before the price goes into the $50k/bitcoins. It would be a long, painstaking process.
He would literally be inflating the entire value of the coin by creating scarcity. Could he do this? Yes, technically.

I know this is a low effort (if it can be called that) post, but "the other sub" is of a coin that has **quadrupled** its value in 3 weeks.

You can't say you want to be secure and that you use coinbase in the same sentence. Any coins on an exchange are not yours.
Buy a hardware wallet. Trezor or ledger. 
You keep your own private keys and thus have full control over your coins.
Treat your investment as seriously as possible. You wouldn't leave $10k lying around in someone else's place, right? Coinbase is exactly that.
Sorry on mobile, post didn't finish. Hardware wallets are protected by a pin and a set of randomly generated keywords you copy down and must keep safe. They are your pass back into your coins if you ever lose the pin or the device. The seed words should be kept in a very protected place since they are your keys, if anyone steals your keys they can Rob your home, so to speak. Keep them safe.

Do you have a quiet environment that is well ventilated?
Antminers are noisy industrial machines, look up a couple of videos of them running. They are a vacuum cleaner on at full volume 24/7 and they produce a good deal of heat. You will need efficient soundproofing or an industrial area to keep them where no one will be bothered by the noise.
You will also need proper electrical hookups and an electrician to make sure nothing fries. 1500w per dedicated circuit is what you need.
Antminer s9s are currently the best though they are aging. I'd say if you got them now and started them running they should be profitable for another year. Likely sometime mid 2018 new miners will be hitting the market and hitting your bottom line but no one can predict that.
Long answer but if you have the space and resources, yes mining is profitable. You will have to replace equipment at some point as it becomes obsolete so keep those costs in mind.

1:1 BTC/BCH. If you own 1 BTC, also own 1 BCH. This saves you headaches worrying about BTC/BCH going down or up, if one is going up, the other is going down. Think of "Bitcoin" as the accumulated value of all of Bitcoin's forks. If you own them all, all you have to care about is the total ledger value of Bitcoin.
For instance, each Bitcoin I own is worth $9,731 - $8,157 + 1,574. Easy and worry free.
Some ETH. Some IOTA.
Other possible useful ones are the mineable coins - ZEC, XMR, DASH. Just haven't bought into any of them yet.

So, another thing to watch, if you like trends and that kind of thing:
Trading (waking) hours are about to begin in China, who cannot trade on their exchanges. As usual, they will use  to trade.
China generally *loves* Bitcoin Cash in terms of Trade Volume - It usually outtrades Bitcoin in Total volume pretty generously. Today is no exception.

If China wakes up and mass panic sells, you could see $8k+ in a couple of hours.

    type: text submission
    action: remove
    action_reason: "Twitter post"

        This submission has been removed because Twitter links are only allowed in text posts with more than 215 characters. Please [submit a text post]( and use the text post body to provide your own thoughts to start a discussion.
Basically, the idea is to start discussion in the post. You'll find when big news is posted, it becomes a shitpost for karma/attention race. People learn pretty quick when their post gets shelved, and in the end, the extra blurb people put in ends up prompting at least some kind of discussion. Also, when actual big news is posted, it'll get posted regardless of how many posts get removed - Just the properly formatted ones get the accolades.

No one knows, really.
Couple things could happen:
- Difficulty readjusts, miners could come back to core. Bitcoin Cash drops a little, Bitcoin rises a little.
- Difficulty readjusts, miners stay mining Bitcoin Cash at a minor disadvantage. Bitcoin lowers, Bitcoin Cash rises, because mempool rises above 200+ and remains there for 2 weeks.
- Difficulty readjusts, miners mine Bitcoin Cash because it is actually *more profitable* even despite difficulty. This would result in a disaster for Bitcoin, and a huge rise for Bitcoin Cash.
I would say these are listed in order of likely to happen to unlikely to happen. But all are possibilities.

People were "waiting for a dip" on Friday and guess what, the price went up $1000+ and now you have to buy in at $9100

The bigger a sub reddit gets, the more moderation is required. More people flood in, lowering the quality of posts, spreading disinformation, spamming low quality memes (which everyone of course up votes) and in general making the place a garbage dump.
What most people call ,"censorship" is simple forum moderation. With contentious topics such as a split ledger, there will always be people unhappy with the state of one sub reddit and there will be a flow of people into another sub reddit.
People on r/btc were complaining about censorship stats that showed r/bitcoin removed 3,800 posts in October, thinking it was an "insane amount of censorship".
Over on r/leagueoflegends we removed 18,500 posts in October, or 600% more in the same timeframe.
This is simply how larger subreddits work. As more people flow in, more posts need to be removed, more comments removed, more people banned. 
I can't speak about how the r/bitcoin mods do their thing or what criteria they use, but " censorship" doesn't exist on a privately owned subreddit. The subreddit is owned entirely by the moderators who create and maintain it, and you have no god given right to post or participate in it.
If you are banned, you are free to create another community others will participate in and that's what r/btc has become, but giving the moderators here shit for doing volunteer trash duty is silly.
If they want to have a rule where you can't discuss altcoins here, and you didn't read the rules, that's just how it is. Just like you can't call people pedophiles on r/leagueoflegends 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:45:07
Currently the two chains are roughly equal to mine.
Honestly, as they were once the same ledger, it makes more sense this way anyway, instead of having miners flop back and forth constantly.
If they can simply pick whatever coin appeals to them with equal profit on either, the network will be more stable as a result. Less huge heaves, more steady blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:21:52
You're a chump if you're always waiting for dips to buy.
Buy whenever you have money and want to invest.
If your goal is a long term investment, you shouldn't give a shit whether the price is $8000 or $7500 per coin. Your goal is far away, 3-4 years from now.

I called $6000 pre-fork, but there's been some pretty strong BCH support.

Hey, this guy gets it.
As long as there is demand for differing versions of Bitcoin, and both chains are profitable, demand for both will rise. If both chains are equally profitable, miners simply point their ASICs towards the chain of their choice, and things over the course of a couple weeks will get more stable.

Ok, so, if for some bizarre, unlikely reason this does happen, it is because of these actors:
- [Bixin]( - 1.36% hashrate
- [Bitclub]( - 2.05% hashrate
- [BTCC]( -3.18% hashrate
- [GBMiners]( - 1.36% hashrate
These 4 have mined NYA blocks longterm.
They would make up roughly 7.95% of total hashrate if they all swapped. It is likely they all will.
"Minor support being strong" is incredibly unlikely. If launched this will almost certainly be a stillbirth.

There's concern trolling on both subreddits, can't just pretend only the big bad BTC trolls come here - is also filled with people from here talking about "Bcashic" or making stupid comments, so that's not something unique to either subreddit.
I'd say there are equal number of trolls on both sides, and I've purposefully removed them from my analysis - Does no good to consider these people. I've had people on say I'm a "Core shill" because I post on and I've had people on say I'm a "btc shill" because I post on - Regardless of the fact I regularly post about both literally every single day.
There are stupid people on each side which should not be considered.

If you are looking at bitcoin as a long term buy (which you should), it makes no sense to wait for it to go down before buying, especially $100 worth.

Once it breaks that barrier, you're going to see 12k faster than you believe.
Its just a big number, easy psychological barrier to hit. After we hit it, literally all bets are off.
Look at  - yesterday there was the battle for 10k, today the demand has gone bananas. Trading at 11.2k+ and people are devouring them. China is just waking up. Korea is waking up. They might see 12k a coin by tomorrow over there while all the smaller exchanges are still holding onto the psychological barrier.
Once you Pierce it though, that's the floodgate moment. All shit is off when it happens.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:54:05
I mean, that's great, except:
- You can do that with other cryptos without that fee, in a faster time
- You can do that with banks/paypal without that fee, in a faster time
- Sometimes you can't do that, because the mempool takes a giant shit or miners are off on another chain
Like I said, bitcoin isn't *bad*. It just currently isn't good.
If you want $10k, $50k, $100k+ - Or if you want public knowledge, it has to be a streamlined, sexy bitch of a cryptocurrency. Currently, it's a nice safe crypto that's a little slow. I just think it could be better. :)

@_date: 2017-11-14 02:37:05
As do you, though from a different angle.
I guess my main point is to try to see it from an investor standpoint - Look at it as if you were buying BTC. Say you wanted to make a really big investment in Bitcoin because you heard huge news was coming - So you remortgaged your house and put your savings on the line - $400k worth.
You bought Bitcoin at $6,000 and the news BALLOONED Bitcoin. Absolutely went crazy, over $10k! You decide for your future, it is safe to sell and you don't want to do anything too crazy. The price might go up more, but you are not willing to risk it.
Except, you notice, the exchange has shut down. Trading volumes are too high. The site is offline. 
Suddenly, news from everywhere begins to report that the huge bitcoin news is absolutely false. Bitcoin's price begins to drop, people begin to panic. You begin to do the same. You have almost $700k in funds on the exchange - But can't access them.
Worldwide panic begins. Bitcoins price begins to tank. Lower, lower. It's at $9k now. $8k. Your profit wastes away - But you still can't access your coins! It's been hours. No sign from the exchange that anything will change any time soon.
The panic selloff begins. Bitcoin's price drops to $6k. Your profit is entirely gone. You're in full panic mode - Calling the exchange, freaking out, you decide to go over in your car, phone on autodial the entire way. The doors are shuttered. Panic outside as thousands of people try to crowd past security at the doors.
Almost half a day has passed. Bitcoin has dropped to $3k. You've lost $200k from your initial investment. The exchange finally reopens for business.  You can access your coins again, but they are worth half of what you bought them for. They may rise in the future, but you have to wait for that.
Do you accept this? I don't think many people would.

That's besides the point though, the point is that the hodl mentality is to ignore dips and trends. *no one does this though*. They panic and freak out, start blaming China or Russia or Johan wu, or paid trolls or whatever the fomo is.
Obviously all of reddit is not one person or a group of people, but my main point is that if you have bitcoin you simply should invest when you can, sit back and have a beer. Your investment is long term and the more you worry about nothing, the worse off you will be.

- fixing transaction times and the mempool
- making it a usable currency for everyone, not just those who are rich
- more asic manufacturers = better mining profits = more miners
- merchant adoption via low fee quick transaction policies
As long as bitcoin is a "store of value" only it will never hit 'the moon'. It has to be as usable, obtainable, understandable, and valuable as cash currently is.
Currently it Is neither of those three. It is a domain of computer geeks.
If you want to push bitcoin into being a world currency, it must do things as good as (and better) than the current ones. 
You must be able to go into best buy, purchase a headset, flash your bitcoin whatever and pay for it then leave. You must be able to buy a car or stocks with it. You must be able to use it and not have it be a hassle for you or the merchant providing the service.
Those are the next steps. Bitcoin is not there yet.

Depends how high BCH rises.
If you want a random Redditor's prediction, BCH will probably push $2k-$2.2k on the weekend due to the difficulty adjustment (even though it won't even be a bad thing for BTC, it will trend slightly down, but perception is different than reality) and BTC will likely dip to $7,700. Tonight BCH will likely rise to $1800 or so.
This is definitely not the time to buy BTC if you were holding a wad of cash - Wait a couple days and the price will almost certainly be better. 
Just my 2 cents though.
Just updating this for those curious - BCH rose to $1,780 (I was $20 off) and BTC to $7,880. Since then, BCH leveled off back to around $1,700 (Up $400 on the day) and BTC back up to $8,130, as of 10:30 pm EST.
It's actually likely that both sides will probably be pushed over the weekend - BTC will be forking into Bitcoin Diamond within a couple of days and BCH will be doing their usual mining swap as per BTC's difficulty adjustment in the next day or so.

I mean, while people are meming and sandbagging, it still remains a legitimate coin that has increased from $300 to $1700 (with some weird $2500+ spike inbetween) in the course of 3 weeks.
If BTC had done that, there would be parties in the streets. I get that people don't like it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist and that it's not worth money.
Plus, it's silly to hate something you literally got for free for owning Bitcoins. If you sold it immediately, not really anyone's fault except, well..

Cryptos look to have a bright future in a few years time. They could also fizzle, be replaced with better tech or somehow regulated. 
No one really knows. Just like investment funds can dip or stocks can fail, so too could bitcoin.
If you have extra money you are OK with losing in theory, go for it.

Trezor/Ledger are more or less the same. They'll run you about $100 shipping and customs included.

Well, technically that's what Lightning Network will be for, to push forward instant transactions and make it back into a currency again.
Currently it's more like a Giant Balloon, with other Coins like ETH/BCH taking up the instant transfer niche. 
When the BTC devs iron out LN, it'll move back forward to being a currency again.

*Cryptocurrency is used so little for actual spending
If you [look at the graph of overall crypto transactions]( you'll notice the daily transactions for all cryptocurrencies combined is about a million / 24 hours.
VISA on its own processes 150 million per 24h.
Cryptocurrency is in its infancy. You may know about it and enough people to start fueling the fire might know about it, but it is nowhere near cash or visa yet.
It's getting there. It's taking its first tentative steps. But it isn't going to smash any records.

Wrong sub and will likely be deleted, but personally, you should have an equal share of both.
I know people on both sides like to hate one or the other, but like it or hate it they are both part of bitcoin and both will have value.
If you believe it will continue to rise (highly likely) the best time to get some would've been a few days ago, and the best time before that is when it was lounging at 300.
Not sure I would buy in at 1500 but that's up to you.

Jesus, quit calling it an attack and learn what you're doing.
[Behold, the mighty mempool](
This gets congested when there are tons of transactions. Mining gets blocks, which contain transactions, which lower the mempool.
Miners are not obligated to mine a certain chain. Currently another chain is more profitable to mine, thus miners are there instead of BTC's.
Your transaction is slow because there's a gigantic backlog.

You want to do your own research here. I suggest:
This is the difficulty level. Put in current price, put in 14 TH/S. Subtract $100 a month for electricity.
Every month, you make approximately 8-10% less than this. Factor that into your cost. 
You can mine Bitcoin Cash at approximately the same value - It's using the same algorithm. 
You will reach ROI in roughly 6 months - After that is profit. By then your s9 will be fairly dated, likely a new machine will be out, it's nearing the end of its maximum production period.

Who do you think those private companies pay taxes and infrastructure money to? 
I know people on Reddit are distanced from reality sometimes, but this is incredibly silly. Everything involved in generating a bitcoin, from property, internet, computer equipment, housing, electricity, infrastructure, and companies involved is taxable.
I realize that people WANT to be able to say they are safe from taxation, but that's simply not how it works. Maybe it's an American paranoia thing?
You pay into a system that allows you to do these things - Whether you are mining or turning your fiat into bitcoin on an exchange, it is able to be taxed, and whether some random guy on Twitter says otherwise will not change that.

I mean, Bitcoin's basic premise is *"Fuck the banks."*. Expecting a financial advisor who invests or is involved in banking to steer you towards an asset he cannot manage to tell you to be involved in Bitcoin is probably expecting the wrong thing.
The whole thing with Bitcoin is anti-establishment - A financial advisor is establishment.
It's a big thing in law and finance right now and it's only going to get bigger. Banks are giant parasites that offer little value to "customers" who store their money, and highly likely this is why Bitcoin is catching fire so fast - People are tired of getting no value for their investments.

- be able to ship in a useful timeframe, not in five months when superior machines will likely exist

Antminer s9 are still "the best" in terms of value, but I'd say they are on their way out. In a year give or take their profitability will be kaput.

Simple, once you have the wallet set up, you plug it in, enter your secure pin, then you set a receive address.
If you are mining, put that receive address in, and when you reach the threshold set by your mining pool, they simply transfer to your wallet address.
If you're buying, simply put that same wallet address in as the receiving address, and you're set!

Ok, so, you can't have a "mining rig" that mines bitcoin these days. You have two options:
- [Making something that is like this]( to mine on [Nicehash]( to be paid out in bitcoins
- [Buy Antminer s9s]( from Bitmain (The manufacturer) or from Ebay, because Bitmain and their website sucks.
Nothing else will mine bitcoin.
Do some research and make sure to have your power checked out beforehand. Also, learn how to soundproof a box or something with proper air ventilation if you do the s9s, they're loud.

Who cares? It's not like they're investing in it. Either they understand it or they don't.
It's not your job to convince anyone to invest in something profitable. Banker friends aren't going to like things that take money out of banks, and family won't understand it anyways, so talk about it with like minded people if they don't want to listen.
At the same time, you don't want to be "that guy" who always talks about his investments either - Imagine having a stock broker friend who always talks about which stocks are rising when you don't care even a little bit about them - If people don't want to listen, you don't have to educate. :)

Printer here.
Consider using this instead, obviously it's a quick hackjob - You can edit it with my tips, don't use this one, it's just for visual representation.
Here's why and how:
- Don't fuck around with round corners. Most places don't do them and it's not worth the pain.
- Too much gray, not enough colour. Changing the bitcoin to bitcoin colours should "liven it up" a bit. 
- Too much clutter, like said.
- Change your back black to 60/40/40/100 instead of your CMYK mash. You'll be happy when you print them, you'll get a nice rich black instead of a questionable one.

This alone says "I should not be buying bitcoin".
My normal advice would be to spend what you can afford, but it doesn't look like you can afford to be buying bitcoin whatsoever. It sounds like you have so much debt over your head that you're not going to be able to buy in.
So really, all you can do is:
- Buy a Nano like you want to
- Set up a verified exchange account
- Spend whatever you can afford and hope creditors don't break your kneecaps
Eventually the debt will catch up to you if you don't pay off, so I would probably take care of that first....

How you do it is up to you, but I wouldn't count on a low buy order right now. If you happen to have spare money lying around to hit a dip, great, but like I said in the thread, I don't think it's going down anytime soon.
You can set a buy order at like, $7,700 or something, but there's no reliable way that'll ever get filled.  If it does, it's likely because the price is dropping to $7,400 or something, so you bought $300 higher than you needed to, and it would've been better to just time it.
Sometimes I can see you're busy or don't have liquidity though, so if you want to trust buy orders, they're not bad. Just know they won't always function as you want.

Alright, I'm going to give you some honest answers here. 
- An Antminer s9 is best for directly mining bitcoin. If you can manage to buy from Bitmain's garbage site, it will cost you roughly $1400 USD in BCH, since that's all they take these days. Otherwise, you will have to buy them off ebay, and the going rate is at the very minimum $2500 each. Expect to pay $3000. 
- If you want to mine using [nicehash]( using GPUs and having them pay you in bitcoin, you want to set up a [Rig that looks like this]( - Basically, a bunch of GPUs, a processor, a mobo and risers all hooked up. This will run you $2000-$3000 depending on what kind of cards you get.
You cannot mine Bitcoin with GPUs. If you want to go the second route, [here is a good guide](
If you want to get an s9 to mine, [here is a good setup video](
I have done both.  Both are fun for different reasons.

I don't think you'll be downvoted because you're wrong necessarily, you'll be downvoted because you sound like a paranoid person who doesn't know much about computers - There are quite a lot of things in the world that are "literally backed by computers", yaknow.
Which is strange, because your profile states you're 23, which just means you're probably paranoid or don't understand the tech. That's fine.
People have had enough of low-reward banks and investment funds, quite likely. Investment funds will always be there if people want a slow, boring return of 5-10% a year, banks will be there if you want to get 0% return.

As with every one of these posts that are posted roughly 300 times a day, the answer is always the same:
- Do you know what Bitcoin is, or why you should invest in it?
- What's your exit point? Do you have an exit point?
- Can you afford to lose the money you invest?
- Do you believe in the tech behind Bitcoin, and do you think it will appreciate in the span of 2-5 years in the future?
- Do you understand what you're getting into?
Bitcoin in a few years could be worth $500k. It could also be worth $0. Money you invest here could be lost, changed, burned, destroyed, or go up in tears. It could also make you extremely rich, or it could end up staying at the same price for the next 3 years.
If you have money to spend, and you don't mind all these factors, invest.

See, this is kind of what I mean, right? 
Sure, it's a great "store of value". Like I said, I own BTC. The issue is acceptance and merchant value. You might not notice, but there aren't a lot of stores in strip malls these days hocking gold bars. However, pretty much every store these days accepts many payment methods to get their customers into the doors.
First, you can drop the shitty, condescending *do everyone a favour and go back to paypal* attitude to someone who's discussing how to improve your currency.
Second, Bitcoin *is a currency*. It should be functional enough to be used as one. It's getting there, but it could use improvements. You should be welcoming this kind of talk, not dismissing it. It'll help raise your value in the long run, whereas telling businesses to *"Fuck off until you're cool enough for Bitcoin"* is totally worthless.

I mean, *you* call it a pump and dump.
Miners are free to point their equipment to wherever they want.
Saying *"the vast majority of the bitcoin community"* wants something is an entirely meaningless sentence. We're talking about mempool use and congestion because the chain isn't being mined.
This is literally how bitcoin works. It runs off of Mining PoW. When the chain isn't being mined, the transactions slow down. That's how it has always worked.
It doesn't matter what you think "the community" wants - If legacy isn't being mined, transactions will be slow.

Well, there are going to be multiple barriers to pass. Everyone has their own *"I'm going to sell at x amount"* point, the question is does the excitement of a rising price overcome that?
I'm sure you've seen the article detailing the average selling price of a Bitcoin for users who have been holding - Some fanciful made up number like $162,000 or whatever it was, so it depends.  Is the trajectory going to explode so fast that people will not even think about selling because it's going up so much? (Unlikely)
Or will it be a slow, steady climb, with selling points at something like $8k, $8.2k, $8.4k? (Highly likely)
I say the next point is an $8k breach - Followed by some excitement up to $8.1, then down below $8k again for a while. It'll waffle up and down from there before going up again.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:40:02
Well, you could try to "rebuy at the dip"

Btc fluctuates way less in percentage than you think and is an expensive buy in.
Compare it to a more fluctuating currency like bch at the moment which generally flows an average of 10%+ up and  down during the span of a day.
You may think bitcoin has huge fluctuations but think about it in terms of Money you have to spend to day trade and profit margin.
Say you have 10k. It gets you 1.3ish btc or 7ish bch. Very rough numbers since on mobile.
Btc goes up $300 but that's only 4% so you made 4% profit. Bch goes up $150 but thats 10% of the value so you made 10%.
The bigger the asset, the harder it is to day trade.
This is using a volatile asset in bch, its even better to trade small Cryptos like neo zcash or stuff like that, because small fluctuations up or down are easy to buy into and profit from.
The bigger the beast, the less effective day trades are.

So, if you care about the price, you **should** care about the usability of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin will not topple any governments being "a store of value". It will not replace cash. It will not hit 100k, or higher.
It has to be usable and it has to be a sleek, sexy technology.
If you want Bitcoin to appreciate in investment terms, you have to be willing to accept it has flaws, and poke holes in those flaws so it can be fixed. Doing otherwise is sabotaging your own investment, because it will never rise to the level you want it to rise to by you putting horse blinders on yourself and chanting *It doesn't have to be a currency* to yourself.
It has to be a usable currency to moon. This is not a debate. You might not care about its usability, but it has to be a functional currency, it has to be an adaptable currency, it has to have merchant and market value, and it cannot only be a fucking gold bar.
Everyday people don't use gold bars. You want this to get to everyday people to raise the price.

has a *vast* "newbie" populace that is largely ignorant of what Bitcoin is. I scan /new queue every day and this is incredibly obvious. This isn't a bad thing - Early adopters come in all the time, the point I'm trying to make is that has very few "new" people and is mostly the same crowd.

No problem.
A good example of this is [Bitcoin Cash]( - Today it bottomed out at $860. However, within an hour it almost immediately went up to $1050. It's still rising now, as it's Chinese trading hour and they generally love it.
Now, you could've been waiting for that dip - But unless you caught it at the *exact* hour, you wouldn't have even known that it went up 25%. You "could've" made a 25% return.
Just like if Bitcoin goes down 600$ or something, but it only lasts for an hour. Yeah, *technically* you could've gotten in there, but it's pretty unlikely, right?
If you're day trading, buying dips makes sense. (Although day trading bitcoin doesn't make any sense, price doesn't fluctuate 10-20% in a day like some other coins) If your goal is to build up though, just sock away. :)

I mean, you bought into that when you bought Bitcoin. It isn't that Miners suddenly appeared and scooped up all the juicy money, this is how it's been forever. Miners control transactions and their speed.
All of your second statement is conspiracy theory, likely fueled by the current front page.  BCH is the refuge for the people who supported S2X (and yes, there were a lot of those people) where they can go and see their vision of bitcoin be realized.
Once again, Miners do not owe Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, or any chain their allegiance. They can mine whatever they like.  If Bitcoin is not the profitable chain, then it will be mined less.
This is the definition of a decentralized market.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:50:03
What do you mean by "sustain"? Should a currency that has a set number of coins that people can possibly own have a set value?
Who sets that value? The free market of people who trade it - So what are we really sustaining?
Currently the market thinks the bitcoin ledger is worth $8700 - Bitcoin at $7700 and Bitcoin Cash at $1000. There's nothing to sustain. If the market thinks that value is less, people will sell it, if the market thinks that value is  more, people will buy it.
I see no reason the Bitcoin Ledger's combined price should go anywhere but up in the future. The amount of circulating coins is finite and adoption is still in its infancy.

Wait, you're seriously blaming businesses for not using an inefficient transaction method?
This is like blaming miners for mining a coin that's more profitable. 
Businesses, like miners, are there to make money - If you give them a choice between an effective, efficient, and cheap payment method (Credit Card, Paypal, Bank transfer) and a safe but currently clunky payment method (Bitcoin), why on earth do you think businesses wouldn't use them?
Bitcoin is not mainstream. It is still a niche thing. However, if you want to get it mainstream, you *absolutely have to make it efficient and you absolutely have to make it competitive in the pricing/transfer method*. This is not up for debate - This is something the technology needs in order to survive and scale into the future. For it to be adopted by the average joe, it must have this.
Blaming businesses for not using a currently ineffective system is nonsensical.

I don't understand fiat? **You literally just blamed businesses for not adopting a method that is currently inferior to their current methods.**
Think about what you're writing again. Businesses do not give two shits about whether Blockchain is an amazing technology or if Bitcoin is a great store of value. They want a technology  that helps customers process payments and they want more customers. The system that delivers more of these customers is the winner in the eyes of small business.
Think of it this way. I have ETH, BTC and BCH. I am a small business. I can:
- Accept ETH - Not many people will use it, but transactions are nearly instant and nearly free.
- Accept BCH - More people will use it, and transactions are similar to ETH. 
- Accept BTC - The most people know about this, but transactions are sloppy and slow.
If I am a business, why am I choosing the sloppy and slow option? 
This is literally all it comes down to for business adoption - Whether or not you can use the payment method efficiently and whether or not it is cost effective.
Bitcoin is getting there - But blaming Businesses for not adopting it when it doesn't fill their needs is another level of silliness. This is literally putting on horse blinders when we should instead be wanting a much more functional solution.

Your goal is to somehow spread the idea that this entire venture is silly, an area where you will find no support.
Unfortunately, the way you will take it is that everyone other than you is illogical, and is throwing their money into a pit.
I've had worse investments than bitcoin. I've moved across the world multiple times. I've been in bad breakups. I've spent money to live places where I got zero percent return on my investment and somehow, life has moved on, I live a happy, fulfilling life, and Cryptos are some of my investments.
If bitcoin fell to zero tomorrow, I would shrug my shoulders and move on with my life.
Life is full of risks. If you want to invest in your 6% per year investment fund, go ahead. Like banks, they will always be there, willing to give you the minimum while they take the maximum.
It is the easy way. There is no shame in doing it, technically it makes sound financial sense.
You find it silly. That's fine, my parents find it silly. They do not understand technology, risk, or the environment of the world today. You sound like a similar person, likely an older risk averse person. Its possible you are younger and simply scared. Nothing really wrong with that, you just don't mesh well with people who are willing to get creative.
No one is reading this far down by now but I figured I'd try one more time - other people can invest in different things than you'd enjoy or support, and thats OK. No one wanted computers, or telephones, or a space shuttle, but people created them anyways and pushed innovation forward.
Very few people understand the workings of a stock market, or an online marketplace like amazon, but they still exist and still operate, even though they are not physical things. 
That's just the direction technology is moving. Its fine if you don't understand it or are afraid - a lot of people are risk adverse. 
Have a good one.

So basically [every single other time the mempool has risen](
People need to take off their tinfoil hats. The mempool will rise and fall based on demand and need. When a HUGE amount of miners think a chain is profitable, they will switch to it.
Instead of just calling it an attack, use your brain, do research - Look [at the list of pools on Btc.com]( If you're a miner (Which I'm sure you're not, since you're in here calling something an attack, something someone who mines wouldn't do) you'll notice in the bottom left there seems to be a large gap of hashpower.
That is because people are not mining the legacy chains. 
As a direct result of this, block reward increases because mempool congestion is high.
Again, if you do not mine, your opinion is irrelevant to how mining is done. If you want to influence what hashpower is going into Bitcoin, you are free to purchase ASICs.

Alright, so although electricity is a part of mining, its not even a large part. Here is what you need:
- a soundproofed room with proper air ventilation to outside. Failing this, an isolated, detached house or warehouse space. These are loud.
- equipment. L3+ or s9 will run you at least $2500-3300 USD each and demand for both is rising. You cannot buy them from bitmain.
- patience. Each miner has a 5-8 month roi with increasing difficulty. You need to run them 24/7.
- knowledge. You need proper electrical setup with proper circuiting so you don't incinerate your investment or house.
- research. You need to do some since you are asking about the very basics. 
Do some research, figure out your own situation, find out how long it would take to profit, and make your own informed decision about how much it would cost you vs how much you would make and how long it would take.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:18:20
They're pretty close in volume, though bithumb has historically been known for trading BCH (Since the chinese have a big stake in it) 
Just for volume comparisons, Bitfinex did 400m to Bithumb's 300m yesterday, 9% and 7% of the market respectively, the biggest movers overall

I don't know why you'd feel bad about other people making bad business decisions while you make good business decisions.
People buy into Bitcoin at ATH and panic sell in dips. I don't feel sorry for them. People buy into actual shitcoins. People buy stocks that are crashing, or penny stocks.
There's a vast difference between making a profitable business decision and taking a gigantic risk. Sometimes, the two can mix and you can get lucky, but you also run the risk of it going south.
I guess the moral of the story is, you are able to profit and hold both coins - But be moderate in your approach of either.

Holy fuck.  
Yeah, don't buy from scam sites. Look at the prices on that shit. Use [coinmarketcap]( and [Coindesk]( to determine the USD value (It's usually somewhere in the middle - If Coindesk is $9658 and Coinmarketcap is $10000, it's probably around $9829)
Translate into Canadian dollars - &gt; $9,829 &gt; $12644.71 - Trading on Quadriga for 12800 right now, so pretty accurate, off by 1%.
If you bought on canadianbitcoins.com you'd be paying $14220 for $12,644 bitcoins, or a 13% upcharge.

Alright, here's my plan.  I'm sure others will echo it in some way.
BTC is a long term bet. If you want to make short term gains, buy some shitter altcoin that's a penny stock or something, then you can day trade and hope to bank it big.
BTC can go up or down a few % but it doesn't really matter, it's too fat to day trade these days unless you're a millionaire. You grab it and you stuff it into a wallet, and you let it out when it's grown bigger.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:56:33
Mentioned this earlier, but may as well post it again.
If for some bizarre, unlikely reason this does happen, it is because of these actors:
- [Bixin]( - 1.36% hashrate
- [Bitclub]( - 2.05% hashrate
- [BTCC]( -3.18% hashrate
- [GBMiners]( - 1.36% hashrate
These 4 have mined NYA blocks longterm.
They would make up roughly 7.95% of total hashrate if they all swapped. It is likely they all would swap.
"Miner support being strong" is incredibly unlikely. If launched this will almost certainly be a stillbirth. They need miner support, which they will not get.

You cannot mine bitcoin with a graphics card - The difficulty long ago rose far too high to do that kind of thing without ASICs, basically a computer with hundreds of chips on it specifically to do bitcoin equations

Personally, I thought when S2x came, the price would crater to $6k, I've been posting about it constantly
S2X died, so that goes to BCH instead, which is also no surprise
Think of it this way:
- If you own BCH (Some of us do), you get the excitement of watching it rise
- If you own BTC, you get to buy new coins at a cheaper price
Frankly, if you own Bitcoin and you're constantly checking its price to see if you're "making money", even though you're not planning on selling it for 10 years, you're doing it wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:22:55

Alright, 2 hours ahead of schedule, we've got BTC 7900 - BCH - $1076. 
A total "cashening" is incredibly unlikely - However, BCH retaining a ton of its value is actually very likely.  
Unlike Gold, Silver, or any of the other actual scammy altcoins, BCH is a pretty good fork. It might have the support of some known shysters, but it has Relay Protection, a good layer of security, and remains fairly true to Bitcoin.
I'm just happy to see the ledger push 9k. Exciting times.

If you're listening to the tether hysteria, you're silly.

I'll give you a good sum up:
- Bitcoin was under a lot of pressure because of the S2X hardfork, which is now cancelled
- Bitcoin was also under a lot of pressure from Bitcoin Cash, which solves a lot of problems in terms of fees but creates new ones in terms of security, among other things
- Bitcoin was fairly uncertain for a while but is recovering
Currently, I think while Bitcoin has some issues that need to be fixed in regards to the mempool, segwit adoption, quick transactions and fees, it is in one of the more stable states it's been for a while.
If you're looking to buy now is a good time. The price will likely rise for the near future.

They frequently use zombie and compromised accounts and evade bans by using sketchy redirects. Couple of months back they rebranded to coinbeat and have been doing this ever since. 
Accounts are always unused, usually for years, and show up posting crypto stuff. They will then submit coinbeat redirects and vote manipulate them (usually with 30-50 upvotes to push it to front pages of subs (like here).
They used to branch off coinbeat.whatever redirects, but have started to use stuff like cryptonews.fun and cryptonews.live to evade bans
If you check the submitters you will almost always see compromised accounts.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:07:09
Yeah, miners get bigger fees because of the congested network.
You as users get fucked and have to input better fees to "bribe" the miners to include your transaction in the blocks.
This is why it is important that the technology of Bitcoin itself stays nimble and accurate - It may be a good store of value, but if it is functionally worthless (Whether because of miners or something else) then Miners may prefer to mine the other fork - And that's bad for BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:15:15
I had actually guessed the price to crater to about $6k after the fork, now that the fork isn't happening, it's pretty much what I expected.
This is actually really good - My Bitcoin Cash goes up in value, and I can buy more Bitcoin. Best of both worlds!
I'd expect it to go under $6500 over the weekend, so if there are people holding on to buy for dips, that's the time to get it. As usual, you run the risks of it going back up, but I'm pretty sure it'll keep going down a bit more. 
There is value in both chains, so it's more of a siphon than a drop at this point :)

I can't speak for F2Pool (though it's obvious they've been upped in the last couple of days from how many blocks they've been hitting) but Slush always hovers at 7-8%.
Right now it's at 8.49 %.
A lot of the variance you're seeing is people jumping ship from BTC.top and likely into F2Pool. Antpool also had a big drop a couple days ago where it lost the  spot (if only for a day) - Think it was on the 21st, where it got only 25 blocks.
I can't really speak of the Chinese sites (BTC.top, F2Pool) but Slush is pretty consistently that 6th or 7th hashrate spot.

A hardware wallet is like a little uncrackable safe. Sure, if you're carrying around $20, you can probably keep it in your pants pocket. If you're carrying around $200, you can keep it in your wallet. If you're carrying around $2,000, you probably shouldn't use your pants or your wallet, and should keep it safer.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:54:58
If you have $10, you put it in your pocket.
If you have $100, you put it in your wallet.
If you have $1,000, you put it somewhere safer.
The same is true with any sort of cryptocurrency. If you have *"$10 invested"*, that isn't an investment, it's you putting a $10 bill somewhere. Go into a bank and ask to invest $10, and see what kind of a look the banker gives you.
If you're going to actually invest any sort of meaningful money into a cryptocurrency, you buy something where you can keep it safe and secure - That's a cold wallet.

$15-$20 a day, depending on blocks
The average block I get from slush is 0.00025 BTC (ish)
The average number of Slush blocks a day is about 11 (ish)
Like u/Softcoin said, this is about 0.00275 BTC/day
Or, $16
This can vary, so like I said, $15-$20

Not even going to look at that site and instantly say no.
I would say your best bet is ebay - Pay with Paypal since it's actually protected and no one can scam you. 
It's almost impossible to buy from bitmain.

@_date: 2017-10-28 05:51:40
Mm. Depends.
The s9 is about $3.20 in electrical a day. The $16 is before electrical.
Sometimes you'll hit $20. Sometimes you'll hit $14. 
If you check out [nicehash's calc]( you'll see that it's more or less the same thing.
With the difficulty increase, you'll see less frequent, but fatter blocks - One I just got was 0.000269 BTC.
If you look hard, you can probably get an S9 for $2500. Good luck getting one from bitmain.
[This is an example of the kind of ebay auction you'd see for one](
Note the 28 bids. They'll usually go for about $3k USD on ebay. Sometimes you can get lucky.
I cannot stress this enough - Good luck buying them from bitmain. If you can somehow brute force their terrible website (during the few times they sell s9s), and somehow bypass their awful login system, you better have bitcoin cash (Because they don't take BTC) and hope it goes through.

Never tried the Ledger - Apparently it's a solid wallet, but I definitely love my Trezor.
I don't think you can really go wrong with either one - But I chose the Trezor since when I ordered it, the Ledger site had a backlog of 2 months to ship it, and Trezor shipped it priority around the world in 2 days - Pretty easy choice to make for me.

Of course you're in it for money, there's no reason to lie.
Saying you're not in it for the money is like saying you go to work for fun, and not for your wage. Of course you go to work for a wage, and of course you are in Bitcoin for money.

Its currently at 754.4 Ph/s. Yesterday it was at 730.8 Ph/s.
The last time it was at  375 was in August.

As someone with both, take both subs with a grain of salt.
R/btc has its conspiracy theorists and passionate hatred towards anything other than a narrow worldview. R/bitcoin has its mindless memers, constant shitposting from shill accounts and all sorts of nonsense.
However the communities are not those specific people, reddit is filled with all sorts of different mentalities. Its just that its reddit in the end, circlejerk and exposure is what you get.
The key is to look objectively at both subreddits and get your information from both. More knowledge is more power.

Miners can signal whatever they want. 
Slush and F2pool are the pools that are reliably mining non NYA nodes, but miners are under no obligation to signal something different than what they want. 
Take a look at the [Block List]( and see the overwhelming NYA consensus.
Not that I think its a good or bad thing honestly - But they are well within their rights to point their equipment at whatever they think will be the best for them.

You cant get them for 2500 cad a unit.
They cost 105 a month to run.
They dont make 25$ a day. 
You need to actually do proper calculations, including difficulty increases before you ever even consider spending 50k on something you havent done research on.
Currently, an s9 on an amazing pool running 24/7 will get you 0.088btc/month. Each month the difficulty increases by approx 8%. 
You also need to factor in noise. You cant just put this shit in your house. You need proper electrical wiring and a sound proof room, or an industrial complex where no one hears 20 high powered vacuum cleaners going nonstop 24/7.

Depends on the amount you have invested.
Like any cryptocurrency, the more you have invested, the more you want a cold wallet like a Trezor or a Ledger. Just like in real life - If you have a larger amount of assets, you use a safe, or a bank or whatever else you trust them with.
The more money you keep on an exchange, the more you risk. The problem with being your own bank is that you also have to responsibly protect your own money - Keeping it on an exchange is not doing that.

It's as safe as any phone wallet, I suppose.
I wouldn't trust it with a large amount of crypto, but that's just me, I'm paranoid. 
If I had a couple hundred and I just wanted a quick storage, sure, why not. But then, I can afford to lose a couple hundred dollars - Which is what should be on your mind if you keep your wallet on an unsecured place like a phone.

Yeah, this is standard article editing 101 though - Make it sound like it's an issue to drum up clicks. No one here even read the article, which is standard for Reddit.
In case people actually want to read what this garbage article was about:
*“We are very concerned about that,” he elaborated. “The FBI’s very concerned about that. They did take down, I think, the two biggest, dark web sites. This last one, Alphabay, we took down recently. They had 240,000 sites where individuals were selling, for the most part, illegal substances or guns on that site, including Fentanyl. And, they use bitcoins and other untraceable financial capabilities, and it is a big problem,” he nodded.*
**Nowhere** does it say *Bitcoin* is a big problem, despite that being the article title. It's not even talking about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is only barely mentioned, in that it is being used as a payment method... big whoop.
This has nothing to do with Trump/Sessions hating, nothing to do with bitcoin, but I guess Dark Web isn't exactly a rollicking discussion topic.

If you don't have enough money in to afford a hardware wallet, it doesn't matter where you put your coins, because you won't profit from it anyways.
How much investment are we talking? $20? $50?
If you have enough invested that's over the price of a hardware wallet (Aka: Do you have **0.002** Bitcoins? - That's $100) - You should have a secure place to put them.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:05:51

I mean, just need more actual players in the ASIC market for bitcoin, really.
Currently, Bitmain is responsible for hashing, well, everything related to BTC. There isn't any competition - It's like you're living in Australia, where you only have the choice of one company for internet - If you want to mine Bitcoin, you use an ASIC, and no one sells them but bitmain.
Give it a couple years - Japan is entering the game, Korea will too.  This is just what happens when a monopoly wants to do something (Push a fork, enforce mining consensus) and there isn't any other option available.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:28:20
You cannot mine bitcoin on your PC.
If you do not have the money to purchase an ASIC miner, do not even attempt to mine bitcoin.
Purchase bitcoin instead.
Alternatively, GPU mining is an option. Use nicehash and its calculator. Do your research. A GTX 1050 with 2gb of vram will get you exactly nothing, you need a good card.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:35:46
Hmm, it depends on what you want to do and how you want to invest. 
Right now, the Altcoin market fluctuates heavily with Bitcoin, and since Bitcoin is soon to be forked (or who knows, really), you might want to wait before heavily investing in it.
Coins like Zcash, ETH, Ripple and whatnot are probably (very) long term buys if you believe in the project and their future viability. They're not very good for quick cashouts.
For speculation, the best coins are something like [MONA]( - The small coins that CAN skyrocket, or can just go bust.

- Forgot about it

Was a pretty miner problem, really. (Ha ha)
The difficulty adjustment was the biggest its ever been and there was some congestion, but blocks have been pretty regular since yesterday.
I don't even really think it had much of a difference other than the initial clog of 5-6 hours - Antpool did 29 blocks, which is their average, Slush did 10 (Average is about 11), F2pool did about 17.
Unconfirmed went up to about 70k, and has been decreasing slowly since then, down to about 50k.
Seems pretty normal with difficulty adjustment.

Any monkey can make a prediction based on information they don't have.

Most of the people who went through the GOX days were (unsuprisingly) fucked over by GOX, lost their coins, or otherwise got screwed over. It's highly unlikely most people have their coins from 2011 these days. The simple reason is that the lessons we know now (Use a hard wallet, make sure your shit's secure) very few people followed then. 
This led to the loss of most people's coins - Leaving big sums on untrustworthy exchanges, on phone apps, in unsecured places. We take this for granted, but during early adoption days, TONS of this stuff went missing or was janked from people. 
While it's possible this story is legit, it follows the same pattern as most of the bullshit scam stories on here:
- Make new account, talking about how *"Rich bitcoin has made you"*, how "*The banks fucked you over"*, or *"How bitcoin has changed my life"* 
- Offer absolutely no evidence, or a heavily photoshopped post that could've come from anywhere.
- Add absolutely no supporting information, but talk as if it's such an amazing thing that bitcoin has changed your life and is fantastic in every single way
- Disappear into the Ether
This is pretty much new queue here in a nutshell. Shill posts almost nonstop. has the paranoid conspiracy drones who post about how people are "censored" here, and has these shitposting throwaways who vomit out how fucking amazing Bitcoin is then disappear, never to be seen again until their next incarnation.
