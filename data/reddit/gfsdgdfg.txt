hardly panic selling. just a small number of people dropping the occasional block of BTC on the market (probably a miner who has no real reason to hold BTC for more than a minute). you forget how low the demand is for BTC; of course it can't sustain that kind of selling pressure. There just aren't enough people who have reasons to buy bitcoin for something other than 'the long run'.
really though dude, at the end of the day, almost 100% of the price of BTC is speculation. think about how much buying power BTC has (not much!). Its a good idea, and it could be something useful in the future, but that doesn't really mean much.

I don't understand why people don't sell when prices are overly inflated. It seems like the most beneficial thing for the BTC market would be for people to take responsibility and sell when demand is overwhelming and buy when its underwhelming, but instead you retards just sit there and act like going long is some kind of patriotic move worth circlejerking over while BTC volatility goes through the roof, making the currency illiquid for those who would really benefit from holding it, and way too volatile for it to ever be an acceptable payment method for merchants.
The number one thing holding back BTC is the community itself. You're all too irresponsible, immature, and trying way too hard to make easy money. If you're holding bitcoin "for the long run" you're trying to make easy money. If you actually believed in bitcoin you would do something real to help the currency, not hoard it.

you're not sorry now, but you will be. its not hard to educate yourself. I mostly concern myself with weekly charts. You do not need to be a hawk to see the details.
