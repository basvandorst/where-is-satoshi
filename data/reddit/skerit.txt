I was moving house around the time of the original claim (moving out of my parents house)
I do not remember which address I used for the original claim, and apparently I have to enter the original one even if I have since moved. What do I do now?

He also once said they were just having software issues and would re-allow withdrawals as soon as possible.
He lies, lies, lies. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:23:14
I guess people think that's the ideal time to buy in?

I actually went through a similar ordeal with another exchange: Bitfloor. Of course, they did not lose coins but had their assets frozen by their bank, but it still took a while 'till I saw my money again.
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:52:32
The more it crashes the less money I lost on MtGox.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:55:03
I remember the first crash. That was fun, as I had missed the bubble :P
@_date: 2014-12-26 17:44:34
In Belgium they still have them, and entire business models exist with the idea that people will never ever use them.
@_date: 2015-01-15 09:02:44
Thanks. I had coins on bitfloor, mtgox and bitstamp. I've seen my share of bitcoin disasters :P

Is it a DRM free stream I can just throw VLC against? Then yay!
@_date: 2011-06-11 13:46:32
So that's probably why I can't seem to buy any at even 15 dollars... One guy sold lots of them at a cheap price and they're gone now.
Anyway, what does "Another trade is still in progress, please retry in a few seconds" mean on Mt. Gox anyway?
@_date: 2011-08-10 09:23:03
The way I see it: a link can also be any transfer of money. When you give to or receive from an address that is logged for ever.
The only way to get rid of that is to launder the money in some form, like putting it in a new Exchange account and withdrawing it on another wallet at a different time (and then you have to hope the exchange never shares this information)
@_date: 2011-06-19 17:51:14
Ha, how I feel your pain! I just posted the same question a few days ago in the forum, maybe you've seen that one, too?
Anyway: I have a 6950 that refuses to work with the P5N-e sli. I was also wondering if it was because of the older pci-e specification, or too low voltages, but after plugging it in an even older motherboard things worked FINE.
So, I'm just here to confirm the bad news: they do not work together.
@_date: 2011-06-22 23:15:29
I actually do this all the time. I really hate it whenever I come across a website that won't allow my structured password.
@_date: 2011-06-10 22:24:06
I'm selling Belgian beers, candy, chocolate, snacks, ... over at 
@_date: 2011-07-02 12:14:43
And beer, candy, ... 
@_date: 2011-06-01 00:05:49
We've started with a basic offering of the best known Belgian goods. If you feel like anything is missing, don't hesitate to contact us. (We do not have "Westvleteren beer", though. It's very hard to get)
Bitcoin is the default currency when following this link, but you can choose USD, GBP and EUR too.
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:32:43
I'm sure lots of people, like me, weren't here when it happened and still have (or hope to have) a few hundreds of dollars worth of bitcoins on mtgox. 
So I'm rooting for a nice mtgox return.
@_date: 2011-08-01 07:08:47
Ohw. That's not normal, it should have arrived more than a month ago. I'll look into it.
*Edit: It departed customs on the 12th of june. No new entry has been made afterwards. I'll ask what happened to it.
@_date: 2011-06-08 07:43:36
A list like this?
@_date: 2011-06-11 12:32:25
Is it then even worth the while to get a new 6950 card?
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:37:36
Probably by sending new, temporary passwords by e-mail.
@_date: 2011-07-29 10:40:55
I ship to the UK: 
Selling Belgian beers and candy.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:04:16
Even though bitcoin is anonymous as you don't know who is using them, you DO know where they came from.
If I understand correctly: you can't ever launder bitcoins, as they're always traceable.
So once any of these hackers cash out through the limited means available at this time, can't we get all of their information?
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:30:37
1 cent, yeah... However: I did place a few very cheap buy orders in case anyone decided to cash out at a ridiculous price. It has happened before and I thought it could happen again.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:26:48
The bitcoin community is really strange that way. I've seen many newbies posting "NEW POOL AVAILABLE NOW!!" on the forum and... people *actually join them*. To me it seems like many bitcoin users aren't sceptical enough.
I'm creating a simple website for a few private users, but even there I'm using salts and sha512 to store all the passwords. It's very strange that a website that moves so much money around doesn't have the same thing.
@_date: 2011-06-27 15:21:55
Yeah, it was fluctuating a lot around 17-20
@_date: 2011-07-05 22:51:06
Same here. As a merchant who accepts bitcoins myself it REALLY is a nice way to transfer money, even if it is as a fiat currency.
@_date: 2011-06-08 19:28:39
Btw: Your package has shipped, you'll get your tracking number ASAP ;)
@_date: 2011-06-08 09:47:09
Sorry, I was away for a few days over the weekend, not monitoring Reddit.
Our shipping charges are stated in Euro, you can add something to your basked and immediately get the exact shipping cost (No need to checkout just to check it)
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:34:49
P5KPL-VM. It's an µATX board, but I believe my P5B-E will work too. (I just used it because I wanted to test it asap and it already had a cpu installed.)
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:34:52
But seriously, vtm is not the biggest television channel in Belgium. It has almost half of the viewership of één ;)
@_date: 2013-08-16 07:08:30
It accepted my swift code, but not my account number (saying it has to be numbers only)
So I just added the info to the address field.
@_date: 2013-02-12 09:59:34
Waffles, don't you mean... Argh, no. I can't do it.
@_date: 2013-08-17 13:12:43
Shouldn't the title be "is returning the money", because I still haven't gotten my money back. I wonder if any europeans have.
@_date: 2013-07-25 22:07:45
Have you had any luck so far? It's still not working here.
This seems like *such* a small thing to fix
@_date: 2013-07-25 22:05:38
This international user still can't make a claim. It keeps saying my swift key is invalid. On ALL my accounts.
