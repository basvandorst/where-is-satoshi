Well it's not a currency of any recognized country.. some people accept silver as a payment mechanism, but it is not VAT exempt. Gold generally is VAT exempt, but it's explicitly exempted in tax legislation.. there is no explicit exemption for bitcoins.. In the US there is no VAT.. there are only state (and sometimes county) applied sales taxes.. some states such as Delaware (where Bitpay and coinbase are incorporated) have a 0% sales tax rate.. so Bitpay/coinbase should be ok to buy and sell bitcoins and charge 0%. Dell itself does not touch bitcoins so I guess they're in the clear too.

No. It's a higher percentage however you could possibly value it.

on the other hand.. if the price goes up.. say $5k/BTC then they only sell 16k BTC leaving ~184k.. hopefully lots of the missing coins are owned by silkroad sockpuppet accounts that won't file a claim.. and suddenly everyone gets most of their money back.

No.. Almost all the assets are in BTC.. a lot of the liabilities are USD denominated. The higher the BTC price the higher the percentage that everyone will be paid out. To illustrate imagine if the price per btc was $80m.. now it only takes 1BTC to pay off all the fiat debt. That leaves still ~200k BTC to be split between the BTC creditors.. they will now get more BTC than they would get at current prices.
