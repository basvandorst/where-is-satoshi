I don't want to ICO, but believe bitcoin could absorb a lot of Ethereum's value if it was used to tokenize. There's more value in assets than in money. Trying to understand if/when bitcoin will participate in tokenization.
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:47:24
Yes please
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:59:46
I agree ICOs are generally harmful as they currently exist. However, tokenizing assets will be a valuable thing for blockchains to do in the long term. It would be nice if bitcoin could prove more publicly it is capable of Ethereum's claim to fame, but with better security.
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:14:01
For initial distribution, yes, but what about for mining?
