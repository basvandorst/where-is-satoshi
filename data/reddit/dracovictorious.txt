Indeed, as most people who are being introduced to bitcoin use or understand the dollar it makes sense to ease the transition with something familiar

The true test for bitcoin is replacing the usd, so absorbing its symbol seems par for the course

Bitcoin isn't for America at the moment. Bitcoin is for places like Venezuela where you can wake up with enough money to feed your family and arrive at the store without enough money to feed yourself. Places where seeing hundreds or thousands of dollars just lying on the ground is common and not worth the time or energy to bother with picking up.

Fair enough

*for the fees that miners demand
Otherwise, exactly.

@_date: 2018-11-21 00:14:01
Wait.. no.. keep doing that. That way I can get more in lol

Didn't know about it last December: true
Heard about it in September: true
Bought first amount today: true
People still getting in: I am part of the people, so true
Not sure where the lie is, newly created anti-bitcoin redditor. Care to elaborate?

I started talking about it to my family on Thanksgiving (granted, I found out about bitcoin late this year) now both parents want in on the dip 
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:23:38
Hell, I saw a sinking ship and jumped on board today. You don't be lonely at the bottom lol

The earliest comment I have on r/bitcoin is my first reply to this thread. Don't know why you're lying about something that can be checked so easily? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:34:41
Nah, reddit random button dropped me here a few months ago so I spent some time reading. Until then I had no idea what it was
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:59:06
Had no idea about it last December, found out about it in September, started participating today. There are people still getting in
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:41:20
Oh hey, that's what I bought in at today. 
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:37:34
Nah, you just need to worry about having a physical item that every common criminal can identify and walk away with. And doing business over distance is even harder with gold
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:27:03
Hodl the door
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:26:34
Wow, such generous.
