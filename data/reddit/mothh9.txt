The meaning of FUD is:
Fear, Uncertainty and doubt.
That means people are afraid of something which they don't know for sure and doubt that it will happen.

Don't use Block Explorer any more, they show Bitcoin Cash now by default.
Use  instead.

What does this mean for the US? How can a government even shutdown? Are they not paying their employees any more? Or what is going to happen now?

Oke, thanks for the answer.

It is a bech32 address.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:38:13
I did that as well which did give me a 3 address but Electrum said it might not always support BIP39 seeds.
Is an address that starts with a b a better version of Segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:48:38
Don't send it back, it might have been from an exchange, if you send it back the chances are the funds will be lost.
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:45:26
It isn't displayed as:
It is displayed as:
Notice the weird character under the n.
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:05:05
I used Electrum to generate a Segwit address and it starts with a b, is that the same as an address that starts with a 3 or is it something else?

No problem.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:41:03
1. Make sure you don't have any more Bitcoin in your wallet
2. Download 
3. Import your private key
4. Send it to Coinbase
5. Sell
The first 3 steps is what I did.
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:51:34
I see a lot of people shill for that company so I don't really trust it.
What are their fees?
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:35:19
So how do I import a Segwit private key to Electrum?
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:06:24
What would be? Installing an adblocker?
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:42:19

Hotmail also deleted all my emails.
It had over 20k unread emails.

Don't use those addresses any more, your funds will be stolen as soon as they get 1 confirmation.

Oke, thanks for the explanation.

No, it wasn't a map, it was a site with a searchbox where you could type in your country and then a list would be displayed with the companies in your country accepting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:29:55
I didn't read my emails but I did log in every once in a while.
I wasn't using them any more besides some password recovery stuff and now that they did this I certainly won't be using them any more for any other stuff even if they fix their shit interface.

But life isn't a scam, Bitconnect is a scam.

You are probably new to Bitcoin which is fine, welcome, we hope you have a good time.
At the moment the fees are really high, you can see the fee price here:
I recommend not doing small transactions until it has cleared.
Also, people recommend you send your Bitcoin to  and then withdraw it via that, I personally don't use Gdax so I don't know how that works.

If you didn't buy it via that and you downloaded the core wallet via  I suggest you export your private key and import it into a wallet such as Electrum to get instant access to your coins because it doesn't have to download the whole blockchain which is several 100gb.

@_date: 2017-11-26 19:36:33
Sell at $99.9k, there are a lot of people planning on selling at $100k I am assuming so you are better of putting a sell order in at a slightly lower price.

Mixing coins just means you sending coins to one address and them sending you coins back with a different address.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:51:40
Thanks, this pretty much answers it.
I already knew that the coins are stored on the blockchain, what I meant was if I where to go on the offline computer and go in the wallet, how would I see what my balance is if I have no Internet for a little while for example? Or is that not possible because it is offline(I assume it isn't)?
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:55:14

You can't have Paypal under 18, if they find out they will lock your account.
Even if you are over 18 but you registered your account while under 18, if they find out they will lock it, so attach a bank account to it and be careful.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:40:15
You can lower the standard fee amount and it shouldn't be that high compared to a credit card or international transfer.

NEVER share your private key with anybody.

You don't need to report taxes if you are under 18 as far as I know.

Lets say I create wallet on an online computer, I then send a few coins to it and then I turn the computer off.
