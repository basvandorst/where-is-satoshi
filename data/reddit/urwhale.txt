Wow, where these coins come from is pretty impressive:
most of these are from mining rewards around block 35000 !!!
We're talking Satoshi era coins here. Talk about a big chunk of bitcoin-day destroyed.
Someone from the UR-crowd is seriously putting their money where their mouth is.

1M per BTC in 10 years is not much imo
For these reasons:
    . if you zoom out to a 2-year scale, BTC is on an exponential tear
    . to quote: “The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.”
    . the USD is going to the shitter on a high-speed train.
The only thing that can bring BTC down is the advent of a radically better technology (and not just an incremental improvement like ETH, EOS and all the other shitcoins).
And even that won't bring BTC down: look at gold, and antiquated and obsolete currency if there ever was one (when compared to modern payment systems). It still holds value, and it still is a refuge for your wealth in times of turmoil.

From the video, the old fart says: "The asset is worthless because it is creating nothing".
This from the man who currently sits on 122 Billion in cash and cash-like assets.
Does fiat create anything?

Oh, also, and uness I misunderstood what you meant: making BTC infinitely divisible is most definitely not the same thing as an infinite supply.

Don't worry, I've done the math.
What I believe you are missing your calculation is the fact that all the mined satoshis are already owned. The remaining supply will be too (by miners, initially).
The amount of satoshis that will actually change hands is what matters. There won't be much of those in 10 years, especially when people realize that HOLDLing and selling only when you need to spend for your actual life needs is the only rational way to handle BTC.
Finally, since we're doing silly math:
    Max # of satoshis               World population        Max # of statoshis / person on the planet
          V                              V
    (21 000 000 * 100 000 000) / ( 8 000 000 000)        =  262 500 
Now for something a little bit more realistic, replace the 21 000 000 number by the actual amount of BTC that change hands in a year (or will in 10 years).

This question has been asked many times before ... at $2, at $30, at $120, at $1000, at $10k, at $20k.
The answer is always the same.

I had totally forgotten about Atlas. Made my day.
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:17:58
That's what he claimed. I would have said the same thing if I was him.

You guys want to reminisce about the old days?
Trigger warning, this might hurt...
I do remember the days when Gavin's faucet cranked out 5 BTC a pop and all you had to do was change your IP to get another 5 BTC (it wasn't worth the trouble back then).
I remember artforz, the first real hard core miner who for a while got close to 51% mining power with his own home-made GPU farm (I suspect he actually went above but managed to hide it to prevent a panic). Vanished into thin air after raking in a major chunk of coin. TL;DR: 2011 is when artforz *LEFT* Bitcoin, content with the coin he had made. If he held he's likely the king of some minor African country by now ... 
I remember knightmb , the dude who mined 370K+ BTC on his laptop in his bedroom and then disappeared ... 
I remember the mystery miner.
I remember the empty block scare.
I remember this thread:  
I remember this site: 
I remember that some of these addresses, hodlers with balls of titanium, have been accumulating coins since 2011:  without ever hardly spending a single satoshi.
There are  people who have been in Bitcoin a *very* long time and have remained 100% unphazed through the entire roller coaster ride, knowing deep in their guts from day one that the whole idea was a world changer and could not fail.
