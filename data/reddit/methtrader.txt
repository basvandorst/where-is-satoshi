I don't understand this. Can someone explain how a 12.5 Bitcoin reduction in supply is considered a significant supply shock? Or is it more of a psychological angle? The impact of Demand for bitcoins would weight significantly more heavy on the price than a 12.5 reduction in supply for each block. Where does my logic break down? Thanks.

OP posted something horribly stupid, but your post only further damages this community.

Careful not to use that word, you might get banned. Also, I'm long a good amount of Bitcoin too. If I could though I would short the fuck out of this community because it's a toxic plague here.

I dont know anything about 2-5, but they've already cashed out and secured funding for a few years already.
@_date: 2016-03-08 16:23:39
Because when the price was at $3-4 they said they had enough funding for a few years at those prices, and as you mentioned, they were going to cash out. Since then, the price rallied to $12.50 and has been sitting around $10 for several days now. That would imply MULTIPLE years of guaranteed funding. You really think they haven't cashed out yet? You think they would jeopardize the future of the project just to make a couple extra bucks? Given that that announcement was weeks ago, i think its 99% that they cashed out.

How is that different than all the developers working on Bitcoin? I don't know who made Bitcoin, or who's maintaining it, or who the Chinese miners are, or who's in charge of Core or Classic, or who's entrusted to handle the fork? What is the difference? (Disc: megalong both currencies)

Do you two mind (kindly) elaborating? Yes I am a supporter of ethereum, but I would really like to hear an opposing opinion. Isn't ethereum supposed to, you know, not really have as many issues? Thanks.

Awfully shortsighted of you. There was a time when Bitcoin had no economic use. Is it a stretch to imagine that one day more sophisticated forms of blockchain technology could be useful to the world? Do you think the use cases for blockchain tech BEGINS and ENDS with Bitcoin? Seriously?

Who cares that the founders of Counterparty were accused of a pump and dump by their own community director? Seriously?

If your blockchain is too bloated for your needs, why wouldn't someone else (not you, i can tell youre a Bitcoin guy) work on the blockchain that ISN'T as bloated. I'm not trying to plug eth. I'm trying to understand are there OTHER reasons why you would prefer to do it offchain (other than the technical limitations of your blockchain).
@_date: 2016-05-17 13:18:14
What does this have to do with TheDAO? Why does Bitcoin have to shit all over everything related to Ethereum? Why the hell can't crypto fans be happy about the proliferation of cryptos in general? What the fuck is wrong with everyone here?

- that's just something Vitalik says to prevent competition or fuel speculation
- they are obviously working on scaling, just like Bitcoin is. It's a work in progress, just like Bitcoin is
- I'm fairly certain that almost everyone views Blockstream/Adam Back as the dictator of Bitcoin today. 
- You're saying Ethereum's blockchain doesn't...work as well as the Bitcoin one? How so?
- Drugs? Seriously youre gonna point to illegal drug purchases as the price floor? Funny how this was your LONGEST bullet point as well. Drugs.
- Just like its not clear whether Bitcoin is going to incorporate Lightning network or not. Both currencies are works in progress.
- This strictly increases use cases by giving access to those who wish to do private transactions. Almost all of us will remain on the main public one.
- Only credible point you've made thus far. Yes Bitcoin has a network effect. If it's wasn't for that network effect and the religious following I believe Eth would be the top currency today. I hope you guys can hold on to the network effect as more and more powerful public figures start to throw their support towards Ethereum
Personally, I am also very very happy Bitcoin exists, and I love Bitcoin to death, I truly do. I just don't see it being the primary currency of the world in 20 years. Only time will tell who ends up being right.

Upvotes, likes, retweets, job offers, and funding do not make a man. All of those are trivial, and we all have examples of millions of people who have all those things, yet are not "good" people. You think anyone cares about your job offer? I wonder how much respect you think you command in the real world versus what you actually have.
I'll tell you what "going over well with people" means. It's about respect, human compassion, motivation to collaborate with others to help improve the world. Sure, youre trying to "improve" cryptos and help promote Bitcoin, but clearly your part in that broader agenda is to take down the competition (and fail at doing so might I add).
I'm not really sure if I've ever seen Gavin, Vitalik, Satoshi, Andreas, or ANY of the highly respected people in cryptoland ever shit on the competition as hard as you have. Do you think maybe that's why they have an insanely higher amount of respect than you?

Are they still taking a giant percentage fee of every transaction? Is it still as centralized as it was before, or did they fix those issues?

Is Bitcoin going to use smart contracts through Counterparty or Rootstock?  If it's Rootstock, did the transaction fee issue ever get resolved (as in, does rootstock still plan to take an exorbitant fee for all transactions passed through their side chain? /concernedtrollbutstillcurious

I have read his links in the past. There will be naysayers for every new technology ever to be developed, past present and future. 
EDIT: And you can read Vitalik's refutation in the comments
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:20:09
Sure, but you can imagine he's going to take a hell of a lot of people over to this next project, whether you like it or not. This article is full of FOMO bullshit garbage, but dont try to sit here and act like if Satoshi built something for Ethereum it wouldn't be a MASSIVE GARGANTUAN DEAL
@_date: 2016-05-14 03:14:01
What's to stop someone from forking their code and making a free side chain. What is rootstock bringing to the table (certainly not original code).

PLENTY of them benefit from being put on the blockchain. Trustless transactions greatly benefit many industries. And simply because something can also be done on the bitcoin blockchain, doesn't mean it can be done BETTER there. But to each his own I guess.

There's no need for condescending analysts in the tech space. He has been repeatedly wrong before in his views on how the crypto world will evolved. Consistently, and repeatedly wrong. How many times does an analyst get to be wrong before we stop listening to his ideas on what's going to happen.
To be clear, he is a very smart academic, but he seems to fail in the futurology department of what the world needs. And that's fine, plenty of people make wrong predictions. But it's his CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE that is so horrendous. The whole "THERE IS NO WAY ANYONE COULD EVER WANT ETHEREUM" blog posts. The elitist "I CAN NEVER BE WRONG BECAUSE I DID RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC."
Let's face it, N O   O N E  knows what the hell is going to happen in crypto land. For him to consistently act like he does (and be dead wrong about it), is ludicrous to me.
And I'm watching the videos, I got to the Ethereum and Slock.it part. It's just more of the same. He just keeps saying "NO ONE WILL EVER WANT OR USE THIS." Like, what the fuck dude. Maybe some people will? He needs to stop being so full of himself.
@_date: 2016-05-18 20:24:19
Why would it be good for the smart contract to go outside of the Bitcoin blockchain?

If sharding won't help on eth, why can't eth do it offchain (in the same manner that bitcoin is attempting to do it offchain?) Is there something special about bitcoin's that allows offchain transactions (that can't be done on eth)?

I'm on video 4 right now. Also, this is what Paul Sztorc had to say NOT EVEN SIX MONTHS AGO
- Ethereum is a running joke among Bitcoin experts. To the clearminded, it’s failure as an “investment” was always a foregone conclusion.
- When Vitalik proposed Ethereum, the technical elite of Bitcoin were so impressed that 0% of them decided to endorse/join the project (compare this to hardware wallets, colored coins, stealth addresses, sidechains, elements project [confidential transactions, tree signatures, RCLTV], lightning network, and my own project).
Why would I trust a statistician who has as much foresight as a fruit fly? Paul Sztorc is the guy who thinks he knows what other people want. The guy who goes around saying "This is how you should live your life, trust me, I know what's best, i went to yale." Well guess what, your condescending and snarky attitude isn't going over well with anyone.

Just for everyone's information, Counterparty's founders were accused of wrongdoings (pump and dump, misappropriation of funds) by their OWN community director, , who posted the minutes to one of the dev meetings a few weeks back. Thread apparently has since been deleted. The community should have the right to see those minutes again. Please post the link again (and explain why the thread was deleted).

No rush? In what sense is there no rush? As in, Bitcion will always and forever remain the best crypto and so they should take their sweet time in making it perfect? I wouldn't quite say that Bitcoin has any major threat or competition today, but the "no rush" attitude is what allows alts to make progress and close the gap.
@_date: 2016-05-06 16:48:20
It might be, it might not. It's too early to say. Maybe stable coins will rise. Who knows.

Where the hell did I say that "i dont know what the economic use cases are." I absolutely have IDEAS about what productive use cases are. Augur, Digix, and Slock.it are the premier ones right now. Real estate, politics, and financial transactions also come to mind. Censorship free social networks. Casinos. Stable Coins. If that's not enough for you, then I'm sorry Ethereum just isn't for you, and that's OK.

Huh ok. I wouldn't exactly call that a convincing argument but if that's truly how you feel who am I to argue. I was just curious about what your reasons were. To be honest, I'm done with this argument if you are, but if you wanted to continue I'd be interested in hearing which claims you think are not factual. That's the first time I've ever heard them accused of being deceptive in any manner. And I wouldn't say blockchain technology is meaningless but to each their own.
