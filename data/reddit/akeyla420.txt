That makes sense, I compared that list of private keys to my receiving addresses and found the ones that matched. I see how to send form specific addresses and which ones contain balances.  Backing up the private key for those makes sense, since it's not the giant list, easy enough to jot down.
The whole change thing came up reading about merge avoidance, something to practice on with small amounts first.

There's a slew of private keys listed in my wallet, I suspect I'd need to copy them all. That said looking at the keys fills in some of the blanks in my mind as I put together this puzzle. More to learn! Thanks.

I've been considering keeping my backup seed OTP encrypted. I can do OTP easily on paper, and have 'keys' for it memorized.  There is of course an inherent danger I'll forget my key, but I haven't yet for my other OTPs. Thanks for your great insigh!

Electrum source was downloaded and signature verified, for the online wallet. The offline one electrum comes as part of Tails, but I verified the Tails sig.
That Trezor looks interesting, going to read more on it. Thanks :)

Just wanted to thank everyone for their great information. I've read all the replies and and following the links and learning more.  Seemed like thanking everyone individually would spam the thread, and I'm still learning reddit etiquette. 
I definitely tried to do my reading before posting, I don't want to be the person out there saying 'spoon feed me please'.
Thanks again for all the help!
