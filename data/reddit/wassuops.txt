Wattier is smed
Clark is being extradited yep, just not there yet.

I sent in a picture of a man from online instead for privacy and they didn't except.

No smed/smedley was SR's technical/security guy, wanted to develop an SR wallet and all sorts. He is apparently cooperating with the Feds now, I assume against Clark.

Actually GPUs only mine in virtual world, not in real.

Yes, if you notice you are in the wrong way.

He tried all sorts, I think he even tried to subpoena his own account using a fake document. Guy was clearly nuts, but I think too stupid to steal from Gox. He got lucky on SR as he could lean on the whole criminal aspect.

VJ? I doubt it. Ever read about his escapades in the seed business?

Bridges was investigating Gox while also scamming from SR. However, it seems he wanted to cover his tracks there and did not attempt to steal from Gox. I'm sure he looked into it mind. Force also tried to meddle with Gox, but again to cover his own tracks on SR.

He's still in Thailand. Wattier is arrested and in the US now.

I believe VJ is POM personally, I am never sure whether people think they are the same or not. 
Re: the theory, it seems possible, but if he had such a thing I would imagine he'd have accepted extradition and took a plea deal in the US rather than fight extradition as I believe he is doing. He's a creative dude so I never quite believe his stories. 
I imagine he had the skill to hack Gox, for sure, since he could have hacked SR but decided to play a longer game. However, it just does not seem to be his bag. He seems to prefer being in the mix rather than just being rich.

No idea, I mean telling stories is kind of his thing and it worked for a long time in his prior life. I think SR was too big a step up from the seed world and now it is all coming to haunt him.
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:16:12
Are you suggesting VJ was involved with Gox?
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:18:42
For sure, he was basically running it solo. I believe Ver actually made him hire staff for basic things like responding to tickets. Also that he possibly did a lot of things by hand. In over his head IMO.

I've read a lot about the case and I think SR worked for them because of the cover they had via accounts. I don't think either was brazen enough to outright steal from Gox (but they would have if they could!). I tend to think Karpeles was just sucky at his job.
