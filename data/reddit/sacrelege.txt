Can someone explain to me how those mining pools are financed, if the pool fee is 0%?
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:49:59
Removed BTC and DOGE address, sorry about that.
@_date: 2016-03-02 23:58:30
So the full blocks we see currently are mainly cause of spammers?
Here is my transaction sent from bitfinex, it took over 1 hour till the first block if I remember correctly:
fees/bytes are about the same as yours (minimalistic bigger). But overall fees are lower (probably too low?). Not sure what counts. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 00:03:49
fair point. 1GB is probably not enough, I guess most nodes have more ram. (before the oom kicks in and kills the process or whatever happens)
The thing is, if there are more tx coming in, than can get removed from the mempool, its just a matter of time, till nodes are running out of ram. Shorter peaks of tx are okay and the bitcoin network obviously proofed it can handle it, which is fine.

After reading stuff like "0.05$ is still way cheaper than anything else, don't worry"... I have to post this:
Does anybody realize that the increase in transaction fee is strongly correlated to the increasing mempool/unconfirmed transaction, full blocks since weeks and all the posts here about transactions taking too long to confirm?
Check what was known already about a year ago:

ofc, he is heavily invested in bitcoin, highly depended on the bitcoin price... very biased imho. No additional information, no news, no nothing - just propaganda.

First of all thank you for supporting BTCfx.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this would need a very major change in the general App workflow. I'll keep your request in mind and think of any solution, but I can't promise anything right now. As you know, it displays the Bitcoin balance and wallets at the top of the screen, so I have to check for the correct permissions right after the start of the App. It is after all called a mobile trading client and half of the functions are related to an account - I hope you can understand it.

*lol* Your answer reminds on a scene from IT Crowd:

v0.4 beta 2013-07-14
- access key can now be manually entered (copy &amp; paste from mobile browser).
@_date: 2013-07-14 00:26:54
Version 0.3 Beta includes two bugfixes regarding the QR code scanner integration. It should fix your problem. Thanks for reporting. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 00:47:41
Hmm, you could try placing a few mirrors around your phone in the right angle.
Okay, I will look into this :)
@_date: 2013-07-14 19:24:08
I've uploaded version 0.4 beta right now. Should be available in a few hours:
- access key can now be manually entered (copy &amp; paste from mobile browser).
@_date: 2013-07-13 19:10:46
Nope, the yubikey is not needed when using an application access key. :)
@_date: 2013-07-14 11:53:23
- panic buy/sell request noted.
- version 0.31 contains some improvement, which should fix your crash problem.
Thanks for reporting.
@_date: 2013-07-13 15:11:54
You have to create an Application Access (key) with [trade] and [get_info] permissions, so the app can not withdraw any funds at all.
There is a tutorial with pictures, if you start the app the first time.
@_date: 2013-07-15 11:12:27
version 0.4.2 beta released:
- Support for gzip and different charset in the application access key activation process.
Sorry for your trouble and thank you for your patience on this - it is pretty hard to debug, since I can't reproduce the problem on my own. I hope this fix helps.

arg :-/
Could you provide me some more information, you can mail it to feedback AT btcfx.ch if you don't like to post it here.
- Language on the Phone
- Phone model &amp; Android version
- Do you use any proxy service?
- Do you use yubi key?
- Did you try using the mtgox mobile app and did it work?
Maybe you can think of anything other useful information, which might help to fix this.

It really shouldn't, this was confirmed by the guys in the  irc channel.
I've uploaded version 0.4 beta right now. Should be available in a few hours:
- access key can now be manually entered (copy &amp; paste from mobile browser).
@_date: 2013-07-13 17:02:02
Thank you very much. Although there is still a lot to do on the real thing, I'll consider your suggestion to provide some kind of a free trial version.
@_date: 2013-07-14 20:05:12
I've just released an other update regarding your problem.
version 0.4.1 beta
- In certain situation the scanned QR code seems to have an unnecessary prefix. This release can handle such keys too.
ps: usually it takes a few hours until the update is rolled out in the play store.
@_date: 2013-07-14 11:52:46

When the App crashes, android will rise a DialogBox on which you can choose to send the crash report. Could you please do that?
And thank you for supporting BTCfx, I will do my best to fix that.
@_date: 2013-07-13 19:35:27
Of course I did a lot of testing, but there are over 1300 different android devices out there and I can't test my App on every one of them. I expect a few bugs and until I'm sure it runs smoothly, it will remain in the BETA state.
I can use every function/feature from BTCfx on my phone on my account right now - so "yes" the App is complete. There is a good chance it will work on your phone fine too without any problems.
Yes, you have to buy it even in the BETA phase, not only because I already put a lot of effort into it, but also you will receive the updates for free and at a certain point in time, it will be no BETA any more. (If you wish I can consider to increase the price slightly after the BETA phase, to be fair to the BETA customers. ;))
Otherwise feel free to wait until the BETA phase is over - shouldn't take too long.
