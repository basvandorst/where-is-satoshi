Some believe they can conquer mortality by then. Something like a clone of your consciousness inheriting your bitcoin.

I'll just avoid CMC instead.

For sometime they have been averaging the exchange rates so with the skewed rise of KRW/BTC 23,000 vs 16,000 USD/BTC it has thrown off the actual value of everything. Without notice or communication they removed the KRW/ from being calculated. The lowered price averaging caused everything to drop instantly and a major panic sell off followed.

I had that idea! Glad someone put it in their game.
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:39:49
I suppose if enough people keep saying it enough it will become true, or at least the popular opinion to make it become true.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:29:25
Sorry if this has been asked before but I don't see this discussed. Beyond Segwit and LN, what else is on the horizon  or can be done to speed up the amount of transactions per second(compared to visa), exchanges being able to keep up with and exponential growth rate(more at the scale of coinbase coming?), and ease of entry for later adoptors that aren't crypto-savy? I'm completely fine with organic slower growth for bitcoin but I don't want to see it left to dust. I know nothing about what developments could be in the works that could speed  up and lower fees beyond LN and blocksize increase. Is there no other option?
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:07:19
There's no fee for withdrawing out of GDAX regardless what coin it is so it sounds like it would be better to stick with BTC in your case. One problem you may run into is with fees moving BTC again from Binance or risk loosing value trading for ETH to move out of Binance.
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:15:27
It would be even better if there was an option to choose weighted avg or the specific exchange market that you use.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:16:49
You can put LTC and XRP on a Ledger Nano S

It will recover back to 19k in 1-3 days

Bitpay announced they are going to accept it.

Exactly, even though not a lot of people have money in savings hundreds of millions are faced with debt and are backed into the corner were taking risks is the only smart way out of work wage enslavement.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:49:30
Since we've seen conservative estimates by 2018 of 10k reached but now looking closer to 20-25k, I'm getting a strange sense that some estimates of btc reaching 1m in a few years could be conservative too. Of course it greatly depends on tx/sec keeping up with adoption rate.

I wouldn't be surprised that csgo players are aware of bitcoin if they are into weapon skin trading.

Bot manipulation market ? On GDAX I see large walls dropping and disappearing to create a down trend.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:04:02
Did you not know that people really do use bots to automate trading? This is 2018 right?
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:58:08
What is more interesting is that the trading volume is double (2k vs 1k) back in November at a similar price. In other words a high upswing.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:22:41
didn't you know all estimates are highly accurate predictions of the future? lol

This is great. One thing I wish it had though was a lerp of all newsworthy predictions graphed out.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:25:09
For now LN gives BTC more regular publicity than being a rapid solution to scaling so it still helps give it some value. More than others later this year? Hard to say.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:19:01
. or ,  ?
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:17:11
I prefer the 95% BTC and 5% altcoin approach
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:26:03
Would you recommend hodling and forgetting / putting btc out of mind for a long time or always be ready to trade on major shifts?
Not jelly that you are in such a good position. Grateful, actually, that there are so many early believers in btc like you. I may not be involved in it otherwise.
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:52:30
eh.. I bought at $34800 and it dipped to $28000. So I bought a fraction more.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:31:33
At the same time, people to need to stop shaming and demonizing people for selling. Nobody know the future, everyone makes mistakes, and not everyone is in BTC to stay. The hate of non-hodlers is turning the community toxic and if that's how everyone is going, why be apart of it?
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:18:39
And always buy the dip

They had been $100-110 and a bit overpriced I think.

I don't think these posts are warning enough. Still too many people out there not being safe with their btc stash. It would be safer to send it to me to hodl, a random redditor, than to reveal the private key to any online source.
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:30:34
It's explained well enough that any intelligent tech-savvy person on wall street would be at least welling to test the btc market with a few million.
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:25:27
And it came with a monkey co-pilot? Great investment.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:42:37
to hell with it
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:30:23
Part of that is because very few people have that much in savings that they could deal with loosing or risking for long term.

Think he put in his 24mil 10% in just before the hearing?
edit: He probably had put some in even pre-November
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:24:38
Doesn't that depend on it's value though? If it's $100/BTG then probably not worth converting it.

That's like assuming you could make an MMORPG that would dethrone World of Warcraft from 2007-2014. Turned out it's not possible.
