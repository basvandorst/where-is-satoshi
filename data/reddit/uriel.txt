Everything is so screwed up because the govt is incompetent, congress is made up of politicians, and the people are morons.
No need for conspiracy theories.

This is almost as useless as the airport security circus, it does little more than make  you feel a bit better, but it provides very little to no real security.

Its got nothing to do with perfection, but with false vs. real sense of security. Pretty much none of the the thefts of BTC so far would have been prevented by this, and plenty of people would have been even more careless because their wallet is encrypted so it must be secure!

Providing a false sense of security *is* making things worse.
