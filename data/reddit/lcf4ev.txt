I was well above 100 and I landed well enough, but I wish I did it earlier of course as I have debated with myself for weeks now. 
2017 is not looking good for btc, and before we have solved long term scaling, usable fees bitcoin has not much of a future
Great leadership is needed in one way or another!

Leadership is what Bitcoin needs more than anything right now.
I dont support BU, but this move I think is a great attempt going forward. 
This will be BUs strenght in the media debate. Btc has no leader and it will look weak, while Btu stand there with a leader
Btc should at least have a public board of directors or such.
What group of people have ever reached greatness without leadership

Agree 'miners mine what has value', but I don't see why miners in the future will not end up having their own Core/BU team of devs. They will then control 'what has value'. 
It will end up like European politics. No party has the majority of votes alone, but the parties who work together can control what the doers/devs shall do/be accepted. 
The organic rules of capitalism will win - that is to maximise fee volum (not meaning fees as high as possible). To do this the 'fee people / miners' will seek as much control as possible

Show me a successful decentralized product or service.

Really glad you came forward. I have been looking for that bad luck dude behind all of this!

The war between Core vs Unlimited is killing the price. 
Exchanges stated today they are prepared for a split in Bitcoin.

technically yes, same thing tradingwise. Little more risky if the guys behind goes bankrupt

It indirectly impact the majority so yes in the end it can. Miners 'stoped' SW which affect the software users run. Or choose BU it goes the same way. 
Down the road miners will have a lot mote power, or the power. Who owns hash power owns what users run. 
The ultimate goal of miners is to control and maximise fee profit (that does not mean as high as possible).

Infrastructure can be decentralized, bandwidth, roads, phone lines, electricity cables etc. It works as they use more or less the same tech and materials. It becomes fragmented, but still works. 
Road, phone, electricity etc services does not work when decentralized - they need leadership which gives stability in the forseen future. 
Crypto will continue to be decentralized, but the winner will not be. Leadership does not mean one person. 
Please tell me if you have any examples that prove me wrong!

This will be blody - core/bu is killing it. From a tech and community perspective. Until solved I dont really believe in bitcoin that much anymore.

It is trending in that direction but nobody knows
If ulimited is gets passed 50% it could happen at any moment (they could also do it now, but not wise without greater support)... But most likely around 75% - they need more miners to support them.
