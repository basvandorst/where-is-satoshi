Didn’t he speculate it would be 10 million if it had all the worlds wealth?

For simplicity sake, let’s say my salary is a dollar and I pay 20% tax.  So I have $0.80 to spend.  Let’s say I spend it all, now you’ve made $0.80 less the cost of good but for arguments sake let’s say it was a service and you had 0 cost,  Well after tax you have $0.64.  Repeat a few more times and that dollar is just gone.

I don’t disagree, but the statement was so matter of fact I thought I might shed some reason.

You can’t hide it.  But you can put it there and hope nobody is paying attention..

A solution depending on a centralized actor (whomever is hosting the call) is not a solution to the byzantine generals problem.  A hypothetical conference call which is already fault tolerant, could be used to solve the byzantine generals problem.  But that’s a recursive solution.

I hate to break it to you, “General”, but a conference call wouldn’t help with byzantine fault tolerance.
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:44:43
It’s a poor analogy for starters.  Who’s running this conference call?  If it’s a conference call backed by a distributed system, then this is a chicken before the egg scenario; you’ll have needed to solve the byzantine generals problems before you can use this hypothetical conference call solution.. to the byzantine generals problem.
If instead it’s a centralized service backing the call for example, they would simply need one actor to give conflicting information like retreat to one general, and attack to another.  Being on this call, you would have no way to know of the conflict - hence the problem.

Computers don’t make it any easier to get around the byzantine generals problem..
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:57:45
It’s for generals too, not just computers.

I’m pretty sure telegram allows you to paste text that isn’t formatted.  Usually 3 back ticks to start and 3 to finish and anything between is sent unformatted

Conversely, they can sell at 12000USD and it just keeps going up.

Out if all the altcoins, ETH is without question the best bet.  That said, it makes sense to ALWAYS hold BTC.

In the beginning, Each block “minted” 50 bitcoins.  None of satoshi’s addresses have more than 50 btc in them (unless people tipped/donated to the address).
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:49:04
You wouldnt be able to mine any blocks.  The hash of each block is also linked to the address receiving the block reward.  You would be able to use the price data to accurately time the market though.

Does anyone else think that confirmation bias is responsible for the majority of mental gymnastics that occurs in the world?
@_date: 2019-05-29 07:07:06
Because, as a time traveler they were looking back at historical prices.  In the future the blip of 2017 is so small that it’s hard to tell.  Logarithmic charts etc

Gradually.  If his eyes hurt, it’s because he’s never used them before.
