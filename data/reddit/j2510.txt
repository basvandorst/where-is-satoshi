I was just going to post this... OP, how exactly does HoustonBits work?
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:01:31
I don't think so, no. Partially because silver/gold are depreciating currencies that also exist without the internet. Bitcoin has its advantage in transaction power, and gold/silver have an advantage that they physically exist without anything else needed.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:48:19
lol you mean $0.60
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:46:14
Problem solved.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:27:09
Glad you found your BTC. I'd be happy with double digit BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:41:44
This makes more sense. If it was legal tender, this would be HUGE news. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:02:15
I might also add that the "learning curve" for bitcoin is much steeper than for silver/gold.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:49:08
Don't be that guy
@_date: 2013-06-01 00:30:05

@_date: 2013-04-07 20:42:57
I would, but [warning: noob comment coming] I used coinbase to buy/sell and now they have that weird daily limit thing, which they didn't have when I first got in. I tried to go ahead and buy, but it won't let me. Any advice?

It's nice to hear some positive reports now and again.
@_date: 2013-05-02 03:18:58
lol, nice chart. you should probably sell all your BTC to me for $40 a pop. It's the mean, right?
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:59:34
I'll keep buying gradually... A little with each paycheck. Maybe one day I can pay my mortgage directly with bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:42:09
Little by little, build up those coins
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:22:06
quit forking around, this is serious.
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:12:05
Holy shit, &lt;$30? Can't wait for that so I can buy shittons of BTC
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:29:27
I like your point about knowledge/awareness. I live in a city where NO ONE knows about bitcoin. I have traded stocks and made a few friends that do, too, but they don't know about bitcoin. One of my friends has heard about it, but didn't have a clue as to what it actually was.
@_date: 2013-06-05 17:43:45

So what does one month cost in BTC today?
@_date: 2013-05-21 01:45:58
If I had 100 BTC suddenly bestowed upon me without using my own money, I would run around reddit tipping people to raise bitcoin awareness. I would do it in something like .2 BTC amounts so that I could tip 500 people roughly 25 USD each. I think that amount would be enough for them to investigate and join the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-05-12 17:20:40
Is anyone else concerned about the paragraph titled "Real Investors are starting to take bitcoin seriously"? Rather than having "real investors" park a bunch of wealth in bitcoin, wouldn't bitcoin benefit from actual use/purchases via bitcoin? 
I'm just worried bitcoin is seen as a speculative "stock" rather than a currency with which to buy things.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:51:07
Honestly, I still think people like you and I are early enough to the game to really see it take hold and become a widely used currency.

I can't imagine just suddenly having 20 BTC. I've barely got over 3
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:14:22
Give it enough time and it'll be true. If the government keeps buying its own debt (bonds) at 85$ billion per month, it'll happen.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:44:04
I think you have to put BTC after the .5
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:25:50
Happy Cakeday! I've encountered you twice and found you to be very pleasant both times.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:58:30
I am.
Look, If I buy 5 bitcoins, I spend roughly $1000. If bitcoins drop to 0, yea, it will suck, but my life won't change at all. Plus I can claim the loss on my taxes.
However, if it succeeds... If I own 5/11,000,000 of the wealth in the system --- can you imagine?
@_date: 2013-11-02 02:38:00
1₥ BTC would be roughly 20 cents right now. I've been trying to convince friends to invest in bitcoin, but they always see the $200 price and get scared. Perhaps if we used ₥BTC, I could say "think how many ₥BTC you can buy right now! They're only 20 cents each!"
There's definitely a psychological block with the full bitcoin price.

That's true; I see your point. No one really buys things with gold today, but it's still a good store of value.

It's just lag, check again in a few hours. Also check the history tab under transactions.

I agree more with your metaphor than mine.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:53:39
Yes. I honestly don't understand how they can charge you for holding your money - which they then lend out and rake in interest from.
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:55:41
Yet another advantage of bitcoin over fiat. 
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:53:46
Obviously this means you should panic sell
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:14:57
If it every gets to that point, measuring bitcoins in USD would be meaningless.

Personally, I'd like to see a list of reputable online AND local stores (perhaps by searching zip) that accept BTC. I'd also like to see which of these stores actually deals in BTC, and which cash out to USD immediately using an exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:12:17
Banks make money by loaning out your money - that is their revenue. All the services you listed have no similar revenue, and therefore must charge account fees.
Also, go ask Cypriots if they were able to get their money out of their bank. IIRC, some depositors took a 47% hair cut. 
Your analogy doesn't work. Thanks for playing.
