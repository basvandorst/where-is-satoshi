Top of my list for the best multi currency wallet for your cryptocurrency is the hugely popular Trezor Hardware Wallet. This multi-currency crypto wallet provides a very high level of security while still being extremely easy to use.
Trezor was the first Bitcoin wallet launched back in 2014 and offers users “cold storage” of multiple crypto assets together with the ability to spend your coins with the convenience of a hot wallet.
The Trezor Wallet is tiny at only 2.4 x 1.2 x 0.2 inches and weighs a mere 0.42 oz. It easily connects to your computer by a USB port.
The Trezor is so safe because it is an “isolated environment” used for offline transactions and it’s fitted with a small display screen so that to you can visually verify your transactions. (In fact, spending Bitcoins is secure even when using a compromised computer!)
The Trezor can be seen as “safe” for your crypto wealth and currently supports the following Bitcoin, Ethereum (+ all ERC-20 tokens), Ethereum Classic, ZCash, Litecoin, Namecoin, Dogecoin, Dash and Bitcoin Testnet.
The Trezor works by keeping private keys on the device and it authorizes transactions through your USB port. To use the Trezor, you will also need to download an app such as Mycelium and then you will be able to move your money around with ease.
The Trezor is compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, &amp; Android and is my choice for the best multi-currency wallet available today.
