You can also have bitinstant send coins straight to a bitcoin address

There are several already:

More than likely they do it by deposit amount. I wanted to deposit an even number, and bitfloor told me to deposit that number plus some change

@_date: 2012-08-10 12:44:58
That is the expected behavior
@_date: 2012-08-10 12:48:27
It certainly works. It just works in an unexpected way

It would more likely be the DoJ or secret service

sounds a bit like [freenet](
@_date: 2012-08-10 13:10:47
I think thats what got me. There is no change amount field on brainwallet.org, and i assumed the change would go back to the sending address

Its called diffie-helman. Its not public/private encryption, its a key exchange method to agree on a shared key for use in symmetric encryption.
Cool video!

Say that Alice wants to send Bob a message. If Alice and Bob are using symmetric crypto, they both know a shared secret, often called a secret key. Alice encrypts the message with the secret key and sends it to Bob. Bob decrypts the message with the secret key and reads it. Examples of symmetric crypto include AES, DES, and Blowfish (to name a few).
Asymmetric crypto works a little differently. Bob generates a keypair: a public key and a private key. He keeps the private key secret and safe. Anyone can see the public key; he can publish it on his website, email it around, whatever. The keypair have the property that a message encrypted with one key can only be decrypted by the other. Now, when Alice wants to send Bob a message, she encrypts it with his public key and sends the encrypted message to Bob. Bob recieves the message and decrypts it with his private key. Examples include RSA and ECC. 
One hard problem with symmetric crypto is key distribution. Alice doesnt want to just email Bob a key, because if someone intercepts it, they can read further encrypted messages. This video is about a protocol called Diffie-Helman that allows Alice and Bob to agree on a symmetric key without it ever being sent over the wire.
Asymmetric crypto gets around the key distribution problem, but is usually WAY more intensive to do computationally. One way to deal with this is to use Asymmetric crypto to exchange a symmetric key (in fact, this is what SSL does).

Yep. I was wrong.

put your wallet in a truecrypt container. decrypt when you need it, keep it encrypted when you dont. done.

Programmer here. 
What value would you bring to the team? It sounds like my contribution would be building the product or service. In exchange for that I would (as you said) maybe get shares of the venture, and eventual payment. 
What's your contribution? And don't say "I'm an idea guy". EVERYONE is an idea guy

I don't think so. The reward doesn't get cut Han in half forever. It's always a whole number of coins. The last reward to be generated will have the 21 millionth bitcoin. After that, miners make money from transaction fees

Yeah, I thought the story was going to be "I sent my gf some btc, then she went on localbitcoins on her phone or something and found someone to sell them to"

I have a lot of experience hosting various things on AWS (EC2, S3, etc). I wonder if there is a market for subletting EC2 space in exchange for btc?

Complicated is bad.
You now have 4 valuables to defend. Two of them can be compromised, but they can't be the wrong 2, so you have at least 2 sets of secrets (say, A and the c-&gt;A transaction) that you REALLY have to protect.
How about this instead: memorize a phrase. Throw in some numbers or punctuation if you like. Then run it through sha-256 n number of times. The result is the private key for your brand new treasure chest. It can be generated offline, and never has to touch persistent storage (or paper). Now the only things you have to protect are your memory of the phrase and the number n.

yeah I trade on bitfloor. WAY less friction than mt.gox

I bought at 10, so I still made a profit, but I was just shocked today.
I honestly thought the market would stabilize around $13
