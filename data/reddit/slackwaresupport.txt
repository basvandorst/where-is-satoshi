can 1 single person or small group move all btc to their own?  no. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 13:52:43
you need to add 2 0s to that number to do anything
@_date: 2018-09-15 07:37:25
you can send destroyed moneys in to the reserve and they will replace what they can peace back together and verify.

@_date: 2018-05-10 15:27:16
you mean, you dont control.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:59:04
man some people just have no clue.
@_date: 2014-08-18 12:30:34
over where?  you realize bitcoin is worldwide.. not just the US
@_date: 2014-10-28 19:47:10
why?  as someone who used to take credit cards for a business.  mastercard sucks!  well all of em do really.  all those "extras" they give customers.. ya thats charged back to the businesses they used the card at.  so all those extra points, travel miles, etc.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:04:01
looks terrible.. send it to me, ill fix it. ;)
@_date: 2014-05-24 02:26:46
i agree
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:11:50
not all emails require a reply.
@_date: 2014-09-23 05:33:59
tomorrow.. but i could be wrong.
@_date: 2014-11-22 00:55:56
you have to insert it in your anus, sideways.
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:54:49
    all the more reason to use it.
@_date: 2014-09-13 00:02:00
ya ok.. we believe you him..
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:14:53
but.. if they go into it.. would it be almost guaranteed to succeed? 
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:37:59
huh.. and who would trust this??  100 % promise to send bitcoin in 10 minutes.. lol  and in China
@_date: 2014-12-01 03:22:50
had something similar.  out 2k on 5 auctions.  
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:01:41
download the bootstrap first.. 
@_date: 2014-09-03 14:06:44
yes, but it will probably happen, more people than bankers and politicians.. ;)
@_date: 2014-06-23 14:54:40
right on.. or do it at the IRS office.. lol.. i also doubt you will find someone willing to take a 10% hit.. donno.. maybe.. but the fees online or way less i believe, coinbase i think is 2 something %
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:02:01
so you try to solicit a referral?
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:22:33
years ago
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:14:41
1. never say never. 2. it was already there once.
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:52:20
its already worldwide accepted.. just not every business.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:11:06
i can get linux and mac
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:06:56
ok. now its there.. i swear i did it 3 times.
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:16:16
big companies are getting behind it. paypal has even said they are going to start accepting bitcoins.
edit:  theres no doubt electronic currency will be the future.
@_date: 2014-06-23 14:58:11
i doubt anyone is going to give up 10%.. thats 1000 bucks.
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:59:26
im not paying everytime i send an email bro. but i do understand what you are trying to accomplish.
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:07:20
no.. it hasnt been updated. but its better than starting from the begining.. the bootstrap is 20gig.. you HAVE to all transactions.. you cant just start syncing today.
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:42:50
elsewhere.. ie:  bitcoin, cash only, put their own atms in their businesses.. etc...
@_date: 2014-09-02 19:33:46
bwhahahahahahahaha.. here let me give u my address.. guys.. ill take 500k..
@_date: 2014-04-21 18:01:52
@_date: 2014-08-23 18:41:15
it is because everyone still isnt seeing BTC as a currency, but a means to get the currency they want.
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:40:12
you are not going to make 35.09 a day with that.  1TH/s makes around that at the current difficulty
@_date: 2014-07-03 18:52:56
the world needs a currency that can not be controlled.. the current monetary system fucking sucks, or should i say the ponzi scheme
@_date: 2014-08-05 18:04:36
good luck.. gonna be 10 years.
@_date: 2014-05-28 21:41:10
i have 5 s1's i love em. and now with their new unit out.. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:49:56
some will.  most small businesses cant afford the rates now.. mastercard is the worse.  all those "deals" they offer, like double miles, double points, free shit, ya that isnt free its charged back to businesses ..
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:37:30
paypal isnt a bank.. it is a processing company.. it processes payments.
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:58:24
whats the meaning to life?
@_date: 2014-05-28 16:04:50
and?  it is still a record of your name, address, btc address that the IRS/gov can get.  one of the main advantages to bitcoin is being anonymous
@_date: 2014-09-03 12:57:13
the monetary system will go away.. it has to.  who wants something that can be inflated to oblivion?  bitcoin is instant, and, no government, corporation, or person can levy your funds, that is the best part.  the world wants bitcoin, only people who dont, bankers and politicians.. you cant hide bitcoins like money.. ;)
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:38:40
no.  but you do realize.. btc is public.. you can see your btc in their wallet.
@_date: 2014-05-24 02:02:44
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:45:30
and you will be crying in a week.
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:21:34
no they wont.  they want a direct link as does paypal.. that way if someone commits fraud, and paypal reverses the fee.. its not on coinbase.
@_date: 2014-06-04 20:38:56
 thats only 12,600.. you will not be a millionaire on 21 BTC
@_date: 2014-09-11 16:49:05
didnt mean that as you did bro.. sorry..
@_date: 2014-04-15 17:32:22
too damn high.. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 19:18:41
and its gone.
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:51:26
april.. what?
@_date: 2014-09-11 14:34:06
what they are REALLY SAYING IS. they cant control your money, they cant be in business.  they cant let governments or companies take your money without your say if you use bitcoin.. thats what they are saying.
@_date: 2014-05-28 22:29:38
where are you mining at?
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:05:49
you need to understand bitcoin more.
@_date: 2014-06-23 21:42:43
get a wallet.. create a key to receive.. take it to here:
post qr code generated
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:34:52
yes.  always, but that will only push a business to look elsewhere. more likely rates go down.
@_date: 2014-06-14 04:01:16
decrease.. flooding the market.
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:45:45
true story
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:06:49
coinbase, gyft you can buy gift cards with it.. i buy stuff on amazon, hulu, etc
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:06:24
i did.. it only offers credit card or paypal
@_date: 2014-09-01 12:35:55
lmao!  anyone can insert messages
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:44:23
then dont deal in any hard currency.. stick to BTC or digital form.. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:27:25
actually it does.. bitminer s1's.  they are .893 BTC at time of me writing this. and 1 BTC is about 450ish.. well under 500 bucks for 200GH/s
@_date: 2014-09-11 14:30:01
soo.. theres no fraud risk in the monetary system? lets think about that.. with bitcoin.. you can cut out, fake bills or any fake money.. etc etc etc
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:10:38
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:32:53
personally.. i don't care.  just as long as my mind keeps up with the ratio.  who cares.  you buy gum now that is .01 or pennies..
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:22:32
yes, which means...... duh.. do you think if they were not, they would even say anything, or say "PayPal has looked into bitcoin, and we do not think we will be doing anything at this time"
@_date: 2014-05-24 18:28:23
there is no answer to this.  thats like saying, how much money is a lot.  if you are a millionaire, 1000.00 isnt that much, but if you only have 10.00 in the bank, 100.00 looks damn good.
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:17:02
just core?? the bootstrap is the core.. every transaction has to be verified
@_date: 2014-08-11 16:10:22
close. the super computer that computed that dropped a digit off.. the meaning to life is   420
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:12:54
the best way would be an accepted list.  just like :
if you havent sent an email to a person before you get a link back to click to make sure you are real, and also the person can whitelist any, etc.
@_date: 2014-05-28 22:33:25
ya the pool.. i am too.. and on the reddit team..
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:19:44
hellz ya!  please tell us how it is.. im thinking about upgrading myself.. i have an orion 6inch atm.. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:01:51
it is both never, and always.
Schrödinger's cat 
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:35:42
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:45:03
yes. theres always delay until the next block is found usually 10 minutes.  if you sent without fee.. its probably lost forever.  maybe.  you have the transaction. look it up
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:41:11
print them and give to them just like a savings bond.  they can import to a wallet later.. but.. todlers? BTC may not even be around .
@_date: 2014-05-28 15:48:50
hah.. yeah.. already building the database of who owns what keys.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:24:58
hah.. F U IRS
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:59:12
lol...  its amazing how the rats will run and try to upgrade shit when something better finally comes along.. when they could have done this 10-15 years ago
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:49:04
"Lack of Understanding"  well.. no shit Sherlock.  its NEW. computers had a lack of understanding back in the day also.  and you see how that went.
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:28:30
they could convert to other assets, gold, property, etc.
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:47:44
seems scammy to me
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:22:46
if they bought gold, houses, cars, OTHER assets than cash.. you can buy things with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:29:45
there again.. coinbase probably doesnt want a 3rd party in between your money, you, and them.
@_date: 2017-02-13 03:41:11
heh.. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:08:11
far as i see.. its just been down.. down.. down.. from 1k. ;)
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:35:47
how the hell would you know?
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:30:43
sure did.. and thats when everyone bought.  lets see it get up over and stay.
@_date: 2015-01-09 13:30:16
lol.. it cant even break 400 
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:19:35
put it this way. there are still commercials on buying gold and gold coins..
@_date: 2016-01-06 01:42:32
No iOS is bsd based.
@_date: 2016-03-10 19:35:00
send me some bro.. just a million will be fine.
@_date: 2015-01-19 15:14:09
dont forget the social security scam.  its part of that too.  and.. the federal reserve is privately owned.  lol.. what happened when Bernie Madeoff did that?
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:28:52
you are assuming someone wants to convert.  there are people who want to collect coins atm.  
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:53:25
ya. i dont even use the desktop. i use a mac. but im a linux admin for profession.  
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:31:44
meaning.. people have been buying gold for how long? and they are still saying this is the year for gold.. etc.. going up..
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:04:49
nice. ya they were getting bloated for sure.  i always used blackbox or fluxbox
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:44:40
i think i remember this post last year this time.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:46:41
yep.  although.. linux has now won. lol
@_date: 2019-03-17 07:23:48
i sure hope so.
@_date: 2016-06-04 20:53:49
whatever you are willing to pay
@_date: 2016-06-04 20:32:17
buy locally from other people. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 18:15:29
usually it goes to the bitcoin address page. and gives you like a couple hours or so to send.  make sure you are picking bitcoin payment
@_date: 2016-06-04 20:36:30
meet in public place?  and you transfer immediately. 
@_date: 2016-06-05 21:01:27
hah.. say good bye to em
@_date: 2016-06-04 21:53:37
buy them. obviously.  
@_date: 2017-01-29 18:51:42
huh.. am i correct in thinking that bitcoins are not stored directly on the damn atm?
@_date: 2019-11-12 17:19:26
coin lending most likely.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:57:22
because there is a demand for it.  just like hamburger meat.  there is a demand, so it has a value.
@_date: 2017-08-27 04:26:32
i would suggest hardware, not software. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:41:34
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:57:05
you can look that up.  
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:38:37
you can buy others directly.  
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:42:33

@_date: 2018-11-30 02:13:49
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:02:54
possible.  did you have a coinbase account?
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:47:28
no thats religion.  same as here 
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:57:27
unless you named it something else.
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:55:30
well, you can rule out ones in like /windows/system etc.  it is going to be in your docs or home dir etc..
@_date: 2019-01-03 21:27:52
did you have a wallet of your own or a website with a wallet?  if on your own, search your machine for wallet.dat, or *.dat maybe.
