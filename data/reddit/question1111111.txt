When using the Multibit desktop app or the Blockchain.info phone wallet is my IP address or BTC address revealed simply by being online and seeing my balances? I'm using these two wallets as my "hot" online wallets for everyday spending and I have some questions about how they work.
Question  When I open my Multibit or Blockchain app and the wallet displays the balance of my BTC addresses, what information is leaking from my computer? The whole point of the Multibit desktop app and the Blockchain.info phone app is that I don't have to download the 25 GB blockchain but by communicating with a server hosting the full blockchain what information is my computer transmitting? Do these wallets request the balance on my specific addresses only or do they query the balance of all BTC addresses and only show me mine? If it is just my address in the request doesn't this communication reveal that my IP address is specifically interested in only those BTC addresses? If so, can't "onlookers" assume that the queried address are coins I own. Is this a problematic privacy issue? Or is this communication encrypted in someway so that my balance inquiry does not give away anything? I'm guessing the owner of the server keeps a log of the requests with my IP address, right? Can eavesdroppers or my ISP etc. also see this information while it is being transmitted?
Question  When sending BTC from Multibit or Blockchain (or any other wallet app for that matter) is my computer's IP address tied in anyway to the transaction or does it just look like my IP address is a node pushing the transaction along to other nodes? Is my IP recorded in the bitcoin blockchain? Is it recorded in logs anywhere? Can I configure Multibit to only communicate through TOR or is it already private in someway?
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
