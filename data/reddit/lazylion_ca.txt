I happen to share your paranoia. While my federal government requires such businesses to verify their customers, the reality is, I don't have any way of verifying the business.
Who am I giving my information to? What are they going to do with it? How secure is their setup? What if they get hacked and my picture and ID get stolen. What if the future owners of the company are less scrupulous? What's to stop them from using my picture and my ID to buy btc on other sites? Or engage in other nefarious activities?
What if a future version of my government goes full nazi and decides to imprison everybody who ever bought bitcoin?   
Ok, that last one is a bit of stretch, but for me, one of the biggest reasons to use bitcoin is to have the same anonymity as cash when doing transactions. Paypal and Interac transfers are great but they leave a 'paper-trail' that I'm just not cool with.
@_date: 2016-04-18 08:01:02
Them 'drug smugglers and terrorists' can also set up their btc vendor website and harvest people's photos, ID, and personal information.

Good to know. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 12:12:36
But is my bank sharing that information?
@_date: 2015-06-04 13:37:23
And I understand the reasoning for that. In the event of a fire that kills people, they need a way to identify the body. 
Yes, they also use it for credit card verification. 
Many bars now also scan your ID just to let you in the building. 
At least in these cases, I have reasonable idea of who I gave my ID to, and a reasonable understanding of what it will be used for; historically speaking, nothing has come of it. 
These crypto vendors on the other hand don't just want my ID, they want a picture of me holding my ID, and I have no idea who they are. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:07:09
I'm curious just how much detail they have access to.  I doubt they get enough to do identity theft with. 
Course I avoid those machines like the plague because they charge too much. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:23:41
The bank I deal with, yes. The private ATM company running the cash machine in the 7/11 does not.
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:58:55
Getting a pic of me in a parka, touque, and sunglasses is different than having my passport or drivers.  
@_date: 2015-06-04 06:24:14
That doesn't mean the vendor or the credit processor gets it.  I don't remember any instance of a restaurant being given my drivers license number, let alone a high resolution picture of it, just because I paid for a burger and fries via interac. 
FYI, I didn't have a passport when I opened my current bank account, so my bank doesn't have that. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 01:59:53


Yes. I outlined the sequence of event. I was unwilling to show my ID so I just walked away. Never saw option to select an amount or method payment.


I think it has more to do with preventing credit card fraud ie: I can't buy bitcoin then claim I didn't and reverse the charges. Bitcoin transactions are not reversible so there is a very real risk of the vendor getting screwed. I still don't like it, but sadly I foresee this happening a lot more in the future and not just with crypto-currency.


Not just this instance. Every site I've signed up for hits you up for your ID AFTER getting all your other details. If I had been aware of this requirement, I would not have bothered with so much as filling in my name.
@_date: 2015-06-04 06:19:29
Why do I need an account at all?
I deposit cash and give it my wallet ID. 
Same as a person to person transaction. 
I understand that if I use my debit or credit card that some information may be accessible but that is true of any vendor, but not my government id.

This. I expect they printed a hundred of these hoping to nab suckers. 
I doubt they would track where the payment came from.

So if I understand this correctly, this involves have my wallet on my computer. 
Which means I have to have my computer and ensure it is secured, not only against being stolen, but being accessed by anyone else. 
This also assumes that I will only use my own computers which isnt always the case. I might use the wifes computer or the bosses computer or any particular work station that happens to be handy.

I don't know these people. I don't know who is running these websites. Yet I'm expected to just give them my ID?

No. The point are awarded to the players for their actions much the same as money is awarded to people for their labor.
The source of the points is irrelevant as is the outcome of the game, whereas the outcome of our labour can be very important and thus the compensation should be commiserate and tangible.

As per your blog, it is a preventative measure.
You and I and the cops all know that Mr. Whiskey is going to get in his car drunk and drive away, but without this law, the cops can't actually do anything UNTIL he starts driving, at which point they can then give chase and hope nothing bad happens, like paperwork or, ya know, a crash.
When people complain "The cops were there, why didn't they stop him from driving in the first place?" Well, under what authority could they have stopped him without this kind of law?

I think that money laundering laws came into being because specific people were do so for specific reasons.
Who the hell would launder money unless they had gotten it illegally?
But now we have paypal and bitcoin and the average person can earn, harbor, and spend money without their governments knowledge. 
According to tax laws, this money should count as income and be taxable. But if it is never turned into 'official currency' then there is no way currently to track it.
But the government still considers this illegal, and you want to make people aware of this.

Back when I was working as a contractor, I was writing everything off so as not to pay taxes. Unfortunately, when it came time to get a mortgage, I couldn't show any income. I ended up having to re-file 2 years of taxes and spend three more years paying it off.
@_date: 2013-09-02 07:15:43
Sure. I did another thread later on stating that I have gotten my first payment, and have since gotten my second.  I believe my third is due this week. 
The first was a week late, but they were up front about it. They send out regular newsletters (email) that are not just marketing hype. 
They have had the same issues with getting hardware that everybody has had, and they have openly admitted this, but have strived to stay on schedule. 
I bought two indefinite contracts while they were still available. Their one year contracts seem like less of a good deal to me. 
I expect to make my money back within a year, depending on bitcoins value of course.  I am treating it as a long term investment, not a get rich quick scheme. 
I might not have the most hashes which is what everyone seems worried about, but I don't have to worry about hardware or power bills or cooling, etc.
So far I am content. 
Also keep an eye on r/litecoin

As a tech, I often have to explain to my co-workers how to do something, or give an estimate as to how long will it take to do it.
  
I have learned to emphasize the difference between "easy" and "straightforward".
"Easy" means there are three steps, bang bang bang and done.
"Not Easy" means there are 99 steps and will take you all day, but the job is straightforward. Follow the steps and you shouldn't have any problem. Two people working together may speed things up.
"Not Straightforward" means that the steps have to be done in pain-staking order, and if this happens, do this, if that happens, don't do this, and these steps have to be done correctly BEFORE you move on to that.
