Let me clarify, it's not my article but the one I posted here and the way things are presented there are a bit confusing and misleading if one compares with Ukrainian media news website (which might be not completely true too, I admit and I don't trust the media ). 
So in another media source it says that the head of the village community invested his own money in crypto some time ago and made x3. 2/3d of which he gave out to his fellow villagers, it was Bitcoin and two or three more insignificant crypto. 
But the initiative was that one of authorities and yes, you might be right that they lied about giving away the crypto to people. 
Still it's a way of spreading the word among people to popularize Bitcoin.  
Here is the link to that another Ukrainian article

Who says about perfect? The title says "almost invulnerable". Never is going to be perfect. It's a course of life we follow and it's always changing, that is one of the main reasons why consitutions and states cannot work and why I am an anarchist. We always need to find a consensus - a constantly changing process, like Evolution.

@_date: 2018-08-13 09:21:44

Trading on an exchange is a not an everyday need of the mass market but a speculator's need to make a buck. Are you the one? If so, then wait for 6 confirmations and exchanges fees. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 22:36:33
What? This is ridiculous! You must be very far from knowing that confirmations take average 10-15 minutes and that the transaction fee can be as much as $0.02 as of now and this is my personal true experience. 
Use Coinomi wallet and experience for yourself. 
Besides you must probably know nothing about Lightning Network as system allowing Bitcoin to scale and remove the need to wait for 15 minutes this making the instant payments (it still requires development but is already working). I run my own LND and this is my personal experience. 
Try Eclair wallet and check for yourself.

First of all, I wasn't talking only about asics in general but you for some reason are deliberately trying to make the point only about them making first false statement about not being able to start mining without huge investment, secondly switching to a different point of profit. 
Second of all, you can buy cheaper and her I found with Power  some places where you can buy already for $1120 with power supply unit included. 
Now go buy on Bitmain website for $800 w/o power supply unit deliver it in wherever you live, pay all the taxes etc and we will see what price you end up paying. 
As for the difficulty, yes, it increases but it doesn't stop people from mining, does it?

@_date: 2018-06-15 09:27:14
Well, for me and a non-native speaker it's pretty difficult to see the difference between "try not to" and "I suggest to not". It's still a suggestion. Besides try not to imllies buying with fist possibility. 
So it's a gradual process of shifting to Bitcoin without fiat. Otherwise you'd get stuck with constant pump and dump on exchanges process. 
So the suggestion is pretty complex to realize. But I disagree it would not remove volatility with fiat portion in circulation reduced tomkininum or zero.

Ok, let's make things easier for you. 1 Pound (or 1 Dollar) has lost up to 95% of its overall value for purchase basket due to inflation. 1 BTC will gain value in purchase basket (market indexes). 
The real bullshit here is trying to measure BTC in fiat. In a closed circular cryptoeconomy 1 BTC is 1 BTC having more value while deflating in self-adjusting free economy in  comparison to 1 dollar in a "modern" Keynesian centrally regulated economy.
Hope this helps.

I meant reserve currency hyperinflation. Venezuela is a country, poor country with poor development. 
The hyperinflation should be global en masse to bring en masse adoption of Bitcoin. Otherwise they, poor countries will be looking at rich ones, not realizing that those are the ones living at the expense of poor countries. Bitcoin brings individualism (anarchy) while unting people economically. Countries as states won't be able to exist once hyperinflation starts. 
It is nothing that Bitcoin nears, not at all, it is something massive institutions like Empires before and USA today are nearing themselves with statist policy and economics. 
Huge objects usually collapse under their own mass.
Bitcoin is an instrument and solution. It doesn't ruin, it creates an opportunity.

Agree, but they, at Brave, do not seem to have learned anything from 2017. Now they realize the Monopoly is ruined and free market gives a better solution. Competition is coming. Logical would be for them to integrate Bitcoin faster, having refused from their token. ))

@_date: 2019-04-25 19:25:48
That sounds like a much logical solution!
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:16:56
They should have tried better and start looking into the direction of onchain solutions or they can make a U-turn and do it now. It's a free market, let them compete.

Thanks for sharing. Never tried bitpay but they seem too complicated and clumsy. 
I as a vendor solved this matter in a cheap and fast way, asked my programmer to directly hook up my wallet on the website and voila  accepts Bitcoin without the need of any 3d party processing provider.

If that is what's happening, the market should demand a different implementation from it. They do what every business does. Let them know you want more decentralization.

Kraken is somebody's private property. The owner can do whatever he/she wants. The poll might have been only a cause or a reason to just prove their desicion to delist BSV. 
The people decide nevertheless what they want to use on the market, exchangers mean nothing for the real use case of money. 
But I personally support delisting and asked to delist BCH too and other shitcoins. Although it was more of a symbolic move.

@_date: 2019-04-25 22:37:51
I am not saying they were supposed to use LN, they could have started thinking about smth similar to LN, like their own solution. They didn't, like most of ICOs, they took an easier route. Can't blame them. The market said its word of consensus, now they are being protective as one can read from an article. Can't blame them either. But that is a destructive path from my experience. They better compete with what the market has to offer now. That's it.

@_date: 2018-03-26 14:42:48
Ignorance is based on little knowldge. For some reason 90% of people think and state their knowledge is far more pervasive than the others'. 
Are you that type of person? 
Evolution for Bitcoin core stops when the core is formed just like the core of the planet. Would you be willing to see the drastic changes of the Earth's core rigrh now? Or was it good enough 3 billion years ago? 
With the great value of Bitcoin (not only meaning its price in fiat) and 2d (maybe soon 3d) layers being built on top of Bitcoin it's pretty ignorant (throwing back at you your previous statement) and irresponsible to alter the core of Bitcoin, thus showing people instability and leaving them no trust. During the first iterations of its formation it could have gone some alterations but not now.
You can call me anti-fork anarchist!

1. Please dwell upon the idea of "changes" for currency so I could understand better. What currency do you mean? Provided we close the cycle on Bitcoin as a global currency with no need for any other currency or locked onto a few others with finite supply. 
4a. Let's assume you are right. They accumulate and then the value for this currency rises being appreciated by the goods and services provided. They don't spend much, the volatility  is small, with growing market and new goods and services demand for Bitcoin grows and the value rises again - deflationary  currency. Then even with the accumulation of Bitcoin in Elite's hands the value will be stable and growing.
When considering huge spending the wealthy people would think twice as the value of Bitcoin might depreciate causing short-term volatility allowing others to accumulate it and reinvest smart. 
The market should adjust itself accordingly. 
P.S. This is only IMHO, I am no expert in no way as one can't be expert in something which never existed. Just trying to brainstorm. 
I appreciate your replies.

@_date: 2018-03-28 18:08:12
Yes, to have - no need for Lightning. To be able to pay next to nothing for process micropayments LN is a great 2d layer on top of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 11:49:03
They are, but they are like competing with bitcoin system and eventually either win (unlikely), lose or stay together with it. And if they stay and be used along with Bitcoin they would create a similar situation we have now with fiat money when "institutional investors" percept Bitcoin as an investment, asset, or in the best case scenario as digital gold dumping it in favour of fiat creating swings and manipulations. Unless Bitcoin is considered "reserve global currency" and the rest of cryprocurrencies get manipulated. 
But whenever other getting along well with Bitcoin cryprocurrencies are percepted as almost equal it will most likely lead to Bitcoin inflation especially in case of non-finite cryptocurrencies. 
Once again, why in reality do we need other currencies if Bitcoin will most likely absorb all the better features of those currencies which once took off using Bitcoin code and/or structure? 
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:04:55
1. Volatile for now. Volatility happens due to exits into fiat.
4 a) when concentrated after spending (they would need to eat, live and invest, right?) its value might fall down with each iteration of spending. Short term it can be concentrated but might provide volatility in this case. No use in keeping it long-term in closed circular Bitcoin economy.

What you are talking about is although not so distant but future of at least 10 years ahead. We start thinking with faster time categories but this period is pretty far away to make conclusions right now like when the wrong conclusions were made about network congestion while BTC network was spammed until SegWit came (NO hardfork) to bring a solution. Do you keep up with the analogy?

Exactly. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:14:33
Well, actually LN is the chance to be successful for numerous "coins", due to nearest future of massive payments with crypto to remain, yes, decentralized. 
Basically you get decentralization in many ways through Bitcoin on a 1st core level, so to speak, while building the 2d layers of fast payments networks offchain and possibly 3d layer of smart contracts. 
Cause if you contemplate on it more you would realize that the amount of data required for processing huge loads of payments and smart contracts are not going to be efficiently supported by miners on the 1st level network. 
Think of all the additional data of offchain applications on Bitcoin or Litecoin, Monero or Karbo blockchains as websites and applications that once were on internet (www) network. 
That makes sense to me. Besides this LN offchain solution is very interesting in terms of atomic interblockchain swaps.

I "like" how those old world superduper economists discuss the volatility not seeing the real reason behind it, exchange rate and direct connection to fiat, not to mention regulations connected with all this fuss of exchanges and people jumping in and out of Bitcoin due to lack of understanding and thus feeling of FUD.

@_date: 2018-03-28 16:27:31
At the moment it is still for more techie savvy people but the network is growing exponentially. So eventually all Bitcoin wallets will have it as an implemented option I guess. 
Answering your question you don't really need it now.  
@_date: 2018-03-25 09:33:02
But isn't it the idea of money to be fungible and if received compare it to the suitcase of money found on the street without any evidence who it belongs to. 
In reality if you start spending this money there is no such a protection or anonimity mechanism as in Karbo or Monero but eventually it will appear in Bitcoin. 
Wouldn't you hold this money and wait until you can spend it? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:42:06
It might be one of the reasons. But I truly believe in free market that will find the way around any stupid regulations.

If you are going to use exchanges with KYC and buy Bitcoin there with fiat - forget about anonymity. 
With Schnorr signatures mostly likely coming into effect some time in the future you'll have more anonymity. 
At the moment you have a few solutions: 
1. Don't use fiat-bitcoin exchanges and you are pretty anonymous
2. Use Bitcoin mixers
3. Use Tor (better always ) 
4. Use one of those 2 anonymous  crypto you can find in the description of my profile here.

That seems to me like a simple answer, that explains the money stuck in between the channels would not be copied to the newly HF-ed blockchain which will make people willing to follow HF think twice. 
 Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 11:49:37
Well, it took me over 4 days to get to the point you see on the picture. Hope it'll not take longer than that for the rest to sync. Thanks for advice though. 
I heard people from libbitcoin did sync somehow 8n 3 hours but I can't figure how. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 04:03:10
That dude got money 'cause he works his ass off ) 
The value will adjust accordingly, that is why there is difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin system. Those miners who want to leave are welcome to do so having let the difficulty drop and let the other ones earn

Yeah, that seems pretty advanced. But what if the renter has no BTC and we limit ourselves this way ) 
Only the one with BTC will be able to access ?

About economy yes, about WWW - it's not that easy. But that is why Berners-Lee should understand that economical freedom will help decentralize the web.

Thanks a lot! 
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:11:48
Thank you. I also heard that libbitcoin somehow managed to do it within 3 hours or so. Can't imagine how this is possible at all. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 21:15:31
Yep, sounds cool though.

People in power are real frauds! 
Bitcoin is just the internet of money. 
Is internet a fraud?
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:21:58
That's right unless some authorities would start an investigation on another matter which might get the "innocent" clients involved and reveal their activity to someone they wouldn't want to. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:01:46
Legal means monopoly! That is some authorities legalize something. You know why Bitcoin users don't give a sh.t about claims of it being legal or illigal, cause it's designed by the best cypherpunks for whom the anarchy is not just a buzz word
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:02:08
Do those other coins plan to use LN too some day? 
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:11:34
There's no need for blockchain to scale. You don't want to scarifice security, do you? 
So accept the 2d and maybe soon 3d layers of offchain solutions working in decentralized manner. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:56:35
I don't think it's one guy. Probably a company or a few miners together trying to grow their lightning channels capacity and become a medium. By the way, I am also setting up my Lighting Node 
@_date: 2018-07-22 08:33:08
Hmm, I am still learning myself. I set up a channel with ACINQ (my node is called TUKAN) and I had to set up a minimum capacity of 100k satoshi
I am now thinking of how I can increase it ))
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:30:48
LN is growing, batches... So, no, I don't think so
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:56:37
That's right. Or here is another situation: 
Bitcoin of the customer got to his wallet from a so called black address (which is a complete bullshit and makes me wonder who's the bad guy here). The fungibility here is completely broken. 
The official authorities (that is monopolists on supreme power) start an investigation that get the customer involved and reveal his activity, say to his wife or kids, or/and colleges which ruins his life. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:25:08
Thanks, completely agree!
@_date: 2018-07-02 17:32:59
This is some nonsense. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 05:53:06
If you haven't yet, read more about LN and batching happening now and you get the idea of how erroneous your statement is. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:54:27
Exactly! A lot of room for Bitcoin evolution yet but steps taken by now prove to be the right ones. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 09:47:04
It's not about privacy here but about the value of something that might be under the hood of a technology. But everyone imagines what she/he wants to see here ))

WTF legal has to do with it? Anonymity is not about ligal or illigal but about sacredness of your activities you want to be left secret in case of "amoral" activities of authorities during their investigations. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:51:46
I meant this 
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:20:03
Agree, but not private enough yet. Although with shnorr signatures and bulletproof it will become one. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:28:29
Well, I agree in a way but I also realize these posts help another part of population percept the idea of the amount better. For many 0.00226147 BTC would tell little ))

Me too but as soon as people get away from fiat completely and big players with fiat have consequently no real influence on exchange I am sure the volatility will go down being only the case in connection to products and services. 
Besides the market will become smarter and hopefully more free

If you hold it in your own wallet with securily hidden private keys - no way they can do it

Yes and it's only the beginning. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 12:34:48
It does but not in Bitcoin. In some copy-coins coins, maybe. But now that everyone knows about it and knows it - it has no use and cannot do much harm. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 05:56:14
And what did you personally do, how did you help, what's your contribution into the development and what you are standing for to call the hard-working people behind Bitcoin monkeys?

You meant BTC? Yes, it's about time! ��

Very cool! Soon I'll have my own LN  node. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 05:22:38
Thank you for such a detailed back up information. 
I'd also wanted to add that with reward for block creation falling down the value if Bitcoin will most likely go up + the fees

Don't forget that your money in your bank doesn't belong to you and your card might be declined any time, money frozen or seized by the authorities. These things cannot happen with Bitcoin.

3 hours ago shared this article to my fellow community members in Ukraine, before saw it here. Wanted to repeat the same I had said in response to another article  where obviously the statist fans say obvious things fighting against the freedom and technology, trying this way to persuade people they had no choice. But there is choice, Bitcoin praised even by Time is a great example. So I repeat, even if it takes another 10 years, or 20 or even 30, I am prepared to wait and spread the word to educate as many people as I can - "they have a choice"! 
And when they do realize that it's not THEM in power (as if given by people) deciding the path people have to take but people themselves, I'd consider my life not wasted. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:17:37

Does the price in fiat really matter to you at the end of the day? 
Aren't we into Bitcoin for an obvious reason to make it the Means of exchange but not the Subject of exchange? 
So those counting their potential income in fiat mean to sell Bitcoin most likely without considering to buy it back and use it as a means of money. 
Isn't it a natural selection where Bitcoin finally gets into the "right hands"?

The technical problems you are naming are solveable. You probably are forgetting about the LN solution and smart-contracting on Bitcoin network in general. Not to mention other infrastructure that should and would evolve around Bitcoin which would allow more protection and safety around Bitcoin usage. 
Bitcoin is a core, build up more layers and don't get too deep into the rabbit hole. 
You don't use machine coding nowadays for programming, do you? 
Same will most likely happen to Bitcoin, you will be using other advanced and convenient (comfortable UX and UI) layers and applications. 
If you couldn't figure it out on 7 years, then you don't follow and do much for the developement
