He hasn't "realized" any gains yet because he didn't sell. There are zero tax implications "until" you sell and have actual gains. This is inaccurate advice.

Alfie is an idiot

There's some REALLY bad advice in this thread. Have them create an account on Coinbase that you manage. Do some more research and eventually move it to a cold storage wallet.

Any word yet on what Coinbase will support?

How are Litecoin and Ethereum "shitcoins"?
Litecoin already has SegWit activated...

Best answer: Buy on 
It's the exchange owned by Coinbase, which is the most trusted name in crypto currency exchange.
GDAX also has zero fees.

Please provide some proof of this

Just realize that it'd be cheaper &amp; faster (for you and customers) to go with Litecoin.

Doge is literally a joke, like actually. Do some research.

They are currently backordered, or they were a couple weeks ago

I suppose log scales are visually deceptive then. Just seeing it in the title now, so that was an oversight on my point.

There it is... hadn't noticed but as a man of my word, I'll keep the original post up.

The fees are simply getting insane. I now know what is going to happen on August 1st and I've officially placed my bet.

Cuban hasn't done anything of interest since 2000.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:45:32
So if he had 2FA via Google Authenticator, which everyone should have that holds on an exchange - then this would not have happened. He mentioned that he had used it before but didn't have it activated due to "convenience". Cmon.

This chart is not drawn to scale at all. Not even close. 
Look at 1-5, that's as large as 2000 - 5000.
Skewed data.
