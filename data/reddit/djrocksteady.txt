Just more evidence pointing to the fact that one of the founders of Reddit (the non-technical one) is using reddit as his personal playground to make money for his PR firm by having mods do the bidding of his clients. All the details are on r/undelete..you can even see his email convos with STRATFOR on wikileaks...so shameless
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:24:06
My guess is that these are accounts related to intelligence agency operations.

What do you mean horrible for the poor?

It happened to the dollar for like 20 or 30 years before the 20th century and it really wasn't that bad. They call it the long depression, but prices went down and purchasing power/wages went up during the period. On another note, lots of economic history has been skewed by the pro-central banking crowd. To that crowd, any drop in prices is something that central banks or governments have to fix to help out their banking cronies.

The fact that they had a conversation with an government intelligence consultant where they "met and talked about doing something with Reddit for social media" should be alarming to everyone on this site.

ELI5's don't work great with Bitcoin in my experience, just too complicated.
@_date: 2015-01-30 03:20:12
he was a co-founder who wrote a majority of the code and left the company when they were sold, what am I missing?
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:57:43
Reddit used to have a visionary, but he hated working for Conde Naste. 
Aaron Swartz was the one who came up with everything and the visionary who saw the fabric of the internet and what it needed. Everyone who works there now it just trying to maintain the house that he built.
EDIT:Aaron Swartz's legacy getting downvoted just shows how shit reddit has become, you all get the site you deserve
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:50:28
You wouldn't want to work there, your magazine-owning overlords would probably make life hell for anyone with original ideas. They prefer the "do as you are told and don't make waves" type.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:49:46
Wouldn't be the first time reddit choose doing nothing over innovation.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:51:24
Short answer, Aaron Swartz was reddit. 
Everyone after him was a pretender living in his shadow (Alexis, cough). There is no innovation, no vision behind anything they do other than "don't appear too corporate" (but do shady corporate deals with intelligence agencies in the background).
I mourn for the potential, but someone will either make a new better site or reddit will eat itself.

So basically anytime cash is involved you are guilty until proven innocent, the opposite of what our justice system is supposed to represent.
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:05:09
haha great comment from an employee who made this account to give the impression you are not a moron. Tell me who this miracle employee was that did all the early building but then had no new ideas? good on you for talking shit on a dead guy who can't defend himself.
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:07:02
Oh, in that case, tell me the engineer or employee that came up with the mechanics of the site, now that you can slander the dead
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:21:41
He was loved for many reason, reddit being a small portion of that.
You should watch this, it brought me to tears... it is an important story
[The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz](
EDIT: You didn't know about the connection for a reason, people at reddit like to keep quiet about Aaron. He was a rebel, with more balls than they would ever have.
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:00:27
Reddit is run by progressives who scoff at the idea of profit and they don't have the creative vision to pull anything off other than minor tweaks. The only reason any of them working have a job is because Aaron Swartz built the main features of the site and they have been living like parasites on his creation ever since.
Everyone after him was a pretender living in his shadow (Alexis, cough). There is no innovation, no vision behind anything they do other than "don't appear too corporate" (but do shady corporate deals with intelligence agencies in the background)
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:28:57
So, it is an app version of this?
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:13:28


I can think of a large group of people this would be very attractive to: Power vampires (aka the charge everywhere people)
This turns any open electrical outlet into a source of income...the implications of that are quite interesting.

Everyone moves to wireless, problem solved. Google has several projects in the works to mitigate the threat of captive wired connections. On top of that, the FCC should not be in the business of regulating the internet so they can block "unlawful" (meaning: anything the government doesn't like) content.
@_date: 2015-04-22 19:56:45


Verizon, AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-mobile
There are at least 3-4 major cable providers
Satellite internet still exists
There isn't "one" company controlling anything, and anything stupid that one ISP does, the others can then profit from when their customers switch. There are options, they might not be the best - but it isn't the bleak picture everyone keeps going on about.
@_date: 2015-04-23 19:49:11
I don't really buy that he killed himself at all, things were on the verge of turning around for him when it happened. The documentary about him really makes you question what happened from all angles.
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:45:27


I just watched the Rising and Rising Bitcoin documentary and got this exact feeling. This is something I can get into and support without any guilt. With all teh revelations about the corruption of the internet with mass surveillance, concurrency is a breath of fresh air. After viewing that doc, I decided my summer project is to read as many books and learn as much as I can about the tech.
@_date: 2015-02-27 15:31:16


How exactly would they keep this a secret from their suppliers and retailers?
@_date: 2015-02-01 08:49:54
I'll just take your word for it rather than some kind of source. I'm sure the lawyers at Conde have told everyone to tread this line.
@_date: 2013-12-29 09:09:49
Little wonder, they are the mouth piece for the status quo.
@_date: 2013-12-24 10:33:29
Not just a negative slant, a call for regulation to protect idiots that don't know what they are doing.
