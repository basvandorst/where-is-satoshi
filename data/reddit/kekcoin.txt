Minor correction, if I want to pay Bob through you via LN, the contract is set up so that you get paid IF AND ONLY IF you can prove that you have paid Bob.

It also can't work without the LN layer, so from a development perspective it is sensible to test and deploy that first before extending the functionality with this.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:41:33


Of course, I fully expect a reputation system to develop on LN; however the **security** of LN does not depend on this. After all, fees will be minimal, so a good reputation may not be as profitable as burning it to steal some funds and starting anew with another node. Therefore, even though a reputation system will help you find reliable channel partners that have high availability, connectivity, etc. You don't want to rely *solely* on reputation in order to avoid fraud.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:16:59


One of the major value prepositions of LN is that it is trustless; you don't have counterparty risk because you can recover your funds (and then some) if you are cheated on, and you can recover your funds if your counterparty goes unresponsive. Foregoing anti-fraud mechanisms opens yourself up to getting rekt, even if it is more likely not to happen.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:35:59


I mean that having a good reputation is only good for having lots of connections and therefore being able to claim a lot of LN fees, but since they are minimal, a big payday from a fraudulent close (even taking into account on-chain fees) may be worth years of fees, making burning your node reputation an acceptable loss (assuming your node is anonymous).


Yes we would, because it adds privacy and near-instant payments, as well as atomic cross-chain swaps and atomic money-for-data swaps.

Not just an incentive, it is also the metric responsible for allowing bigger blocks (up to 4mb hypothetically) while being backwards compatible with legacy clients.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:08:39
You're talking out of your ass. With the current version of LN, 20 hops is the max. Later protocol updates may change this, but 80 is clearly bullshit.
Furthermore, I have no reason to believe Bitcoin L1 has an avg node distance of ~1.2, where do you get this number from? Also, please point out what part of the paper you get the "3 hops" metric from, I don't see it.
Besides, you know your channel partners are legit, they have bitcoin tied up in the channel. I am not sure in what way you see a sybil attack as a possibility on LN.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:45:47
It will actually be configurable per channel. Say I can only reliably be checking for fraud once a week, then I will negotiate channels to have a 2-week anti-fraud locking period on unilateral (uncooperative) channel closes. On the flipside, that means that if one party goes unresponsive, there will be a 2-week delay in retrieving the funds from the channel, which encourages cooperative closes (these are just normal txes without lock period, since they are agreed upon by both sides).
If I can be online every day I might be okay with shorter anti-fraud periods. It's just a question of policy per node (a wallet is also a type of node).
Aside from that, fraud detection can be outsourced to providers who get to claim some reward, diffusing the trust even more.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:06:05


Inaccurate, the final transfer of ownership is still reflected on the blockchain, it is just that there can be many intermediate states that don't.


To make money by forwarding txes, yes, you need to be online most of the time. To use it, no, you only need to be online to send or receive money. To use LN safely you need to monitor your channels regularly, but there has been some work on outsourcing this to increase the security model for mobile wallets; I am not 100% sure on the latest info in this department, not sure if it is already implemented.


In the same way as it can set up an atomic forwarded payment (the forwarding parties can only get their money after they have forwarded it, in a way that they are guaranteed to get their money), it can set up such an "atomic forwarded payment" across different cryptocurrencies, essentially becoming a cross-chain atomic swap.


Mostly a FUD term, used extensively by trolls to imply LN will be completely centralized, which is false. Early speculation on the topography of LN was a hub-and-spoke model but this is already long outdated.


Depends on the response time of the nodes involved in the payment. In the case all nodes have no (connection) issues it should take less than a second.

Disposable is perhaps the wrong word because it implies a triviality to making a profitable mining operation, while it is most certainly not. However, it is certainly true that no Bitcoin node is going to bat an eye if one miner gets pushed into obscurity and is supplanted by (a) different one(s), and no matter what the hashrate does, it can not break the consensus rules enforced by the rest of the community.

This. I do think OP oversimplified the internals of miners (efficiency, network quality, availability of hardware and electrical energy, etc) but in the end, there are only two factors to miners that have a real impact as far as nodes are concerned;
1. Hashrate
2. Adherence to consensus laws
The wider system does not care how those are achieved, and any one miner is replaceable by any other.

Perhaps if your channel is underutilized they may close it after some time. Remember, they don't need you to cooperate with that (neither do you need their cooperation to close the channel if you want). Cooperation is simply cheaper since a cooperative close is a smaller tx and does not need to have a timelock on the coins (as part of LN's anti-fraud logic).
As for the point about money flowing one way; that's exactly the type of scenario where it'd be beneficial to use LN with your exchange, since you could buy more coins if you have exhausted your bitcoin and receive them over LN for near-0 TX costs.

Well even exchange transactions can become cheaper if you are selling back and forth. Arbitrage between exchanges for example, will be much faster with LN, equalizing the price more quickly.

For me personally, his pro-BCH stance is not a problem in and of itself, but it does aggravate the issues with his pushing through changes in bitcoindotorg unilaterally (without review or with in spite of significant negative feedback).
I do not believe Cobra would push through promotion of BCH on bitcoindotorg, but his mental gymnastics around whether it is a scam or not are worrisome when taking the above issues into account. One of his arguments was, at verbatim, "Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency, not a person, it can't scam you". According to that line of reasoning fake iPhone knockoffs branded with Apple logos tilted 30 degrees aren't scams because they are phones, not people.
Considering his lack of respect towards the long-time contributors of bitcoindotorg and their input on what is put on the website, it is becoming increasingly unpredictable what we WILL see on there, if not outright promotion of BCH.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:45:19
Seems to me you are being quite hypocritical here, on the one hand you make a point out of calling out everyone calling BCH "bcash", yet on the other you complain about someone else calling out people who call it "Bitcoin".
FWIW I don't call it "bcash" anymore personally (used to before people started making a fuss about it) since it triggers all the snowflakes and usually that just ruins any actual conversation that may be had (and conveniently, BCH is both accepted by those same snowflakes **and** a shorter and therefore more convenient shorthand).

What's wrong here is implicit pointer dereferencing. From a lot of context and more verbose wordings of the problem, people mean "to name a coin that is not Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, is a scam". What's wrong here is his grasping at strawmen to hold his position after he has been out-argumented.
Furthermore, a scam is literally an inanimate thing. It is an abstract construct - to say that only *people* could be a scam is showing a fundamental and possibly intentional lack of understanding of how English works. People can't be scams; people can be *scammers* but nobody accused BCH of being a scammer. For the benefit of you and any other readers, his message before the "it can't scam you" one was, at verbatim:


It's possible to think there may have been a message in between he was responding to rather than a continuation of his previous point, I've included the entire exchange here, at verbatim as well:






















It's not logically consistent at all to say that calling something a scam imbues it with moral intent - a scam is an act or scheme, not an actor, it has no intent. A cheap iPhone knockoff is more than its physical manifestation as a roughly bar-shaped box of electronics we recognize as "a phone" - it also includes e.g. the branding of it as an Apple product, in which lies the scam. Similarly, Bitcoin Cash is not just a cryptocurrency, it is also the branding of said cryptocurrency as "a form of Bitcoin", and within the situational context of a lot of distractions being made to make the "a form of" unheard, invisible or outright saying it is "the real" Bitcoin, yes, that makes it a scam.
But let's assume for a second that "scam" somehow has lost its actual definition and is in fact used to mean the word "scammer", what about his numerous tweets saying "Halong Mining is a scam"? How is it okay for him to imbue an inanimate abstract concept (legal entity) with moral intent any more than an object? It is clear as day he means that the people behind Halong Mining are scammers, so nobody has attacked him on the grammar of his claims, yet here he is, grasping at any possible strawmen he can get his eyes on to twist the argument in his favour.


Whether or not people are aware of the fact they are scamming someone has nothing to do with whether they are *actually* scamming people, just like how people can unwittingly commit fraud - but that does not make it any less fraud. I'm sure you are familiar with the concept of "duck typing". Everything is inherently subjective, I do not claim universal truth to my assertions and I do not need to own a mindreader and be able to say with absolute certainty whether someone is being intentionally fraudulent or simply delusional to call their fraudulently marketed product out as a scam.

Not exactly ELI5 but this is bleeding edge tech so fuck it.
Eltoo is a new payment channel design, which can be used as part of LN. The current LN channel design, "LN-penalty", relies on asymmetric information to punish your counterparty for attempting a fraudulent channel close with an old revoked state.
The new "eltoo" channel design uses a 2-step (update into settlement) state that allows one to doublespend the settlement transaction of an old state with the update transaction of a newer state before the settlement transaction of the old state can be used during a fraudulent channel close.
The big advantages of eltoo vs. ln-penalty:
* Lower storage cost for nodes and watchtowers; one only needs to store the latest state (in ln-penalty, one has to store all the revocation secrets for old states).
* Easier backups; old states in ln-penalty are "toxic information" - if you restore an old state from backup and try to close the channel with that, you will lose all your funds.
* Easier multiparty channels; because channel states are now fully symmetric (all counterparties have the same information), it is much easier to handle 3+ counterparties to a channel.
The big disadvantage of eltoo vs. ln-penalty:
* The game theory changes a lot for fraudulent channel closes; because the penalty of losing your funds is gone, the only cost/risk to attempting a fraudulent close is the mining cost of the fraudulent update transaction and the inefficiency of a non-cooperative close.

So you don't think the controversial changes pushed through unilaterally (under loud shouting of ITS MY PERSONAL PROPERTY I CAN DO WITH IT AS I WISH when criticized on this), as well as your actions outside of it such as considering assassination markets a valid option to deal with those you disagree with, both of which have been alienating many contributors in recent time, affect its integrity whatsoever?
@_date: 2018-05-16 11:40:00
An algorithm is a collection of unambiguous instructions that solves a certain problem. In this case, the problem is "what is the minimum difficulty for a block to be valid?".
It's ironic that you rhetorically ask whether a shopping list is an algorithm, expecting an obvious "no", but a shopping list or checklist can in fact be a part of an algorithm, for example one that performs automated airplane maintenance. And every item on the list can have a subalgorithm to perform that particular check.
Furthermore, the full node software is not merely a helper tool to automate the checklist; the implementation of the consensus rules actually **defines** them. In bitcoin consensus, code is law. In other words, if there is a discrepancy between the documentation and implementation of the consensus rules, it is the documentation that is incorrect, not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-08-06 12:14:55
A couple of things off the top of my head:
* Direct merges (bypassing review) by both Cobra and Will Binns, including e.g. [a blog post about promoting Bitcoin Knots over Bitcoin Core]( and the donation address that is fully owned by Will Binns alone.
* PRs with a lot of negative review and NACKs being merged [(github)](
* Cobra's insistence that bitcoindotorg belongs to him as it is legally owned by him, and therefore it is his to do with as he sees fit.
* Cobra's comments outside of bitcoindotorg management alienating long-time volunteer contributors, e.g. John Newbury stopped contributing after Cobra made remarks about assassination markets in context of S2X (which Cobra strongly opposed).
This is by far not an exhaustive list, as I am not actively involved in bitcoindotorg; if you want to know more it's perhaps better to ask or others, but hopefully this makes it already clear that discontent with bitcoindotorg management has been building for some time, since long before Cobra started promoting BCH.

It's not about "recent" backups, it's about "the most recent" backup. Anything else will lose you funds in the old protocol. And if your node crashes/you have an outage/whatever you have no way of verifying that your last backup truly represents the latest state.

Bullshit service.




That's not in any way comparable to ViaBTC's accelerator. They are a mining pool, and will prioritize inclusion of "accelerated" txes in their blocks.




The transaction is not on the blockchain yet, that's the whole reason it's "stuck" in the first place. You're right that you can't steal bitcoins if people only submit txids though.




Honestly since this is the entire point of the service it's kind of surprising to see you (rightfully) claim that it's entirely pointless to use it. Besides, in the rare case of it being a real problem then your node probably didn't receive the transaction either, so submitting only a txid will not do anything.

Occam's razor is talking about theoretical answers, not practical solutions. It's also not about "the simplest" being the most preferable, rather the one with the least assumptions. It's also more of a guiding heuristic rather than a deciding arbiter; in many cases it will only bring you to a local optimum, not a global one.
If there are two channel designs for LN - ln-penalty and eltoo - and one is simpler, it might be more preferable if the properties are otherwise the same, but if two scaling solutions - massive blocks vs. lightning network - are compared, the simpler might in fact be the inferior option.
Besides that, we're talking exercise here, so Occam's doesn't really apply. More important than "simplicity" is good form, you're doing a quite bad job at explaining that. Also:

While you are free to use the word "algorithm" for any purpose you want, the rest of the world is free to disagree and use the proper meaning.
Your posts are rife with misunderstandings, perhaps you should read more before stating falsehoods.
Your understanding of the difficulty algorithm is plain wrong, where did you learn that? Did you come up with it by yourself? The real difficulty is set per 2016 blocks, based on the average time difference of the previous 2016.
Consensus layer changes are not agreed upon by miners, this is a common misinterpretation of BIP9, which is about signalling readiness. Which is likely not to be reused since it was abused for political purposes. Probably BIP8 will be used instead.
I will reemphasize that the consensus rules are defined by the software implementation. Just because consensus changes are discussed before they are implemented does not mean the implementation is not the actual consensus code.
Alternative implementations are risky, because if they do not implement the same **exact** logic as bitcoin core, they risk following an invalid chain and losing the user's funds. Google "bug for bug compatibility".

You can run your node in pruned mode which will only keep the last X MB of blockchain (it's configurable down to a pre-compiled minimum). You won't help the network out in terms of archival service, and anomalously large reorgs might force you to resync the entire blockchain if you use the minimum value, but those are very unlikely to happen (unless we introduce EC ;))

@_date: 2017-03-29 12:59:57
I did refine my arguments based on yours, yes. How about this rephrasing?
The AD parameter means nothing unless it is set to infinity, is a red herring to inflate idea of node control when its just pure miner control when set to a finite value. If most of the network runs a AD parameter of 6, it only takes a hashrate majority about an hour to push ANY size block through, even if that block size is absurdly large compared to the EB value present in most of the network.
In the case of Classic's implementation (effectively; AD = infinity) the algo leads to unpredictable hardforks that don't need to be announced or planned; if 70% of the network has EB &gt;= 4MB and 30% has EB &lt; 4MB miners might decide to start mining 4MB blocks causing 30% of the network to be hardforked off, which the people running those nodes won't even immediately realize they are on a dead-end chain.
This can just be forced if there is a consensus within the hashrate majority, which plays into the hands of centralized miners. Just imagine how easy it would be for rich bankers to utterly destroy Bitcoin by buying up hashrate and constantly forcing hardforks.

Just an example of an additional change besides the block size; in Core the max TX size is the same as the max block size. If Core bumped the max block size to 2MB then BU would reject blocks that Core would accept.

Utter confusion as to why anyone with a shred of sanity would ever run BU, **ESPECIALLY** if not even making use of its one defining function (essentially, the setting would enforce the exact same block size rules as Core currently does).

Ah, you see, Nakamoto's central assumption about the validity of the chain was that the majority of hashpower was acting honestly. Majority of hashpower running the EC protocol would go against my definition of acting honestly, so from my perspective there would be no valid chain.

Alright, you can drop your shenanigans right fucking now. I know what a hard-fork is, it's a technical term and I am using it correctly. I'm not using some vague newspeak "protocol upgrade" euphemism, I am calling a duck, a fucking duck.
Just because I am active on (where, by the way, I've been bashing heads with the pro-BU/EC crowd near-constantly, it's not like I came there to agree with their views) does not mean that you can bully me into dropping valid jargon.
SegWit does not (at first?) increase the size that TX'es take up; still 1 MB per block, which is a specifically designed measurement to make it NOT A HARDFORK BUT A SOFTFORK. This was an intentional, by design part of SegWit, I'm not sure how deep you have to have your head up your own ass to think that's some pro-BU propaganda.

It's been pointed out by others that this idea of nodes having any sort of say in EC is a misrepresentation. If 99% of the nodes signal EB1/AD6, yet a small majority (51%) of miners want to mine 2 MB blocks they can just go ahead and do it; if they mine 6 blocks on top of their 2 MB block they can just force it down the network's throat. You deny this.
Now, admittedly, I am not that familiar with the intricacies of (BU's implementation of) EC, so please tell me in what way BU (or another form of EC) does not allow miners to dictate block depth over nodes' wishes? Is there any point at all in letting nodes have a vote?

In the blockchain. It is a big, public ledger that keeps track of all transactions in Bitcoin's history. What you have, in your Bitcoin wallet, whether it's paper or digital, is the cryptographic secret that lets you spend that money, and what prevents others from spending it.


Great question; a term that is often used when discussing this is [fungibility]( Bitcoins by default are not fungible; indeed, everyone can see how every individual Bitcoin moves across the blockchain. For this very reason, [joinmarket]( was invented. By mixing your Bitcoins with those of others in a "smelting pot" over and over, it is made impractically hard for someone to try and track which Bitcoins exactly belong to you.

BU propaganda tactics are heavily based around conflating issues. Writing Segwit supporters off as "small blockers" and asking rhetorical questions about why we can't go past 1MB while Segwit bumps the blocksize cap up to 4MB, insisting on the notion that people who don't want BU must not want *any* size increase, etc. etc.

Actually both terms are valid, they just mean subtly different things, and both can make sense in this context. An attack vector corresponds to a specific vulnerability that is exploited in an attack, whereas an attack surface is the area where potential attack vectors are found.
Shitty analogy time; if you have a fence around a perimeter, the whole fence is an attack surface whereas an attack vector is a specific hole in the fence.
Attack surface is a useful concept when talking about software and generally IT systems (of which the Bitcoin ecosystem is one) because the bigger/more complex/hard to verify a codebase/system is, the bigger/harder to secure the attack surface.

You could run a pruned node. I do, my entire fully-validating trustless Core node setup fits on a 16 GB usb stick. Sure, that harms the decentralization of the blockchain archive, but it's a good intermediate step. Perhaps the Bitcoin network needs some incentivization for full-archive nodes.

Thanks for the strikethrough; I really do my best to direct my arguments against viewpoints, not people.

I'm not one to roll over. But I do try to be productive rather than destructive.


Honestly I think that this shitstorm will die down when there is some relief in terms of TX space on the chain. I think the introduction/adoption of LN would make that work, I just think that it's better to solve the problem *right* rather than *right now*, because any successful protocol change will be nigh-impossible to reverse, and Bitcoin will forever have to bear the burden of today's changes.


At 10 min per block that would take 1440 min = 24 hours to happen. Which means that it's a 24-hour reorganization, which means to trust a transaction to "actually" have happened you have to wait 24 hours... And this can literally happen any time the miners decide to without any warning... This amount of uncertainty about what happens in the network will, in my speculative idea of things to come, surely drive people away from Bitcoin.


You seem like a reasonable fellow. I don't think it's impossible for us to be civil even if we disagree. Yes, I express myself strongly about BU and EC in more general form, but that doesn't mean I extend that value judgment to the people who think it is a good idea. There are many reasons to be in favor of EC, I just think that the reasons against it outweigh the reasons for it.

... What principles are you referring to?
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:49:13
EC stands for the EB/AD mechanism as implemented by BU and Bitcoin Classic. My analysis of why it is fundamentally broken:
EB and AD are settings that every full-node has to keep. EB stands for Excessive Block. A block bigger than this setting will not be accepted by your node. AD stands for Acceptance Depth; if miners have a different idea about EB size than your node and decide to build on top of a block that is "too big", your node will accept it anyway if the big block has more than AD number of blocks on top of it.
This leads to 2 ways it will fuck with your node if your EB is set to a lower value than the miners', depending on what your setting for AD is.
If your AD is finite, let's say 6, this leads your node to suddenly jump to a different chain after 6 blocks, or about an hour worth of blocks on average. If most nodes in the network have AD 10, you are effectively on AD 10 as well since they won't pass along the "invalid" chain to you before it becomes valid to them. Expect frequent reorganizations. Say goodbye to zero-conf transactions. This will also wreak havoc on pruned nodes (one way that running a full-node without having to dedicate a large amount of storage to keeping the block chain is made viable) since the reorganization can easily go back in time to before their history horizon (especially with large block sizes) and they will have to redownload THE ENTIRE BLOCKCHAIN.
If your AD is infinite (in the case of Bitcoin Classic) or very high (manual setting), then you will simply never jump to the majority-PoW chain. The chain you follow will be orphaned by most if not all miners and you won't realize until you take a look at the block times and see that instead of a block every 10 minutes, there's been a block every few hours or not at all, for the last day or so (otherwise it could be variance). Oh, and you probably can imagine that in a network consisting mostly of Bitcoin Classic nodes with low EB (let's say 2MB), you'd never hear of blocks that exceeded that EB even if they did not exceed *your* EB. *��Hard fork erryday��*
So, the only "solution" for either scenario is for the entire non-mining network to run EB = infinite, which is basically equal to not using EB/AD at all and just removing the hard blocksize cap. So why the whole kludge of EB/AD when that simple solution is technically superior in almost every way? (Of course, removing the blocksize cap itself has its own fair share of problems but I won't go into those here).

BU supporters are free to think of that view as whining but don't come crying when the network doesn't accept it. Bitcoin to me represents freedom. BU side often touts the argument that decisions should be left to "the market". I am part of the market, and I reject BU.

True, I was just alluding to the fact that it also lets more TXes fit into 1 MB because the witness data is moved out of that part of the block, so it is also an effective size increase for 1MB-limited nodes.

@_date: 2017-03-29 06:58:00
Bitcoin Classic has no AD parameter (effectively AD = infinity, same as in Core), and while I think that it makes it less dishonest of a proposal, it doesn't remove the problems regarding constant reorgs/hard-forks/not knowing your full-node is on some dead-end chain unless you up your EB parameter.
@_date: 2017-03-29 09:35:37


Alright, cool. A "destroy reliability of block validation" button isn't an option I want in a Bitcoin client, even if I know I'm not going to press it.


Working on it :)


s/not //


They become a problem if the fork stays alive for 4-6 blocks (depending on the value of AD for the majority of clients) before being reorged. I'd rather have instantly trustlessly verified transactions through LN rather than have to wait for I don't even know how much confirmations before being able to trust a transaction.


Must be why I am engaging in serious discussion on both sides of the fence.


I'd love to hear those reasons even if they are just speculation. We humans are pretty intelligent creatures, speculation is a form of uncertainty-based prescience and vital to deciding what action to take.

Indeed, you will have validated all blocks in the entire blockchain from the genesis block. In other words, you will still have to *download* and let your little pi crunch through the entire blockchain, which may take some time, but you won't have to store it.

Actually, what they did was move the hardcap away from blocks but onto transactions. Meaning, transactions over 1MB are still rejected even if the blocksize is 1GB. Would require another hardfork to change in the future if BU ever took over (but lol, who would entrust their bitcoins to BU code).

Well, for example they introduced a [DEFAULT_LARGEST_TRANSACTION]( set to 1MB to deal with the quadratic hashing problem; something that would need a hard-fork to remove or make more flexible. Not exactly future-proofing their own code.

Does segwit remove the 1MB hardcap, allowing for future TX blocksize increases without hardforking?
@_date: 2017-03-28 18:48:23
Ah, you misunderstood, that implication was not intentional. I meant, purely, what do Core devs think about the idea of increasing block size. Do they think it's a desirable idea, do they think it's a bad idea, how do they predict block size will change in the future, short and long term, that kind of thing. I do get that raw "resource" increase as represented by block size scaling is not the only possible way to increase TX throughput, there's also techniques to improve efficiency, off-chain scaling, all those kinds of things.
Just seemed to me that I had no good information about what the Core devs actually think about block size scaling; I wanted to zoom in on the issue and cut BU/EC out of scope; BU/EC is a terrible idea but is block size scaling itself also bad or what.
I now have an immense wealth of information straight from the sources; the Core devs themselves, and have had a very wonderful opportunity to engage in civil discussion with them (and others). No worry about misunderstanding or having someone relay the arguments and (un)intentionally distorting them in the process.
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:21:32

@_date: 2017-03-31 08:28:12
My perspective is that EC as in the EB/AD voting system will inevitably lead to regular reorgs and unpredictable hard-forks. That's why I am against it. I see less technical issues with just removing the blocksize cap altogether rather than EC.
Although I don't think that removing blocksize cap is a good idea either; profitability of Bitcoin mining was designed to gradually proceed into being mostly TX-fee based, so a lack of blocksize cap will be bad for miners as TXes only need to offer the bare minimum fee (1 satoshi, until we can do sub-satoshi payments, then it will be even less) to be included in a block.

BU organization is suspicious, codebase lags far behind Core's improvements, added code is dubious quality, testing protocols seem bad. EC protocol is just absurdly stupid.
I can hold those opinions and still think that hard-forks are not *necessarily* evil, if done in consensus and coordinated well, and I can still see the need for bigger blocks (hell, even SegWit is a block size increase, are you against it?)

It feels to me that there are too many uncertainties about the needed block size already now and more so in the future to advocate for a measure that is dependent only on time and not on the actual state of the ecosystem. We don't increase difficulty by time, we increase it by a reasonably-reliable measurement of the available hash rate (assuming miners are greedy and not holding back hash rate).
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:43:33
Thanks! This is the kind of understanding of the long-term vision I was hoping to catch a glimpse of.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:28:28
AD parameter means nothing unless it is set to infinity, is a red herring to inflate idea of node control when its just pure miner control. The algo almost surely leads to constant reorgs, hard forks, will /destroy/ reliability of payments. A lot of BUers have a hardon for zeroconf, I dont see how they figure that working out when EC kicks in.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:15:45
1) I don't agree that a hard-fork must always be strong-armed. I fully agree that BU's coercive and bullying tactics are bullshit, but that's not the kind of hard-fork I would support.
2) I think that geopolitical factors such as available bandwidth and electricity costs play a much larger miner-centralizing role than block size.
3) The current criticism to anti-BU/EC (FUD as it may be) is that it has a centralizing effect towards the devs.
As to the gist you posted, from a quick skim that seems similar to BIP101 except maybe with a different curve, but it is the same core concept of a blocksize function with timestamp parameter, right?
@_date: 2017-03-28 04:13:59

How would that come to be? Through a majority-hash empty-block attack on the minority-hash chain? That's the only way it would grind to a halt.


Still think that, I just think that you don't need to be an absurdly stupid *person* to not realize that EC as a protocol is absurdly stupid. It's a highly technical discussion which makes it really hard to fully see the implications, and the amount of decentralization in Bitcoin makes it so that a lot of people who care about it, might not have the technical expertise to "see through" what EC would entail/what kind of attack surfaces it opens up on the protocol. This lack of insight is not a value judgment of anyone in particular; there are plenty of things in the world that I don't understand properly. I'm not saying that I think people are stupid for supporting BU/EC but I do maintain that EC itself is stupid. I do realize that the way I express my views sometimes plays into that confusion, though.
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:04:16
Calling out (potentially) buggy patches to Core and spreading awareness that people should not blindly rush to run this code (a couple of hours ago I saw a comment somewhere stating there were already 11 nodes in the network running the dubious patch) is not FUD, it's called being prudent.
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:51:36
To go into specifics as I've literally read up on this yesterday; the only information about the *transactions in the* block that is actually used in the mining process, is the merkle root of the transactions (you can see it as a hash of the hashes of all transactions), which is always the same size no matter the amount of transactions.
Edit: added the part in italics to make my statement more accurate.
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:05:04

Why would I change to a terrible code-base just to keep the same functionality as I have now? I've seen this reasoning around a lot but I don't get it. Why would I change my client to one whose only advantage is some specific functionality, when I don't want that functionality? Just because I can configure this functionality to work exactly the same way as my current solution provides does not mean it is advantageous at all for me to switch, especially with BU's shoddy implementation and testing.


Yes, but the whole algo causes those forks to happen far more regularly, which increases the risk of "being on the wrong side" a lot, makes me have to baby my full node rather than letting it run unattended, etc. I would want everyone to run a full node to increase Bitcoins resilience as a network, and the more running a full node requires constant attention, the less likely that is to happen.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:21:57
Ah yes, fair point. Perhaps some clever reverse-order block syncing could be rigged up?

Here's a hint: ⚡⚡
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:28:32
I have not seen enough analysis of the idea of EC to support or reject it; I'm currently ambivalent about EC but not so much about the way BU is strong-arming the network.
To my limited knowledge about EC it seems to harm usability of fullnode Bitcoin clients as it seemingly forces people to pick a setting and respond to changes in the network in this setting or risk being subject to frequent reorgs/increasing the amount of confirmations you need before you can trust a transaction. Ideally I'd want everyone and their grandma to run a full node, and "having a sane default value" that is required for out-of-the-box usage goes against the very principle of EC.
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:19:18
What does that have to do with anything? If all you want to do is signal your support for SegWit UASF just change the client name (or version number) and don't run buggy consensus code until it has been fixed. The correct implementation should not kick in until a few months from now anyway, so there's no reason to rush out and run code that potentially messes with consensus. Not that this code does; it - by accident - is not harmful, but that's no good reason to run it.

They will as soon as the 6-block limit is reached, and the miners don't need the nodes' support to distribute the blocks amongst themselves. And in fact now that I think of it, this would go for 2GB blocks as well, even if most of the network says it wants 1MB blocks. EC is just very poorly thought out at this point, and the kind of strong-arm tactics proposed by BU supporters to force this onto the economic majority is showing their hand prematurely.
@_date: 2017-03-29 08:02:26
Maybe things have been going "too slow", but there's a relevant Chinese proverb (they're like pre-internet XKCD's); "The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is now".
Rushing into a "hotfix" that not only needs a hard-fork (bad in the short term) but also has very undesirable qualities in the long run is not the way forward if we want Bitcoin to remain the amazing thing that it is. Only way I could support a hard-fork blocksize bump as solution to the current debacle is if it also included SegWit or FlexTrans (not sure which of those would be superior in the case of a hard-fork).

It doesn't ignore that notion. It purposefully challenges it - people act like Bitcoin has an obligation to keep its fees sensible in terms of fiat and I think we should care more about fees in terms of Sat/B.
In terms that may be more familiar to your fiat-centric model:
Avg tx size = ~500 B
If you pay 10 Sat/B (low fee tx), with current prices that's 500\*10\*0.00000001\*4500 = $0.23. This "lower bound" is only going to go up as the price goes up. Do you *really* want to buy your coffee onchain?

The status on the BIP page does not reflect adoption; many BIPs that run in production are in "draft" status.
As for the "Informational BIP" the explanation can be found [here]( (I'm sure you read it but providing link for others). In this case, you could argue that it could have been classed as a Standards Track BIP, but stratum protocol stuff is "internal" to mining operations and does not touch the "regular" P2P node network, so perhaps the Informational BIP type was chosen on that basis.
Edit: [According to luke-jr]( BIP 310 was developed behind closed doors and did not undergo the regular peer-reviewed BIP process, so that could also play into why it is an Informational BIP ("documenting that this is how this thing works").

And you're overlooking that a doublespend isnt trivial to pull off either, since (unless using opt-in rbf, which states in its specification that using it gives the recipient reason to hold off on accepting the tx until it is confirmed) it needs collusion with a miner.

@_date: 2018-06-26 23:45:24


It's already live, has been for quite some time now.


Misunderstanding (common type of FUD, actually); people CAN use the money that is in channels, in fact, using the money is what the channels are for! They allow you to send instantly-secured txes without having to wait for blocks. 
Related: money isn't "locked" in channels anymore than that money is "locked" in bitcoin addresses. You simply have a 2-of-2 multisig address, with the special condition that if your channel partner doesn't cooperate in sending your part of the money from the channel elsewhere, you can just close it on your own.


Common misunderstanding (and FUD) as well; well-performing hubs aren't a problem - as long as they can be routed around they cannot misbehave (routing fee gouging, tx censorship, etc.) LN is P2P, any node can grow into a "hub" if it simply does its job well. Hubs are just relatively big nodes, that is all. And if a hub somehow becomes a central point of failure and starts misbehaving, a few channel opens will fix that quickly.


As explained by others, but included here for sake of completeness; there are various fundamental differences between (fiat) banks and LN. KYC/AML comes to mind, as well as (and more fundamentally) its non-custodial nature, meaning your channel partner cannot steal your funds or stop you from using them, which fiat banks CAN do.


This seems like a summary, the only arguments for why the LN incentivization would somehow degrade into "fiat banking" were mentioned earlier and I have hopefully cleared up why they don't hold up.
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:53:25


Same way that you don't calculate bitcoin addresses by hand, you will not have to deal with manual channel management, your LN node will take care of that in the background. Sure, a gearbox is a complex piece of engineering, but it's worth having one in your car.
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:04:44
Yeah, that's true, and it *is* exhausting to deal with.
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:48:17
Both will remain, but Segwit is cheaper and has more features (LN requires Segwit). They are equally safe.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:09:22
There is need for some type of collusion since using the p2p protocol the miner won't get your double-spend transaction if it's not RBF-enabled. So you need to send your tx directly to the miner (technically mining pool), who has to accept it outside of the regular channels.
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:27:12
Some of those arguments are accurate, some not. E.g. being online to receive payment, yes, true, thats different from regular bitcoin. The thing about relying on businesses that you have to pay and that can potentially block people is true for miners as well.
There are different tradeoffs between the two, thats just how a lot of things work. A truck is slower than a lambo but if you need to haul some cargo the choice is obvious.

Hold reserves? What are you talking about? All the money you have in channels is available to be used.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:16:54
Im actually curious about the numbers now. What are the chances of successfully propagating a doublespend tx to a mining pool if you dont manually create a direct connection to their node? I dont presume you know, but it might be an interesting experiment.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:27:09
Technically both are signalling. Version string signalling is just a lot more efficient, but just because a signal is inefficient doesn't make it "not a signal". The key difference between NYA signalling and e.g. Segwit signalling is that the Segwit signalling also changed the behaviour of user nodes, whereas NYA signalling has no effect.

Every hop your payment is routed through will (probably) charge a fee (you also get a fee for routing other people's txes). It would be a race to the bottom though, as your node would look for a route that goes through cheap hops.
As a ballpark figure, let's assume 10 hops at 5 sat/hop (that's highballing it), that means your LN tx costs 50 sat.
Compare this to the fact that a cost of 50 sat/wu isn't strange for on-chain, and the fact that on-chain txes are measured in the hundreds of weight units and you can do the rest of the napkin math yourself ;)

My point is just turning on version bit 14 in all the blocks won't do much without a client that responds to it. You'll just get a big fat warning UNKNOWN RULES IN EFFECT in core, and that's it. In theory a client could be made that does respond to NYA coinbase strings and changes its consensus rules based on that. But now I'm just getting into technicalities.
My main point was; the word "signalling" has a specific technical meaning and its use within the context of bitcoin is not fundamentally different. Just because BIP9 has formalized some version bit signalling system for use in softfork upgrades (specifically softfork, btw, check the BIP - its not designed to be used for hardforks) doesn't mean that that's now the only meaning of "signalling" that is allowed to be used.

I agree, but I also think that the fewer hardforks, the better, because they are a bitch to coordinate. Hardforks basically kick anyone who hasn't upgraded by the (immutable) deadline out of the network, so they need lots of lead time.
Also, to look specifically at what the fork we are discussing changes; so far I haven't seen any solid technical arguments against Segwit. I'd love to hear some, but so far everything I've heard has either turned out to be untrue (e.g. it makes later blocksize increases harder, it doesn't increase TX capacity, etc.) or the people who tout it don't hold it against something else (supposed technical complexity touted by Jihan who then turns around and praises ExtBlks that are far more problematic).

You are **WRONG**. A 4 mega-byte block, which is what would be allowed under Segwit, is bigger in **every conceivable way** than a 1 mega-byte block.
Using your retarded analogy, Segwit is going from a 1 kg bag of unpeeled nuts, to a bag that contains max. 1 kg of peeled nuts and max 3 kg of nut peels. This means that yes, there is a "discount" on nuts with bigger peels, but also IT **ALLOWS FOR MORE NUTS** AND **IS A BIGGER BAG IN EVERY WAY**.

False. If you can find a way to squeeze more PoW out of the same amount of work, then that is an optimization.

For sure, but so does **any** optimization. The difficulty readjustment mechanism is supposed to counter this.
* Does it constitute a cryptographic attack?
Most definitely. Something can be both. Actually, I'd say that most cryptographic attacks are algorithmic optimizations.

Serious answer - pay attention, because shit gets funky here because the retard bag analogy no longer makes real-world sense because lol crypto aint bags of nutcases, but lets try and shoehorn it in anyway.
# Pre-segwit
* A bag of nuts is allowed to be 1 kg.
* All nuts require a peel to be sure they are kosher nuts.
* It is noticed that the tastiest nuts have the heaviest peels.
* We want to put as many nuts into a bag as possible, which means inferior nuts tend to be cheaper.
# Post-segwit
* A bag of nuts is allowed to be 4 kg.
* We can weigh the peeled nuts and nut peels separately, and put a weight metric in place that enforces a maximum of 1 kg peeled nuts.
* All nuts require a peel to be sure they are kosher nuts.
* When passing the nuts to an old node that only allows 1 kg bags, we only pass peeled nuts.
* For this reason, legacy nut-processors can no longer verify that the nuts are kosher, but they still get all the nuts; it's better than e.g. extblocks that spread nuts over multiple bags and only pass the first bag to legacy nut-processors.
* Because of the effective discount on peels, we get to pass around more nuts while at the same time the tastier nuts get less expensive, relatively speaking.

First of all, you don't need to understand the intricacies of the technical aspects of Bitcoin to use it, in the same way that you won't need to understand the intricacies of things like Lightning Network to use it. Here's what you need to know:
Bitcoin transactions aren't secured until they are in a block. On average a block is found every 10 minutes, so even if you pay a priority fee to get included ASAP there's still a waiting period that's not convenient. Some people think zero-confirmation transactions are an acceptable risk for most uses but there's still a risk involved.
On the other hand, 2nd layer solutions only have this kind of a waiting period for the opening of a payment channel, after that, every transaction is as instant as sending an IM, completely secured without any third party trust involved. And better yet, when people have multiple channels open they can relay transactions, which means that a network can be created to send payments to anyone who is on the network without needing a direct channel.
How? Well, I'm still reading up on the exact cryptographic details myself, but the idea is that using so-called "smart contracts", you hand eachother the ability to punish eachother for being unfair. We both have an amount of Bitcoin "tied up" in the channel; if either of us breaches the contract and tries to cheat the other, the other gets to claim all of the Bitcoins in the channel, so we are both incentivized to be honest.
Using this system, we can send eachother payments by sending "promises" of how the Bitcoins tied up in the channel will be redistributed between us if/when we decide to close the channel, and sending "promises" that we won't use the previous (now invalid) "promise". If at any point you try to claim a previous (now invalid) state is the currently valid one and try to steal coins from me by closing the channel in an unfair way, I can use the cryptographic evidence of your promise invalidation to claim all the Bitcoins in the channel. These promises are exchanged off-chain, so they don't have to wait to be included in a block, but are still effectively fully functional as transactions because of the mechanisms of invalidating the previous states.
There's also benefits to privacy; as you might know in Bitcoin all transactions are fundamentally public as they are recorded in the blockchain. They aren't tied to your name or anything, but they can still be traced, are subject to statistical analysis etc. In the Lightning Network they have implemented onion routing of payments which means that every payment node in the network between me and you (assuming no direct channel between us) only knows who they are receiving coins from and to whom they pass them, but have no information about the origin or final destination of those coins.
Hopefully this wasn't too rambling of an answer for you ;)

It doesn't illustrate how Segwit signalling ends up at 100% or how that affects BIP 9 activation.
Easy fix:
1. "Reject block" needs an outgoing arrow looping back to "block"
2. "Accept block" needs an outgoing arrow looping back to either "BIP 9" or "Locked in?"

True, segwit drops legacy fullnodes to somewhere between full node and SPV status. This is better than any other block size increase proposal, though (extblocks drop legacy fullnodes to worse than SPV status, hardfork drop legacy nodes full stop).


No, everyone is encouraged to upgrade and benefits from upgrading, but is still functional without upgrading.


A hardfork would always lead to a chainsplit and legacy nodes might be scammed by "believing" spends in the abandoned chain.


Could you elaborate here? I don't recall any such changes happened in making Segwit a soft-fork. I believe this is FUD, but I'm willing to give you the opportunity to present a scenario in which these assertions hold true.


Are these proposals compatible with legacy TXOs?


That's a non-issue. People don't need to understand cryptographic hashes to use Bitcoin backed by a SHA256-based PoW. It feels to me you are projecting *your* failure to understand onto people who just want to use Bitcoin.


Is there? I am not aware of such a viable solution. Of course, if one can avoid unnecessary problems then one should; that's the whole reason softforks are inherently superior to hardforks (given that the other variables don't change).

Right, but that's just in the miners' interest, not in that of the entire network. For sure we should make sure that miners are incentivized because they secure the network, but their priorities aren't in line with that of the entire network and that is a problem.


I don't see that centralized LN hub threat. And 2nd layer solutions will _always_ need 1st layer or they won't exist.


Sure, you'll note I didn't bring up block size scaling specifically, merely talked about scaling solutions in general.

# The blockchain
The blockchain is a really simple concept; a chain of blocks of data, each referring to the previous one. Inside the Bitcoin blockchain are transactions. So, in essence, the Bitcoin blockchain is nothing more than a huge transaction log.
# Transactions
Transactions have inputs and outputs. The inputs of normal transactions are outputs of previous transactions. The value of the inputs and the outputs has to be equal. So far, simple enough.
# Mining
As a reward for successfully mining a new block, the miner is allowed to make a so-called [coinbase]( transaction that doesn't use any inputs to himself; in essence this means a miner gets to give himself a specific amount of Bitcoins. This amount is predetermined according to a formula that ensures that over time, this coinbase reward decreases and there is, ultimately, a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins in existence.

Well spotted! I guess it only counts the latest version.
@_date: 2017-04-01 08:59:13
But Segwit opens the door for better future on-chain scaling by making sighash scaling linear instead of quadratic... So it's far from the only viable method, it's the inferior method.
The complexity isn't in the change itself but rather in the technical debt it adds for future protocol changes. Honestly I'm starting to suspect that BU may be opposing Segwit because their code has diverged too much from Core and taking into account the - by now probably numerous - shortcuts and dubious design choices they have made, Segwit risks introducing incompatibilities with BU that they do not have the developer capacity to resolve.

Chainsplit. I know, pedantic, but let's please use the terminology right, the subject matter is complex enough without furthering common misunderstandings. A soft-fork and hard-fork are conceptually mutually exclusive, any type of soft-fork can never result in a hard-fork.


So this fund-stealing would only work for the duration of the non-UASF chain being the longest, and that is not likely to be a stable situation. Also, the majority of the economy would run nodes that enforce the UASF, otherwise the assumptions behind the UASF are invalid and people would not perform it.

You said "as described in the white paper" and by that you mean "the white paper didn't discuss it"? Which mental yoga class do you go to? I could do with some of that flexibility.


I'm sorry that you misunderstood my intention; I meant to make my own point and present my own view, being that of small blocks being more profitable for miners.  seems to suggest the current state of being is quite good for miners. I think that any sort of blocksize increase (even the small one from Segwit) will tank that chart.


Those are good points, and I agree with them. I'm a big blocker myself and do think that we need to scale on-chain, however I am also of the opinion that we should do such things *right* rather than *right now*; there currently are many issues with blocksize scaling such as quadratic script operation costs and quadratic signature hashing costs that need to be investigated before a long-term blocksize increase can be considered safe. (I personally would prefer a blocksize computed deterministically in the same way that e.g. the difficulty deterministically changes; I don't know how this would work but I think a system a la EC is too easily gamed by malicious actors).
@_date: 2017-04-09 23:12:18


Why don't you actually answer this?
@_date: 2017-04-06 07:08:48


I think softforks and hardforks both have their advantages and disadvantages. Some inherent (hardforks by definition drop all old nodes out of consensus and therefore either need to be *really* well-planned or a last-resort emergency measure), some because of the current state of the art (we don't yet have the mechanisms to coordinate hardforks well). In the case of non-contentious bugfixes/upgrades to the protocol I see no reason not to use softforks.
The discussion doesn't really get interesting until we are talking about a contentious fork or multiple competing incompatible forks.


I don't think that "the invisible hand of ~~god~~ the market" is a viable governance model. The market follows a well-functioning system, it does not lead it. "The market" is also notorious for its short-sightedness and nose for immediate financial gain while in Bitcoin the decisions that are taken will - hopefully - have to be supported for a very long time. The idea of Bitcoin is to trap financial greed and put it in front of a carriage chasing a golden carrot, not let financial greed design the carriage.






Honestly, I don't think miners should be in charge. I think miners are an artifact of hardware optimization that weren't predicted by Satoshi; Bitcoin was never meant to have them. IMHO, ASIC-powered miners *undermine* the mechanisms of decentralization that Satoshi proposed (1 CPU 1 vote). Letting miners be in charge of e.g. protocol changes that take power away from them/decentralize mining is like having Turkeys voting for Christmas (not my comparison, but damn if it isn't a good one).
Again the idea of letting financial greed design the carriage. Sure, miners should have a say but this separation between miners and non-mining users is causing friction between incentives. Ideally, mining should be viable - even if not profitable - for everyone so that the divide between hashpower majority and economic majority can be gotten rid of (I know, economic majority is a shitty as fuck term with no strong metric like hashpower behind it, but I really, honestly don't think that Segwit is that controversial aside from a hashpower minority veto'ing it).
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:00:36


I'm frightened of the fact that, as opposed to the situation as presented in Satoshi's whitepaper, users are pushed out of the process of validating transactions by the advancement of specialized mining hardware. The times of "one CPU one vote" are gone. I'm starting to get more and more attracted to the idea of a switch to ASIC-resistant PoW to counter mining centralization.

There is certainly a fork in the road coming up, and I think that it is a very reasonable realization that Satoshi was not a prophet; simply a man with a good understanding of different technologies and the right idea of how to put them together. An inventor.
In the software development industry, more and more focus goes towards iterative development; have an idea, implement it, test it, re-evaluate your idea, repeat. Those putting "Satoshi's vision" on a pedestal turn a 9-year old idea into gospel and will inevitably be left behind. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 07:45:28
The reasoning that I thought it would be fine is that it would only be an anyone-can-spend for pre-segwit rules. Since segwit TXes would only start happening after segwit activation, which would require miners to signal segwit readiness, I thought that it would be on miners to setup a border node to prevent issues like this. So that's why I figured it wouldn't be a practical problem/bitcoin wouldn't be broken.
And I do question them, it's an open source project, those thrive on criticisim and questioning and reassessment.

@_date: 2017-04-09 12:43:09
Not entirely accurate. It needs 95% of blocks in a 2016-block "period" to signal Segwit. Normally, this would be equal to ~95% of miners due to how statistical probability works, but with UASF this is fundamentally not true.
Nodes that run UASF reject all non-Segwit-signalling blocks between August 1 and November 15 (the deadline for activating Segwit). This means that during that period, any non-compliant blocks are not counted to the 2016-block total. So, what is expected is that either Segwit will activate with 100% signalling rate, or ~~after November 15 a massive reorganization of 3.5 months happens for the UASF nodes~~ the UASF chain dies off with a lack of hashpower.
There's 3.5 months = ~15 weeks to get "2 weeks worth" of blocks, so even with as low as ~13% hashrate supporting the UASF chain it'll activate Segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:40:43
No, because if the majority of exchanges, businesses and users refuse to recognize the non-SW blocks, while (almost) the whole network would recognize the SW blocks, this would give great incentive to the miners to focus their hashpower on mining SW blocks.

Sure they have been broken but more in the sense that it's possible to find collisions in far fewer attempts than normal. You'd still have to modify the data for every attempt which would be relatively obvious in a document with a strict format.

@_date: 2017-04-01 17:03:23
Yeah, but what miner, exactly, would mine on top of a block that just stole all the miner's rewards, except for the miner who mined the stealing block?
Maybe someone could run some calculations if there's a scenario in which it'd be profitable for a 51% miner cabal to hardfork to BU to steal miner fees rather than just keep mining on the SW chain.
Then again, in such a case, clearly Nakamoto's assumption of "hashpower majority acting honestly" would be broken and there would be no valid chain anymore.

I don't see exactly how; the majority of TXes will be on the scale of daily purchases, which will something most LN nodes will be able to handle easily. Buying a car through LN might not be so easy but hell, you can afford an on-chain fee for that. And say that your average LN node has 4 channels open, it can charge a relatively higher fee to relay a payment that increases "unbalance" in its channels and offer a discount on payments that decrease "unbalance" to avoid having to close a channel. This kind of incentivization structure will increase the mesh-ness of the LN (rather than hub-and-spoke model) and might "soften up" the centralizing effect.


You what now?
@_date: 2017-04-18 08:54:23
Fees in bitcoin are based on how "complicated" your transaction is. E.g. if you buy a lot of small coins then it costs more to send them than if you buy 1 big coin (Segwit promises to give discounts on combining coins but it would still be more expensive). For a basic transaction you can expect to spend half a USD right now if there is urgency behind it. If it's okay if the transaction takes longer then you can make the fee lower.

That's more of a "stretching out the old hardcap" since it's backwards compatible with 1mb legacy nodes. Means it's possible to squeeze some extra TX capacity out of the old hardcap without hardforking.
On the other hand, BU removes the block size hardcap entirely, which is not backwards compatible and therefore a hardfork, while at the same time introducing a new TX size hardcap that would require another hardfork to fix.
Especially when you consider that for privacy and fungibility reasons you kinda want big TXes (see: coinjoin+joinmarket, mimblewimble), I'd rather fix the TX size scaling issues before hardforking a block size increase. Let's futureproof that shit, yo.
@_date: 2017-04-05 06:54:20
SW as far as I can see is already "worked out properly". It's just a minority of the miners that is vetoing it because they have their eyes set on other options that stand to make them more powerful.

Just because something **is**, doesn't mean it **should be** or even **will be**.


This kind of non-argument I see a lot in religious people. I'm sorry but in the same way that "everything is as God wills it" is the perfect excuse for doing whatever the fuck you want cause lol it's God's fault, "natural incentives" are what drive me to be in favour of the idea of e.g. a PoW change if the miners don't get their heads out of their asses.


Not so much subservient to me or other non-miners, but rather subservient to the whole of Bitcoin. The nature of the relationship of miners &lt;-&gt; non-miners is such that miners provide a service (mining) and get rewarded for it - this reward comes from the whole of the network but net speaking from the part of the network that doesn't mine. If they do it in a way that is incompatible with my interests as a non-miner, then why would I partake in a system that allows them to continue this behaviour?


I am for the sake of simplicity assuming that you have derived Nakamoto Consensus from the last sentence in the whitepaper. A shift has occurred in the Bitcoin landscape between the "laying of the fundament" of the whitepaper and now. This shift is the splitting off of miners from users. Incentives are misaligned. We see this in the friction, the tension, the constant shitstorms. "Nakamoto Consensus" now prioritizes one subgroup's interests over those of the others. It is, by itself, not a viable governance model.


What could possibly be "natural" in an artificial system?

No, I mean, the binary could be modified with malicious code in such a way that it creates an md5 collision with the legit binary. Everyone would sign the legit md5 hash but you could still ship a compromised binary that way.

I was skeptical of it. The reference implementation had some bugs, I think they may be resolved now? Not sure. was the one who found them, maybe he has checked that the new version contains no bugs.
Proper distribution [is still being worked on]( Of course you can compile and run it yourself if you want. The more I analyze the game theory, though, the more I am convinced that it will work. [See this thread](
I've been anti-BU since I read about their proposal; just not too sure on the way to resolve the issue. Was kind of in favor of Segwit2MB but I realized that I'd rather have a well-planned hardfork further down the line that includes more improvements than just a one-off blocksize bump.
So yes, I'm pretty sure that SW+UASF is the way forward.

I assume you are talking about


First of all I'd like to point out that "core design" does not necessarily entail backwards compatibility. For example, I consider the specific hash function used in the PoW algorithm (SHA256) to be a modular part of Bitcoin, to be replaced when SHA256 becomes cryptographically broken or otherwise unsuitable for its intended purpose.
Secondly, you have activated my trap card; that post specifically talks about version 0.1. Bitcoin v0.1 was released [8 Jan 2009]( The 1MB cap was added [15 July 2010]( So, technically speaking BU is backwards compatible with "the reference version".

What you (and your dad) need to know about safely holding a Bitcoin:
* The Bitcoin blockchain is nothing more than a public transaction log.
* A Bitcoin is nothing more than the "to" part of a transaction that is recorded on the blockchain. (Miners are allowed to create a transaction without any "from" parts as their reward).
* Because of fancy technomagic called cryptography, the "to" part of a transaction essentially pays into a locked box (technical term is "public key") that can only be opened with the corresponding "private" key.
* The only way you can keep your Bitcoin secure without trusting anyone, is by keeping control over these private keys yourself.
* Nobody besides yourself should ever know these private keys. If someone hands you a private key that they have created, don't trust it as they know it and can spend any Bitcoins received to the corresponding public key.
My guess is that this guy is not going to hand over the Bitcoins, but try and trick your dad into thinking he did (possibly by giving him a private key that the guy knows).

And then the miner mines nonfull blocks when there is a backlog of lower fee TXes, and the next miner makes a full block with those lower fee TXes that ends up bringing more overall income for the block and laughs at the foolish miner who was too good for the lower fee TXes.

No, it's not. That sentence "The PRE_LOCK_IN phase allows optional per deployment processing, e.g. mandatory signalling." is copied verbatim from the BIP page.
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:20:29
Youre calculating wrong way around, its 20-30% less work so only 70-80% of hash calculations for a block are necessary.
    .4 / .7 = .57
But then total hashpower is
    .57 + .6 = 1.17 * old total
So you get
    .57 / 1.17 = .49
For a 30% efficiency boost. For 20% its:
    .4 / .8 = .5
    .5 / 1.1 = .45

Not sure about that first part. Last part is untrue, the efficiency gain is known as AsicBoost and is basically an optimization in terms of block generation so that previous hash calculations can be reused for later blocks. This puts certain restrictions on the block , there's talk about shuffling around TXes within a block but Greg's mail talks primarily about empty blocks.

Nope, although from the discussions I've taken part in and read up on over the past few days I've come to the conclusion that to be "worth it" a hardfork would have to include more than just a block size limit increase, since they are a bitch to arrange (what with companies now relying on Bitcoin to run smoothly), so it'd be better to immediately introduce a bunch of things that are on the hardfork wishlist.

Actually, UASF is about making Segwit happen with 100% activation threshold by rejecting all non-signalling blocks as invalid. So it's more that "it's improbable that miners will signal for Segwit without additional motivation".
In a way, UASF is about making miners economically incentivized to signal for Segwit because if they don't, they risk burning their hashrate on a doomed chain. Just a little nuance there ;)

By the way, the whole argument against doing Segwit first, HF blocksize increase later is that Segwit makes those later HF blocksize increases more safe. So the best thing you can do for 2mb of non-witness data is to argue for introduction of Segwit.

Makes sense, I think a lot of people are eager to run real UASF. Just wait for a deterministically-built binary that's signed by someone you trust.
If you're not familiar, deterministic building is a way to remove environment variables from affecting compilation. Was designed as a way to counter compromised compiler software adding backdoors during the compilation process but it also works more generally to counter single-point-of-trust-failure by having different people verify the build, because the resulting binaries should be bit-for-bit identical.
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:23:18


May be so, but I think that's a poor reason not to do something about the situation where right now you need a $2000 investment to break even in ~200 days, assuming free electricity and no difficulty increase, and any less of a commitment being practically useless.


In the current situation, for sure. It would have to happen eventually anyway, though; SHA256 won't be viable forever. I think that the PoW algorithm was always supposed to be a modular component of Bitcoin. Otherwise quantum computing would snap it in two.
Much in the same way as that a hardforked blocksize increase will have to happen eventually, actually.

Considering how Bitmain failed to deliver litecoin miners to their customers and instead chose to (let their associates) jump into litecoin mining on a massive scale just when Segwit was looking likely to activate there (~ 80% hashrate out of a required 75%), this really does seem like a likely scenario.

The situation you describe is very different. Although I **would** consider that an optimization, people seem to make the mistaken assumption that an optimization is always a desirable quality. Most definitely making PoW O(1) complexity as you describe would be something that should be fixed regardless of patent.

There is no "core team". There are currently features part of the Bitcoin protocol that were contributed by people with no prior association to any group of developers, that were made part of the Core software because they were good ideas.
It's kind of funny, all changes to Bitcoin get retroactively ascribed to "the Core devs", even when they weren't invented by any regular contributor to Core at all. And then "Core" gets "called out" on keeping a monopoly position on protocol development, while they have accepted and adopted many community changes.
Hell, even now I see people blame "Core" for the BIP148-UASF proposal, when it is was put forward by someone who has nothing to do with Core, and even publicly "disowned" by @_date: 2017-04-01 12:30:47

@_date: 2017-04-20 10:45:32
I consider myself a big blocker, but I also see there are significant issues with blocksize scaling currently; quadratic signature hashing, [Sergio's recent quadratic script findings]( NB: the latter is not enabled by Segwit but Segwit does make it worse due to it allowing for bigger scripts - in my understanding a side effect of Segwit's block size increase.
Before a structural increase in block size can be introduced, these issues need to be addressed; allowing block size increase now is just begging for an attacker to rent some hashrate and create a malicious block to fuck up the network. Instead of hammering on about "Core" not delivering the requested block size increase and them being assholes for it, maybe ask **why** some of the more prominent Core contributors are not, and you might find yourself actually agreeing with them. I did.

This is the same kind of "what if" as "what if a majority of users start mining and running nodes that raise the coin cap from 21 million to infinity?". Useless to speculate about, because it's not going to happen, because it breaks Bitcoin as a system by invalidating its rules.

TL;DR: It's a generalized version of BIP9 that includes BIP148 functionality.
* Starts at a certain time, stops at a certain time.
* Locks in at 95% block signal rate over a 2016-block period.
* After locking in, proposal activates.
* If not locked in by stop time, proposal activation times out.
* Starts at a certain time, stops at a certain time.
* Orphans all non-signalling blocks.
* Causes activation threshold of a pre-existing BIP9 instance to trigger.
* All of BIP9's properties **but also:**
* Has optional "mandatory lock-in" time
* If not locked-in by mandatory lock-in time, goes to PRE_LOCK_IN phase
* The PRE_LOCK_IN phase allows optional per deployment processing, e.g. mandatory signalling. (BIP148-esque)
* After PRE_LOCK_IN phase, goes to LOCKED_IN
Seems like a good candidate for introducing a fix for covert ASICboost.

Because it was a terrible bug report. Even if the github repo was being used as a way to gather feedback/take in bug reports (which it wasn't, the author of issue 7 opened issues 1-6 on the same day and aside for issue 2, which was closed a month later without comment, none of them received a reaction), that bug report did not enclose enough info to do *anything* with aside from ask for more info.

At the start of the activation period Segwit signallig was at ~80%. Then suddenly, Jihan-friendly hashrate skyrocketed (presumably using delayed-shipping antminers) to drop the signalling rate wayy down. Took a roundtable consensus where Charlie Lee had to effectively censor himself under coercion (promise not to advocate for UASF) to get the miners to activate Segwit.
[More reading if you're interested](
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:37:41
Consensus rules are enforced by hashpower. If 51% of hashpower or more starts enforcing different rules then suddenly the longest chain isn't the one you're on anymore. This is what a hard-fork is; the difference between a clean hard-fork and a "miner attack" is whether there is consensus in the community about switching to the new rules. BU as it stands would be a contentious hard-fork.
Now, the big mistake the BU-supporters make in their logic is assuming that the longest chain must be the valid one. This isn't true even by Satoshi's standards; if more than 50% of hashpower enforces rules that the userbase doesn't agree with, then Satoshi's assumption of "hashpower acting honestly" breaks down and *there is no valid chain* anymore.
Hypothetically speaking, you could enforce a contentious hard-fork with as low as 67% of hashpower; use 33.5% on your hard-fork chain, and use 33.5% to mine empty blocks in the non-fork chain, where the remaining 33% of hashpower can't compete.
Of course, this would mean that the honest userbase would switch up the PoW algorithm so that those dishonest miners lose their hashpower advantage. I'm wondering if there's a way to defend against such an attack without a PoW switch, but probably not.

I'll try to keep things "in plain language" but as a software engineer I might tend to make logical jumps that seem plain to me but aren't to someone in another field. If anything is unclear, do ask.
Satoshi Nakamoto's original reasoning was that the system of Bitcoin should be kept fair by virtue of people "voting" for the "most valid block" with their CPU power by mining on top of it. Mining being the process of extending the blockchain. Since technological advances have shifted Bitcoin mining away from CPUs, via GPUs and FPGAs to the current state of the art, ASICs, this CPU-power as it was originally called is now known as hashpower, referring to the amount of "hashes" you can calculate per second. (Mining a block is basically the process of calculating a new hash over and over and over until you find one that satisfies the current rules of the blockchain; the rules getting stricter over time as global hashpower increases to keep the average time it takes to find a block at 10 minutes).
Now... Segwit is a quite clever advancement in Bitcoin technology that A) allows 2nd-layer technologies such as Lightning Network that greatly magnify Bitcoin's ability to scale (allowing instantly verified payments and greatly increasing throughput of value especially in the micropayment domain) and B) through sheer genius on the Core devs' part, can be introduced in a way that does not break backwards compatibility with the old consensus rules of the Bitcoin network. This B) part is referred to when people call it a soft-fork; as opposed to a hard-fork that requires EVERYONE to start applying new rules at the same time or be unable to follow the blockchain.
However, Segwit does require a majority in hashpower to activate, as it introduces new rules for how blocks are structured; naturally the miners who create these blocks must follow these rules. To ensure stability the Core developers have set a 95% hashpower support minimum before Segwit is activated (95% of the last X amount of blocks must be stating support of Segwit for it to trigger). This isn't currently happening, is taking far longer than promised by the miners and the people who want to start using the new tech that Segwit enables (notably, many exchanges and businesses) are getting fed up.
UASF is a user-activated soft-fork; instead of **passively** waiting for miners to pledge the supermajority of hashpower to mining Segwit blocks, UASF proposes that non-mining users running fully-validating nodes reject all ~~non-Segwit~~ blocks **not signalling readiness to introduce Segwit** in ~~a certain~~ **the timeperiod just before the deadline to activate Segwit** to motivate miners to ~~start mining Segwit blocks~~ **pledge hashpower to introducing Segwit**.

No, he meant that OP's TX probably had a lot of inputs (possibly sweeping some dust TXOs), which increases the size of the TX in kb and therefore the fee.
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:11:40
Why do you not care whether something that is attributed to someone is something they said or not? If only logical merit matters then why even attribute statements to identities?
I have a problem with the statements in the OP pic, supposedly made by Antonopolous, and I valued Antonopolous above making those kinds of statements. If they turn out to be made by him, my opinion of him will go down.

I'm not really trying to start a conversation speculating about what miners might be thinking; I'd like to discuss actual arguments instead of might-bes. If this is what *you* think I'd like to explore them with you, but not if you are setting yourself up for a "I don't know man, just saying it's possible they think this and that". That said, here's my thoughts about your points.


I don't remember anything about block size in the whitepaper, could you point me to it?


If miners are worried about loss of fee income the worst they could do is allow scaling solutions, true; the more rare the supply of blockspace is vs. the demand of it, the better off they are because fees will continue to rise. I'm not entirely sure on what you are saying about the "centralization hazards" or impact on incentive structure, though, could you expand on that a bit?


Why wouldn't they want that?
@_date: 2017-04-09 08:46:12

@_date: 2017-04-05 06:27:33


I am the person who decides what logic I consider viable, yes.


Please point out where my usage of the definitions conflicts with yours.


This is actually what I think, too. In other words, this is not in conflict with my logic at all, in fact, it is in line with it. This is, however, in conflict with statements that Bitcoin is how Satoshi coded it and that BU would not be Bitcoin because it constitutes a hardfork.
But, to examine your definitions a bit further, show me how you deal with the following three curveballs:
1. Miners introduce ExtBlocks as a soft-fork. It's backwards compatible but people don't want it, or, at the very least, it's highly contentious. Core devs create a soft-fork that rejects ExtBlocks. Then what is Bitcoin?
2. UASF goes live, Jihan holds strong and orphans the Segwit-signalling chain with his own minority of hashpower. Is Jihan's version Bitcoin?
3. Core devs have had enough with Jihan's shenanigans and switch to ASIC-resistant PoW through a hard-fork. The community largely follows the Core devs and updates, mining goes back to GPU-level and is decentralized again. The old miners of course can't, so they keep the old chain alive. Then which should we call Bitcoin?

You're right, thanks for pointing it out to me.
@_date: 2017-04-20 10:20:15


The bigger the peels of the nuts, the closer they get to the 4x mutiplier. Switching away from the nut analogy; the witness data of a TX is mostly determined by its inputs. The more inputs a TX has, the bigger the witness data required. Outputs don't suffer from this "penalty". However, in terms of their effect on the UTXO set, outputs are far worse for resource usage (because UTXO is preferably kept in RAM for performance reasons). So the status quo penalizes TXes that decrease UTXO (# of inputs &gt; # of outputs). By discounting the witness data this is partially corrected (not completely as making the witness data free would just make it spam central).


Depends, pruned nodes can discard old bags. Full-archive nodes will, yes.


All the peels, obviously. That's not a very likely scenario though. What info would be lost if at 1 point all the bitcoin nodes that contain all the bags go offline? That'd be fucked, yeah. This is why we need decentralization.
@_date: 2017-04-14 20:54:13
Seems I was mistaken in my understanding of how segwit outputs were interpreted by pre-segwit software. The misunderstanding was "allowed" to exist in my head by the fact that people talking about backwards compatibility of segwit usually explain that pre-segwit nodes would not verify segwit TXes because they were missing data/understanding of the data structure, but the idea that they could still "know" there was something funky going on (ie. them being non-standard) was never focused on. Thanks for clearing up that confusion.

@_date: 2017-04-30 09:44:25
I'd like to point out a couple of flaws to post here:
A soft fork is backwards compatible, this means that old software keeps working, whereas a hard fork is not backwards compatible, this means that legacy software "drops out of consensus".
The 95% number behind BIP9-style softfork activation is in terms of hashrate, not in terms of client software/economic nodes. The difference is that miners can be expected to be far more on the cutting edge of the tech than your local shopkeeper who offers Bitcoin payments. Saying we can just do a hardfork if we have 95% consensus is therefore an oversimplification that does not hold true.
In any case, as far as I understand it the only differences between Segwit-as-a-hardfork and Segwit-as-a-softfork are the block weighting (which actually has its own benefits) and the fact that originally (in the HF design) there was a change to the header (which made it backwards-incompatible), but it was discovered that by moving this change to the coinbase transaction, it could be made compatible with legacy clients.
Those points about niggling malleability cases and the addressing format changing are therefore not relevant to the hardfork/softfork comparison.
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:36:14
Wrong. Their AsicBoost only gives them an efficiency advantage on mining ~~empty blocks~~ blocks with a certain structure. When mining Segwit, this efficiency advantage goes away, but the vast majority of their hashpower stays in the game. It's only ~20% of their AsicBoost-enabled miners' hashpower that evaporates, which is probably a tiny fraction of their total hashpower.
@_date: 2017-04-03 22:20:01
Yep. Wouldn't need things like joinmarket for fungibility anymore.
@_date: 2017-04-12 21:19:27
Of course, as an attacker you'd pick the format most convenient for generating collisions, because you could presumably claim "oh yeah that hash totally belonged to a PDF".
@_date: 2017-04-04 06:23:52
Actually, that's false. Going from post-Segwit-activation to pre-Segwit behavior is a hard fork, because that constitutes a loosening of the rules. Once Segwit goes live there is no going back without a hard fork; **actually** once Segwit signalling hits the "95% of 2016 blocks" sucessfully there is no going back without a hard fork.
The game theory that makes UASF strong is that it would be economic suicide for miners to attempt orphaning the Segwit-signalling blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-03 20:03:41
There is a solid deadline on Segwit activation; if it is not activated before 15 november, the activation fails and it is back to the drawing board. There is no sense in waiting for a certain signal level; UASF is designed to put pressure on miners to signal.
@_date: 2017-04-24 12:06:03
I've asked many times but have yet to come across a convincing argument against segwit. I mean, beyond the "covert asicboost" and "full blocks are more profitable for miners so stalling is in their own best interest" ones that don't work in the miners' favor from my perspective as a non-mining user.
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:58:17
Cool, glad to help :)
Still though, I see a use for the PRE_LOCK_IN phase even if not used for forced signalling; e.g. to give miners a little bit of extra time to upgrade in case of a timeout-activation (where a threshold-activation would trigger the ACTIVE state sooner). Why do you prefer the "non-strong" version?

No, it's fundamentally different. The situation you describe breaks the Poisson-distribution quality of the mining process, whereas AB doesn't.


This is true, but for different reasons than the instant-mining-algo you described. If AB was freely available to/usable by everyone (ie. not patent-protected) it wouldn't be so much of a problem. If covert AB didn't block protocol changes it wouldn't be so much of a problem. As it is currently, Segwit is an effective PoW change from the perspective of covert-AB-enabled miners, which gives them incentive to block it.


I never disagreed with this. It's cheating in a way, but not inherently detrimental to the network. It's the context (patent, blocking protocol changes) that make it problematic, not the power-saving itself.


Yep, you definitely got that right. Greg's BIP proposal is genius in a way, it completely corners Jihan. He can't directly oppose it in any logical way or implicitly admit using/planning to use covert AB. His only tactic is to throw up shitstorms about different things and hope it distracts from introducing that BIP.

I'm subscribed to/active in both subs as well, and I do think it's good to challenge your own views and perspectives by talking to people who are on the other side of an argument. It's a complex topic and I don't fully consider myself on either side of a singular fence.
That said, most anti-Core arguments are rather weak (or they are strong arguments to be against something but just don't apply to Core). I'm personally not pro-Core in the sense that "Core can do no wrong" (there's plenty to criticize Core on), but so far Core has been putting forward the best solutions and provided the best arguments from a technical perspective. And to me, technical soundness matters more than e.g. emotional rhetoric and social smoothness (which some people outside of Core excel in far more).

ExtBlock size is unknown (To Be Determined). Might be smaller than Segwit, might be much bigger. Seems designed to be able to get more extensions tacked on at any moment the miners decide it. In any case these ExtBlocks centralize mining in exactly the same way as bigger blocks do.
@_date: 2017-04-05 16:53:38
The ExtBlock softfork could hypothetically be introduced by miners and be backwards compatible with your full node, following the same consensus rules (actually a stricter set). It would make your full node less secure than a current-day SPV client.
And on the other hand hashpower used to perform Gavin's empty-block DoS is also following the same consensus rules (actually a stricter set). Both are effectively soft-forks.
So. That of them.

You might be in the wrong place, we talk about cryptocurrencies (well, specifically, Bitcoin) here...

Ahh, no, you misunderstand my point. My point was that to a non-AB miner making Segwit blocks would be more profitable (but not mandatory), so the only explanation for mining non-Segwit blocks after SW activation would be:
1. AsicBoost shifting the profitability in favor of legacy blocks.
2. Miner being stupid.
Assuming that miners aren't stupid (although recent ViaBTC tweets seem to indicate differently) this means that effectively, activating Segwit removes the possibility of covert AsicBoost, as AsicBoost-miners would become obvious in the sense that they are letting bigger fees go by unclaimed.

Sorry, I meant to reply to this point more directly in my previous reaction but apparently forgot to.
As [seen in discusison on the dev mailing list]( the bitcrust creator actually acknowledges that his implementation also scales up in resource cost with UTXO-set size, and that there is strong reason to believe that this is not implementation-specific but rather universally true.

Not all UASFs (specifically, not BIP148), although you are right, I incorrectly interpreted this as being about BIP148, my bad.

UASF can't be "forced", much like how MASF (miner-activated soft-fork) can't be forced. Yes, businesses and exchanges will play a vital role in the success or failure of UASF. Many have already rejected BU and are advocating for Segwit ([see here]( I'm not sure if any have made any statement about UASF.
@_date: 2017-04-03 22:01:30
You're misunderstanding UASF. The only thing UASF does is make it economically necessary for miners to signal for Segwit activation. The actual activation of Segwit happens later.

Just because a majority of the market is in favor of something doesn't mean we should have decision making/governance implemented in this "codeified market mechanics" kind of way, with people "voting" by investing in something. That leads to Bitcoin's future being decided by Wall Street types.


No. They are hired to do a specific job, if they want to change the parameters of that job it should happen in negotiation with their client. Construction companies changing the materials of the build without consulting the architect are held liable for structural weaknesses that result; in Bitcoin that's not an option so we need to be more proactive about countering it. And we can do better in terms of having tools than somehow using the market as a tool. Maxwell's BIP to disable covert AsicBoost is exactly such a tool.

@_date: 2017-04-04 22:05:19
Right... I just don't think that Bitcoin has to be backwards compatible with the latest iteration that Satoshi published (or any, for that matter). That would mean that any hardfork, even a non-contentious one, would create not-Bitcoin and I don't consider that a viable logic.
As a trivial example; we will eventually change the PoW algorithm, when SHA256 becomes too cryptographically weak to keep Bitcoin secure. This will necessarily be a hardfork. If that happens in a non-contentious, well-planned, well-executed way, then everyone will still call the result "Bitcoin".

Right. I meant more that it is a framework that allows for BIP148-like activation logic. Forced readiness signalling means miners have to do *something* in response to get paid, rather than be passive ~~and potentially cause a chainsplit at some unknown later date a la BIP66~~.
Edit: actually BIP66 chainsplit happened after a successful 95% activation so obviously forced signalling wouldn't help much there.

They (purse) are funded by Roger's fund so it's either complicity or a naive lack of paranoia on and part. For sure they gobbled up the anti-SW propaganda; see [this post for example](


Big question is whether they support this view because they believe it or because their motives are being "lubricated". I think we should give them some credit and the benefit of doubt for the time being; they are young and perhaps this has been a good lesson for them to be more critical and paranoid of the incentives of those around them.
It all imho boils down to this; they claim compatibility with BIP0141 (Segwit) but while their ExtBlocks have compatibility with Segwit-type of TXes, their proposal is incompatible with the specific implementation of Segwit as per BIP0141. Seemingly, it is this incompatibility with BIP0141 that lends their proposal compatibility with ASICboost.
I wonder if the [dev list discussion]( where Christopher proposed some changes to the ExtBlock spec and code would break ASICboost compatibility. If it does I think it's fair to assume they - or at least Christopher - were not aware of the Segwit vs Extblocks considerations from the ASICboost perspective themselves and had someone guiding their actions away from breaking ASICboost, since these posts were made before Greg dropped his bomb.

Miners can never unilaterally decide fees, that's never how Bitcoin has worked. TX creators can *offer* fees, and then miners choose from among the offers which ones they fill a block with. That is how the fee market is created. Fees didn't, don't, and never will get "set" or "configured" by miners.
@_date: 2017-04-21 11:36:31
Yeah, there's some devlist discussion about TX voting but I think that's fundamentally flawed. I would totally be giving myself discounts by broadcasting my TXes multiple times (as doublespends) with low fees but voting for different things so that miners will try to mine the one TX of mine that suits their political preferences best before someone else can mine another.

Well, fucking shit, "community consensus" IS politics. Get your fucking story straight and cut the shit. Sure a HF just for blocksize may be too much fuckery for too little benefit, SO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT MORE BENEFICIAL.

LN isn't a Core thing, but it relies on Segwit which **is** a Core thing. So in that way Core has delivered, it's just being vetoed by miners who are profiting off the full blocks and high TX fees, perhaps even [shorting the coin before tweeting]( 
Segwit by itself isn't *that* complicated, most of the people claiming that haven't done their own reading. It's actually quite clever, using a relatively simple trick (separating the witness data) to give a one-off backwards-compatible blocksize bump while at the same time providing a malleability fix that is required for 2nd layer solutions like LN.
The genius of Segwit is in how it enables this to be deployed as a soft-fork. Hard-forks are going to be necessary in the future, but right now we have a solution on the table that is ready to go and doesn't require a massive amount of research, implementation, testing and verification in order to be safe, which is the current status for any hard-fork. Segwit has been studied for quite some time and is all geared up and ready to go. Blocking it now is just denying Bitcoin a scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:36:10
Measurements for that are kind of vague. Hard to CYA. Best if Core devs didn't mess with UASF. Don't touch it with a 10ft pole imho.

Appeal to authority. "It must be as it is in our holy writ." Classic tactic used for milennia by institutionalized religion. Don't buy into it.


Actually 2nd layer solutions aim to take pressure off the blockchain so that TX counts and, by extent, fees can go down.


Segwit does not make TXes unreliable. The EB/AD mechanism as proposed by BU and Classic DOES make TXes unreliable as it effectively functions based on unpredictable hardforks.


Appeal to ignorance. This is a cryptocurrency for fuck's sake. If learning the intricacies is too hard, then what are you doing trying to influence the design?


Or sane moderation to counter derailment of discussions. 1984 vs. Brave New World. Btw, [censors too](


"By censoring your own information sources and only reading the discussions where trolls, downvote brigades and paid shills have free reign you save us from getting our hands dirty with the nasty business of explicit censorship so we can hide behind our facade of free speech."


Spotty track record in terms of exploitable bugs.


Led by someone who doesn't even understand basic things like [what constitutes a consensus change](


Some cool devs for sure, worth watching. Shame to see them exploited for political purposes like this but that's not their fault.


When it comes to Bitcoin development, no team is more decentralized than "Core". Besides, for things like "banking software" which is what Bitcoin essentially is, you should be running good code. It's in your own best interest.


So let's stop dillydallying and delaying the activation of Segwit!


Stability and a focus on decentralization/countering centralization are rock solid design choices when it comes to software that determines how a decentralized currency works.


Bitcoin's core strength is in its decentralization, eroding that undermines its value.

A soft-fork is a tightening of the rules. A hard-fork is a loosening of the rules. In order to reverse a soft-fork you need a hard-fork. 
I am not sure at what point in time is arguing Satoshi's code was considered "the definition" of Bitcoin. If taken at an early enough time BU would be a softfork compared to that. So then, the hardfork/softfork divide is unclear how it makes SW "canonical Bitcoin" and how BU would not be considered "canonical Bitcoin".
I'm trying to figure out what he means, because I am not seeing how his definition of Bitcoin excludes BU from that label, while at the same time allowing Segwit-enabled Bitcoin to carry it.

One major advantage of Bitcoin's design, and the reason it has worked well so far, is that it economically incentivizes "good" behaviour (given certain assumptions). Miners are assumed to stay honest purely out of selfishness; if the assertion that "keeping Bitcoin secure is more profitable than attacking it" breaks, the security model of Bitcoin crumbles.
Likewise, I think designing the protocol to incentivize consolidating UTXOs is a good thing. I certainly see no advantage to the current status quo of splitting UTXOs being far cheaper than consolidating them.


Because BIP9 is not a deployment mechanism for hardforks; it's a deployment mechanism for softforks. Because if we are going to do a hardfork, I'd rather have one that enables more than just a "dumb" blocksize bump. Hardforks are relatively painful and costly, better to have something more to show for them.

Main fundamental difference between Segwit and ExtBlk that I am aware of (not talking about issues like reliability of the resolution TX that may potentially be fixed at some point - I am not too familiar with how fundamental that problem is) is that Segwit allows legacy nodes to follow all TXes, just not fully validate them (dropping fully-validating nodes to SPV status), whereas ExtBlk moves some TXes into and out of the Extension Block where legacy nodes can't follow what is going on (dropping fully-validating nodes to worse-than-SPV status).

Actually I had a very good discussion with on that on the other day, and I actually think the block weight thing is a pro, considering how it removes a de facto penalty on light-weight data.
As in, the witness data puts a lot less strain on the network than TXO data (TXO data directly bloats the UTXO set which is expensive; it can't be pruned and is preferably kept in RAM while on the other hand the witness data can be pruned and is actually a relatively big component of TXes that reduce the UTXO set), so it effectively costing the same as TXO data is a flaw in the current cost calculation.

The problem with BU is that it is a solution built on and driven by incompetence.
* Incompetent design (ping me if you need me to link to a technical analysis for why the blocksize-governing protocol as proposed by BU is fundamentally broken).
* Incompetent implementation (as evidenced by their nodes going offline all at once in a hack).
* Incompetent project management (as evidenced by the patch to the vulnerability responsible for above-mentioned hack being spread closed-source - a big no-no in open source projects).
* Incompetent political tactics (BU node counts are clearly faked to artificially inflate support, is obviously troll/shill territory; you get downvoted for politely providing logical arguments and upvoted for shitposting).
But above all...
* Incompetent user base which falls for these tricks.
As much as they have a problem with Core "making the rules" in a so-called centralized way, their proposed solutions (BU making the rules in an even more centralized way) and hammering on about how this one person who has been absent from the discourse for *years* has dispensed his infinite wisdom in holy writ (whitepaper) and holds the answers to every problem that didn't even exist yet, make it clear that they don't want decentralized development at all, or at the very least don't know what it means.
Satoshi Nakamoto is their Bitcoin God, and Roger Ver their Bitcoin Jesus (yes, they literally call him that). Just as a reminder, Ver is the man that kept reassuring everyone nothing was wrong at Mt. Gox. Are we really supposed to take such a cult seriously?

But segwit makes sighash scaling linear, which is the clearly superior way of making future block size increases viable. Working in another magic number just makes the rules needlessly complex, creating more technical debt to work around with future protocol changes.

You mean collision?
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:42:50


We don't know that there will be unanimous support but the idea of UASF is that it's not necessary. Because as a miner, you are presented with the following options:
A) Signal Segwit, have your blocks be accepted by all nodes.
B) Don't signal Segwit, have your blocks be rejected by some nodes.
The bigger the amount of nodes that reject non-SW-signalling blocks, the more reason there is for miners to signal SW.
Of course, there is also the consideration of what blocks to build on top of... If you think that non-SW-signalling blocks won't be accepted by the network, then aside from signalling SW, you should not mine on top of non-SW-signalling blocks because your subsequent blocks will be rejected. It is basically setting a deadline on miners to choose; yes or no on supporting Segwit. No troll signalling, put your money where your mouth is. Or rather, put your hashpower where your mouth is.

[What UASF does is reject all non-SW-signalling blocks between 1 August and 15 November.](

UASF doesn't change how Segwit is activated; it is still activated by the mechanism of [95% of a consecutive streak of 2016 blocks signalling specific version bits]( UASF simply coerces miners into signalling this in their blocks.

With proper miner decentralization that would not work. Granted, as it stands I see a lot of risk of this coming from China, which is why I think mining needs to be more decentralized.
I think UASF as a mechanism is not neutral, you are right; it *can* be used for the wrong things. However, its current use (BIP148) aligns with my goals, therefore I support it.

Yeah! It's totally rational for them to mine legacy blocks if they have AsicBoost. Which is **exactly** my point; if they mine legacy blocks after Segwit activates they must have some reason for it, ie. AsicBoost, and therefore it won't be so covert anymore.
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:41:04
Well I'm still reading up on all the details (and I'm sure that this will be all handled by the software so really this is only interesting from an engineering standpoint) but as I currently understand it there's 3 possible channel-closing scenarios:
1. Cooperative close: both parties agree to "part ways" and close the channel. They sign a transaction spending the channel funds (since they are tied up in a 2-of-2 multisig wallet), and the funds are spent in a normal Bitcoin TX, each output immediately reusable by the receiving party.
2. Unilateral close: one party wants to close the channel but the other party doesn't cooperate. The closing party then chooses to broadcast the latest state, dividing the funds according to this state. The funds are tied up for some specified timeout period, and the TX is more complex and therefore more expensive in fees, but each party gets their money.
3. Cheating close: like the unilateral close, except that a revoked state is published. Since the counterparty has the revocation keys which lets them immediately spend **all** TXOs from this state, they can use the timeout period mentioned in (2) to punish the cheating party by claiming all funds in the channel.
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:00:17
Actually I think this is a good question and the proper answer to it deserves to be spread. Segwit is a tightening of the rules; a transaction that is valid with Segwit is valid with the old rules but not necessarily vice-versa. This is the fundamental difference between a soft-fork (backwards compatible) versus a hard-fork (a loosening of the rules; everyone needs to update their clients to accept the new blocks that were not valid before the fork).
The fearmongering about anyone-can-spends is based on the fact that an output of a Segwit transaction looks like a Bitcoin that can be spent by *anyone* according to the old rules. However, Segwit uses its new rules to enforce that this doesn't happen. So the *only* way this can be abused, is if after we transition to Segwit and send around some Segwit transactions, we hard-fork back to pre-Segwit rules. There is no way that this will happen.

False, segwit moves only the witness data of segwit txes "out of view" of legacy nodes, extblk moves entire txes out of view.


What do you base that on? If a tx sends to a legacy address, a legacy wallet can spend it just fine, even if the tx is nonstandard; the waller assumed the miner that mined the block with the tx in it verified it.
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:31:57
Wtf is this "disgusting" sentiment, bruh. Bitcoins aren't food. Are you Trump?
That said, there's actually a really good reason for the discount; and that is that UTXOs cost disproportionally much RAM for anyone running a full node. TX cost isn't just byte for byte what goes on the network or on your hard drive, also other costs need to be taken into account.
How about instead of yelling about how "arbitrary" it is (not your words, but Jihan's) critics of the Segwit TX cost breakdown actually address the rationale behind it?

1. The difficulty readjustment mechanism is designed for difficulty increase, not decrease. It will still work if the decrease is slow and gradual, but if a large portion of hashpower leaves the system it will cause a huge delay in block times and therefore a huge delay to the readjustment moment. This is a relatively minor issue, though.
2. TX fees are an inherent part of Bitcoin design. Miners should be compensated for providing hashpower to the system. The whole security model of Bitcoin is premised on the assertion that playing fair is more profitable than attacking the system. If that assertion fails, the security model crumbles. The block-fee halvenings have been programmed in from the start; we **will** need to transition to a setup that allows miners to get their profit from TX fees alone.
3. ASICs do more hashes per unit of electric power than FPGAs, GPUs or CPUs. This kind of advantage isn't going to go away. Hell, even discussions about PoW-switches are now centered around ASIC-friendly PoW algorithms (so that figuring out how to get it working on an ASIC isn't a patentable thing).

I agree we'll need to do better, yes. Since the penalty TX allows claiming of all the funds in the channel, perhaps LN wallets can broadcast the necessary info to claim a certain % of the "leftover" funds in the channel to reward whoever publishes the penalty TX in case of cheating while the LN wallet is offline? That way you're essentially incentivizing the network to enforce the contract on your behalf.

I'd like to point out that not only is the game theory forcing miners to signal Segwit; it also forces them to refuse to build on top of non-signalling blocks, since those blocks will be rejected too. So to play it safe, not only do they have to signal themselves, they have to actively orphan non-compliant miners' blocks.
Edit: this also means that miners are encouraged to go back and mine on top of the segwit-signalling chain even after they bought into a non-segwit-signalling chain if the SW-signalling chain starts getting more and more steam. Of course, the more hashpower they invest in the other chain the more they will have wasted it.

Oh and re: your comparison of LN and BTC txes, I'd add that LN is secured by someone being online to create and broadcast the penalty TX in time in case of cheating. I'm sure that there is going to be some workaround for that eventually, but afaik that's still an unsolved UX issue.

What the hell are you talking about? The **unencrypted/decrypted private keys** would touch that VPS. Every time a LN node forwards a transaction, it needs the **unencrypted** private keys to do so. Every time any wallet software creates a transaction, you need to decrypt the wallet, which then exposes the private keys to the VPS you are running the wallet on.
Even forgetting the chance of malicious VPS operators, a VPS is essentially timeshared hardware, with no control on what else runs there. What if the process isolation isn't perfect (meltdown/spectre anyone?) and another user pivots his access to the server to look into your wallet software/LN node's memory space?
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:54:20
BIP148 forces signalling and causes orphaning of any non-signalling blocks. This is quite strong-arm-y towards miners. "Signal what we say or lose your income." On the other hand, this uaversionbits proposal, while it *allows* for BIP148-esque forced signalling, does not necessarily include it.
Without the forced signalling, mandatory lock-in "only" poses a danger in the sense of BIP66-esque chainsplits. The BIP66 chainsplit happened after a 95%-threshold activation, so even forced signalling won't prevent that, especially considering the economic incentive to say "yes" no matter if you mean "yes" to someone threatening you.

It *is* an attack because there has been intentional and deliberate refusal to provide mechanisms to ensure there is no conflict. So far I've seen all of the following suggestions being shot down on the BTC1 issue tracker:
- Strong 2-way replay protection
- Non-conflicting network magic
- Non-conflicting addresses
All in the name of compatibility, while at the same time pushing for an explicitly incompatible hard-fork. And then when the Core P2P logic was changed to disconnect from S2X nodes, to improve a more gradual network split (and not just a massive fallout as the network suddenly partitions come hardforkday), Jeff had a huge tantrum about it. Sad.

You sorted the contributors by commits and then only started outputting when they cumulatively reached &gt;50% of commits - if the first half contained any corporate-funded commits you did not count them, as evidenced by the fact that you didn't show yours nor instagibbs'. Oh by the way, you added those together, since you only looked at first names.

Your LN node will need to hold an amount of BTC - it can't even forward a payment without signing txes (just skips the "publish on blockchain" step) so it will control the private keys to the amount of BTC you allocate it. And yes, every channel open/close is an onchain TX for which you will pay onchain fees, but presumably you don't care so much about expediency/can just let them confirm whenever the mempools are low.

LN is nothing like a fractional reserve, since all bitcoins usable within LN are fully committed. In LN there is near-zero counterparty risk so the improved "reliability" of big hubs is negligible.
You seem to have seriously misinformed yourself and bought into some untruthful FUD.

I personally suspect that they have simply failed to upgrade to segwit. Perhaps his CTO, could clarify?
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:52:20
I don't use Ledger but that seems weird to me; the current most-work chain is compatible with the BIP148 ruleset (which is the technical term for what most people refer to as UASF) and there is no risk of a future chainsplit as the BIP148 rules have already deactivated (they were only used to activate segwit). If you have Bitcoin, you have UASF-Bitcoin, as there was no chainsplit.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:30:17
Well I haven't tested it but I've poked around the code and talked to the devs, hence estimation and not experience ;).
LN nodes will automatically open channels with other LN nodes (so-called autopilot mode) to ensure you don't rely on a single counterparty. This has as a side-benefit the network is well-connected, ie. that for every route through any (big) node, there will be many routes that don't go through it, which means that you will be able to route your payments even if Starbucks' node goes down.

Thing is, if your node is running remotely (on someone else's machine) you need to be very careful how you use it. You certainly can't let it handle your private keys, though you could use it as the backend node for a lightweight wallet.

You solve more blockhashes with the same amount of computation power, because you can reuse some of the partial hashes. This means that you are right (you do not do the hashing operation more often ie. don't get extra hashing power) but at the same time OP is right (you do solve more blockhashes with the same hardware in the same time with the same amount of electricity, ie. you do get extra hashing power).
@_date: 2018-03-29 18:23:27
Well, no, nothing of that nature has been implemented (because obviously devs aren't going to focus on that until it becomes relevant when there are far more relevant problems to solve), but I'm talking hypothetically here.
Hypothetically you could follow both chains after the fork in a similar manner to how cross-chain atomic swaps need a LN node that is aware of multiple blockchains. What you would need to do is, before the chain forks, generate two "states"; a primary state that is valid on the current chain and the post-fork chain that follows current rules (but not on the chain with the new rules), and a shadow state that is valid on the post-fork chain that follows the new rules (but not on the current chain or the post-fork chain that follows the current rules). These states should have distinct revocation secrets.
Both of these parallel states would need to be revoked every time such a channel is updated before the fork, but AFTER the fork, these channels are essentially two channels on the different chains, and should be treated individually.
If you have a channel with a channel partner that does not run a version of LN that is capable of doing this (or she does and you don't want to run it yourself), the channel should be closed BEFORE the fork occurs.

Thank you for wording this so well. I also don't oppose bigger blocks, hell, I think that S2X is being silly only allowing for a 2X bump. Seems stupid to me to replace one static hardcap with another, at the full cost of a hardfork (which are a huge pain in the ass in a distributed system like this). And then they proceed to route around the experts, refuse to provide anti-disruption mechanisms and even sabotage the more gradual P2P reorganization introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.15 after a lot of miners were forced to deal with P2P drama around the B\*Cash fork.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:21:17
It is a consensus-layer change that loosens the rules; this is a hardfork. Just because the term is overloaded (ie. there are other uses for the same term) doesn't mean my usage of it is invalid.

Eh, there was no release with the blacklist thing, so I suppose it doesn't count as an actual hardfork. Still though, people were talking about it so much and designing anti-replay/splitting solutions around it that it's very bad form to revert it.
In a way I'm glad they did considering all the problems, but on the other hand I also think that this yolo approach to consensus layer code really spells doom for the project.

Engineers are hard at work to implement mechanisms to improve the ways LN routes around any failing nodes. There's always going to be bigger and smaller nodes - some people will just not have as much funds as others - but central failure points will not be a problem in my estimation.
Also privacy-wise LN is a lot better than Bitcoin, nodes can only see which neighbour a payment comes from and which neighbour it goes to - they have no information about starting- or end-points. In other words your neighbours can't tell if a payment you route through them comes from you or from one of your other neighbours.

Hubs cant tell if a payment they forward originated from the peer they received it from or from someone further down the mesh network, so even then privacy would be fine.

Not sure exactly what you mean by "economic actor" in this context but I'll substitute "payment forwarder" and answer accordingly, since that's my best estimation of what you are talking about.
I'm not sure if it's implemented yet, but hypothetically payments could be split over many LN txes - so that you can route a payment of 10 BTC even through 0.1 BTC channels. So in my estimation even small nodes will be fine - I think efficiency of any individual node will be far more dependent on the economic activity of its neighbours (and their neighbours etc) so impossible if not insanely hard to predict.

Nope, nodes are in a P2P network, not a client/server network. Blocks are forwarded to outgoing connections as well.

You're basing that math on a bunch of assumptions that don't hold up.

* You assume that I am willing to degrade my privacy by selling my BCH where there is no joinmarket or real-world use to hide my txes in.

Are there? I'm not aware of any one that share the strong security of Bitcoin - development teams are way more centralized in altcoins and some have seen freezes or even rollbacks of their chain as their devs fixed bugs. Bitcoin also had developer centralization at the start of course, but the key takeaway from the lack of scaling problems in altcoins is the lack of scale - there are no real scaling solutions (that don't harm the security model) implemented in those altcoins (as far as I am aware).
As for scaling in Bitcoin, read up on [lightning network]( it's exciting as fuck. Of course if you're not a dev it might be difficult but then again you want to know about the future of crypto...

Not sure if you're saying "no" because you agree with me or because you don't.
But I have to disagree subtly with you - consensus rules are also "client-side" but the mechanical difference is that if you and I disagree on consensus rules then can end up on different networks. In LN, if we disagree on the upper limit of channels we are okay with having open, then we will just use the smaller of the two.

Malware is known to watch the copypaste clipboard for anything that looks like a private key, I suspect it was that (and had nothing to do with Electrum). On the other hand, MD5 is broken and should not be trusted to verify that binaries are identical. All it's good for is making sure you don't have a corrupt download, but an attacker could relatively easily create a malicious version of Electrum with the same MD5 hash as the original.

LN (Lightning Network) is a network of payment channels.
Your LN wallet (aka node) can open channels with other nodes. Let's say I have a channel with someone named Adam, and you have a channel with them as well. Then I can send some bitcoin to you through Adam, by making a smart contract with him that only pays him if he can prove he's paid you.
However, the way the contract is set up makes sure that Adam doesn't know whether the money is coming from me, or someone else that has a channel with me, or someone who has a channel open with that someone else, etc. etc. etc.
Similarly, Adam doesn't know if you're the one the money is being sent to, or someone you have a channel with, or someone "behind" them, etc.
You don't even know which node the money is coming from, you only know that Adam paid you for an invoice you sent me through a text message, an email, a webshop prompt or whatever.
Only I know the entire path of the payment, every other node only sees which neighbour the money is coming from and (unless they're you) which neighbour they are forwarding the money to.

Well one can always use cointainting techniques using post-fork mining dust to do manual replay protection, so in that sense it already was an airdrop, but yeah.
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:06:04
Hmm. In LN every "state" is nothing more than a specially crafted bitcoin transaction, that can be put on the chain in case of uncooperative counterparties. There is nothing saying that you cannot negotiate a valid post-hardfork transaction for a new state.

I expected you to bring up macaroons :) Glad you did.
Macaroons allow authentication and fine-grained authorization, however they don't help the situation that to run an actively functioning LN node, it needs to be able to generate new transactions and get them signed on-demand.
So you will need to run your own server on your own hardware that hosts the private keys, for the VPS node to interact with and get those transactions signed. So the suggestion that "just use a vps" is very dangerous, because the concepts are there, but the software to use these advanced authentication/authorization mechanisms is not yet available (please do correct me if I'm wrong here) nor will someone who hears "just use a vps" immediately know about macaroons, NOR does it free you from the burden of running your own server.

Sidechains individually suffer from the same scalability issues as the "base" blockchain, and sacrifice fungibility in order to scale. I don't know much about tangles, but I am very hesitant to assume they have the same strong security guarantees (sybil-proofness etc) as Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-04 09:59:10
The point is that there is a discrepancy in costs vs. fees in UTXOs. As in, without segwit, creating an UTXO is always cheaper than consuming it, leading to an economic incentive not to "clean up after yourself". Segwit slightly rebalances this - not explicitly so but as a beneficial side effect of the weight metric.
Nobody is talking about putting a hard limit on UTXO growth, the ideas in the air are mostly about properly aligning incentives.

You did not highlight which part you added, but I think you are talking about this:




I think you fundamentally misunderstand the nature of punishment txes in lightning - they do not "contest" the fraudulent close in the sense of doublespending it or something like that. Batching is not relevant at all. Alice simply spends Sybil's outputs from the fraudulent close transaction before Sybil is able to (due to nlocktime). With an honest close this is not possible because Alice does not know Sybil's revocation secrets.
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:58:17
Not third party. Yes off-chain, which is why it's so good.
@_date: 2018-07-30 00:14:17
Nope, Lightning "ledgers" or channels can stay open indefinitely, but at any point can any party involved close it if the other goes unresponsive/uncooperative (or for any other reason).
You can use your channels to send money to or receive money from anyone else on the network as long as a chain of channels can be found between you and them, and opening/closing a channel costs fees, so you want to have a bunch of long-living channels to minimize fees.
In any case, that's not really relevant for your story, so I won't bore you with any further details (unless you're interested, of course). Cool to see bitcoin use in the wild by non-experts :)

Miners don't move the money, they prevent the money from being double-spent. But instead of having a centralized, trusted institute to ensure no money is being double-spent (like a bank), Bitcoin mining is designed to be decentralized and trustless; ie. the miners cannot steal your money (while a bank could).

Softforks are a fundamentally different story. I don't need to use segwit to be compatible with the segwit chain; in other words I do not lose the ability to use bitcoin if I choose to keep a node without segwit (that is otherwise compatible, ie. old core versions are fine, BCH clients are not).

@_date: 2017-10-09 15:11:15
Well, it's a change on the consensus layer that loosens the rules (unblacklists the blacklist-address used in their anti-replay), which is the very definition of a hardfork. Just because the forkdate is in the future doesn't mean it's not a hardfork. If anyone runs a B2X node with the replay transaction they will reject blocks that contain transactions with the old-style anti-replay.

Bitcoin is money. In many cases it is faster and cheaper than e.g. wire transfers. However, due to the fundamental scalability issues of the blockchain (direct tradeoff vs. its security), a "write-cache" layer like LN is needed.

You are arguing from the wrong perspective, in a hardfork the onus of convincing people of the superiority of the fork is on the hardforkers, as the default action (not changing your node) is to follow the original chain.

Sure, but miners have other attack vectors as well, especially with a 51% hashrate cabal. Double spends via reorgs, coin/tx censorship, etc etc.

I'm not exactly sure on the timestamp thing you mention, but something else in your question stood out to me;


The bitcoin network is "supposed" to be operational until much, much later (speaking purely on a technical level here, socially there is no "supposed"). Miners will continue to earn transaction fees after the block reward dries up.

If I understand it correctly, it's a special form of a replay attack in the case of a sustained chainsplit where the BIP148 chain activates segwit but the legacy chain doesn't. But in that scenario, BIP148-chain is almost certain to stomp the legacy chain in terms of usability, since it allows LN, and the economy and therefore the miners will shift to that chain, leading to the legacy chain being annihilated in a massive reorganization.

Alright, I hope that the majority gets on board with BIP148 because if it succeeds, it will go off without a hitch, but if it initially doesn't get hashpower behind it there's going to be a chainsplit.

@_date: 2017-05-27 20:42:44
But legacy nodes will happily switch to the BIP148 chain if it gets longer at any point in the future, and that would not be true if it was not a softfork.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:02:22


The only way this segwit2mb compromise would not cause a chainsplit would be A) to lock in Segwit before August 1 **and** B) for the hardfork not to happen.
Any other result will cause a significant part of the economy to fork off, in case of A) the BIP148 community and in case of B) everyone who hasn't switched to a HF-compatible client, which is likely to be most of the economy.


The game theory favors BIP148 in terms of reorganization risk, that's why I am on board. Exploring the game theory and economic incentives in case a split happens is an important part of why I think BIP148 is such a strong proposition; the risk is asymmetric and in favor of BIP148, so any chainsplit is biased against the "legacy"-chain.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:27:08

Slight correction there; BIP148 still allows non-segwit TXes and blocks, it just boycotts the "veto" of enabling segwit. Even with segwit enabled (thus *allowing* segwit TXes and blocks), segwit TXes and blocks are not *mandatory*.

There is no voting in bitcoin (yet?). Miners signal in the blocks they mine. Nodes signal to eachother about what kind of blocks they understand.
Bitcoin core after version 0.13.1 understands and supports Segwit TXes and blocks and signals this capability to its peers. For you to imply that running Segwit-aware and -capable software does not indicate readiness and willingness to upgrade is skewing the narrative unfairly.
Nobody who is in favor of BIP148 is claiming that all people running Segwit-capable nodes want or are even aware of UASF. Hell, that's why there is such widespread community activity going on to explain and educate on these topics, people should understand the risks that a chainsplit holds for them.

BIP148 is quite simple in its logic; it adds a new rule that all blocks, starting from August 1 and ending on November 15 (the deadline for the BIP9 activation of Segwit) **have to signal** until Segwit is locked in.
So what a miner needs to do to be BIP148-compliant, is to activate certain version bits in the header of any blocks it makes (in other words, needs to signal for Segwit), and at the same time make sure that it only builds on top of the BIP148-valid-chain (ie. make sure that all previous blocks starting from August 1 are also signalling). After Segwit locks in, BIP148 deactivates, so after that it's whatever is the longest chain.
Edit: btw, the absolutely simplest way for miners to be BIP148 compliant is to collectively activate Segwit before August 1 so that the BIP148 logic never comes into play.

It is true. A miner that doesn't signal for segwit will just blindly mine on top of the longest chain, even if it is a BIP148 chain that keeps orphaning his blocks.


I agree with that part, which is part of, but not the entire picture.


Indeed, because BIP148 is more selective than legacy. There is an asymmetry at play in the game theory.


No, that is the exact opposite of the truth. Legacy WILL get orphaned if it gets reorganized by the BIP148 chain.

An answer I gave earlier to someone else, hopefully this will catch you up enough:
Segwit is currently the best horse in the block scaling debate in short-term by far, while also fixing some bugs that are required for mid- to long-term scaling solutions. It's seriously well-engineered; even backwards compatible with older nodes which in the past, before this possibility was discovered, made it seem like a non-viable option because of the network's upgrade inertia.
Unfortunately, the designers of the deployment mechanism [naively gave veto power to the miners]( the ones that are making [insanely high profits off the fees right now]( Surprise surprise, they are unwilling to enable it. Then, news broke that one of the biggest players in the mining industry may be blocking the upgrade because it is incompatible with its [secret patented tech]( Tech, btw, that is directly in conflict with Bitcoin's security assumptions, exploiting a weakness in the Bitcoin mining algorithm so seriously that it now has [a CVE number](
UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) is a movement of users that are not cool with this kind of corporate takeover of Bitcoin. BIP148 is the specific UASF that is now gaining a lot of traction and is already represented by [over 10% of listening nodes in the network]( What it aims to do is to economically force the miners' hands into activating the existing deployment of Segwit by boycotting all non-signalling blocks. On Litecoin, the mere threat of this same UASF [led the miners to fold on their blockade]( On Vertcoin, the UASF actually overcame a blocking miner that kept up an extended fight, wasting tons of money on mining more incompatible blocks than there were compatible blocks.
With Bitcoin the stakes are much higher, and the disinformation campaigns much bigger. Keep a critical eye open to everything you read, and make up your own mind. Educate yourself, for your own good. [Being passive is not the safe, neutral option]( If you want to understand truly how insane the game theory is at this point, [read the plea for rational extremism]( It is accurate as far as I can tell.
If you are interested in chatting there's a [slack]( with a community support channel with a ton of pinned resources to help you spin up your own BIP148 node if you feel so inclined.

Incorrect. If **no** miners are mining blocks on this new chain then there isn't a new chain.
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:46:47
1. Old-style blocks are still allowed under Segwit, so it's not impossible. Only Segwit-style blocks aren't compatible with covert AB. Granted, it does make the whole covert AB less covert and is *de facto* incompatible but not *de jure*.
2. It is the **current deployment** of Segwit that makes covert AB less covert. Segwit-as-a-hardfork doesn't. Perhaps some alternative deployment using version bit 4 doesn't.

No they won't. Most nodes on the network are fine with BIP-148 chain and will happily reorganize into it if it becomes the longest chain.
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:29:31


Yes, and you won't have a strong community cherrypicking your chain (in the case of BIP148) or have the claim to the longest chain. Those are the two options that will be listed on any exchanges that don't just follow the longest chain. So where are you going to spend your mined coins? You have 0 network effect.


I challenged the implicit assumption that "not signalling" meant "against" segwit.


Because 148 can never be reorganized away by legacy according to those who enforce 148 rules. It's like... Normal food and kosher food. If you don't care about kosher food you're just gonna go to the restaurant in town with the best food (the longest chain). If you eat kosher you're going to the best restaurant in town *that serves kosher food*. If the kosher restaurant overtakes the non-kosher restaurant in terms of food quality (chain length), everybody switches to the kosher restaurant. If the non-kosher restaurant then takes over again, there will be a split again.


Depends on the AD setting. Any miner with AD=999999999 will refuse to delete a non-longest chain that violates its EB, no?

The good news; coins in your trezor are safe during a chainsplit. You wont lose them if you dont touch them.
If youre looking to be economically active during a chainsplit, you will need to do whats called cointainting with TXes that only exist on one side of the split, the easiest way is mixing your coins with other tainted coins.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:35:19
Users can protect themselves against such replay attacks by tainting their coins (making them only usable on one chain by making TXes that are invalid on the other chain, such as by mixing them with post-chainsplit mining rewards that will never exist on the other chain).
Otherwise your analysis seems about right. We need exchanges on board to allow trading between the two chains, then the free market can run its course and we will see who the natural winner is.

I plan on selling legacy-coins but not my 148-coins in case of a split. That way, if 148 becomes the longer chain I will have all my bitcoin and some free fiat.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:20:53


Well, if you want to buy BTC with fiat, at most places you need to provide ID because it's the law ie. governments demand this happens. If you then spend those coins somewhere, people (including governments) can track that using statistical analysis techniques. Jeff Garzik has a company [that specializes in this](
There are ways to counteract this kind of spying behaviour, using things like [joinmarket]( but it's slow and expensive, and opt-in. Ideally Bitcoin privacy goes to the level of "mandatory" so that people cannot be punished for making use of such services, which is a hypothetical possibility right now. Segwit builds towards more fungible technologies, one of which is LN.


The counter proposals on the scaling debate are all just focused on the scaling aspect of things, but Segwit is killing multiple birds with one stone, and it is deployable as a soft-fork, to boot. It doesn't magically solve everything in one go, but it's an insanely good deal for every user and you would be crazy to pass it up.

You apparently don't know how a [sybil attack]( works. A sybil attacker doesn't actually need to spawn a multitude of *real* nodes, it just needs to spawn a multitude of *apparent* nodes.
The cheaper it is to run a real node, the more resistant the network is against such attacks.
@_date: 2017-05-01 06:44:38
Yes it is, and Segwit promises to make exactly this kind of UTXO-reducing dust-sweeping TX more affordable since the largest and therefore most expensive part of that TX is probably the witness data.

I think what you say is valid, I agree for the most part (with a bit more hesitancy about whether or not a split will occur, though things are looking hopeful). Our points are compatible with eachother, as mine was only about the case in which there is a chainsplit.

Its relatively easy to do, there may even be a decentralized joinmarket-style solution for it by August, because mixing your coins with a split coin splits them.

Sounds about right. Any Segwit deployment activation that can be done **now** has to either be compatible with the current deployment or *so complex that the big guns wouldn't even do it for BIP149*.
Since there is no code on the table for the latter, we cannot take it seriously, so it must be the former or bullshit. BIP148 is fully compatible with the current deployment, so spin up your own node now to make sure the miners keep their word.

They can do that, but in case that BIP148 gets a majority hashrate, they would cherrypick a shorter chain to mine on, without the benefit of a market that favors that chain. BIP148 has a market even if it's the shorter chain.


No, because they can't change the rules for legacy wallets/reset any sort of reorg points on behalf of other people's software. That's why it's important to run your own node, so that others cannot choose the rules for you.

@_date: 2017-05-21 09:58:25
Well there's a couple different terms, I hope you'll bear with me.
A softfork is a protocol rules change that is backwards compatible, in the sense that users don't **need** to upgrade their software to keep following the correct blockchain. This is in contrast to a hardfork, where unupgraded nodes are stuck on a legacy chain. Softforks are generally considered more safe because of this reason.
A User Activated Soft Fork. In contrast to a MASF (Miner Activated). A UASF works by users choosing to run new software and start enforcing new (backwards compatible) rules regardless of what miners do. Miners are incentivized to follow along or have their blocks considered invalid by the economy.
Is the specific UASF that is now gaining momentum. BIP148 is quite simple in its logic; it adds a new rule that all blocks, starting from August 1 and ending on November 15 (the deadline for the MASF activation of Segwit) **have to signal** until Segwit is locked in. The idea behind this is to break the current political deadlock.

@_date: 2017-05-14 21:32:42
No, a CPU is suitable for general tasks, an ASIC is application specific (it's in the name). Not just "more efficient", "only suitable" for that specific task. That's why PoWchange hurts ASIC miners when it wouldn't hurt CPU or GPU miners, or to an extent even FPGA miners.
My point is you can't claim "1 hash = 1 vote" being "Nakamoto consensus" when you change the definition from the one that Nakamoto gave, which is "1 CPU = 1 vote".
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:18:32
It's not an either or, we can do both.
Also, the mechanisms of a chainsplit are actually in favor of BIP148; if BIP148 gets a majority hashrate, there won't **be** a legacy chain. In case BIP148 gets a minority hashrate, there will be a chainsplit, but if at any point mining power shifts to the BIP148 chain the legacy chain is in danger of being reorganized into oblivion.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:39:38
Fair points, I think a lot of them are being worked on. I've spoken to some devs with ideas on how to let people split their coins efficiently but it's still very much a work in progress. Maybe there will be some ELI5 coinsplitting article at some point to prepare people for the possible turbulence.
Already we see exchanges and brokers come into the slack to discuss the UASF software. Some compile their own anyway so aren't too worried about waiting for it to be merged into core if they can review the diff, while some understandably have other IT management approaches.
I really hope that the latest discussions on the devlist are a good indication that the differences between mining pool operators and open-source software engineers can be resolved, and that the community can prevent a chainsplit, but we will see in August how things fall. The BIP148 side will be prepared :)

An answer I gave earlier to someone else, hopefully this will catch you up enough to do your own further research, unfortunately I don't have time to discuss this in depth right now:
Segwit is currently the best horse in the block scaling debate in short-term by far, while also fixing some bugs that are required for mid- to long-term scaling solutions. It's seriously well-engineered; even backwards compatible with older nodes which in the past, before this possibility was discovered, made it seem like a non-viable option because of the network's upgrade inertia.
Unfortunately, the designers of the deployment mechanism [naively gave veto power to the miners]( the ones that are making [insanely high profits off the fees right now]( Surprise surprise, they are unwilling to enable it. Then, news broke that one of the biggest players in the mining industry may be blocking the upgrade because it is incompatible with its [secret patented tech]( Tech, btw, that is directly in conflict with Bitcoin's security assumptions, exploiting a weakness in the Bitcoin mining algorithm so seriously that it now has [a CVE number](
UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) is a movement of users that are not cool with this kind of corporate takeover of Bitcoin. BIP148 is the specific UASF that is now gaining a lot of traction and is already represented by [over 10% of listening nodes in the network]( What it aims to do is to economically force the miners' hands into activating the existing deployment of Segwit by boycotting all non-signalling blocks. On Litecoin, the mere threat of this same UASF [led the miners to fold on their blockade]( On Vertcoin, the UASF actually overcame a blocking miner that kept up an extended fight, wasting tons of money on mining more incompatible blocks than there were compatible blocks.
With Bitcoin the stakes are much higher, and the disinformation campaigns much bigger. Keep a critical eye open to everything you read, and make up your own mind. Educate yourself, for your own good. [Being passive is not the safe, neutral option]( If you want to understand truly how insane the game theory is at this point, [read the plea for rational extremism]( It is accurate as far as I can tell.

The most credible criticism of SW I've been able to find (and man have I been looking), is that it **doesn't magically solve everything**. Every change it does improves the situation, but since it's not 100% perfect, even though it's the best option available, supposedly it's not good enough.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:21:33


On the contrary, I'd argue that BIP148-coin has a very strong value proposition; stronger than Bitcoin. It is one where protocol governance is not unilaterally decided by miners, nor by naysayers such as you, but rather decided by the community as a whole.

The UASF is a boycott of non-cooperative miners' blocks. Miners who are blocking an upgrade to Bitcoin. Almost the entire ecosystem wants this upgrade, except for the miners who are ("totally not related we swear") profiting off insanely high fees that would go down if this upgrade was put in place.
How this affects you: it doesn't, until August 1st. On August 1st, if the miners keep being non-compliant they will cause a chainsplit. Before that, there is no worry for your trades. After that, there is no worry for hodling. If you want to trade during the chainsplit, however, you'll need to read up on "coin tainting".

I think it stems from (one of?) the first LN presentation by Dryja and Poon where they described the LN topology as "hub and spoke" which has led to this "big centralized hubs" idea. Talking to the people who are working on the project I have heard that it will probably be more mesh-like, due to how mesh nodes are using their capital far more efficiently.
The way I understand their argument is that in a hub-and-spoke model, as a hub, the network behind any of your channels is (relatively) very small - only one endpoint for the lowest level hub. This means that the capital tied up in that channel is only being used to "sell" LN service to one end-user's (daily) needs. On the other hand, if the topology was more mesh-like, the network behind that customer would be far bigger and the throughput of transactions, and thereby the utilization of the funds in the channel, would be far larger.

Unfortunately, as has been explained [here]( in uncompromising terms, if there's a chainsplit in August, inaction is not the neutral stance and could put your or your users' funds at risk.
For a risk-averse business operator like yourself it's going to be vital to make sure the coins you handle are not subject to replay attacks at the very least, and allowing token trading between the two chains will likely be a much-desired feature.

The good news: if you simply hold pre-split coins and don't trade after August 1 until the storm settles down *everything is fine*, clear skies and all that.
The bad news: the non-BIP148-chain (I'll call it legacy-chain from now on) is less trustworthy, because its history (from after the split) can be wiped if the 148-chain ever gets longer. This kind of history-wiping is called a reorganization, and happens daily in Bitcoin even now, but usually it's not so much of a problem since the history being wiped is very short and usually transactions can be confirmed again in a later block.
However, in case the chainsplit lasts a few days before it is resolved, you might be in more trouble; it's very possible that a legacy-coin you receive on August 4 already has a history that makes it incompatible with the 148-chain; this TX will *never* reconfirm if 148 reorganizes the legacy chain.
Yes, this situation is fucked. So fucked, that [balls to the walls extremism is the only sane choice](

It's a game of incentives in the free market. If people value a 148-coin higher than a legacy-coin, it is in miners' economic interest to mine on the 148 side of the split.
Due to
1. the asymmetric reorganization risk putting the legacy coins at risk of being wiped out of existence, and
2. the higher probability of getting segwit on 148-chain
it's not unlikely that users value 148-coins higher. P.s. point 1 also incentivizes miners to mine 148-coin.

BIP148 is the UASF most people know; basically a user-forced signalling for the existing deployment of BIP9 95%-hashpower activation of Segwit.
BIP149 is a new UASF which is a new Segwit deployment using BIP8 instead of BIP9. The difference between BIP9 and BIP8 is so simple it's deceptive; BIP9 ends in a timeout/deactivation, BIP8 ends in a flagday/activation.

Don't worry, the OMG CENSORSHIP!!!11!ONE crowd is just butthurt trolls that aren't allowed to shit on the discourse. [This is a good read on the general principle]( I've been active on both subs for a while and this one generally gives me much less of a headache and much more good information, which is why I tend to be more active here nowadays. So let me answer some of those concerns.


Segwit is a max blocksize increase to 4MB. Not all 4MB will be immediately usable, because only a new format for transaction seralization (commonly referred to as segwit transactions) can make use of the additional 3MB space. This is a necessary evil to keep the upgrade backwards-compatible.


Unfortunately, Satoshi added a 1MB hardcap to the blocksize, which requires a hardfork to remove. Segwit incorporates a way around the hardcap by moving the validation info (the signatures of a transaction, referred to as the WITness data) to a new data structure that isn't showed to legacy nodes. This means that, with already ~85% of the network segwit-capable, the remaining 15% will simply not be able to validate all transactions, but still the ones that pay out to their addresses, and still be able to observe all transactions, essentially dropping them to better-than-SPV-wallet status. Hardforking, on the other hand, requires 100% of the network to update their software. You can imagine, what with e.g. hospitals still running XP on their computers, that this isn't an easy feat to pull off.


Segwit is surprisingly elegant and simple, this is just [FUD]( aimed at non-technical people. Besides, we're talking about a cryptocurrency here, [this tweet is on point](


Segwit itself doesn't do that, but the bugfix it provides (fixing the transaction malleability bug, if you feel like googling) allows for off-chain scaling solutions such as Lightning Network ([here]( a great video by Andreas Antonopoulos on that). Sure, it was a later development that Satoshi did not predict when he wrote his whitepaper, but rbtc has a nasty tendency of treating the whitepaper like religious text and treating any and all things that were not in it as high treason against the church of satoshi or something like that.
Hope I didn't bore you with that wall of text :P

I understand your reaction, but understand the rationale behind it before you judge. This is emotional rhetoric to talk yourself out of doing nothing and hoping to "ride the wave" to safety out of fear of doing something bad, but in this case inaction is more likely to lead to problems. As OP said:


It is the "sane" choice because extremism is, bizarrely enough, the risk-averse choice in this fucked up situation.


I think "force" in the context of how OP used it means "make it more risky for you not to by doing it myself, because I believe that is the least risky strategy overall AND for every individual including myself".


As OP responded to you, it only works because the protocol change it activates is in popular demand.

EC is very poorly engineered. This is why I am against it. Not because it increases the block size (I'm in favor of increasing the block size), but because it does so in an utterly retarded way. Hell, I'd even be in favor of the Silbert agreement if 
1. it had a realistic timeframe, 6 months is too short for a HF deployment phase, let alone for a plan where there is no code on the table, no code review, etc. etc. etc. and
2. it included more HF-only upgrades; HFs are a bitch to coordinate and the failure mode of not-upgrading is being kicked off the majority chain. In that sense softforks, even contentious ones like 148, are less harmful because the only ones that risk being on a minority chain are the ones that choose so.
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:23:28
You are misinformed or maliciously spreading misinformation. BIP148 only forces the Segwit activation, it does not force Segwit blocks or TXes. The p2p logic of segwit was engineered around dealing with unupgraded nodes so the problems you describe are nonexistent.

I think that's the implication, yes. The logic goes:

* then miners will be economically incentivized to mine there
* which will lead the hashrate to go up above the legacy chain's hashrate
* which will lead the BIP148 chain to overtake the legacy chain
* which will lead the legacy chain to disappear in a massive reorganization

Wow you're really hitting all the FAQ points effectively there. :D


Storage is a 2-part problem. First there's the archive of the blockchain that needs to be kept available for new nodes syncing up from the genesis block, but in order to be a fully-validating node you don't need to be a fully-archiving node. I've ran such a pruned node from a 16GB TAILS usb stick, with OS and all. I literally had a fully-validating node in my pocket, that I could stick into any computer or laptop, boot from it and transact with with full privacy, all internet connections routed through Tor. The blockchain history took only a tiny fraction of the USB stick.
A much more significant worry is the UTXO set. With current technology, all unspent Bitcoins are kept track of and stored, separately from the blockchain. This may be improved in some future upgrade, but for now this is quite a problematic dataset, as it is growing and growing. In the current cost calculation, TXes that combine unspent coins into bigger ones (effectively reducing the memory footprint of the UTXO set) are *more expensive* than TXes that split coins into smaller ones (bloating the UTXO set). Segwit shifts the storage-cost calculation function so that this effective "penalty on efficient transactions" is reduced (although not removed entirely).
Furthermore, this UTXO set is best kept in RAM for performance reasons (every incoming TX has to be compared against the unspent coins to check it is valid), which is several price categories higher per unit of memory than e.g. HDD space which is where the blockchain is kept in archival nodes.

Segwit signalling = signalling for segwit activation. It has no meaning after segwit activates.
After activation, as long as unupgraded miners follow regular policy and dont mine nonstandard txes they only risk mining on top of an invalid block, not mining one themselves. Of course this is always true for validationless mining.

My point was that in case of a permanent chainsplit that turns bip148 into an altcoin - the context in which was reasoning - 100% of bip148 users have actively chosen to be on that chain. Things could not get more "user activated" than that.

Only in case of a minority hashrate behind 148 and it would be a chainsplit, not a hard fork, but alright.


No, if 148 overtakes "legacy" it will reorganize it in the eyes of the vast majority among legacy nodes. From that point on legacy nodes and 148 nodes will be in agreement on "the one chain" again.


It's more of a question of what legacy nodes see happen. They will follow the longest chain between the two, so as soon as 148 becomes longer all post-split history on the legacy chain will be "undone" in a big reorganization. (A reorganization is the process of the Bitcoin network switching to a different, longer chain even though it had accepted blocks belonging to the now-shorter chain in the past).

A lot of people (including myself) are recommending people to withdraw Bitcoins from exchanges that don't offer any sort of protection against a chainsplit.
Imho the ideal way for this situation to get resolved is by exchanges offering trading between two tokens so the free market will decide which side is more valuable - miners would be unwise not to mine where the money is.
Also, segwit enables LN which has all kinds of cool tech that would allow for much more decentralized services, but, unfortunately that exact tech is being blocked (which is what the UASF is about in the first place, boycotting the blockade).
Edit: also, [Bitfinex has expressed positive attitude to listing bip148](
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:16:34

So the question becomes, do you want
1. Segwit designed, built and tested by experts in cryptography and a pro-privacy attitude, or do you want
2. Segwit co-opted in a political powergrab by anti-privacy interests.
If the latter is fine, by all means switch to BTC1 clients. If not, keep calm and BIP148 on.

Consider yourself corrected. The plea is for exchanges to recognize the BIP148-side of a chainsplit, and to offer services such as replay protection (it's a lot easier for big exchanges to do coinsplitting than it is to arrange this in a decentralized manner, although joinmarket-esque techniques may help here) and token trading between the chains.


No, the selling point is that the economy would value BIP148-coins higher (due to it enabling segwit as well as the asymmetric reorganization risk), and miners would mine on the more profitable side of the split.


This is the mechanical threat of BIP148, and I have jumped on board supporting it because a successful BIP148 means that no chainsplit happens. Bizarrely, being risk-averse has led me here. I hope to minimize the economic disruption on Bitcoin of BIP148; it is naive to think that BIP148 will be abandoned by its hardcore supporters, so the safest path is to fight for its overwhelming success. BTW, this only makes sense in the current case of a clearly beneficial upgrade (Segwit) that is being blocked because of politics and perverse incentives.

It was a misunderstanding on the miners' end that the development process of Bitcoin is so centralized that they could politically pressure just a few "representatives" into pushing through changes in spite of the community.

Core won't merge BIP148 until there is sufficient evidence of community uptake, so you won't get it through the official channels (quite yet).

In the general case, false; Satoshi used UASFs as his upgrade method of choice.
In the case of BIP148, false; it was designed with the risk of a chainsplit in mind, but it was not designed to make one happen - one would only happen if hashrate did not comply with it.
S2X and ABC most definitely create a chainsplit no matter how the hashrate is distributed.

@_date: 2017-05-03 13:09:36
has expressed that he prefers BIP149 (before it had a BIP number) because it is cleaner. Downside of it is that it's a whole new deployment so we ~~won't~~ might not get Segwit until mid 2018.
Segwit is backwards compatible with legacy blocks, so it doesn't force miners to mine Segwit blocks, it only encourages them to validate that Segwit blocks mined by others are valid (because otherwise they would be SPV mining).
Edit: to clarify; BIP149 is not yet implemented into Core, but might be, as BIP8 is likely to be the full successor to BIP9 now that the mechanism of miner veto has turned out to enable perversion of incentives. BIP148 was never intended to be implemented in Core, so it's entirely a community thing.

Extension blocks still need further research and development to work properly. As I understand it there is still a major usability issue in terms of the resolution TX that is used to move funds back from the extension blocks to the main chain. Because this resolution TX can't be recreated with the same TXID if a block gets reorged, it means that any child TXes will never become valid again if that happens.
The current solution that is backwards compatible is by doing the resolution TX in the coinbase, creating a 100-block delay before resolution-TX funds can be spent. Kinda sucks for usability.
Problem is also that this increasingly appears to be part of a larger hostile takeover of Bitcoin development funded by Bitmain; there's strong reason to believe purse is funded through a fund created by Roger Ver and Jihan Wu, and now Bitpay (the former employer of one of the extension block devs and a vocal proponent of extblocks) has made a deal with Bitmain.

This exact logic applies to BIP148, only the new rules in 148 and the new rules in 66 are different.


Miners don't HAVE to run 148 as long as A) most of the miners do and B) they signal for 141.


Agreed. The length of the split is questionable though.


Not true in the case of majority hashrate adoption of BIP148 (or some compatible softfork such as BIP91 with miner activation before Aug 1).


Foregoing variance, yes.


Non-148 miners will orphan the shorter chain, 148 miners will orphan the non-148 chain regardless of chain length.
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:22:04
Nah mate, you're confusing the mechanical properties of a softfork and a hardfork and trying to turn the narrative around. Only hardforks like BU/EC can "fork away". Legacy chain can reorg into bip148-chain so it's a terrible bet for anyone to believe that legacy-chain funds will hang around.

BIP148 is a boycott of non-signalling blocks between August 1 and November 15.
See it like this: you are running a restaurant. I am a regular customer and come up to you and say "starting 1 January 2018 I'm gonna be a vegetarian, if you don't offer a vegetarian option then I will stop being your customer and go to your competitor instead". If you say "oh don't worry I was already planning to" and start offering a vegetarian option on the menu next week, it's way ahead of my deadline, but I'll still consider it a win for me, because I don't care about the boycott, I care about the vegetarian food.

Because Segwit increases the blocksize and fees are directly related to blocksize; **everything** becomes cheaper with Segwit. It is only *relatively speaking* that anything becomes more expensive, and even then it alleviates UTXO bloat.
The qualifier "unfair" is still undefined by and in my opinion it's probably more unfair that currently a TX with 1in, 2out (causing UTXO bloat) is a lot cheaper than a TX with 2in, 1out (consolidating and thereby alleviating UTXO bloat).

Nodecount is trivial to [Sybil attack]( BIP148 runs on economic power, not nodecount.
If you are trading with Bitcoin, then running a fullnode lets you choose your own fate by enforcing a certain ruleset. If you use 1 node for your trading (eg. by having your lightweight wallet software connect to your trusted fullnode) then it's meaningful to switch to a BIP148 node, but spinning up 10 more instances isn't going to do anything (unless you are some pro trader and actually need 10 instances).

@_date: 2017-05-20 11:30:20
Correct. With the current 3.5 months (Aug, Sep, Oct, half of Nov), BIP148-chain won't activate segwit if it has less than 15% of the global hashrate. Previously with the October start date, this was a significantly higher threshold, so this way is more "robust".
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:48:17
The concern with a hardfork is that **if successful** it will lead to a permanent chainsplit with the "default" option (that people who aren't actively paying attention will take) is to be on the wrong side.
With a UASF this is the other way around; only **if it fails** will it lead to a chainsplit, and the "default" option (that people who aren't actively paying attention will take) is to be on the right side.
Both carry a reorganization risk, though. But at this point BIP148 has already gained too much momentum for it not to at least cause some serious turbulence if it fails; the least disruptive thing is to make it succeed.

Well there's a technical reason for why you would or wouldn't call something a soft fork, and it has to do with legacy nodes. A soft fork is a protocol change where new-style blocks are accepted by legacy nodes, while a hard fork is a protocol change where new-style blocks are rejected by legacy nodes. Any blocks in the BIP148 chain are perfectly fine according to all nodes that currently follow the longest chain.

EDIT: since this is at the moment the top comment I will put this disclaimer; this answer **only** concerns hodlers/non-savvy folk who don't touch their coins regularly. For active traders, you're better informed by the link at the bottom of my post.
TL:DR; if you don't touch your coins, they will stay intact (assuming you are in full control of them ie. don't store them on an exchange or something), but there may be some price turbulence. If you ride out the turbulence you will be 100% fine though, because eventually the storm will settle and any price drop will recover, whichever "side" wins.

@_date: 2017-05-03 12:25:24
If the majority of nodes (exchanges etc) have updated to latest version of Core, and are enforcing BIP149, there is a *lot* of economic incentive for miners to be in that "10%" because that 10% is the only part of the miners that gets any "genuine" coins.
So the miners would be burning hashrate if they didn't upgrade. Which should be enough reason for them to upgrade.

Yes. Literally the only difference between bip9 and bip8 is that bip9 ends in a timeout deactivation and bip8 ends in a flagday activation.
Its deceptively simple in logic, but because the change is in such a crucial junction it makes a fundamental difference and removes the effective miner veto (that was a design flaw of bip9) from the equation.

If miners choose to mine (on top of) invalid blocks it most definitely **IS** in the non-mining user's interest to protect themselves from being defrauded by accepting such invalid blocks.
Given a choice from scratch, would I choose the limit of 1mb blocks? Hell no. But the transition to go beyond that from the status quo is not a trivial one, and you can't just yolo a consensus change in a system carrying a multi-billion collective investment like you are implying.

Segwit is currently the best horse in the block scaling debate in short-term by far, while also fixing some bugs that are required for mid- to long-term scaling solutions. It's seriously well-engineered; even backwards compatible with older nodes which in the past made it seem like a non-viable option because of the network's upgrade inertia.
Unfortunately, the designers of the deployment mechanism [naively gave veto power to the miners]( the ones that are making [insanely high profits off the fees right now]( Surprise surprise, they are unwilling to enable it. Then, news broke that one of the biggest players in the mining industry may be blocking the upgrade because it is incompatible with its [secret patented tech]( Tech, btw, that is directly in conflict with Bitcoin's security assumptions, exploiting a weakness in the Bitcoin mining algorithm so seriously that it now has [a CVE number](
UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) is a movement of users that are not cool with this kind of corporate takeover of Bitcoin. BIP148 is the specific UASF that is now gaining a lot of traction and is already represented by [over 10% of listening nodes in the network]( What it aims to do is to economically force the miners' hands into activating the existing deployment of Segwit by boycotting all non-signalling blocks. On Litecoin, the mere threat of this same UASF [led the miners to fold on their blockade]( On Vertcoin, the UASF actually overcame a blocking miner that kept up an extended fight, wasting tons of money on mining more incompatible blocks than there were compatible blocks.
With Bitcoin the stakes are much higher, and the disinformation campaigns much bigger. Keep a critical eye open to everything you read, and make up your own mind. Educate yourself, for your own good. [Being passive is not the safe, neutral option]( If you want to understand truly how insane the game theory is at this point, [read the plea for rational extremism]( It is accurate as far as I can tell.
If you are interested in chatting there's a [mumble]( and a [slack]( the latter of which has a community support channel with a ton of pinned resources to help you spin up your own BIP148 node if you feel so inclined.

Well the point is that if he spent on one side of a chainsplit like that without doing any cointainting he'd be vulnerable to replay attacks.

It carries a bit more meaning than that, since I and others like me who are running such a node have decided for ourselves to want to be on the BIP148 side of a chainsplit if it happens. I hope it doesn't happen, but if it does, BIP148 is what I choose to honor.
Of course you are right that me running a node doesn't mean much if no exchanges support it, but it's a bit more useful than a facebook like or a petition signature.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:29:09
That seems to be the plan, the nigh-official predecessor of BIP9 is BIP8, a UASF with optional early-activation MASF. BIP148 is an emergency measure and its activation logic will most likely not be used again.

Not really, it's made **potentially** compatible, as in *not definitely* **in**compatible. There's no guarantee they will be BIP148-compatible or even activate segwit at all if they change their mind or are slow to update.

@_date: 2017-06-14 11:07:00
The timings of BIP91 + the scheduled signalling start of Segwit2x (21 July) pretty much guarantees a BIP148 chainsplit. It takes a 2 week signalling period with 80% + a 2 week lock-in period before orphaning starts with BIP91, but there's only 10 days between the official signalling start and August 1.

It is.


They are.


They would.


Since Segwit enforcement is present in ~85% of the Bitcoin network, the minority fork should be short-lived unless miners really want to burn their income.


False, a fork can happen any time miners decide to do so by breaking the rules, there doesn't even need to be an active change in consensus for that to happen.


The rules themselves never cause a network fork, miners breaking the rules causes a fork.

Segwit2x is now, through the merging of BIP91, entirely backwards compatible with the existing BIP141 deployment, and could, by merging [a currently open PR]( prevent a 148-chainsplit entirely.
This new PR has re-ignited my hope for a "good end" to all of this. I will not spin down my BIP148 node because Segwit2x still needs to actually produce 80% signalling to do anything, so 148 might end up the more valuable chain after all, but if they manage to prevent a chainsplit it will certainly make me more amicable towards the 2x hardfork part.
Edit: of course the hardfork will still need to pass the "quality bar".

False, UASFs in general are backwards compatible, and specifically BIP148 is, otherwise the asymmetric reorganization risk would not threaten the legacy chain.

Wow, that's a deep rabbithole you've gone down. While I'm not an expert on sidechains, I know there are different designs continuously being worked on with different properties, and not all suffer from the problems you describe (probably the one that solves all these problems might eventually be used on Bitcoin).
However, all of that is irrelevant, because Segwit doesn't have anything to do with sidechains in the first place. Segwit is a change to the way the main blockchain works, which fixes some bugs (google: malleability bug, quadratic sighash) and allows for bigger blocks.

 is just signalling intent.
For everyone who is concerned about the chainsplit but not knowledgeable enough: this will not split the chain. Only if Segwit is not locked in on August 1 might there be a chainsplit.
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:52:27
An answer I gave earlier to someone else, hopefully this will catch you up enough (it's a few days old so horribly outdated but eh cba to rewrite it right now):
Segwit is currently the best horse in the block scaling debate in short-term by far, while also fixing some bugs that are required for mid- to long-term scaling solutions. It's seriously well-engineered; even backwards compatible with older nodes which in the past, before this possibility was discovered, made it seem like a non-viable option because of the network's upgrade inertia. This backwards compatibility alone (aside from the other benefits it offers) makes it superior to other, more naive solutions such as "just increase the blocksize to 2mb" as this would require the entire network to update their software to succeed.
Unfortunately, the designers of the deployment mechanism [naively gave veto power to the miners]( the ones that are making [insanely high profits off the fees right now]( Surprise surprise, they are unwilling to enable it. Then, news broke that one of the biggest players in the mining industry may be blocking the upgrade because it is incompatible with its [secret patented tech]( Tech, btw, that is directly in conflict with Bitcoin's security assumptions, exploiting a weakness in the Bitcoin mining algorithm so seriously that it now has [a CVE number](
UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) is a movement of users that are not cool with this kind of corporate takeover of Bitcoin. BIP148 is the specific UASF that is now gaining a lot of traction and is already represented by [over 10% of listening nodes in the network]( What it aims to do is to economically force the miners' hands into activating the existing deployment of Segwit by boycotting all non-signalling blocks. On Litecoin, the mere threat of this same UASF [led the miners to fold on their blockade]( On Vertcoin, the UASF actually overcame a blocking miner that kept up an extended fight, wasting tons of money on mining more incompatible blocks than there were compatible blocks.
With Bitcoin the stakes are much higher, and the disinformation campaigns much bigger. Keep a critical eye open to everything you read, and make up your own mind. Educate yourself, for your own good. [Being passive is not the safe, neutral option]( If you want to understand truly how insane the game theory is at this point, [read the plea for rational extremism]( It is accurate as far as I can tell.
If you are interested in chatting there's a [slack]( with a community support channel with a ton of pinned resources to help you spin up your own BIP148 node if you feel so inclined.

There's a snowball effect. You don't want to be the last miner to jump ship.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:15:58
Well consider also that every node is incentivized to keep its channels "balanced" ie. close to the midpoint is better as a completely maxed out channel in either direction has very limited use, settling or topping up is a costly onchain TX. I personally think people will want to have multiple channels open (~5?) so their LN node can go "oh yeah sure i can pass along a payment from channel A to B, C, D or E; B and C are actually beneficial for me since they get more balanced so I'll do those for free, D and E are possible but it'll cost ya a satoshi."
@_date: 2017-06-09 09:18:48
Only if you actually *have* them ie. have sole control of the privkeys. If your bitcoins are on an exchange/webwallet that doesnt give you sole control of the privkeys you don't *have* bitcoin, you *are owed* bitcoin, and you are dependent on a third party to not lose them.

Hell, I consider myself a big blocker, in that I *hope* Bitcoin scales into the far future where all the off-chain scaling in the world can't hold it back from needing bigger blocks.
But yes, "dumb" blocksize increases are a shoddy solution, we need some sort of dynamic algorithm that responds to the actual demand, in a way that cannot be gamed by miners.
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:06:38
As an outspoken BIP148 supporter; you are not making a lot of sense.


Miners could not choose to mine SegWit transactions, that's the problem; an upgrade being blocked. Even after activation of SegWit miners are not forced to mine SegWit transactions or blocks either. The only thing BIP148 enforces is **signalling** for SegWit activation, so that the ~85% of the network that is ready to go will enforce the segwit rules.


Do you mean "with"?
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:21:50
Go ahead, I'll wait.
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:22:25
Because private-mining their own hardfork doesn't seem to make much sense to me; why would any other miner jump on board with that? But if they plan on having some of their hashrate "go dark" on a privately-mined reorg attack they need some sort of cover story, and I think this is it.
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:55:01
Well it's hypothetically possible they implemented the BIP91 changes without the hardfork part, so then the bit4 signalling would be signalling readiness genuinely.
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:09:12
Okay this is bullshit, miners are not slaves, they are not doing this job out of coercion, they are doing it for profit. As much as I agree that miners aren't in charge of the protocol, to say they are "slaves" is plainly untrue as well. They're paid workers.
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:53:26
Well if BIP148 starts off strong, Bitmain will have to dedicate significant hashrate to attack it, which disappears from the legacy side; other miners will see this and BIP148 might appear even stronger (relatively speaking), shifting hashpower there, starting the whole snowball effect. If this ends up with significant hashrate then Bitmain might still execute their secret-mining attack if they managed to get a head start but by that point the snowball will be well on its way with more and more miners jumping ship to 148, so I don't think that's a very unlikely scenario at all.

Please take care after August 1, there may be some turbulence as it is yet unknown if miners will avoid creating a chainsplit or not. You might want to refrain from transacting until the dust settles, because any transactions during a chainsplit are at risk of being wiped out if the BIP148-chain ends up winning. Transacting on the BIP148-chain should be safer, although it's opt-in so not everyone will be on it. Not sure what kind of security Copay offers but if you are the only one who has the private keys you should be safe just keeping your funds unmoving.

Just exploring the possible scenarios. I think that a contentious hardfork in bitcoin will be very bad for its value as well, but that's what Jihan seems to want so maybe he's not that interested in BTC's value at all. Can't really say what's going through his head.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:44:43
If you installed Bitcoin Core and did not take action to signal support for anything, you are not taking any side except that of "wanting to use Bitcoin in a trustless way", so you should be fine as it is. 
Be warned that after August 1 you should take care when spending money, as there might be a chainsplit that has some risks regarding so called "replay attacks" and "reorganizations". [Here's a good starting place to read up on that](

Signalling is relatively easy, you can do that with the official release of bitcoin core by setting a configuration option. If you want to be on the BIP148 side of a potential chainsplit you will need to run a BIP148-enforcing node. Currently that's not possible with the official releases, but discussion about introducing an option for that is ongoing.

My criticism of the 2mb hardfork part of the "compromise" isn't that 2mb is too big, it's the fact that it's a boring one-time blocksize bump with no additional HF-only improvements that still costs a HF to do... HFs are exceedingly costly to pull off due to the massive amount of coordination involved, so any HF should be more meaningful than that.
I personally would prefer a dynamic blocksize limit of some kind rather than a hardcap we're going to run into again sooner or later (with something as tiny as 2MB most likely being sooner). I think BIP105 has an interesting concept that allows miners to vote for bigger or smaller blocks with their hashrate.

The title is incorrect; "should" ought to be replaced with "could". With the recent merging of BIP91, Segwit2x now **is no longer definitely INcompatible** with 148. It's not necessarily 148-compliant. TL;DR on why you should still run a BIP148 node:
* If Segwit2x is 148-compliant and you are running a 148-fullnode: nothing goes wrong on August 1.
* If Segwit2x is NOT 148-compliant (too slow to reach 80% signal rate) and you are NOT running a 148-fullnode: you might be on the end of a chainsplit that eventually gets reorganized into oblivion.

The number of full nodes is a fakeable metric, and therefore is a flawed measure of support for any particular implementation, that's what the "the number of full nodes is not important" is about. One of the fundamentals of Bitcoin is that people don't need to trust third parties to use it, because all transactions can be fully verified to be valid, but the only way to achieve that is to run a full node.
Fair warning; it'll take you a pretty big chunk of bandwidth to download the entire history (currently around 120 GB), although if you run your full node in what's called "pruned" mode you only need to store less than 1 GB of it (although running an "archive" node is helpful to the network if you have hard disk space you are not using; you can always enable pruning later).

o.o Whoa calm down there buddy. I was countering the point that not being able to specifically transact on the 148-chain will make it so there is no economical impact; dumping legacy seems like a good way to make 148 worth mining to miners that are hawk-eyeing the price charts to maximize their profits.
And yes, I've spoken to belcher about this, although the dynamics of joinmarket will work the other way around; one maker can serve many takers in a single TX, so the coding changes might not be trivial.
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:21:01
I agree, a dynamic blocksize that adjusts to the market, tending towards the optimum price point would be wonderful; I don't think that bumping it with a 2X multiplier is particularly interesting or worth a hardfork when we already have a softfork ready to roll for a 2-4X multiplier. Something along the lines of BIP105 might be interesting (although it has its own flaws).
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:13:58
He's confusing a lot of terms. I noticed this in a video where he talked on UASF as well, he doesn't actually seem to understand the details of the BIPs flying around. Understandable, because there are so many, but still, kinda dangerous to make inferences based on false information.
* He's confusingly calling a chainsplit a "softfork".
* He thinks Segwit2X and Extension Blocks "create a situation where BIP148 won’t do anything" ie. avoid a chainsplit. Segwit2X could potentially do that, given some changes to its activation logic, Extension Blocks definitely don't (by themselves).
* Users can do their own replay protection by cointainting - the process of making a coin unspendable on one side of a chainsplit. Exchanges should freeze withdrawals (but deposits for tokens - not fiat - are still okay... should just slap a big fat warning on it that any reorged deposits will not be redeemed). Afaik the safest way to cointaint is to mix coins with post-split mining rewards (or coins with a history leading back to a post-split mining reward) on the legacy-chain; these transactions will not be replayable on the BIP148-chain.
* Exchanges can't demand wipeout protection of the legacy chain. It will simply never exist in any meaningful way. Miners may try to perma-hardfork but good luck getting that done in such contentious waters.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:51:06


I'm saying that it doesn't have it's own "separate" Segwit like you seem to think. You seem to think so judging from


It DOES work that way, Segwit2x "turns on" the existing Segwit, including for people who only run Core.


Wtf how do you do mandatory bit 4 signalling activated with bit 4 signalling that makes 0 sense. What would mandatory bit 4 signalling even do according to you?


Perhaps [BIP91]( is easier to read:




@_date: 2017-06-03 18:14:59
I think the official stance of that is [unscoped]( Doesn't seem likely to be included.
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:30:21
I think it's a relevant subtlety; miners are preventing a network upgrade that has widespread adoption. They are preventing **other miners to mine segwit**; the UASF is about boycotting this kind of malicious behaviour - not about forcing miners to mine segwit. Even post-segwit-activation, if only a minority miners actually mine segwit blocks that is totally valid, so it is not like miners are being forced to **do** something, they are just prevented from forcing others **not to do** something.
And totally agreed on the chain split avoidance; it is also why I am behind BIP148. (Of course, it wouldn't work if there was a coherent argument against Segwit; this kind of UASF only works because it is trying to activate something entirely beneficial).
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:35:34


So why is a coercive hardfork a reasonable response to this?
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:49:35
However BIP91 provides 0 guarantee, and outright incompatibility with BIP148 just seems like a design choice to ensure a chainsplit. Even with the most optimistic scenario of a retarget period ending on July 31, it is only possible to reach a 10/14 = ~71% signalling rate when starting signalling on July 21 (as scheduled) **when 100% of blocks signal bit 4**.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:37:49

On August 1 there **may** be some weirdness going on with the blockchain. Before that, you will want to extract your funds from any wallets/exchanges that don't give you full control over the so-called private keys of your bitcoin.
If you don't control the private keys you don't **have** bitcoin, you **are owed** bitcoin, and, well, if the entity that owes you them screws up you might lose out.

Hold your horses. Segwit2x now **is no longer definitely INcompatible** with 148. It's not necessarily 148-compliant. TL;DR on why everyone should still run BIP148:
* If Segwit2x is 148-compliant and you are running a 148-fullnode: nothing goes wrong on August 1.
* If Segwit2x is NOT 148-compliant (too slow to reach 80% signal rate) and you are NOT running a 148-fullnode: you might be on the end of a chainsplit that eventually gets reorganized into oblivion.

"Just increasing the blocksize" is what segwit does. If you are talking about a hardfork that doesn't bring any benefits besides a blocksize doubling that seems not worth the trouble; HFs are *very* expensive because the entire network needs to update in time, needs lots of coordination, long deployment timeframe, big media attention that everyone needs to update or be forked off etc. Doing that just for a static blocksize bump, especially one so small, seems like it's not worth it to me.

You should do some of your own research, but [this is a good place to start looking]( You'll want to make sure it says "Control over your money". If you want to trade during the split you should look into which wallets offer BIP148-compatibility; any wallet that lets you select a custom (trusted) fullnode will allow you to run a BIP148 fullnode and connect to it. If you just want to sit out the storm you only need to make sure you control the private keys.

The original version of BIP91 (without the expediated signalling timeframe) has been merged, presumably after testing from the signatories and [been hailed in the Alpha milestone announcement]( so I would presume that this is now accepted.
The expediated timeframe looks like it will get approval as well.

Segwit doesn't start on August 1st so this doesn't make sense. I suspect they are going to private-mine the BIP148 chain.

It's a reference to Ver's idiotic tweet.
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:45:48
It'll be clear during the signalling period itself that the block signal rate is ~80%, so there will be some warning, and they can run the code without signalling so they are protected in case signalling reaches 80%. I see orphaning of max 20% of miners as less disruptive than a chainsplit though.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:54:26
Depends on if you hold it on an exchange or in your own wallet. Holding on an exchange that does not offer chainsplit protection is VERY risky, I'd advise withdrawing funds long before August 1 (so you don't accidentally withdraw them too late). [Here's a good beginner's guide](

Both sides of the split have the same pre-split history, so any pre-split coins will exist on both chains ie. you will have 1 bip148coin and 1 legacycoin for every 1 presplitcoin you have. If my terminology or statement is unclear, please tell me, Ive been reading up on this so much Ive lost sense of what makes sense to someone who is new to the debacle.

It all depends on how strong BIP148 hashrate is at the start, how much it snowballs, etc. etc. Hard to predict. But you're right about their intent to start their "UAHF" ~12 hours after a BIP148 chainsplit.

@_date: 2017-06-17 12:46:25
"Hardforks are safe if you agree so you must agree so we can hardfork safely."
Well aside from that circular logic there's the fact that Garzik doesn't grok Segwit to the point of failing to increase the blockweight for his hardfork until called out indirectly by so there will need to be a LOT of review for the hardfork by consensus-layer-development experts which I haven't seen happen quite yet. Maybe it will be there, maybe it won't, but just saying a hardfork is safe if the community gets behind it is a bit naive.
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:27:18
I've been trying to get the BTC1 project to see that it is impossible to impose a coercive hardfork onto the network, because they seem to assume that they can somehow tie a softfork and a hardfork together like that. They keep insisting that the hardfork part of Segwit2x must be coercive otherwise Segwit2x cannot work.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:51:17
But no economic nodes are enforcing this, so it's essentially meaningless.
@_date: 2017-06-15 09:17:13
You can see the changes [here](
Of note:
* The signalling window is reduced from 2016 blocks to [672]( or one-third. So, signalling period of 4 2/3 days instead of 2 weeks.
* Starts enforcing mandatory bit1 signalling [immediately upon LOCK_IN]( rather than waiting another period.
With this, there are expected to be at least 1, perhaps 2 chances (signalling periods) for miners to reach 80% signalling on bit4 and lock in Segwit2x before BIP148 kicks in.

@_date: 2017-06-01 06:26:36
To be specific, it's a bug in the header formatting that allows a miner to craft blocks in a special way to be able to reuse partial hashes. This results in a 20-30% power saving on average per block hash. Segwit changes the header format and therefore breaks the stealth variant of ASICboost. For more details, [see here](

That's only one possible way to use the new script type, there's also the "native witness program" type that doesn't do this kind of P2SH magic.


Isn't that necessary to segregate the witness data, ie. the whole point of Segwit?


It was initially designed as a hardfork, so I don't think that is true. Iirc the only changes made to made Segwit softfork-compatible were moving the witness commitment into the coinbase transaction and setting up the blockweight calculation so that the "legacy" data (the legacy TXes + the non-segregated parts of SW TXes) took up no more than 1MB.


Wouldn't this have made old transactions invalid? E.g. those of the nLockTime variety? Making people unable to use previously-valid TXes is generally considered a no-go for an upgrade.

I think most of the BIPs in the 10X range concern blocksize, that's how I came across BIP105, but honestly the best resource is just digging through the mailing list, as much of a chore as that is... As far as I can tell it's still very much a question without a definitive answer (otherwise there would be a plan on the table for the community to consider).
BIP105 works by letting miners "vote" for a blocksize increase or decrease by a certain %, up to 10%. Voting for a blocksize decrease is "free", voting for an increase comes at the cost of additional POW difficulty to mine that block. I think that's not a perfect solution, but it's definitely one of the more interesting BIPs I've read wrt blocksize.

In their defense, Segwit2x has only just reached alpha status whereas Segwit is already well-tested, widely deployed and even active on some altcoins. They are essentially giving 2 qualifiers for what the hardfork part of SW2X needs to achieve before it can be taken seriously; technological maturity and community deployment.
If those are attainable for SW2X then you have nothing to worry about as someone who wants to see the hardfork happen. If those are not attainable for SW2X then you shouldn't want the hardfork to happen.
I'm a vocal supporter of BIP148, but also a big blocker and I completely agree with the Bixin statement; if a hardfork can fulfill these demands then I have no problem with it.

A signalling period is 2016 blocks, and then it has a LOCKED_IN period of another 2016 blocks after successful signalling, so probably at least 4032 blocks after mandatory signalling starts. (Could be more due to the fact that mandatory signalling start may not line up with a Segwit signalling period).
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:12:22


LN is a generalized, trustless aggregation mechanism that keeps things offchain. Why do we want to limit the chain to no bigger than necessary? Because yolo'ing the blocksize harms Bitcoin's anti-censorship properties.
And this is coming from someone who hopes Bitcoin will scale to the point where a bigger blocksize is necessary. High fees are however not something to completely shy away from; it provides high-volume users with incentives to optimize their transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:41:02
No, it will not start mandatory orphaning of non-signalling blocks until after another 2.33 day LOCKED_IN period. And also, it has to reach ACTIVE state **before** August 1st, so worst case we're looking at the last possible signal period starting 2.33*3 = 7 days before August 1, so 25 July.

I wrote this out in response to your deleted post but I'll respond it to this one instead since I already took the trouble to write it ;)




There's a difference between Segwit-**signalling** blocks and Segwit blocks. Segwit blocks are only considered valid after Segwit is locked in (this is just how Segwit works), Segwit is locked in with 95% Segwit-signalling blocks in a signalling period.


It will orphan non-segwit-**signalling** blocks while active, until Segwit is locked in.


If you replace segwit with segwit-signalling, that's correct.


Segwit2x doesn't have its own Segwit... It just reuses the existing BIP141 deployment that's rolled out in Bitcoin Core since 0.13.1; it activates this through mandatory bit1 signalling after bit4 locks in with 80% signalrate. So, BIP91 is essentially the mechanism that activates the Segwit part of Segwit2x.
As far as your concern about "getting segwit but not the HF"... That's inherently always possible; there is NO WAY to coerce a hardfork, it can only happen by making the hardfork nice/good/awesome enough for people to switch to it en masse, and that's very unlikely to happen if miners try to hold a softfork hostage. They will just get routed around.

The problem with that is how will miners "read" the node vote? BU/EC's node votes are trivially sybillable, so the only sane choice for miners is to ignore it, but then you just have miners unilaterally deciding the block size even though the network has to bear the costs of propagating and processing the blocks, which has a clear centralizing effect on the fullnodes.

Segwit2x uses [BIP91]( which is sort of like a miner-activated variant of BIP148.

Segwit2x/BIP91 locks in on 80% signal rate on versionbit 4, after it activates it will make versionbit 1 signalling mandatory until Segwit locks in.
Segwit2x doesn't have its own separate implementation of Segwit; it just makes activation of the existing one mandatory.

What if LN is so ridiculously efficient that 1MB is too big? What if LN makes Bitcoin so popular that 1MB makes fees so high one cannot close channels anymore because the onchain fee is bigger than the channel capacity? A blocksize that is responsive to the realities at hand is imho the right way to go, and BIP105 offers a mechanism to adjust the blocksize up *as well as* down as needed. The mechanism it uses to do so may be flawed, and more research on this may be required, but I think that if we are going to HF the blocksize, something like that is far more interesting than "hurr durr double the blocksize".

So far not much review of the hardfork code, but the softfork code has had a few expert eyes on it. Fortunately though you won't have to make up your mind about switching to it until the jury is out on the hardfork, because the softfork part is compatible with Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:44:30
Tweaking the difficulty settings downwards would violate the network rules and therefore be a hardfork.

Like I said, mixing with post-split legacy mining rewards can split unilaterally (without even needing a functional BIP148 chain). This means that 148-supporters can still dump their legacy hodlings.

THANK YOU. It is precisely the fear of this risk that has brought me to the BIP148 side, which is something I have publically stated many times. The only way to make sure this risk is moot is by preventing a chain split, which can only be done by making BIP148 a success.
It is only in the context of a permanent chainsplit (BIP148 as an altcoin) that created that my assertion stands.

I've been biting my tongue on Segwit2x, hoping that there was actually hope for a compromise. The project refused to adjust the timings to be compatible with BIP148 - something that was entirely within the lines set out by the New York Agreement and easy to implement; the guy who wrote BIP91 even made the necessary changes for it.
My intentions have always been to avoid an unnecessary chainsplit, but that is apparently "scope creep" according to BTC1, so I have no further interest in spending my spare time on helping in the development process.

Raspis and toasters aren't the point. The point is that Bitcoin, as the base layer, should be *radically* trustless. Everything is based on verification of cryptographic proof, not trust that third parties have verified the cryptoproofs. If you want to transact onchain, you need to verify the blockchain. How else are you going to "be your own bank"?

No, the game theory is that users choose to put more economic value on the BIP148-side of a chainsplit, and that miners will choose to voluntarily mine on that side of the split. There's also a sort of prisoner's-dilemma-esque mechanic in play where miners jumping on 148 creates danger for those mining legacy, making their rewards there potentially worth nothing because of a reorg, which will feedbackloop on itself to create incentive for laggards.

@_date: 2017-06-18 20:09:57
Yeah I've been explaining this on the slack a few times as well how it depends on the window timings, ended up making [this illustration](
From top to bottom:
* Grey/black: 10 days of signalling period (21 July to 1 August)
* Orange: old-style BIP91 with 4.67 day signal period and no LOCKED_IN grace period; best case 2 chances to avoid a chainsplit.
* Red: old-style BIP91; worst case 1 chance to avoid a chainsplit.
* Green: merged version of BIP91 with 2.33 day signal period and LOCKED_IN grace period (last color block is the LOCKED_IN period); best case 3 chances to avoid a chainsplit.
* Blue: merged version of BIP91; worst case 2 chances to avoid a chainsplit.
So it's a bit more variance-sensitive but overall I think the chances are slightly better. Of note: in the best case the last chance to get 80% hashrate on board is about the same (slightly in favor of old-style because it has a longer signal period to compensate if bit4 hashrate goes &gt; 80%), but in worst case the last period starts 2.33 days later in the merged version; a lot better chances for a successful chainsplit avoidance!
Still, absolutely no guarantees either way, so hodl that bip148 node close.

1 or 2, depending on the timings. There are 10 days with each signal period lasting ~4.67, so there's room for 2 but if we're unlucky it'll be something like 2.67 days left to a period starting July 21, then a whole 4.67 day period, then 2.67 days left for the last.

More than double; it allows blocks up to 4x as big depending on how TXes are structured (with an economic incentive to structure TXes in more efficient ways).

And so this one's descent into mediocrity began. It would not be until years later that they realized how much they had given up on. "Why did I abandon my hopes and dreams? For what? This?" they would think, "I could have done so much more with my life." Of course, failing to realize that they still had some decades left in them, they never took charge of their own situation again, lamenting their ironic lack of action for the rest of their life.

1-block reorgs are a common occurrence in Bitcoin anyway. With &gt;80% hashrate behind BIP91 enforcement I don't think there's serious cause to worry, and there is a 2.33 day grace period after S2X lock-in for miners to upgrade.

That's not how "expected value" works. It's about the number of throws you expect to do to get a 1. Which is 10 throws. If you're a bit shaky in your statistics, I recommend Khan Academy, they have some really great vids on this stuff.

Just a minor correction; the bug isn't in SHA, the bug is in the block header format of Bitcoin. Segwit modifies this header format slightly, which is how it breaks *covert* ASICboost.

I am aware, and that was precisely my point; true in some specific cases but on the whole it just makes things taste saltier. And yes, under some extreme restraints Segwit can make certain TXes more expensive, but on the whole it just makes things less expensive.

Please tell me, in concrete terms, what is this "soft-fork trickery"? How does it "gunk up" the design?
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:18:46


Various reasons, of which that is one.


I think there's a significant portion of people who are going to bunker down, until things settle for sure. I also think there's a significant amount of money that strongly favours the 148 chain to the point of being willing to dump legacy. Haven't seen much of the other way around though that may be perception bias due to me hanging around pro-148 people more.


Eh, not really, there is a core of people who are committed to 148 no matter what. I'm personally open to switching back to "legacy" and abandon 148 under certain conditions, but those seem exceedingly unlikely at this point.


It would be a nice tool for sure.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:25:24
Yes. All the "stripping of the witness data" is about is the optimization of long-term data storage in home user nodes; it is completely optional and only done after it is checked that the signature is valid. Firms that have a legal obligation or technical interest to store the entire blockchain for eternity, or simply enthusiasts who have the disk space to spare will still be able to do what they want.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:18:55
I'm open to considering Segwit2x if they step up, get their shit together and prevent a chainsplit.
So far they don't seem very inclined to.
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:19:46


Actually it is accurate, let's review.
1. BIP141 (Segwit) being active on the network **does not** mandate mining of segwit blocks or inclusion of segwit transactions (segwit-mining is optional).
2. BIP141 being active on the network **does not** mandate mining using segwit-capable software (by virtue of BIP9's mechanisms, mining software does not need to update; running a segwit-capable border node to validate incoming blocks from other miners is sufficient to protect yourself from malicious invalid-block mining).
3. Preventing BIP141 from being activated **does** prevent other people from using it (trivially true).
4. BIP148 does not consider blocks that prevent BIP141 from being activated valid.
5. Due to the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network, this does not amount a bouncer keeping people out of the voting area as this implies a centralized voting area. A more appropriate analogy would be a grassroots boycott based on a shared vision. In terms of [Andreas' analogy]( vegans who refuse to eat in a restaurant that doesn't offer a vegan option on the menu.

To the title: yes.
They will need to allocate more of their hashpower to the secret chain than the honest BIP148 chain has.
An interesting thing is that they can only effectively **increase** the total effective hashrate of the BIP148-chain at a very high cost (unless they secretly believe BIP148 will win in which case they are claiming all the early mining rewards).
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:57:04
Well, you could speculate, but if you want to play it safe, hodling is just fine. Make sure you don't have money in exchanges that aren't 148-ready by August, though.
@_date: 2017-06-21 06:57:04
Well you can't actually use BIP9 for a hardfork anyway. BIP9 is a softfork activation mechanism (in this case, adapted to be more speedy for BIP91) and you cannot tie a softfork and hardfork together. So, the hardfork part of the S2X codebase is not strictly needed to honestly signal bit4. I wonder if they will run the hardfork code if/when it is ready.
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:15:36
Yep, more tweaks got made since my comment, now there's going to be 2 or 3 chances for miners to lock in Segwit2x to avoid a chainsplit.
* The signalling window got reduced to 2.33 days.
* On the other hand, the mandatory signalling starts only after a lockin period.
This means that the last possible valid signalling period will start the latest 4.67 days before August 1 (2.33 days signalperiod + 2.33 days lockin period), leaving 2 periods before that (3 total) in the best case, and 1 period before it (2 total) in the worst case. This also alleviates criticism on the lack of grace period before enforcement starts, allowing laggard miners some chance to upgrade.
