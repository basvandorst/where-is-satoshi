This may be a good strategy, but I have noticed the volume to be abysmal and the prices like you said do tend to be a large amt higher. I will have to research it more, but thx for the suggestion!

First I would like them to implement letting my bitcoin be withdrawable before an entire week of business days go by when my ACH transfer finished in 3 days as reported by my banks online status....Really missing good plays on alt coins I like. May start buying btc on Coinbase again with cc(I just love dem fees!) just so I can time my buys better and get the coins I need.

Indirectly yes via mad financial gainz. Medicine ain't cheap yo.

This post gave me cancer... seriously guys there are so many types of crypto out there all trying to solve different things in the decentralized space. This is like saying a car manufacture is doing well so its not possible a boat manufacturer will ever succeed. Shameless plug go read about MaidSafe and the SAFENetwork, its my personal favorite project besides the good ole original BTC.

So many easy ways in code to fix this too. Put a limit cap on the requests per day would be a simple approach forcing users not to spam the functionality.

Once again, for users who don't know how to maintain wallet security on their laptop they could be at risk :) . I am sure I will find a niche, not really expecting the hardcore Bitcoin users to really wanna use this but who knows haha.

Does my account really look like a throwaway once you look into all my posts? The fact I mention my college, and that my username is actually my name :| ... If you want we can be skype and facebook friends! I was not even bashing CoinBase in that comment. Just offering a simple solution idea. I use CoinBase, they are the best way to purchase Bitcoins currently in the United States. Alongside BitStamp, they are the only other company I trust. They have had a few glitches and frustrations but that happens with the growth pains of any business. Oh and I will continue to use this one and only Reddit account for everything, nothing to hide or be concerned of here.

  All the info of the hacker is here. Can i get my 37.6 BTC now? 
@_date: 2014-04-24 23:46:19
Valid argument. I suppose a single payment to a person, then it would not be ideal. But if you are a vendor and you want to sell products via Bitcoin without having to use a site that makes you give a ton of your personal information we would be a good option. We also take out the hassle of running a local client on your computer, as well as tools to pay people on our site. I plan on making it instant withdraws eventually but I want to start off in a more secure environment early on. I won't be the site complaining how all our Bitcoin was stolen and we can't pay users etc..

I'm coding something similar to this and I don't need 1 million dollars start up. But mine is Bitcoin based only, because its the only currency I care for.

Well everyone has small server hiccups, so far Coinbase has been good to me. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:00:08
I don't think they magically put an order in for you, maybe someone else gained access to your account and put the order in for you. Otherwise I will need more context here. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 05:11:36
Idk, but from what I have read, brain wallets are not always the best bet.
Either way, I plan on using my site to bring Paypal like functionality to Bitcoin, with a flair of the freedom LR offered but without the drugs and illegal sales that powered it. 
And anyways it wont be IOU's, the coins that get deposited will not be lost or tampered with as long as our setup maintains security over our wallet that won't be located or tied to our website server at all. Regardless thanks for the input!

Oh god, I promise the text looked better formatted before the post, wtf happened.
EDIT- Welp seemed to have salvaged the post a tad hah.. 
@_date: 2014-05-05 03:09:08
They might wanna review the guns they sold them before they study bitcoin haha. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:54:41
Ehh, go on bitcointalk, you can find a decent amount of horror stories. Plus we have no idea who runs it, they chose to be anonymous for multiple reasons. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:36:04
And the storm has begun... 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:39:16
Never liked Gox, I always stuck with good old Coinbase and Bitstamp. Two reliable groups you should feel at ease with. The next processor to pull s*$% like this will be btc-e, mark my words.

The Safe Network should enable a decentralized github of sorts, still need the network complete but a POC of the git functionality was shown there.
@_date: 2018-10-03 04:42:18
At least MaidSafe and SOLID seem to be on good terms :) :
@_date: 2019-05-08 05:37:01
If this somehow actually happened all credibility with bitcoin would be lost, its meant to be a one way train, no reversing time here. Binance should employ better security, not try to force a redo like the ETH network did early on in life.

I care about a few things:
1. Time to verify/add a bank account tied to it.
2 Time it takes for my money to deposit from bank.
3. Fees/Price of bitcoin @ time of purchase.
4. Time it takes for my withdraw to process.
Coinbase pro is what I use now:
1. I have already gone through the hoops
2. Coinbase says banks may transfer in 2-3 days, but it takes them 7-10 days to validate it or whatever for them to see it, never understood this. Probably my biggest frustration with Coinbase now is this phase.
3. I pay about like 60 cent fee on a 200 dollar btc purchase. I consider that okay. The cost of  BTC on Coinbase is generally lower than most places. 
4. The withdraw time is quick, no problems here.
Is Square superior across all fronts? If so I would switch.

I feel your pain, went through that too. What really sucks is with the coinbase lag today, I am seeing charges I thought never processed due to site freezing now showing up 3 hours later, they better not charge me for something that was nonexistent on my account for about 3 hours :| . 
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:17:52
Well there is a lot of potential to sell to immature prospective customers! 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:02:03
I love how people post this crap after the fact. Maybe if you predict this stuff weeks in advance I would actually give you some credit otherwise its just stupid to reiterate what has occurred. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:50:29
Yeah big flash crash here for a few... And I need to go to sleep but if it hits 900 dollars on coinbase I need to buy it :| . 
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:02:29
Hit 870 at one point for me.. Went to buy and then I get the stupid, you have one pending transaction wait for it to clear.. FML I hate you coinbase.... bed time.
