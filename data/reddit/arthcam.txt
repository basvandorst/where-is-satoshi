If you're still uncomfortable about banter, it seems like r/bitcoinbeginners would be just the place for you. Because if you're old in bitcoin, it's impossible not to laugh or joke while your lifestyle is improving at incredible speeds. C'mon, memes are not that bad...

@_date: 2017-12-22 19:46:41
Okay, so you're unaware of the new "trustware" technology developed behind bitcoin, you also underestimate the power of a decentralised ledger, in which everything written there will remain written forever in history, I mean, that's incorruptible written data. Like it or not, it has its value, and one day people will realize that a full token inside this system is worth much more than 13 thousand dollars...

Yes, because a rich capitalist can only be called capitalist if the money came to him in a capitalist way; that is: people voluntarily gave him money in exchange for something they valued more than the money they were giving him. Any other form of acquired money (theft or taxpayer money) can't make of anyone a capitalist.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:48:03
Okay, enough. Back to r/btc, Snorlax... Don't forget anyone can see your post history and stop being such a sock puppet, please.

Oh, I see, you're one of the religious IOTA witnesses spread across bitcoin boards on the internet... There's this technology called "distributed network" where the more nodes you have, the more **trust** you get, and that's all that comes to mind when you're planning on turning a large portion of your hard earned wealth into crypto. But I'll just guess you're young, innocent and broke.

People voluntarily paying other people in exchange of something they want (or need) more than the money itself is the definition of capitalism. Prove me wrong.
@_date: 2018-09-21 11:25:15
Socialism implies that SOME human beings will have much more power over THE REST of the working human beings, therefore it attracts smart but corrupt people into places where the market wouldn't allow them to be.

Are you for real, isn't it obvious enough?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:17:58

It's insane to ever think that somebody agrees with a human being that thinks he's so enlightened that he has the power to remove value out of other people's wealth just for the sake of "moving the economy"... It's called "money as a system of control" and there's no other way you can call this, honestly... Pathetic.
Edit: Why would I ever want to spend my money? Well, money is a technology, it's a language which we use to comunicate value to other people in order to INCENTIVE anyone to do anything in exchange for that money. Let me choose when I ever want to spend it, please.

But look at the way he said "donate" instead of "donated" and haven't put a comma but a dot when saying he got scammed, like in:


Getting downvoted for trying to understand better what the commenter said... I even literally wrote down both options so he could pick what he meant. Jesus, it's forbidden to ask now.
@_date: 2018-09-21 11:28:30
Sorry, I'm afraid I didn't understand your comment correctly: are you saying that there's this one time when you got scammed or are you saying that you're never donating again because he apparently spent ₿0.015 ($100.00) on just milk and cheese?

I'd argue that computing power provably spent (PoW) can be considered a real asset. Various systems throughout the real world would benefit from such a strong network. Therefore mining force has its value and is backing each mined coin.

@_date: 2018-05-16 15:53:54
Okay, I'm going to give you the benefit of being forgiven for not understanding that Democracy is a lie because, again, you come from a country where the habit of cheating whenever possible is not the people's culture. But what we're trying to say (and I'm talking on behalf of u/CidVilas, and u/reddit_eats_babies) is: "Democracy" is told to be "The will of the majority" but in practice it always tends to "The will of the establishment of bankers and politicians pretending that the population has any voice or power". Men with power will, in most cases, act with their power on what's best for THEM first; the taxpayer is never a priority unless there's notorious public commotion about an issue. Democracy is about trusting on politicians, Cryptography is about trusting no one.

What about the ability to write anything in a public ledger that won't ever again be erased? Leaving a message and having it untouched and public for the rest of the computing history. Isn't that something to think about? No authority will ever undo or delete any Bitcoin transaction, this has far more value than I can think of.

@_date: 2018-06-29 17:16:33
Cards are second-layer solutions to transact centralized tokens between banks (depending on where you live, it's even toilsome to open an account) while the receiver of the funds is the one who pays for the transaction, and all your personal info can be directly linked to this "swipe" for whatever reasons anyone might be trying to assemble your purchasing profile based on where you spend your money, leaving your privacy in the hands of people you don't really trust. This might even seem logical to you, but there are others worried about basic ethics and fair trades beyond corrupted governments intervention.

You transact your coins to the wallet of the Lambo dealer.
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:02:56
Exactly! But I'm pretty sure there will be a consensus to increase the precision (more decimal places / fractions of bitcoin) before the year 2140, when it's predicted to be the halvening of the reward of 0.00000001 BTC per mined block, and therefore there will never exist such thing as "the last mined coin", as it could forever grow inward.
@_date: 2018-06-06 11:11:18
Okay, I wanna help you. First: where did you buy BCH thinking it would be BTC and didn't realize this until the purchase was already done?
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:06:24
1/8th of a Bitcoin (0,00000001 BTC) and also the name (or pseudonym) of the creator of Bitcoin itself.

Are you literally trying to convince anyone in the world that THE BITCOIN is a very centralized cryptocurrency? Why do you think anyone would throw their whole wealth on a centralized thing if it wasn't mathematically trusty? The difficulty for changing anything in the code through consensus is the exact same thing that gives value to bitcoin. In the era of the TRUSTWARES, only a few self-made multimillionaire retards care for fees so much in order to attempt a 51% attack on the most secure distributed network on Earth. C'mon.
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:30:42
You clearly don't know how things work in North Korea... Nobody moves without a reason there, the poor population doesn't even know there's a world outside North Korea, political propaganda is really intensive there. If bitcoin is being teached to the elite in Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, it means it's being teached to the governments loyal servants.
Edit: have you even read it? "There’s this feeling that a North Korean’s only motivation is to work for their country. By using Bitcoin, you can help regain some agency over your country’s finances, i.e., handle Bitcoin for the state."
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:38:39
If nobody does anything, governments will soon be weak before its citizens. But in my conspiratory mind I think that in the near future they will start tracking people's wallets and be aware of every transaction, therefore Monero, Dash and the like will be forbidden...

@_date: 2017-11-29 12:40:45
I think you got this all wrong. Please go back to your bcash subs.
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:36:21
And does Bitcoin needs to profit to maintain the service? Bitcoin started a trend of Decentralized development which gives the right incentives to the right people, so the system run itself without anyone ever be the owner and "profit" from it.

Trust me, if Satoshi is a living person, he'd never "file" anything on anyone.

Are you kidding me? The main thing about bitcoin (and its intrinsic value) is literally that it is simultaneously stored and synced on MULTIPLE hard drives at once, and it has the power to make it incorruptible for ever; can't you see the potential of having something in the virtual realm (outside any jurisdiction) which you can mathematically trust? You'll see past your box, one day.
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:59:30
Do you know what would be good for you that you can do right now? Try sending btc through a SegWit wallet paying 1sat/byte and getting it confirmed in the next few blocks so you can stop talking about things you don't fully understand. Bcash was a lie and you were deceived, you're just too proud to admit you have bet your money into a scam. Sorry for you.

@_date: 2018-02-03 18:12:46
Have you ever seen any bitcoins hacked or stolen? Through the network? The only things that can be hacked are private keys outside the network, it's impractical to hack the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:46:59
Saying that the most secure network in the world has no intrinsic value is, at least, dishonest of your part.

I once read that nodes on the mainnet are actually harmful for the development environment.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:17:07
That's where you're wrong, pal. Bitcoin's blockchain is the most secure system in the world because while "truth" itself is the most difficult thing to verify in the virtual world (the lands of the future), bitcoin does its role in guarenteeing that no information written in there is ever going to be altered. You're going to remember my words in like 5 years or so.
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:51:31
Do you guys really believe we have hit the bottom? I'm not looking for investment advice, just curious about your opinions.

Are you sure it's not just your bedroom?
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:16:06
But a bitcoin also isn't worth $58,065,210,000 (the number OP stated, which I haven't fact checked). So comparing that isn't as ridiculous.

The price of Bitcoin has dropped because demand has decreased and people lost confidence in it by the end of last year. Lightning is a decentralized network running "on top" of Bitcoin to validate smaller transactions until they get written into the blockchain forever. It means that you could send 1 satoshi to someone and they could send this satoshi forward in a way that it's viable and fast to use Bitcoin in a daily basis.
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:12:01

Never thought about it before... Makes sense.
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:51:11
No other system in this world has a dead king with an ideal, like bitcoin. Other systems are much more succeptible to centralization. And I hope you're not refering to systems owned by companies when you say there are more secure systems which process transactions faster.

Are you saying that just because all available funds can't be sent through a single input? As a user, I can say it's fungible... I treat mine like a liquid. Sometimes we shouldn't be so technical on bitcoin.

In your shoes, I would keep everything in crypto by default and only trade it for cash at ATMs when needed. But that's just me.

You're so delusional right now not to admit you were wrong in the first place that you're imagining a scenario in which a government would be aware of every single person-to-person trade (and you even call it "easier") to arrest or shoot somebody for sending encrypted text to a network. Please come back to your senses and see that it's impossible for governments to have control over p2p transactions.

Well, if your employer is reporting your income to the CRA, then you're also supposed to report it and pay the due taxes. For the calculation, I'd use the direct conversion from crypto to CAD on the very payment day like it wasn't even done in crypto.

So whenever anyone settles a futures contract, there's actual bitcoin purchases (although through an exchange) involved? I thought they were only done in fiat, from outside the blockchain or any exchange. In fact I never studied how it works, it was always a mistery for me. Good to know it helps drive the price of bitcoin.
