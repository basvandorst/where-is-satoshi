OK bitcoins are gone stolen blabla, what happened to the 70 million dollar fiat? 
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:37:20
Sorry I can't find the original source for that. Can't remember if he said it on twitter, reddit or irc. Probably on irc. 
You could ask him if you want to but he's pretty sick of the crap like everyone else. 
But it was definitely a big amount. Something that can't be explained with withdrawals from July 2013 -&gt; February 2014 unless they were missing a lot of money back in July 2013.
(Way more than the seized 10 million). 
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:40:13
Accounting fraud. In July 2013 Roger Ver said that mtgox was "solvent" he had been shown bank statements with around 100 million dollars in them.
In February 2014 there was like 10 million left of the ~80 million dollars owed to creditors.
Now where did all the money go? How do you not notice you can't fulfill your obligations to customers? It's also bankruptcy fraud. Once debt &gt; assets for a limited liability company and you ignore you're a criminal.

And the money in the bank accounts also got stolen by mining pools with enough hashing power?

@_date: 2014-03-23 16:22:27
Yes, I always have to laugh at little fangirls of nullc. 
"Claims that MTGox has a lot of coin so far look completely spurious to me."
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:41:59
I'm contributing by informing people about mtgox coins. I was the one who found the coins feb 27th.
The super smart developer tried to shittalk that discovery and later wants to get the credit for that and his retarded fanboys are sucking his dick and crying for his opinion everytime someone posts a theory just look at the posts the guy made that deleted his account. Just because you're a bitcoin protocol genius doesn't mean you know everything. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:31:20
So they are missing 1200 BTC and making around 60 BTC every 3 months? oh god
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:05:39
Of course they can recover, if they don't have to pay 850k bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:21:41
Of course it can't leak but if you pump through of all your paper wallets you can end up with 850k lost coins. 140 million bitcoin days were destroyed shortly before gox halted withdrawals. Those coins haven't been moved for 1060 days and then suddenly all of them moved in a strange pattern.
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:39:26
If you find something like this in your documents:
that is what you're looking for. Never show something likes this to anyone. This gives you access to the coins. 
This one has zero bitcoins in it. Your key might have a fortune. 
edit: seems like you found a brain wallet and not a paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:54:23
Using webarchive you can see it's sort of connected to the old mtgxo that was run by McCaleb. [mostly speculating though]
It's possible that his coins were still on mtgox and as a co-owner I believe 12%, he wanted to protect his coins from bankruptcy. If they were found on mtgox they would have been equally distributed to all customers. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:59:31
You send a small sum to the adress and back before you send the complete balance. That's like a noob check to see the adress works and is typed in correctly. Or that's some sort of withdrawal bug in some system? Just a thought. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:51:26
Behaving like the king of bitcoin and stating the obivous (everyone saw that shit on the api) isn't something special. Especially when one or two weeks earlier state that these coins don't exist at all LOL. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:58:47
May I remind you that nullc was completly wrong about the 200k gox coins and the community was right. 
The need for information is at this point bigger than the actual proof. You won't get proof without asking. The fact that 150k coins that have some connection to early mtgox are moving and causing one of the biggest spike in bitcoin days destroyed at the date when mtgox stopped withdrawals is more than suspicious. 
Stop crying for nullc. He might know a lot about bitcoin protocol that doesn't mean he knows everything that happens around mtgox. You rather want to stay in the dark because there is some uncertainty? Uncertainty isn't something logic people like nullc can handle very well. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:37:40
People don't realize we are transforming the medium of money. 
From Stone/Shells to Gold/Silver to paper money to then digital units(Bitcoin) and in the future we might change to energy and trade with pictograms of antimatter. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:30:07
Pseudoscience &gt; nerd logic. 
Instead of saying, wow you guys were right he said this: "I was actually the first one confirming mtgox had the 200k coins when they were moving them"
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:13:01
I don't care who you are or what you do. I will call people out if they tell bullshit especially when they have a large amount of fanboys who think everything is true what they are saying. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:21:50
So what happened? 
There are three possible scenarios:
1. Hacking
Other exchanges provided blockchain evidence and informed the police not 3 weeks after the hack.
2. Fraud
It's easy to bash on Mark. He bought bitomat to make customers whole. He promoted Bitcoin in several ways early on.
If it was fraud authorities would have gone full madoff on him. The reason for their silence so far is not because bitcoin is "unregulated". The legal framework for fraud works clearly for fraud.
3. Gov Seizure
Do you really think Mark is the sweetheart of banks and governments around the world? They don't like bitcoin, don't like mtgox don't like Mark. The international investigation for over 500k customers will take at least 1 or 2 years. It's no secret mtgox was used for money laundering, drugs and tax evasion. 
Silkroad, Shrem, Mtgox, Bitfunder/Weex have been the targets so far. Mpex and btce will be next. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:13:58
Can you think for yourself or do you need guidance? 
He was wrong, I was right. He can't admit it. I don't care. What I care about is this guy who is calling for him. So that he can post some well written bullshit about this theory and later claim he was right LOL. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 20:18:13
Because the site is no longer operational. The thing that checked incoming money and added it to your account was turned off long ago.
Also it doesn't really matter. Just keep it for your record and include it in your claims. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:05:05
McCaleb worked on ripple after mtgox, and he's  now moving to a new unknown project. He might be the owner of the coins and need capital for his new project. But if the coins were actually on mtgox, keep in mind they were moved around feb 6th there is a chance those coins illegaly were moved to protect them from bankruptcy. 
This is why this needs to be investigated. No need for proof cry babies. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:15:49
The community actually found them on feb 27th:
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:02:19
No. Even though his admin acess caused the first hack in june 2011. I don't think he's involved in stealing anything as he would robbing himself, but he certainly plays a role this time again. But more likely by hidding assets from bankruptcy. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:08:31
Ah yes the age of accounts is so important. I didn't document and post it because I don't care much about reddit. 
Your account can be 6 years old that doesn't mean your posts are better than those of an account 22 days old when you're posting outside your field of expertise. I guess you don't learn that in the detective school of reddit? 
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:16:34
Well I don't want to accuse him of anything yet. But he wouldn't the first guy trying to hide assets from bankruptcy. This needs to be investigated by someone who has the authority. It also has some tricky questions for bankruptcy lawyers. It's tricky to find out if coins were in the gox system or just on the blockchain in the hands of gox.
@_date: 2015-01-16 07:26:28
To be fair Mtgox took over some bitcoin exchange in 2011 or 2012. Bitomat.pl or some shit like that.
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:32:15
Mathematically impossible. The lower prices rapes the BTC creditors even more. 
At $200 we are at around ~24% (not including lawyer fees and other unknown bullshit)
At $300 we are at around ~26%
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:45:25
USD withdrawals were close to impossible and there was still money flowing into gox. 
Unicorns took it and ate it sounds more plausible. 
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:57:28
This is exactly why there is a gag order. DHS has been in their ass for over a year... 
It's just that bitcoin changes the game in general. You would need immense ressources for small criminals to catch them with their money aka bitcoins. The bitcoins are right in front of your face but you can't seize them if you're unlucky. They used secret special tactics to get them from Ross Ulbrich. 
This is why you do the following:
1. Seize exchange coins (Only place to get them easily)
2. Prepare international raids
3. Raid and hope you get as much as possible. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 07:58:41
Well the statement by Roger was about fiat. I think he saw bank statements with around 100 million dollar in July 2013.
Fast forward to Feb 2014. Not more than 10 million dollar cash remains.
What happened to it? 
@_date: 2015-01-16 07:18:40
some old research by (sorry forget the name meijklokes something):
@_date: 2015-01-01 11:08:56
Some guy who worked at Tibanne probably got blackmailed by organized crime. He stole the bitcoins or manipulated the price for the mafia to save his family. 
MtGox was an easy target for a ~200 million hit by organized crime.
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:08:04
BTC-e are the shadiest scammers out there, they won't help you. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 12:08:38
I remember that the bitfunder guy made some mysterious comments about the money.
He was like bla bla can't talk about it. Classic con artist shit or maybe some government intervention... 
@_date: 2015-04-22 07:26:05
According to my numbers around 57 million assets and 435 million liabilities.
57/435= 13% 
*The debt is inflated because they choose to use a price of 483 dollar per coin. This is bad for those who only had fiat on mtgox.
At market price it would look like this:
57/249 = 22,8%
@_date: 2015-04-24 16:19:11
If it was as early as the wizsec report says, the coins have switched a dozen hands since then. 
If they even existed in the first place. We will see higher claims than 750k. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 06:21:55
It just increases your pro rata share a bit. You buy one goxcoin for 200 bucks. You get around 0.25 BTC back worth 50 bucks. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 05:15:46
It's hard to look at the historic addresses by browsing the blockchain. 
Wherever the money went, it's not there anymore. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 08:41:02
If you can file your claims through kraken. If not enough people do this, the 202k coins will be auctioned off and it will take at least a year longer to get the money and probably at a worse price. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 14:18:14
It includes 73 million dollar fiat liabilities and around 80k btc supposed banned accounts, also some guys won't file their claims. 
The supposed Tibanne claim will go right back to creditors because they owe mtgox 7 million.
