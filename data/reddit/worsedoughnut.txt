You're actually *too* creative. Knock it off.

Curious, what would you have included on the pamphlet to convince/inform non-tech people who want "money that just works"?

Hi, I'm really sorry, I've read all this through, but i still have almost zero clue how to actually get and use bitcoin.
You have a list of where i can buy it, and a list of "software wallets", but i feel this doesn't explain much in terms of how to actually use them (the wallets and sellers).
Unless I'm mistaken, and this isn't a FAQ about how to use bitcoin, and is instead just an FAQ *about* bitcoin. 
Maybe I'm asking too much, i don't mean to seem like i don't understand technology; if this was any other tech I'd gladly just fuck around with it until i figured it out, but this is money. Not saying banks are better (trust me i support the concept of bitcoin 101%) but even for someone keeping up with technology like me, banks still "just work". Where as right now, in terrified to start anything because i have no idea what will happen.
I can't count the number of times I've seen posts here about previously-widely-used-services being less than honest. Is the guide on the "Getting Started" link up to date in that regard? 
I guess what I'm saying is, there should really be a step by step guide, not just a list of relevant links and software, or at least an obvious link to one if it already exists.

Does using a 3rd party like Circle shoot myself in the foot at all? I'm an information security guy, so I guess I'm looking for something i know i have more direct control of.

Telling them things they can already do shows them that it can beuseful in some of the same ways as their normal currency. 
It seems like you're not really interested in getting the non technical demographic onboard. 
Also, I'm can't say I'm really that interested in bitcoin at this point. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:33:40
I wasn't "fed" anything. I'm a information security guy, so a decentralized currency like bitcoin as a concept is extremely relevant to my interests. I'm just not interested in using it personally.
And it's not even remotely similar to "sales", but I see that your ideal use case for bitcoin is very different from mine, so I'm done with this discussion.

How does that work when you're trying to inform people who have no connection to that part of the process though? I don't do any of those things, so if you told me that's what bitcoin was for, I'd write it off immediately.
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:08:38
But why waste the opportunity to get some people who don't *need* bitcoin to at least become interested in it? Just because it's helpful for people with poor banking systems doesn't mean you should restrict it to only those people.

And rather than use the opportunity to try and appeal to end users who might choose the more secure of the two (between Bitcoin and VISA), you'd shoot down those attemps in some weirdly elitist rationalization? 
Encryption has value to *everyone*. Everyone *needs* encryption. People like you aren't helping.

Great post, too bad this sub is missing the point and is busy attacking you.
@_date: 2016-02-15 21:19:17
Sorry, but it's people like you stopping growth and widespread adoption. Sentiments like yours are what will doom bitcoin to staying a niche market forever.

Maybe he goes every year.
@_date: 2016-09-19 15:26:48
This post alone has made me decide that Bitcoin isn't worth the trouble if I just want to buy something like a video game.
*Disclaimer: I'm not really sure why I'm still subbed here, since I've been told I'm not the target demographic for bitcoin.*
@_date: 2016-09-19 21:00:54
Okay, so you're just an asshole? Got it, thanks!
@_date: 2016-09-19 16:10:22
Oh I completely agree. I just wish I was smart / patienet enough to wrap my head around it now.
@_date: 2016-09-19 20:53:22
Excuse me? Why are you being so hostile?
@_date: 2016-05-04 14:06:52
Haha, was not expecting to find a reference to that here.

Does the bot only allow for tipping between viewers and the streamer, or can viewers send tips to other viewers?
@_date: 2016-05-02 03:10:20
I can't tell if this guy is trolling or not, all his comments here are too funny.
