in my country there is no fee for cash atm withdraw. 
up to 250 euro day, and 1500 month no pay 1 single cent.
also the bank account has been totally free for years... i usually store 1000-3000 euro there.
no taxes paid as long as you hold less than 5000 euro average... otherwise is 7,55 euro each 3 month.
i left no more than 3000 euro, i paid costanlty 0 euro a year. 
i can withdraw cash, still 0 euro commission
i can pay with plastic card, still 0 euro commission
i can do a sepa bank wire transfer, still 0 euro commission.
worked it for years... at least from 2010 all these 9 years... sadly this is coming to an end.
soon the new tariff in place will be a fixed cost of 1 euro a month, so 12 euro a year.
other conditions didn't change.
i know people can pay more money outside my country, and using some banks... but here there are some banks with very low fees, has been for years.
in 2007 i got pissed off as i was paying like 300 euro a year for bank, they used any justification to charge you money... oh look we did this: 2 euro !, oh look you did this 2 euro ! and it all added up.
i simply change bank. they told me: your bank account is special we do not do these deals anymore !
sure you do not do them, cause nobody would buy. the bank account was my mother's bank account, she had it for more than 20 years and got fleeced.
in 2007/jamuary 2008 i change bank, now i only pay 65 euro a year instead of 300...
the previous bank insisted everything was ok, while it wasn't ok. they didn't care about a 20 year loyal customer... they offered to cut prices only after i said we would close the bank account and transfer all the money within somewhere... suddenly doing X or Y operation could be done without costing any money...
too late i say, why should i stay when you offer the same things other banks offer ?
why should i stay in a place that didn't care to lower costs, without me doing a drastic measure ?
after moving bank 2 years later i moved to a new bank that costed 0 euro a year... and stayed till now.
now i checked banks around for my mother, the old bank is still a bloody vampire... i guess i can stay in a bank if it costs only 12 euro a year... if they will spike other prices again, i will look around for opportunity.

you u.s.a. people have different views of
1) freedom of speech, and socialism
in europe we jail people who incite hate and murder, you just have school shootout... to each its own culture.
we also kick from the country people who spew terrorism.
2) i like socialism, like in europe, and i call venezuela a dictatorship... just like china, north korea, iran, saudi arabia etc. some of them are just poorer than others, but usually their people are without freedom and miserable.
3) here in europe i can have all gay sex i want, without getting beaten or jailed... plus even free healthcare.
@_date: 2019-07-28 19:19:27
blecki is correct.
you just use venezuela to attack europe.
i tell you, if i have to choose between venezuela and u.s.a. ... i would pick europe.
less crazy people, less public shooting, less religion, less demonization of nudity...

very nice... as a gay without bitcoins i got no bitches (not that i care)
still if i was so crazy to buy bitcoin (i would lose them for sure within 5 minutes)
still if i was so crazy to buy bitcoin i would just cash some of them out and go to live in a country with less taxes (but still a country enough safe to live in without getting robbed/killed :D)

technically my sweet spot price would be 5500$ (i would sell as low as 5500$), but i simply decided not to risk anything so i have 0 btc :D
still if i had 10.000 or more bitcoins:
i would buy a house in a fiscal haven and invest 10 million $ in s&amp;p and 12 million € in euro stoxx 600
rest would stay in btc, multi sig wallets 3of3, the kind of wallet you need 24 words to rebuild from scratch
probably split in 20 multisig wallet, so i would need to carefully store 60 private keys, and 24\*60 words to rebuild them

i think it isn't possible to sell all in 1 day unless you sell only 100.000 $
spend 0.5$ / gain 5 btc / sell 5 btc / gain 100.000$
this thing makes more sense: buy 10.000 btc for 3000 to 60000 $ then sell each btc for 5000$ or more
you have 50.000.000 or more millions aiming for selling everything at 20.000$ means waiting other 5-10 years and hoping btc still exists by that day.

congratz on the winning, but be careful many things you did were wrong...
1) i would tell noone if i had bitcoins
2) i wouldn't buy bitcoin because i know it is very EASY TO LOSE them...
(i do not consider myself as negated in using computers, it is just this bitcoin thing is still immature, of course in 2009/2010 was even worse)
my suggestion would be to put the money in stock... either 5000$ in a single stock, from 100 stocks handpicked from standard and poor 500
or 50 stocks 5000$ each, from standard and poor 500, and 50 stocks from eurostoxx 50 (in euro) and just watch in 5 and 10 years what you gain.
this way you have 100 different stocks, each weighting 1% and you cover good stocks, either 100% in usa, or 50% europe and 50% usa...
by the way i am no good in finance, so my advice is from am inexperienced person :D

interesting... this is the reason i didn't jump in on the bitcoin wagon when i first found it, i think it was in late 2009/early 2010 and 1 bitcoin was worth 1 cent
i imagined since 1 bitcoin was worth so little, that they would be generated fast, after about 45 minutes that none got generated on my computer i tried to identify the problem, i found i couldn't open the port since i couldn't enter my router settings, i didn't think i could buy a new router, i thought i could change my internet service provider to the previous one, since with the previous one i could open any port i liked with the router given to me by the company.
then i just forgot about bitcoin, when price surged to 10 cents i realized that recently i changed internet service provider to a new one, the new one was even worse... i got an optical fiber internet in 2010, with 10mbit upload/10mbit download speed... the price to pay was being behind a nat and not being able to open internet ports
in 2011 on july i had about 50.000 euro in a saving account and was looking for way to invest them, i saw a file locker service accepting bitcoins and i thought that i could buy at least 2000 bitcoin for 20.000, but then getting a bitcoin wallet + signin in on an exchange + learning how to do the trading was too much bother, i also had no idea about the concept of liquidity of an asset, buy and sell, the book.
in 2013 i just researched bitcoin with a bit of curiosity, didn't plan to buy at 500, i found it out full of russians/chinese/n. korean hackers, full of stories of hackings, full of stories of people losing coins... i checked out the paper wallet thing, the tutorial about having a laptop, disconnecting the wifi module, installing linux which i barely knew how to use, setting up a cold wallet... then i thought... why even bother ?
@_date: 2019-11-19 01:50:38
you ask: why people do not buy bitcoins ?
1) too hard to use (difference between windows and linux)
2) there can always be an alternative in the future... 
(when the euro currency was created, you could convert the old currency into the new one... that most likely will not happen IF FabolousCoin will gain 90% market share, and almost everyone will use it, and Bitcoin would crash to 1$ :P)
@_date: 2019-11-22 01:34:51
my calculations tells: 100.000.000 $ at 7500$ per coin = 4666 $ at 0.3 $ per coin + 5% expenses to use paypal included.
with 5000$ you could buy enough to have 100.000.000$ and you had all 2010 and january 2011 of time to buy it.

ok :D
italy... we have no way near the level of scam of nigeria, then only scam exists in a city in the southern region of our country, called napoli...
it was also depicted by the jojo bizarre adventures manga as a city of scams...
" 
To provide contrast to the previous installment “Diamond is Unbreakable”, the scene switches from Japan to Italy.
Giorno is a student in Naples at the beginning of the story, committing minor grifts to get pocket money. This attracts the attention of mob enforcer “Leaky-Eye” Luca. In the ensuing confrontation, Giorno inadvertently ends up killing Luca with the power of Gold Experience, which instills life in objects for various effects. While it wasn’t his plan to do that, Giorno is not particularly upset.
The mysterious boss of *Passione*, the organized crime syndicate that rules Italy, is rather more upset, and orders Bruno Bucciarati to investigate the death. Bucciarati, whose Stand Sticky Fingers allows him to create zippers on any surface, quickly figures out that Giorno is responsible, and battle ensues.
The two young men gain each other’s respect during the fight, and we learn that both Giorno and Bucciarati hate the fact that Passione is involved in selling addictive drugs to children. They believe that gangsters should protect the weak, and form a plan to overthrow the current boss. One big problem: the boss operates through numerous cutouts to the point no one knows who he actually is!
After Giorno passes an initiation test, Bucciarati introduces him to the rest of Bruno’s elite team. Abbacchio, a former cop whose Moody Blues allows him to recreate past events; Mista, a slacker whose Sex Pistols allow him to control bullets and make impossible shots; Narancia, a runt whose Aerosmith Stand summons a tiny fighter/bomber plane; and Fugo, a genius with a temper problem and the deadly Purple Haze Stand that releases a flesh-eating virus.
In short order, Bucciarati becomes *capo* of Naples, and then is given a new and highly dangerous assignment. It appears that unknown to everyone including the boss, the boss has a daughter named Trish who recently lost her mother. The team must deliver her safely to the boss, battling other traitorous elements within Passione who believe that capturing Trish will give them a hold over the boss in some way.
And just as the team thinks they’ve accomplished that mission, there’s a new twist!"

homophobe masked as a concerned person...
like when in poland they have catholic church pedophilia sexual scandal, but suddenly it is the sex education teachers that goes to jail since they are the one blamed into corrupting minor... while they are just giving knowledge to minors that can be used to avoid pregnancy when still not financially independent, and be able to figure how when someone is try to sexually abusing you and therefore report the attack.
an ignorant minor about sex is an easier prey for catholic pedophile priests as the minor doesn't know what is allowed or not allowed and has no clue... also without knowledge the minor may follow instinct and find him/herself with a child to raise up when still in need to gain education and financial independence.
so the concerned right winger is preoccupied about a sex education teacher who is actually doing a good work to protect children and make them wiser... while concerned right winger doesn't care at all about the whole pedophilia scandal of the church.

people could hate me for saying this... but you could soft fork a system where if a satoshi isn't spent in 100 years, then it is reassigned for mining.
suppose 50 bitcoins are lost, you soft fork, a timer starts, after 100 years those coins are scheduled to be assigned to a random miner who confirms a transaction...
it could be 0.001 lost bitcoin per transaction, so you got no more lost bitcoins :-)

my home is worth 120.000 euro, i pay 665 euro a year for home property tax (0 euro) + garbage collection tax (90 euro) + apartment management expenses (575 euro)
i could rent something similar where i live for 7800 euro a year.
how the hell do i get 7225 out of 120.000 with low risk when every financial product is overpriced ?
i would need a NET return of 6.02% on the money to just break even.

i never bought a bitcoin, but i checked around the prices... so far kraken site and coinbase pro site seems the one with affordable fees and site i could give some trust... my idea would be to use them, and then immediately withdraw the funds fiat/bitcoin leaving nothing on them once transaction is done, also not putting too many bitcoins on them, trying with max 1 bitcoin worth of value first.
