Even given a 3 week rejection time, i'm still ~3 days past that (I don't know how exact to the 3 weeks it need to be though). And yeah I noticed the blocktrail link shows expired, but the blockchain link still shows unconfirmed. When looking at the details for the transaction in Electrum, it still just says Unconfirmed, and when looking on blockchain.info's site it says the transaction is still 'pending'.
Guess I don't have any option but to continue waiting it out and hopefully it gets rejected soon and I can up the fee?

Hey guys, hopefully someone can help me shine some light on my situation. On December 12th I sent some bitcoin from my blockchain.info wallet to my electrum wallet with an extremely low fee of 20sat/KB (bad idea). The coins have been stuck in limbo since and it was to my understanding that it would either be eventually picked up or rejected by the blockchain within ~2 weeks.
Well it's been just over 3 weeks now and the coins are still unconfirmed and haven't been returned to either of my wallets... So I was just wondering what my options were. I'm not in a huge rush for them, I just want to know they are safe and I didn't mess anything up (which is why I wanted to move them from blockchain.info to begin with).
The TX id:
UPDATE: After messing around with things for a while, I ended up importing my blockchain.info seed into an Electrum wallet and tried to resend the funds through there... AND IT WORKED! As soon as I tried sending the funds from Electrum I got an two emails from blockchain.info letting me know my tx failed and that my funds were returned to me. Hurrah!
