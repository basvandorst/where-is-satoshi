Without verification you have a 24h withdrawal limit of 2 BTC (or equivalent other currencies). With Verification it's 100 BTC

No, they don't provide any more support for Segwit than Coinbase. Both can send bitcoin to segwit addresses - but that's nothing that needs implementation.
They both send from non-segwit addresses and the deposit addresses they generate are also non-segwit.
Edit: They might "support" segwit, but as long as they're not actually using segwit transactions they play the same role as coinbase in keeping the fees high. The only reason nobody complains about Gemini is because they pay the fee themselves (like GDAX).

So where do I see my segwit address then? Being ready doesn't mean they're using it.

Can I provide my Bitcoin Cash address instead? /s

You took a photo of your screen \- so surely there was a laptop or computer? Or just take a screenshot on your phone? Either way \- probably pointless to elaborate further. Sturkopf.

It's quicker, easier, looks better, uses less space \(way easier to compress\). Just to name a few. You might not care, others do though.

I think he was also hinting to use your computer to take a screenshot instead of taking an actual picture with your phone...

What is that weird thing next to the external hard drives? Not the AirPods but the heat sink and the fan. Unless it's just sitting there but it looks like it's plugged in/powered?
