The price dropped majorly back when he first spoke out, but China happened on the same day, so who's to say who, what, where. But I love that no one cared this time round: Like dude, you had your say. Shut up already. Did you see that ad one startup took out in the WSJ to market themselves based on his comment? Classic.

Fake news when all the major news outlets covered it?

There's a blockchain panel discussion at AfricaCOM, largest tech conference in Africa, next month. Awareness is super slow but it's not completely dead. My concern is Africa looking to the West (again), when this could be a real opportunity to build out from the ground up. But there's companies like BitPesa making headway. Slow going though, Africa needs more champions.

Lol not even a single thread to celebrate the power of the creative spirit before we start thinking like traders again.

Wow. Thanks for sharing. It's astonishing that no one writes about this in reference to bitcoin.

You better buy in today, or it'll be only shelf space by tomorrow.

Bitcoin real estate is driving free publicity for sure. Read an article about the rise of the bitcoin property market the other day and can't help get the feeling with some sellers it's less cos sellers want bitcoin, more cos they have enough to make them want you to have some, too, so the price can hitch a hike. But hey, whatever works.

Can you explain why you say they're still alive because of it? Context?
