Your private key must be embedded somewhere your bitcoind process can get to it, in order to run that command.
Inside a proprietary wallet, likely you will need to contact the developer and have him run the command with your private key. Only he will know how to get to his bitcoind, within his application.
Next time use the standard bitcoind wallet.

No different than USA.


Their system is different. China has a higher standard of living. They are guaranteed a home. USA has a homeless epidemic. Capitalism is completely failing. It cannot feed nor educate a society. 


Nothing wrong with science classes for theist.


They own Taiwan. It belongs to China. The US has no business sticking their nose in Chinese business.


Try getting a clue.

-zapwallettxes=&lt;mode&gt; 	Delete all wallet transactions and only recover those parts of the blockchain through -rescan on startup (1 = keep tx meta data e.g. account owner and payment request information, 2 = drop tx meta data) 
Thats how you get your coinz back.
