How is the book overall?
@_date: 2018-09-20 04:07:51
I have heard of it before. Sounds like it requires a few steps with some limitations to the addresses. Idk
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:31:17
Intrinsic value.. BOOM

They likely wont be able to spend it. I have small transactions that is considered "dust" and my wallet wont cash it. :(

Anything is better than fiat.

Those 8 little dudes at the Federal Reserve keep ~~printing~~ typing those un-backed "I owe you's" endlessly.
@_date: 2019-11-12 05:12:44


You said you didn't read it, then you call it "drivel". So did you read it or not? Confused here. How can one respect your opinion if you don't know yourself if you know whether you read it or not?


People were eating before the Federal Reserve, wtf are you talking about. People are eating without the 8 little dudes in their lives as well. 


So you are saying thank the 8 little dudes are the reason why society is where it is at today??
Somebody is riding 8 little dudes dick.

I wonder if Schiff personally verified all his gold holdings.
@_date: 2019-08-21 17:02:25


Technically, there is a LOT of fake gold out there.
Bitcoin is basically automatically verified real by miners.

And we all know fbi agents don't lie or show bias /s

Great comment!!
@_date: 2019-02-02 22:02:14


Ummmm, No. :) 
Enjoy following me :)
@_date: 2019-06-15 15:49:14
Just checked it out. Seems like there is very low limit of .0065 which is around only $50. That is insanely low.
@_date: 2019-12-14 20:47:20
And/or are the 8 little dudes who own the federal reserve so distasteful?
@_date: 2019-02-02 17:15:14
Thanks for providing your well thought out plan to the conversation. You and that other person with your lack of actual involvement and input are hilarious!! HAHAHAHA 
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:50:46
how much cash is inside? software?
@_date: 2019-02-02 21:57:38
By you, yes. By anyone else, hell no. Low expectations for you. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:03:28
Sounded like a musical beat at the beginning.
@_date: 2019-01-29 05:13:58
What do you suggest?? HAHAHA
@_date: 2019-01-31 00:55:19


How do we get here?
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:49:51


Yes it is. They want to tax people even more though. WTF!!?
You said you want to start a petition to shut down the IRS? Is that what you said? Where do I sign?? :)
@_date: 2019-01-10 00:18:57
This is fire.
Idk who memes better, here or T_D 
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:59:45
You have several pages of history. I am interested in what your opinion is. Please provide a specific link. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 03:37:02
HHAHAHA  And why are we "dumb as fuck" in your opinion?
@_date: 2019-01-29 05:24:37
HAHAHA.... You do you. You don't have to sign :)
@_date: 2019-01-29 05:18:17
HAHAHA What are you going to do? :)
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:22:44
This is smart. This actually is a good way to tell how many true hodlers have come aboard. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 00:05:52
Actually, it will be even more if the gains of the different branches of the original are included.
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:49:11
I know what you mean. But we shouldn't have to hide shit.
@_date: 2019-01-31 01:27:06
You are referring to 
@_date: 2019-01-29 04:06:18
It is a step in the right direction, no?
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:38:19
Fuck the IRS. The gov send billions of funds to Israel, Afghanistan, and Venezuela, among others. Yet, the gov wants to nickle and dime us over trading coins?? GTFOH
@_date: 2019-01-14 18:10:17
Thanks for the reply. I just reached out to him to see if his bot is compatible with our project. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 00:47:40
Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2018-03-03 21:22:03
@_date: 2019-09-18 18:35:11
Meaning the tax payers would have more "control" over the money printing instead of that private company.
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:40:21
Thank you. I agree with nearly everything you said. And yes, the source code is definitely more important than the white paper. 
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:38:34
What would happen if the federal reserve private company was fired, and congress could create money without the use of the private federal reserve? what differences would there be?
@_date: 2018-12-18 03:31:13
Everyone who drives a car isn't a mechanic. Why do you all expect people to desire knowledge about something even more irrelevant than a vehicle that their life depends on?
