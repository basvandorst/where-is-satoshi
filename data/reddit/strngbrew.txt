Only he's bought a lot of companies and taken them private. So it's hardly just "stocks."
Look at Buffett's portfolio. He mostly buys whole companies at this point and therefore makes money off the profits from their operations, not the ebb and flow of their stock price.
Now go and see and if google can help you find any USA Today articles that refute that ;-)

I agree. You only hold Tether to facilitate trading on exchanges where you can't use USD. So if you don't want to hold any Tether, you are most likely just redeeming it for fiat.
