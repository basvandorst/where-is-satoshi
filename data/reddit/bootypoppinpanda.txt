Can someone please address the following issues here: asking for who has presented these concerns to me, but I don't have the knowledge to understand some of these concerns:
Essentially, lightning only works as a scaling solution when everyone is already using it. It has no way to bridge the gap from no users(where it is starting) to everyone worldwide using it.
Worse, it has numerous tradeoffs that will discourage the average person from using it. This amplifies the downsides that arise from it not being universally in use instantly, and will prevent it from ever reaching that state. Here are those:
* You must be online all the time to be paid. And the person you want to pay must be online for you to pay them. 
* If you go offline at the wrong time and aren't using a centralized hub, you can lose money you didn't even knowingly transact with. 
* The solution to  is to enlist "watchers" to prevent you from losing money. More overhead the average person isn't going to care about or understand, and more fees that have to be paid. Or people will just be forced to use centralized hubs. 
* Two new users to Lightning will not be able to actually pay each other without using a centralized hub because no one will lock up funds into the opposing side of their channels; No funded channels = can't pay eachother. Hence... Hubs. 
* Using hubs will come with monthly fee; They aren't going to lock up their capital on your behalf for no cost. 
* The entire system is vulnerable to a mass-default attack. Hubs are especially vulnerable. 
* Hubs will only be based in developing nations. KYC requirements will close down any successful hubs in developed nations 
* Lightning will not be able to route large payments(no route available). 
* Lightning transactions are larger than normal transactions. 
* Lightning nodes must keep track of the full history of channel states themselves. If they lose this, they are vulnerable to attacks and may lose coins. 
* Attackers may randomly lock up funds anywhere along the chain of channels for extended periods of time(many hours) at no cost to themselves. 
* The network randomly may fail to work for a user under certain circumstances for no discernable reason as far as they can see (no route available) 
And the issues directly related to the not having everyone on the planet on lightning at first:
* Small payments consolidating into larger ones, such as a retailer who needs to pay vendors, will fail to route on Lightning, and the loop between the source of the payments(end users) and their destinations(retailers) is broken. This means every channel will "flow" in one direction, and need to be refilled to resume actually being used. 
* Refilling every channel will be at least one onchain transaction, possibly two. If this happens twice a month, 1mb blocks + segwit will only be able to serve 4 million users. Some estimates are that Bitcoin already has 2-3 million users. 
* Regardless of lightning's offchain use, Bitcoin must still have enough transaction fees to provide for its network security. Except instead of that minimum fee level being shouldered by 1000 - 500000 million transactions, it is only shouldered by ~170 million transactions with segwit 1mb blocks. 
I'm not of the opinion that lighting is WORTHLESS... It just isn't a scaling solution. Lightning is fine for use cases that need to do frequent, small, or predictable payments with few entities. For example, mining pools paying PPLNS miners. Or gamblers making small bets on gambling sites. Or traders making frequent trades on exchanges.
But as a general purpose scaling solution for average people? It sucks, and they are absolutely not going to go through all of that shit just to use crypto, especially not with better, cheaper, more reliable options out there.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:27:19
What you say may totally be true, but you haven't really provided any further insight. Just because you've used it doesn't mean it'll scale that well either. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:17:20
Network effect. Learn about it. The internet you use is not the best and most efficient implementation either. Why are you still using it you may ask? Because everyone else uses it, ya dingus! Try getting the world to switch internet protocols "cuz it's better."

Tell that to people in Greece or Venezuela who literally cannot trust the currency they use, and all of their savings got wiped away by a failing government. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:14:36
Nope, my argument for bitcoin appreciating greatly is people realizing it's a new asset class with features never seen before. One of it's applications is the most sound form of money the world has ever seen. 
Its first network effect is speculation, and given bitcoin's coin cap, the more people that learn about it and buy it will increase the price. 
Once this network effect has gained enough traction, merchants will begin accepting it as payment, creating further and stronger network effects.
Looking at Metcalfe's Law, the bitcoin price will increase exponentially as the number of people transacting and using the system increases.

How many nodes are going to be necessary once average Joes get into the game?
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:10:18
This graph is extremely misleading and does not predict shit. At every single peak leading up to ATH last year, people were calling bubble, and the price surged for months afterwards.
The price could also continue to surge in 2018 and hit 50k, and this month on the zoomed out graph would look like just another blip.
This is the speculation game, and nobody fucking knows where this thing is heading. Make your own decisions and have a risk management plan.
This graph is nothing but fun with guessing games.

The Euro has an incredible amount of politics involved between many countries. The rules and strings attached change all of the time. Bitcoin doesn't change the rules, and you can opt in or out whenever. It is much more sound money because you know the rules, anyone can play, and no one can take your shit or inflate the supply to devalue your savings.

@_date: 2018-01-09 17:49:20
Yes, 2 and 3 are extremely important, and bitcoin has by far locked these in as main priorities. All the cryptos use  as a backbone for the tech. Bitcoin being the most secure and focusing on the most important qualities rather than bells and whistles that many alts are offering at the expense of decentralization and security makes it by far the strongest coin. It's hard to see that now because bitcoin is basically unusable at this time due to increased demand, but there seem to be promising scaling solutions on the horizon.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:01:48
Bitcoin is 9 years old and not even mainstream yet. It started from absolutely nothing and has made it this far. You are being naive to think this phenomenon doesn't bring a new value case. Let me know how those negative interest rates on your savings are going when they inevitably come.

I wasn't around then for it, far from it actually, but I believe you had to meet up with the people if you wanted to buy BTC, but easier than that, you could just mine it easily with a regular computer. 
There were also bitcoin "faucet" websites that literally *gave* you BTC for funsies to play around with. Crazy right?
@_date: 2018-08-16 23:01:23
Yeah, that was I how I felt when I first started too. My bet is that 16k will feel pretty good in 5 years. I'm just a random dude on the internet though ;)

You are comparing the adoption of two very different things. Facebook is easy to understand and is more fun when you get all of your friends involved. Bitcoin is hard to understand, you have to put money into it and secure it, and it will make you the outcast of the party if you bring it up. IMO it's not the number of users that will cause the btc price to explode, but when big money from big firms and rich individuals start rapidly flowing in. Btc isn't even ready for the masses yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:57:53
yeah that was uncomfortable to watch

If nobody ever figures this out, is bitcoin going to die or have to be changed in a significant, fundamental way?
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:28:55
You're only thinking about the old generation of the first world population. Bitcoin opens the door to billions of other people to be involved in the global economy and share a common currency. This is unprecedented and could pour a vast amount of value into BTC over the next decade or so. It will be interesting to see what happens.

There are many value propositions for bitcoin. It is a truly remarkable new technology. More and more people and institutions are beginning to realize this. More and more people want a piece of the pie. Price has to go up to meet demand.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:06:02
While that truly would be incredible, don't underestimate how many people there are on this planet and how few bitcoins there are. If everyone starts wanting a piece, the price has to go up dramatically.

I'm extremely disappointed in Bill Gates for not only spreading the most generic BS FUD that a 10pm nightly news anchor would regurgitate from the teleprompter, but he doesn't even acknowledge any of the groundbreaking technological achievements that have been made in this space.

For dummy's what?
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:45:33
It's not supposed to replace fiat in its current state. It'll take decades for that to happen, if ever, and the price would need to be significantly higher and used in such a way that major fluctuations in price percentage-wise don't occur often. Bitcoin does offer some utility right now (quick, borderless, immutable, peer-to-peer payements,) but it's not correct to think you can simply hold it for more than a few days at times before it's worth something totally different.
You can use it quickly to transact, and it's quite valuable in this sense. You can speculate and hold it, and it has historically appreciated in value due to its increasing demand and fixed supply. 
Governments literally can't take bitcoin away from you, unlike most everything else in this world, which should come in very handy in the coming decades too. 
There is a lot of value crypto will bring to this world. The market will find its price.

I was in the red for years. It hurt, but I stuck to my plan and I am currently in the green. My mantra has evolved into "bitcoin goes up, bitcoin goes down, but mostly up." In a longer time frame, you are likely to be in the green again. If you can't stomach not having 9k for longer than a couple of weeks, you shouldn't have bought in the first place.

@_date: 2018-02-28 05:01:06
There seem to be several factors you aren't considering in the value of bitcoin. First of all, bitcoin is a decentralized trust system, and money is just one application. Second, I'm assuming you live in a first world country with easy access to banking and credit. There are literally billions of people on this planet who don't have access to these luxuries, however, they *might* have an internet connection. That's all they need to participate in the bitcoin economy. Not a single person could confiscate their bitcoin given proper security measures or change the rules of the protocol on them. These are very important things for a lot of people, and they now have a chance to build up savings.
Yes, this is still very much just an experiment, but it's not hard to read the writing on the wall. This technology is a game-changer for global finance. It will weed out a lot of corruption and add tons more transparency. It will bring billions of new people to a global economy and it will create and capture value that was not able to be captured before. 
It will be a revolution, and a very interesting one. Sure, bitcoin may not appeal to you in the same way as many others. It won't inherently provide insurance for you if you lose your keys. It won't inherently give you sky miles for using it. What it will do for you is *always* be there, chugging along, not giving a fuck. It's a rock. It works every time and you don't need to ask and trust a stranger or unelected officials to balance the books for you. That's valuable to many people. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:33:55


By "this space" I assume you mean cryptocurrencies. The value proposition this new technology holds is quite staggering. The increasing market cap is just getting warmed up. If bitcoin manages to seriously shit the bed, the next best thing will pick up right where it left off. Fizzling out is no longer realistic in "this space." 
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:54:26
 I hadn't used electrum before, and I didn't think to look at the fee breakdown. The sweep had maybe 10-15 inputs and it was set to "dynamic" for fees I guess. IDK, kind of bullshit I think. Still wondering if it was my bad or kind of scammy. Ugh

i wouldn't only correlate what is happening in the news right now with price action. keep in mind all of the positives for bitcoin in the last few years with no accompanying price rise (all of the 3 year bear market.) The last halving last summer may be playing a much bigger role now than it did a year ago. Just some thoughts. I appreciate all of this caution though as I am still quite surprised and a little nervous about this price explosion.
