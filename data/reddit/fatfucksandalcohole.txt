More likely to crash before New Years than the opposite simply based on tax-selling and holidays.

I absolutely love that the alt-right muppets think that this man is 'masterminding' things. Dude, Soros can't 'mastermind' his pants on, how he gonna run some fucking 7th state Dr. Evil organization?

Idiot opinion obviously, but good for you that you don't care.

We interviewed zero miners, and came to the conclusion that they don't care if they make money or not. What retarded hamster whore this toiler paper?

And if ducks were 400LB had wheels we could ride them to work.

I like how you are pretending that a trend line exists that just cuts right through an earlier pump and doesn't even touch on a support. And conveniently leaving out volume. Autistic duck.

Why wouldn't they? A $50 million loss due to a hack offsets an equal amount of tax burden in many scenarios.

Quality that one expects.

Decentralization has nothing to do with manipulation. There isn't even a vague correlation.

1. You are wrong. 2. How is that relevant?

No shit. You can zoom out any damn asset to a point where it looks sexy, that doesn't mean you aren't broke.

Nah, tobacco, booze and gambling is fine. Also known as, recession here we go!

Centralized or decentralized doesn't matter. Anything can  , is, and will be manipulated.

Not quite how leverage works.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:09:42
Bitmex, as much of a total scam as it is, doesn't own the leverage. They collect a fee, but there is a counterpart to the trade that hold short positions. It's sort of crazy illegal for an exchange to own leverage risk.
