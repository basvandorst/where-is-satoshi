What those people say is not a solid truth, rather solid hypotheses. Bitcoin should not be a thing of cult, rather factual information. Almost nobody understands it’s implications and why it has inherent value. People just assume things because others tell them. The narrative where there are zero negatives to bitcoin is bad and will make a lot of people lose their investments as soon as bitcoin has a big retracement, because they don’t understand it enough to sit trough the bleeding numbers. Bitcoin is heavely manipulated and if people are not aware of this they will buy in at the top and sell at the bottom.
Calling people dumb over the internet is not being an asshole. It’s an assumption based on what people on the internet post within a comment. Being labeled dumb is relative to the person stating the presumed fact. Go google what an assumption is and research the generic comments on everything crypto related post, thread, video etc.

If the information you’re referencing is understood by even dumb people like yourself. This would make it all common knowledge and bitcoin would already be at or rising harder towards those prices. It’s not and will keep swinging accordingly to market sentiment and economical influences.
Bitcoin is no money, rather a speculative store of value. Many factors will affect it’s price. At the moment it’s mostly manipulation. You can’t be 100% certain bitcoin wil 10x or 100x again. The upcoming recession could either make bitcoin rise immensely or drop it’s value to under mining rewards.
