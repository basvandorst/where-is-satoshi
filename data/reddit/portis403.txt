Interesting, I'll take that into consideration :). Are you referencing the color coordination? B/c other than that, they are quite the same
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:25:07
Sure, that's a reasonable request :) I've marked it down for the end of the year
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:14:15
I apologize for the errant summary, it was not my intent. It was based off what I assumed to be a reputable source, but after further research I was mistaken.

You are right and this was my mistake. I have edited the text within the image itself to reflect this.
My apologies, spreading negative information was not my intent.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:13:00
You're right. I have clarified this in the new summary.
This was completely my mistake and it was based off an article from a respected source. After looking into it further, I was wrong.
I'm sorry. Spreading not 100% accurate information was not my intention.

Hey Everyone,
**We have finally launched our new site! Please come check it out over at [Futurism.co/Tour](
The new site provides daily summaries and an email digest of the top future future-tech stories, as well as the ability to vote on your favorites to be included in this weekly image that is shared to Reddit! If you submit a story and we use it, we will include your name on the image :).
I'd love to hear any and all feedback that everyone has. Again, thank you for enjoying these images!
We are also experimenting with linking to a page on our site as opposed to a jpeg. If you have an issue with this, please let me know.

Thanks for the comment! Hmm everything I've read says $12M in Bitcoin. Could you point me towards the source you're looking at?
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:09:38
They don't currently accept Bitcoin. I suppose I should have clarified that minor detail. I'm sorry.
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:33:43
You're absolutely right :). I have edited the submission. Thanks so much for pointing this out!
@_date: 2015-03-07 19:25:37
Thanks, appreciate it! Yup, I create them every week :)

I'm not really sure why I keep getting down-voted for providing the sources here.

Thanks! They don't seem to get remotely as much traction as either the science or tech images, but I'm hoping that as the community continues to grow they may pick up a bit :)

Thanks so much, I really appreciate it :)
