So, rice for .0001 BTC = US $1.15 at current value. That is not so different than what rice costs in the US. It seems very expensive given what is going on in Venezuela. Is $1 for rice a correct value?

It could theoretically be profitable. If your phone is the only device in the world that is mining Bitcoin, eventually you will solve a block. That block might not be profitable. The next several might not be profitable. At some point, the difficulty will be radically deceased so that a block can be mined every 10 minutes. After that, your phone will solve a block every 10 minutes and you will get the full reward every 10 minutes. 
You will be extremely profitable after that. Bitcoin was made to adjust to a wide variety of circumstances.

I think that $1m is a more likely stable price point than $1k, if a stable price point is ever reached. If demand for the coin goes up, the price must go up also.
It's certainly not guaranteed to go that high, and I have no timeline for when it could happen.

So, what you are saying is the best case for this Ponzi scheme is to level off at $1,000? That would be the best for mass adoption of a ponzi scheme?

Had to read the title a few times before I decided this is a brief video about Bitcoin, and not a video about shorting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-15 06:57:43
That's not likely. If the masses want to get into BTC, they are going to have to buy some. As the masses buy BTC, the price will go up due to the scarcity. Mass adoption basically has to come with higher prices for BTC. The people who hold btc now are still the early adopters.

What can you purchase directly with BTC? How much BTC for rice or bread or cooking oil?
Or do you convert the BTC to bolivares to buy things?

I understand the low fees and fast transactions that bch offers. I think bch could serve a purpose. It really doesn't today because there's not enough places that take it to be meaningful. If that happens someday, maybe I will keep a nominal amount in bch to buy coffee or whatever. I like BTC because it has stood the test of time, coming through several different issues and it's still going strong. It is the most known and the coin that has the most exchanges, wallets, media coverage, and is basically the coin all others are priced against. These factors by far outweigh the idea that it is not the closest ideologically to the Nakamura white paper for me.

Great post. Clear and rational. Thank you for taking the time to state the facts plainly.

Is there conclusive proof that all those tethers are being used exclusively for BTC? Could they be spread around to other coins?
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:41:59
The possibility of gains is making massive amounts of people aware of crypto. We need the masses to come to make the BTC economy grow.

He's no journalist. This is a pure clickbait  ploy, and an opinion piece. He's saying if it crashes, you're screwed. And if it moons, you're screwed! Lol
If you search his name on this subreddit, you'll see he cranks out a hot take like this every so often. What a tool.

How much capital would a corporation need to sink into BTC to have enough impact to drive the price down later when they sell? Is that how they would manipulate the price to make money on the shorts on the future market?

When you buy from coinbase via a bank account, you will be waiting for about a week until you get your Bitcoin. It has nothing to do with the blockchain. Coinbase does this to ensure the bank transfer is legit and cannot be reversed.

It means if you own 21 bitcoins you own one millionth of all the bitcoins that will ever exist.

Uhm, just wanted to underscore your point in a different way. Sorry if it annoyed you.

So, sending BTC from gdax to ledger wallet is cheaper than coinbase to ledger because of fees? I guess I don't understand why the mining fee would be any different... Does coinbase charge a premium?

My relief that I woke up to a $15k price is much greater than my regret that I did not buy the dip.

Couldn't he just go from the coinbase wallet to the ledger? Why transfer to gdax wallet?

There is an Amazon-only token today.  You can exchange Fiat for it and transmit it to others electronically in moments. You can purchase millions of items with it! It's called a gift card.

Put some dummy words in your phrase that only you know are fake. Use words that will be obvious to only you that they don't belong. 
Maybe also cut the list in half and hide the halves in two separate locations. It's useless without both halves and you need to know which words to omit on top of that.

If the coins are in your coinbase account, just log into gdax using your coinbase account. Then you transfer your coinbase coins into your gdax account. Then you can transfer into your wallet without fees.

I have head this a few times and really don't know much about futures trading. Is this right... For every short contact there is a long contract to balance it out and the exchange just profits off the fees? It's all done in pairs, right? 
If this is correct, then there had to be a significant entity who wants the price to go up for every big bear who shorts. To me, this mutes the pure downward pressure a short future contact presents.

It was not a life changing amount of money, a nice stack for sure but that is it. You have two things to carry away from this... One - it is not too late to buy into crypto and benefit from the growth. Get back into the game, even in a small way. Two - use this and resolve to learn from your experience. I don't think that selling the coins was such a bad thing. The thing that really hurts was that you had a specific plan and you let yourself slide away from the plan.  Make a realistic plan and execute on the plan and then do not deviate. You may or may not be successful, but at least you will know you made your best effort and did not sell yourself short. Win lose or draw, that will be easier to live with.

If you are hodling, the fees are inconsequential compared to the long term gains and the security that the uncompromised ledger wallet provides.

This is exactly why casinos give you chips to gamble and don't typically allow cash bets. It's much easier to bet .5 BTC than it is to lay down a $4,600 bet, even though the two are roughly equal.
Would you ever make a $4,600 cash bet?

My post says that the guy who started this comment thread is asking you to try to make future analysis and to post it publicly. 
I make no comment about what you have done in the past or any critical statement about you whatsoever.
I really honestly don't get how your see me as a troll.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:58:46
Let's say you put a small summary of your risk assessments in this sub once a week for the next 12 weeks, not the full version that your subscribers get, but a summary. 
If your posts then show a strong correlation with the BTC market it would be a feather in your cap.
It could be a great investment for you to give out a bit of your analysis in order to possibly gain customers. If that suggestion is nonsensical or makes me a troll, so be it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:45:26
I say, how many chances in your life will you get to take advantage of an investment before the institutional money has taken all the big profits? If you use just a fraction of what you have saved up, you can possibly make an appreciable gain in your retirement.

When you say "what your say has no basis in fact" makes me think that you do not understand what I wrote. I am not making any statements about you or your data. 
I'm not sure why you think I am trolling you.

Do the research and create a slide deck spelling out the risks, the past performance, and upside potential for Bitcoin and cryptos.
Tell them you would like to use a portion of your money to invest and that you would need their help to set up accounts. 
Maybe they will join in as well. I think this turns out better for you if they are informed and give consent. If my kids did this, i would give it a shot just to reward then for doing the work and having the drive to grow.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:47:00
This person is giving you a challenge. He wants you to publicly post what your analysis of your data indicates for 16 weeks. If the price of BTC follows your analysis for 12 out of 16 weeks, then it will be very impressive for you and will give you credibility. 
Perhaps you will gain subscribers if your analysis is confirmed in this way. Of course, you risk being wrong.
He was not questioning any claims you may or may not have made in the past. I think there is no need for hostility towards this person.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:38:47
I am making zero claims.

Imagine you went all in Nov 2017, and bought in at 11,000 with all your cash and hodled. You didn't sell at the top and have been underwater for the past year and a half. Would you have been financially ok? Emotionally ok?
You have to look at this in the real world.
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:52:24
Some people will be on the fence already, and this will be the tipping point for them. Some people are pretty tech savvy and might jump in right away.
But I think about going to an exchange, creating an account, getting verified by them, transferring cash to the exchange, creating the buy order, perhaps setting up a wallet... It's just a lot for a newbie to get through quickly. 
Maybe it's just my own need for a working knowledge of these particulars before I jump into something with my cash...
@_date: 2019-05-19 18:09:07
Think about when you first bought Bitcoin. For the great majority of people, the learning curve to going from zero knowledge to owning Bitcoin is steep.  If you are a newbie, even if you fall in love with Bitcoin after the show, there are still so many hoops to jump through before you can buy.
Maybe we get a bump, but it's going to be largely people who already are owners just accumulating more. The newbies will come along in the next couple of months, especially if we see some additional gains. First they become aware, and then the fomo hits. Jmho
@_date: 2019-05-07 00:51:33
Bitcoin fomo frenzy could be very interesting. Obscuring nodes is currently happening, is that right?
@_date: 2019-05-20 01:44:07
Try buying something for gold. You basically can't. You can buy all sorts of things with Bitcoin. It is happening every day all around the world. It is much more than just digital gold.
With that said, it's still much easier to do most transactions with cash/credit. That may not always be the case, but it's true today.
@_date: 2019-05-07 00:39:16
Thanks for the detailed and balanced response. I definitely think that it would take Draconian measures on a global scale to affect the network, which is admittedly unlikely. Even then, the effectiveness is far from sure.
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:12:39
As we progress far into the future, I think it is likely that really powerful computers will be able to hack into old wallets and steal/recover lost Bitcoin. People actively using crypto will have moved on to stronger protection.
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:47:18
I'm not talking about bitcoins being illegal, just running nodes. 
And just for clarity, this is just for discussion.
