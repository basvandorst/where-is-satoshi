so after some suggestions are accepted, people downloaded a new version which is modified by some programmers?

Thanks for answering. I'll study about what you said.

1. someone modifies the code and suggests it to people
2. more than 50% of people agreed
3. people downloaded a modified version
this is how bitcoin updated?

I understand a second reason but still not understand clearly about a first reason.
I'm taking a lecture about blockchain in udemy.
And the teacher in the lecture said block size is still 1 megabyte after the segwit update.
1. a block size is still 1 megabyte now?
if a block size is 1 mega, I don't understand why a segwit update makes a block look bigger.
As I read the comments, transactions and signatures are still in one block but segregated.(is it right?)
 It means transactions + signatures + some info(nonce, previous hash, merkleroot ..etc) = 1 mega
2. how it exactly makes a block look bigger?? 
3. the picture below is a appropriate picture after a segwit update? 
block headers(nonce, previous hash... etc)
signatures1||         transactions1
signatures2||         transactions2
signatures3||         transactions3
....                 ||        .....

I've finally understood there's no block size anymore but block weight by googling and reading many comments.
but I don't understand your comment clearly about serialization. can you explain more simply?
what do you mean   "but witnessdata1 is inside transaction1 " ?
Doesn't segwit update separate witness(information about signature, sender, receiver ..) from transactions?

Thanks for answering can i ask a question more? 
Is target hash created in previous block?   
For example, if there are three blocks A-B-C  (A is the oldest block) and people are trying to mine block D,
block C has a target hash for block D? because something has to inform a target hash to miners but block D is not created yet.

oh i know the difficulty is recalculated every 2016 blocks but the target hash is not created every block??

what does bs mean?

I almost understand how the block is calculated. and here's my last question.
As far as i know, 1MB(it can be more larger after segwit update) limit is for whole block.
but your comment looks like only transactions have 1MB limit.
you drop the block header(Nonce, merkle root,previous hash... etc) because it occupies a very little space or 
only transactions get 1MB limit???

a bitcoin foundation is founded by Satoshi?
if not, how can they access to a original bitcoin code??
