That is an absolute bullshit response from Bitgo. What if someone never saved that recovery key because they use something like lastpass? We were never told we would need to save the recovery key in case of a lapse of security between bitgo and bitfinex... I am having the frozen bitgo account issue, and now bitgo and bitfinex are both telling me to contact each other about the problem while my money remains frozen.

I really hope this means bitstamp can get some liquidity in their books at some point soon. It's kind of annoying to see a single 25btc order every $150-$175, with a gap full of dust-sized orders in between.

Coinbase is just as bad as paypal. Take your business elsewhere. I will NEVER use them again due to ridiculous problems they caused me as well.

My account name and email address are not on the list they posted, and I made my account in 2013. Could this be an old list they posted?

Actually after double-checking my registration email, it was May 22nd, 2013 that I registered.
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:47:33
I agree with you. I made my account on May 22nd, 2013 .. and my username and email isn't on that list.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:57:43
Yes it is, because i want money.

Just took a look at the tutorial and it seems like everything is being done right. I'm not seeing anything that's wrong. Here's a screenshot of what it looks like when i try to run it in the editor too. I do have a cell named USDperBTC in my spreadsheet. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 10:25:45
I tried this, but when i try to run the code, I get an error message that says:
error: Argument must be a range (line 7, file "Code")
Any suggestions? Thanks for this! I hope to get it working.
@_date: 2014-10-27 02:47:38
2 weeks seriously? When you ordered did it still say it was a preorder, or did it say it was available?
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:32:40
Why do idiots create useless posts on reddit?
@_date: 2014-02-23 05:04:26
Mind if I share my spreadsheet with you so you can take a look? You can PM me your google account and I can give you access :D 
@_date: 2014-02-23 04:58:03
Yup. I do have a cell that's named USDperBTC

I can't stand it when people run contests in seemingly unethical ways like that. They shouldn't have responded to you like that and at least made some sort of attempt to fix their mistake. I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out that the whole thing was rigged just to build up advertising revenue.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:26:29
I do not feel sorry for anyone who risks their "life savings" then loses it all. Good luck with your begging.
@_date: 2014-02-23 01:21:33
Would you mind helping me fix this? Sorry to bug. But I really want my spreadhseet to give me accurate coinbase sell prices including fees and still can't find a way that works well :(

Excellent. Now I can load up on Viagra anonymously to prepare for the next time btc hits 1250.

Just checked my registration email. May 22 is when I registered and I am not on the list.
@_date: 2014-02-01 08:00:26
Can we create multiple receiving addresses using this wallet? I can't find a way to do it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:16:36
@_date: 2014-02-23 05:16:43
So what is this picture supposed to prove? Do you expect wildly different prices at all the exchanges?
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:41:42
Tired of people posting this suicide bullshit. If you don't have the balls to trade, then don't do it. And if you hold such little value to your life that you'd be willing to end it all over some bitcoins, then you should have just killed yourself a long time ago and quit wasting time.
@_date: 2017-01-09 13:11:46
Thanks for reminding me to leave them a 1 star review for rendering themselves totally useless.
@_date: 2018-03-04 14:07:11
It's still broken after a month. Maybe they gave up on the site?
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:14:42
That's an old way of thinking though. You don't need to sell all your bitcoin to have spending power. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 02:26:20
Purse no longer allows products buyers to add gift cards to their wish lists. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:33:34
It's done with what?
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:48:05
Im mostly just buying and holding onto it. But i'm also attempting to use it as my main currency as much as possible to support merchants who accept it. I'm buying amazon gift cards on gyft.com for when I need to buy something on amazon. I've also bought gift cards and a few other things on coingig.com. 
When i spend my bitcoins in this way, I also make sure to replace that amount in my bitcoin wallet. For example, if i spend $100 worth of bitcoins on a gift card, i'll buy $100 worth of bitcoins on coinbase. I don't really care about short term fluctuations, so whether it's $500 or $800 per btc when I spend my bitcoins, i don't really care since i know i'll be holding bitcoins for the long term. 
Since you said you'll be using a wallet on your computer, MAKE SURE your computer is secure, and that you open your wallet settings and encrypt it. You should also back up your wallet regularly, and store it somewhere off your computer, like google drive or dropbox. You may even want to back it up on a USB stick as well.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:14:59
At this point in time, it does not make sense for Amazon to accept Bitcoin. I'm not saying they shouldn't accept it eventually, but right now, bitcoin is way too volatile for amazon to risk accepting it with their razor-thin profit margins. I'm sure theyre watching it, and when things stabilize and Bitcoin gains even wider acceptance, Amazon will jump onboard.
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:46:32
Your password length and complexity is irrelevant if your computer is infected with something. 
Format your computer, install some antivirus/antispyware, use firefox or chrome (not IE), enable 2FA [(Two-Factor Authenticaction)]( with your mobile phone, and make sure you never enter your password after you've followed links in an email. You can get phished like that.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:45:17
Amazon would need bitcoin to be MUCH more stable to even consider it. Amazon's profit margins are already razor thin as it is. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:11:11
It doesn't say this on the site, but it ONLY works with VISA cards. My friend had the same problem a few days ago and contacted support about it.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:02:30
What exactly is the process of creating a paper wallet once i've bought bitcoins on bitstamp?
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:32:20
Yup that is true. But as long as you're using a clean computer and you keep your wallet encrypted with a strong password (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols), the chance of theft is pretty much impossible.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:40:17
Apple booted the coinbase app off the appstore :( 
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:31:35
Obviously nobody should install this EXE file. You will probaly get your coins or passwords stolen if you do.
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:41:03
At this point in time, bugging amazon customer service to accept bitcoin is stupid. I'm not saying they shouldn't accept it eventually, but right now, bitcoin is way too volatile for amazon to risk accepting it with their razor-thin profit margins. Let's quit wasting time bugging their customer service for now, and take a look at this idea again in 1-2 years.  
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:53:03
Can you say how much it was please?
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:44:12
It's crashing because it was at $650 two hours ago, and now it's at $800 again? Oh ok, I get it!
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:38:09
They didn't lose anything unless they panic sold. And if they did panic sell and it was their life savings, then they are stupid, and they should appreciate the lesson they just learned about risking their life savings on volatile investments.

I withdrew some BTC at 1:17AM PST and got the confirmation email about 10 seconds later. Clicked the confirmation link, and now i'm waiting. No unconfirmed transactions in my wallet yet, and it's been 20 minutes. It's never taken this long before. Getting worried..
*Edit: 2:02AM - Just saw the transaction pop up in my wallet (after 45 minutes), and it now has 2 confirmations. Thank the lord aliens almighty. My heart was pounding in my neck for nearly an hour... I think i'm gonna relax and hold onto my BTC for a little while...
@_date: 2013-12-20 08:26:34
Watch out for people on Coingig that sell very cheap gift cards. They are using stolen credit cards to buy the gift cards, and the gift cards will stop working. I got ripped off this way on coingig for a $300 whole foods gift card. I was only able to spend about $70 on the card before it got voided.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:04:23
I use coinbase as my active wallet, but i don't store much in there. The rest I keep securely backed up in another wallet.

Amazing compilation. Sharing it with friends who are still on the fence. Thanks!

Are you trying to withdraw to USD? Don't bother trying to withdraw USD from gox. It will take MONTHS to get it. Make a coinbase account, send your bitcoins to coinbase, then you can withdraw them from there.
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:04:23
Good idea. Just voted it up and left a comment there.

For everyday purchases, use the blockchain app. For light trading, you can just use the mtgox website. They have a mobile interface that works fine. Don't try to use it to day trade all day long though :P 
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:03:53
Confirmations do, but unconfirmed transactions usually show up in about a minute. All my withdrawals in the past showed up as an unconfirmed transaction in my wallet literally within 2-3 minutes. Taking 45 minutes just for the unconfirmed transaction to show up felt weird to me.

They had a huge table full of free cookies, and some delicious organic tea of all different flavors. Also free coffee.

Instantly huh :( 
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:00:15
Thanks for the reminder, I just downloaded it in case apple removes it later too. I guess i'll just have to send some btc to a blockchain wallet if i want to make local purchases using bitcoin later.

Was that an email they sent you? wtf 393 hours??
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:18:23
It was a really bad idea to buy coins when that message popped up. All i did was refresh the site once in a while till that message didn't show anymore, then bought more coins at the current price instead of having to wait.
