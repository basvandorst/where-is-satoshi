Yeah let's ignore the Korean finance minister in January this year. 
Just claiming to be banning crypto in Korea made the markets tank.
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:13:30
UK banks are very different to that analogy.
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:36:21
No they're not, plenty of coins offer things btc can't... And unlike bitcoin, some have a roadmap/vision.
@_date: 2018-06-06 06:04:41
Lol, are you serious? I hope not.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:56:06
Bcash is the reason I sold btc and don't/won't hold either. The constant attacks towards eachother are painful to watch, I'd rather be part of a friendlier community. This sub spend far too much time complaining about bcash, whilst they seem to just get on with it.
Still rooting for btc, just from the sidelines now.
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:04:44
On a serious note...putting our arguments aside...i saw a post today that you should really take a read of and let me know your thoughts. 
Just read the 2 long posts. 
I'm curious to know what your thoughts are of it, whether you think it's something to concern or not. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:17:24
Name something btc does that an alt coin doesn't?
@_date: 2018-06-05 23:05:24
It'll never get mass adoption if it needs the electricity supply of Denmark and or more.
The world is going green, you don't need the most secure POW that consumes a country's worth of power, you just need one that works.

Thing is...you're pretending that Corruption isn't a problem in South Korea. 
As someone that spends half his life in South Korea....I can safely tell you that corruption is a huge problem over there and you can be sure as hell that many, what America would call illegal activities, are happening on a daily basis over there. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:25:18
Been around since 2012, sold most my btc last year as I saw how broken it was. Far better potential or there in the long run. I think we'll see next year being the end of btc's rule. I might be wrong, but as it stands...btc does nothing special. Also LN has been promised for 4 years... And is still years away, by the time it's implemented people will have moved on. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 07:59:51
No... No it doesn't.
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:05:04
What ban? They never banned Crypto. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:17:52
Maybe they should investigate the fact that binance, Bithumb and coinone servers are in the same building, allowing for insider arbitrage trading milliseconds before the rest of us, yet those milliseconds can be millions in profit when done correctly.
Just a thought.
Edit: if you're a journo, get in touch with me, I'm happy to elaborate and provide a lot more info for a good story.
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:44:02
Well I'm glad we can agree to disagree. Competition is good and the markets will decide.
@_date: 2018-06-12 08:30:49
I'm pro KYC, this isn't a scam, it's the business ensuring they're staying compliant.
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:05:18
To call all alt coins a scammy business is just wrong. Let's not pretend btc doesn't have shortfalls. 
Unless btc can sort out it's insatiable appetite for electricity, it won't stay at the top. Also, just because a business is at the head of an alt coin, doesn't mean they control their blockchain. 
I don't know why I bother replying, I'm most likely Shadow banned from here for being subscribed to @_date: 2018-06-11 22:10:08
Non of those make it unique, you know that right? Some of them are even debatable too. I mean, you could argue bitcoin cash is just as good... Yet it has a figure head... Whether you like him or not.
@_date: 2018-06-15 21:25:07
''decentralised'' is such an overused word these days. I don't think we'll ever had a decentralised exchange...certainly not in the next 10.
Atomic swaps et al are interesting, but having servers literally connected to each other gives insider traders a huge advantage.  
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:25:04
you weren't here for the crash of '13 were you? 
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:34:04
Lol, is that all you have. You don't know much about some the alts of there do you?
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:16:09
there's a huge difference between basically banned and not banned..which is what you're saying.
Anyone that was following it knew pretty much the same day that the Justice minister fucked up. 
i will, however agree that it was the start of downward trend. Which, let's be honest...was due ages ago. 
I'll stand by my words and say this could take 4 years to get back to December/January levels. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:37:59
Is there actually any proof to that? plenty of other coins have named to spread around the world.
If institutional money is entering the realm, then surely btc is getting bought up, decreasing their spread more than others.
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:58:19
Bitcoin doesn't hold a monopoly on decentralization. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 09:10:35
Lol. Ok mate. 
Like I said, regardless of how important it is. It's not going to win the public opinion when they read articles about how much electricity it uses. 
Btc is Gen 1. It's expensive, slow and requires a lot of electricity
I'm guess you're unaware of the competition. 
Anyway, going to stop here, your condescending tone really shows the person you are.
@_date: 2018-06-06 07:19:20
And what's that? There's nothing btc does that some alts are doing.
@_date: 2018-06-06 07:51:08
Or the markets will choose to go for coins that don't get so power hungry. 
I can see that happening way before the idea that btc will be used to heat homes, lol.
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:52:53
no they didn't. The justice minister went rogue and the pm, immediately made a public statement that they weren't banning crypto. 
I go to Korea a lot, seriously...Korea never banned crypto.
Unless you're mistaking crypto for ICOs....then that's very different...but I'm sure you wouldn't make such a simple mistake, would you? 
@_date: 2018-11-08 10:10:33
Uses a lot of electricity and controlled by a few big companies mining it.
Will the public really get behind it?
@_date: 2018-11-08 10:58:09
You would've if you were around in December. Took fucking hours to move BTC.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:46:15
Anyone else here regularly use purse.io? I'm on there every week spending BTC. 20% off on anything on Amazon...why would you not?
@_date: 2018-07-10 11:10:01
Lol, did you even try and use it 7 months ago?...btc is Gen 1, slow and expensive when it's under pressure. It's the MySpace of the crypto world.
@_date: 2018-07-05 19:14:36
Ummmm, yes it can and it's happened already, see the other guy's comment
@_date: 2018-07-25 07:21:57
You never refuted my statement either, instead you just commented about the account age. Kind of makes me think you have no argument.
@_date: 2018-07-22 18:29:38
so how do i buy some Bolivars? 
@_date: 2018-07-02 13:33:09
Terrible analogy but thanks for trying. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 19:15:45
Yeah they're thinking how they can charge the kind of fees people were willing to pay back in December.
@_date: 2018-07-06 20:55:57
So point one is the only unique advantage it has over many other crypto currencies....
that's like saying Myspace is best because it came first.
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:08:33
No I think you're the one struggling. This isn't Facebook, people have multiple accounts and renew them frequently.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:10:09
Plenty are better than btc. Look at how close Eth is and yet it's much younger. BTC just has the age advantage....it doesn't have a tech advantage.
@_date: 2018-07-09 15:01:39
wasn't it a store of value 7 months ago? 
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:15:00
plenty happening as we speak.
Damn, Quark doing well as well....I used to have thousands of those back in 2013...I bought them at $0.20....that was not one of my smartest moves. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 11:47:24
I did and made a lot more money than btc would've made me. 
There's space for more than just btc...especially since btc doesn't have anything special about it anymore. It's got first mover advantage...whoopty doo
@_date: 2018-07-02 12:43:29
Lol...tell me what btc does that is special? 
Don't mention LN.
It's slow, power hungry and expensive in high traffic.
Early bird advantage...that's all.
Call alts shitcoins all you like...many are better than btc. Btc is Gen 1...crypto has improved since its creation.
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:10:48
Solid reply, thanks for the effort.
@_date: 2018-07-07 18:19:32
Put together a new computer last month using purse.io. spent about $5000 of btc for it. Bought my wife a new car 2 months ago using my btc profits too.
It's not all about holding...it's ok to spend some.
Big fan of purse.io though....it's just hard to look at purchase history....knowing I spent a few btc on a new phone a few years ago is tough lol.
@_date: 2018-04-30 04:09:34
Ummmm....what? 
They kind of do.
I agree something needs to change though... It's what is pushing people away from btc to be honest.
@_date: 2018-07-09 15:12:53
Well..I'd say crypto is...whether Bitcoin will is another discussion.
Myspace was too big to fail back in the day...I think current crypto is paving the way but think most if not all of what we know today, wont be around in 10 years.
