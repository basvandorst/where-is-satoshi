This.  Of course bitcoin needs to succeed for alts to succeed.  Sure there are a ton of scam coins, but there are real coins out there that are attempting to serve a specific purpose, community, niche, or add features.  There's no reason Bitcoin and Altcoins can't coexist, they actually strengthen each other in my opinion.

Pretty sure he means another SHA-256 coin in which case he's correct.

Eh, this doesn't really work imo. I'm extremely bullish on BTC but that doesn't change the fact that if you look from the highest peak to know the price has been steadily dropping.  How low do we go til a full reversal?

No source.  
  Oh well, I'm sure word of mouth about a guy named Darkwings is good enough.  SELL SELL SELL

I'm just writing this here so maybe someone will see it, since a lot of other countries are seeming to use XBT for bitcoin in exchanges, I haven't seen it in the US as much and don't think it's as common as BTC, but why not suggest officially XBT = 1 bit (100 Sat) and BTC = 1 bitcoin
  That way it isn't really changing anything 'just bought a few bits', 'just bought some bitcoin'  100,000 XBT would be   .1 Bitcoin, that works a lot better in the real world in my opinion

Also wondering.. It can't be just gox right? that's been going on for a while, is it just related to the more (very) recent price drops on gox? what's the deal?

Step 1:  Withdraw USD from bank account.  
  Step 2:  Throw directly into toilet.  
Step 3: Flush.
Congratulations, you have just purchased bitcoin on MT.GOX!
  In all seriousness I sure hope you don't seriously plan on buying on Gox. And if you really want to there are a number of places all around the internet where your question has already been answered.
