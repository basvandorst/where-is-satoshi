I personally think the alpha mentality goes back to our more primitive brain and that it would be a huge evolutionary step for us to break free of it entirely. In this case the alpha types who feel they are at a higher evolutionary stage are more likely causing our evolution as a species to stagnate.

What I see is a new opportunity for a decentralized exchange that can deposit funds from a bank account without the bank knowing its an exchange. That's my only concern with this new IRS ruling.

I completely agree with that article and I'm in bitcoin for all those reasons. My friend however is an investor and he sees things from that point of view. Charts, trends and indicators. He's also 10 years older than me. So when he asks me what the  risk reward ratio is it's because he wants to value bitcoin as a stock. I have explained to him that it's not really like that but he simply will not trust it unless he can have it in numbers. I feel there are alot of investors like him that would invest in bitcoin if they could value it thus my inquiry. Bridge the gap if possible.

If your phone is how you do 2fa I'm guessing that will be the next ave of attack. Prolly mitm attacks on phone data or the like since phone apps bypass the 2fa and only require a one time PW.

I refuse to pay any nation taxes on bitcoin transactions. This would surely end Coinbase or any other wallet that tracks your purchases. No third parties allowed in the bitcoin market IMO. This is one of those moments where bitcoin and all crypto needs to stand it's ground and not comply. Besides you can always just use your own wallet and only shop at places that ensure they do not tax bitcoin transactions. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 12:47:53
I am disappointed too because I was under the impression that bitcoin was supposed to be outside of government and bank control. I can understand taxation when converting back into USD or any nations currency but taxation on mining and wallet to wallet purchases...I'm not reporting that. The IRS has no right to tax bitcoin in the bitcoin network or to decide how we use it. IMO its a currency and that's how I'm gonna use it...and as long as others still use it as a currency then by vote of confidence its a currency.

Dealing with Coinbase or any other exchange that reports your info would be easy. Just make your own cold wallet and done. Real issue here is how banks will handle btc purchases.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:57:25
I think I see the root of your issue which is more customer service based. Many people have made purchases with btc at multiple price levels in dollars. The issue your describing is more from a perspective that values btc in dollars as if someone spending btc is entitled to the dollar value of what ever they purchase. If you want to treat btc as a currency then just like other currencies their value as compared to dollars fluctuates. In fact the forex market is the most volatile of all markets. So your concern is that people will flood your customer service complaints line or stop shopping with you because your not willing to make up the exchange difference. The problem with this perspective is that these metrics are based on average people who don't even know what btc is our how to use it. I work for Lowes home improvement and I would love to see us accept btc. I've been telling store managers and csa's about it for a year and they think I'm nuts. People in big box retail stores dont know about btc. So if this "major retailer" happens to be Lowes you should make store 1200 of Robinson, PA a test store so I can see the look of surprise on that store managers face.

@_date: 2014-02-21 14:10:03
Gox is not bitcoin. Its the remains of an exchange. If we were to somehow bring gox back it would require taking goxs btc holdings and paying back every customer in btc so they could break even. Then start over from scratch... But the people running this exchange are not going to do that. They are going to screw their customers and leave with all their holdings. Your best bet is to find a way to force gox to do what they will not do themselves.

The whole thing feels like a psyop to me especially after watching the great hack on Netflix. It's like they're trying to persuade the audience to not trust decentralization. They even mention that he worked on a centralized cryptocurrency project and that he is the son of a banker. The underlying message that you can't trust yourself in a trustless system because even Satoshi the creator of bitcoin couldn't manage his wealth. I'm very curious to see what this clean slate agenda will be. I'm guessing something along the lines of giving up some decentralization in favor of some security so you never have to suffer the same fate as poor Satoshi.

It's for this reason that I think the developers if bitcoin should contact the developer for SSD as he has developed a way for his sha-256 coin to use stenography.

And if you don't love me now,
You will never love me again.
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain

I'm keeping my eyes on Delaware as I think they have the right idea. Don't try to get wall Street to accept cryptocurrency. Put Wall Street on the blockchain so cryptocurrency acceptance is obvious.

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high,
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue,
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true.
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me.
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly.
Birds fly over the rainbow.
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Security Notes
Storing Credentials Securely
You should take great care to ensure your credentials are stored securely. If someone obtains your api_key or an access_token with the send or all permission, they will be able to send all the bitcoin out of your account.
In particular, you should avoid storing these credentials in your code base (which gets added to version control) or in your database unless you have encrypted them securely. Separating credentials from your code base and database is a good practice.
API key access is turned off by default on all accounts. So if you decide to do an API key integration, you will need to enable it first and take the necessary steps from then on to store it securely. You can always regenerate your API key (or disable it) if you feel it has been compromised.
Validating SSL Certificates
It is also very important that your application validates our SSL certificate when it connects over https. This helps prevent a man in the middle attack. If you are using a client library, this may be turned on by default, but it is worth double checking. If you see a setting to 'verify SSL' you should always ensure it is set to true.
