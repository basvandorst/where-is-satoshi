No, sorry if I didn't explain that properly. If you can build a virtual computer using alt solutions like SIA for disk storage and another coin for buying CPU power, can you build a virtual bitcoin miner using alts? Does that make sense? (Could be a very dumb question).

Every person and business in China accepts payments through tencent's wechat wallet and to a lesser extent alipay. Neither company can allow cryptos to load those wallets without the government's approval. I'm not sure if their actions would harm or help bitcoin as they be aiming to use one of the homegrown crypto platforms.

I'm almost embarrassed to admit that aside from freecell, scrabble and a freebie version of angry birds that a friend installed on my ipad, I've never played a computer game. I keep saying, one day I'll get into it and no one's going to see me for the next year.

Thanks! And that is my next step.

Most players have probably made their decision about whether to sell or hold and are now in wait and see mode.

In China they have apple pay and same deal, no one uses it. But they also have wechat which is a mobile version of facebook, which everyone (~750M users) has, and wechat has a wallet similar to Apple Pay which everyone uses. I used wechat wallet for 10 days and I can safely say it was a transformative experience. You first link it to your bank account, walk into eg a 7-11 or starbucks, buy a drink, you scan your phone and that's it. Instantaneous. You send money to one of your contacts or say a taxi driver or top up your mobile phone. You book and pay for an uber or a hotel. The receipts come straight to your wechat account. In ten days I didn't touch my actual wallet and when I left and had to go back to paying cash or card I was really quite sad. It was actually fun to use. I even managed to get an instantaneous refund from walmart when I bought the wrong size clothes (easy to do in china). Basically for wechat users the credit/debit card is history and so is cash. I have seen the future and I like it. Yesterday I was standing in line and some woman was fumbling in her purse for some change and I had to bite my lip. Perhaps one day wechat will be able to be topped up with crypto but using it with the existing banking system gave me the same thought as you. What do I need crypto for again? Perhaps anonymity but very rarely.

You should try to visit one of the hundreds of bitcoin farms all over the world. Power and decentralization are the least of any worries.

You're right, the only way to find out is to try it and see.The current argument for btc is that if the blocksize is increased there is a risk of centralization and security will be negatively impacted. I think that's a nonsensical argument.

I just thought about that movie.

It reads like a bad tv paid advertisement. And now a word from our sponsors....

It's a good video and it could apply to the internet in general but I'm not sure if the analogy works as well for bitcoin and blocksize. Blocks are more like trains or car ferries and increasing the blocksize is akin to increasing the number of carriages and hence the number of passengers. The part that is true is if the blocksize is increased it will improve performance but then more people will start using it.

I've never agreed with that argument. Consider how much power the bitcoin network uses and how it's distributed across the world. It's a specious argument.

"On 17 December 2014, we finalised a number of rulings (a GST Public Ruling and several Income Tax Determinations) relating to the application of tax laws for bitcoin and similar crypto-currencies. All of these rulings have application to tax periods before their date of issue as they discuss the operation of laws that were already operative. However, the Commissioner of Taxation will not generally apply compliance resources to tax periods that started before 1 October 2014 for goods and services tax, or 1 July 2014 for other tax issues. This is for taxpayers that can show they have made a genuine attempt to determine the tax treatment of bitcoin and have adopted a consistent position on this in those past tax periods.
Does this section imply that if I provably bought a bitcoin back in 2013 and didn't touch it until this year that I am not liable for cgt?

There are many people questioning the price drop and many theories but I think a lot of people who bought earlier in the year simply decided to take some profit. With bitcoin, unlike just about any other so called market, if there are more sellers than buyers, the price drops and vice versa.
