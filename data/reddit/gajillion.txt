yeah banksters are running the shadow government that prints money out of thin air, thats how central banking, money supply, and basically every aspect of economics of any country work .
Just looking for an intelligent argument to what I wrote, but in my comment when I explained that the same situation wouldn't have occurred in USD versus the bitcoin with Gox you didn't have anything to rebute that with for some reason and now you've tried to sidetrack this into me not providing a real argument? Yeah great conversation , really insightful stuff there.  
@_date: 2014-04-16 06:53:47
great response, so why do  you disagree with me? I don't dislike bitcoin and i'm not sure what i'm jealous about.  Seriously though .

Another great example of why bitcoin isn't well suited as a currency and banks, fiat, and regulation are so awesome.
@_date: 2014-04-16 08:01:25
That is the most idiotic reply to my comment you  could. This is why you will be fucking poor for the rest of your life. Government banks get bailed out? Gox was allowed to fail ? Jesus learn something about finance and economics intead of reguritating this fucking pointless liberal retard shit you have picked up from reddit. Seriously, make a real argument not some simplistic comment that doesn't do anything.

The reason I roll through here every few weeks is because I think bitcoins awesome, its excellent for use as cash on the internet and elsewhere.  It doesn't seem like anyone involved to any degree with bitcoin is happy wioth that and is on a mission to promote it as a currency. It's not suited for it at all, most of the comments and arguments I have with people seem to not really even understand why they want bitcoin as a currency other than some very loose idea that this is for some reason much better than current systems but I don't know if I've ever read anything or talked to anyone that knows very much about economics or finance.  It's too bad the  majority of the community wasn't more interested in making it accessible and usable rather than some sort of monetary revolution against systems that actually aren't broken, evil or in anyway worse than that. Its the nature of these types of technologies like open source software can be that it will go in hundreds of different dirrections of course but I hope there's more work on making it easy to obtain without having to wire money and verify accounts on unregulated private exchanges.

There is at least equally much as much or more frauid and theft with bitcoin and the story would not have been the same if it been USD because account holders would have had their USD in a financial institution with accounts insured and account holders protected in the event of a crisis of some sort. Banks get robbed everyday and yet if this happens at your bank you don't loose part of your savings do you? Regulation and reputable financial systems aren't some evil old man trying to screw you, this is a solid and very important core of an economy and do an excellent job 99% of the time. There has always been and always will be corruption where there is money.  Bitcoin is a great vehicle for currency but not a good currency itself.

It's a good example of why bitcoin isn't a currency and the current banking system is so much better.

Zerohedge? That is one of the worst financial blogs going , everyday total economic collapse is imminent according to the garbage on there.  
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:53:24
Fiat currency is just another way for the New World Order to further control the population..... 911 was an inside job, one world government will strangle us all.  
What a circle jerk in here.  Seriously why does everyone that is involved in bitcoin seem to think that they're more knowledgeable than real economists, everything is a conspiracy and that gold backed currency was a near perfect system that was also taken away for some reason that is usually a conspiracy.

Stock's did not drop 7% on news from the FED.  You're referring to the drop in the Nikkei which had little to nothing to do with US economic news. I've been watching to see if there is any correlation like you would expect with gold / dollar and haven't seen any evidence of that. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 19:48:54
[Is this what you're referring to?](
@_date: 2013-05-20 01:19:19
I don't think I'd say the price of silver is higher than usual.  Quite opposite actually along with gold and one of those reasons is a strong dollar.  ;)
@_date: 2013-06-15 02:32:09
Yeah... that's not really a good start its only data, I want to hear why the US is going to experience a bond market collapse followed by a currency / economic collapse and why you think inflation or hyper inflation would destroy currency, faith in currency.   
@_date: 2013-06-14 22:29:49
I've got a conspiritard friend that has been spewing this crap for at least 5 years, any day now or at least in the "Next couple of Years". You've been warned....the end is near (by people who have no real knowledge of economics or finance).
@_date: 2013-07-03 23:46:54
Why don't you visit r/economics and discuss it? You'll get better discussion than you will in a bitcoin sub. 
@_date: 2013-06-15 17:52:18
How does that have anything to do with proving / disproving this? This statement about bond market collapse and currency collapse are in no way 'mathematically inevitable', if you really believe that and with your superior knowledge of finance then why don't you give me the details on this mathematical inevitability? Please don't tell me that I don't have 'any knowledge of finance' , you're defending an overly simplistic doomsday prophecy on a bitcoin forum.  
@_date: 2013-07-06 04:19:43
Debasing currency? Don't think thats what is happening or will be anytime soon.  If you're referring to quantitive easing you should look into it a little more , that's not how things work.  Hate to sound like a dick but I see that same thing repeated over and over in this sub and a few others and it drives me nuts.  
@_date: 2013-06-25 03:20:18
Can you explain further about the selling oil for / USD?
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:37:36
Can someone tell me what all of this bitcoin is being used for currently? Seems to me that besides drugs and money laundering there isn't a big volume of it being traded anywhere. Every time I've used bitcoin in the past it was a complicated expensive hassle.  While I do like bitcoin for a type of internet cash I don't understand why anyone would want or need this as a currency to run a nation.

I agree, I'm Canadian but we have the same thing here with RRSP's.  If you take it out you pay a huge percentage in tax, if you leave it in the account that is set up where you work you only get a few shitty choices of mutual funds.  Where I work we can transfer it to a self managed account with a bank which is good if you're comfortable managing it on your own.  Not sure if you can do that in the US or not.

Well for one thing the market cap of bitcoin is quite small.  If there was any amount of money  coming in as there would be if this was in some way correlated to investors moving out of stocks and into bitcoin it would move the price more than a few dollars. Sure there would be a few investors but there isn't enough to say its correlated.

If a bank was offering a 7000%+ interest rate on a savings account I don't think I'd feel safe putting my money there.  What a stupid comparison, if you think that a return of 7000% is good and safe the world is going to eat you alive, lol.  Bulls make money, bears make money and pigs get slaughtered.

You mean it didn't turn into a libertarian utopia?
@_date: 2013-06-30 19:10:56
Ok makes more sense, when I first read it I thought you meant you lost 30% this year and was thinking WTF?  Good to hear you didn't though.
@_date: 2013-06-30 03:15:42
How did you lose 30% in your 401k this year? markets have been ripping for months now.  Unless youre referring to another year.  
Edit: I see youre probably replying to the 6% statement.  Thats possible I guess.  
@_date: 2013-06-14 22:34:02
I'd love to hear a detailed break Down of how this currency collapse / bond market collapse is going to happen since it's mathematically inevitable.
