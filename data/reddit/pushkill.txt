Is coinbase effectively the comcast of crypto?
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:04:36
I shared this with my parents

My predictions are "boom" will continue to be one of the most overused words in the english language.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:28:43
Yeah, pay your taxes people, don't take this guy literally.

Yes, you have realized its value and chose to reinvest it. The IRS see's that as a taxable event.

Do lambos hold their value?

You and I both know he isnt talking about anything with any factual basis. He is just blurting out buzzwords so it looks like he knows what he is talking about to his elderly colleagues.

this is the wild west dude, anything can happen. If you cant stomach the losses get out, seriously, dont let FOMO get the best of you.

HE SAID "HOW CAN A BUBBLE BE REAL IF MY EYES AREN'T?"

Fuck yes, they layed out a model for society that we should all strive for. Iirc the world had to have a massive nuclear war before it was ready to progress to the world tng portrayed.

You need to share them and get people to click your links on sites like facebook, reddit, blogs etc....

Do it. If you dont care about the 60 and understand that not only bitcoin, but all crypto is akin to gambling at this point and that you might lose it all in a matter of minutes, please do it. The more people in the game the better. Anyone giving you "expert" advice is full of shit, this is all uncharted territory and no one knows what will happen for sure.

Just remember,  no crypto is a safe investment. This shit is volatile and still somewhat under the radar, who knows what will happen when the financial institutions feel threatened. I don't blame your wife, I'd try to convince her to invest a smaller amount for fun rather than a "profitable" investment. That way when there is a dip she doesn't divorce your ass.

You mean jacksonville.

England, you do realize Hawaii has pizza delivery right? So delivering something in Hawaii isn't that big of a deal. It's not like he had pizza flown from the mainland.

You are better off promoting BTC to your community and using it as a form of payment for services and products.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:01:50
Don't do this. Keep your 401k, keep maintaining it. Any extra cash you come by and don't mind if it goes missing, that's what you put into crypto.

If someone got in around 2013, is there such a thing as a loss at this point?
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:22:09
That guy in the sky is a fuckhead and fucked over a lot of people. His name is Mark Karpeles.
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:21:16
For a second I was thinking you were talking about mark karpeles. Didnt he have some not-so-veiled hits out on him?
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:40:16
nope he had many drops
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:31:05
I agree and disagree, you are right if the companies you are investing in are growers, but the industry is very diverse.

I think general consensus is people born from the start of the 80s to 2000. That early group (80-85) is sometimes referred to as the Oregon trail generation.

1 down!

But only 1/10000th the extended edition
@_date: 2013-08-05 06:02:49
Commas would have definitely helped in this situation.
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:34:09
Yes.
