Can someone ELI5 on how there are such huge price differences between foreign exchanges? I can understand a few $$ but a 2k difference makes no sense to me, what am I missing?

Yep. Some people on this sub are deluded, they completely dismiss anything not in favour of bitcoin as nonsense and seem to think its a 100% safe investment.

I agree with you, most of my investments are fiat, and I have a relatively small percentage in bitcoin as well. It's the people claiming that bitcoin WILL be the currency of the future and expect to become millionaires from their early investments that worry me. They don't seem to realise that ANY investment is a gamble, whether the risk be high or low.

Could you ELI5 the whole Whale thing? I've seen an account on twitter called WhaleCalls or something which posts stuff I don't understand and I can't find anything on Google.

Its not the exact same site but bitcointicker.co is very similar.

theoretically if you were to cash it out into USD it would be around $200

I'm new to btc, what is 'the 21'? would I be right in saying that because bitcoins cap at 21 million units, if you own 21 you own 1/1,000,000 of btc wealth? Only thing I can think of
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:17:50
Yeah that was pretty much my point, I can't see bitcoins becoming the 'norm' until people that didn't grow up with or were never interested in technology start dying out, which is obviously happening as we speak.
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:10:19
How did you build this device? just bought an arduino kit and I'd love to make one, any guides?
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:04:20
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:32:07
eh? thats my point exactly. I think it will take a few decades because a lot of older people won't be buying them because they're so unconnected with technology, but as we shift to become the older generation, we will be used to trading with btc (hopefully).
I don't know why you're off on a rant about the older generation either, thats an entirely different matter.

Essentially he is trying to reduce the price of bitcoin, so he can buy them for a lower price than they were before he started attacking. Then, when the price of bitcoin goes back up, he will sell all of the coins he bought whilst the price was low, to make a profit.
@_date: 2017-01-27 17:26:14
Wherever you end up buying from I'd suggest doing an initial small purchase (say $10) and then a few more individual purchases to buy the other $4990 worth of BTC, if its your first time buying.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:41:20
Complete newcomer but if I was in your situation I'd cash a little more than my initial investment out to play it safe. It's entirely up to you.
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:06:37
I'm fairly new to btc but I can't see it growing that much for a long time, mainly due to the fact that btc isn't tangible. It sounds stupid to us, but I could never imagine my parents or grandparents buying ANY btc as they can only imagine them as 'virtual coins'.
edit as I think I was unclear - I am not disagreeing with the comment above, but I was suggesting that I can't see it happening over the next few years as the older generation is such a sizeable chunk of the total population, and from what I've seen many of them won't even sue online banking, nevermind buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:19:55
Ok sweet, thanks
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:27:40
hahah gotcha

Fair enough, I didn't mean to word it as I did.

a string of 12 random words automatically generated when you create your wallet
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:52:30
I agree with you almost entirely, what I was saying is that I think it will be unlikely that the CURRENT older generation will take to bitcoin, but it's just an assumption.
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:07:19
Sorry I somehow missed your reply. There should be a 'recover' option on the application you used somewhere, which will prompt you to enter your seed. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:06:44
no problem
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:31:15
If you've got the wallet seed then just reset your wallet, if not them I'm afraid they're gone.
@_date: 2017-01-04 18:10:29
can someone ELI5
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:33:07
Going to spend the next few weeks trying to build my own I think, should be a fun little project. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 23:42:17
It could pay off well, but it's still a fairly big risk.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:24:41
you've gained nothing until you cash out, but congrats nevertheless 
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:24:32
2,100 btc sounds nice.
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:55:17
I'd suggest getting some professional advice, it's not something you would want some guy on reddit to tell you how to do
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:27:55
You'll be safer using a hardware wallet. I'd go to as you'll probably get better advise.

Exchange Traded Fund - essentially a portfolio of stocks managed by a fund. The Winklevoss twins (had very early Facebook involvement) were pushing for funds to be able to purchase bitcoins in the sense that they purchase stocks for clients, however it was rejected. 
That's my understanding of it anyway, I don't know much about finance.
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:52:32
Wow, how are you getting such low fees? Everything I've sent over the past few weeks has cost me $4+, and these are relatively small transactions ($50 max).
I'm more than happy to pay for a transaction, but 10%+ just isn't feasible.

I bought a small amount from Bittylicous once, the price is slightly higher than most other sellers though
