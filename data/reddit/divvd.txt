Nearly melted my iMac. Totes worth it
@_date: 2014-07-06 07:11:53
I can't believe that exists. 
*but I love it*
@_date: 2014-07-06 07:41:13
There are at least four large(ish) markets, not counting single dealer sites.

I still can barely wrap my head around the adoption rate. This is amazing. I remember when the only thing I was doing was mining with my iMac and buying exotic brands of cigarettes on the silk road.
@_date: 2014-07-06 09:54:37
I was referring to the fine tobacco products that were actually sold by some vendors on there. Actual Turkish camels, Canadian smokes with the cancer mouths on them...etc.
And I never bought anything in pill or powder form.
@_date: 2014-07-05 19:38:08
That's the point

AM I BEING DETAINED
I was thinking tar heroin because of its prevalence in jazz too.
Totally not what I bought. 
Either of them.
Exotic. Cigarettes. I promise.

Nice. 
There are so many more markets now that actually compete so your coin goes further.
Big loss, small gain

Bitcointip, eh?
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:05:12
I think it's after that considering I think I used it in 2013 to buy from silk road
@_date: 2018-03-02 23:41:50
Alright. Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:17:12
Is bitcoin qt obsolete? I was planning on firing it up for the first time in years as I used to use it as my wallet just too see if there was any coin in it. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:33:17
Should've put it eth or monero
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:21:14
I like your moxie
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:29:55
OK cool. I'm hoping it dips below 40, into the mid thirties (sooo hopeful, lol) before I check out. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:50:50
I am sofuckingglad that my bank account just verified with Coinbase and that they have been out of coins due to high, high, high trading. 
I have been mining since 2011, I think -- it was 5 bux per BTC when I started -- and wished I would have purchased then. 
That's why I got on Coinbase last week and never purchased (AKA got lucky because of fate). Am I a bad person for wanting it to tank a titch again so I can buy some big BTC?
@_date: 2013-03-05 21:27:19
They are, but goddamned those fees!
Coinbase has been 'out' since like 6:30 this morning. We'll try tomorrow.

Considering I use my husband's laptop and my iMac's HDD is unmountable... Could you give me a reason?
Oh, forgot to mention that the HDD on the laptop is PGP encrypted. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:31:55
Thank you, man! Pays out the same as a Satoshi Dice bad roll! I'll take it. :D
@_date: 2013-07-04 02:43:22
Only comment on this thread that I have fully appreciated. Thank you, kind sir (or madam)
@_date: 2013-02-19 23:13:11
Oh so that's what it's doing. Thank you. I was like... no, no, no, I can't be out of sync by 200k blocks. i synced two days ago. 
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:48:08
Sad. I just don't have any other way to get it. Is Bitinstant up?
@_date: 2013-02-19 23:11:58
Just in case you guys don't know ahead of time: 
I used the installer .exe for Windows, so I don't know if this is true for all, with default settings. 
It appears to have deleted the block index. It's now rebuilding (luckily my wallet stayed) and has 192,000 to go. :-\
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:06:46
yeah, while I was typing my original message I saw it go up quite a bit. I typed a little before I stopped myself to check bitcoincharts, then noticed freezing of the servers, headed over to a couple more sites, and finished typing. It had all but recovered... I was too lazy to edit. Bah. 
@_date: 2013-02-20 00:34:43
phew, thank you. I read it somewhere else on this post and forgot to delete mine. Then again, had I done that I wouldn't have gotten the in-depth description you gave. 
Thanks again!

I was so pissed -- coinbase just added my bank account *today* after almost a week of tring. I wanted to get in when it was still 32/33. I started after the initial crash. I really am kicking myself for not buying the shit out of it when I had a job and it was 5USDish
Oh, and I know this is more general question -- does coinbase not allow purchases on the first day? Or do you have to buy your full limit? I wanted to get 1 BTC and I couldn't.
