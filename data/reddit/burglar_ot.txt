According to Lukejr we shouldn't use SegWit now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:37:04
probably your settings is limiting the maximum mempool size of your node and you do not see it.
Try to search the address in blockchain.info you will see the transaction unconfirmed (probably forever if it is in the bottom of the pool).
If this is the case you should find how to increase the maxmempool size parameter on your client (I do not know in windows).

we shouldn’t be so happy. Lulejr says not to use segwit before LN.

I still think that it was a mistake to call the NYA as an attack. It was a possible occasion to reunite the Bitcoin community under a proposal that just  one year before was approved by Blockstream too (HKA).
Now the war continue with Bcash that try to steal the name and generate background noise continuously.

one year before, in Hong Kong, it was proposed exactly the same agreement and the developers signed for it.
It was not a small bunch of people.
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:19:48
This is your interpretation and it is not necessarily the reality. Both proposals were SegWit plus 2x fork. But I do not want to convince people, I prefer to link the two proposals and who wants to spend some time to read them can formulate his own opinion.
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:14:39
one thing that cannot be affected by SegWit is the speed of the transaction because the block generation is still one every 10 minutes. You probably were not lucky with the network congestion in that moment or you put fees too low.
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:53:06
You want the proof that the blocks are mined every 10 minutes?

@_date: 2017-02-26 18:47:33
It seems you do not know how mining works. The difficulty is adjusted to have 1 new block every 10 minutes.
If today miners will not see it profitable anymore they will stop mining, the difficulty will decrease and people will mine with their mobile phone accepting the transactions fees as payment.
The difficulty adjustment is the mechanism to keep the mining alive because the network will always stabilize on a profitable level. Maybe we will see the end of ASIC mining, especially if the block size will not increase dramatically, but not the end of mining.

Think about mail in an office.
Public ip is the address of the reception and it is assigned by your city (internet provider) and has to stay there.
Private ip is your office room number within the building.
At the reception of your office there is the router that receive the incoming letters.
Your bitcoin server sits in your private room with an address that is known only by who is in the building but it is unknown by an external postman.
So you have to instruct your router that every time that someone send a letter to him (the only one with a public address reachable by outside) with a special tag, has to take that letter and deliver to your bitcoin computer in the office.
The special tag is called "port" in the internet communication.
Then, first of all you need to know the private address of your computer, that is something like 10.x.y.z or 192.168.x.y.
Write that address on paper.
Then you have to access your router configuration site and search the port forward configuration (sometime is under gaming menu) and there you have to say that every connection for the port 8333 has to go to the private address of your bitcoin computer (the one written on paper) on the port 8333.
The protocol is TCP.

No, this is why we should start with SegWit and, if it will not work, go for hard fork. Technically this is the only viable strategy.
@_date: 2017-02-14 20:49:47
From a technical point of view I do not see a better way to improve the blockchain. To hard fork without trying Seg Wit has no sense and I haven't read about any other upgrade with the same maturity of these two methods right now. So if you see another way I am curious to read about it.

Question 1: Bitcoin is based on a public logbook called blockchain. In this book you can write transactions between people. To have it working, you need to be able to add more and more pages (the blocks) such that everyone can have a space to write his transaction. The creation of a new page has to be complicate, otherwise someone can roll back the logbook, rip some page and rewrite the transactions saying that all the transactions are directed to him.
The creation of new blocks is the mathematical problem that is solved by miners. Because this is time and power consuming, the inventor of bitcoins had the idea to include a reward in the process: when you create a new page you can write on it that you own some bitcoin.
So technically you do not earn any money, you earn only bitcoins. The fact that today people are available to buy these digital transactions for $1000 per bitcoin is a pure social phenomenon and doesn't have anything connected to computers or math. The value of an object is totally a convention. We all agree that with some paper we can buy cars and with some other we wipe our ass. We give a huge value to stones (like diamonds) and nothing to other like the sand of a beach.
Question 2: I think the answer is related to the previous: if you buy them you are giving a value. If you consider them digital rubbish for you are digital rubbish. Your question should be: is the majority of the people in the world considering bitcoins as an alternative to cash? The answer is for the moment no, the bitcoin community is very small compared to the one that recognise cash printed by a state or plastic printed by Visa as a payment system, but it is growing more and more.
The hope is that new people (like you) will be interested and start to use them in order to replace money (at least for digital payments).
@_date: 2017-02-15 20:43:16
To understand bitcoins try to use familiar concepts.
Use for example dollars. Dollars are produced by only one person (the printer of USA) and managed by few people (banks).
If everyone relies on miners and nodes of someone else give to these people the power to control the bitcoins. The larger is the number of miners and nodes, the less is the power of a single person.

If your interested is just to learn how the blockchain is validated, this is an old implementation of a miner in python.

@_date: 2017-02-26 12:03:01
well in reality it should count what nodes are signaling. The miners are generating new blocks, but they have to comply with the rules of the nodes. They cannot simply ignore them and mine whatever they want.
I think the final choice of the miners will be strongly influenced by the network choice, especially in case of an hard fork. If they hardfork today they have 70% of the network with Core that rejects big blocks. For who will be in the BU branch seems very risky.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:55:39

the value is that they can "print" their own money. So they can generate new loans without the need of the cache. They already do it with credit cards, a digital currency issued by a bank is nothing more than a new credit system.

I disagree. Today the power is in the nodes. If tomorrow the miners will start to mine blocks considered invalid by the majority of the nodes, they will start to create a new altcoin, not bitcoins. The consensus is from the nodes that have to select which network they want to use. If the miners go for their way the bitcoin network will needs new miners, the difficulty to mine new blocks will decrease and a new generation of miners can born. This is the real power of the bitcoin network today and this is why the miners do not know which side to take because they know that they can ends in the wrong branch in case of an hard fork.
@_date: 2017-02-13 08:06:38
The value of bitcoins depends on how many people wants to have them. Noe the options are two: or we hope that the world is full of feticist of digital transactions that love to collect them as bitcoins, or we need to have bitcoins attractive as  micro payment system.
@_date: 2017-02-18 11:28:53
no. The miners today uses dedicated hardware that mines millions of times faster than any cpu or gpu.
These devices uses a lot of power and mining is profitable only in countries where the electricity is very cheap (China, India etc).
So don't waste your time mining bitcoins. You can try with other altcoin if it is still possible to mine them.

I mean to withdraw cash from your ATM and use it to buy bitcoins from a seller.
I know three possible ways to do this.
One is to buy from someone available to meet you and sell the bitcoins. The second is to send the money via mail to someone that will give you the bitcoins, the last is to find a bitcoin ATM close to you, insert the cash and get the coins in exchange on your wallet.
The first two methods are not very safe, the third is better but it depends where you live.
In any case my suggestion is to go on localbitcoins.com and explore the option cash in-person as possible way of shopping. If there is an ATM in your city it will show as cash possibility.
To be completely anonymous browse localbitcoins from a public wifi.

To have it recognized legally means that banks can start to change yen into bitcoins.
This can start a massive adoption because people trust banks more than exchanges.

the bubbles are generated by speculators. The last PBoC intervention reduced enormously the volume of short term trading and speculation. The price should be more stable now.
The growth will be exponential until the adoption will stabilize on a certain volume.  It can be 10,000 USD/BTC or 1 Million, nobody knows, it depends how popular bitcoins will be in the future.
An event that can have a temporary negative impact will be the change in block chain  (SegWit or hard fork), but I think this will be quickly absorbed by the market.

You can have a perfect cold storage with electrum. It is enough to create the private key on an offline machine and from them generate the public key for a read-only wallet online.
Every time you want to send a coin you create the transaction on the online wallet and you sign on the offline with the private key.
This way is one of the most secure way to handle bitcoins.

Think about your regular bank account. If you want to receive money you have to give your bank account number to the person that has to send you the money. This is the equivalent of the public address in bitcoins.
If you want to pay, you need a secret information that only you posses: the pin of your card, or your signature.
This is the equivalent of a private key for bitcoins.
A bitcoin wallet is a software that generates and store your private key and your public address to let you use bitcoins.
The papers wallets print the private key on paper and never store it on a computer.
So when you will want to send coins to someone you will have to input the key "manually" (or with some kind of scanner) in order to use the private key as signature.
The cold wallet keep the private key on a computer that never goes online. When you need to sign a transaction you prepare it with any computer, you transfert to the offline computer with a usb key and you sign with your private key. The signed transaction will be broadcasted to the word by a computer connected to the Internet.
The goal of these wallets is to prevent an hacker to steal your private key, because if someone has your private key can sign transactions for you and move all your bitcoins.

All the protocols cited in the email went through the same problems of blockchain, simply people do not remember. How to design IPv6 was not easy at all and the adoption is still very small.
HTTP went through horrendous discussion about how to implement tags for images, videos, etc. The story of how to do dynamics contents with Flash, Java, Javascript and today HTML5 is not yet over and it was done with a sort of "hard fork" when Apple decided not to use Flash in the iPhone forcing the developers to HTML5.
DRM is only a problem because it is simply an impossible technology. We see and listen things with analog devices (eyes, ears) and there is no way to protect all the chain, so that technology will never work. Who debate on DRMs do not understand the basics of information technology. I hope that who is discussing about blockchain is a bit more competent.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:46:44
I agree. The power of the network should be a balance between nodes and miners but it is completely unbalanced today.
For example the discussion between segwit or hard fork should involve the consensus of the nodes too, not just the miners, but it seems that nobody cares about the nodes while today they are largely (75%) with bitcoin core (segwit).
If in case of an hard fork the nodes will reject the new blocks mined with larger space and will go for segwit, this will create a new scenario where people will pay more attention to the nodes than today.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:54:53
No are not. The intention of the poll is to understand what people prefer about these two options. There is also the possibility of a nuclear war with 5 billions people killed where the technology of bitcoins can be a secondary problem.
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:30:24
In the test net it seems that SegWit provides in average 3-4 MB of space. In any case this is not the only and final solution. This is why the whole discussion shouldn't exists. The blockchain will be modified many other times in the future so there is no rush for an hard fork now.

Take a brand new computer that you do not use for anything else (a little raspberry with a wifi can work). Connect to the wireless of a Starbucks and Install TorWallet (
Buy bitcoins only with cash (any transaction from your bank account can be tracked soon or later) and use always a public connection to do all your bitcoin payments.
Remember that bitcoins are not anonymous, this is a legend. They are exactly the opposite: every transaction is on a public blockchain inspectable by everyone. It is enough that once in the history of your addresses there was a connection with you to track in a second everything you did.
@_date: 2017-02-28 23:23:37
I wonder how many people considered the early internet as a bad technology because to send a little information was definitely slower and more complicate than to make a phone call.
Bitcoin is suppose to replace the bank network, a technology invented 4000 years ago in Babilonia, and it should do it in its first 6 years of life?
Maybe we should be a bit more patient.
@_date: 2017-02-27 02:22:30
Why? First of all neither SegWit nor the proposed hard fork can solve the long term scalability. Currently the bitcoin network handles 3 transactions per second. VISA network can handle 24000 transactions per second. To have the same order of magnitude we need blocks of 8 GB !
There are other solutions for scalability like the lightning network.
Second, why a SegWit today will stop a fork in the future? It is the opposite: if SegWit will not be a good choice, everyone will be more than happy to try a different path with an hard fork.
The only case where an hard fork will not be done is if SegWit works well and people are happy with it. But I wouldn't call this situation as a problem, it is precisely what everyone in bitcoin business wants, except BU people that knows that SegWit can succeed and make their proposal useless.
The SegWit vs. hard fork story is a pure political tentative for the BU group to take over the Core power and has no technological motivation.
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:09:02
Bitcoin is the opposite of anonymous. Every transaction is registered on the public blockchain and it is inspectable by everyone. You can follow a coin in all its history.
What you don't know are the owners of the addresses, but if you can track back to the exchange and inspect the registered users of it, you can reconstruct the ownership.
The most anonymous way to buy trade them is with cache, but this is anonymous because the cache is.

Adoption of bitcoins as payment method.
If Amazon, eBay and other big shops will start to accept bitcoins (directly or through an escrow system like Paypal) the value of bitcoins will increase significantly.
Also adoption for micro payments in IoT is another huge use of bitcoins.
You are right: SegWit or Hard Fork will be positive in the long term, but if the change will be imposed without 95% of consensus, who doesn't like the decision may try to push for its own fork, with some temporary chaos.
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:20:08
well, somehow this is happening. Since Core version 0.13.1 the nodes are SegWit ready. It means that they are capable to accept them as valid blocks.
The question is what the miners wants to mine.
@_date: 2017-02-09 18:35:38
Of course you cannot connect the public addresses to the private key, but this is not required to track the coin.
Let say the police jails a drug dealer and wants to know if you bought from him. It is enough that they control if his public address had exchanged with your public addresses.
@_date: 2017-02-15 20:34:35
bitcoin is a big logbook where people write their transaction. If I give you a bitcoin I write on the book that I am giving to you my bitcoin and you receive it, we both sign and we are ok.
This technology works if every user of the book accept that book as the only one with valid transactions. If someone else start to use another book and rewrite all the transactions, he can say that I never gave that bitcoin to you.
Today everyone agrees about one book to use, but there is a problem: many people are doing transactions and the space on the pages runs always over, so people has to wait for new pages and this can take long time (by the way, you pay a fee to write the transaction in the book, the more you pay the higher is your priority to write in the book).
So someone is proposing to use a new book with bigger pages. If this is done all the transactions written in the old book will be copied in the new one and a new logbook will start. Your coin will exist in two separate registries: the old, with small pages and the new with big pages.
It is very possible that not everyone will want to use the new one but only a fraction of the old users will use the new book. So we may have a fork of the blockchain (the logbook) in two new blockchains.
One effect is that the exchanges has to choose which blockchain to use, they can even accept the two blockchains and exchange the two kind of bitcoins for fiat. In this scenario, who owns bitcoins today will double his coins (but maybe the value will be the half because of the inflation due to the duplication). It is also possible that the community will chose to continue only with one blockchain and stop to use the other.
This is an Hard Fork.
@_date: 2017-02-13 09:53:12
it seems that China is leaving the bitcoin business. For me it is incredible to see how passively the exchanges, that are private companies, accept to have the business destroyed by the government.

@_date: 2017-02-05 04:48:57
Then what is the discussion of segwit or hard fork about? Let's start to mine today what we want and make bitcoins great again! I will mine blocks with 1000 btc as reward and zero difficulty with 100MB of block space.
The miners are the people currently implementing the rules of bitcoins. Even if anyone can become a miner, the current community of miners is who will decide the next block technology. This is why bitcoin core would like to have 95% of miners for segwit before turn it on.
We can stay here and discuss years about the real power of the miners, but practically their weight in these decisions is much bigger than the one of anyone else in the bitcoin community.

Sad story, it seems you lost a brother and a very wise investor in the family.
My suggestions:
Don't trust anyone. Study and learn how bitcoin works and avoid help from people that you don't know very well.
Buy an hardware wallet (like Trezor or Ledger).
Every time you are able to access to your brother's coins transfert them on your hardware wallet.
Once you have all the coins that you can on your wallet, you can start to think about what you want to do with them.
If you do not have money problems, I would suggest to hold them because the coming years will be quite exiting.
If you want to sell them do it in little batches on different exchanges to see which one is the best for you.
Don't trade big money in one shot.
If you are unsure about exchanges, you can get the money from bitcoins ATM. Search on localbitcoins.com using the method Cash to see if there are any around you.
About his possible hidden bitcoins you have no way to find them.

Any computer is fine. If you have the knowledge I suggest you to use a raspberry pi with wifi dongle or equivalent because it is cheap.
For the ATM you probably need the cash and the public address of your wallet to receive the coins.

- DVD rise and fall in 10 years
- Nokia stocks went from $41 to $1.7 each in 5 years

This is an interesting question. Actually the reason why mining is in China isn't the large trade market there but the fact that the electricity is very cheap. If China will make difficult to trade bitcoins it is possible that some miners will stop the activity.
On the other hand this is not a real issue for bitcoins because if the competition decreases the difficulty of mining will decrease and it will become profitable to mine in countries with higher power cost.

right now the block are frequently full and this generates a queue to have the transaction approved. It is more a technical problem than a question of money. Of course if you increase the fee you move upward in the queue, but the transactions are so many that the problem requires a different way to fix it.
The solution is a series of changes in the blockchain: modify the space in the blocks, add side chains, or other proposals that are currently under evaluation.
The mechanism to change the blockchain rules is trough a large consensus if we want to keep one bitcoin and not several altcoins.

Today you can gain something mining only if you invest in big computer power. To do that you have to use an ASIC computers that you can buy online. The problem is that those computers use around 1kW power (even more). So it is like to have your microwave or vacuum cleaner running 24h.
If the electricity is not very cheap in your country (basically if you do not live in China or Georgia) you will not gain enough bitcoins to pay the bill.

You are right, but an hard fork with a small support from the community is meaningless.
The 95% can be changed in one of the next releases, even if I think it is a wise choice. The foundation of bitcoin is consensus and I like this approach more than any other thing. It is the tentative to take decision son something important like money talking and convincing people instead of imposing with the force.

Core devs are not the only people capable of developments. SegWit is an interesting idea but not the solution of all the bitcoin challenges for the future. So if they stop the development, another group will continue to improve it. If miners think that the block issue is the only problem to solve from here to the next 10 years, they have no idea what a revolutionary software is.

Of the 392893 lines of code, how many did you inspect personally to be sure that there is no malware hidden in the code?
From my comment you should understand that I am setting up a node. Actually I want to setup a bitcoin node and an electrum node. This because I like SPV for light applications but I prefer to have a server with the full blockchain. Still I think that the procedure to setup a new node should be faster than it is today, otherwise the new nodes will be less and less in the future. Not only, probably many people running a node will stop at the first crash because they will need forever to recheck the blockchain from the beginning.

What you need to be able to spend your bitcoins is the private key.
In your current hardware there is a program that is capable to convert the seed in the private key.
If you change the hardware you need a new one that uses the same algorithm.
For this reason there are standards today to enforce a compatibility between the seeds, so can be good for you to know what uses your hardware wallet in order to know what to use in the future if you need to replace it.

small is the amount of money that you don't mind to much to be stolen.
It is valid the same security that you use for your fiat. You keep up to few hundred of bucks in you wallet but you keep your millions (hope that you have) in a safe place.
Everyone decide what is a small amount depending on his/her wealth. My small is, today, less than 0.5 btc, for Satoshi is probably 1000 btc.
@_date: 2017-02-15 19:17:32
you trust bitcoin core site when you download and install the program to manage the node. If you install the executable you check the sha256 and this would be equivalent to check the hash of the blockchcain. If you compile from source you trust that the repository is not poisoned because I do not believe that you inspect a code that requires hours to be compiled (just done).
So the whole question is meaningless. By the way, I am sure that you haven't inspected the wallet that you use to trade bitcoins, you trust the exchange during the trading, you trust your bank that doesn't steal your money from your account and you trust your government that doesn't send the police to arrest you without any reason. We take little risks trusting each other every day, and the one I am saying is extremely small if you can cross check the checksums on different nodes with a significative improvement of the speed.

I take the data from Coindesk for one week, one month, six months, one year and two years and I fit with an exponential.
The goal is to see the trend of the bitcoins (and to hope for the million).
So, for example, if you take the 2 years plot (the last one) you see that the function is 194.84 x 2.13 ^ t where t is the time calculated in years.
It means that at the beginning (April 2015) one bitcoin was $ 194.84, and then it multiplied by 2.13 every year. According to this today it should be $ 890.45. It is much more in reality (more than $ 1000), so probably it is increasing even faster than 2.13 times per year right now. Anyway if it stay at this rate, 1 bitcoin will be a million dollars on June 7th 2026.
The other graphs have the same meaning but the data are fitted with different time intervals. For example the first is for the last week where the general trend was not very good.
In this way I can see how dramatic is an increase or a drop of the price compared to the general trend.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:40:20
I think the difference is in the cost: run a node can be done for few watts, while mining requires several thousand of watts.

Core is approaching the problem technically as IT experts would do. BU is requesting the new super-duper feature as the boss of the IT company would do. The fact is that both approaches are compatible if done one after the other and there is no need to hard fork now.
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:47:20
A best solution exists and this shows that BU doesn't want the best for bitcoins but they simply want to become the new Core (in fact this story is a fight for power).
Let's say that SegWit is a terrible solution, fine, this could be. Then let's try it and if doesn't work we go for hard fork. Nothing simpler than this.
Every engineer in the world would recommend to use the smoothest solution first and the hardest later if you have the possibility to choose.
We are not rushing, we have all the time to try a solution like SegWit now and fork later.
90% of bitcoin users probably wouldn't even notice the impact of SegWit if activated today except for an improvement in the velocity of approvals (because the 2mb block size). While an hard fork would generate panic in people that have to manage their coins in two chains.
If this is the solution I accept it, but why not try the other one before?
So for me the real question that BU should answer is: why not SegWit? What can go wrong that cannot be corrected with an hard fork later?

The money in a bank is not your because you do not have control on it.
Scenario 1: a crazy guy takes the power in your country and screw the economy so much that banks have difficulty to allow people to spend more than $10 per day. So you cannot buy anything with your money because your bank promised the same money to someone else.
Scenario 2: the same crazy guy has the brilliant idea to insert in the system billions of new dollars to help the banks. The result is that now the Swiss cheese that you love so much costs like your car, and you cannot afford it anymore (so sad).
Scenario 3: the  nazi-vegan revolution party win the election and decide that your activity as farmer is illegal. And because you gained money on the sufferance of animals your money will be confiscated.
Scenario 4: your bank was investing in a chain of pubs called drink-for-free that went bankrupted (wonder why) and to fix their liquidity problems they decide to triple your expenses on the account.
Scenario 5: the ministry of you-must-be-fit decide that burgers are illegal because too fat. You are a good citizen but after 20 years without a juicy burger you would like to taste one before dying. You still remember the old times when cholesterol was your best friend. You know also that close to your place there is an illegal burger shop but you will not go there because if you buy with your card the transaction will be signaled to the police.
I can continue, but the concept is that even if everything seems fine now, you never know how things can evolve in 20 years and to control the money is the first way to control people. This can happen for political economical or simply random reasons and the single person may want to have a way to escape a system that is oppressing him and money is the only real power that people outside politics.

The paranoia of trust, at this level, is a bit ridiculous. When we download the bitcoin executable from bitcoin core we check the sha256 from their site to see if the executable is correct.
If the site is fake and the sha256 is fake we are downloading a malicious bitcoin daemon that will sync a fake chain and validate fake blocks.
I do not see why this is perfectly acceptable by everyone and to download the hashlist of the files from bitcoin core site is not acceptable. It is exactly the same level of risk, with the difference that the hashlist can be also verified with other nodes.
I am not talking about trusting anyone for the new blocks hashes, I am just saying that there should be a faster method to setup a new node, because to spend weeks to validate a blockchain that is already validated by thousand other people is pointless. It should be enough that the entire checksum of the blockchain up to the moment of the setup is the same as the checksum of the other chains distributed in the world. Then anyone will continue to validate their own blocks as usual.
The only point that I understand is to verify the consensus rules, that is something more difficult to validate in a quick way.

History of cryptography is full of example of new machine or algorithms broken by hackers. This can happen with quantum computers or by someone clever enough to find a weakness in the current hashing mechanism.
As soon as this problem will be exposed, the community will find a fix. It is impossible to fix a problem that is still unknown. We have no idea today how a quantum computer can practically attack the bitcoin algorithms, so we do not know how to defend it.
One thing that is fun is how many people are concerned by this problem that maybe will happen 40 years from now, and then leave their bitcoins on the exchange website that can be hacked anytime.
Those are the same people that use the home banking without thinking that the computer can have a malicious software stealing their bank credentials.

every node replicates the entire chain with all the transactions. So when a node receive a new block with transactions, it will transmit the information to all the other nodes in order to sync the network. This is the relaying that you see. The blockchain is a database replicated on each node where the miners add the new blocks and transmit them to the nodes. The nodes verify that the new block was created according to the rules and propagate to other nodes.

It seems you haven't read the title of the thread and you are continuing answering random things.
I summarize: PBoC did an inspection and as result OkCoin and Huobi stopped withdraw operations. Then many other exchanges had their website down. The thread is about why these websites were down.
My hypothesis are two: the traffic moved rapidly and overload the websites of these exchanges that collapsed or the exchanges closed with the excuse of a technical problem on the website to prevent the wave of panic.
The fact that you repeat that OkCoin and Huobi stopped the withdraw is totally irrelevant for this discussion.

Can you explain why these sites fear the Chinese problems?
Or it is just a problem of traffic? Than it is a bit strange considering that the transactions on these sites didn't increase so much.
So, please, use a bit more the spoon of knowledge and explain me why several exchanges outside China with a relatively normal traffic were down together.

Ahhhh finally a good old technical discussion about the real problems of technology!
Yes, to undo SegWit (but more in general any significant soft fork) is complicate because we need to keep the backward compatibility to be able to read the blockchain.
This means that a fork that wants to cancel the modifications of SegWit has to include a check on the block height and accept it until the block of the fork and reject from that moment on.
We have to survive with this problem because even the best soft fork with 100% of consensus can show a major problem that has to be removed in the future, but still the blocks with that fork has to be validated in the chain.
@_date: 2017-02-15 13:14:41

transfers take age because of the space in the blocks, not because there are few or more miners. The block generation is a constant (1 every 10 minutes) even if the number of miners is gigantic. The difficulty is adjusted to keep it constant.
The problem today is the block size limit and everyone in the development of bitcoin network is working on a solution.
Just to remember something about this story of the speed: do you remember when credit cards were totally offline? There was a machine with carbon copy paper to stamp the number on a receipt. Then the person had to bring all the receipts to his bank and have the money.

I think a reasonable compromise of SegWit + 2MB now and a long discussion for a next step would be the best for everyone. But now the discussion is about politics and power, not technical solutions and the groups are in a war that will end only with a fork.
I personally do not like the BU solution because the arbitrary block size in the hand of miners is a nonsense, plus the quality of their code is far from optimal. I would prefer the SegWit activation but as shown in testnet the average increase of size is around 1.7MB, that would be filled immediately. The consequence is a rushing LN that probably will be done in a too centralized way. For this reason it is better a 2MB increase and SegWit.
But nobody will listen at this and everyone will wait for the fork.

I think the criteria should be a bit more generic: the bitcoin network accept the change. Nobody should impose to a large fraction of the network its wish. So we should have a general voting system for everyone involved in the network (nodes, economical nodes, miners) and we may want to give a weight to each vote depending on their contribution (i.e. nodes count 1 economy count 3 miners count 5). Than we will approve changes, soft or hard, when a large majority is established in this voting system.
The vote should be recorded in the blockchain and publicly available. We are all partners in this business and nobody can succeed without the others, so we should stop to force others to a stupid war and start to take decisions only when are largely shared by the entire network.

You are right, sorry I cancelled my comment because I haven't read well enough your post.
I read the original post of shaolinfry and he answer to many concerns similar to yours.
This is the original thread: 
I found it very interesting and it sounds a reasonable proposal for me.
The spoofing of nodes seems a concern, but the idea is to use the nodes for the role that they have: enforce the blockchain rules. The 95% of miners is a good solution for a soft fork because automatically the fork is in place in the new blocks while the network can take a long time to upgrade, but if the network can be all updated up to a large majority, the effect will be the same. The miners will most probably mine for the updated network if the exchanges and the wallets are all there and the old nodes can still run because a soft fork is backward compatible by design. Only the miners mining with the old rules will be out of the game mining blocks that are invalid for the majority of the nodes and accepted by the old nodes. This may generate a split, but the risk for the miners is very big (bigger than for an hard fork) to be on the "wrong" chain loosing their mined coins.
IMO this method can solve the decisional problem if the spoofing is avoided somehow. Moreover I think that a period of signaling is useful also for the miners to understand the wishes of the nodes.
This network was created with nodes and miners and the perfect evolution would be to have an agreement between a large majority of the two.
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:38:38
Or, people can see the hard fork as a failure of the bitcoin and sell on both chains. Maybe buying Ethereum or returning to fiat.
I think the global value will drop significantly at the beginning and somehow I hope so, just to show how stupid is the idea of an hard. fork without a big consensus.

The long time is the effect of the success. Bitcoin is a 7 years old technology.
Credit carda are 80 years old technology.
Do you remember when the credit card number was stamped on a special carbon copy card with the mechanical machine? That transaction was then sent to the bank and validated one by one by an employee. Total time of operation: weeks!

I summarize the level of security for Wallets in three categories:
- a wallet on third party server. Security level = shit. If someone owns your private key owns also your bitcoins. Soon or later your money will disappear, especially if bitcoins will continue to increase.
- wallet on your computer connected online. Security level = half shit. The software can be secure and very well written but if your computer will be under the control of someone else, your private key can be stolen. Even if it is encrypted, the person that attacks you can monitory the keys you press and steal your password. With the two factor authentications is a bit safer but with enough time the attacker will find a way to steal all your identity.
Moreover the attacker can erase your private key or lock everything with a ransomware.
- private key always offline. This is the only secure option. The offline can be paper or digital, there is no big difference in the level of security. This solution is good for long term storage but can be not very efficient for day by day trade because the authentication to send bitcoins has to pass through some slow procedure.
So, to answer to your question, if you use Electrum with cold storage, then you are mostly safe. The other options are not safe.
This paranoid attitude is valid only if you have several bitcoins. For small amounts almost every solution is good.
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:19:06
Many, but we cannot do anything. The hard fork is a feature of bitcoin and if a large fraction of users/miners want to do it you cannot stop them.
I think in the end the hard fork will drop the price for a while and it will recover soon when the miners of the loosing branch will move to the winning branch.

What you are saying here was repeated for one year on every forum, and what is the conclusion? A fight that is worst and worst with a drop of $300 and a possible disaster in case of a fork. You have two ways: continue to blame people or find a way to collaborate.
BU did it wrong? Ok, fair, but they are still giving voice to a significant part of the network, that it is part of Bitcoin. So probably it is useful to try to listen to those people and not only to call them theft (of what? of open source?) attacker and bad actors.
I don't blame anyone, it is not useful, I think what we need now is to stop the fight and find a common proposal.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:36:08
in reality is quite simple: bitcoin has a problem because the blocks are full, this makes the transactions slow and expensive.
One group (BC) wants to solve it with changes that are small and backward compatible, the other (BU) wants to change with a sharp modification of the block size.
Both ideas can be technically valid, the problem is that bitcoin is primarily about money. So BC fears that a big change can destroy the value of bitcoins because it world split the chain in two with a duplication of the coins, while BU says that the change will be for the best and there is no reason to do it slowly.
I oversimplified but this is the problem.

Everyone agrees that the block size has to be updated. So the fork will happen eventually. The point is that it should happen in a sequence of events where everyone agrees to do it, not forcing people with a little majority (or a large minority).

If you setup 100000 new nodes you can start to mine blocks with your own rules and validate them. Basically you can hard fork alone.
If the hard fork is accepted as the main bitcoin chain or another altcoin it depends on what the traders want to do.
If you own 51% of the current nodes (even the non "real economic") you have the power to change the rules of the network.
You can start to mine with your own rules and validate the blocks. The rest of the network can adapt to your rules or fork to another network, but in both case you have a lot of power on the network. The nodes are not "observers" of the blockchain, they are the backbone of the network and the place where the real power is.

Every time PBoC enters in the game the price drops, but every time it drops less and recover faster.

In test net was very uncommon the 4mb (8 with a 2mb increase) block. The large majority was &lt; 2mb. So the risk is limited.
About filling the available space I think there are thousand of people that are waiting to jump on bitcoin but wait for the resolution of block size problem. Many companies are planning to offer bitcoin payments for shops but today the fees are too high.
With lower fees we will see an explosion of the market.

The mining has to continue even after the 100% because the new blocks are needed to store the transactions. So the mining will continue forever with the fees replacing the rewards.

Interesting guide. I did the same but synchronised on the Pi. The way I used to avoid the end of memory was to increase the swap and to put the bitcoind in a loop where it was stopped and started every hour. This would release memory and restart. The total time was 1 month to sync but after it runs well.
I have to say that Bitcoin Core should release a download of the updated blockchain and a pruned version for tiny computers because in the future this can be the only way to setup a full node.
Now I am setting up an electrum server and it is taking forever (another month I think).

Bitcoin is a high risk investment, you do not have to forget this.
If you ask here, a large fraction of the users believe that the price will rise 10, 100 or 1000 times compared to the current one.

Just to be clear: I think that miners are blind (or crazy) to go for BU. It is a suicide strategy. If the fork fails is a lost of money for them. If the fork succeed we will have a network based on a shit controlled by a bunch of incompetents. Hacking, DDoS, crashes will start to be the ordinary business with a lack of confidence in the network that will destroy the value.
So I do not think that miners do not have their quota of responsibility in this problem. They should search a communication with Core and ignore BU. But Core has to realize that their are maintaining a 20billions business with their code. They cannot skip the politics aspect of this anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:16:40
Several times it was proposed a solution with block increase and SegWit.
The Core team was very strict on it and refuse any possible block size modification.
Their claim is that it is not needed. After the malleability is fixed with SegWit they plan to enable the layer 2 with Lightening Network that should boost the number of transactions per second.
Personally I think that they should consider a compromise because LN will take time to be implemented properly and the risk is to have the solution of BU accepted by a majority of the hash power.
A 2MB block is not a big issue to manage after all.
But I do not think this will happen. Probably everything will be solved after the BU fork.

The rules of bitcoin network are approved by nodes. The smaller is the number of nodes, the higher is the possibility to manipulate the network. If bitcoins are profitable banks will enter in the business and them can do in two ways: one is to trade bitcoins, the second is to take control of the network buying it. If everyone can run a node it is to expensive to buy 50% of the network, if it is a small network it will be easily under the control of few people and bitcoin will become another payment system like visa under the control of banks or governments.

The Chinese government can modify the price of bitcoin just with announcements, without ETFs and without owning a single coin. They simply go to the exchanges and scare them.
Who moves big money will always be able to influence the price of a good or currency.
The idea that bitcoin has to be out of any control is ridiculous. Today the market cap is 20 billions. In 2009 the US government approved a 700 billions plan just to save the car industry. If they want, they can buy all the bitcoins in circulation, put in a wallet and throw it in the ocean. End of bitcoin. Or they may announce a ban and destroy the value.
Google could open a datacenter for mining, becoming the first haspower in the world and fork hundreds times. Or they can do googlecoin that is expendable on amazon, ebay, etc. and have a success that erase bitcoin from the market.
That's the market, we have simply try to emerge and integrate with it. The idea of a digital cash independent by the market is a non-sense.

This is called altcoin and there are several. Everyone can start an altocoin, mine and trade their coins for bitcoins. Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, all are like this.
BU wants to call it bitcoin. As you can see, the problem is not the technology, is a political problem.
Technically the problem does not exists. SegWit has many improvements and does not require an hard fork, so it could be enforced now. If the new block space is not enough, an hard fork is still possible to increase the block size (even if once the malleability is solved, the Lightning Network is a better solution IMO). So why someone should be against SegWit?

Cut 10% of decentralization for what? What is the benefit of 4mb blocks? For miners is 4 times the fee gain, for the network the change is nothing compared to the challenge of reach the transactions of Visa.
Fir this goal we should have 8 GB (yes Giga) of blocks. Clearly it is not possible, so it is time to stop the nonsense about. lock size and work seriously on the future.
SegWit now and lightning network as soon as possible.

As very simple abstraction, yes.


No, the only printed is the private one, the public can stay on your computer.


Yes, you can create as many as you want. One reason to use several wallet is that one is for long term storage (for example with the private key on paper, that is not so easy to use when you want to spend) and one for short term trade (for example a wallet on the mobile telephone for day by day usage.
Another reason can be to divide big money on different places to reduce the probability to have all the money stolen or lost in one shot.


I never bought monero neither on wesellcrypto, so I cannot help you here.


I do not know about monero. For bitcoin, every time you have a transaction a miner has to store it in a valid block. The miner wants some money (fee) to do this job, so every bitcoin transaction needs to pay a fee. I think monero is similar.

It will be a problem for a while, yes. Also because the number of transactions will increase significantly because all the scared people selling, but we cannot do anything to prevent a fork. The BU strategy will be to do it in the worst possible moment for Bitcoin chain in order to maximize the impact and promote their BU fork. We have to consider that the fork is not done in the interest of keeping the coin stable, but it is a strategy to create an altcoin to replace bitcoin.

The current hash rate is 3.5e18 H/s and it produces one block every 10 minutes with a reward of 12.5 bitcoins (we can say 13.5 bitcoins if we add the fees in the block). So the hashes you need for a bitcoin is
N H/btc = 3.5e18 H/s / (13.5 btc / 600 s) = 155e18 H/btc.
The S7 uses 0.25 Joule to calculate 1e9 H/s, that is 2.7e-7 kwh to mine 1e9 H/s.
To mine one bitcoin you then need
155e18 H/btc * 2.7e-7 kwh / 1e9 H/s = 41850 kwh.
Your electricity is $0.05 per kwh so you are going to spend
41850 * 0.05 = $ 2092.5 to mine one bitcoin.
The value of a bitcoin is around $1170 right now, as you can see you didn't do a good deal buying these cards.
You have to reduce your power cost to 0.02 to be slightly profitable, or bitcoin has to reach $2100.
With an S9 the story is different because it uses 2.55 times less energy for the same hash rate, so you would spend 820$ per bitcoin, and you would have a good gain.

The process to generate new blocks is random with a probability to generate a new block every 10 minutes.
The average means that a block can be find in one second or one year. The blocks 459783 and 459784 where found with a distance of 1 minute, while the blocks 459784 and 459785 where found with a distance of 49 minutes.
This wouldn't change with BU, SegWit or any other proposal. This is how the random process works and nobody is questioning it. The discussion is about how big has to be the block, not how frequently it has to be mined.
If you haven't understand this, probably bitcoin business is not for you.

No, you can sign offline every transactions as you can do today. The signature has no connection with the network.
Anyway I can accept criticism for the LN, is still a young idea, but to consider the increase of block size a scaling method is crazy.
To have a decent network the blocks have to scale to the gigabyte per block, it means nobody will be able to manage a node anymore.
The time validation for one block, on a normal computer, can be way more than 10 minutes, so people will not be able to keep the blockchain updated. Only specialized hardware will maintain the blockchain. In practice we will have a network managed by few powerful people, more or less like a bank network but hundreds of time more expensive to keep it alive. Very useful eh?

I also think the idea if bitcoin and blockchain is so great that will resist and will become a new mainstream technology. That's why in my first comment I say let's do it and see the effect. But I am not so naive yo think that the price will not be affected. The first couple of months will be a mess. Also because the forks will be two: after the hard fork, how remains will probably signal for segwit and the current chain will start it. So we will have the BU, the SegWit and some old node with no changes. The majority of the miners will split the hashpower in two to work on both chains (because nobody knows who is going to win) and everything will be done rushing because there will not be any preparation until the day of the split.

I think Vinny is perfectly right. The only way to protect the bitcoin investments in the long term is a bad reaction to the rumors of hard fork. It means less money for the miners that work at a constant expenses (mining is the cost of electricity). The idea that the price can drop significantly and stay down for a long period is the best motivation for miners to abandon their idea of short term gain with bigger blocks.

With hashrate of  3.3x10^18 H/s you. need to divide by 10 minutes (600 sec) to calculate how many hashes per block, that is: 2x10^21 hash.
An Antminer S9 calculates  1.4x10^13 hash/s, has to run for 1.4x10^8 seconds per block. It uses 1,375 kWh of energy, that is 
53472 kWh per block.
The coins per block are 12.5+fees, let say 15 coins. Then for a coin they use 53472/15 = 3565 kWh of energy per coin.
Nobody knows the price payed for electricity because it is a secret agreement. We can guess that is between 0.1 and 0.05 $/kWh, but it could be also free if the state wants to control the network.
So we can guess that the cost for them is probably less than $350 and more than $175.
I think the real cost of a bitcoin is double because of the hardware,  the datacenter, the sysadm maintaining the structure, the cooling, the network, the disks, plus the taxes to pay and the fees when they sell on exchanges.
Then their cost is probably somewhere between $350 and $700.

If you want to replace VISA you need to go from the current 3 transactions per second to 27,000 per second. The increase in the block size has to go then to 8GB per block.
Clearly this is not manageable with any normal computer, but only with the datacenter that Roger Ver can buy with his money.
The only possibility to have scalable networks that fit in an home computer is with side chains like Lightning Network and this can be done once the malleability problem is fixed as SegWit can do.
Roger Ver doesn't want to have a better network, he want to boost the current one until is useless, cash everything and destroy bitcoin.

Probably the first algorithms that will be implemented for quantum computers will be the crack of any traditional cryptographic key, so it will be very easy to find the private keys of everyone on bitcoins.
This will stay for very little time because people will start to create a new generation of cryptographic codes based on the power of quantum computers. So I would target the oldest address of bitcoins stealing few coins from thousand of wallets.
Of course this is all theoretical because I doubt that we will see quantum computers in our homes anytime soon.

Core does not communicate with miners. They say that miners want only to centralize the network.
This can be true or false, but in any case the  miners are part of this network. An important part actually and should be listened. The concern of miners for a stable income from the fees is not FUD is a real issue that deserve to be addressed. If we are in this situation is not because BU. They are so incompetent that they would never receive this level of attention alone. We are in this deadlock because Core didn't spend enough time talking with miners. BU did it and now miners prefer a bunch of dilettantes instead of a proper solution. What is the reaction of Core? Who cares about the miners! Well, I like the code and the solution of Core but they have to understand that bitcoin is no longer the same of Satoshi, it is hundreds of times bigger with miners and exchanges that created a business around it, not amateurs that can accept everything. It is time to growth up and discuss and find compromise with who is investing time and money i. the network.

If BU bases everything only on hash power, the price will stay stable within 100$ because after few days (or hours) the miners on their chain will stop to mine new blocks that are refused by the exchanges.
So they need to have the exchanges ready for the fork and this seems not easy as having the Chinese miners. Let see.
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:00:24
Your distinction between economically and not economically nodes is wrong. Every node has the same weight in the decision of the rules.
Miners are not more important than exchanges or than me in terms of nodes.
That's why there is no decision yet about block size. The miners knows well that if they start to mine blocks with new rules and the network rejects them they are out of the bitcoin network.
To give the power of block validation to few people means that the few people become like the bank network that can decide if your credit card is valid or not.

Lightening Network doesn't require centralization. Moreover it allows interoperability with other networks. So the blockchain can be replicated in a network with empty blocks (like Litecoin today) and be used for very little payments without fees.
To insist in increasing of block size is like to think to do bigger hard disk only increasing the size of their internal disks. Today 1 Terabyte would occupy a city. Software and technology evolves in new form every time. Bitcoin is a great idea that will go through many changes.

I really want the fork. I strongly believe that the proposal of BU is a shit, but I also am a scientist and when there are two team proposing a solution the only way to decide which one is the best is to try.
In a different word, I think the way is to implement the soft fork first, see how it performs and go for the hard fork later, because it is safer.
But it seems that the ass of BU people is in fire and they have to run to calm it, so let's run.
Let's see how brilliant is to have a 1gb block, the miners controlling the network and an unusable chain.

a bugged fork is can be always fixed. The problem of BU proposal is that it cannot work by design.

I cannot believe that a software engineer would ever approve such disgraced proposal.
In bitcoin the technology is everything and their proposal will start to day the same day of the fork. So don't worry, just hodl.

If they are not crazy, once they reach a percentage considered reasonable they will announce a date to start the mining of new blocks. This to allow the nodes to update with the new rules.
If they start to mine new blocks without having the network updated, their block will be rejected and not accepted on the exchanges.
So I think there will be some announcement, but with BU people you never know.

You go on some exchange and you buy your bitcoins (coinbase, kraken, localbitcoins, or another one that you like). When you buy your coins are in the exchange wallet. Then you send them to your electrum address that is generated in the tab "receive".
Once you have your coins on the electurm wallet you can send using the send tab. There you can specify the address of recipient and how much you want to send. There is also a selector for the fee that you want to use and based on it you can have your transfert faster or slower.

Yes fees, or even nothing. If miners stop to mine because it is no longer profitable, the difficulty will decrease and everyone could mine a new block with gpu, cpu or even a mobile phone.
So maybe the future wallets will include a miner program to calculate some hash and generate a new block.
The big power used by miners today is not a requirement of bitcoin network.

You cannot pretend that miners simply "accept". This idea worked when miners were amateurs investing their spare time in mining. Today miners spend big money to have farms and data centers and they wants to have a role in the decisional process of the rules.
Imamgine to be a miner that spend 10,000 $ in ASIC cards as long term investment and after couple of months one developer comes out with a modification of PoW. I don't want to say that it shouldn't be permitted, but if you do this you risk that miners continue to mine their own coin and make a war with you to kill your initiative. You also risk that nobody would mine on the new network because as soon as someone is a bit more committed, there is the risk of a change that destroy everything.
Changes are fine, but it is important to have a large approval by everyone, especially by who invested a lot in the project.

Bitcoin rely on nodes, the less nodes are available the less centralized is.
If you ever tried to setup one node you know how painful is already today, with blocks of 1MB, then to think about 8GB blocks is simply crazy.
The network would require a lot of power to run and only big datacenter would do it.
If you like the idea of few companies controlling the entire network and taking decisions for you, then you already have it, it is called bank.
I know that it is extremely ambitious to maintain bitcoins decentralized and distributed as it is today, but for me the road is to sit and solve the problems with compromises on technology but not about the idea of decentralized money.

The address you see is the public one, that everyone can see with your bitcoin balance but only who has the key can move them.

@_date: 2017-03-04 11:26:00
I really do not get your point.
The problem that you have to solve to obtain a new block in bitcoin blockchain is CPU intensive. People organise theirselves to have the strongest CPU they can. ASIC is the best to solve this problem. Miners don't care about openness of the platform, they want to mine bitcoins using the best thing that exists on the market.
To prevent this evolution the only option is that the complexity of the problem to solve is not CPU intensive, otherwise the hardware will always go in the direction of ASIC because are more efficient than GPUs for a single problem.
To change the problem to solve means to have a different blockchain and a different altcoin.
Write the altcoin that you like and start to mine it then.
You can do one that search a signature of ASIC and reject the blocks created with them (but probably the ASIC manufacturers will remove any signature that you can detect). You can do one where the complexity is in terms of memory and not CPU. This is up to your imagination and ability to write the code, but none of them will be a bitcoin because bitcoin is based on hashing and hashing is CPU intensive, so the best method for mining it is with ASIC.

Because they think that an hard fork should be done only if it is the only option to solve a problem. To change the block size is an hard fork.
I think that the current block size will not be sufficient and in the future we will have a block increase, so it is better to do it now along with segwit.
But Core doesn't want to discuss this point.

if the exchanges do not accept the old blocks the miners will not gain anything mining.

the two blockchain will be duplicated. So your coin will be in the same quantity on both chains as a copy.
Their value on the two chains will depend on what people will pay on the exchanges, but you will be able to trade your coins on the chain that you prefer.
Your cold wallet probably will be updated (the online client) to be able to spend coin on the old and the new chain.
Probably one chain will be more successful than the other and you can forget about the less profitable chain and continue to hodl on the successful one.
Long story short: hodl and wait patiently that the market fix this mess for you. (hopefully).
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:20:38
The question that you are asking is: what is a valid blockchain?
Let say that tomorrow all the miners change the rules and start to mine new blocks. The only chain is the one that they are growing up. All the nodes and the exchanges will reject them (because are not updated) but the chain is the one of the miners.
Then two things can happen: the nodes can adapt to the new rules and accept the blocks as valid or someone can start to mine with the old rules.
There is a fundamental point: what my personal node at home does is totally irrelevant. The only nodes important for the miners are the nodes of the exchanges. If their new rules are accepted in the exchanges, they can sell their coins and they are happy.
So the nodes are not all the same. The nodes of exchanges, used by wallets or by big shopping partners are the important for the miners. The other nodes are there just for the security of the person that runs it but not for the network. I use my node because I want to be sure that I am doing transactions on the blockchain and not on some scam server that steal my coins. But if my node dies nobody will notice.
So this is a two actors game: the miners that create the blocks following some rules and who trades the bitcoins accepting that rules. The importance of the two groups is ideally the same and if the environment is sane they should always agrees on rules.
In reality the situation is not exactly symmetric: the miners spend a lot of energy to mine bitcoins and their reward is only in bitcoins. So if they cannot sell them immediately they go bankrupted quickly (or they have to stop the mining hardware).
The exchanges can be people that have a trade business and, among other things, they trade bitcoins. If bitcoin drops in price or disappear, the problem is much bigger for miners than for exchanges.
From this point of view I think that miners should be listen a bit more when it is time to change the rules. Let's do an example: today miners calculate hashes and bought expensive equipments for this purpose. Tomorrow the community decide that we calculate new blocks with ice cream. The miners of today will go bankrupted and someone could say: who cares? The network will continue with ice cream manufacturer producing delicious blocks for us. But why someone should invest in ice cream mining if, after couple of years, the network can change their minds and decide to produce hamburger blocks?
People would stop to trust the network and someone may decide to stay with the old miners that produce traditional blocks.
Then I think that miners and nodes are both very important and every proposal of upgrade should be largely shared by everyone. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 23:33:39
well, from peers is perfectly fine. This can be a great improvement to setup a new node.
@_date: 2017-03-06 07:41:29
The computer I am using now is not exactly fast, but I installed a node also in an iMac Core i7 2.9GHz with 16GB of ram and fusion disk (ssd+regular disk) and it took more or less the same time.
This is why I end up with the idea that Bitcoin Core should provide a big tar (or couple of them) with the full blockchain pre-validated to simply download and start.
To be sure that the chain is ok it would be enough to hash the tar files and verify that are genuine.
This would allow to setup a new node in few hours, just the time of the download.

By the way, if segwit is implemented in an hard fork, it would be much more simple because it doesn't need to be backward compatible.

why 256 MB as maximum size? This would allow only 768 transactions per second. To reach the transactions of a debit card system we need at least 20,000 transactions per second. The limit should be then 8GB per block.
This mean 100 mbps of bandwidth always full just to receive the new blocks and 1TB used every day, this on every node.

Probably the Chines explained to him how big is the gain for miners once the fork is done.

This is inevitable for bitcoin, it is in its nature to follow the highest hash rate.

you may want to repeat Byzantine General Problem on other two or thee answers just to show off that you read the wiki page about it. Or you can try to listen and maybe learn something.
Today the miners can mine blocks of any size they want, simply these blocks are rejected by nodes because are not compliant with the rules of the network.
If tomorrow the network agrees to have a 2mb block size an hard fork is required because the size is a rule hardcoded in the protocol today.
This mechanism can be modified to have that the size of the block become a parameter and to change it in the future will not require an hard fork but only a change in the consensus.
Before you repeat Byzantine General Problem other twenty times I remember you that nothing today prevent a node to download the source of bitcoin, modify the 1mb limit and start to accept another size. So that user and a miner can agree on their consensus and work with a new size. What solves the Byzantine General Problem is not the way a limit is implemented but the consensus of the network.

This is an interesting argument but I think it doesn't apply well for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a scarce resource and if it goes mainstream the price can become hundred times bigger than today, so any large adoption will boast the price significantly. This means that today is probably very far from its possible "final" price and a discussion about cooling down is meaningless.

I think BU is a suicide for miners. But if they are tempted by something so stupid is because they feels a real problem and see no solution in the proposal of Core. That's why it should be discussed more.

The wallet does not have a relationship with traceability.
If you buy bitcoins with a bank transfert, it will be always traceable the bank transaction.
If you manage your bitcoins from home, your internet connection will be related to your bitcoin address.
If you want to be untraceable the steps are:
- buy, with cash, a computer that you will use to manage your wallet and nothing else (no browsing, email, socials or other);
- go to a public network (Starbucks, better if in another city), and install a wallet on the computer, like electrum, remember to write down the seed and later to put it in a safe place.
- generate a couple of receiving address and write them on paper;
- go to  find an ATM (possibly in another city than your) and buy with cash the bitcoins that you will transfert on the public addresses;
- when you want to use the bitcoins go to a public network and transfer them. Never sell them for money that you will receive on your bank account and never shop things on your home address.
This is the most anonymous procedure that I can think. For extra paranoia, electrum has an option to work on the Tor network, but if you are on a public network you probably do not need it.

the fee problem cannot be solved with SegWit or bigger block size.
The SegWit double the space and in a year we will be back to the current fees.
The hard fork proposal of BU removes the size limit, but the miners will try to mine always full blocks keeping the fees reasonably high to gain. On top of this, the block size will growth exponentially making the network unmanageable.
This is why Bitcoin Core propose to leave the block size as it is., because to change doesn't solve anything. Their long term solution is to have a second layer (the Lightening Network) to handle transactions fast. And this is allowed by the adoption of SegWit.
Bitcoin Core is proposing a roadmap for a long term solution, and it seems that many people don't see it but are entirely focused on the immediate problem.

The reason for the bitcoin network to have a new block is to store transactions. The reason for the miners to mine a new block is to gain the coins (and partially the fees, but it is a small amount compared to the reward).
So the need of the network is to store the highest number of transactions in a block in order to confirm them and not leave them pending. If the blocks are mined empty, the transactions will take longer time to be considered valid.

I do not understand the part against ETF. What was the idea of bitcoin? I use the title of Satoshi's paper "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".
The ultimate goal is to replace cash in a digital word. Cash is used to trade in the markets, to buy and sell things (even bad things like weapons), it is involved in every economical process of the society.

I really hope that the discussion will be open again after the failure of a fork (they will never reach an acceptable percentage of hash power) and after the failure of SegWit adoption (95% is impossible as well). Maybe SegWit and a block size increase is the way in the middle. After all even with SegWit and lightening network, a long term scaling will need a bigger block, then why not do it now?

I do not comment about the current limitations of bitcoin network, but I find over exaggerated to call bitcoin a failure.
It is the first time of a p2p payment method without a king or government to bless it and it proved that it is possible to disconnect the money from the governments.
I cannot imagine how a digital money could have a bigger success as experiment.
Now that we know that it is doable we have to transform it in something more reliable and less proof-of-concept.
What people forget is that the initial idea of Satoshi wasn't to trade fiat for bitcoin but was to solve the problem of double spending with a digital currency.
I strongly believe that in the future we will use a decentralized digital currency and, no matter which one will be, its story started with bitcoins.

It is correct that a block has a limited amount of space for transactions (1MB), but in 1 MB you can put around 1800 transactions, not 3. The number 3 that you have is the number of transactions per second that can stay in the blockchain. This is easy to calculate. The time to generate a new block is around 10 minutes, so 600 seconds. In 600 seconds (1 block) you can pack 1800 transactions. In average are 3 transactions per second (1800/600=3). In reality you have 1800 transaction altogether every 10 minutes in a block (if the block is full).

It is a weird behaviour from many point of view.
First of all to change all your saving in bitcoin hoping for a decision that the bookmakers gives with 30% of probability is very dangerous.
Second, to use a paper wallet for short time trading is meaningless. The probability to have your money stolen from your computer (or even from an exchange) is quite low, so why not to leave directly on the exchange if you want to sell them in a week?
Third, if ETF will be approved this will be the first step in a bigger world and the immediate increase of bitcoin value will be the first of many (IMO). So why selling immediately?
Anyway the money is your and your decision is always the best you can take for yourself. Nobody else can argue on it. My comments are just because you are asking.
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:35:54
Because the block size is not the real problem.
With the current size (1MB) the number of transactions per second are 3 in average. The long term goal should be to have a network that can replace the credit card network that is 24,000 per second. So the size in the blocks should reach 8GB per block and this is impossible to manage on a normal computer. The outcome is that the only people capable to manage a node are big companies with large investments (this sounds like a new bank network).
To avoid this the side chains like lightening network are the solutions.
This is why any hard fork is meaningless for the solution of the block size in the long term. SegWit is not for block size (that is a side effect) but it is much more to solve several other issues of the blockchain that are well explained here:
Your solution has also another problem: the miners want to have bigger blocks to have more fees, so they would start to mine blocks always 90% full in order to have bigger and bigger blocks.
For a while this will be limited by the number of bitcoin transactions, but this number is increasing exponentially and quickly the blocks will be gigantic killing all the normal nodes.
If the block size is a problem, why we do not start with SegWit today (solving also the other issues) wait until the blocks are full again and do an hard fork in one year or two?
The reality is that who proposes hard fork and bigger blocks doesn't think that bitcoin will be a true replacement of traditional currencies but wants to gain the maximum now from this idea and let it die once it will not be anymore profitable.
Luckily the miners do not know what to do right now: someone wants to gain everything now and someone else sees the possibility to do dozen of millions if waits the natural growth of the network. This is why many of them didn't enter yet in the discussion about block size.

We do not tolerate anything, it is the market that decide.
If we find a way to "restart" with GPUs, there will be someone buying hundreds of them to become rich. Then someone else will think to use something faster than a GPU like an ASIC and will start to use it to mine more and make more money.
Finally people will discover that those devices are using a lot of power and are profitable only in countries with cheap power bill. The ASIC farms will start to born in China, India, etc. and we will end in the same situation of today.
It is like to ask: why we tolerate that everything is made in China today? Because if you do in US or Europe you have to pay the final product triple.

then why not fork for blocks with customizable size (but locked for the moment) plus segwit? Segwit has a complex implementation to be backward compatible.

Well. As many times said here, if you do not own the private key, you do not own the bitcoin. If you leave your bitcoins in the hands of an exchange it can be that the exchange will decide for you what to do.
I think it is very unlucky that they will take any action, but you cannot be sure. So my suggestion is to keep them on a wallet that you control.
You can do a perfectly safe cold storage with electrum and an old computer that you do not connect to the Internet.

Boy, before saying to someone that doesn't understand you should be sure.
First: I was solving differential equations while you were shitting your diapers, so don't pretend to teach me math.
Second: I know perfectly that it is the 44% of the signaling people, but this increased of 5%  in one day while the total miners didn't change in one day, so it is a significative increase with respect to the total.
Third: the trend of signaling is clear and totally in favor of BU with a SegWit stable to 25% since long time.
Because all of this, I am worried that the fork will happen and it will happen soon. You think you are a cool guy yawning at it? Sure, you are cool like the musicians on Titanic.

Today the large majority of the transactions are on-chain, are rare cases the one off-chain. With Lightening Network the off chains will be the rule and only 1 over 10,000 will be in the block chain.
The miners will try to stop this in any mode as they are already doing now. Otherwise why they do not signal for SegWit now?
@_date: 2017-03-22 20:41:37
In a word where nobody pay fees it is perfectly fine if the miners are rewarded by blocks. Once the reward it will no longer profitable, the miners will leave the business and the difficulty will decrease.

SegWit is backward compatible, so if doesn't work miners can continue to mine blocks with normal transitions or they can do an hard fork later. SegWit has no drawback, this is why it should  be done now. There is no reason to be against SegWit, because it solves many other issues of bitcoin blockchain and it allows the possibility of an hard fork for those issues not addressed. This is the prove that BU team doesn't care about the stability of the network but has only the desire of power. They will fail miserably after their fork. The sooner the better, so we finally can growth the bitcoin.

Miners are today all mining blocks according to the current rules of bitcoin. In the block there is a space that can host a short message, they are using that one to say "SegWit" or "BU" (I am oversimplifying, but this is the idea).
Here you can see the actual messages in every block: 
The space used to write the message is called Coin Base Text. If it contains "SEGWIT" is for SegWit, if it is contains "EB1/AD6" is for Bitcoin Unlimited proposal.
This is just a tag used to express a wish, not a modification in the block structure.

I try to explain in an easy way. Forget about LN for a second and think about this situation.
Let say you sell coffe and I am your customer. We want to use bitcoin but we do not want to write every coffe on the blockchain, but only the total every month. Can we do it?
We start like this: I do a tx for you with what I think is the total of coffes (like $50). If I just do this tx, you can have my money and not give me the coffes, so I need some way to be sure that you will not cheat. The idea is that you give me a tx signed by you that uses my tx as input with the full amount ($50) directed to me.
I keep this tx in my computer but I do not broadcast it, I keep just in case you will not give me the coffe. If I broadcast it I will have my money back.
Now I pay the first coffe. When I pay it, I have to give you a tx that is connected to my tx where I say that I give you the cost of the coffe. You do not broadcast it, you simply keep that tx as insurance for the payment of the coffe.
We continue like this until the end of the month, exchanging txs with the balance that we finally want. Of course we can simply agree that we collect all of them in one single tx that contains the "change" at the end of the month where I receive back my change and we are ok.
This is an ultra-semplification of LN. Now about SegWit.
Bitcoin had a bug. When you prepare a tx that is "connected" to another tx, you are not sure that you are really connected to the correct tx. It existed a way to modify the connection breaking it. In practice you could have prepare the refund tx to send to me that is connected to an empty wallet, so I pay for the coffees with the initial tx, you don't give me the coffees and when I try to use your signed tx to have my money back I discover that the tx you gave me is broken. The possibility to modify the connection between two txs is called malleability.
SegWit fixed this problem so today I am totally sure that the refund tx that I have in my hand as warranty that you will give me the coffe is connected to my original tx and will work if I need it.

I am more confused than ever. I understood in the first place that SegWit was a useful way to decrease fees.

The current block size is a problem because there are too many transactions to fit in 1MB space. So there are several solutions: free space moving part of the transactions our of the block; use another chain to store "temporary" transaction in order to reduce the number of on-chain transaction or increasing the blocksize.
The last option is the simplest to think but it is not the best (IMO) because it is not affordable in the long term. The miners like it because more transactions in the block means more fees to gain.

maybe you are right and it is not possible to implement it easily, but it is the only way to punish the "cheating" miners.
Look at what is happening today: it was discovered that Bitmain diverted the attention from its ASICBoot issue with SegWit opening a debate about scalability while its only problem was to keep secret their code. And now that the cheat was exposed, and it is clear that the hard fork will not happen anytime soon, the price of bitcoin increased with a large benefit for all the miners, the one that cheated and the others that are doing a great job for the community.
We should have a way to "fire" or at least punish the miners for their behaviour.

@_date: 2017-04-07 15:04:28
This specific case could be solved with the soft fork, but also this has to be approved by the miners and anyway this doesn't work for any situation where a cheating is discovered.

It doesn't sound a perfect solution for scaling, but its main value is that someone is starting to think about scaling without touching the current blockchain.

It is not like localbitcoins. In localbitcoins the coins stay on a wallet that is owned by localbitcoins, here they create a multisig transaction.

Can someone help me to understand this? I thought that Core wanted the adoption of SegWit to reduce the fees. I installed the latest Electrum and transferred everything on bech32 addresses, but now I discovered that no exchange supports this standard and Lukejr says not to use SegWit.
I am a bit confused.
@_date: 2017-04-22 08:43:35
I prefer to see this in an optimistic way. This was the last step of a long decisional process. The miners are the most difficult to convince and wanted to do this meeting among theirselves. I say this because without a strong voice from the community in favor of SegWit and without the possibility of UASF, I do not think that even this meeting would happen.
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:00:52
I like that this post had so many comments because it means that there is still room for discussion in the scaling debate.
My point is that we need a pragmatic approach: the miners are blocking all the possible upgrades and it is frustrating to continue to propose solutions that will not be implemented. UASF is of course a possibility (that I think is dangerous as an Hard Fork, or even more). So, in the meanwhile, why not asking them what they want. What is a proposal that 95% of them would enforce? Maybe starting from this we can work on something real and end this fight that is damaging everyone.
@_date: 2017-04-11 21:54:44
to avoid fake information you need that the information require a certain effort to be produced. That's exactly the idea of Satoshi PoW. But the network finds its own ways to solve problems and today miners are producing a problem with their irresponsible behavior. This doesn't mean that the solution is good, but without an alternative the miners will continue their battle forever. Maybe the idea of a UASF will motivate them to solve their conflicts (I doubt, but who knows...).
@_date: 2017-04-24 20:23:43
No. The user that sells sign a transaction with his key before receiving the money. His bitcoins will be awaiting for the key of the escrow that is the only one that can decide what to do from that moment on.
After the seller signed his part of transaction he has to wait for the money. Once the money is received he has just to tell to the escrow that he received the money. If he disappear the bitcoins are anyway locked so from the point of view of the seller he lost them.
If he disappear with the money the buyer can show to the escrow the prove of the payment and the escrow will decide to release the bitcoin.
By the way, today is exactly the same, the only difference is that the bitcoins are on a wallet of the escrow, in the case of Hodlhodl the bitcoins are locked with the key of the escrow.
@_date: 2017-04-24 21:00:43
Yes, but this risk is smaller compared to an exchange that decides to close everything and disappear with cash and coins.

Yes, because if they do not agree about a change in the rules the rule will not be adopted. So it is a problem.
@_date: 2017-04-12 09:16:10
It doesn't work like that. It has to be 75% of all the blocks mined during the signalling period (2 weeks). So we have to wait two weeks of stable signalling to have it activated.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:32:30
We can continue to repeat this story forever or realize that this is not the reality. The reality is that the rules are enforced by miners, so we need a common strategy to improve the network.
@_date: 2017-04-04 15:00:57
It is even closer. Right now only four pools are not signaling and they have in total 28.2% of the hash power. This mean that they are at 71.8%.
This site  analyze the last 500 blocks and based on them it is 68.6%, but Batpool started to signal during the night, so the first half of the blocks is still without their signaling.
It is enough that one of the missing pools start to signal to activate SegWit.
@_date: 2017-04-02 18:07:13
they are taking a position and are doing it in the most rational way. They activated SegWit first on Syscoin, then they started to signal SegWit on Litecoin. Once activated there they will probably start to signal on Bitcoin.
In this roadmap they are finding that the transition is not perfectly smooth, so its current work is of great value to test SegWit on other networks.
@_date: 2017-04-14 07:08:55
UASF is extremely dangerous because it can be manipulated effortless.
Someone that wants to signal thousand times can simply install thousand server ans signal, modifying the balance of the vote.
That's why the PoW is a secure method for voting.

The mediation is done using multisignature transactions.
You send a bitcoin to me and the site sign together so I cannot access those bitcoins until the site release them. Once I see that I received the bitcoin and I pay you cash, we both notify the site that the transaction is over and the site will release my bitcoin with its signature.
@_date: 2017-04-24 16:38:40

@_date: 2017-04-24 19:54:00
Why the other party should send you the fiat payment before receiving the notification from the escrow that you sent the bitcoin?
You first have to open the bitcoin transaction together with the signature of the escrow. Once this is done the other person will be notified that there are bitcoins waiting for the payment. When the payment is finalized the coins are released by the escrow.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:39:31
No, it is called the Nakamoto's Consensus and it is the reason why all the upgrades of bitcoin are stuck right now, because we do not have that consensus.
To have a group of people agreeing on something is not a cartel. It is a cartel when there is no more competition between the suppliers. The miners compete in the block generations not in the rules of the network. Those rules must be the same for everyone.

I can understand the feeling, I thing everyone in the bitcoin community is frustrated by this discussion. We all want to move on from this scaling debate and return to focus on bitcoin as a resource, not as a problem.
Unfortunately, as in any conflict, there isn't communications between the different sides and we will be stuck for long time if a miracle doesn't happen.
@_date: 2017-04-13 18:59:45
So it is a pure coincidence that the upgrades of the network are blocked since two years. Cannot be because of the miners, they are there only to order transactions and prevent double spending.

Sure, why not? You have a code that is unfinished for a service that is not yet ready and what you do? Clearly you put in production. Best practice from any book of coding.
More than this, from what do you start in writing a remote control feature for your cards? From the user authentication? No. From the encryption of the communication? No. From the possibility to switch off the device with an hard coded parameter? Yep!

Activated by who? By the nodes. Let's say that the 1st of August only my node activates SegWit, so who cares? Let's say that 3 or 10% of the nodes activates, who cares? If 50% activates is a problem, we would have a split network not too different form an hard fork. If 95% of the nodes activates SegWit the transition will be smooth enough.
Clearly it is a vote where the size of who is onboard matters.

@_date: 2017-04-21 09:36:06
and why not? Have you ever wonder why we should pay for transactions? There isn't any real reason. Miners have the reward and when it will go to zero they will stop mining. The difficulty will decrease and everyone can become miner with its own node, as it was in the past. We could even change the PoW to avoid ASIC attacks and have a real decentraliEd network with no fees.
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:51:08
If it is used only as intermediate step its value shouldn't increase.
The rapid development of other altcoins is because the ecosystem is very limited. Already for Litecoin there was an upgrade discussion similar to the one of Bitcoin, for a crypto that doesn't need any scaling system right now (the Litecoin blocks are empty).
To summarize, this post is FUD.
@_date: 2017-04-11 21:32:37
I agree with you that PoW should be the way to enforce the rules because is the secure way. But we cannot ignore the fact that a UASF is possible even if not desirable way to change the rules. The miners should wonder why the community is asking a dangerous method to change the rules instead of using the best method.
Unfortunately it seems that the miners are too busy pursuing a stupid war to see that the community is exhausted and wants to stop it in any possible way and UASF is a possible way.
UASF is activated by the nodes but the responsibility is of the miners.
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:07:23
I Probably wasn't clear.
You are A, I am B and Hodlhodl is S.
Usually to send bitcoins from A to B it is requested only the signature of A. In a multisig transaction you can require two or more signatures. So A originate the transaction that, to be finalized, must bi signed by S.
S will ask to B: "did you pay", and B answer "yes". S will ask to A "did you receive the money?" and A say "yes". Then S sign the transaction and B receive the bitcoins.
Now this os exactly how any escrow service works, with the difference that the coins will never stay on a website wallet, but the escrow is done through the third signature.
That means you do not have to load money on a bank account of the website, you do not have to pay the fees for an extra transaction from the site to your wallet.
The problems of scam are the same on any other escrow like localbitcoins.
@_date: 2017-04-20 14:55:52

@_date: 2017-04-07 12:13:04
The reason is that the feature is illegal in all the countries that recognize the patent of Timo Hanke and Sergio Demian Lerner. So they do not enable it by default but who wants can use the "pirate" feature.
If it was discovered they can always say that the feature is there but not enabled to comply with the patents.

I give you an example.
You will get the coffe in the same Starbucks every day. In theory you should do a transaction every day on the block chain. With Lightening Network you will have a transaction only between you and your Starbucks for the month. At the end of the month the final balance between you and vendor will go to the Blockchain. You saved 30 transactions on the blockchain.
More than this: Starbucks has to move a lot of money with their suppliers, so they can register on LN a lot of transaction and write on the blockchain only few of them.

The 95% signalling was not implemented by Core, it is the implementation of the Nakamoto consensus. Only who enforces the Proof-of-Work can implement the consensus. This is due to the fact that the PoW is difficult to manipulate while the nodes can be produced effortless and everyone can install hundreds of them.
@_date: 2017-04-04 08:36:25
He is right, but the alternative to the current SegWit proposal of Core is... nothing.
We will never have 95% because Antpool is too big and they will not signal for SegWit. So new proposals should be evaluated, even if not optimal.
@_date: 2017-04-21 09:25:46
the first I can think is that shouldn't be the miners to select the new blocksize. The size is not a reward mechanism but is the space to collect transactions, so it should always stay small. The block size should be a function of the average mempool size. If there are too many transactions waiting, then the block size increases, otherwise stay constant or even decreases.
@_date: 2017-04-24 18:51:16
not sure I understand the case. You want to buy bitcoins, you pay for them and you don't log in the site anymore?
I guess that if the seller is satisfied with the payment the escrow can release the bitcoin anyway. The buyer will receive it on his wallet.
What is the problem?

The satellite is more marketing than a real thing.
\- The satellite broadcasts only the last blocks, not the full blockchain, so you need a pre-synced blockchain anyway to have a full node;
\- The satellite is not owned by Blockstream but they buy the connection from companies that can shutdown the connection easily if there is an order of some government;
\- To send a tx you need anyway an Internet connection because the satellite does not accept them. Now they are enabling some "messaging" but it is not clear what you will be able to do with such messages, but it does not seems possible to broadcast a tx.
I would really like to read the usage statistics of the satellite because I think that nobody is using for real.

If SegWit is activated as soft fork, ASICBoost will stop to work automatically because it needs a different header. So there is no need of a specific BIP for it. And if Jihan find a way to re-enable it, good for him.
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:58:22
Yes I am ok with that. It is the natural competition of the free market. And, by the way, who is using an ASIC today is 10000% more efficient than Satoshi mining with his PC in 2009. And the mining is way more centralized than at the time of GPUs.

there is no rule in bitcoin about how to mine. The only rule is to calculate sha-256, the way is up to the fantasy of the miner.
Than why do not forbid the ASIC? It centralize the mining.
Why we do not forbid the pools? It centralize the mining.
Why we do not forbid to mine where the electricity is less expensive? It centralize the mining!
By the way, nobody is against ASICBoost in Core, only the covert version because it is the reason why Jihan is against SegWit.
This is the only problem for me and we should simply don't care about Jihan and activate SegWit.
But a BIP to disable on purpose a feature of a miner is unreasonable for me.
@_date: 2017-05-14 11:33:05
Your believe is wrong because what is blocking SegWit is that it conflicts with ASICBoost of Bitmain.
There isn't any real scaling debate right now, it is just a group that wants to make Bitcoin better versus a group (or a person) that has no interest in Bitcoin but only in its own hardware.

I think that Bitcoin will find its solution.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:17:29
no, ignore it and activate segwit. But there is no point in discussing a specific BIP to disable it.
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:46:00
so if ASICBoost is allowed (as it should be for me) and the only problem is that the covert implementation mess up with the header of the block, we do not need any specific BIP for it. We need just to activate SegWit and if this breaks the covert ASICBoost is a problem of Jihan.
The fact that he is against SegWit because this will happen is irrelevant. He could have millions of motivations to be against SegWit and still we need to activate it. To focus the attention on ASICBoost for me is wrong because it is simply one of the many reasons that a miner can have to stop SegWit. The real problem is to find a way to activate it (BIP 148 for example) not to stop ASICBoost.

@_date: 2017-05-05 19:30:54
Ok, some calculation for you.
The current hash power in Bitcoin is around 4,000,000 TH/s.
A block is created every 10 minutes (600 seconds) with that hash power, it means that you have to calculate 4,000,000*600 = 2,400,000,000 TH for one block.
The best device you can buy today for mining is the Antmine S9 that mines 14 TH per second, it means that with that device you need 2,400,000,000/14 = 171,428,572 seconds = 5.4 years.
To resume: you have to run an Antimine S9 24h/7 for 5.4 years in order to mine a block and gain 12.5 bitcoins and earn 12.5*1520$ = 19,000$
How much do you spend in these 5.4 years? The first cost is the Antminer S9 that is 1,269$. The second cost is the power. The device, when runs at full power, absorbs 1.375 kW and in the 5.4 years it runs for 47,619 hours, it means that you need 1.375*47,619 = 65,476 kWh.
Google tells me that the electricity in USA costs around 0.12$ per kWh so the power to mine one block costs 65,476 * 0.12 = 7,857 $.
Summarizing: to mine one block you need to spend 1,269$ (only once) + 7,857$ (of power) = 9,126$ as minimum base. Then you have to pay the datacenter, the cooling, someone to keep the infrastructure running and the taxes on the gain. I am not sure how to quantify this in USA, but you can probably figure it out.
The reward for one block is 19,000$, so you have a certain margin but I guess you will not gain a lot in the end.
Of course you can buy two, three, hundred Antminer S9, but everything scales together. So you will multiply the expenses and the gains in the same way.
Last consideration: the bitcoin reward halves every 210,000 blocks and the next halving will happen the 24 Jun 2020. So after that date the reward will no longer be 12.5 per block but 6.2 per block. At the same time it is possible that one bitcoin will value much more than today, this is difficult to predict.
I hope this calculation is useful for you to have a better idea of your future business.

If you will ever try to do a data analysis in your life, you will learn that it is can start with insufficient data and several reasonable guesses.
Then, when the dataset increases, you can refine or disprove your model.
This is a standard practice in many fields.
Here there are several guesses but non unreasonable. Your criticism that you don't know how many real users and how they use the wallets can be solved thinking that there is a simple scaling factor between the real and fake users.
If this is true, the exponential growth stay unaffected.
This assumption is not random but is based on what you can see for any other internet service. The more you have total users, the more will be the number of real users, always with a linear scaling factor.
But I repeat, this is simply my model. I wait for your. If you don't have one I use the old rule of data analysis: a poor model is better than no model.

That plot tells you that the number of people interested in bitcoin doubled every year. So the function that express the blockchain.info trend is in the for of 2^t where t is the time expressed in years.
If you fit the bitcoin data, you find that the best fit for the last to years goes with the function 2.38^t (you can find my plots here: 
This is the same function that you can find if you search in the google trends, or looking at the download rate of the major wallets.
The doubling function occurs everywhere and in statistics it is the signature of a word-of-mouth adoption.

The UASF is an activation date for SegWit, and SegWit is backward compatible because it is a soft fork.
So if people won't enforce it, the chain will not split, simply some miner will mine blocks that include SegWit transactions and other will mine the current blocks. The risk is that the miners that do not like SegWit will start soon to mine empty blocks because the users will start to use SegWit transactions.
This is a problem but not so big because the blocks with SegWit can have a capacity that is double with respect to the current blocks, so if 40% of the mining power mines empty blocks we still are gaining in efficiency.
More than this, LN can be activated and reduce even more the load, at that point the blocks will be empty enough that the "riots" miners will no longer be important.

the less known is the crypto the higher is the risk in investing in it.
I do not know the exact calculations for different cryptos, they uses different algorithms fir the PoW.
My suggestion is, before spending any money, to have the calculations that I showed you very clear in mind for the crypto that you like.
Finally, if I were your boss, I would not invest  in mining hardware that you have to maintain, replace periodically etc., but in cryptos directly diversifying in the first five.
The overall gain is much more, I think.

I am simply finding a trend in all the data about Bitcoin. Then, if every trend are fake and only what you think is correct, this is another story and it is surely possible. I tend to believe that if there are millions of wallets and millions of searches to google the number of users is around... millions, not ten with a lot of time to waste.
Because, as you said, better data are not available, I try to identify a possible correlation with the information that I have doing some assumption, like a linear correlation between total number of wallets and active number of users. This is the case for every Internet service, but again maybe Bitcoin is an exception and you have better data. Ah, by the way, considering that you don't like my poor analysis, what are your data?

for me Jihan can use any technique to calculate the SHA-256, even methods that are patented by other people that will sue him. This is his problem and nobody in the Bitcoin network cares. The problem is that to hide his shit he manipulate the block header preventing the upgrade and pushing for another idiotic solution just not to loose his cheating code.
Frankly I really hope he will continue with this way until the network will punish him.

Everyone can invent a super cool coin even superior as technology than bitcoin, but its value will be related to the number of shops that the housewife will be able to spend it.

Bitcoin has to go mainstream if we want to complete the revolution, and this mean that has to exit from the "circle of bitcoiners" and reach the housewife.

"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"
"Bitcoin: A Store of Value".
I think this idea of the store of value is completely wrong.
Bitcoin is to replace the bank, to receive the salary in bitcoin and spend it to pay bills, coffe, cars, houses without depending on a bank.
It is not a sort of digital Fort Knox where to store a digital gold.

Well, yes and no. The main difference is that your bitcoin do not sit on the wallet of the escrow like in Localbitcoins but are always in your wallet. The escrow function is provided by multi signature transactions.
The similar functionality is that the cash payment is p2p and do not pass by the exchange.
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:40:04
answer to yourself these two questions:
- what is the value of gold?
- what is the value of VISA (or PayPal)?
Then you have your answer: Bitcoin is a storage of value as gold with the flexibility to spend it as PayPal (actually we have to fix a bit of things to arrive there but the concept is there).
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:29:17
where is it written that the miners must to explain how do they mine?
The problem is the stop of the upgrade, not ASICBoost. We should upgrade to SegWit and if this is a problem for Jihan who cares?
But a BIP on purpose to disable a technology is a nonsense. Then we should disable who mine with ASIC because is too powerful compared with GPUs. And ASIC is at the root of all the mining problems because it centralized the vote in few hands, but this is how btc evolved and I do not see people invoking a BIP to disable ASICs.
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:53:19
if segwit is activated without bit4 no because the client of segwit2x doesn't see the activation of segwit and doesn't lock-in the fork.

I am not claiming he is doing anything. I am saying that covert asicboost is in conflict with segwit and he prefer to have asicboost available than to upgrade the network with segwit.
If he is using today or tomorrow is not an issue, he can do whatever he wants. The problem is when his technology interferes with bitcoin's development.

he can keep it silent and then use in case of hard fork to boost the hash power to kill the other chain. Like the switch to turn off the miners that he doesn't like. There are many method to use a technology advantage.
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:14:56
The code for the fork is written only in the segwit2x client, not in the core client. If the bit4 of the segwit2x client doesn't reach 80% of hash power, for the client segwit is not active and the hard fork is not locked-in.
In this scenario is still possible that segwit is activatied via UASF with, for example, 50% of the hash power and still the hard fork on the segwit2x client will not happen because the client doesn't know that segwit was activated on the core-uasf clients.
The case where BIP148 will trigger the activation of the fork is only if segwit2x is not signaled on bit4 but the miners will signal 95% of BIP141, because this will trigger the activation of segwit also on the segwit2x clients. I see this scenario as practically impossible. If 95% of the current miners will signal for segwit is because they will also signal for segwit2x. If the 95% is realized through uasf is because the nodes start to invalidate blocks non segwit and the miners against segwit probably will split way before the activation of the fork of segwit2x.
Ah, by the way, I do not care who say what because I am perfectly able to read the code, so even if God say the opposite, this doesn't change the reality because this is what is written in the code released on git, that is my only source of information.
