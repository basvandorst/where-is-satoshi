Earlier today I was sitting there thinking about switching my node over to *[censored]* even though my approach has been to wait and see what becomes of the ongoing debate. Before I did that I decided to go check out and I see a new post to a essay about *[censored]*. I thought it was very ironic, and also grabbed the popcorn because I figured a full blown shitstorm on here was about to take place. I was not disappointed. The amount of censorship taking place for anyone discussing *[censored]* was what pushed me to finally switch my node. Our voices have to be heard.

Your transaction is fine: 
blockchain.info is broken, don't trust it. As for why it's taking so long to go through, there is a massive "stress test" that has been underway for a few days now. That has resulted in there currently being about 50,000 transactions backlogged and waiting to make it into a block. A bigger fee would have helped speed that up, but it will still go through eventually, it may just take a while so don't panic.

This is great news! I order vaping gear (aka e-cigarette) from them all the time, and sometimes other random stuff like cables and crap. I have long wished that they would accept bitcoin and now they do!

Nicely done!

No need to hike transaction fees if it was to take over as a major world wide payment system. At the point you may have 30,000 transactions every second, so even at a rate of about $0.01 per transaction that is $300 per second in fees, or $180,000 worth for every 10 minute block mined. That's a lot more than has ever been made from just the block rewards. Of course, the current scalability problem has to be solved before we could ever get anywhere near that high of transaction volume.

I don't think any store is going to trust people to scan items as they walk around and pull them off the shelf. We have self checkouts, but it's done at the register where the store can monitor that people are actually scanning all their items. Integrating bitcoin as a payment option into the self checkout registers is all that's needed to do this very thing.

Coinbase would be my recommendation.

It's things like this that make the general public go from laughing at us and our "magic internet money", to seeing how useful and how much better it is. The Paypal stuff of "send $1.40 to donate $1" and "account is frozen" is especially hilarious because it's so cliche.
