China just builds toilets and moves before anyone can use them as a way of using borrowed money and construction to give money to the lower class to keep their economy awesome.
And here I am in the US, legally using a toilet with no job.

Did they fix it though? When I got my rig from them they sent me a fan replacement free priority mail and walked me through fixing it, and they where prompt and friendly. I would buy from them again if I was still into mining. Now I'm into being retired, farming for fun, and hanging out with my dogs. This is partially because of the stint of mining I did.

I have no idea what is going on here but wouldn't this guy be more convincing if he sued the person that the contract was with, the Notre Republic, and anyone signed as a witness?

because it is super hot in august, making it harder for over-heated servers to produce bitcoins, increaseing their rarity.

they already got becking from venture capitalists and said that it may be up to two months late shipping units ordered now. sounds like they could use more funding but I doubt they are using pre-ordered funds. I'd like to see if someone could get the number on the account that their money is being escrowed in.

I'm not on this sub a lot anymore, but I did bet my life savings on bitcoin for months at a time a few years ago. I know what bitcoins are, how they work, and how to use them. I champion them, and still use them,and I'm a hodler, and love that things are getting more and more user friendly and understandable. This is what is going to make Bitcoin bloom.
I know what a paper wallet is, and the analogy is simple to understand. I can explain a paper wallet to my mum. There is nothing wrong with paper. The money I use is on paper. I do not know what "Paper ECDSA private keys" are, but I do know that it sounds "techie" enough that it would upset my mum. 
Warren Buffet says never put what you value into something you could not explain easily to a five year old. Use the two different phrases in front of a five year old and I guarantee two different reactions, only one being comprehension.

Porn has pushed technological innovation forever. The internet was built on porn, photography was developed (no pun intended) by a desire for black market pornography. Humans have priorities. Most things are developed for sex or war. I hope that bitcoins are never used for war, and I am excited that Kink.com may take my bitcoins in the future.

You do understand that holding stock in Satoshi Dice and playing it are diffrent things right? This person is on the right side of that 2% house edge.

It is smug, self-righteous and threatening to say that you have a personal army and that at your command they will humiliate someone who does not agree with them. And if you don't agree with me me and my 46,839 member personal army will downvote you into oblivion, and you will wallow in your shame.

zimbabwe just declared bitcoin their offical currancy, so settle down. Some new people might get around to using it.
