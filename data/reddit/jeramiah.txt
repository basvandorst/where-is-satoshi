At first glance is seems that the government is an insurmountable foe, and the odds are overwhelmingly against a revolutionary force. Tanks, missiles, chemical weapons, bombs, nukes and all that.
This is just ignorance.
Modern warfare (termed Fourth Generation warfare) is characterized by low intensity guerrilla conflict with a focus on insurgency coupled with strategic strikes against high value targets and control of public media (hearts and minds).
Keeping that in mind let's take a look at the realities of a modern US revolution.
Best estimates put the sum of our armed forces at about 2.1 million people. That's everybody from the high speed low drag operators down to the janitors and cooks. Reserves included.
Federal and State law enforcement totals about 800,000 sworn LEOs. We'll be generous and say a combined total of 3 million give or take 100,000 (remember some of those people are cross over and are counted in both categories).
So assuming that every single one of them would side with the government (which is a laughable assumption in the first place) that is a fighting force of about 3 million.
In 2012 Wisconsin issues over 600,000 hunting permits. Now some of those will cross with the "government" side, but let's just say half are neither LEO or military. That's 300,000 people who have experience in precision shooting, stalking, tracking, and use of camouflage. From one state.
It's estimated that there are about 100 million gun owners in the US (I'd say the number is actually much higher, but we'll use that as the number of non LEO/military gun owners as it makes things simple for the purposes of this discussion.
During the American Revolution (the one against England) it is well accepted that approximately 55% of people supported the revolutionaries, while ~25% provided material support in some way (food, shelter), about 10% provided supplies (weapons, etc.) and intel, and about 3% of the colonists did the actual fighting.
If we can assume those numbers would be consistent today, the revolutionaries could field a fighting force of about 3 million people. So just at basic clean black and white assumptions we have an equal number of combatants.
Now anyone that actually knows people in the military and law enforcement knows that not all of them are going to side with the government in a situation like this. In my opinion, if ordered to take up arms against their own people, better than half of them will refuse or desert. Many of them taking their equipment, training, and experience directly to the revolutionaries, including tanks, APCs, machine guns, rockets, and so on.
Now we come to missiles, bombs, bio/chem/nukes.
No one is going to use them. First, any commander ordering their use on American soil is more likely to be shot by their own men than to have that order carried out. That's just the facts. But for arguments sake let's say that someone was able to order a strike with a WMD on the revolutionary forces.
Can you imagine how that would swell the ranks of the other side? Pretty much anyone on the fence at all (and probably a large portion of their supporters) would instantly align with the revolutionaries.
So WMDs are pretty much right off the table.
We're left with about even man to man odds in these assumptions and all of the assumption have erred in favor of the government here.
That's 3 million revolutionaries hiding in a population of 300 million, no uniforms, a disjointed command infrastructure with cells operating independently and any given person apt to take independent yet copacetic action with the revolution at any time.
Against a force that almost exclusively wears uniforms and operates on rules of engagement that preclude mass bystander casualties (because it'll be a PR war as much as anything).
Oh, and that tricky Fourth Generation warfare thing.
It doesn't need to be a decided victory by man to man body count.
You could change the face of the country overnight by killing or capturing just 111 people.

3 million against 111. It's bad odds. Pretty much an unwinnable nightmare scenario.
That aside it won't go down overnight. Armed conflict in this country? At least six months of hell on earth. Can you imagine what this country would look like after a couple of months of cops refusing to respond to any calls? That's exactly what will happen once a few dozen or hundred of them get wiped out in fake 911 call ambushes.
It'll be chaos. Gangs won't be sitting still, somebody is gonna figure out that say "Warlord of Detroit" is a hell of a title upgrade from Gang Leader. Not to mention the Mexican drug cartels (who are here and operating throughout this entire country. Do not let the media blackout on it fool you for a second).
You think your average person who decides to sit the main fight out is gonna just sit there while it happens? What do you think day to day life is gonna look like in this country for your average person?
Revolution would pretty much turn this country into a third world shithole overnight.
Now I'm just one guy. Who has put just a tiny bit of thought into how it might actually go down.
I'm just sayin, it's scary how easily it could happen.
The only question is what would be a big enough spark to ignite that uncontrollable blaze?
I dunno. I'm pretty sure repeal or destruction of the Second Amendment would do it.

Why on earth would you sell?
@_date: 2013-08-26 00:06:07
Gold does not have little inherent value. The computer or phone you are using to read this contains gold. As with most precious metals they do have great value, just not as decorations. 
@_date: 2013-08-25 22:12:24
Each are not finite. Gold is only scarce where we can currently reach it. There is more gold in the asteroid belt than we have mined in the entire history of the world. When we can reach out and capture that the value of gold and all other precious metals will plummet. where as bitcoin is forever limited. 
@_date: 2013-08-26 03:20:01
Diamonds are a special case. In some ways they did lose their value. The man made diamonds are now used for industrial and tech applications. The only reason they did not lose all value is because of the massive hoarding by the diamond companies such as De Beers. Filtering the ocean for gold particles is certianly an option. However asteroids contain many other minerals than gold which are even more rare on earth. The rare earth metals such as iridium are only found on eath because of meteorite impacts. If we started mining asteroids themselves we would open ourselves up to immense quantities of every period element. 
While i admit asteroid mining isn't necessarily in the immediate future. It is going to happen. When it does it will vastly change the way we use many of the rare elements. Even more common ones such as iron, nickel, and copper are in huge lumps floating through space as we speak. All we need to do is reach out and grab them.
@_date: 2013-08-26 03:49:20
They would only be able to do so for a short period of time. Others would join the space mining and break the monopoly. 
@_date: 2013-08-25 22:28:01
Mining an asteroid would be to gain resources.. Precious metals are very valuable for many technologies.
