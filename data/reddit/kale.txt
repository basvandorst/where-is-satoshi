Shorting a stock is the exact same as traditional sales of stock. It creates no downward pressure of the stock. In fact, with a low liquidity stock, it can drive the price up, since it forces a buy when you initiate the short position.
Plus, shorting stock is dumb. Buy in-the-money put options. Much safer. Not sure if they exist for bitcoin yet.

You are correct that there is some psychological pressure, so I should correct myself to say no *technical* pressure on a price from short positions.

Market cap doesn't determine price stability, it's all how much is listed. Any bitcoin not listed on an exchange doesn't play into the price.
You can calculate how much money will move the price with the buy/ask charts. I don't know where those are for coinbase, but I bet you could really move the needle with $10k.
For the amount of money in bitcoin, I'd say it's very low liquidity, which means it's hard to cash out without crashing the price.

Governments can't keep up with business changes with Uber and AirBNB, I'm shocked they allowed them to grow as much as they have.
Technologies have gotten bigger and more quickly than governments have had time to respond, it seems. Although the U.S. government tends to be pretty permissive (seriously, don't laugh) until somebody gets hurt or loses their house.
In 15 years the world will look very different. It already looks pretty different from the 90s.

So there's not a single solution. Not that I'm an expert, but I think there needs to be a single solution to resolve.  Superposition means that something (say a cesium atom) is in multiple states until you observe it and it collapses to one of the states (decayed or not decayed).
Information is thrown away during a hash. Given any hash, there are infinite number of inputs to get that hash. There aren't an infinite number of private keys, but like you say, several key pairs share a hash.
Quantum calculation only speed up some things. Other things will be faster on a conventional CPU. Other things are "calculated" faster with other techniques (rather than go crazy with CFD calculations, put things in the wind tunnel!)
QC should speed up factorization, discrete logarithm, and if I'm not mistaken, a lot of path optimization problems. It's not a magic fast computer.

It can be done but it's HARD. I've tried on F12's unfactored component. In less than a second I showed it was composite. It's small compared to gargantuan numbers I've worked with before, but I've never found a factor after letting factoring algorithms run for weeks.
It wasn't a great factoring algorithm (Pollard Rho), but Field Number Sieves are a little more programming than I have time for right now.

Selling a stock is buying a stock. There's a seller and buyer in every transaction. The ask/bid spread is what sets the stock price. If there are more market order sells with limit order buys, that is when the price moves down, because you remove the highest limit order sells, leaving lower limit order sales.
When you short stock, the institution loaning you the stock executes a market order buy, which drives the price up slightly (it has no real effect on a high liquidity stock). You hope the stock goes down, so you can execute another market order buy to make it whole.

A good business guy would have said "let's hire a crack team of developers and top notch customer service people" rather than chase a hobby. The bitcoin industry is new, there's no "incumbent" exchange really. Had MTGox been on top of things they could have been 90% of market share by now.

I hate the Doge meme, but love the light hearted attitude that comes along with it. 
Bitcoin has almost become a religion. Instead of churches, synagogues, or mosques, it has exchanges. Instead of mission houses we have vendors. It has missionaries and zealots, and I don't even have to draw 
parallels. You know how Christians sometimes leave fake money tips at restaurants that have "The Gospel" written on them? Guess what's equally bad to most waiters as a tip... Paper wallets! There's even tracts for bitcoin! And instead of the ordained clergy, we have AISC owners. The select few that have a vested interest in singing the praises of the institution they are so invested in.
What I'm saying is, I believe in bitcoin. I use it at every opportunity. But I'm not paying $20k on an AISC miner that I may not get. I'm not leaving bitcoin paper wallets for tips unless my waiter is wearing a bitcoin button.
Doge community is so much less of a "revolutionary" mentality, and as a consequence is being used freely. It's totally a slave to BTC for exchange to fiat, of course, but as of yet, it's a very different attitude than BTC or LTC. I hate it, and I don't want to pay my house note in Doge, but it's a lesson that everyone should take to heart. Let's be calm about this. Bitcoin will find its place.

I'll postulate a new theory of what happened to Gox that I haven't seen mentioned yet:
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:20:53
This is me, speculating!
I'd imagine the deposits and withdrawals are accomplished by looking at the blockchain for incoming and outgoing transactions. Actual holdings are calculated by taking the difference of incoming - outgoing. The "Balance BTC" are from the internal engine, or what you get if you sum each user's BTC balance.
Why on earth you wouldn't keep a constant daily tally of the difference of the blockchain amount and the internal amount is beyond me, though.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:23:07
Certainly not the only one. I used tradehill until they closed, now I'm on CampBX. I'm hoping today makes a good buying opportunity for all coins.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:45:48
That's consistent with what I was saying.
I was speculating that their ledger is the 900k amount listed. Incoming BTC and outgoing BTC would be connected to the blockchain, though, which might be the final amount. The discrepancy is their internal system (the 900k) overestimating holdings. All trading occurred on the internal ledger (since trading and waiting on block confirmations would take too long).
I'm completely speculating though. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 13:37:56
Thanks! I really do feel bad for posting a meme when there are already a lot of them. I've been involved with bitcoin since 2011 (did all trading on tradehill until it closed) and it's been a wild ride. The memes, like sweets, should be used sparingly.

It's necessary though. During the over-glorified days of gold mining (which we keep hearing parallels to now) there were banks not well managed, and more than a few went under, taking people's money with them.
If you had a town hastily erected following discovery of gold, you'd have people that had no idea what they were doing founding a bank. If you were the only bank in town, people would use your services, despite not having a reputation.
They were known as [Wildcat Banks](  That's what's going on with wallets and exchanges now. Some are not healthy and we will be finding out about them.
My thoughts are that bitcoin is ready to self-regulate. Any exchange that's good will soon resort to auditing, by programmers and software engineers that understand the protocol and safe implementation. I'd rather trade on an exchange that has a self audit. I think the community is prepared for this now.
@_date: 2014-11-06 01:18:12
Technically, it targets a re-target of two weeks, but it does this by re-targeting every 2016 blocks. If every block is 10 minutes, that's 2016 blocks in two weeks. If hash rate drops by 10%, then it will take two weeks, one day, 9 hours, and about 36 minutes to get to 2016 blocks. If the hash rate were to drop to half of it's current rate, it would take four weeks to re-target.
(I should note that I haven't been involved with the low-level protocol of bitcoin in a couple of years, when tradehill was my exchange if that's any indication).

To do business in a country, you have to have a business license. Mt. Gox had a Japanese business license to conduct business in Japan. To work in the U.S., it had to have a U.S. Business license as well. The Dwolla incident was because the U.S. portion of Mt. Gox did not file the right paperwork to handle money.
Chapter 15 is a special business bankruptcy that deals with companies that are going bankrupt in other countries as well. Otherwise Mt. Gox's U.S. business would have to file a seperate bankruptcy and deal with both systems making demands (probably chapter 11). This makes it easier for U.S. courts to work with Japanese courts to recover as much of the customers' money as possible. (I removed creditors and equity holders since this is ELI5).

Maybe I'm understanding it incorrectly, but isn't every transaction a complete spend of an address, and a new address is generated for the unspent coin?

Yeah, it's saying that they will be bankrupt if required to honor all liabilities, but it may be salvageable if they have a little more time.
It's the same thought process and difference between a short sale and forclosure on a house. Short sales recognize a mortgage holder (in the case of real estate) are headed for default, and everyone wants the real estate sold, even if it's at a loss, before it comes to foreclosure.
*IF* Mark has a solution to recover all of the coins, this allows him to do so without going insolvent first from bills/invoices that are due. The "pre-bankruptcy" protection is allowed because if there's any chance of saving the coins, it's worth a shot as opposed to liquidation.
My hope, for those of you with balances on Gox, is that he's trying to re-create a php bug that generated faulty private keys, but in a salvageable way. Pure speculation on my part, but Gox does seem to love to deploy poorly tested code.

It is a weakness, but only for a precipitous fall in hashrate. If it were timed instead, there could be an attack vector of a large player bringing a massive amount of hashrate power online and gobbling up lots of blocks in a two week period. Now if someone were to greatly increase the hashrate, it would simply adjust much more quickly. Out of the two options (adjust by time vs adjust by set number of blocks), the current one is probably more resilient. If any event caused the hashrate to crash by 90%, there's a lot more to worry about than confirmation time.

I take issue with "average". Mode maybe, but average is generally accepted to have meaning with continuous or other numerical metrics. Mode would be the most populous, and can be non-numeric. The "average" person has one boob and half a penis, slightly less than two arms, slightly less than ten fingers, etc.
And is this the mode of each metric taken independently? I would think so as Christianity is not the most common religion among Han Chinese, right? If every metric is taken independently (and not as a group), the most common person would be a woman, Han Chinese, Christian, etc, right?

It seems to me if AISC's were going to be the next big hurdle that VIA chips would dominate, as they already have an SHA engine on-chip, running at Cache speed, I'm assuming. I realize it would have to be run twice since BitCoin mining is a double-hash operation.
Would this not count as a proof-of-concept that AISC's won't be quite as effective as everyone says? Via Nanos run at 2 GHz and one can get the MB/chip combo for less than $140.

This is my point. Sure if you have a few million to produce cards with thousands of transistors (like DeepCrack), you could get ASICs to work. By definition, it's Application Specific. However, The workload is close enough to graphic work to be calculated pretty quickly on a GPU. 
There's an idea in the forum that a purpose built ASIC with a low transistor count will dominate in the future. I don't see that happening. Maybe GPUs aren't the fastest method to calculate hashes, but they are easily the highest transistor count SIMD processor available for the money. If an ASIC is already on the market and not competing, why all the ASIC worry?

Each exchange has their own order book. That is the number that's exactly between buy and sell orders (or alternatively last transaction price). Smaller exchanges have worse liquidity and will be different.
The volume of arbitrage (buy on the low exchange, sell on the high exchange) isn't high enough to equalize prices yet. Also lag time with confirming transactions and the volatility make it more risky. When price settles down again you'll see arbitrage return and the exchanges will be much closer

I'm not a professional but I picked it up from Fin Cen's website. They walk though it, although finding the registration pdf wasn't super straightforward. I'm on my phone right now or I'd link it. Search for fincen and virtual currency for the listing. It's pretty clear they intend for miners to be classified as money transferrers for now

Unless your're being sarcastic and I'm missing it, Google China and Baidu are competitors, and Baidu is much larger. Your sentence is the same as "Ford is America's Chevrolet".

With price fluctuations being what they are, it is risky to buy on one and wait for the blockchain to transfer to the other exchange. The time in minutes of transfer is time for a lot to happen.
What would be awesome is if two exchanges worked out a peer trust system, where any transfers of cryptocurrency could be instant as soon as it's broadcast to the network. Then arbitrage would add more liquidity to both exchanges. One could even wait for verification before the final withdrawal, just allow low confirmation transfers to be traded as long as they came from a trusted address.

I'll pay 0.1 BTC for a bumper sticker or t-shirt that says that.

Well yes, that's it's inherent value. Namecoin for DNS is probably one of the best alternative uses of a blockchain.

As I understand the ruling, I have to be registered as a money transmitter as a miner (from my interpretation of FinCen announcement).

The ip issue is semi useful now. Chunks of ipv 4 addresses are hard to come by!

Please keep reinforcing this. Most of these posts forget that a lot of USD and other currencies are involved.

English is what happens when Latin from religion, early French from the ruling class, and Germanic from the common class all collide. We gain fancy words from French or Latin, and vulgar counterparts from the Germanic parts of the language. Dirty words were created because people preferred the Nobles language to sound "fancy", saying "urinate" instead of "piss". See also defecate, fornicate, etc. And vulgar used to mean common, but using the common words became synonymous with being lower class, so vulgar now means dirty.
English, from my limited study of German and French, seems to be much more flexible with sentence structure than other languages. Also dropping noun genders made it easier to learn I think.

666 is the real number of the beast, but it's not the mark of the beast. They're two different things.

That's news to me, although the case study we just finished about them was a couple of years old. So Google still operates Google.cn, but owns a stake in Baidu?

I think that's the idea. Or rather, each bitcoin being worth more and more, making the transaction fees worth the electrical cost.

Yeah. I'm changing my ideas about bitcoin though. I see exchanges, even if OTC exchanges, as critical to it's current role. Bitcoin is gold. It's a fungible, universal method to move wealth. Not necessarily a great currency at the moment. The value that bitcoin provides is the decentralized and untraceable method of transferring wealth with no limitations on local currencies or transportation costs, or even government involvement. That's very powerful.
I'm not convinced that a limited supply of currency will ever succeed. Gold was abandoned as a currency, it exists now as a method of storing wealth just fine. Gold is easy to store, bitcoin is easy to transfer. Both have issues at the moment as a currency.
I've thought about whether a crypto currency could work if it was designed to payout 4% more per year. That might provide a little stability. Although, we're so far away from the final mined block on bitcoin that limited supply isn't a problem yet.
