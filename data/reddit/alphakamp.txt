yup totatlly was.  I'm gonna give electrum a try, I orginally avoided it because the whole remote blockchain thing didnt sound like a good idea.  But I guess that may be the case for long term storage, but day to day stuff... I guess it is a necessity.

DERP I see my confusion now, I read that as  not electurm sorry

For certain it is not a watch only, I did see that 0.9.1 was out while i was still on 0.9.0.  Linux Mint for OS 32bit.  I took a look at the armory logs and saw this lovely... "Second script failed!  Exit Code: 0"

Ok, I can see the multiple wallet bit.  I may give Electrum a try.
@_date: 2014-04-14 03:23:03
wut?  electrum is just a proposal at this point, how the hell am I gonna buy a book with that?

Will it be available for purchase with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:04:14
Have yet to see it actually happen

Revolution in concept, not so great in real world use...

Down to lower than 40-20 in some branches

I dont think is so much a storage problem but a network problem.   I wouldnt mind storing even a terabyte but can you imaging downloading that just get started?  It took me about a week to download where it is now!

I have the same wallet on a better machine, as soon as it syncs up I will give it a try.  This must be why web based wallets are enticing?  Eh...wtf

Makes for good ted talk but just a pipe dream it seems... :/
@_date: 2014-04-14 03:22:07
hopefully before that.  the sad thing is, this is with a good internet connection.  People in third world countries with weak internet connections are supposed to download the 15gb+ blockchain? What fantasy world is that?
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:02:18
Ive heard that, im just not sure whey that keeps the price high
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:05:19
Eh.. I am trying to do the same, I am sending to an armory address, and once I send and click on the transaction coinbase says the transaction could not be found, and my balance is back to what it was...
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:32:50
But why is mtgox still so high?
@_date: 2014-04-14 03:19:26
So do you have an mosnter machine?  The first machine I attempted to work with has about 1gb ram and older single core processor, people make purchase with phones with worse specs dont they?
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:27:05
Ok I can see that

0.0000285 seems pretty low to me, none instant transactions were higher
@_date: 2016-03-03 14:17:55
I'm in a similar situation, I was using greenbits and stupidly used 'instant confirmation' that uses a low fee... I'm not sure I'll ever get my 0.1 now

Does anyone believe this mofo anymore
