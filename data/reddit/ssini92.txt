You’re so educated and cultured.

Ok Phil Collins. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:35:17
Ok so they also are also supporting buying. It was heavily likely they would. It shouldn’t be a huge shock either way.  And I also don’t think it’s a big deal. 
Here’s an article about it from August.

That’s not a month ago brah
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:09:25
Honestly fuck off lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:44:13
And now here i sit with free BCH. Diversifying niggah it’s all a bubble anyways. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:47:21
Are there actually people that don’t understand this?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:20:52
“Awhile” Try a couple weeks. So much impatience, we are still up 50% this month. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:02:44
They said when the hard fork happened they would be supporting it early January. They were a couple weeks early. Wtf is the big deal I just got free money. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:50:22
Ok well I’ll see you next month when BTC sits at $22k
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:05:48
They said months ago they would be supporting it. It’s not really a threat to BTC value, explain the issue?  
Edit: also, how can you say coinbase is trying to kill bitcoin?  It’s the foundation of their business and has made them millions of dollars. If they “killed” bitcoin coinbase would most likely kill itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:26:54
Yes I understand what happened. What I’m saying is when I was watching it skyrocket I was thinking in my head, GDAX is going to go down. It has happened before on these kinds of runs and this was the largest yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:07:22
Sorry I meant 30 days..
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:40:45
It’s because it went up 2000% in a handful of months and into the tens of thousands of dollars. It’s unreal and obviously something people are going to talk about. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:14:53
Go to twitter for crypto news he says. 
You mean RussianBotFarm tm
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:09:00
30 days brah
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:37:00
All I did was hold and do absolutely nothing though. People that were buying BCH at 9000 are retarded. How can people not see stuff like this coming?  I sat on my ass, did nothing, and got $500 in free BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:15:51
Bitcoin is up 100% this month. There is a dip as people adjust to BCH. Absolute mental midget you are. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:42:51
Or you can just downvote me that works too. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:42:36
Lol crazy. How you can look at something like bitcoin and not see/understand the risk is baffling. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:08:47
I mean duh it was obviously going to go down at some point during that run it’s happened multiple times already. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:15:34
No they didn’t you can see the spike go off the fucking screen. Also if you are a big enough retard to buy BCH at 9 fucking thousand it’s your fault. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 02:09:02


Looks about right to me
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:43
Bill Novogratz can suck my nuts
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:11:07
Eat your nut!
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:11:58
Eat your left ball!
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:27:19
Didnt the fork get blocked?  Sorry I don’t pay attention to bitcoin news really. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:05:06
Ty for update my dude. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:52:21
Remind me! 5 years
Tell this guy he's retarded
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:42:01
But the value of the lambo is based on $$$ ����
@_date: 2017-07-11 17:39:39
What's the new currency called?  And are you saying gaming is over because these gpus are going up a bit in price?  It's doing wonders for my tech portfolio. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:44:25
Do people actually still mine with GPUs anymore?
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:50:34
Hasn't it been proven to be fairly inefficient?  Aren't purpose built miners the thing now? Antminer etc?
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:03:42
Well I don't care enough to look it up I was hoping you would just tell me. Hope your GPU doesn't die bro. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:00:23
Buy a button down shirt and some slacks and get a job dude.
