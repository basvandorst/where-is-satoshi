What's the mailing list? Intrigued! 
Thank you :)

They are making millions a day. Hiring 5 Bitcoin core developers to work on building Bitcoin out, investing in research and helping ensure Bitcoin becomes the currency of the Internet isn't asking an awful lot. The annual salaries of 5 core developers would come nowhere near that 2.7 million daily figure. 
It's an absolute no brainer, Coinbase should be improving the foundations their business is built upon. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:44:45
Making all that money and not supporting the open source protocols that their business relies upon is awful behaviour.
I still can't fathom why, when they have such enormous financial resources, they aren't investing a chunk in making sure Bitcoin develops. They really should have an in house team of a good handful of developers building and extending Bitcoin. If they kept improving Bitcoin then maybe they would have years, or decades, of these sorts of incredible financial returns.
Sad to see what they've become.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:00:31
Pretty sure that's the paper!
There's also a good talk on Lightning in YouTube by Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon from a couple of years back, they introduce the whole concept. If you're interested in lightning development check out Elizabeth Stark's Lightning Labs company and the Lightning work that Rusty Russell has been doing at Blockstream. There's loads of information out there, GitHubs if you want to help out with code/development. Lightning is on its way, just needs a bit more of a push to help get there! I'm sure with your background you might have something to contribute. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:56:35
I'd think about applying for some funding from the Pineapple Fund.
Money could be used to educate more devs/workshops. Or even for funding bounties for finding bugs or for improving lightning code itself. The more people we can have working on the project the better. 
I think it'd be a great idea and Pineapple Fund is looking to support Bitcoin projects. It'd be a good win for the community. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:31:55
Ah, even more financial products built upon open source software coinbase dont bother contributing to.
coinbase are the worst.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:33:47
More than welcome.
There's a whole rabbit hole of information to fall down on this topic. If you're unsure on the blockchain then Satoshi's white paper is the go to, that was the technological breakthrough that started his whole industry off. 
Lightning is one of a number of new technologies that are emerging to try and enhance the basic Bitcoin blockchain. There are efforts to increase privacy, smart contracts features, fungibility, improve chain efficiency and much more. Lightning is focused on improving the number of transactions that Bitcoin can process. The presentations at the Scaling Bitcoin conferences are usually found online easily and are at the cutting edge of Bitcoin/blockchain research.
There's a lot of good information out there, if you're more into development then looking at GitHub repositories and discussion lists might be more your thing too.

What is so great about How to Win Friends and Influence People? It sounds a bit snake oil salesman-y to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:31:41
Likewise, though I barely have any so need it to rise massively before I can give anything useful away.
I just think if you've made millions off Bitcoin then it would be great to give something back. This pineapple fund is over $50m, imagine what a few million could do for Bitcoin core development. We have loads of work still to be done on privacy, scaling, fungibility, smart contracts, research and development and a whole lot more. If it was me, a good chunk of the fund would be backing Bitcoin and making it better than it's ever been. 
We just need to convince whoever is behind this pineapple fund to give a bit back to Bitcoin now!

@_date: 2017-12-19 12:18:20
Why don't you apply for some funding from the Pineapple Fund Jack to enable you and another developer to go full time at it for a year or two?
The fund has a huge amount of money and they are taking applications on their website. What you have done so far is great, a bit of support and you would be flying. The next year or two are going to be vital for lightning so it's definitely worth going all in.

Great donation!
Hope he or she considers donating to support core development, makes sense to give a bit back to Bitcoin after making so much money!

Going to look into this book, thanks for the tip! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:16:58
Why don't you tweet them and ask?
I agree, if they want Bitcoin to succeed then they should back it financially. They've already made a killing on their coins so hiring a few developers to work on Bitcoin would be great! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:08:07
This warms my heart. I would love to see the Pineapple Fund give back to Bitcoin and help it develop. That would leave a lasting legacy. Thank you for listening to us all!

MIT has the Digital Currency Initiative which is desperate for more funding to support developers working on Bitcoin core development. There is loads of work to be done on scaling, security, privacy, fungibility, side chains and much more if Bitcoin is ever to achieve its potential. 
Please consider supporting Bitcoin's future u/PineappleFund
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:49:01
Fantastic stuff! 
I hope you are able to take the time to find my comments in this thread, or to view them on my profile. I really think giving back to Bitcoin, it is open source software after all, would be such a wonderful way to spend some of this money. 
Right now, it is really sad that so few developers are working on Bitcoin core. A little bit of money could see more help in terms of scaling solutions, privacy, fungibility, side chains, MAST, schnoor signatures, smart contracts and much more.
I really hope you consider giving back to Bitcoin after it has given so much to you. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:55:26
Congratulations on your wealth and kudos to you for wanting to do good and share the love.
As you have done so well financially off the back off Bitcoin, have you considered giving back to the open source Bitcoin community..? Bitcoin is far from a complete project and unfortunately there are very few paid core developers working to improve the software. Scaling, privacy, smart contracts, research and development...there is so much to do! Taking a bit of money and employing a developer or two to work on the core would be such a huge help. 
You could do it privately and hire a developer on a salary or I'm sure you could discuss with either Blockstream or Chain code labs. They work on Bitcoin core and would likely point you in the right direction. Perhaps you could donate to a particular project they are working on (such as lightning, mimblewimble, or side chains?). 
I believe MIT also has taken funds from private individuals to support Bitcoin research and development. I'd consider reaching out to them too. 
It would be just awesome for Bitcoin to get a real developer boost, imagine a project sponsored by you that makes it into Bitcoin and lasts forever in the code...
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask! Thank you for listening :) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:42:26
We don't deserve you, Andreas.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:09:38
Wow, what an incredible donation!
How about a similar amount to fund Bitcoin core development? We have so much to do and need as many people working on the code as possible...scaling, privacy, fungibility, new research and development, security and much more all need supporting! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:11:59
Would love to see the Pineapple Fund give MIT some funds to support Bitcoin developments. There is so much to do...lightning networks/scaling, privacy, fungibility, security, MAST, sidechains and much more. 
Creating and supporting Bitcoin based scholarships at MIT would be a great way to grow Bitcoin core development. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:05:52
Set up a scholarship or two at MIT focused on Bitcoin development and give back to this great community!

Thanks for doing this guys, big fan of EB!
My question surrounds core development/the programmable nature of Bitcoin. 
As someone who has worked on open source software for almost a decade my enthusiasm for Bitcoin is waning. So much venture capital but little development, research, bug testing and so forth. 
Clearly you are significantly invested in this sector and stand to make out well if Bitcoin flourishes. Furthermore, your father has publicly stated he believes that Bitcoin will be worth $10k in a few years. My main question is why aren't you investing in a handful of high quality developers to work on making Bitcoin the best currency on earth? It has the potential but it needs a lot of attention. 
Hell, we don't even have any cryptographers working on the project...even ethereum have Koblitz. That's damning. 
I am finding it increasingly hard to justify spending my development time on Bitcoin software and projects when the leading companies and investors with millions of dollars just aren't willing to lead the way.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:16:35
Look into Coin Center, they are an advocacy group working to educate regulators, both in the US and worldwide, on Bitcoin to try to make sure it isn't banned. They are funded by donations and desperately need the support.

I am a noob but I think I understand your answer. 
Could you explain clearly what the 'encrypted key' and the 'passphrase are'? 
How do they differ from the normal private key and public address?
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:56:35
Think I'll leave Brainwallets for now, BIP38 seems the safer option.
How easy is it to spend BIP38 wallets? Would I be able to go to an online store and spend right away, or do I need to sweep my funds into a wallet provider first (e.g. Blockchain, Circle, Coinbase)? 
@_date: 2014-12-01 00:39:13

@_date: 2014-05-26 16:46:23
Awesome - think i've grasped the Brainwallet thing. If I remember my private and public keys for my Brainwallet, then I don't really need my passphrase..right?
Just need to get my head around the BIP38 stuff now, thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:11:51
Thank you for your answer, I appreciate it. 
I agree, cryptography is not a weak link 'right now'. 
However, I find your answer deeply worrisome, cryptographic research and security is a fundamental issue that the Bitcoin Foundation should take a proactive approach towards. Anticipation of risk is crucial for any open source project to thrive. Saying it's OK today does not mean it will be OK tomorrow. 
Hope is not enough when we are securing billions of value. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:00:34
Hey all!
Could someone explain the difference between a 'passphrase' on a 'brain wallet' and a 'BIP38' 'passphrase'?
I'm not sure if they are the same thing, and how they work. Would really appreciate getting to understand how this all works :) Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:50:45
The link below is well worth a watch:
In October it was estimated he held between 20-30K in BTC. He stated he wanted to buy more at that point too. No-one knows if he still owns a single Bitcoin, but I'd imagine he still has all his holdings as he is consistently tweeting about Bitcoin...if you look at his timeline you can see how peeved he was about Apple KOing Blockchain!
@_date: 2014-06-02 16:11:12
Ahh! :D
With a Brainwallet, if someone knew either my passphrase or my private key, they can get access to my funds..right?
With BIP38, someone needs to know both my BIP38 passphrase and the encrypted key. If they knew one but not the other, there's no way to get access to my funds. Right?
Assuming I'm correct in those thoughts, it seems like Brainwallets are a bit dangerous. Whereas BIP38 wallets have an extra layer of protection compared to standard wallets. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 21:58:47
Thank you, really grateful for your help today :)
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:29:29
Really appreciate your response, definitely getting a better understanding of this! 
I completely understand public address, private address and encrypted key now. A little unsure re 'passphrase'.
When I go to bitaddress.org - I can go into the 'Paper Wallet' tab, select BIP38 and enter a passphrase. This gives me a public address (to send funds to) and the encrypted key. In order to spend the funds at the public address, I need to know both the encrypted key and the BIP38 passphrase I typed in to create the paper wallet. Is this correct?
When I go to the Brainwallet tab it asks me to enter (and confirm) a passphrase. This then creates a public address and a private key. The private key is not encrypted. 
You stated that a 'passphrase = what you type into the brainwallet page to get your private key (and hence bitcoins). It's also what you need to spend your BIP38 coins'. Looking at the brainwallet tab on bitaddress.org, I don't understand where BIP38 even comes into play? Am I missing something glaringly obvious?
I'm definitely getting there, just a lot to get my little head around!
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:00:37
So my profit of £100 would be taxed under income tax rules only? And only when I've undertaken enough trades to go over my personal threshold of £10k?
What defines whether an individual on Localbitcoins has to register as a business? I would expect the high volume traders to have to understandably, but what about those who are only trading a few btc a week or so? 
Banks are an issue, trying to find a solution to that but it is a slow and cumbersome process. I can't begin to imagine the difficulties you've been having! Though with the sensible HMRC news, I imagine you're able to put the pedal to the floor and push your business forward more now?
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:07:00
Great explanation!
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:24:41
I read your exchange last night as I'm a big CP fan and follow him on Twitter. 
He has expressively stated that he does not back Bitcoin businesses though and his only involvement is in holding Bitcoin. I had figured that by stating 'already funded' he was pointing to the fact there are US exchanges in the pipeline already (e.g CoinX which is well on the way to getting licenses in all 50 states). 
Perhaps you could follow up and ask what company/ies and if he does actually have any involvement? This would be really interesting to know!
@_date: 2014-08-19 14:41:14
I'm probably asking a stupid question, but I hope someone can humour me. 
One of the biggest concerns with Bitcoin is volatility. Great services (e.g. Bitpay) effectively eradicate the volatility problem for merchant acceptance. On the consumer side there is no such service and individuals are left exposed to volatility. 
Is there any way a company (like Coinbase) could allow individuals to purchase Bitcoin at its market dollar value (currently circa $500) and the Bitcoin keeps that $500 dollar value...(even if the USD value of a Bitcoin was to fall or rise significantly)?
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:02:44
That's a great help, thank you!
Is it not a little concerning that BIP38 decryption isn't an industry standard? If I put some Bitcoin into a BIP38 wallet now, then a few years down the line decide I want to spend that Bitcoin, what happens if I can't find a wallet that does BIP38 decryption...? 
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:19:51
Interesting. The way I'm reading this it all sounds very progressive from HMRC. 
I'm interested in what this means for people who use Localbitcoins, especially wary after the Florida arrests. Just to clarify:
If, for example, I bought 1 btc for £500 and sold it for £600, what does this mean for me tax wise? 
Do LocalBTC users need to register as an exchange business or something similar..?
@_date: 2014-09-08 12:54:01
Hey all. Hope some of you have a little time to help me get my head around bitaddress. Here goes:
I've spent the past few weeks getting a proper understanding of Bitcoin, and of safe storage. From what I've read, using bitaddress offline and creating a BIP38 encrypted wallet is one of the best ways to secure funds at present. 
I understand that on bitaddress, one has to navigate to the paperwallet tab, check the bip38 encrypt box, enter a passphrase, and click generate. This will give a Bitcoin address to send funds to and an encrypted private key. My understanding is that in order to spend funds you just need the encrypted private key and the passphrase you used....right?
I can then navigate to the wallet details tab, put in my private key and BIP38 passphrase and click decrypt BIP38. Can somebody help explain what the point of this is? And what it means? It gives me all sorts of information that I do not understand..(bitcoin address compressed, public key 130 characters, public key compressed 66 characters, private key WIF, private key WIF compressed, private key hexidecimal, private key base64..). Trying to get my head around this but I'm struggling!
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:02:09
No worries - I was excited reading your exchange with him last night!
If your interpretation is correct and he has invested in an exchange, that is brilliant news full stop.
If my intepretation is correct, it sounds like he is pretty happy with what is going on anyway. 'Already funded. It's coming'  I can't imagine he would make that type of statement if something rubbish with poor backing was in the pipeline. Personally, I just read his comment as if someone has got the situation covered and he's content with it. A good thing too. 
Edit - you should check out the link I posted above as it gives CP's Bitcoin background. I look forward to him getting back to you. Make sure you keep tweeting the big VCs on twitter about Bitcoin investments!!
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:20:56
Thanks for the reply, really appreciate all your help.
How is it possible to save bitaddress.org? I'm keen to do the same as you are (usb with my paper wallet), then probably migrate to Trezor or use Bitgo when I'm more comfortable with what I'm doing. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:25:11
Hey Gavin, thanks for doing this!
Do you think the Bitcoin Foundation should employ a cryptographic expert? 
For comparison, Ethereum has lured Merkle and Koblitz, two of the best cryptographers alive. I'm deeply concerned that Bitcoin is securing billions of pounds, yet key security concerns are not being addressed as proactively as they really should be. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:00:59
So I can spend from a BIP38 wallet straight into an online shop? 
@_date: 2014-06-02 11:48:04
Hey guys, appreciate this thread every week :)
I'm far from the best with technology, and I'm finding a few things pretty damn technical. 
My question is, what is considered 'safer' for storing funds - a Brain wallet or a BIP38 encrypted wallet? 
I think the latter is safer, as it's like having a wallet with two passwords...a private key and the BIP38 password. And that in order to access/spend the funds you need both the private key and the BIP38 password to do so. Having just one of the two means you cannot get into the wallet.
Please ELI5, because I find a lot of the terminology pretty intimidating! Thank you :)
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:34:09
Thanks so much for the response, really appreciate it!
Just to get this absolutely clear:
1. If I do BIP38 encryption - I need both the BIP38 encryption password and the private key to spend funds, right? If I have either one of the two, that's not enough to get at my wallet is it? 
2. If I create a Brainwallet and passphrase, after it is created why is the passphrase important? Don't I just need to remember my private key and public address?
@_date: 2015-05-11 16:22:49
Can you ELI5 what you believe is happening with 21? Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-04-14 15:52:11

I'm certain an AMA would go down really well. I'm sure plenty of people would like to hear from Halsey, a seasoned tech entrepreneur, his perspectives on Bitcoin, its future, and Bitreserve. 
I feel that because Bitreserve was a little later to market (vs Blockchain.info, Coinbase etc), it has flown a bit under the radar. Something like this would be a good way to put it on the map. Plus, establishing good links with the community is always beneficial, there are a lot of intelligent people with some excellent ideas on here.

"World wide ledger" is a fantastic phrase, simple and elegant. Bitcoin companies/advocates ought to use it more.
It sounds like World Wide Web, so immediately it commands attention and is less likely to be dismissed. It is without the somewhat tarnished word 'Bitcoin', and the hard to understand 'blockchain'. 
Worldwide ledger is the sort of branding we should be using.

Any chance of Halsey doing an AMA on here? I think it'd certainly help raise awareness of Bitreserve in the community. I've listened to him speak about Bitreserve on a few podcasts here and there, but it would be nice to get some full on engagement with the community sometime. Hope so anyway!

Jack is an absolute hero for funding Bitcoin core development, cannot applaud him enough.
I'm still amazed that the big exchanges, crypto companies and whales haven't been hiring developers to improve Bitcoin core. They stand to gain massively if Bitcoin succeeds so they should be doing their bit. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 01:34:44
Major props to Jack. Might sign up to Twitter just to thank him!
Bitcoin core needs a lot more development, we have come this far but there is still a long road to go. There are all sorts of improvements that need working on and implementing.
I've been really disappointed to see barely any Bitcoin businesses and whales funding development. These guys stand to gain massively if they were to help aid Bitcoin development.

This is a great 'hobby' to cultivate. A decade or two ago cryptography was extremely fringe, now IT firms, banks and even the upper echelons of governance are fiercely battling over the small pool of talent. Some of the salaries that I'm aware of through colleagues and friends in the valley are damn outrageous. I see exactly the same future for developers in bitcoin.
The more pioneers like you build and extend the capabilities of bitcoin, the more likely the mainstreaming of this technology. If that happens then you'll be shit hot property. 
Spent the morning looking through this, your work is outstanding. You should be really proud of yourself. Hope to see more of your work in future!

I'm glad you boffins at Microsoft acknowledge that the security and decentralisation features are fundamentally important.
I'd also add another critical component, that Bitcoin is internet like in that it is another platform for permissionless innovation. Like the internet where anyone can build their own website, application, or just write their own blog post, anyone anywhere can build upon Bitcoin's financial plumbing. No gatekeepers, licenses, or barriers to entry. 
I have built financial infrastructure for banks, hedge funds and Ecommerce companies for the last 20 years. These companies do not open up their software to others without significant wrangling (if at all). Private blockchains won't be built upon and won't unleash any meaningful innovation. Anyway, the notion of a private blockchain is frankly ludicrous, database tech banks already use are much more efficient.

I know the very developer at Coinbase working on lightning, his initials are JP, he's a great guy. 
My point still stands Dan. Coinbase should be investing a lot more of that billion dollar revenue on open source bitcoin development. We all want bitcoin to survive and grow, having just one open source developer is damning.
You guys at Coinbase should be doing everything to improve the bitcoin protocol. Coinbase's long term success depends on it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:41:01
Credit due, well done Coinbase.
I am appalled they have just one sole developer working on bitcoin development. Coinbase made over a billion in revenue last year, yet its pennies for developing the very open source software their business depends on. Software that needs extensive upgrading (privacy, fungibility, scaling are a few starters).
Coinbase have built out a great business, they are a big exchange and are well positioned to be a future giant. They should be investing some of their revenues to develop bitcoin into the world changing tech it has the potential to be. Improving core software will only grow the chances of bitcoin success and, ultimately, Coinbase's success. There is potential for a trillion dollar market cap, and with that massive growth in Coinbase revenues. But bitcoin needs investment and developers to go all the way, it is still experimental software.

Bitcoin is not accepted directly at Starbucks.
However, the company in this article allows you to use Bitcoin through their platform to get Starbucks credit. Behind the scenes the company, Fold, buys a large amount of Starbucks credit at significant discount. They then pass on the majority of the discount to their individual users. So you load up Fold, send $10 of Bitcoin, and get $12 of Starbucks credit to spend. 
20% extra credit is a big bonus, probably the biggest incentive I've seen in the Bitcoin space to date.

I have been happy to run nodes as the network required bootstrapping and needed the support. Financially I can afford to run these nodes in perpetuity. It is not about money, it is about seeing a project develop. 
I have been amazed to watch the Bitcoin economy mature and see the huge capital raises take place. I am complaining because the companies that are expecting to make significant fortunes off the back of an open source project refuse to invest in the very foundations they are building their empires upon. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:29:41
Thank you.
I cannot begin to tell you how frustrated I feel. Bar Bitpay, no-one seems to care. All that money Coinbase has received and not a single core developer on their team. Not one single cryptographer employed across the whole Bitcoin space. Is anyone actually sponsoring rigorous scientific research? 
I run 3 full nodes, 2 in the US and 1 in Europe. There is no compensation, I do this out of good faith. I've contributed code for various projects on BCT, and have been working on my own project (a customisable wallet company). I'm not sure I can continue much longer. 
People love to celebrate the open source nature of Bitcoin, but that only works when the companies are actually actively supporting protocol development. We are built upon shaky foundations. More people need to be asking questions. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:32:13
They need to put a large chunk of the money towards encouraging adoption. 
It's all well and good "enabling greater ease of use and enhancing security", but really it's a flawed strategy if no-one wants to use Bitcoin anyway. We need more reasons for people to want to hold and use Bitcoin. If that happens then Circle will have no worries marketing their services. 
Would also be a smart PR move if Circle stepped up and employed a core developer too. This is a programmable currency with vast potential, we should be doing everything we can to make it the best currency on earth.

Congratulations Bruce! 
My concerns surround core development. 
I am grateful to the foundation as they are directly paying salaries to support developers working on core. 
However, besides Bitpay with Jeff Garzik, what companies are actually paying for developers to work on contributions to core?
As someone who has worked on open source software for almost a decade my enthusiasm for Bitcoin is fast on the wane. So much venture capital but little development, research, bug testing and so forth. Hell, we don't even have any cryptographers working on the project...even ethereum have Koblitz. That's damning. 
Over the course of the past 3 years I have asked Brian Armstrong, Blockchain.info and the Winklevoss twins if they are willing to support core. Nothing. 
The Winklevoss twins have publicly stated they expect bitcoin to become a trillion dollar asset, yet can't be bothered to support this realisation. 
No longer am I willing to spend my development time on Bitcoin software and projects when the leading companies with millions of dollars just aren't willing to lead the way.
Have you any personal thoughts on how to address this?

Kudos to MIT for taking the lead, though I'm surprised other universities have been slow to act. 
The Bitcoin Foundation should still be collecting money from individual companies to support core development. There are still not enough people working on Bitcoin core.
If the Foundation cannot do this simple task then they'll be all but dead.

I've been thinking about mining reward drop next year. What impact do people think it will have?

Where's the interview at?

That's great to hear. Involving institutions/academics from Asia is a must, a lot of the infrastructure is out there (far more than is being reported by western media outlets) so they need to be involved. Plus, who knows where the next major advance in this field will come from...
I've a couple of contacts in Japan who may be interested so will give them a buzz on LinkedIn in due course and point them to Ledger. Joi Ito at MIT is very keen on Bitcoin and related technology, it is worth trying to network with him through your current MIT links. Joi is one of the most respected tech guys here in Japan, if he's interested I'd imagine he'd be able to open all kinds of doors for you there. 
I'd also look into the Alan Turing Institute in England, the UK government is putting a substantial amount of money into crypto research and exploration and the ATI is the front for it. It's in its infancy but it is being run by leading computer science academics from UCL, Cambridge, Oxford and a few other institutions. My friend is doing a mining related thesis at Kings College London and he has told me a few professors have set up a Bitcoin related programme. I imagine those guys would be interested in being involved in Ledger. 
Unfortunately I don't know any Korean academics, though there is a small Bitcoin community out there. Korbit is probably the biggest Korean Bitcoin startup so they might be worth contacting (whether directly or through Tim Draper one of their principal investors who has a lot of contacts in that region). Probably worth networking with Barry Silbert who has a lot of investments in this space across the globe (Unocoin in India, Bitpesa in Kenya, BitX in South Africa etc). 
Just a few ideas to ponder there, will definitely keep my eye on this project. A huge amount of potential here for a major academic (and business) contribution, good luck with it!

You are right, Blockstream is the single largest employer of core developers. I deliberately left them out of my post as they are a relatively new entrant to the space. I'm reserving my opinion on them for the moment. 
I assume you are  on twitter? If so I hope you can read my reply to jratcliff in this thread. I am trying to raise mission critical issues that need to be heard widely. I know you have a good voice in the community that people listen to.

Congratulations - hopefully this is the start of big things for the Philippines and Bitcoin! 
I'm interested to know what are you guys planning to do to support Bitcoin core development? Would love to see a local core developer hired out there! 
@_date: 2015-09-15 18:05:44
Congratulations on this initiative, if executed appropriately then it is a huge step. 
I was a little surprised to see such an American influence though, particularly as Bitcoin has no centre of power and is a global phenomenon. Have you considered reaching out to/partnering up with Chinese, Japanese and Korean universities? 
China is home to a significant amount of mining infrastructure, I've visited 3 mining farms out there, yet there is little academic recognition/interest in Bitcoin. Japan, where I live, is unsurprisingly very anti Bitcoin because of MTGOX. An initiative like Ledger whilst helping to improve the technology, can also help the Bitcoin narrative.

Good luck with the project, sounds like you've had quite an adventure! Having met so many people in the space, where do you think Bitcoin will be in 10 years time? 
Edit - Forgot to ask if we can buy your book in the UK? Hope so! 
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:23:38
Noticed IBWT were listed amongst those that made representations to government here - your customers really appreciate it so thank you!
On the other hand, I am pretty outraged that Blockchain.info could not be bothered to comment. Considering they are by far the best venture backed Bitcoin company in the UK (around £20m) and even have the serious gravitas of renowned British entrepreneur Richard Branson on board. Jesus. What the hell is going on there?! 
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:15:26
Good luck to the guys, hope they are able to bring big things to Bitcoin in future. 
One thing I do find worrisome is the fact that they own ~1% of all BTC, expect this to grow into a market worth over 1 trillion, but don't support core development. This is a programmable currency with incredible potential and a lot of challenges still to overcome. 
If I owned 1% of this currency, I'd be putting all kinds of efforts into making it hands down the best currency on earth. 
Employing a handful of excellent developers to work on Bitcoin core, testing, open source tools and Wink projects is the very least these guys should be doing.

Tricky. I know Overstock are selling it for Bitcoin on their website, amazon stock it too. Could you order from there? 
I've just had a look and it'd cost me about £25-£30 to buy you a copy and pay for delivery from UK to Barbados. If that's any help?

It's the freaking weekend!!
@_date: 2015-02-25 14:00:27
Thought as much! 
How are you finding discussions with regulators in the UK? It seems the UK is a bit behind the curve on Bitcoin and banks are even more hostile than in the US.
@_date: 2015-02-22 00:34:28
I know the very same feeling. Try not to sweat it too much, people all have different interests and greater priorities. At the moment bitcoin is searching for that key use case/app that makes people like those in your friendship group need to use it. Then their priorities will change.
I'm not sure where you're based but many cities have a Bitcoin meet up group on meetup.com. I'd certainly recommend checking that out, people are very welcoming in this community. That, and conferences, seem to be the best places to meet likeminded people who share this passion. 
At least we do still have forums so not too bad :) There are also chat rooms which are a bit more 'conversational', and letstalkbitcoin has plenty of podcasts if you want to listen to people waxing lyrical about the space. Good luck!

Thanks - hadn't picked up on that! Will do some digging and will retract my comment if they did support the UK DCA's representation. 
Even if they did comment through the DCA, they should be leveraging the likes of Branson and their other institutional investors better. Having one of the biggest Bitcoin companies in the UK should really be shouted from the rooftops more, especially if we want to encourage positive policy developments. 
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:24:10
No worries, just thought I might be able to help somehow. 
Glad you got sorted out, hope the book is good!

Standing on the shoulders of some intellectual giants here, kudos to Princeton and all their collaborators!

You have such a long list, I've struggled to uncover any charities that accept Bitcoin that you haven't already twigged onto! 
I don't think you have Solar Cookers International though! You can see they accept Bitcoin on their website  It's under the donate category :) 
P.S. This is a good charity because if we all used solar cookers we could offset all that mining power ;)

No, LX is based in New York whereas this is a new brokerage based in the UK.

I'd love to try too!
