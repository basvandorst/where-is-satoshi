The worst bit was I was going to buy in to it even though I thought that, unfortunately I bought something from someone that turned out to not be real and ended up being scammed, I got the money back luckily but I thought nuts to that I don't want to lose money to something else that I barely trust
If it's of any interest the guy was called MUFC2007 and it was about 3 years ago on a forum called Facepunch (There's probably loads more information on the incident somewhere) and he was actually pretty decent (to his buyers) before he scammed everyone.
It's generally assumed that the things he was selling were stolen from retailers or gotten through pretending the items were never received, this would explain why he could sell things for a lot cheaper than they were listed in stores, but nobody thought badly of it because he actually delivered the items, he claimed to just be a reseller but his prices were way too cheap, however everyone backed him up at the time because they were getting the items regardless of where they were from.
After a few months of nothing really going on and everyone being happy with him he decided to do a big sale on all the things he was selling for already unbelievable prices, things like gaming mice that were $90 being sold for $50 and then in this sale being at just $25, however it turned out that nobody got these things they had bought, this whole sale was just a scam to get money because we trusted and believed him, paypal disputes left some people losing loads of money to paypal freezing the account because the money was sent as a gift (as MUFC2007 requested)
It's thought that the reason he ended up doing one big scam is because the retailers caught on to him abusing their system to get free stuff and he figured he was already in trouble so he might as well try and get rich before he got caught.
None of this seemed to ever get followed up on, we had someone who worked with the police get given full access to his account and all his messages and logs of people talking to him and nobody really knows if anything happened out of it.
This was around 2010 and I was a young and dumb student so even if I thought it might be a scam I was still willing to drop $20-$30 on bitcoin *just in case* something came out of it, but after experiencing almost being scammed I just completely backed out and never really looked at it again till now.
It's kind of an interesting story on why I didn't end up investing, I don't expect another tip but I hope this story was worth the original tip you gave me \^-\^

Holy crap! I'm pretty new to all this and trying to get figured out on buying and using bitcoin, but it's pretty awesome what you guys are doing!
Hopefully one day I'll be donating a thousand dollars to help feed the homeless, just gotta figure out how to get my own food with bitcoin first

Hey thanks for the tip! I am not sure if there's something extra I should be doing but I tried using the bitcointip bot and nothing came up, I guess because it never replied to say it was verified?
I looked around and found this: 
which suggests that you could try again since it missed the comment and even trying these 10 hours later I still don't seem to have anything
I wouldn't normally make a big deal out of what i think is about $1 but I'm just starting out trying to use it so it would help \^-\^

I didn't think about how you could use qr codes in a sort of physical form like that, imagine tipping someone irl with bitcoin you just scan their qr code on their waiter nameplate or whatever and just tip away
I am pretty new to this whole thing, one of those people that heard about it years ago and thought it was just senseless and people were wasting their time but now I see how big and very real it is, it's exciting seeing it get bigger each day too, makes me really want to get in to all this market price stock mumbo jumbo
