yes just got one though looking at my records I think I'm literally $50 over the $20K.
Pretty annoying as I'm not even a US citizen and have nothing to do with the IRS so not really happy.
In the UK - and fortunately was totally upfront on previous HMRC tax returns (and my accountants) - Bitcoin is specifically disclosed by name as is all related income/capital gains.  Already paid like £250K in related taxes and have another £120K to pay next tax return in a few months.
This will just be the start as the IRS will inevitably find people with such a large (though smaller than originally requested) net.

From a UK tax perspective (which is what applies to me) I assume there's nothing to declare until you actually trade it (for other crypto/cash/whatever).
At that point it's 100% capital gain.

This isn't advice - but I calculated mine on a FIFO basis.  That's actually the least advantageous for my tax position, but probably the one HMRC would want if they chose to investigate my return.
As well as exchanges I spent a significant amount of BTC on Amazon gift cards, supermarket cards etc but declared that disposal so could work out Capital Gain.  That along with all the other bits of doing my tax return is not a period of like 2 weeks I remember fondly.....
It's not just Americans - western country tax authorities will already be looking to do what the IRS did - and it won't just be Coinbase.  Just a matter of time.
