Hillary ensures war with the Russians and thus life in the stone ages again so...Trump? At least there will still be electricity.

It's kind of an interesting test to see what kind of impact one disgruntled person can have on people's perception of bitcoin. The news industry thrives on muck and drives how the public moves their money around. The question, as always, is who benefits?

"Second, Bitcoin is a criminal’s paradise. Professional criminals’ number one requirement is a secure, anonymous way to move and store money, and Bitcoin fits the bill perfectly. It’s no wonder Bitcoin is so popular among drug dealers, child pornographers, and extortionists. There’s also a booming business in Bitcoin theft as well."
What percentage of the $5.8 billion market cap is used for illicit purposes. What percentage of USD $20 bills have traces of cocaine on them? The Bitcoin = funders of crime argument is getting pretty stale.

The piper is coming to get paid in Alberta at least and probably Saskatchewan too. I'm interested in seeing how all the newly unemployed oil workers get their mortgages refinanced with only EI to show for income. The banks don't take beat up two year old Dodge Rams as collateral

The banking industry, of which r3cev is a part of, is not compatible with Bitcoin and the blockchain. The bank's attempts to integrate blockchain type infrastructure won't work because what's the incentive to use it? Who benefits? Why would the banks implement the technology the competes with their high-fee payment system already in place. Do they think miners are going to move their energy over to working the banks' blockchain?

I'm certainly moving a nonnegligeable part of my savings into Bitcoin. The CAD and the economy in general are in terrible shape and moving in the wrong direction. The housing bubble is certainly about to burst and we're staring down the barrel of negative interest rates. Unless you're invested in LAV manufacturing or pipeline lawsuits the only other logical investment is Bitcoin.

“I want to be in a professional environment again where people are grounded in some sort of business reality.”
Banking? The land of neoclassical economists? Good riddance.

Depending on where you are there could also be a Bitcoin ATM. Vancouver and Edmonton both have them.

Not one ship moving dry goods from port to port. That can't be good for business. That can't be good for anybody.

Just tried the atombit app. So far so good with PayPal exchange, just waiting for my BTC to arrive. Said up to 24hrs to process.
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:11:09
Atombit PayPal exchange is good! This is a game changer IMO

Also, how many startups in any sector will be around in 1 year or 5 years? Oil? Restaurants? Biotech? Robotics? Retail?

Not too long before the path of the USD follows that of Venezuela and Argentina. Not to mention Canada, Japan, South Africa... You get the picture.

That guy has some serious calories in front of him. A Danish, OJ and a coffee. If he knows diet like he knows Fintech...lookout!

Why are you so cheap might be a better way of phrasing it.
@_date: 2016-01-23 02:18:38
Right now Argentina, Venezuela and Ukraine appear to be prime candidates to run Bitcoin as their national currency.

If you have a paypal account try atombit. Not sure if it works in USA but def works in Canada.

The cryptsy thing totally sucks, but it's not an issue with the blockchain technology. A centralized, private entity failed.

A Bitcoin ATM is where you put your money in the machine in exchange for a slip of paper with the Bitcoin key on it for the amount you've purchased. You then enter that key into your digital wallet. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:02:24
You won't be crying about fees when your Bitcoin purchase doubles in value.
@_date: 2016-12-26 03:08:17
It also works the other way where you can enter your key and get cash.

Retirement savings? What are those? Citizens don't have savings anymore. Only debt.

That's exactly how it works. They are good if you don't want to give all your info to an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 00:42:36
Without miners there is no Bitcoin, bozo. Why don't all you bigger block enthusiasts develop your own blockchain that you can tweak and fork as much as you like. Obviously Bitcoin isn't for you.
@_date: 2016-09-21 18:47:46
Try atombit. Haven't used it in a while, but it was good when I did use it.

When you get a credit card, car loan, mortgage, line of credit, etc. the bank is indeed creating money out of nothing. They are not taking money from their profits, deposits or liabilities and placing it into an account for you. They are giving you a brand new account with freshly created fiat money that has never existed before. You then spend it into existence and have to find other money to pay them back with. In other words, Visa does not give you Visa's money to spend. The bank gives you a new digital account with new digital money in it and it could only ever cost them anything if you default.
