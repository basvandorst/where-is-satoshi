I am not sure about the reason but I think bitflyer is a big exchange for bitcoin in Japan. But the price in there is lower than in coinhub app. Therefore, the portfolio shows the wrong results. I guess it will be difficult to add the price for all different exchanges. Anyway, I think each exchange has their own app like bitflyer, for example, has its app on ios that shows daily, monthly, and yearly profit/loss. I just don't see how coinhub could replace that yet.

No one knows what will happen. We either ride it or ignore it. The train is moving anyway.

Similar thing happened to me. My bank waited too long to allow the transfer. I got so mad because the return would have been 50%. Now I don’t look at the price but I believe bitcoin is the future. So now I own 0.14 BTC and a little fraction of other crypto. I will wait and see how it plays out next year.

It already did. I bought it when it was 2 million yen last week. Until now, I still lose money though.
