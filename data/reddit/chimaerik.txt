Why wouldn't they accept a wire transfer?

Whoever created Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote the original white paper. That white paper is not in broken English and is absolutely brilliant.

I use Mycelium + BIP38 paper wallets as well.
Have .pdfs of my paper wallets backed up on an encrypted USB. 
Obviously if both the paper wallet AND the USB are compromised I'm SOL, but...

Sounds more like to me that your friend is using Bank of America's bill pay service. This is common with all banks, but it isn't a transfer of funds. It creates a check, instantly deducting the funds from the sender account, and then a check is mailed to the recipient. This has a 3-5 day delay. This is far different than instantly transferring money to someone's account/wallet.

Ken Olson's quote is out of context - he was referring to a central computer being rigged to operate the entire house; open doors, flush toilets, etc. He had a personal computer in his home and promoted the idea.

Man people were posting this same annoying shit at $900 a week and a half ago.
Put it in cold storage, wait, and shut the fuck up.

They would have the same success they had with banning p2p file sharing.

The processed payments would appear on your bank statement as USD. Your bookkeeper/accountant would handle it as usual from there.
What has changed?

You can pick up a fraction of a coin.
I bought my first 0.1 BTC off of Coinbase a couple of nights ago and I am really excited to get it! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:16:05
I like to think of Mt Gox's price as being from the future.
But in all reality it's probably the "premium" price for BTC, and may be overstated. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:40:38
LTC should be 3-15% of BTC conservatively, imo. It is just now approaching 3%, the low end of my conservative estimate. Does not seem overpriced to me at all. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:33:24
It is best to put it in cold storage.
One method is to save  offline onto a usb drive, and from an offline computer, generate/print your wallet. You can then send it straight there from Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:13:49
It's all speculation at this point, but I think it is not a bubble at all.. just peaks and valleys with an overall massive upward trend. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:13:56
YEEEEEEE HAAAAAWWWWWWW!!!!
It's not tampering, it's just a massive dump. Someone just sold out a book.
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:52:05
I know how desperately you want to see BTC drop, but you do not have 1k BTC to unload onto the markets, and even if you did, there have been multiple dumps today larger than that.
You are nothing but a dipshit troll. Have fun watching BTC hit new highs over and over again in the coming months.
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:36:45


Seriously, that's the guy's argument - your money might attain exponentially more purchasing power. Damn, sounds like a terrible investment.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:45:33
Litecoin is kicking ass lately... It has been mirroring Bitcoin's growth, and is now trading at over $35, 3% of one BTC. 
Why do altcoins offend BTC holders? They are not competitive.. they are complimentary. They are just as convenient to use, but Bitcoin will always be the original protocol. When Bitcoin rockets, they usually all rise. When Bitcoin hiccups, they usually all dive. 
They are all based on the same open-source protocol and the easiest way to buy any altcoin will always be with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:35:05
The trick is to be horrible at basic math and all around full of shit.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:52:23
Uhm, that's some expensive Red Bull. 
Merchants typically price in FIAT and market rate is used on purchase...
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:53:38


Hahahahaha... 
You are hilarious... pulling things out of your ass like that...
Again, historically, the only ones who lose money on bitcoin are those that panic sell. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:00:09
[They are working on it.](
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:36:00
People will continue to price goods in their respective FIAT, but at the time of transaction, the buyers BTC is converted at market value. With this from the merchant's perspective, it does not really matter if BTC is worth 100 or 100,000.
It will be decades before people start pricing their goods in BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:28:54
The buyer is still using bitcoin. All that matters as far as this subreddit is concerned. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:32:46
It's a lot more simple than that. The customer pays you through your Bitpay address and then it's exchanged to cash (if that's what you choose to do). Bitpay uses an exchange rate that is a market average, but it doesn't really matter for you, as you will receive whatever you price your products/services for. Then, there's a deposit automatically made at the end of the day to your bank account. 
But yeah, obviously if you truly believe in BTC for the long term you could always hold onto them as an investment. 
My point was the instant exchange completely eliminates the volatility risk that you mentioned being worried about..
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:09:01
Not all wallets enforce the minimum transaction fee and no transaction fee of any amount is actually required. If you send .0001 instead, it will get confirmed extremely fast. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:11:36
Take a breather. Go to sleep. Stop looking at the charts.
It's fine.

I agree. No posting history and his user name is "sadcoins".

I think Satoshi is perfect for the smallest unit. It's sort of like penny except one more syllable and a lot more awesome. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:35:14
Yeah, however if you do not authorize the charges you can obviously dispute them with your bank or credit agency... Not exactly a sound argument he's making in favor of bitcoin. 
In answer to your original question though, it seems to me like a solid hedge against FIAT currency, much like gold or silver. It should appreciate long-term, and has the potential to do it exponentially and quickly. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:11:01
If you use certain wallet applications, specifically Mycelium, you are actually able to send any amount you want from a paper wallet, and it automatically sweeps the change back into the paper wallet's address.
But to answer your original question, yes. You can send from any wallet to a paper wallet's address multiple times and/or from different wallets.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:36:08

guess the people upvoting just sorta understood/assumed what I meant, like you probably did.

2% fee is nothing compared to the fees required to get USD in and out of BTC-e.

I would like to point out that the bubble flash crash in April occurred over a matter of 1-2 days.

Alright, then you've set yourself up for two falsehoods:
1) Bitcoin will not be traded in the $1200.00 range ever again
and 
2) Bitcoin will be worth $0.00 by December 26, 2014.
I think you'll fail your first assumption by the end of the month.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:26:26
Awesome!! I love both Mycelium and BIP0038 cold storage paper wallets. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:34:45
It doesn't matter if it does.. there is no risk at all for the merchant.
Let's say I want to sell you $5.00 of balloons and you want to pay me in BTC. You would pay coinbase's current market price for BTC, and I would instantly get that BTC converted to $5.00, the same as if you were to pay me with cash.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:27:19
It's getting a little better.
It used to be every time there was a sudden price drop, you'd have this posted [here a few times]( with an arrow pointed usually at "denial" or "return to 'normal'."

One second, let me get out my crystal ball.
It is highly volatile. If you want in, get in, but expect a ride. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:56:34
Accounting does not change at all if using Bitpay/Coinbase, as mentioned. Primary source document remains the bank statement which records the BTC payments as USD deposits the same as if you were paid any other way. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:53:30
I think your assessment is laughably bad.
I am commenting now so that I can look back when BTC is hitting all time highs again and chuckle a bit more. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:11:22
The templates in OP's picture were printed from bitaddress.org, and when they are encrypted with BIP38 they are blue instead of orange/yellow. But alright.

2 shows a very limited understanding on constitutional law. 
The constitution gives congress the power to print money, but they turned that over to the Fed a century ago. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:13:58
No merchant need accept any risk in exchange rate volatility. They can accept BTC and have it instantly exchanged for FIAT upon transaction. So this leaves the question of why wouldn't Amazon, eBay, or any other merchant/third party vendor site (fuck Paypal), accept BTC, since it's as good as money, and likely saving them on merchant service fees?
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:33:10
They are blue because they are encrypted.
Exactly the same except they will require the encrypted password if you try to use the funds.
Think so. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:26:38
I keep saying this but here it goes again.. seems like a lot of BTC holders feel threatened by altcoins without realizing that the easiest way to purchase them is with BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:15:10
On your [Form 1040 Schedule D]( you indicate both proceeds (amount collected) and cost (amount paid).

Talk about sweeping generalizations...
I am a LTC holder and I have other altcoins. Stop feeding the trolls.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:29:11
One option is to use  offline by saving it to a usb, connecting to an offline PC, and then generate/print the paper wallet from there. 
Apparently it generates the keys using a script from your PC and is safe and secure.

No, you can use 3rd party sites like OKPAY or Egopay to get it in there, but again, fees.

You've probably seen the words "pump and dump" being thrown around. What you are describing is exactly that. When someone unloads a massive amount of BTC onto the market, they are dumping. When they start buying it all back up, it's called pumping.

Because they went from 800 to 900 within 5 minutes. It was an insanely intense moment. This guy probably thought it was "going to the moon" and he should get in before 1300 is the new normal.
He's not even in a bad position now. As long as he doesn't require that $900.00 or whatever he invested for daily living and doesn't do something absolutely stupid like sell, he will be laughing about all of this in 3 weeks.

BTC-E has a much smaller market, and has fees for deposit/withdrawal. 
There's your reason.
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:46:53
Sorry, but no matter how much you may believe that, the purchasing power of BTC is always going to be important to a lot of people.
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:25:41
I would try it, but the miner fees and I'm cheap... haha 
Thank you, though!
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:47:16
Yup, exactly.
I do not think most people realize that by and large the easiest way to attain altcoins is by exchanging BTC for them. Therefore, they are not really in any competition with BTC, but are actually complimentary. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:21:17
This shouldn't be a worry as a vendor as long as you use Bitpay or Coinbase.
You can elect the option to instantly exchange bitcoin to FIAT upon transaction. So if you are selling $50.00 of goods, you'll get $50.00, but someone will have used BTC to buy them.
So yeah, accept some bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:16:56
You realize BTC is still up ~ $60.00 for the day right?
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:07:03
Nothing stopping you. If you can find a buyer for less than you paid, all the power to you.

@_date: 2013-12-01 22:48:48
Historically, the only people that have lost money on BTC are those who failed to hold and panic sold.
But yeah, that meme shit is annoying.

This has the exact same point of failure. The best script/software can ever achieve is pseudo-random.

Do not click it / ignore them. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:35:42
That's my point though, with the instant exchange feature, this risk does not exist.
Also integration could not possibly be easier from what I am seeing. Sign up for coinbase, print online wallet's QR address, done.
