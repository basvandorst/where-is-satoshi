I need to figure out a way to describe it to others. If I cant describe it in terms they understand it comes off like a cult or scheme. We need a "teach others bitcoin 101" so we can share it without the scary terms. Cryptography was just too cold war sounding for my mother to handle.

I had been thinking of a bet I made there for over a year that concluded in February. I didn't pay attention to the site for a long time so I was  upset after finally winning my bet to discover that the operator had been MIA since November and I wasn't getting my winnings. ~0.17 btc lost is not huge now but when I made the bet my 0.1 btw was only worth ~$1 20.

It's a shame, isn't it? I really like the concept of the hard wallet but I've been burned by them before so I won't even bother. To think I sent them 5 BTC in the past for a delayed and late jalapeno makes me nauseous. It's clearly a company that maximizes profit on outdating pre orders than it cares about delivering on promises. I'm drunk so this might not make sense but I'm mad anyway. Rabble, rabble, fist raising.

They eventually deliver so its not a scam. They're a horrible company to deal with and really shitty at customer service but... their products ship. It sucks to wait for an investment that loses value every day but the  possibility should be in consideration when thinking of doing businesses with them.

I tried the rpi route and found it difficult. I'm a complete Linux noob so if my experience varied from the guide I was following I was screwed. 
That being said, I discovered rokos.space and used that instead. It comes with 0.13.1 pre-installed so you add a hard drive and you're good to go. I had previously run my node on a Windows pc so I was able to boot strap so I can't comment on the initial block download time but I heard it's several weeks.

They're pretty upfront about this on their site.  Use a different site if you don't agree with the terms. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 05:24:33
Thats very true. My distaste for the word comes from feeling the word anonymous carries a negative connotation and I wish they would use a more neutral way to describe it, like P2P or internet currency. Semantics!

I think you can configure your recurring purchase to send to the same address each time so you won't have to move them manually.

To add on to this, no self respecting person comparing btc to gold would use the price of an ounce. It's all about market cap.

That's what he's saying, that the massive price swing at 9am EST was evidence insiders know it's not happening.

Big blocks mean small miners with fewer resources (bandwith, no private relay network) are at a disadvantage and are more likely to create orphaned blocks. This encourages miners to work closely together (centralize) and opens the door to essentially remove small miners from the network. Once only a few miners remain they can double spend, censor by raising fees against specific addresses or blacklsiting. This is called a resource exhaustion attack.

"predicting the market correctly" dude you're full of shit. If you were so good at this you would have planned ahead to have the cash ready across multiple exchanges to limit failure points. The fact that you chose an exchange that has a reputation for strict kyc and quick trigger security measures means you're not as smart as you think. 
Simply put, you didn't plan appropriately and you're blaming others for your oversights and incompetence. Put your money on an exchange where this wasn't a possibility and you could rolling around in your new future. Take it from a guy who sent some coins to Mt. Gox because "it's the biggest, must be the best". I haven't blamed anyone but myself because when I sent my coins there the writing was on the wall. You should have known better than to send a bunch of money out of nowhere to Coinbase. You're the one to blame here. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:59:12
There was no way to better research this? You surprised coinbase with a load of cash out of nowhere. You said yourself you didn't have money for a while so this is unusual behavior for your account according to coinbase. Same IP, same telephone line, it doesn't matter. Your coinbase account deviated from an established pattern and that matters at this exchange. 
And if you did so correctly predict the market, why not take out a loan  so you have time in case a hiccup like this happens? Or send your money to btc-e and cash out on a prepaid card minus the fee? Your bold prediction would make you enough money to cover that fee and you wouldn't have to deal with the headaches of an American exchange. 
YOU messed up dude. Own it, learn from it, and take your lump sums elsewhere. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:46:08
No, because the number of units aren't equal. There are more ounces of gold than there are coins therefore they're not comparable. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 02:18:35
And if you reread my comment you'll see my point is that if he is waiting to spend a bunch of money when he gets the opportunity he should have done his due diligence and not put it on coinbase. You're asking for attention if you suddenly put large sums of money in your account at that site. He had the time to research more appropriate exchanges and he fucked up. Start from the top and read my post again.

I remember this! Let me fill you in. 
A user had made a claim that his trading strategy was infallible: he sold when prices went up because they will go back down, and bought when prices went down because they will go back up. His logic was the perfect antithesis of the popular disclaimer "Past performance is no guarantee of future results".

To be frank, before you dive in just pay attention to the next 48 hours and see if you're still interested. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 00:11:09
Your position makes two assumptions: that ETH will go up and BTC will go down. This is stupid because you're claiming that the prices are cyclical and predictable.

Remember, even if something happens to your Ledger you can still recover all of your coins if you enter your mnemonic phrase into a compatible wallet like multibit. Your coins are always safe unless you lose control of that backup phrase. No need to worry otherwise :) 
@_date: 2016-12-27 00:56:29
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This is like, Investing 101. Are you buying LTC? I heard they're down lately and according to your logic they WILL go back up. In crypto-land the falling knives are extra sharp, do be careful!
@_date: 2016-11-15 02:42:59
I keep the Ledger around the house and the seed in a safe deposit box. If you don't trust a safe deposit box then get a cryptosteel and hide it in your home separate from your trezor.

It sounds like you disagree with the actual coding of the segwit, can you elaborate why? I don't understand why a change like that is considered a hack.

They probably don't want to do business with you for the same reason they closed your first account.

It's been a while since I used multibit but there would be an option somewhere to load or sweep a wallet where you would then enter your phrase. 
Can't help with Ubuntu, sorry, I use the Ledger app on my chromebook.

It's misleading to say unlimited needs 51% to activate but represent their hash rate combined with classic in the pie chart. Even if the difference is minimal you should separate them or remove classic from the chart entirely.

I think there are soft fork related technical issues that makes it important to have a vast majority of miners segwit compatible. Something about accidental hard forks? Sorry I'm on mobile I can't find where I read that.

Coinbase isn't *unsafe* it's just a better idea to control your own private keys. If you leave your coins in control of an exchange like coinbase you're trusting them to keep your coins safe from hacks, theft, insolvency, etc. There are inherent risks with handling your own keys as well so I recommend reading about wallets and backups before moving your coins anywhere. 
If you're new to bitcoin and don't need to access your coins at a moments notice the vault can be a good option. I used it in the past before getting a hardware wallet.
