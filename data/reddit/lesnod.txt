Did you read my statement or just pick out Obama and decided to get ultra defensive? I said 'during Obama's years' nut job!

Then why is it you think I'm blaming Obama and not the fed? You don't realize the fed is it's own entity? Or do you just not understand sentence structure? Or maybe you don't care about any of that and as I said.... Are overly defensive about Obama!

No, I got all of mine out, once they were in freewallet I had no problems exchanging then to btc and moving them to coinbase.

Wow, that's both amazing and great.

Are you in the US? I have two of my cards 'confirmed'/verified with them but neither one of the cards is allowing withdrawal. Please advice what country you are in.

Are your ltc stuck in vircurex?

You actually withdrew btc without converting them to doge?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:40:16
I managed to get mine out.

No, the reference to Obama is a time frame, you're just over sensitive and defensive. You interpret it with assumptions! Put your silly defensiveness aside and as you state it..... don't flame!
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:22:43
Yeah, I would try to move them using dogecoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:18:25
I can't anyway unless I move them to coinbase and lose money. I have bounced between dollars and btc in an attempt to get dollars out of cex and I can't withdraw.

I don't see cryptocurrency as the cause of hyperinflation. The dollar has it's own problems with or without crypto. The banks are still holding trillions of all the money the fed printed during Obama years. I think it's only a matter of time before that money starts to hit the open market and watch inflation go.... crypto might add to some of that, but the problems the dollar have aren't caused by crypto.

I exchanged them to dogecoin, then was able to move the dogecoins to freewallet.io, then exchanged them back into btc. It took a few transfers to freewallet because I didn't want to bring any attention to myself since China shut down exchanges. So I kept my dogecoin transfers under 100k and just did it several times.
