This post inescapably implies that Bitcoin will plateau in its 30's, hit the wall, then go into terminal decline.

thank you for disabusing me of my ignorance on the matter -_-

We can use quantum entanglement as a faster-than-light speed network for transmitting bitcoin tx across massive distances [ It'll just be...unfathomably impractical and expensive :)

Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for yourself
@_date: 2019-07-23 08:16:13
Yeah, you can, theoretically. The particles need to become entangled by being physically close together, then can be physically transported a great distance apart, then are able to be used as single-use, one-way, faster-than-light communication. So technically possible, but extraordinarily unfeasable

Right now the only killer app is as a non-sovereign store of value, which can't be inflated beyond the already agreed upon schedule, and can't be censored, and doesn't require KYC, which is a pretty big value proposition given the daily onslaught of news on fiat &amp; bank missteps.
That being said, the number of Bitcoin ATMs, the Ethereum ecosystem (especially Eth 2.0 with staking &amp; sharding), privacy coins, and other experiments in smart contracts and other coins/chains are consistently growing. Other auspicious developments include FB &amp; Libra pushing mass adoption which will educate the masses on how to use crypto, small or economically challenged countries like Bulgaria/Belarus/Palestine/Venezuela showing increased interest in crypto, more exchanges coming online daily (like Norwegian airlines wtf) which improves liquidity (and DEXes which provide liquidity without compromising security) and in particular, Samsung planning to put embedded crypto hardware wallets into their phones - which means in a couple years EVERYONE will have a secure hardware crypto wallet they can use for payments and funds storage.
It's like any exponential trend that at first starts out imperceptibly small, then progressively gains momentum and suddenly explodes.
Again though, Bitcoin itself will be too slow &amp; expensive to buy your morning coffee with. So people will regularly transfer their BTC into other currencies for daily spending (EUR, USD, Libra, or other fast but inflationary &amp; centralized shitcoin du jour), and transfer back to BTC for long term saving. So for purchasing a house, a car, an island, or for international settlements between sovereign entities, those will all be great use cases :)

We actually do have an option. There are just presumed negative side effects to availing of that option.

Ray Dalio really panders to central bankers throughout the book, validating their role in "easing" crises.  I suspect he has a macroeconomic predictive model where he can capitalize on the predictable market fluctuations caused by central bankers' manipulation and tomfoolery in the markets. He wants to encourage more of their interference in the market because it creates inefficiencies he can take to the bank.

This is the quality comment I subscribed for.

Very cool, hadn't seen SoloKey before

We know that inflation is a form of discreet wealth confiscation, but there's another very large form of wealth confiscation which is not talked about: the fact that the tax basis of assets are not adjusted up for inflation, so you pay capital gains tax on the NOMINAL but not the REAL increase in value of an asset.
1. You buy a stock for $1000.
2. You hold it for a year, and in that year, inflation is 5%
3. The price (but not the value) of the stock goes up to $1050, not because the company increased in value, but just because of inflation.
4. Now you sell the stock at $1050. The capital gains is $50, but you haven't actually made any money, it's just that the value of the USD has gone down in that time, so the stocks nominal valuation in USD has gone up, and now you have to pay capital gains on the $50. So if capitals gains tax is %20, then the tax paid by you is $10. 
5. So in all of this, you lost $10/$1050, which is \~1% of the value of your original investment. 
6. Now imagine this happening for billions and billions of dollars of investments made by millions of people over decades.

Not in the foreseeable future, but their role in the economy will change over time. Think about this: the Church as an over-arching system of control over European society once had totalitarian control, but eventually lost it. Now here we are 500 years later, and churches are still around, but they have way less power, less authority, more competition, and can be safely ignored.  Banks will be around for a long time to come, but instead of being essential, they'll become more and more quaint, and will be forced to compete on quality and value.

Look, at this point Peter Schiff is just a troll who's playing a nocoiner on TV to  get more airtime for himself.

Let me correct that for him: Bitcoin is a ~~Monument~~ Epitaph to Irrationality.
The fiat game of uncontrolled inflation, systemic counter-party risk, massive funding of war...that all sounds more irrational than:
A 100% open, verifiable, secure, censorship resistant, opt-in system with constantly decreasing inflation.

Using it as a savings account is one thing to do with it. I like to think of it as a strong store of value with a risk profile completely orthogonal to the traditional financial system.

Maybe there's room for the development of Layer 2 solutions which have facilities for arbitration built in before final settlement in BTC.

Authy has a backup feature, so you could switch to that from Google Authenticator before you change phones.  And I would HIGHLY recommend using Yubikey for 2FA as soon as you can transition to it (and if the service supports it). It's vastly more secure than Google Auth or Authy for a few reasons.

Read the Bitcoin Standard. Its discussion on Time Preference is enlightening.

Soon we will realize Bitcoin is incredibly stable, perhaps one of the most stable systems ever. It churns out blocks every 10 minutes (on average), day in, day out, sorting out the real transactions from the fraudulent ones. It's like a monetary clock. It is only everything external to Bitcoin (which causes its exchange rate in terms of euros and dollars to fluctuate) that makes it appear artificially volatile :)

Obviously gold supply is far less elastic than other goods, but still its production has significantly increased after its huge price run up in the last 15 years: [ In fact gold supply continued to increase even in years where the price went down (like 2013)

That's a very insightful point.

If/when Ethereum deploys 1. Proof of Stake and 2. Sharding, its price per token will EXPLODE. If they don't deliver those features for the network, its price will just be meh indefinitely.
