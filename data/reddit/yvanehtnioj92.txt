That may be true, but better to have 3 than 0..

Okay, maybe I screwed up my question a bit! I wanted to know when the last bitcoin will be mined?

Dogecoin 2.0

I like using Kraken and seeing all the complaints about the other platforms, it's pretty solid!

Leading up to august, everything will fall, after it everything will bounce back uo.

I agree blockchain will be the future of banking, but to be honest the keynsian policy of kickstarting the economy isn't that crazy! Imo printing money beats severe cut backs from the government!

As much as I agree with you, I don't think jailing banksters and credit raters and redistributing their wealth would have a significant positive effect on the economy, nor would it be a realistic option for a big political party in charge who wants to keep the support of the big capital.
However, confronting the cons (and big capital in general) with the consequences of their actions, excluding them from the financial world and making them work towards a juster economy is something that needs to be considered, since they just seem to get away with everything they do.

Wow, 14.5 is really high! I would suggest looking for other trading platforms.
With regards to your question on the btc fork, I would wait a bit. Nobody seems to know how the markets will react. I myself pulled out for a while and will try to buy back in if a major dip occurs.
Good luck!

Dude, i know what inflation is. I don't say printing money is an ideal situation, but if you look at what austerity measures did to the economies of southern Europe, maybe inflatory measures to try and kickstart the economy are the lesser of two evils.

TakeAway has a history of accepting bitcoin in other countries.
Great thing they are involved in the cryptoworld, although it's a bit weird to pay for a 15eur pizza with Btc :-)
