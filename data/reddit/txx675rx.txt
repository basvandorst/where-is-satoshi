After seeing this i stopped by my local grocery store &amp; bought $10 worth. Very easy &amp; fast. Having to KYC kinda sucks but whatever. All in all pretty cool to be able to buy a little BTC anytime i go to the grocery store. Also, quoted prices was about 6% over spot &amp; there was a 4% fee. But for $10 worth i didn't mind
