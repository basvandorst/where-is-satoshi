Sell orders go all the way from current price up to 30-ish.  Buy orders go from current price down to 0-ish.  You can see where standing orders fall on Mt.Gox by looking at their Depth of Market chart or table.  This doesn't include their 'dark pools' though.

I also heard a rumor that someone who runs computing for a major GPU-based genetics research facility decided to use all their idle machines to enrich himself. *shrug*

Best bet is to only move your coins/USD into the exchange as you need to make a trade, them immediately move the result out after a trade, no matter which one you're using.  But why give Mt.Gox more commission money after they have proven how much they suck?  I would much rather support their competition until they prove themselves equally incompetent (which they may be!)

Actually they are no longer listing bank transfers as a withdrawal method, I guess they changed their policy on this.  I am pretty sure that both MtGox and Tradehill will do direct bank transfers if you you are moving enough money, though.  I have seen other people mention that they have done this, it just requires interacting with their support folks.

When using a CPU for mining there is a very good chance that you are paying more for the power you're using than you are getting from the mining pool.  It's definitely not worth it unless you have decent GPUs to use for the task.

You will certainly get a much better price building your own rig.  The value of this service is that it's all already put together for you and set up with all the software you need, plus some scripts to monitor it for you.
BTW you would probably also want some extra cooling if you plan to run four 5830s in one case like this.
Full disclosure:  I am the guy who runs the site that is linked to in this thread.

I sell things for bitcoins on a website.  What I do is set the price based on the current exchange rate at the time of sale.  When I receive payment I immediately sell the bitcoins for USD.  So far the minor price fluctuations in that short window between payment being confirmed and the time I sell have worked to my advantage, but it could go either way.  It takes about an hour to move the bitcoins around, so there is some risk involved.

Any GPU you would want to use for mining is going to take up two slots,  so three of those PCIE slots would be wasted.  Back-to-back GPUs running full bore will also create a serious heat problem.

You can transfer BTC directly to any bitcoin address, including the one Tradehill gives you to make a deposit.  They don't have to pass through your wallet.

Mt.Gox offers a free merchant service that makes it very easy to accept Bitcoins, very similar to the PayPal 'Buy Now' button.  See 
But if she just wants to convert it back to USD it will be a hassle to keep the BTC prices current with the exchange rate.

Block Explorer shows that we're still getting a new block about every five minutes right now, even after the difficulty increase.  That's about twice what we should be seeing right after a difficulty jump.  This is for real, not just a reporting problem.

I am leaving nothing on Mt.Gox and not trading with them any more.  They failed hardcore and then lied to us about what happened.  I don't trust them and I don't want to give them more of my money after what happened.

In a nutshell you're trying to create a hash value that is less than a particular target value, which is very small compared to the number of bits in the hash.  You generate a hash by running some data through a couple rounds of SHA256.  That data consists of the header from the last block generated on the bitcoin network, some info unique to your particular node, and a 'nonce' that increments every time you try a new hash.  You get the data you need for hashing by participating in the bitcoin network.  You can do this directly or through a pool which consolidates many people's hashing power.  Since the data you need for hashing changes frequently you need to be connected to the internet.
Essentially this is a lottery system.  Everyone generating a hash has the same odds of finding one that is under the current target value (also known as the network's current 'difficulty').  The more hashing power you throw at it the more chances you have every second of generating one of the 'magic' hashes that wins you bitcoins.
The purpose underlying bitcoin mining is the generation of 'blocks', which are permanent records of recent bitcoin transactions.  This is how bitcoin payments are processed.  When a miner 'solves' a block by coming up with a hash less than the target value that miner earns the right to publish the block to the block chain, and that miner also receives any processing fees people paid to have their transactions prioritized, in addition to the 50 BTC reward generating the block.
The bitcoin network's goal is to generate one of these transaction-verifying blocks every ten minutes.  In order to keep the timing right the network has to make it more difficult to generate blocks when it sees that they are being added too quickly.  This is where 'difficulty' comes into play.  In order to counteract the effects of more and more people mining, the network makes the target value for hashes lower and lower, such that the odds of finding the magic hash decrease in proportion to how many hashes are being attempted.  This adjustment happens every time 2000 or so more blocks are generated.  This is supposed to take a couple of weeks, but due to the exponential growth of the network we are really outpacing that considerably right now.  You can find a chart that tracks it here:
A good place to start learning how things work technically with blocks and the block chain is here:  
Adding more power to the network does eventually result in increased difficulty for everyone.  This isn't something you should feel bad about though, it's just a fact of how the system works.  The fact that you have a lot of power at your disposal gives you a big advantage over most people, but asking you not to use that is like asking you not to open a new business that competes with existing ones in an established marketplace.  It's a race to the bottom here, do your worst.
BTW I'm pretty sure there are other people in your situation (genetics computing labs, etc) already using their spare cycles to mine.  There are major spikes in hashing power from time to time and this seems like the simplest explanation for why that much power is added and removed from the network on a regular basis.

As I understand it nonce should be incremented every time you try a hash.  The changing nonce is what gives you different hash values each time you try.  Target is just the value you need to come in under, it isn't going to change unless the difficulty level changes.
I'm basing this on the first paragraph on this page:

$7M is _nothing_ to a major bank.  And Fed member banks, who basically control our entire economic framework, would not hesitate to take over this newfangled cryptocurrency at such bargain prices just to have the option to kill it.

Correct, my prices are based on dollars, not bitcoins.  But I am 'selling for bitcoins' in that I accept them for payment.  The fact that the price is pegged to the dollar is a consequence of the price instability with bitcoins that you mention, as well as the fact that I have to buy my parts to produce the product in dollars.
However, I think this is a good first step towards more widespread acceptance of bitcoins, which I really am trying to promote.  We have to start somewhere.

TradeHill will deposit to a bank account, they have a staggering number of way to withdraw:  
Volume is still pretty low there but it would be nice to support them so we aren't effectively limited to a single exchange.

It takes about an hour for the transaction to be confirmed (meaning it shows up in enough new blocks to be considered valid).  MtGox doesn't place the bitcoins in my account until that happens, so I can't sell them until then.  That is where the bitcoin -&gt; dollar conversion takes place.

This is definitely the easiest way to go.  I used Mt.Gox merchant services  on my site (bitminer.us) and it works well.  You will probably want the advanced callback API though if you want to know when you actually get paid.
BTW I have it set up to do an automatic calculation of the exchange rate too, PM me if you need help.
