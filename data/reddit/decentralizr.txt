Yes restoring will get your existing seed to copay (if the same 12 words been used)
Extra security? I don't know but consider a multisig 2-3 on copay. That's better security
@_date: 2018-01-14 04:08:57
Bitcoin is a lot of things. Surely also a good investment. But it is more important a new form of decentralized money. No more banks, no one who can cheap or hold your money. This alone is a reason to go into bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:55:31
Happy Birthday Nick
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:45:15
Better everything? Like in codebase? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:32:03
Many of the tech in Alts go into bitcoin! Alts is a good thing! And different use case as well! We talk alt not shitcoins! Many are shit indeed
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:14:14
You believe all what is posted on Facebook? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:30:02
It’s not if! It’s when!
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:24:18
Korean exchanges start KYC not shutting down. I would love to see more people using decentralized exchanges tho. I have my eye on altcoin.io when it launches
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:33:28
Just you
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:22:18
If they don’t put it in, they. Any manipulate the outcome. So I doubt they just bet on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:50:43
Haha not sure if that is allowed in the bitcoin Reddit. It’s bitcoin not altcoin after all! But if you ask me, I am hodl particl and ark. Both should have an insane year of they deliver what they promise.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:17:50
Well then hop on. Never ask where your sit is on the spaceship.. just hop on and enjoy the ride
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:38:43
Sure they shut it down how? You understand how decentralisation work?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:45:11
Check copay what is simple. Write down the 24 words and keep it at a safe place. There are many other options, but for a noob that one should be easy. If you have a lot invested consider buying trezor.io as a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:37:25
I am with you, but I doubt we go that deep. 8-9k is my bet. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:48:40
Start with any other coin but bitcoin! You need to spend a lot of money to actually make money mining!
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:06:50
Mine was 5 days it’s cleared a few hours ago. So there is hope yours come soon
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:53:16
It’s 22600 in Korea 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:52:22
Ah ripple? I don’t do shitcoins so again... not my money run. I am happy for the people who make money. But I stay as far away from ripple as from my local bank 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:33:15
Yes I tried it and yes crypto pro is way better and doesn’t crash so often
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:21:04
Blockfolio, bitcoin pro, bitcoin ticker..
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:16:30
You are right and bitcoin is only up 260% in 3 month and only 63% in 30 days that coin almost dies... it’s a healthy correction what is needed to go higher. Remember the dip to 5500 was the end of the big bitcoin rise and people needed to get real... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:58:52
And yeh we could always go to the atm and get cash right? We also wouldn’t have real world problems
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:47:22
Nope! 
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:11:55
There was news from Korea what turned out to be fake... that caused the dip. Chill will go back up in no time
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:33:08
You can use trezor to safe all your passwords it’s a chrome based extension tho. But very safe as you need the hardware wallet to unlock your passwords 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:09:29
This question gets posted very day a few times. Jump on board of you are in for a long ride or hope for a drop (could but maybe way higher happen) if you are in for the quick turn around.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:17:28
Nothing wrong with kitties �� 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:12:39
I read the same question at 10k and 11k. Depend what you want. Are in in for the long ride or quick bucks? If for the long ride then jump on board
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:09:04
Nope I git one ledger and one trezor and paid in btc 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:16:34
From 100k all the way down to 78k! Then take the 100k! This might look for people who don’t understand crypto like a bubble. But it is mass adoption and awareness what drives the price and we are not even started!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:41:23
I recommend to use a hardware wallet (if you have not to much bitcoin at least into a wallet you control and not a website based wallet)
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:07:22
Did you consider writing them as I doubt they check Reddit all day long
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:43:12
I do what I always do at a new ATH. I have a drink a cigar and say “I love bitcoin”
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:06:12
Everything can get hacked. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:28:32
What makes you believe it’s “the Asians” I live in one of “the Asian countries” and we hold our bitcoins here! Not a single “Asia” I know got into Ripple what is the bankers coin. And we don’t do banks or bankers coins here ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:51:55
Of course but only with a 5% premium. Everyone knows aliens are more litecoin people 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:12
So you say the dip from 8900 to 5500 was not the same. Chill this is crypto. If you can’t handle a 40% drop you should enjoy the 600% rise. I am chilled regardless if everyone panics 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:36:41
It has gone into almost every bitcoin story or movie told so far
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:33:01
The fee is never fixed so you need to check what is best at the moment of sending. Usually the app or website should tell you what is best at the moment. Trezor is super safe and if you lose it you can just restore with the 24 recovery words. So your coins will be safe! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:00:15
Where can I buy bitcoin for 10k link please and I am buying! In case that answer your question
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:19:39
That’s what actually drives the price. Mass adoption in Korea and Japan
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:12:35
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:19:39
IPs locked? Nice try lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:21:54
If you are in for the ride don’t wait! I read this same question since $40 per bitcoin. Jump on board you don’t need someone to tell you the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:56:53
Yes pump and dump sounds good! But high, sell low
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:53:27
Yes the question is why would you have ripple? Just to make money? It’s a make the owners rich scam! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:39:42
Well and no one gives a fuck about someone on Facebook 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:50:58
Nah... still happy with the price. If anyone would have promised at the beginning of 2017 that bitcoin is 12k at the end of the year.. we all would have signed it
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:57:21
Crashed since you got in right? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:02:06
We supposed to pop at 10k! We will not pop at 20k! I say we go from 100k all the way to 78k down and that’s the pop... regardless what people call it.. its adoption and awareness what drives the price
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:37:42
Just a guess on what I have seen since I joined. I can’t predict the future, but I am confident this is the beginning of even more adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:26:36
Ah don’t bother! Roger is not even worth talking about him anymore. The bitcoin Judas as he is called around here
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:54:19
I don’t mind. I stake (proof of stake or even dpos) check particl.io and ark.io 
I do good with both
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:49:11
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:09:51
To bcash! Yes dump! To bitcoin hodl! To 10-12 on different exchanges? I see 12k all over except Korea what is a bit higher
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:41:44
Works fine for me. Make sure you have 2fA setup and be verified and you will be able to withdraw up to 100 btc a day
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:08:22
Well I believe American exchanges all ask for that. So you don’t have much choices. Maybe coinbase? But I think they ask also for it
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:34:43
LOL 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:00:48
Many people had a bad feeling about bitcoin. Bitcoin died 200x! ;) and yet..
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:35:17
Such fud so bullshit! Get a life bro
@_date: 2018-09-02 00:54:32
American hand egg (or as you like calling it football) is only played in America..  the rest of the world has football (soccer) and that started too.. so I agree the season kicks in 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:44:22
Bitcoin is real money fiat isn’t 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:24:27
Yes if you can arbitrage that fast! Then try it. Bitcoin is not the fastest coin on earth and prices could catch up within minutes. Just saying
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:58:28
I read this kinda questions every day. In the end the question you need to answer is.. are you in for a quick $10 profit or in for the long ride. If you believe in crypto and in bitcoin does it matter if you pay 10% more or less? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:43:40
Ah ok.. ripple is to centralzied so I never wanted anything to do with it. Ark sounds good, is low.. I am a big fan of ark and part, but yet no financial advice and surely not on altcoins hehe. Good luck tho. FYI I git more ark this morning
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:35:54
Openbazarre and soon particl.io
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:25:28
Depend on the country you are in. I can pay almost everything here with bitcoin and if not... I get another option and deny my business
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:10:37
Each exchange has a different exchange rate. Coinmarket is average of all exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:24:53
I am very sceptic! You do not need KYC or ID verification but deal with PayPal? They close your account faster as you can blink! Hope you run a legitimate and not a scam business and if you run a legitimate business I hope for you that PayPal not close your account
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:25:27
That’s fair enough I guess
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:54:35
Yes at the moment at the bear trap at he awareness phase
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:54:54
Could be! Damn you might be right

@_date: 2017-12-09 02:24:48
You try to buy lower and fud the spirit lol. I don’t see us going that low
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:18:11
In a bubble maybe, but it doesn’t mean the bubble will bust anytime soon.. we been in a bubble multiple times. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:10:45
Well what coins are you talking about... it’s like asking I want a blond hooker, usually have the red head. Is it a good move? How do they look like and how good they are kinda thing
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:18:31
The Brezel is pretty cool tho
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:31:13
Fantastic a RIP post! Time to buy! That’s the signal. As seen 300+ times
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:08:56
Yes this shit is as low as 3 days ago ath lol
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:56:09
1. Always have your coins on your own wallet! An exchange is like a bank and therefore can be hacked, can run with your coins etc. 
2. If you have it in your own wallet you can claim your bcash and bitcoin gold. As you own the key. You don’t relay on an exchange to give them to you
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:43:11
Talk for yourself. I have no bank account anymore and don’t want any
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:59:19
And you need to buy more btc;) media start fighting us.. my mother ask after many years of telling her about bitcoin how she gets in.. we are at the awareness phase and this is just getting started
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:33:36
I been there and hodl and guess what paid out
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:43:49
For anonymity check monero, particl or dash. First two are the best options

It probably will! We are at the smart money stage now
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:16:13
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:17:53
So you feel it’s time to go back into fiat? Because fiat loses 2% purchasing power per year and you feel safer in the money what loses value as the one what just made you some? Sounds like a plan ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:48:59
Just pick up man and tell her you love her! And she needs to calm! Tomorrow sure reads again price is up
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:31:11
Sure! Stick with fiat then. I take the “risk” I took since 2012! No regrets
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:42:41
I didn’t see it as I don’t do Facebook
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:48:42
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:13:32
You mean fiat keeps gaining like the 2% they lose very year? Lol fiat bubble is busted regardless what they print! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:11:31
CME is what drives it? What you talking about 10th and strong opposition? Isn’t it the 18th when that CME guys start?
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:05:16
The founders
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:20:56
Still I don’t see why we would crash about that. More people will be coming and joining bitcoin. Japan and Korea is getting more and more real world use for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:00:23
Then buy!
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:24:54
If you can afford to take the risk and willing to do so, do it! It might be risky but you are young! I went all in years ago and took the risk. Happy camper now. But again this is not meant to be a financial advice! There is risk and as long you can afford the risk.. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:42:52
Thank you! For all the hard data’s to back that claim up. I predict a crash from 98k all the way down to 87k in the future. Let’s see how is right 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:57:45
Give me your bank account and send it to my bitcoin address. Nah kidding bro, if you really have that much and have no idea how to cash it out.. I recommend to not listen to others and learn about bitcoin and you figure things out yourself. It’s your money, so learn about it. Including cashing out
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:06:39
Trap! We go up! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:52:38
You mean like the 10k dip?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:44:03
I don’t care. I am not a fiat guy so I literally don’t care! 1btc is 1btc and will stay that way
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:25:52
I dumped bcash! If that answer your question
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:24:47
Copay 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:55:13
Yes you are right we are only 43.2% up since 4 weeks ago! So yes very scary times... you must be new man. Chill, switch your computer off.. read a book. Enjoy life. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:18:44
Haha who is backing bitcoin you have a note.. you mean the once your government took away was it 500 and 1000 what you can’t use anymore? Enjoy your government backed notes man, you cracked me up. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:49:29
I have both. Ledger is better with altcoins. Trezor has the password vault as well. I use trezor mostly
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:56:17
It’s 21k in Japan and 23k in Korea 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:56:57
It died so many times.. but 2040 won’t be the year hehe 2140 is more accurate and until then it’s so high and electric is free. We will all have pocket miners and secure the network with just being on the network..

@_date: 2017-12-19 07:53:30
People discover bitcoin, then looking for the next bitcoin to make millions! If there is a bubble it’s the altcoin bubble! Bitcoin and maybe 5-10 other crypto currencies will be winners in 2018 the rest could see some really ugly dumps
@_date: 2018-09-18 08:58:29
You mean porn or prostitution? I guess yes but that's one strange question man
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:12:08

I am in as long as you claim.. I do well and hodl happy as usual
@_date: 2018-09-09 02:18:10
It's all combined.. bitcoin was coming into light in the last financial crisis and it shined everytime we had shit hitting the fan.. in Greece, Cyprus..  and yes Venezuela and Zimbabwe.. Argentina..  look at the prices of btc in this countries. Bitcoin is here to help in situations when printing more money to have more money don't do it anymore
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:07:29
Lol sure, great story. Almost like saying the move to bcash. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:22:32
It won’t go up in that speed each month. And we will have corrections. But overall 2018 will be a great year for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:49:36

@_date: 2018-08-07 03:26:50
I agree except calling it money! You have an actual asset you own your own bank, its gold 2.0.. Money is more like this government printed paper

It’s a decentralised blog so everyone can post on it. They have over 500 writers of I am correct. Anyway I did write a lot in the past but did not much since many month. Great blog most of the time except the political stuff, but as I said many writers and many opinions hehe

Great finally can't wait for a network what spy on people and sell there data to control my money.. Forget btc for Facebook that's for sure... Alone saying that is nuts
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:59:30
If you are new to crypto start with BTC, but read up and not expect to get rich over night or even weeks.. Make your own due diligence and never invest more as you are willing to lose.

Maybe some bad meds went through his life support machine
@_date: 2018-05-12 05:17:30
So you saying since we had a shit start of the year and an incredible last year and you not be rich within a few weeks its about btc.. You are in for the wrong reasons. Chill, hold, enjoy the good times and chill, hold and read a book when we have a bad day. My point fucking chill.. No one can get rich over night
@_date: 2018-05-06 04:28:58

Multisig... autocorrect lol
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:46:16
Could be. I called 4K after the fork. But nailing it in days..? It gonna happen sooner or later
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:49:09
If you believe in bitcoin, time to invest is any day! Will btc go down, maybe! Will it go up? Probably! But in the long term i am sure it will go up. I wouldn't ask for financial advice and always do what your own research and of course your financial situation allowes.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:29:16
So you saying you not get back In? We won't see 3k!
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:07:07
Multi signature. You can setup one wallet on your phone, another on your PC and a third on an iPad... then when you send coins at least one of the other two wallets need to confirm that you send btc
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:01:49

For ios unfortunately trezor has no app yet
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:31:49
Copay is great, setting multisig up makes it even greater. Mycelium is fantastic if you have a trezor or a ledger unplugged (hardware wallet)
@_date: 2017-08-06 09:03:38
Depend on the country you are in. There are some places you can go very far with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-22 07:13:22
Officially or a email what looks like it come from an exchange? 
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:09:11
You can switch in most wallets to bits and then the number look less odd. That said yes 0.000... Can be spend and it works perfectly

Yup now that is autocorrect as it worst lol
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:12:44
We went so low, it's like Christmas last year. Oh wait, that was like 10 days ago. We went up hard, it's a correction!

@_date: 2018-06-12 12:55:07
If you don't sell your 20 btc.. How they turn into 10? 1 btc is 1 btc just as it was 12 month ago 
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:44:02
OK then good luck buying at $1k lol
5 weeks on reddit sold at the top. Great for you oracle of crypto. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:56:41
Yes seen that too... kinda ask myself wtf
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:03:10
Should have maybe, but I do fine holding for a long time, cashing out whenever I need cash. I am greatly in plus and don’t swing or trade.

3 days here through shit like pump and dump investigation.. the 20k was pushed by new people who just blindly went into crypto hoping to become millionaires over night. If they would not panic sell now we would not see such a massive correction. But after every big rise was a fall.. and a bigger rise followed. Still more then double of the price as 12 month ago
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:23:47
I believe this is already on its way. I have high hopes on altcoin.io 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:25:09
I like no hope and end of the world and its over posts. That's the indicator to buy. When they say its 20k it goes to 1m its the time to sell.. Just saying..

Cute.. You have no idea how btc works or what it does.. Get the book "the age of cryprocurrency" read it and check back. If you still don't understand crypto feel free to ask or post bollony claims like this 
@_date: 2018-06-07 08:36:02
It is showing instantly on the blockchain, most shops would be happy with that. Lighting Network will change this all for the better. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 04:29:14
Fiat serves Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe.. all very well. I not say we have an entire world fiat collapse anytime soon. But not backing fiat at all, is not a good idea. That's my opinion. Am I right? Maybe not. But I bet my money on bitcoin over any fiat currency anyway
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:29:14
The don't understand bitcoin, that why they don't give a shit. You can be on the right side of history or the wrong side. Remember Kodak said no one gives a shit about digital photography. Wrong side!
@_date: 2016-12-24 08:01:34
Euro, but I am staying in Asia since years. Don't actually make a difference what currency it is. Bitcoin can be owned by me and not parked in a bank. I can cash out to fiat within minutes if needed. I got most of the restaurants and places I shop accepting bitcoin by now. As I said I am a happy camper, but I understand other places in the world might be more difficult.
@_date: 2018-06-21 07:18:30

@_date: 2017-11-02 08:04:52
The price always goes down soon. Ask the people who ask the same question you just ask at 3k, 4K, 5k, 6k. If you are in for the long run I wouldn’t wait. If you are in for the day trading and get rich fast then wait for a dip. Like many before you ;)
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:37:43
I call bullshit on that stats

Cash created out of thin air, look at Zimbabwe, Argentina, Venezuela.. list goes on and tell me cash is good! Vs PayPal? A controlled website what can close your account or withhold your money without any reasons.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:06:26
It called bcash anyway. It’s decentralised and we can call it whatever we want. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:21:25
Korea just got the biggest mall to accept in each of the almost 700 stores to accept btc. Bitcoin is booming in Korea and Japan. Rest of the world just not realised yet they dictate the price. We see 12k in no time 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:38:16
As long you have the 16 words you should be fine. Try copay or any other wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:20:02
Put your money into a bank! Lehman brothers showed you how it’s done. Zimbabwe and Argentina or Venezuela and many others see what they can buy with there safe fiat currencies 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:52:51
Bread is also not a hard wallet. I have my btc on trezor. Ledger and trezor are in my opinion the safest ways. Paper wallet is also great. But I think blockchain will do for the fork at least. Depending on how much money in you in bitcoin consider a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:07:24
You can send it daily and it arrives daily. But it takes a hell of a long time.

Crypto pro! I have it too! Love the app and it does altcoins too

We I been in bitcoin since 2012, I seen highs, dumps and more highs. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:22:54
I think we go to 12500 before any dip back to 11400
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:51:12
I would go with 12500 but I am happy with your 15k
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:34:13
There is always a chance. There is also a chance we go to 10k before Christmas. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:25:35
I am with you on that one 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:08:06
I don’t dislike bcash. I just don’t think we should fork every few weeks a new bitcoin. Because that’s creating money out of thin air and if I want that I stick with fiat.

@_date: 2017-11-27 11:40:55
Like thin air? FIAT currencies? Bitcoin is proof of work, it’s closer to gold as to the usd what is not backed by anything but the number what is printed on it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:28:26
Well if it was mtgox your coins are gone. Eth and btc are solid picks. I am in some other Alts involved.. not the place here to talk about tho. Good luck anyway. Hope you hit it big!

Alts getting slathered! But they will correct back up. Selling the Alts back now with a lost makes you double losing. Your call tho, as it’s your money
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:05:39
Look at amazon and Apple stock charts and tell me they look any different. It’s a bubble but it won’t pop. Mass adoption, media attention, governments what fuck it up, banks what mess it even more up. We don’t need to try to fight them. They doing a great job destroying them self 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:41:37
End of 2018? We could and probably will be at 50k per bitcoin. Is this crazy talk? Maybe! I am around since way before mtgox. So seen a lot of dumps and even more highs. At the end of the day it’s about adoption. And it seems we getting a hell more in 2018
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:19:10
Make some research on it, it opens even ways for atomic swaps.. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:53:41
If it goes to 10k it won’t go to 1k. There is way more money in crypto as 2012. Also the crash you thinking of was because of mtGox with a price what went up because of the willy not. I can see a crash back into the 5000s but I doubt we go lower. I can be wrong, but I don’t think we need to prepare for a 75% or more crash
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:14:48
 is working on that
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:20:17
But but the lambos ��
I am with you tho. I won’t sell even if we drop. I doubt we do tho
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:31:47
That’s good! That gives the bcash people the option to pump there altcoin
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:38:57
I disagree! I am a bitcoin hodlr and believer but I hodl multiple altcoins and believe in them as strong as in btc. If not stronger potentially from here. I hodl Alts!
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:22:23
I am not sure if you are sarcastic or just making a joke here. The guy in the news knows shit or he would have btc and wouldn’t read the news, but sipping margaritas. See I am be sarcastic too :)
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:01:18
Well btc fees are high, consider an altcoin for storage and the fees are way lower
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:54:03
Why? Did copay issue any statement? I believe the coins should be safe in copay?
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:22:22
I think if we go a cross all exchanges over 10k we see 12k in no time 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:46:33
Best advice I ever got was buy regardless on what price btc is every week the same amount you can afford. In the end you will be in a great position 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:48:36
I didn’t bother read all you said! But this is not a one exchange world anymore. Mtgox was pretty much all or most of the btc transactions. That why we crashed. Plus the price was artificially up thanks to Willy Bot! Now we have many exchanges and I am not saying we can’t have a crash. But we won’t have a crash like this anymore. Also if everyone who went in at the top of the 2013 mtgox peak... and hodl they made a shitload of profits!
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:12:46
The 3rd time I read that today! How about openbazaar or particl.io let’s create a decentralized amazon and stop the middle man all together.

@_date: 2017-11-08 01:22:43
I read this every day.. same questions.. buy if you plan long term. Wait if you are a gambler. As a gambler you can miss out or win. Simple as that. If you hold long term it won’t matter if you buy now or if there is a small dip!
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:25:03
Wow is that the future? 2018?
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:44:56
It’s over 10k in Japan and Korea
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:26:54
Because we went over 7k we go to 8k! It’s common sense! Nah kidding, he has a point, we needed a dip before we go higher
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:47:01
It you restor you have 2 pc’s with the same wallet and that’s not a problem at all..you can spend on one and it gets deducted on the other one. Your coins are not on a software they are on the blockchain
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:10:15
Like the one we had from 10k to oh never mind 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:42:33
I am back in Alts started yesterday as it was to easy to pick great Alts for good prices..

No he can’t or people would see it. Remember you are getting the same address on both chains
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:14:32
But, hodl... and sell when you fee like it’s up enough your initial investment. I am all in since many years and only take out what I need for living. Rest stays in.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:35:49
Well that’s strange then. I am not a roger fan at all, just don’t see why he would do a scam wallet. That why I ask

Needed! We can’t just go up. Small dip then higher. Happened at 2k, 3k, 4K, 5k, 6k and now 7.5k it’s good news ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:08:14
Wrote down your 12 or 24 words to back your wallet up. Or the wallet.dat file on a stick. And you are fine. Maybe consider a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger.

Openbazzar and particl.io are working on the next amazon. Let’s go full decentralized! Should we!

You can consider mining litecoin or any other alt coin as it would give you a change to actually make some money. You can always buy bitcoins with the mining rewards. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:36:07
Do you have a 12 or 24 word backup phrase? If so you can restore you wallet
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:00:45
As long you not sell and hodl you also don’t have too
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:40:36
I don’t get your point? So you saying you have some btc? Congrats man?
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:43:20
And each on deserve it! Hodl!
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:41:39
You ask in the bitcoin group.. expect a bitcoin answer. I am in both tho 
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:39:19
They must be new here! It’s good we can’t just go up. We had corrections on every 1000 leg we took and took then a new time high... just chill, play altcoins. Enjoy the day, smell the flowers or whatever. It’s a normal day in crypto paradise
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:01:15
Who cares every time I read bubble and dead we go up! Mainstream doing a great job
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:02:19
I think saltlending (salt based on ethereum tokens) is working on such a solution. Depending on the country you are in, bitcoin can already be accepted in many places. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:29:19
I think we see a dip but we see new and higher highs too. We are not mainstream yet, getting closer tho
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:59:32
Need to admit it was fun to watch. I still not sure why we can’t call bcash bcash. It will always be called bcash!
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:32:34
Scroll to yesterday and the day before and the day before and.... this question is it to late will there be a dip should I buy now... daily! Yet what you need to ask yourself is, do you want to hold and be in for the long ride or just here to be billionaire and buy a lambo tomorrow? Because if you are try to wait for a dip, if you are in for the long ride, jump on board as once we go over 10k things getting crazy ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:03:00
Might be slower lol.. congrats
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:19:40
Good for you, I don’t gamble my money. So I still with my btc. Again this is a scam and they do not have 10% of all bitcoins. Still wish you all luck in the world to make money on it
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:19:14
We crash weekly so what? In the end we go up
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:53:33
Something where you own the private key! If you have a lot of money invested even consider a hardware wallet (trezor or ledger).
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:30:06
I read that same question since $30 every single time we hit a major number and lately at 2k and 3k and 4K... it’s time to go fiat when you think fiat is the future! If you believe in decentralisation and that bitcoin actually can change the world then enjoy your coffee late, tell some chicks you own btc and get a smile for free. I am hodl and that paid out since a very long time

I am all in! I said what i honestly believe. I think we won’t pop. Can I be wrong? Sure. Should I advice him to sell and it goes to 100k? I said what I believe happen and when you look at Apple or amazon charts they look just like a bubble. Why you believe with the media attention we get now because we crossed this 10k line we gonna pop? I believe we get way more attention now and therefore more people see and read about bitcoin and decentralisation. Sorry if I believe that way. I am hodl since $30 and you have no idea how many times people said it gonna pop! It corrected many times, and yes we had mtgox but in the end this coin is limited to 21m coins and around 4m are lost and we only mind what 16m? So once again take my words not as a financial advice! I am sorry if you took it that way, but an opinion and I think that what he was asking for.

If you got in at 5k you would have doubled your money. Depending on what country you are in, there are exchanges. Bitfinex, kraken, localbitcoins.. you can buy and sell at the same exchange
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:46:45
Because it’s a scam and to attract people you make stats up. Tomorrow they exceed the total supply of btc! Remember we have what 15m mined so far and 4m lost.. so they have more than 10% of all btc? Sure lol 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:23:51
That is blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:19:28
Because adoption is bigger as stupidity on selling... also major media outlets have headlines all time high.. went over 10k. Many people wake up and say fuck I need that coin too.. reading since years about it. We see 12500 before years end!
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:01:25
I would email some of the exchanges and ask if they do. Or try localbitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:00:41
You mean blockchain.info? Or on the blockchain? As if you can take it off the blockchain, please share how ;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:34:03
Openbazaar or particl.io and a few others I think working or presenting alternatives fully decentralised. I think 2018 will be a great year seeing a even more aggressive switch to decentralised apps. So who cares about amazon or eBay. Let’s create the next generation decentralised ecosystem
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:48:25
Bitcoin is proof of work! It’s backed by electricity and computer power. It’s is also limited to 21m coins ever in excites vs unlimited printing from the USD

It can dip it can go higher. If you hold long time the price now not matter. If you in for the quick bucks maybe wait for a dip. No financial advice here, but I seen bitcoin going down, then always higher as it been before.

And all who sold buy back later.. Some probably higher as they sold. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:20:09
It's because once the announcement will be its just regulations coming in and the exchanges need licenses... Everyone buys back. So let's Fud more to get a cheaper price.. I just watch and think.. Been there, seen that.

Coinbase is not a wallet! If you have more btc get trezor or ledger hardware wallets. On your computer try electrum bitcoin wallet. It is always important that you own the bitcoin key. Or you do not own the bitcoin at all. So forget about coinbase and binance as a storage
@_date: 2018-02-16 09:34:24
First of all you should never leave any coins on an exchange! Ever! Buy and get them off. Binance is great to trade altcoins.

Every year the same until early April... we also went way to fast and high up. I believe 2018 will be a great year for crypto.

@_date: 2017-09-29 06:13:53
Regulating bitcoin mean they actually make it more legal if anything at all.. So this is seen as a good sign. Regardless what you read. So much FUD in crypto is the only thing what actualy hurts the rise. Not some government what want to regulate the exchanges.. What again is a good thing on the long run for crypto 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:04:31

There will be no exchange ban! That was fake news. There is an temporary ICO ban. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:08:36
Coins.ph might be more as a wallet, but it is still not wise to keep the BTC on someone else’s wallet or control. As much as coins.ph looks great so did mtgox, cryptsy, mintpal, bitcoin24, the list of failed exchanges and services what are also more as a wallet goes on. Invest in a hardware wallet and it is not that complicated and you do not need to be a geek to figure out how to write down 24 words. I just seen a lot since I joined BTC back in 2012 and my advice is control your own crypto do not have it on an online service. Or just keep your money at the bank what is basically the same thing. You give it out of your own control! Again coins.ph is a great service and I appreciate bitasia from coins step up here, but it is still a online service! Control your own coins!

It's because once the announcement will be its just regulations coming in and the exchanges need licenses... Everyone buys back. So let's Fud more to get a cheaper price.. I just watch and think.. Been there, seen that. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:09:05
So you moved real safe money into a bank? Sounds smart :)
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:11:29
If everyone sells BTC is worthless. I hodl since 2012 and do pretty well. I keep hodl now. 3 month ago we were 1800. We do pretty good

I bet when cars been introduced the first time, he was against it and sticked to his horses for years.
@_date: 2017-09-22 12:19:34
Creating money out of thin air is what scars him.. Wait a minute. Never mind Fiat is backed by less then that lol
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:47:03
You got that BCH or BCC for free, it was not an ICO. Bitcoin is not effected
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:59:36
No idea what the article says.. Didn't click it. I make money in BTC since 2012 by hodling 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:52:00
In China red is the lucky color. Great discount. I have buys at 2800 not sold anything tho.. I never did and never will! Hodl since 2012.. Doing OK ��
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:37:48
We can meet up and I give it in cash to you. I am sure in 2009 you got that on an exchange? Oh wait.. such bull, very shit
@_date: 2018-03-25 01:13:17
This is almost criminal. Roger really lost it
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:15:01
Good for you try to sell when the stock markets crash... I am comfortable in the useless crypto I have ;)
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:21:37
We are beyond 5000$ and only because we have a small dip before the next rise I wont sale. Hodl since 2012, happy as always 
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:32:24
Every time that shit.. When 3 month ago we went down to 1800 same shit.. And now after a crash we are way higher as 3 month ago.. Chill and wait as long you not sell you won't lose. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:18:31
That why you not short btc! Just hodl and be less greedy. Sorry for him, but t he learned a valuable lesson. Someone simple not short btc!
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:40:41
It can also go to 6500 tomorrow and you lose your opportunity now to buy cheap. No one can tell you what the price is we sure look bullish
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:49:57
You never lose until you sell
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:46:29
You have this number based on a massive research? Or just feel like saying it? I say 8800 $
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:36:31
Spacesuit ready! Lets go
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:36:16
Yes it goes up or down. Could also stay the same ;)
It’s crypto no one can really predict what happens next. I say we go higher, but I always hodl and believe we go higher
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:53:20
Sorry I meant discounts on website what accept btc when you pay in btc
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:59:28
Could be for the cloud service and the price rise from yesterday could be already based on hope for amazon. I would love to see your 10k call tho
@_date: 2017-10-01 04:45:31
If it hits 100k I don't think of trading anymore 
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:35:28
Check both projects out and make your own due diligence. That’s always the safest way. But they both have unique projects what will be needed. And both are still a bargain. Way undervalued.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:50:45
Looks good to me lol
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:45:16
You mean like the federal reserve? Printing money out of thin air?
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:48:00
When you cash out it is removed as soon it’s send. Maybe contact the exchange and let them know.
@_date: 2017-10-09 07:27:21
You lost me by considering having your coins in coins.ph
Alwasy have your coins in your own controlled wallet. Not at an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:46:28
Or just hold and watch when we break 6500 and then take the 7000
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:20:54
Ripple no way! 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:57:43
Because if everyone buys price goes up and we have buy walls in lol
Nah I think price is fine now.. but can be better or worst in an hour ��
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:26:43
This is how hodl started
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:58:51
That meme for 19k is way more sexy! But the one for 28k next December will be epic
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:41:39
I think your number is way off.. Wasn't it 800+ times BTC died
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:52:00
In China red is the lucky color. Great discount. I have buys at 2800 not sold anything tho.. I never did and never will! Hodl since 2012.. Doing OK ��
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:18:26
Particl on testnet looks already fantastic. Can’t wait for the mainnet release. This is one of the most exciting projects in crypto
@_date: 2018-07-14 09:56:24
Most of them use fiat currencies, this shit should be banned
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:15:33
I use it from paying my electricity bill to load my phone to use it on a daily basis. Only because you don’t use it... doesn’t make everyone don’t use it. And listen to someone who scammed many people and went to prison for it sounds like a good source about getting the news.. wolf of Wall Street lol.. penny stock artist. Great book tho, movie was okish the guy however don’t understand bitcoin and feel to talk about it
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:45:20
What are you smoking? Great stuff lol
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:04:12
3100 then back to 4k. BTCC listed icocoin and that why they got a notification. Huobi and okcoin don't and so far they have not received any regulation letters. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:00:13
Good luck. Buy at 2900 just to be safe 
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:00:41
You go in for the wrong reasons. The max you can get out is to break free from middle man, banks and government bullshit incoming. But one tip, not check the price every 5min, we have bad days, weeks and month. It will make you depressed. On the other hand ultimately it goes up.. just as I said not watch it on bad days ��
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:46:56
My old friend how you been

Hey he passed a lie detector! He must be the real deal ;)
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:17:04
Shit so you saying its the second most favourite currency after FIAT?  
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:30:06
Yes got that a spam too
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:51:12
Better you sell then! All time high kicks in soon enough 
@_date: 2018-07-03 06:37:29
Downvote me but I stick with my prediction, same as every time this question comes up. 1 btc will be 1 btc! Don’t think short time and don’t care or stress about the price. The tech will succeed and then price take care of itself. We don’t need an USD price somewhere in the future. If this works out the way we all hope..

Never worked died many times! Yet strong and winning! I see negativity since 2010 check they price and adoption back then vs now and tell me it doesn’t work again..
@_date: 2018-07-22 09:42:58
Bitcoin was never designed to be anonymous! If you want an anonymous transaction you need to look at Monero or particl. But again you need to do mostly KYC to buy coins. Or getting them from other users
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:33:32
Ark and particl, ETH, salt and a handful others.. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:50:45
Buy walls up, please sell and cry later
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:41:19
Localbitcoins, no ID usually depends on your country and on the amount you like to buy/sell
@_date: 2018-04-22 05:07:24
And what could happen when you post an btc account here? Someone sends you funds lol as long you not share your private key you are fine. But yes banks seem very secure and never been compromised or withholding funds ��
Enjoy your life, once you understand crypto who knows you might come back
@_date: 2018-04-11 06:14:04
Bitcoin is no bubble, its the pin
@_date: 2018-07-05 08:22:17
Haha never seen such bad journalism with such research and detailed explanations. I am super bullish. Every time bitcoin dies it’s the buy signal. But this one is just..
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:20:27
Looks good, but they have a copy of your key? So how is this safe?
@_date: 2018-04-21 02:44:30
I am sure your father win this bet
@_date: 2018-04-14 02:43:10
That was years ago tho. Still cool
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:07:35
You would enter for the wrong reason.. so better not buy bitcoin

Bitcoin is not banned jn India or China. That said, you cant ban a.decentralized system.

Bitcoin is no bubble, its the pin
@_date: 2018-04-15 12:23:03
Nope its more like 90s
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:13:58
Concerned about what? If it was $30 I doubt it was a massive money laundering operation. So nothing really to worry mate
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:06:09
Good move Manfred! Very valid points you have!

1800s but i can be wrong

Bitcoin, Ark, Partic and Sia

I send last year a wrong amount! Way way higher as I should! Drunk trade! I was panicking and emailed them, refunded within a few hours! Shapeshift is fantastic and has a great great team and support!
@_date: 2017-07-14 01:54:51
I doubt it, as it happens to all altcoins. Alpha Bay had btc and xmr. Btc was not dumped as hard as all the altcoins
