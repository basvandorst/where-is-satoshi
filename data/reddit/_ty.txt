Bad idea, don't do it. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose has always been true, but is especially true now.

And you might want to make intelligent comments over resorting to swearing like a 12 year old. Maybe you are twelve in which case why am I even arguing with you.

Are you that daft of a cunt to not even understand what happened in 08? Of course you are.

People here are hilarious. Just read up a little bit of Econ, how monetary policy works and listen to some basic podcasts like Planet Money before you start having opinions on the Fed.
This grand libertarian view of no fed, no bail outs, no lose monetary policy would’ve ended the western economies as we know them today if applied after 08. If anything the Fed deserves tremendous amount of credit for the tools they used after ‘08.

Harshly said, but even without regulation, letting capitalism do it's thing will get us back to reality at some point.

Don't actually know what BTC does, but you can imagine a situation where  -
Each block has a timestamp on it, so once you mine a block and broadcast it, all nodes in the network will eventually know how long it's taking to mine a block. They can then decide to accept the solution to a less difficult problem as valid. 
I'm sure there are additional safe guards etc I haven't thought about but it feels technically implementable.
