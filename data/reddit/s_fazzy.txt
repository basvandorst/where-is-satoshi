Craigslist has a "Cryptocurrency okay" option for those sellers who are willing to accept it as payment for items. Also in my area of Vancouver there are dealerships and realtors that accept bitcoin as payment and etc.

My bad. I meant to say, they did say they were going to recoup the losses however, do they have the 40 million  worth of BTC on hand in reserves or are they going to have to get some loans and start purchasing BTC to pay off those who got funds stolen? That they never mentioned. Although I'm sure they have it in reserves. Their profits during bear markets was even really really high.

Read my karma on why facebook will have such a big impact, and they aren't talking about it. They have reported to Bloomberg that they have a team working on their stable coin. They have companies like visa, Mastercard and PayPal sponsoring them which is cool considering they own that domain, seems like they don't want to get left in the dust. They also have some top executives working on it, one being a high official from PayPal. Good things to come. By the time we hit our next ath Itll be pretty stable. Good times acoming

I'm pretty positive binance is recouping losses for those whose funds got stolen. Do they already have the 40 million to give or are they going to have to buy it themselves? That I don't know. Plus at the rate at it's jumping right now, it could be safe to say big boys are accumulating before the next take off. The buy orders are going ridic

Facebook being a fucking megalodon in the fiat world, is releasing their own stable coin for p2p payments. Once an institution like that releases its project, without a doubt it will cause a massive chain reaction over night. The amount of institutions waiting on Bloombergs report to clarify a release date is ridiculous. Buy 1 bitcoin now so your children's children in 500 years are millionaires ;). Plus you sound like an old man calling the internet stupid and saying it won't last. Which majority of people did. Once their pee sized brains were able to comprehend what it is and how its better, easier, cheaper than books. They all hopped over. The doors to possibilities become infinitely open as the internet right now is the gateway to everything. Don't sleep on it but in the future social media websites might even run on the blockchain. To assure no user information is being hakced or stolen or seeing that no customer information is sold. There are so many things you can implement blockchain into to assure safety and regulation. It is bigger than the internet and everyone here will see just how big it is within 10 years. And you go on to say "you'd be foolish to pick any value over 0$" lol really? As its ath was 18k and even right now it's sitting around 7500 lol that just makes me laugh. Nothing you said said anything of importance as to why bitcoin will stay at 0$ which again which it has ultimately never hit. Lol get outta here and go back to msn and talk to your friends old man

Lol, in 2015 it was projected that the U.S government spent 54% of their federal reserves on your military budget and has been like that for years. Unlimited healthcare is not bad or a bad thing nor impossible to achieve. You guys just like making rich people richer, it's been studied in so many places that privatized insurance brings a drop in health, as a lot of people in the millions can't afford it. Lol keep watching fox dude
