You want your issue to get settled? Go everywhere and say how kraken is a scam and stealing your funds. They will contact you very quickly and be very helpful. Hit them where it hurts, destroy their reputation and they will bow. Works like a charm. I am a high volume top crypto daytrader, so I have a lot of issues and I am very demanding and strict with their support. They make a ton of money on my trades, they need to bow to me. I am customer, I am king.
