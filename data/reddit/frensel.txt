Do you know what fractional reserve lending is? It's lending more money than you have. How do you do that with bitcoins? You don't, because you can't give someone more bitcoins than you have in a bitcoin account according to the rules of the bitcoin protocol. 
What does this mean for Bitcoin? Well, it means they'll be less available than they would otherwise be. Good thing or bad thing? It depends if you want a very active medium of exchange (dollar analogue) or a very inactive store of value (gold analogue). Most Bitcoiners seem to want a gold analogue, so the fact that you can't do fractional reserve banking with Bitcoins would be a positive for them. Most Bitcoiners also don't realize that a gold analogue could never become a medium of exchange analogous to modern fiat currency, but whatever. They wanted internet gold, and they'll get it with the good and the bad that that entails.


You don't get to attack other people's qualifications in a subject where you don't *have* qualifications, or even a good grasp of the basics. And even if you had the qualifications it would be bad form. You really should stop.

Right, creating money. 
EDIT: For clarity - in the modern world, money IS an IOU. Like, the money I have in the bank is real money, and it comes in the form of an IOU from the bank backed by the Federal government. It's money, and it was *created* by a bank in the form of an IOU. The money that was put in it was another IOU, from another bank, that changed hands from my employer to me. That's what modern fiat currency *is,* unless you eschew banks which is not a viable decision. That's *not* what Bitcoins are. The distinction is incredibly important. 
The "creating money" part is done when I put cash into the bank. They can spend/loan some fraction of that money, *and* they give me an IOU *THAT IS ALSO REAL HONEST TO GOD GOVERNMENT BACKED FIAT.* That's created money. That system does not exist for Bitcoins, since any IOU you personally make in Bitcoins isn't "real" in the way that an FDIC backed bank deposit is.  


But that's not how Bitcoin accounts work - the Bitcoins you have in your Bitcoin account are yours in a way that is analogous to gold bars in a safe. This is fundamentally different from a bank account, where the money you deposit isn't "yours" in the same way - it is *replaced* by, say, a piece of paper saying that the bank owes you x dollars. 
On a fundamental level, the way you own fiat in your bank account is that you own *debt*. But when you have a numerical value in your Bitcoin address, you *own those Bitcoins,* not a promise from a bank that tells you you'll get them you ask for it.
I guess you're saying that you could set up a business that takes people's Bitcoins and exchanges them for an IOU, as a parallel to contemporary banks that work in dollars. Except that that's completely nonsensical - people put their money in the bank to avoid the problems and limitations inherent in holding cash, and the solutions to those problems that a bank provides are built into the Bitcoin protocol. That's pretty much *the entire point* of the Bitcoin protocol.

You seem to have the right opinions without the right reasoning.


Inflation is NOT "terrible" for rich people, because they tend to have ASSETS, like the other replier mentioned. Inflation is not "great" for poor people, because they tend to not have secure access to employment OR CREDIT, so they often are left out in the cold. 


This isn't particularly insightful. First of all, in terms of **personal** value, which is what we are talking about when we say something is "terrible" for x person and "great" for y, the poorer person losing 20% of the value of the few dollars they have can mean the difference between going hungry and not going hungry. For a rich person, the personal difference is far less profound. Also, the **ratio** of poor dollar wealth to rich dollar wealth stays the same, and that is of incredible importance because there is a huge amount of data indicating that people's happiness depends largely upon how they are doing comparatively rather than in absolute terms. 


No, it isn't. Deflation isn't nearly big enough to put the appreciation on the level of decent investments. 
Now let me explain what the correct underlying reasoning is for the opinion that inflation is fine and deflation isn't. It all revolves around **SPENDING.** 
Say you have a dollar. If you spend it now you will get two candies. If you spend it later you will get one. What are you incentivized to do? Spend that dollar. 
But say that if you spend it now you will get one candy, and if you spend it later you will get two. You are now incentivized to SAVE that dollar. 
Let's look at how the economy works. One very essential relationship you have to understand is that spending **IS** income. Every cent you use to feed and house yourself and your family was a cent that someone else had to SPEND. We rely on income to meet our basic needs. Therefore, below certain levels deprivation is proportional to how far down the spending level goes.
How do people behave when they are being deprived? Well, they become resource hoarders, and the most important resource is money. So as we fall below certain levels of spending, people cut back more and more. It's a downward spiral that only ends when something arrests it. 
Put another way, if there isn't enough spending **the system does not work.** It spirals down into disaster. 
This is **THE** reason why deflation is bad. It disincentivizes spending. And we need - DESPERATELY - to be incentivizing spending. A say, 20% decrease in spending is enough to plunge a huge portion of our society in to abject misery. 
This is also why government spending is so damned important. In order for the system to work, in order for it to not collapse, there has to be an entity that ensures that spending stays at certain levels. One of the main reasons that this recent economic disaster was not as bad as the Great Depression is that the government now has programs that automatically increase spending as private spending decreases. Specifically unemployment insurance, food stamps, and medicaid. Another thing that saved us was, of course, the non automatic government response - the bailout programs. 
Also, obviously, there are government taxes. Taxes are essentially forced spending. As you should now realize, this is incredibly important in order to keep things running. If taxes stopped and government spending decreased proportionally, then we'd be in the shitter - even allowing for the fact that people will spend some of the money they aren't forced to spend through taxes. You can look at inflation as forced spending, just like taxes. In the end, you see that our system - and *ANY* system that has people relying on income in order to provide for themselves - is deeply dependent upon forced spending to maintain itself.

It needs physical capital. Disc space and pipe space, like every other internet service. Governments control the pipe, governments can seize the discs. It is harder to pressure a bunch of different users than a centralized organization, but it can be done and will be done if the state is threatened. Even on matters that do not threaten the government, it casually escalates to wide-sweeping brutality, as seen in the war on drugs. Things that do threaten governments will see a whole new level of effort.

Which is a threat to the state how? On top of that, it isn't even as salacious and interesting as drugs or sex. 


Nah. They'll seize computers, they'll plant spyware, they'll spy on the pipes, they'll impose draconian penalties on violators - just like now, but scaled up x1000 if they feel they're threatened. Which they don't. And probably won't, but only because BTC probably won't be a currency "replacement" for most people.

The current "economic trouble" should be the wrong sort of "economic trouble" for that. The Fed is thinking about raising rates. That means the Fed is thinking about making dollars more expensive, essentially. That means dollars should get more expensive now, pricing in that possibility. Unlike, say, gasoline, people don't need gold, demand for it isn't inelastic, and gold isn't a company that might be holding or earning a lot of the possibly soon-to-be-more-expensive fiat, so...

People laugh when it has gone down, and get really interested when it has skyrocketed. So basically the exact opposite of what rational individuals trying to exploit volatility should be doing. This is great, this is exactly how smart people liberate idiots of their money.

For some people, sure. Not for a whole lot of people who are just scraping by. Education has to be a right, not something that is purchased. 
To see what actually happens when that's NOT the approach of society, look at college prices.

Public education isn't a "drain on society," it is of tremendous benefit to everyone.


I don't see the system as "broken." I see it as far from ideal, and I can see lots of no-brainer changes that would make it better, but it is much much *much* better than nothing. 
We're coming from extremely different perspectives on what society should be, I think.

Wat. He's saying he's a long term bull. Are you saying that the only way to come to that conclusion is "emotion and not facts?"

A stock is partial ownership of an actual, honest-to-goodness company. A company that either sells goods and services for a profit or is expected to sell goods and services for a profit. I'm not sure I think it's reasonable to compare that to Bitcoin... The service Bitcoin provides is dependent upon people paying in... Ehhh 
Now that I think if it it isn't fundamentally more arbitrary. But it does seem like it is piggybacking on unreasonable expectations and is very very unstable. And could be imploded instantly if the gov't decides they don't like it, and there have already been signs indicating that they don't.

Bitcoin is gold 2.0, not dollar 2.0. Like gold, it is inherently speculative, and that isn't a problem. You don't buy gold so you can buy things with gold, you buy gold so you can get more money for it at some later date. Bitcoin is that, but easier to transfer. 
And it is not analogous to a pyramid scheme or whatever, because there don't need to be a widening pool of buyers for this to work. The pool just needs to, at minimum, decrease at a low enough rate that Bitcoins beat inflation. That shouldn't be too hard.

If it's illegal, it's put down. If illegal, it is too impractical to exchange Bitcoins for normal currency for the currency to survive. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:11:06


Makes it easy to transfer. Which is important for speculation.


That was the intention. The things that were designed into it as part of that goal function in the real world to make it better for speculation.

They care a LOT because it influences how much money they can exchange Bitcoins for, and how easy it is to turn Bitcoins into "real" money.

A matter of opinion. But I will say that there are a great deal of practical benefits to considering it a right.

Teaching to the test is better than nothing. It's still education, it's just crappier education than it could be.

Most would rather have their children go to a public run school, because those are actually affordable. 
I'm sure lots of people would like to drive a Bugatti Veyron to work instead of their cheaper car if they didn't have to pay for it. That doesn't mean the Bugatti is the carmaker for most people. Quite the opposite, actually.

How is this not totally predictable to people here? I am a Bitcoin noob and even I see the pattern clear as day. During downtrends people are scornful, during uptrends people are cheerful. How weak willed do you have to be to take this shit seriously?


And? What is the relevance of this supposed to be? People can do what they want. The biggest problem I have is that people on both sides of the discussion take themselves WAY too fucking seriously. 


I don't think the people talking about the price are being diverted from working on technical solutions to the protocol's issues.
