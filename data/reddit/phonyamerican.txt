Yeah, this bullshit happened to me twice. First I sold something for $1200 and there was a chargeback claiming I never sent the item. Second, my account was hacked and $11,000 was stolen from my bank account. Fuck PayPal.

I would stay away from it if I was you, knowing TOR, it might be dangerous...

Well, When I filed a dispute, I got $1300 back. There was no way to get the other money. My bank account was sent $7100 into overdraft from this guy withdrawing money from it. I was devesated, it was my life, I contemplated suicide because really, for me, life wasn't work living anymore. 
No, the money is not completely back

I don't have chrome and due to where I live and other factors I cannot get it. Is there any change that I can still participate but using firefox? That would be excellent if we could make that work! 
Thanks so much!

My credit score was 912, so the overdraft was allowed! Yeah, it was devastated, apparently there is a loophole in ebay. It was a $2.99 stylus pen I bought, I ended up paying $10000 + for it D:
