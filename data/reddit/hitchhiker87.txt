These companies are under taxation responsibilities, without the permission of their governments they can't trade with Bitcoin.
Btw, the header of the news says: **"Turkey paid Bitcoin to Russia in return of Wheat transportation"**
and continues: **"...according to the Bloomberg, this trade makes Bitcoin to be used as payment method for the very first time for the international trade transportation"**

I've been in Bitcoin world since the last month and I damn ran out of real currency that I can't purchase more BTC as it made a very well dip.
I don't seek daily 3-5 $ profit, I'm gonna sleep on what I have and get more as much as I can until 2020.
If i lose my all BTC for a possibility of a game changer ATH of Bitcoin in my life, I m ready to sacrifice them by HODL'ing.
I'll HODL even if it dips to 1 $.

The bounce has already happened, we re going all the way up from now.
So... HODL !

We all have to make our own choices mate, I just saw that Bitcoin is the last train going to a better future for me. 
So I said "Let's take the risk that the Train can go out of the rails instead of living by knowing that I'll never get bigger than what I am now"
That's why I have to stick to Bitcoin as our fates are united.
If you have more options than it, I wouldn't recommend everyone to take the risk that I take. Just consider the best for you.

All I just want to see is 1 whole Bitcoin not affordable for ordinary people anymore.
If this happens... We the ones whom are ruining serious amount of brain neurons here will have themselves located on the Moon.
The question is; Is it possible in -2 years ?
