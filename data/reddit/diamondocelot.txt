You should still have 10 bch, providing you took out  1 btc after the fork. They are two separate cryptos. The addresses are the same but the amounts can be different. 
Your btc wallet: 9
Your bch wallet: 10

Check your email. There should be an email with an estimated reception date. It's normally 3-5 days.

Just to be sure I'm understanding this correctly, the 2 mb block size is good because it allows more transactions per block and lower fees, right? Thanks

While hardware wallets are great, it might be a little late for that given we are less than a week away from the fork. Shipping can take a while so you might not get your hardware wallet in time. 
If you have access to a hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger then go for it. But if you need another option, Electrum is great. There are many simple tutorials on YouTube for setting up an Electrum wallet.

So do you think that it is a good idea to buy bitcoin now, or wait until after Aug 1?

Yes, hardware wallets are great.

Could someone explain the important dates coming off if bip 91 does hit 80%. 
What exactly happens in August and what happens in November? When would a potential fork happen? 
Sorry this is all a bit confusing to me.

So what are the other important dates coming up. If 80% is reached. What happens in Aug and November? When might there be a fork? When would be the best time/ safest time to buy? Today? After aug? 
Thanks in advance.

Is it a good idea to buy bitcoin now, or wait until Aug 1 to buy some? I'm new and looking to invest a small amount.

When do you think the price will be lower? Do you expect it to drop on Aug 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:57:59
So why exactly is there going to be a hard fork? Is this fork in Nov inevitable or is there a chance bitcoin stays together? Thanks for answering my questions.

That is an interesting concept that sounds good considering I just plan on holding.
