I go to my local bitcoin ATM pretty frequently (at least 1-4 times a month) and there is always at least one other person there buying or selling bitcoin. I chuckled last time I went when I had to wait in a queue to use the bitcoin ATM ;)

Mr. Smith had nothing to do with Blockchain.info in 2013. Mr. Smith claims he 'co-founded' Blockchain.info with Ben Reeves and Nic Carey. They didn't. Ben Reeves built BCi by himself. Roger Ver invested money into BCi and brought Nic Carey on as CEO. Peter Smith came later on, took Carey's job as CEO and arguably ruined what could have been an amazing company. Fuck that guy. Fuck BCi.

1) have you tried looking for a bitcoin atm nearby?
You might have to make a trip of it but the upside is you don't have to give away your ID and the fees are not totally unreasonable.
2) You could also try  and buy multiple ways (Faster Payments, Cash in person, Cash Deposit, etc...) though you will need to fork over ID for some of those ways. 
3)  is also a great way to get bitcoin. You can grab small amounts with no ID using Faster Payments provided by your UK bank account. You can grab larger amounts once you start providing ID
Good luck.

Web or Mobile app?
On web - go to send - click 'advanced send' on the bottom left of the modal. 
On Mobile - I think they removed this functionality in their quest to make their wallet useless to almost everyone.

When you open a bank account the agreements you sign will allow them to share 3 mo of your transaction history with whatever AISP they so desire, but most likely immediately with Equifax and other credit rating agencies.

You should be able to bump the fee with using RBF with Electrum.

What wallet did you use to make the transaction?

Did you assign a fixed IP within your local DHCP network to the computer running the node? If not, the IP could have changed and the port forwarding might not be working anymore. Just an idea?

Those women (and men) were a part of this community long before you were. They've not only been long term community participants, they have contributed to the economic community by selling their goods and services in exchange for the bitcoin token. What exactly have you contributed?
NSFW has been on the sidebar for a very long time, long before the price was 1000+ USD  - If sidebar was responsible for limiting adoption don't you think the price would have decreased instead of increased? Or maybe it is that the subreddit or its sidebar is ultimately completely unimportant to Bitcoin adoption.
Thanks for playing.

@_date: 2017-10-23 08:27:43
If you trust your friend:
1) Send him your BTC address
2) Send him your local currency via regular postal mail.
Wait for him to receive the money and then have him send the BTC to your address. 
If you don't trust your friend it is more difficult...
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:21:18
This is cute. I think you're genuine, and I am glad you came asking. Don't take note of the trolling, you will learn to either like it, or you will become a pro at ignoring it. 
all that being said, you need to go buy $50 worth of bitcoin (coinbase.com, localbitcoins.com, bitcoin atm, whatever) and things will start to make more sense to you, since it is no longer a thought experiment...there would be actual value on the line.
Good luck!

Well that would run contrary to the source.


If this information is available by public API why didn't customer service point this out instead of being 'harassed'?
I've never heard of this public API and I have worked with ShapeShift API's in the past.
I would like to see a formal policy relating to the turning over of arguably identifying information on their users.
I would also like a clear yes or no on if ShapeShift are sharing this type of information with bitcoin banks (Coinbase, Circle, etc) that are known to monitor transactions?

Oh fun. Having to fork over tons of ID to some shady 3rd party just to buy a pocket change amount of Bitcoin. Living the dream. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:28:33
Probably because there is no one left there that actually uses bitcoin or understands what the hell BDD means.
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:43:43
I assume you bought through the Blockchain.info Wallet. 
You cannot sell the coins back through that wallet ;)
You need to find an exchange to sell your BTC and receive your national currency. 
Depending on your requirements you can use something like coinbase.com to buy/sell in the future or even something like localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:41:23
CorpoateCoin. Stay away from BC.i
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:48:56
Yes. I think it is better for you to send your coins to Coinbase - store them there - and sell at will. I would do this until you gain more experience. 
I wouldn't store a lot of BTC on coinbase, not because I don't trust them, but because if they go offline...well so do your bitcoins. 
But for now, it's the safest bet. 
DO NOT USE BLOCKCHAIN.INFO
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:01:28
Absolutely not. They're not safe ever. I'd trust exchanges more, and I don't trust exchanges at all.

Oh goodie, a literal paid shill
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:07:47
Hey. Thats really cool to hear. What game? 
There is a difference between the **acquisition/offloading** and the **storage** of your bitcoin. It is essential that you do not use the acquisition as the storage method. In your case using Poloniex as a wallet. 
A good lightweight way to store bitcoin is to use a mobile wallet like  Green Address, Samourai, Coinomi, Breadwallet, - basically any wallet where you store the keys on your device instead of a 3rd party service. Ask around, people are very happy to give wallet recommendations around here. 
There have been countless examples of what happens when people leave their bitcoin on 3rd party services and those services go away, get hacked, ceo gets busted, etc... They lose their bitcoin, and usually never get it back. It's happened so many times. Don't risk it. 
If you use one of the wallets i mentioned above or any wallet that refers to itself as "HD" or "BIP44", your bitcoin will be safe and in your control even if the companies that provide the wallet software cease to exist. 
Good luck 
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:09:59
What wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:52:49
If you have your mnemonic you might be able to import it into a wallet like Samourai Wallet and then tapping on the unconfirmed transaction to boost the transaction fee. You'll top up the transaction fee that the sender screwed up. 
edit: being downvoted, but not wrong...
@_date: 2017-06-29 05:09:51
It means you sent from one account in your blockchain.info wallet to another account in your blockchain.info wallet. Your balance should be correct minus the transaction fee to 'transfer' the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:22:54
I don't think Bitcore even supports Segwit yet
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:11:13
Sure it does. Exchanges are treating coins differently based on their history. It has everything to do with fungibility. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:53:38
"but noobs will understand bits better" they said. 
You can change it (and you should) in your settings to show BTC instead of 'bits'. Decimals aren't scary and you will feel better working towards making that decimal a whole number ;)
Good luck
