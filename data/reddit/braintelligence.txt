Even better. OTG\-usage of the Ledger Nano S is planned in the future. If you put the seed into it then you lost the extra protection a hardware wallet has to offer. Though AFAIK you can do it, if you want, the Enjin Wallet supports several import functions.

I don't see the means of how they could compromise your Trezor. I didn't use Trezor yet but Ledger has backup words you can write down to restore your private key. Did you by chance save backup words somewhere, where they could be found by others?

More like a straight 0, because the likelihood to even reach a single share might not be given for weeks or months. Still, you're mining Bitcoin there, it's just unprofitable as fk.

Thank you for jinxing it :P

You do realize that hard forks may be technically trivial but consensus may be not? You do realize that every more possible zero may exponentially increase the amount of data needed to be transferred for every transfer and thus might increase the fee?

Are you the author? The lack of basic grammar skills indicates as much.
What I'm saying is that the P102 mining card is a castrated 1080 Ti with no video output.
The resaleability to gamers thus is nonexistent and the price of mining cards tend to be very close to their gaming counterparts without real benefit of using them over the others.

Looking at past such castrated mining cards there wasn't such a huge price difference. But we will see. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:12:05
Negative in what sense? But yeah it's not profitable currently. Still possible and that was the point. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:37:21
I don't know what you're getting at. The link is from this answer and the comments prove that it was a working proof of concept. 
You can mine Bitcoins on anything that can run SHA-256 and any Turing complete machine can run SHA-256. Heck, you can even do SHA-256 on a fucking sheet of paper with your brain.
I won't dig for eloquent software to prove basic computer science to you. Any first semester computer science student knows that you're wrong. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:47:32
This wouldn't change the fact that you or your organisation were the only ones to really have control over the blockchain.
One mistake could lead to everything going down the drain and people would have to invest upfront. You can call it staking or whatever you want, it doesn't change the fact.
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:10:36
Well you're implying that Turing complete machines can't do SHA-256 which is wrong. It's even possible to get a block reward there, but the likelihood of this happening is almost nonexistent.
That's something completely different from "you can't", though. So please don't spread crap. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:35:27

There's so many ways to erase Bitcoin tracks... You can launder them by wiring them to NiceHash, you can shapeshift them to Monero or other privacy coins, you can sell it OTC and more.
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:23:06
Please do :P
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:48:00
Based on that logic BTC can assimilate any functionality of any given cryptocurrency available today, because a hard fork can involve anything from "we got haxxord pls hard fork to reverse that" up to a change of PoW algorithm.
It's highly unlikely that BTC will overtake smart contracts from ETH or privacy from Monero (or else BTCP would have mooned like shit already).
That being said, stop assuming that BTC is likely to become anything you want it to, just because it's technically possible.
Otherwise, if it really was just about the possibility at all: alrighty then.
By the way, BTC will moon tomorrow, because we gonna hard fork and redistribute the BTC from Mt. Gox wallets into everyone else's wallets.

@_date: 2018-03-09 21:51:25
You can earn fees by staking, but what if you rather want to provide PoW? It doesn't have to be high-energy work. Look at burstcoin for example.

What is the gist of that comment? Are you saying that you can't spin up a browser-based Bitcoin miner almost platform-agnostic, even though evidence that it works lies before you? That smiley, tho... 
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:29:40
I worked in tech support at Uni for four years and it's an important part of client service in my own company since 10 years. I rather say it can't be done in a profitable way, because THAT's what people are interested in, than stating untrue things, because my clients ultimatively pay me for my expertise and not for me doing my own part of thinking what might be best for their case, and on top of it blatantly lie to achieve what I think may be best for them, without explaining why. 
This is the difference between a top-notch IT-consultant and IT-Support guys who moan about the reason of their existence and paycheck.
It's not a "technicality" to say "You can't mine Bitcoin profitably on anything but an ASIC." instead of "You can only mine Bitcoin on ASICs."
Imagine you tell this to a customer and then he makes a laughing stock out of himself on the next meeting with business partners who know better, after he states confidently what he has learned from you as a professional.
You have no idea what you're talking about, sorry. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:31:57
Is this the reason why BTC is exploding right now?
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:33:49
You would have to make sure that those tokens can only be generated by exercise machines and thus be the only owner of the needed private key to do this.
Therefore it would be a proprietary thing that only you as the owner had the means to allow creation of such tokens. You'd need an immense market power to force this upon the exercise market. It would also go against what blockchain stands for, because not every manufacturer could just go and do this, without investing into YOUR organisation.
IMHO this is the wrong way to do this.
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:24:12
Oh sure, so how will the perpetrator break into the secured vault of my bank again? 
@_date: 2018-03-24 09:04:32
Is that some disguised argument explaining how someone threatens a bank to open its secured vault, or just a sad try of ad hominem based on... a nickname? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:27:11
Nice strawman again. Where did I say you said that BTC can or can't assimilate any functionality of any given cryptocurrency?

You're deliberately ignoring the progression of quantum computing at DWAVE. We're already at 1000 Qubits. It won't take long to be able to perform a shit ton of operations at the same time, unlike binary processors who can only do one operation at a time (per thread). 
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:22:34
Memorizing your seed is a terrible idea. Write it down and keep it in a safe space, preferably in a guarded and insuranced bank vault. Or else face the danger of getting your seed tortured out of you (or even muttering it in your sleep). 
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:26:32
Dude, I'm not here to convince you of choosing a seed of a higher entropy. I just told you that the 12 word seeds will be the next to be insecure as long as Moore's Law is working.
By the time it is known that brute force power got strong enough via hardware and software upgrades many Bitcoin Wallets will have been attacked simultaneously. There will be no safe moment to know that an upgrade of entropy is necessary before things happen. Things will happen long before any signs of things happening appeared. The only thing you can do then is to react.
I don't know what your dissonance to this is, but you can do whatever you want. Just don't think that 12 word seeds will stay secure forever (not even for the next years) and don't think you will get warned. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:04:37
Did you foresee the current dip? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:52:52
Reversal! 
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:06:27
Um, yeah? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:15:38
I hope you realize that going from 12 to 24 words is not doubling your security but exponentially rising it.
The reason why 9 words and less are deemed insecure here is because current conventional computation speeds don't allow for finding a specific private key to a given public key in a timely manner for seeds with higher entropy.
We don't know if this is not true anymore in a few years for 12 word or even 24 word seeds. 
Heck, SHA-256 could be fucked in 5 years, who knows? 
So if you don't want to be highly likely to learn a new seed anyway in the next years because 12 words seems to be the thing that's barely considered secure now and will break next, then you should go for more words soon. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:05:33
