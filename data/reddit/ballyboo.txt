If he offered 2% interest do you really think he would have had investors "gamblers" throwing so much money at him? 7% a week was irresistible to the greedy, but anyone with half a brain will realise that 7% interest a week is unsustainable no matter what business you are in. At 7% per week starting with only $1 in 10 years you would have $1,903,550,471,272,317.00

That's exactly what I am saying, people should go somewhere else, but most users do not realise this. This practice is complacently deceptive. It is not explained anywhere in detail and would not be an excepted practice in any other market other than Bitcoin. I would be happy if MtGox explained this to their users but they simply dont.

For one. They should display Last Local on there site and not Last All unless an actual transactions can happen at that price in that currency. Example: I had a buy price at $10.00 when the price was above that and the Last price doped to $9.89 but my buy never  took place. This is a misleading and deceptive practice as the price needs to drop well below that for the actual transaction to take place using their so called pooled currency exchange

They use a pooled currency exchange at MtGox. This gives them the ability to process and order in another currency and pocket the difference when the exchange rate allows. You will notice that if you go to a currency that has low volume the Last: is often lower than the Sell: amount and sometimes even lower than the Buy:. How can this be happening so often? This is because What they display as Last: is actually Last All: not Last Local:. If it was a true pooled exchange as soon say the USD went lower or met the equivalent offer in say in AUD there would be a sale, but you will notice that this is not the case. It seem that it needs to go below the current exchange rate by about 2 or 3 % before a sale is made. I am sure they are skimming off the top for every international transaction. 
Bitcoin is not regulated by governments to make this sort of practice illegal at the moment, so the only way to get it fixed is by standing up to MtGox and saying this practice in not acceptable. Vote with your mouth and if it falls on deaf ears, then vote with you Bitcoins. This is why we need more competition in the Bitcoin space

What people don't seem to understand is that even 1% per weeks is enormous interest, let alone 7%. 1% per/w would even be unsustainable in the long run. Anything over 10% per/a is an excellent return and anything over 20% per/a should be seen as a high risk gamble. Pirate was offering over 3000% per/a
