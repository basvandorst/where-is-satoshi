He seems to have already made a profit, so I think his quest succeeded.

Have you heard of the gift option in paypal? There's no fee and it's instant. I'm not sure about the regional limitations though, but I'm pretty sure you can create an account in any country and receive the money, you just won't be able to withdraw the money (so you can still buy things with it as long as it doesn't get shipped, virtual items like PC games or gift cards.)
I agree with NjStacker22, bitcoin is great but this isn't a major selling point at all.

If this happens eBay would have to make their own paypal like system for bitcoins, or maybe the ability to add bitcoins to paypal. They're definitely going to want a way to "protect" buyers hoiwever they see fit.

I've just used the wallet file, encrypted with the built in client. There are two stages of security I guess, them actually somehow acquiring the wallet file, and then cracking the password.

Do you try to recover wiped data? Or are these drives just not formatted when tossed?

Maybe, but the average college student probably isn't going to have wallets with cryptocurrency either.

I've always wondered if a huge company like Amazon could manipulate the price of Bitcoin if they wanted to. Buy a bunch of bitcoin, then announce that 1 Bitcoin = $4000 worth of Amazon goods.

I'm not up to date on Bitcoin, why does no one seem to use old school wallet.dat files anymore and rely on third party services?
