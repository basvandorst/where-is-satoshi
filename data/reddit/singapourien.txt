DEBT BAAAAAAD.
no money to buy a house? NO HOUSE. no money to buy a car? NO CAR. can't get a new job that pays better because you have no HOUSE AND NO CAR? Well just kill yourself broke-ass loser. Only those who have anything deserve anything.
oh by the way bitcoin will liberalize the poor! pls buy more of these bitcoins with all your savings and pump up the price of the 10 or so that I already own.

Lesson 4: Imagine you have several children in the household. 
Your eldest son is in his bedroom in the east part of the house running a foreign currency exchange booth and financial planning business out of his bedroom.
Your youngest son is in the west bedroom running a web and mobile app shop and web hosting service. 
Your middle son is in the garden in the back harvesting tomatoes and carrots and grapes for the pantry.
Your daughter is in the toolshed designing robots and things.
every day they come to you to ask for stuff, "you need to keep the lights on longer!" "you need to stock the fridge!" "you need to upgrade our broadband!" "we need maintenance around the house" "you can't allow the drainage to back up!" "call the plumber today!" "call the electrician!" "call verizon right now!"
your kids are paying you an allowance, but out of that allowance you have to spend it on plumbing, utilities, repair, and also a little bit for Mom who's at her wits end trying to soothe fights and misunderstanding among all the children and you as well, and you are running out of cash.
what do you do...
do you say fuck it nobody gets shit from me? let them stop running their stupid businesses?
or do you borrow more because your family keeps making money?
