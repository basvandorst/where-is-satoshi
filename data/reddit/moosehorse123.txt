so if you don't have a desktop wallet, and you are buying and selling bitcoin on coinbase, who has the private key? 
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:20:00
Do you happen to know the details of how you know this? not trying to be an asshole just curious. 
What is it about the process of transfering bitcoin from coinbase to electrum that sort of "deletes" the information of that bitcoin address from coinbase
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:26:23
I agree with you, I couldn't come up with a good rebuttal. But is that it? Nobody's got a good comeback?
So basically its a time bomb until governments are threatened and then they can squash it easily? 
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:22:25
This is sort of what I assumed also. But i'm curious about the details. They can certainly get my information, but does the information of that specific bitcoin remain on the site? Or is my desktop account the only location with this information now? 
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:38:39
This is great information thank you. 
So each single bitcoin has a private key. Coinbase certainly knows this private key. Lets say I take that 1 bitcoin and then transfer it to Electrum. 
What happens to the information of this private key of that original 1 bitcoin? Coinbase probably still has it right? Can you change a private key?

So now there are more than one set of private keys associated with this one/or more bitcoins that I have moved. This makes sense. 
What would the terminology be for the password used to access the Electrum wallet? I thought that this was the private key? But this seems like more of a master key that controls access to all of my individual private keys associated with my bitcoin

I don't think its what they have been used for... but rather what can be traced to their use. 
you can't trace the history of a dollar bill in your hand. But you can apparently trace the history of an individual blockchain

JEREMIAHHHHH wats up dog 
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:30:35
I see. Thank you very much. This was very helpful. 
It seems that transferring bitcoin from coinbase to electrum would yield two private keys. 
The main security breach is now on my own online computer that holds the "new" private keys associated with my bitcoin. If you have these you have the bitcoin. 
However, from the coinbase end, you would need both the original private key that you would get from attacking coinbase, then follow to my local computer to get to the new private keys that were generated from electrum. Correct? 
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:39:35
okkkkk. this is getting a bit clearer. 
While your bitcoin are on coinbase, you essentially have 0 security besides coinbase. There is no private key associated with the bitcoin besides the one that coinbase knows.
once you transfer those bitcoin to your electrum wallet, now you have a new private key associated with those bitcoin that only you know. To spend them you need this private key. The private key is not attached to each specific bitcoin but rather the group of bitcoin that you have transferred. Correct?  
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:31:59
less concerned about my personal privacy, because I certainly agree that personal privacy is sacrificed by using coinbase. 
Is the private key for that bitcoin stored on the exchange? 
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:16:46
ahhhh. i see. Thank you!! So you only truly become your own bank once you withdraw those funds from coinbase. Generate your own private key, with which you can sign your transactions. 
My questions are definitely becoming more technical as I go. 
I'm a bit confused about the terminology here. I think the "private key" is essentially the password to the wallet containing the bitcoin. But what is the string associated with each single bitcoin called? 
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:26:09
What is the relationship between the withdrawal address and the private key? 
Not so much worried about privacy as I am about fund security
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:39:49
Doesn't coinbase generate a private key as well? 
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:25:51


so this Bitcoin address is like my postage address. 


My postage address has a private key. Supposedly the private key is the password set up when I make an Electrum account. Knowing this private key grants access to the bitcoins within. 
My main question is becoming: What is the security associated with each specific bitcoin vs. the security of a wallet. Is the private key referring to the whole wallet or the specific bitcoin within?  
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:03:55
yea. I think this is a hard one to get around. If a country goes after businesses that accept bitcoin, how would bitcoin survive?
