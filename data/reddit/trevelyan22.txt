Restricting the number of transactions limits the number of bitcoin nodes by undermining use cases and attacks the security of the network by capping miner revenue (unless fees reach 10 USD per transaction miners will eventually leave).
No-one is criticizing the existence of sidechains. People are quite rightly upset because limiting bitcoin to 200,000 transactions attacks the security of the network and the value of their holdings.

Yes it was. The risk of reversal for 0-conf transactions diminishes over time in accellerating fashion so that in practice even a few seconds head start is enough to make a reversal extremely unlikely. This is why double-spending is hard work: if a transaction isn't re-broadcast within a few seconds users basically need to collude with mining pools and get lucky, which isn't a threat for most peer-to-peer payments.
RBF changes this so that transactions are totally unsafe until about the 10-minute mark, and THEN we go back to the same risk/security function. Design-wise, the change is the equivalent of putting a chargeback button right on someone's credit card, so they can reverse their payment as soon as they walk out of the store without even the need to collude with the bank. 
The change makes no sense. The risk of "chargebacks" with bitcoin are already lower than for credit cards. A non-existent problem is being used to justify making all transactions a lot less secure, which is funny because no-one is complaining about how unsafe credit cards are and how maybe banks should fix them so everyone has to wait 10-20 minutes at the cashier before their payment clears....

This "concern" about centralization is a total red herring, because if there is a bigger blockchain than bitcoin, it doesn't matter how decentralized bitcoin remains, because it is now vulnerable to a 51% attack.
Giving up fees and use-cases (to another blockchain) does not provide any security: it just pushes hashing power elsewhere. And the whole complaint is ironic too, since if the other network ends up being more centralized then bitcoin is by definition even more vulnerable to attack since fewer people need to collude to pull one off.
It is inconvenient for those with ulterior agendas that require jacking up the price of bitcoin transactions, but we maximize decentralization by keeping costs low and maximizing the number of people using the blockchain, not pushing transactions to other coins and building sidechains that steal miner revenue and weaken network hash power.

If your home network is that crippled you won't be able to download the blockchain regardless of blocksize.
I live in China and you can cheaply and easily get 50-100 mbps uncapped connections right to your home. Americans may be getting screwed by their telco companies, but that isn't a good reason to cripple bitcoin so it cannot become a global payments network. Also, I pay 50 USD monthly for something like 10 terabytes of bandwidth at my ISP in Los Angeles. They route directly into the global backbone, and their relatively high cost is only because I haven't upgraded my server in a couple of years.

Exactly. 
No-one will pay 8 USD per transaction. 
People will only bid maybe 0.10 USD at most.
At full capacity that gives miners max revenue of 20,000 USD per block, which is a lot less money than they are making now.

The problem with the Lightning Network is that the technology works by creating a series of smart contracts which reflect a changing balance. Both parties commit an amount of bitcoin which gets redistributed back and forth over time before someone clears it by executing the contract on the blockchain.
Unless I'm mistaken, this means that LN only works better than vanilla bitcoin in cases where both parties *want* a long-term relationship or expect to conduct all transactions through a single middleman, which is great for certain kinds of microtransactions and asset swaps, but not for most other types of transactions since it requires up-front payment of more than the amount required, adds unnecessary fees to many transactions, and requires customers to keep their wealth in bitcoin by making liquidating difficult.
Mike Hearn is right -- who are the customers for this? Who will keep their wealth in bitcoin under these circumstances? With limited capacity and high fees the network won't be secure since there won't be the transaction volume to support miners. And bitcoin won't be as liquid as other assets since normal people won't buy it -- no-one is going to pay 10 USD to withdraw coins from an exchange only to pay another 10 USD to send them to a merchant who will need to pay another 10 USD to liquidate. The existing financial system is more competitive, even for microtransactions.
@_date: 2015-12-25 05:24:53
By that logic there aren't any monetary uses of bitcoin that will pay 10 USD per transaction (the current cost) because even the legacy banking system is cheaper than that. So you are making bitcoin useful for exactly no-one.
In contrast, "non-legitimate" but fee-paying applications actually exist today and only need to scale past a million transactions daily to pose an existential threat to the bitcoin network at much lower fees. At that point they, rather than bitcoin or sidechains, would be the obvious choice for store of value and payment purposes, not least because a small mining pool from the larger network could easily reverse whatever bitcoin transactions they wanted.

They are changing the design by blocking a long-planned blocksize increase that would spread the cost of supporting miners among more transactions. In the long run, this will kill BTC by making onchain transactions uncompetitive (in both price and security) relative to other blockchains.

@_date: 2015-12-31 22:18:50
This doesn't avoid the problem....
Keeping the network secure requires enough competition to push transaction fees up to 5 USD. If the only people willing to pay that are the people using sidechains then you have a major problem, because even if you hit that figure the fact that you hit it means that sidechains are broken and there are a ton of transactions that aren't reliably clearing.
You need to find a category of user that is willing to pay up to 5 USD per transaction but who is willing to be priced out of the market at that point and who won't shift to a different blockchain. And this is not going to happen at such a high price since (1) automated systems will use a cheaper blockchain with greater capacity anyway, and (2) at that point the legacy banking system (or even Western Union) is significantly cheaper for transferring funds.

Bitcoin is not really useful if it can only process 200k transactions daily. The price will keep going up when the blocksize is raised, only question is how much damage is done to Bitcoin in the meantime and whether it will be fixable.

For an extreme example, compare miner revenue at 100M versus 1M blocks.
100M blocks with transactions that pay 0.05 cents each gets miners 1 million USD in revenue per block. At 1M blocks the price needs to reach 5 USD per transaction to offer the same revenue to miners.
Who is going to pay 5 USD per transaction? Unless there is a good answer to this question, the blockchain will become insecure. Because either the sidechains breakdown when the blocks fill up, or there isn't enough non-sidechain usage to push up fees, in which case the sidechain is undermining the security of the network.

That's too bad. Bitcoin-J and Lighthouse are both excellent projects released under an open license. I've used the code for both personally and have a lot of respect for Hearn, although I've never interacted with him in person.
Ideologically, I don't see how bitcoin can survive without an increase in the blocksize since it currently costs 8 USD per transaction to maintain current levels of network security ( None of my bitcoin-using customers will pay more than a few cents to move money so I'm not sure who is going to pay the miners if bitcoin is restricted from growing into a consumer-grade payments network.

We've processed around two hundred transactions. Mostly smaller fractions of a bitcoin and no more than 200 BTC collected in total, but enough to have a pretty good sense of real world customer behavior and how the risk of accepting bitcoin compares to other payment methods like credit cards. For the larger transfers you wait, for the smaller ones you rely on heuristics about who is likely to rip you off, security through first-propagation and the fact that in the real world it simply isn't worth someone's time to try and double-spend a smaller purchase. 
We accept bitcoin to support bitcoin. If double-spending becomes a problem and the fraud/cost rate rises above that of credit cards we will simply stop taking bitcoin, which is why RBF is an actual problem for merchant adoption. I can't afford to have my staff sit around watching small transactions for 10 minutes like a supermarket cashier who who can handle one customer every ten minutes.
Either way, it is ironic that you are warning against double-spending wallets (and associating them with virii) when you are advocating the development of double-spending as a feature, and implemented in such a way as to not only make it easy for even the least technical user to reverse the most trivial of purchases, but also undermine the major technical advantage that 0-conf merchants have when accepting such payments (the ability to aggressively rebroadcast to miners).

This is not true, because it is easier to scale up transactions by 1-2 orders of magnitude than it is to scale up fees by the same amount. 
People are simply not going to pay 100x current transaction fees. But we can scale the tech up to that level no problem. Samsung's new 16 TB drive has enough space to store the entire throughput of the VISA network (100 MB blocks) for more than three years. An array of 10 disks would provide more than a quarter century of storage capacity. Add on LN and other optimizations and we leave VISA in the dust.

Decrease overall revenue (as the block reward falls) and there will be less incentive to mine. Network security will collapse to the point miners make enough money to support themselves.

Proof of work does not result in high fees. Competition to use a network results in high fees.
Refusal to increase blocksize could easily push payments and other services onto an alternate network. Growing transaction fees there could easily make such a network more lucrative for miners, rending bitcoin insecure while lowering transaction costs below what bitcoin and LN charge.

Or stock registration and trading. Or programmatic-money on distributed power-grids. Or online gambling, colored coins, IPR registration, interest payments to crowd-funded technical services, or anonymous online subscriptions, or copyright registration, or advertising networks and loyalty rewards programs, etc. etc.
How confident are you that none of these things will end up using blockchain tech? How confident are you that the people who design these systems will be happy to pay 10 USD to use the bitcoin blockchain, especially if it is able to process at most maybe one transaction a year per customer?
I know you are a long-standing member of the bitcoin community here, so it is strange to hear you voice skepticism that there are actual use cases for bitcoin. Especially since as long as there is ANY demand for transactions that will not pay 10 USD for processing or require greater transaction volume, there will be competing networks that will take those transactions, and when the fees from those transactions eventually dwarf bitcoin's capped and crippled revenue stream, they will draw away mining power and render both bitcoin as well as any sidechains built atop it fundamentally insecure.
@_date: 2015-12-24 09:13:01
There is no need to re-write history. The limit was added after-the-fact as a spam-prevention technique and Satoshi and the community were unanimous that this should be increased as transaction volume grew.
I agree there are technical risks with a hard fork. Leadership is needed to manage the process. The needed solution is getting LN up-and-running and increasing the blocksize to remove short-term constraints on transaction volume.
But there is no world in which bitcoin remains competitive while processing less than a million transactions a day. That simply won't pay miners enough and ignoring this invites a hash crash when the halving happens. Without an increase in transaction volume whatever blockchain home appliances or autonomous cars use for programmatic payments will soon generate more revenue for miners and attract more hashing power than bitcoin, at which point a small mining pool from them will be in a place to destroy the entire security of the bitcoin network.

I've never had someone succeed with a double spend, putting my fraud rate with bitcoin at exactly 0.0%. Compare that with credit cards, where most online businesses have a chargeback rate of around 1% because people forget what they paid for or kids use their parents' credit cards, etc. And even if the chargeback fails you lose time and money fighting it.
Bitcoin is way safer to accept than credit cards. So I don't believe this is a real problem, and I feel confident saying that in part because I also don't believe I've ever seen a single thread from a merchant on this subreddit complaining about a payment getting double-spent in the three to four years I've been here. Maybe it has happened in some rare cases, but it isn't hurting adoption and the practical solution is auto-flagging double-spends to protect merchants, not making it easier for people to defraud them....

I appreciate the civil reply, but while transactions have costs, those costs are determined by technology and the market. And there is no evidence we are anywhere near reasonable limits to either in a world where my five year old server has a 100 MB connection to the net. All arbitrary limits to the blocksize do is put a hard cap on mining revenue and hurt network security.
As far as real-world use cases which get undermined by high transaction costs, one real-world example of a business model that does not work at 10 USD per transaction is the bitcoin exchange. Because no-one is going to buy bitcoin if it costs them 10 USD to move it off an exchange. And no-one paying a merchant is going to want to pay an extra 10 USD so the merchant can transfer their coins to someone else in turn. I suppose we can all move to sidechains and avoid this problem, but then who is paying to secure the underlying network?
The centralization argument is also a red herring, because it really doesn't matter if bitcoin remains *more* decentralized that other blockchains if those other blockchains end up processing more transactions. And as long as there is any network with significantly greater hashing power, even a small mining pool from that network will be able to undermine the security of the whole bitcoin network by launching selective attacks on it. 
As above, we do need sidechains and the Lightning Network for payment scalability, but they are only viable if bitcoin itself scales up large enough that average transaction costs get reduced by at least two orders of magnitude. The coinbase subsidy is supposed to buy the time to do this, not let us ignore the problem until a hash crash happens because mining revenue hits the skids.
@_date: 2015-12-20 02:39:54

Yes, but what is the "supply shock" in this context? You are confusing the supply/demand curve of a specific product (i.e. wheat) with the volume of transactions in an economy, which is a totally different concept (the velocity of money).
Doubling the amount of wheat produced would constitute a supply shock. Prices would fall and potentially even go negative as farmers need to pay to get rid of unsold stocks. But doubling the blocksize does not result in double the number of transactions. Nor does it drive down mining revenue nor force miners to PAY people to make transactions.

You are being disingenuous. Bitcoin was not designed with a 1MB blocksize limit. I have been in the community since at least 2012 and the consensus has always been to scale up the blocksize as transaction volume grew. The change necessary involves fewer lines of code than any you seem to believe are trivial.
I support changes to the protocol that enable Lightning Network, but not at the cost of crippling bitcoin or jacking up fees. Network security is paid for by transaction volume multiplied by average transaction fees. The former is limited by technology and the latter is limited by the market. Capping the blocksize at 1MB puts a hard limit on miner revenue far below what technology supports in terms of transaction volume, and it is dangerous to assume that there will be enough transactions to secure the bitcoin network at whatever cost is needed to pay for the largest hashing network.
No-one will pay 10 USD per transaction to secure the network when there are cheaper alternatives -- this makes bitcoin far more expensive than the legacy banking system for cash transfers. Unless the cost of bitcoin transactions is kept at or below what the market will support, core developers are inviting a hash crash when the coinbase subsidy shrinks.

JonnyLay is actually correct. 
Keynesians do believe that monetary inflation leads to price inflation, just not at the zero bound when the economy is stuck in a liquidity trap. Understanding this is why Krugman has been correct in predicting that QE would not trigger price inflation or cause a debt crisis, despite the non-stop baying of Austrians and libertarians to the contrary for the last six years.
When will Krugman change his mind? Non-trivial price inflation, a rise in private sector interest rates or even the expectation of major changes to inflation or interest rates in the private sector would indicate that the economy is no longer stuck in a liquidity trap. At that point, further inflation of the money supply would be pointless, and the Fed would shift to reducing M6 to curtail inflation as necessary.

Falling GDP reduces the amount of goods and services available. Think of what happens when a pizza shrinks and you have the same number of people to feed.... In practice, the unemployed no longer eat (demand falls) and pizza gets more expensive as the remaining people with jobs compete for the smaller number of slices available (the price rises relative to wages).
It is also factually wrong to argue that the Fed caused the crisis on Wall Street. Low interest rates pushed housing prices up, but they did not create the glut of bad loans which lenders originated and then foisted on others (financial innovation in securitization meant that loan originators could now make money simply by pocketing loan-origination fees, and avoid holding any risk themselves -- which was the major reason for the deceptive teaser rates which would eventually spike -- they were designed to result in more fees when people were forced to refinance). Nor did the Fed have anything to do with the Wall Street companies which bought these mortgages and re-wrapped them into newly-rated "triple-A" securities which hide the massive risk of default through the misapplication of risk models. Nor did the Fed create even a single one of the billions upon billions of dollars worth of CDSs which Wall Street pumped out of thin air to mirror the performance of these housing CDOs since *there were not actually enough actual bad mortgages to meet the demand for these "triple-A" securities which seemed to offer a better return than alternatives*.
Put simply, the financial crisis was created by systemic fraud in loan-origination and then the mispricing of risk by Wall Street which fed the market because it was a cash cow and then took its own risk models at face value and started holding billions of worthless securities. And this is self-evident from the timing of the crash as well -- in 2007 the market woke up to the fact that hundreds of billions of dollars of financial securities were worthless not because of any activity from the Fed, but rather because when the original 2-year teaser rates on these new and dangerous mortgages suddenly jumped into the double-digit range, default rates rose above 5 percent and the financial models used on Wall Street suddenly showed holders of these assets as on the hook for tens of billions of unexpected losses. People were suddenly losing 100% of the value of securities that were rated as if they could lose roughly 2% in the worst-case scenario.
If you think the Fed was forcing Wall Street to generate and hold worthless assets, you give them far too much credit. Alan Greenspan was calling the subprime problems contained in 2007 when the vast majority of the securitized loans held by Wall Street had not had their interest rates spike or even come close to doing so. Like other branches of government, the Fed was not the least up-to-date on what was happening.

The more technical explanation is that when GDP falls the supply curve shifts inwards and prices rise. The less technical explanation is that you can't produce less of everything and still give everyone the same amount of stuff that they used to be able to afford. Since killing the unemployed is not usually considered a solution to the problem of too many people and too little stuff, prices for everything just rise relative to wages.
The other issues ("product quality" and "automation") have nothing to do with whether deflation is good or bad, because the overall price level doesn't determine what products people buy (the relative prices of different products generally does). To the extent other factors affect the amount of inputs into the economy they can of course influence GDP growth. That said, I hope we both agree that a future where people choose to work less is preferable to a future where people have to work less because unemployment is over 10 percent.

Sorry, most Austrians do believe that the money supply is the prime determining factor behind price inflation. In non-deflationary environments the relationship is statistically sound as well.
And the Fed can easily crack down on the money supply. Raising interest rates and increasing bank reserve requirements would quickly ratchet things down.

They are different. Hoarding involves pulling assets out of circulation. Saving implies reinvestment, so that the money is still circulating in the economy.

The simple definition of GDP is C + G + I in a closed economy, where savings is assumed equivalent to I (investment). That is covered in most Econ101 classes.  Google to read up on it for more.
Economics got to the distinction between savings and hoarding through Ricardo first, who pointed out that money is an asset in addition to a flow, so sometimes people just want to hold it instead of invest it, and their changing preference for hard cash thus changes the amount of money in circulation in a way similar to how a dam which fills or releases water changes the amount of water in a river. Classical economists generally ignored this and/or dismissed the idea that it really mattered that much, until Keynes in 1936 described how this could lead to persistently depressive conditions if economies got trapped in what he called "liquidity traps".
So I believe Keynes was the first to talk about hoarding instead of saving, since he was the first to really emphasize the importance of the difference (that changing preferences for holding cash among savers could result in differences in the multiplier effect and amount of money in circulation). His 1936 book is pure genius btw. Worth reading even if only for the grade-A snark he tosses at Mellon and his predecessors.

It is hard to take people seriously when they don't understand why deflation is bad and don't care to educate themselves about it. The reason has nothing to do with banks and everything to do with the amount of stuff society produces.
Deflation reduces capital and labor inputs into the economy. When these inputs shrink, output (GDP) shrinks too. So less stuff is produced, and society becomes measurably poorer.

Umm... the dollar went into "printing mode" because the money supply was imploding. All the Federal Reserve did was try to hold the amount of money in the economy constant in order to prevent deflation and mass unemployment. If inflation becomes a problem, it will reverse the process: tightening reserve requirements and raising interest rates to reduce the amount of cash in circulation.
The only practical problem is not inflation, but a drying up in the market for US government bonds. At that point the value of the USD would fall and imports would get more expensive. But it wouldn't be the end of the world in any practical sense.

He is a smart guy. Bitcoin is hardly dead, but are you sure he is wrong? It seems obvious that some of the sell pressure is from miners of other coins converting to BTC and cashing out.... This is almost certainly the reason the USD price is lower on multicoin exchanges like btc-e, for instance.

Historically, when the economy does poorly investors put more money into conservative investments in order to protect their wealth. The shift of capital into perceived safe assets like Treasury Bonds or gold (and maybe bitcoin in the future!) is known as the Keynesian "flight to safety". For not-entirely-understood reasons, this tends to reduce the amount of cash circulating in the economy, creating deflationary pressures and a falling money supply.
This is what happened in 2008, when the financial crisis pushed many major economies into deflation. Since then, debt concerns in the United States and Europe have resulted in individuals reducing their spending even more than normal, triggering further increases to unemployment, further drops in spending and even more deflationary pressure. This in turn has encouraged even more investors to flee to safe assets like US Treasuries. 
In this kind of environment, quantitative easing should not trigger inflation at all. What it should do is hold the money supply constant and thus counteract the deflationary pressures unleashed by the cumulative decisions of private actors in the private sector. This is the reason the market has been willing to purchase treasuries offering such low interest -- there is little perceived risk of inflation resulting from QE.

Exactly. Quantitative easing is designed to compensate for a collapse in the money supply.
I agree with your sentiment by the way. There are many other ways to stimulate the economy, and it is damning that the political solution in Washington has been to rely almost exclusively on monetary policy over fiscal policy or alternative solutions like mortgage relief. The reliance on the Fed is clearly unjust in the way it enriches the same banks responsible for the crisis at the expense of individuals who lack access to the same cheap credit. Hell, I didn't contribute to the crisis and would love to get credit on those terms....
With that said, the excessive reliance on the Fed isn't really the Fed's fault. The organization has been forced to center stage in part because it isn't directly controlled by Congress, and there are a lot of politics frustrating legislative solutions (i.e. Republic attempts to vote against fiscal policy were strategic as much as ideological). So the whole situation really puts thinking people in a hard position, since as distasteful as the whole thing is, quantitative easing is still much better than the alternative (economic depression).

In this case, the problem is Paypal's. This guy doesn't control the fee that is being paid or the options presented to the customer. If Paypal thinks there is a problem, they should remove the free-transfer option on payments to his account.
Anyone who expects otherwise clearly does not know that businesses are not in a position to help customers since Paypal monopolizes the process anyway. As a case in point, I've had Paypal LIE to me about customer problems making payments and only found out the truth because those same customers contacted me to ask why Paypal was telling them I was refusing payment. And the reason Paypal was causing problems? They wanted to pressure a new user into hooking up a bank account when the user just wanted to pay my invoice with a credit card.
@_date: 2014-10-21 05:27:08


Even if you hold the money supply constant, changing preferences by people and businesses to save or invest will cause changes in the circulating money supply. The point of monetary policy is to counteract these forces.
The failure of much of this community to understand this is why we keep getting puzzled posts asking why the dollar hasn't collapsed considering the amount of cash QE has pumped into the economy over the last several years. Conventional economic wisdom says that we will not see significant inflation until the unemployment rate falls and interest rates rise.

Yes. Deflation encourages unemployment and capital hoarding. Fewer labour and capital inputs into the economy result in less stuff getting produced. GDP falls and things get more expensive relative to income (less supply, same demand).
That said, there seems to be no issue with bitcoin being used to conduct transactions denominated against a non-deflationary currency. So the only reason this is relevant is that this community has a lot of people who have more ideology than economics. A case in point is the "frivolous" purchases argument, which makes zero sense since in a free market people are purchasing things they desire.
Japan did not have a rapid deflationary spiral in the 1990s although it was apparently in a small liquidity trap. Thus the high levels of unemployment and near zero interest rates.

Yes, it is quite an accomplishment for the banks. The theoretical question behind it was how to induce banks to lend when interest rates were already at zero and monetary policy was pushing on a string. Giving them money is... uh... one solution.
Not the only solution, and I would personally have preferred other approaches much fairer to people who happen not to be banks. But given the political situation in 2008 with Republican hostility to both fiscal policy and Congressional solutions (yet their passive acceptance of monetary action) I'm not willing to condemn it.

What a silly argument. The costs of mining gold are relatively constant whereas the value of what you can buy with it varies over time and is influenced by any number of state policies. This is why the amount of gold companies have historically dug out of the ground has grown in times of deflation, just like the amount of oil increases when the price of oil goes up. 
The only difference between letting gold companies print money and having the state do it is that you somehow don't think an increase in the money supply counts when the private sector does it.

The statistics on reduced volatility and more stable growth since the 1970s speak for themselves regardless of whether you find them convincing or not. So what happened in the US is unquestionably good in the sense that it prevented the situation from getting as bad as it could have gotten if the free market was left to its own devices.
That said, is what happened fair? Absolutely not, and -- like Krugman and most other mainstream economists -- I would have preferred an approach that stabilized the money supply without simply giving cash to the banks responsible for the crisis. Direct cash transfers to individual households would have been a better solution (let them pay off their mortgages if they like). Also a greater emphasis on fiscal policy and infrastructure rollout, although at some point you do have to deal with the fact that every Wall Street firm would have died without Fed intervention, and it would have been political suicide for any government to preside over that, leaving Americans the effective choice of banking with either the Bank of China or HSBC.

Not quite. The technical difference between the terms is that "saving" is supposed to be reinvested into the economy through banks or financial intermediaries, and "hoarding" is not.

Even short spells of deflation cause problems: a fall in the amount of goods and services the economy produces because capital is hoarded (instead of invested in buying things) and unemployment rises because wages tend to be sticky. These falls in GDP have long-term consequences since growth resumes -- when it does -- from the lower equilibrium.
Hardcore libertarian goldbugs on this thread like attacking Keynes but rarely understand what he wrote, or they would know that bitcoin is not a threat as long as prices continue to be denominated in USD. The interesting question is what happens if you get rid of the USD completely, and/or shift to have pricing denominated in an entirely virtual currency (i.e. USDcoin) which is pegged to BTC but does not actually exist.
@_date: 2014-09-04 17:16:50
No disagreement with your points about life, but the reason it matters is not because anyone is criticizing people keeping cash on hand (power to them!) but rather because classical economics (and now Austrians) insist deflation and inflation are impossible if the money supply does not change, and use this hypothetical theory to advocate socially destructive economic policies ("deflation is fine....")
The problem is that quite a bit seems to affect how much money is circulating in the economy at any time. There aren't any simple models that work, but it can be empirically seen that in times of slower growth, cash seems to get put towards more conservative uses ("flight to safety") that somehow result in less money getting used to buy stuff. I personally think hoarding is not the most important factor, but it is an empirically valid observation and that is what the article is saying... people with money (read: banks)  aren't investing it. This is why the Fed has been able to pump so much cash into the economy without triggering massive inflation.
@_date: 2014-10-21 07:33:52
Why do you think the Fed would have a problem with even double that? 
The problem in this scenario would be the depreciation of the USD compared to other currencies and the reduced ability of the Treasury to issue new debt. But that is a separate issue from how monetary policy actually works.

I'm a Keynesian and your interpretation ("Keynes wants to punish hoarders") is not true. Keynes was a member of the aristocracy and viewed the investing class with insouciance. He didn't particularly care what they did with their money -- the sort of strong preference for monetarism you are describing is much closer to Milton Friedman.
The parent poster is asking why deflation is worse than inflation to Keynesians. The short answer is that deflation results in less money and labor getting invested into the economy. This results in fewer goods and services getting produced, and this makes society unquestionably poorer.
The question of how best to solve this is something Keynes didn't worry too much about (he never presented a formal model), because the consequence of understanding his point is the recognition that doing ANYTHING at all makes society better off, even something as patently absurd as burying money in ditches and inviting the unemployed to dig it up. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 16:41:03
I am guessing that one of the reasons Krugman is skeptical of bitcoin is because of attitudes like this in the community. If there was a group of people that criticized me without understanding half of what I say, I'd be skeptical of their claims about the value of other things.
Either way, parent post is dead wrong in its critique. In the interview Krugman is clearly asked a loaded question that asserts that rates are "artificially low". He points out quite correctly that without full employment or meaningful inflation there is no basis for saying the interest rates are low. To the extent he says anything controversial, it is in his belief that fiscal policy (spending money) is preferable to monetary policy (giving it to banks) in a low-growth environment. That said, I suspect most members of this community are irritated at the banking sector enough to agree that they haven't exactly been translating quantitative easing into the sort of public lending that could bring the economy back to full employment.
As far as the last bit goes, I personally think Krugman is wrong on bitcoin, but not because of anything he says about it and I'm glad to see he is keeping an open mind. I'm also totally OK with a mainstream economist who writes in the NYTimes being careful what he says about an unproven technology prone to speculative bubbles. Bitcoin is revolutionary and may or may not succeed for a variety of reasons, but unless and until it has the legs to succeed on its own merits, it doesn't need Krugman roping in a lot of technologically unsophisticated users as sheer speculators.

This is not true. Keynesian economics argues that the relationship between monetary and price inflation breaks down in deflationary or borderline deflationary conditions.
When the private sector decides to hold cash and cash equivalents (i.e. in times where investments do not seem profitable) total spending in the economy drops and the monetary authorities can expand the money supply without stimulating inflation.
Additionally, it is worth noting that the Fed is paying interest rates on commercial bank deposits in order to increase the money supply and recapitalize the banking sector. Whether this is fair or not (I would prefer if they just mailed me a cheque), this is actually one of the more creative solutions for expanding the money supply and ensuring a capitalized banking sector, since paying interest on deposits doesn't require explicit Congressional approval and budgeting.
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:53:31
The Federal Reserve uses a variety of measures to keep the inflation rate near to where it wants. Their most important tool is adjusting the rate at which the government lends money to banks for short-term loans.
The system only gets complex when the interest rate approaches zero, as then other methods are needed to promote banks lending, such as paying interest on deposits. This system is politically unfair (non-banks do not get access to credit on the same terms) but it is not a conspiracy.
The conspiracy theorists here are easy to spot. They talk about how the government is "creating money" and how this is devaluing the dollar (hyperinflation!) but never explain why this hasn't seemed to cause inflation for the last six years, or why - if there were inflation - the Fed would somehow be powerless to stop it.

A good central bank regulates the banking sector and money supply to keep the economy growing while keeping inflation low. Historically, this has done a lot of good -- read up about The Great Moderation ( if you need statistical evidence.
Critics try to dismiss these achievements by blaming the Fed for the 2007/8 financial crisis, implying that monetary policy was responsible for the crisis. But they are wrong -- while it is obvious low interest rates played a role in encouraging borrowers to speculate, the problematic loans were things like no-docs mortgages with low 2-year teaser rates that soared to double-digits in the third year, forcing borrowers to either default, or to pay more in fees to refinance at lower rates (what the issuers wanted). These doomed-to-destruct loans were then securitized and myriad CDOs created on top of them as Wall Street disguised the risk involved and then deluded itself into treating hundreds of billions in essentially worthless assets like triple-A securities.
Timothy Geithner does not get a lot of love in this community, but the reality is that without strong Fed action in 2008, the economy would have contracted much harder than it did. The United States was the center of the financial apocalypse, and yet emerged from the collapse in much better shape than many countries with only peripheral exposure.

The inflation rate is whatever the Fed wants it to be, plus or minus a small percentage to account for the fact that it is not God and is aiming at a moving target.
If other countries start repatriating dollars in bulk, interest rates will rise and the dollar will deflate relative to other currencies. So imports will be more expensive. Hardly a big deal -- anyone worried about that should buy them now while they are undervalued.

Yes, people keep citing that essay because they just *want to believe* so very badly, forgetting or never bothering to read the original paper enough to even notice that:
(1) the paper is talking about "depression" because most of the time you get a recession not a depression with mild instances of deflation. Low or stagnant growth rather than sharply negative downturns in GDP. The fact that you can have greater-than-absolutely-zero-growth in a mildly deflationary environment does not mean deflation promotes growth. Think about it. Then think about it some more.
(2) the essay is selective in what data it includes and excludes because it is fishing for a null hypothesis. Note the way they actually remove the Great Depression from their sample because including it makes the results turn out poorly for them (hint: removing cases of actual depression from a dataset makes it difficult to find depression!)
(3) the data-set nonetheless includes instances of falling GDP triggered by hyperinflation and war. Seriously... do they think their readers are morons?
(4) even with all of this nonsense, they still get a weak correlation.
With all that said, the best reality check for anyone taking these wingnuts seriously is just to eyeball the US GDP chart. See what happened in 2008? Yup. Rinse and repeat that experiment for pretty much any country in any time period with reliable economic data:

I really wish I had fiat to purchase in this panic. From the description of the problem, it seems as if only miners controlling a very large portion of the mining network could possibly take advantage of this. And even then they'd need to time their transactions extremely well and know that the exchange is only using transaction hashes to confirm payments.
Realistically, simply searching something like blockchain.info to see if the bitcoin was deposited into the destination address would make it clear that a payment was made.

Well, the logic is Keynesian in the sense that Keynes was the first one to point out that this sort of thing happened (the "animal spirits" of private investors matter). But the approach isn't controversial in any real sense. Anytime someone talks about the importance of investor confidence these days they are basically saying the same thing. And Keynes is mostly attacked for political reasons by people who hate fiscal policy. Yet these sorts of ideas are what justify monetary policy too.
Practically, a lot of what has happened in academics since the 1940s has been various ways of trying to model the way the economy works to figures out the exact mechanisms by which the sort of vague pressures Keynes wrote about actually work. At what point do we say what kind of explanation still counts as Keynesian? There isn't a compelling mathematical model that works in all cases that I'm aware of, but no-one worth taking seriously disputes the existence of liquidity traps or the idea that economies can fall into subpar equilibriums.
Either way, don't take the attacks on Keynes as indicative that Keynesianism is incompatible with bitcoin. The only issue I can see offhand would be if all prices and wages got denominated in bitcoin, but this hardly seems realistic for a slew of reasons. In a worst case scenario, the government could also simply require contracts to be set in USD and then leave the settlement to the private sector in whatever currencies are most efficient.
@_date: 2014-09-16 08:31:24
Sure, but prices are set at the margin. The fact that altcoins have devalued considerably in terms of their market cap doesn't mean a lot of cash hasn't gone into buying them with BTC over time, while exchange prices do suggest a greater conversion of BTC to USD on multicoin exchanges.

I would not personally pick Venezuela as an economic model of anything, but since you choose the country, a quick glance shows three periods of negative GDP growth (2002-2003, 2007-2008 and 2013) over the last fifteen years, all of which correlate very obviously with the three historically lowest periods of relative inflation during the same period. Finding this data required looking at two charts. The relationship was exactly what I said it would be. And you can rinse and repeat for whichever country and whichever time period you want.
If you want data for countries where inflation is below the zero-bound, go and get that data. It is mostly historical at this point for obvious reasons, but if you don't know how to find it, Eichengreen's "Golden Fetters" has the most comprehensive dataset on this topic of which I'm aware and may be a good place to start. That book also demonstrates beyond any reasonably doubt using time-series regression analysis that in the Great Depression it was deflation which led to depression cross-nationally and that countries which left the gold standard started to see positive economic growth within about six months.
You don't seem like a bad person, but one of the things that makes bitcoin look badly is when its advocates do what you are doing -- publicly deny what anyone can eyeball from a basic GDP chart and then insist that the opposite is true based on fringe ideological theories that ignore empirical data. I do not mean to make this personal, since you do not seem to know enough about economics and economic history to even know when you are going astray (i.e. you claim M0 can guide monetary policy by predicting output -- when it doesn't and nor do other measures of the money supply -- a well known problem with predicting inflation which is why central bankers use "inflation targeting" instead of "money supply targeting" when trying to smooth output).

The real problem is that poorly synced local miners may get trapped on orphaned chains.

@_date: 2015-01-06 16:34:45
My suggestion would be setting a hard limit on the number of blocks that can be orphaned if a longer chain is found. Then set this limit to less than the number of blocks that can be produced in the time it takes for light/information to travel between the two galaxies/planets. 
This should reduce the probability of a successful attack to essentially zero, because as soon as your off-planet attacker knows a viable starting point to hash from it is too late for them to submit a guess.

This argument is based on a fallacy.
Picture an economy with 10 million USD in circulation. Now add 1 million bitcoin at 1 USD each. How much money is in the economy? The answer is 11 million. Now increase the value of each bitcoin to 10 USD. We now have 20 million USD competing for the same number of goods and services. This will cause inflation.
In the real world, we do not notice this inflation because the world economy is absolutely massive and the market capitalization of bitcoin is practically negligible. But it is a mistake to imagine that any increase in bitcoin's value is coming out of nowhere.
So owners of bitcoin may be richer, and they may spend more than they did before, but for every one bitcoin holder who is richer, there are millions of people who hold only dollars and are marginally poorer since their dollars are worth less than they were worth before, and these people will spend comparatively less in aggregate.
@_date: 2016-03-03 21:29:11
Negative interest rates aren't the same thing as deflation. In practice, what happens in deflation is that prices fall in nominal terms, but prices rise relative to wages, which fall more.
You are right that if adjustment could happen instantaneously in the event of a deflationary shock there would theoretically be no cost to deflation. In practice problems are caused by sticky wages, contracts, the costs of changing prices, etc.
@_date: 2015-01-08 08:27:58
This is not true. If you compare even a few GDP graphs, you'll see that most recessions are slow and modest. But that the relationship described above holds in them as well. The fact it is so obvious is the reason you can eyeball it.
Anyway, there are other problems with your post, such as the claim that bitcoin is currently deflationary (inflation is somewhere around 7-8 percent annually). But it doesn't matter. The only reason I posted is because I think it hurts bitcoin to be associated with empirically and theoretically fallacious arguments.

Entitled is absolutely correct. Everyone in this community who pays the recommended fees is entitled to have payments processed within a reasonable time period.

You are correct that if Facebook stock was readily used as currency, and people accepted it for goods and services instead of money, Facebook issuing a large amount of new equity would increase the money supply and cause price inflation, although it would likely not decrease aggregate demand so I'll assume that is a typo in your post.
And you are right that bitcoin is not really being treated like a currency. In practice, bitcoin has historically been more of a speculative asset that is sold for cash rather than exchanged directly for goods from vendors. Under these conditions, the extra spending power of "early investors" has come less from holders of fiat than from later or more unlucky investors. There has also been some redistribution of wealth to bitcoin sellers from the owners of whatever other stuff people would have bought if bitcoin wasn't around.
In the long-run, the bitcoin economy only escapes this zero-sum trap when the network becomes economically productive in its own right, and its existence supports activities which create greater value than the ones they supplant. As this happens, the value of bitcoin will grow as demand rises to capture the efficiency gains enabled by the network. That said, this is clearly not what people mean when they say silly things like "I am personally richer and buying more stuff, so deflation encourages spending."

The biggest problem is that it creates a new class of attack on the network that is highly bandwidth intensive. Just adding it requires the equivalent of 4MB blocks in a worst case scenario, which means we get less than 2x transaction multiplier for 4x blocksize equivalent. Yet if we can really handle 4MB blocks a blocksize increase is overdue and would provide enough capacity for another 2 years of growth without the need to push paying transactions onto competing blockchains.
It is not clear to me if segwit in its current form is absolutely necessary for sidechains or whether we just need to fix transaction malleability, but this new attack has big implications since it locks off normal scalability. 10 MB blocks are within reach already, for instance, but 40 MB blocks are not. Can we really reach visa levels of processing if 100 MB blocks require nodes to have the same bandwidth as 400 MB blocks? No-one is talking about this.
There are also issues if nodes aren't properly validating mined blocks (soft fork versus hard fork), since that gives more power to miners in changing network parameters arbitrarily in the future among other issues. And there are some economic issues as well, mostly not with segwit but rather with the decision to prioritize it over a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2016-01-05 21:53:24
There is already an equilibrium fee for writing to the blockchain and how it changes in the future will depend on many factors, the most important of which are the cost and volume of transactions. Since RBF does not change network capacity it does not affect the equilibrium. All it really changes is short-term fee variance, which may even lower miner revenue at the margins if it hurts usability.
All I am criticizing here is the tendency of defenders of RBF to pretend their attack is harmless because [insert handwaving about how 0-conf will never work]. This requres not only ignoring evidence of how people use bitcoin in the real world, but common sense about how merchants and customers make and collect payments, and what options are open to each to prevent fraud.

There's actually a very large difference, and the reason is that there's a sharp upper limit on how much bitcoin can charge in transaction fees (fees are set by market competition, not miners) whereas there are no practical problems scaling transaction volume beyond that revenue point.
If this seems counterintuitive, look out a decade. By 2025 a small array of cheap hard drives will be able to hold decades worth of 1 GB blocks. But it is a pipe dream to imagine bitcoin will ever charge hundreds or thousands of dollars per transaction. Transaction volume is simply more scalable than transaction fees.

It would be a bad idea for any government to adopt a deflationary currency for a variety of reasons. As a thought experiment though, the government could simply continue to accept its old currency in payment for state services and let the market pull the older notes out of circulation.
How? As long as the government accepts its own dollars, there will always be a market for sellers of the currency, since anyone who owes tax will be willing to purchase them (at a discount) to reduce their tax obligations.

You seem to think that the only collusion possible can take place between customers and miners. Yet merchants can also collude with miners to prioritize at-risk transactions. Such services can be integrated directly into corporate wallets along with risk-profiling and accellerated transaction propagation.
As with many defenders of RBF, your argument justifies undermining the security of 0-conf transactions by an act of intellectual deceit: pretending that merchants are powerless and thus no additional harm is being done by attacking them. But this is not at all the case. There are already steps merchants can take to protect themselves against doublespends and the incentives for businesses to adopt these and other solutions will grow exactly to the extent that fraud ever become anything more than a hypothetical problem.
Anyway, I would be interested in seeing the derivative you come up with once you incorporate merchant incentives. As seems rather obvious, considering that merchants should be willing to pay miners the exact same fee that criminals are (they are competing for the same sum of money), the cost of doublespending should asymptotically approach the cost of the contested payment, wiping out any real savings from doublespend attempts once the system is in equilibrium.
@_date: 2016-01-01 10:57:45
This is dangerously wrong. If 60% of network hash power disappeared, bitcoin would produce 2.4 blocks per hour on average. It would take almost three times as long as usual for difficulty to adjust downwards, and during the adjustment period bitcoin would only be able to process 40% of the transactions it previously could. That takes us down to less than 80k transactions daily.
If you want a doomsday scenario, now imagine the price of bitcoin falling when the network's capacity drops by half. The lower price of bitcoin will translate directly into less revenue for miners, who respond by shutting down hashing equipment. Soon our 60% is 80% or 90% and things start getting interesting....

The problem is that deflationary economies grow less than those not experiencing deflation. In fact, much of the time they grow at negative rates. So... you are now in the business of reducing social welfare.
And this relationship is so robust you can test it in real life. Go find a GDP chart for a relatively stable modern economy. Look for a point where the GDP contracts, and look up inflation for that period: it will be lower than usual. Repeat until you feel curious enough about the relationship that you'll want to understand it instead of explaining it away.

Um... his attack targeted a very specific protocol change. And his attack vector is hardly a practical threat since the entire class of attack can be easily detected in practice by simply having a wallet do a simple sanity check on the extent of network propagation before greenlighting transactions.
If anything, the fact that wallets don't do this simple check (or even bother to listen for doublespends) is a sign of how non-existent doublespends are in practice and how little incentive there is for anyone to even bother doing the work.

I was just trying to state orthodox economic belief. Deflationary currencies are considered harmful because deflation shrinks the amount of money and labour that the economy allocates to producing stuff. Fewer inputs mean fewer outputs (lower GDP). And when you have the same population but fewer goods and services produced, aggregate welfare falls.
If you want my personal opinion? Well... I do believe it is possible to have well-managed currencies. I agree that monetary policy in Europe and the US shows indications of regulatory capture and encourages a predatory financial structure. I think the easier it is for people to opt-out into alternate asset classes the sharper check there will be on monetary abuse.

Segwit is multiplicative, but not in the sense you think: it offers a worse transaction/bandwidth ratio than a simple blocksize increase, and that ratio holds regardless of blocksize. So it actually makes it more difficult to scale on-chain transactions.
The reason for this is that segwit multiplies the total amount of data that can be sent in blocks by a factor of 4x. Increasing the blocksize to 2 MB after segwit consequently requires 8 MB of network capacity, while 10 MB blocks require 40 MB of network capacity, etc..  This is why segwit is not a scaling solution.

It is truly amazing to hear of all of the work that needs to be done before bitcoin will be able to send and receive payments. Indeed, reading your comment, I was shocked I had been able to use bitcoin at all for the last three years. It must have been an extraordinary run of luck. 
And you are right that there is time, something I can confirm first-hand having waited a good 24 hours for a 1000 USD transfer just this morning. I only kick myself for not having spent that time writing up some proposals or collecting some meaningful data. But how could I even know what data is needed? It is so frustrating to wait and wait and wait and see fee-paying transactions not confirm for more than a day and yet not know what data might exist that could tell anyone what the network needs to do.
Hopefully in time someone will update the core bitcoin implementation I used so that it does the market thing of adjusting payments so that we can all send transactions again. Then it will be a bit like 2013 again, only maybe a lot more expensive because we will be more optimized. Or maybe we should just turn people away with sly wink and a "no bitcoin for you, dirty fiater". Then bitcoin will be sort of like that country that only had a 1 GB connection to the net but optimized itself right into being an information superpower.
Sunny days, my friend.

When the network has enough capacity and transaction fees are predictable this is not a problem, yes.
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:59:32
Makes sense. The flurry of public announcements followed the price collapse that was very clearly triggered by the NYT piece. Once the mainstream started paying attention to 1MB blocksize obstruction it was clearly game over for the influx of a certain type of dumb money and speculators reacted appropriately.
Once the network forks to 2 MB the price will go back up because it will be reported on and positively and the people who have sold will want back in. But in the meantime miners have shot themselves in the foot. About 200k less revenue for every day the price remains below 435.
@_date: 2016-01-28 04:16:32
Your post shows a misunderstanding of core issues:


Segregated witness requires 4x blocksize equivalent under adversarial conditions. 2MB blocks+segwit require the equivalent of 8MB blocks. 100 MB blocks+segwit (payment-level) require the equivalent of 400 MB blocks. So segwit introduces a new attack vector that makes scaling the blocksize very expensive.


Yes, it will have to be greater. And paid for.


If the goal is truly maximizing transaction capacity, we are better off moving to 4MB blocks (4x transaction increase) than implementing segwit and getting a marginal gain for the same bandwidth.


Thank you for agreeing that the fee market is senseless.
That said, given the lack of even rudimentary back-of-the-envelope calculations, it is impossible to take your preferences as more than wishful thinking, especially when lined up against less theoretical scaling approaches where the economics actually work.

I wouldn't make the bet either. It is important to wait for the fork and be confident it is happening before dumping the minority chain. Otherwise your coins might end up orphaned and your counterparty holds both on the next chain.
Very likely the fork, if it happens, will start with the production of a single block and then we see whether hash power carries it. It may take several attempts, especially if it prompts attacks on nodes, DOS, etc.
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:19:34
Dude, my first purchase was more than 3 years ago. In all that time I have never had a problem running a full node and paying the default fee the software recommends. And insinuating I deliberately paid 0.00001 per KB instead of 0.0001 per KB in order to save a half-penny or whatever on transfer fees is utterly ridiculous.
Blaming the user is frankly the stupidest reaction to this complaint. Recognizing the problem and realizing how ridiculous it is in the first place is the appropriate reaction. If the fee the client settles on is not adequate to clear a transaction clients should not send it, and certainly not the reference client sending it by default. Either the min fee needs to increase, or network capacity needs to expand.
@_date: 2016-01-06 04:31:34
How could you have posibly missed the one, or maybe two, posts that have popped up in this subreddit over the last six years complaining about 0-conf fraud in the wild? It is probably the biggest usability problem we face.
People who tell you it isn't a problem are setting themselves up to be ripped off. They are lucky to have us looking out for their interests. The sad reality is that merchants unfortunately cannot be trusted to make decisions for themselves on this front, that's all.

@_date: 2016-01-07 17:07:08
I didn't set the fee. The client set it at 0.00001 BTC per kilobyte, which is the recommmended level.
And why don't you take your condescension elsewhere. In the real world no-one has the time to mess around with changing fees. We accept whatever the software says is appropriate and expect reasonably fast confirmation. Perhaps it is worth your time to save a couple fractions of a penny by optimizing that stuff, but the rest of us just want a payment network that works.
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:36:11
Well, why is no-one filling my transaction since it is paying exactly the recommended amount? Are those of us running full nodes using the reference software all supposed to switch to SPV clients that jack up the fee simply in order to have our transactions processed?
@_date: 2016-01-01 04:46:37
Those transactions are pushed to sidechains or managed by legacy systems. For why would anyone pay 5 USD for a transfer when they can pay a few pennies to send the money across the Lightning Network or just have their bank send a wire for a couple of dollars.
We cannot promote sidechains as the scalable and cheap payment solution, and then base the security of the entire network on the assumption that people won't use them.
@_date: 2016-01-30 11:43:01
Just reporting the facts. There is an adversarial attack on segwit that requires at least 4x blocksize bandwidth, maybe more with large multisig transactions (9 of 9, etc.), but I am not sure about that last point. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:06:49

@_date: 2016-01-17 01:31:06
Pushing transactions to sidechains where they are not verified by nodes is the exact opposite of "trust-minimizing, censorship-and-tamper resistant". Additionally, by redirecting payments from miners to sidechain operators you weaken the hashing power that secures the network.
More generally, censorship resistance requires scale. If people don't have an incentive to use bitcoin and integrate it in critical applications (and the very idea is laughable at 200,000tx per day) then you can't trust the network. May as well advocate we all shift to using an ACID database with a couple of RAID backups in a steel vault somewhere. Secure by some definitions, but not any useful ones.
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:39:27
The fees seem to have been calculated at **0.00001 BTC / kilobyte** which is exactly the recommended amount. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:59:01
This shows miner revenue per transaction. Total fees need to reach around 10 USD over time for the network to be sustainable without a blocksize increase. And likely more since network security still needs to grow until we are safe from state actors.
Most people realize a 100x increase in transaction costs is not possible (usage would migrate to another blockchain long before). If you hold bitcoin and care about its value you should support a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2016-01-17 08:34:30
This is why nodes validate blocks. Miners can do whatever they want but if they don't follow the same rules as full nodes, nodes will ignore their blocks as invalid. And miners won't be able to spend the coins because clients won't accept them as payments.
This was Mike's point about soft forks. Once nodes no longer validate transactions miners can do whatever they want and you lose trustless and permissionless transactions, because who really knows what is going on?

Your lack of understanding of how segregated witness actually works and your inability to use Google is not anyone else's concern. Talk to developers or read up on the technical merits of segwit and you will end up with a more nuanced opinion.
The more sophisicated opinion of most developers is not anti/pro blocksize increase since a blocksize increase is inevitable. The question is whether segwit should be prioritized above one. The major argument in favor as you would learn if you bothered to do any research is the assumption we cannot afford a blocksize increase and THEN segwit because under adversarial conditions this order of events would put network capacity close to what miners consider their 8 MB limit (2 MB x 4 segwit multiplier under adversarial attack).
I personally favour a blocksize increase because I don't see any reason for bitcoin to go through a significant change in economic structure that threatens its growth at this point, believe that pushing up fees is unnecessary and threatens to marginalize bitcoin long-term, and also believe the scalability argument is weak: if the network can really collapse at 8 MB under segwit then a 2-4 MB blocksize increase that buys equivalent capacity is safer and more conservative. But thank you for the ad hominem attack and off-topic sports metaphors though -- they provide all the frisson of a live football/racing match without the need to leave home.

If a relatively recent version of the core client cannot know the necessary default fee to send transactions the underlying design of the fee market is crazy. This is not the bitcoin I started using and promoting to people.
The reference software should not send transactions that won't transmit in a reasonable amount of time. Absolutely not without WARNING the user and certainly not by default. If a customer paid with this wallet what am I supposed to do, walk them through "--reindex --rescan" and wait a couple of days for them to try again?
Totally ridiculous.

I didn't downvote you, but your position isn't grounded in reality. Fact check your position: how many posts have been made on Reddit in the past month by merchants complaining about doublespends? What about the last six months? What about the last year? What if we broaden the search to other forums.
If you want to focus on real problems, there are several orders of magnitude more people complaining about their transactions not going through because there isn't capacity or wallets aren't calculating the fees properly. So promoting greater fee volatility and reduced network capacity is basically the exact opposite of what needs to be done: it exacerbates a common and existing problem in order to solve a practically non-existent one.

There is no need to be disingenuous. Wallets will default to using RBF if only because that is going to be the only way to guarantee deliverability on a congested network.
Nor are customers even going to know what RBF is. They are just going to "pay with bitcoin". Merchants will hardly be able to say "oh, you set the wrong options in your config file" or "looks like you didn't click the instant payments checkbox on the advanced payment page" in part because the staff accepting bitcoin won't know how to do that either. And why should merchants be expected to go out of their way to collect bitcoin payments safely? They can already judge the risk of accepting 0-conf payments perfectly well.
It wasn't long ago when everyone would get excited that a new store started accepting bitcoin. We need more people to accept bitcoin for bitcoin to succeed, it is real hubris to find RBF-proponents actively arguing that we should shove more risk on merchants. And the situation is especially appalling since there are better ways to accomplish what RBF is *supposed* to do that wouldn't undermine merchants (such as only permitting the addition of extra inputs and outputs and not their wholesale replacement).

It is only a dominant strategy in one-time games. But real world payments are a repeated game, and wallets doing any fraud detection will penalize higher-risk users, incentivizing honest behavior.


I'm pointing out the conception of the equilibrium is wrong without considering merchant incentives, and once those are considered, theoretical justifications for attacking 0-conf transactions as impractical fall apart.

Aren't we the lucky one?
Strange to see anyone advocate spending 20 cents to move bitcoin around, since that is (1) more expensive that Paypal, and (2) still roughly two orders of magnitude lower than the amount needed to support current network hashing at current transaction volume. I guess the plan is to leech off the coinbase subsidy until it runs out and then either hard fork to keep the dole going perpetually or just switch to another coin. But have a nice day!
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:12:06
If transactions are priced below their cost miners will simply refuse to process them. Market mechanisms set the minimum price of transactions slightly above actual marginal cost.
The long-term rebalancing mechanism is miners with more costly storage/bandwidth requirements dropping out, lowering the hash rate and reallocating revenue to more efficient providers. Nothing to see.
@_date: 2016-01-08 02:59:25


I don't see supply increasing in response to demand. So either you are blind to the fact that market structure is in this case "designed" by code, or else you haven't taken economics. Because if by market you mean a system that maximizes the production of an item according to its relative social utility you don't seem to know what you are talking about, because you can't have that with supply inelasticity.
@_date: 2016-01-28 03:39:30


Then go ahead and do the math for us. You need to hit 6.63 cents per transaction to hit current levels of security, and probably 1-2 orders of magnitude more for future levels:

There's no reason sidechain coins need to be more scarce than bitcoins. All they share is underlying transactional security, which is provided by the bitcoin network at no cost.
If sidechains provide payments at a much cheaper cost, payments will migrate to them instead of bitcoin. If there aren't enough sidechain transactions to push up fees, miner revenues fall. If there are enough sidechain transactions to push up fees, the sidechain is by definition unreliable.
Either you kill bitcoin, or you replace it with two disfunctional payment networks.

Without a blocksize increase a hash crash could destroy the capacity of the network. Picture full blocks but only 2 or 3 per hour.

I introduce about 3-4 mainstream (non tech) customers to bitcoin a month, and consider myself having a pretty factual understanding of how people use bitcoin and what problems people actually run into.
In contrast, let's look at your "factual" assumptions:
* increasing fees will give miners more revenue than increasing the number of transactions
* RBF will create a fee market instead of making payments unreliable and pushing people to other payment methods.
* neither customers nor merchants are price sensitive and people will keep using bitcoin even once it has high transfer costs and low reliability relatively to other payment methods
* 0-conf is useless and people and businesses who are telling you it is useful to them have no clue what they are talking about and should be patronizingly told to change their entire payment practices (ug... the hubris).
* wallets will be able to predict fees accurately in times of congestion and [handwaving] will cause a bunch of problems to not be problems
* merchants will adopt bitcoin even if it means accepting a single payment will require an additional 10-30 minutes in support costs and staff time (not only waiting for confirmations, but also walking customers through increasing fees, checking what their wallet settings are, explaining RBF, etc).
* tech development is free, and changing a single variable in the code (max blocksize) is less efficient than making a huge number of highly complex changes to pretty much every wallet and bitcoin service in existence.
* turning away paying transactions to other altcoins won't result in one of them eventually collecting more in fees and processing more in transactions and surpassing bitcoin as the most secure network with the greatest hashing power.
* even if that happens (and it will happen) people will still use bitcoin as a "store of value" because there will be no risk of a small mining pool from the larger network screwing around with 51% attacks on bitcoin for fun and profit.
* there are no issues with having the bitcoin network run at full capacity all the time, and fears of a hash crash, etc. are overblown because... uh... because it hasn't happened yet?
* the most sensible response to the exponential adoption of a payment technology is changing the entire risk model undermining it and crippling the capacity of the network.
* etc. etc.
I could go on, but it's pretty evident your viewpoint is not based on any real understanding of how bitcoin works in the real world (i.e. the factors that have led to growing adoption since 2009), and you have clearly never tried to explain to a non-technical person why they should send you bitcoin instead of Paypal and walked them through that process.
Thanks for the condescension and hypocrisy though.

Two transactions cleared after 24 hours. The third remains outstanding. All paid the fees the software set by default, making this the **default payment behavior**. Stunning that you don't consider this a usability or congestion problem.
If bitcoin can't reliably make payments, the bitcoin network shouldn't be pushed over capacity. The network has never been this unreliable in the past three plus years I've used it to send transactions. The only terrible thing is that you seem to consider this acceptable.

Right again, captain. It was absolutely my fault for putting in the amount, hitting the pay button and letting Bitcoin Core calculate the fee. What a trusting fool I was. And how angry I am at myself for it!
In the future, I will check a few sites and manually change the fees based on some guesswork along with whatever information I can find in those proposals you mentioned above. It may be a bit more work sending money, but if no-one is going to be using bitcoin for payments maybe I won't need to send bitcoin as often anyway. And as long as we're building a socially optimal network we can be sure that bitcoin's future will have a silver lining!
@_date: 2016-01-17 00:59:02

Perhaps you can look at the section called "Reference Implementation" before blaming a user who simply accepts what the reference software tells them:
The fee is supposed to be 0.00001 BTC / kilobyte, which is exactly the amount paid. Even according to Blockchain.info that is supposed to be "moderate priority" which is supposed to work within 6 blocks. It has now been what, 90?
And yes, I am blaming the network and the people screwing around with it. If I can't send a default transaction with the reference client and have it processed in a reasonable time that makes bitcoin broken.
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:28:16

I cannot stop you reading vitriol into my comments.


Simple math shows that a two-order increase in transaction volume (100 MB blocks) would provide current miner revenue without any increase in fees. The network could fork to 4 or 5 MB blocks immediately to solve critical capacity issues and add sidechains once we have time to evaluate the best way to do that.
But this is incompatible with the current segwit-at-all-costs proposal you are defending, because even a modest increase to 4 MB blocks will require nodes to handle 16 MB block equivalents. And not even 2 MB blocks are safe unless miners can handle 8 MB block equivalents. So your preferred scaling roadmap has much worse scaling requirements than a simple blocksize increase and you are not even addressing this problem.
I don't know how to deal with the last paragraph. It seems fairly intuitive that the bitcoin network will grow more decentralized as usage increases, so if your goals are what you claim they are the last thing you should want is a high-cost network useful for at most one or two things. If this is a misunderstanding of your position, you can clarify anytime by providing empirics.
@_date: 2016-01-28 04:53:06
Statements of fact are not vitriolic. 
You are publicly advocating a development trajectory for bitcoin that changes the usability and cost structure of the network. In such a situation, not being able to produce or reference a simple model of how you expect bitcoin to function is a problem, especially since there are really only two variables that matter (number of transactions and average fees).
You cannot expect to convince others or address their concerns if you cannot answer these questions. Emotional appeals to authority are also problematic because they lead people away from specifics and degrade into ad hominem attacks.

Handing mining over to Bitfury (the only large miner that will unquestionably support Core) by chasing a fork isn't really a good idea either.
Better to negotiate a blocksize increase in the Core client in exchange for BU supporting segwit over flextrans. It could be done, would give us an orderly network upgrade and probably double the price and more than quadruple the capacity of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-17 20:05:31
After blocksize increase. Price growthstopped when capacity hit and "spam" (read: paying transactions) were invited to go elsewhere.
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:21:05
That's a real assumption. First because if Paypal was just charging for the costs of running a database it would be free. You also pay for organizational structure and profit incentives, and bitcoin basically eliminates the former and ruthlessly streamlines the latter.
That said, I'm curious what you think the marginal cost of a bitcoin transaction actually is at various transaction volumes? I'll admit I believe it can get below 0.005 USD with transaction growth, so I wonder where people get these ideas that bitcoin is expensive.
@_date: 2016-03-02 22:44:03
Your estimates seem off by very large orders of magnitude. 10 satoshis per byte is 0.0001 BTC per kilobyte. Given that every block has 1000 kilobyes of available space, that gives:
0.0001 BTC per kilobyte * 1000 kilobytes per block = 0.1 BTC
Multiply by blocks per hour and hours per day and you end up around 14.4 BTC per day. Your other estimates will be off by similar orders of magnitude.

What is hard to understand? Old nodes can't recognize segwit payments. Nor will they follow a 2MB block. So they will not recognize incoming payments either way.
Anyone who doesn't upgrade doesn't lose their cash. The same keys work on the new blockchain.
@_date: 2016-01-28 03:10:30
You don't even understand what is meant by liquidity. Liquidity is not created by speculation in the long-run. It is created by people buying bitcoin to use it, which is what creates arbitrage opportunities and motivates speculation on future demand. Put most simply, the only reason bitcoin has any use as a store of value or settlement medium is that it is useful for something.
Your lack of concern at 0.06 cent transactions (and celebration of priorities that will push prices up to several dollars per transaction) implies a total disregard for all but a tiny subset of use cases. Yet it is these use cases you dismiss which create the underlying demand for bitcoin and motivating people to purchase it.
By pushing away buyers, you make bitcoin less liquid and other blockchains more liquid. And eventually it will be goodbye to bitcoin, since it will be more expensive (to transact) and less liquid. And whatever cryptocurrency succeeds bitcoin will be the default currency used for store of value and settlement and it will be more secure too: miners will migrate to that network because they will make more money hashing on a blockchain that has more people paying fees.
It is not surprising that the price has been steadily falling since we hit the blocksize cap.

It isn't clear what is unclear to you. The existence of an adversarial attack on segwit that consumes 4x bandwidth was discussed at the HK conference and is not in the least controversial. As below, you can find information on it by searching for "adversarial" and "segregated witness" in any search engine, or talking with actual developers about it.
It is strange to be downvoted for pointing out the existence of an uncontroversial and descriptive fact about segwit, and especially while being the only one in this thread who seems aware of it, but I guess this is what happens when community management pushes informed discussion elsewhere: people aren't aware there are real tradeoffs involved in design decisions.

What are you talking about? Of course some high risk uses may need confirmations. How does that justify forcibly removing the security of 0-conf for everyone else?
The hubris of the RBF crew would be hilarious if they weren't a fifth column making a direct attack on the very users whose real world use of bitcoin has made it actually grow in use and value.
This may not be the worst form of parental condescension, but it is pretty galling for you to imply a profitable business can't make independent judgments about what it should and shouldn't do for payments. If those guys are accepting 0-conf clearly they aren't losing money on them as you claim.

You appear to have no understanding of how exchanges work.

@_date: 2016-02-18 15:45:49


Thanks for the insult! Fortunately, it was perfectly safe and using cash saved me over 200 USD in fees and 5 days of dealing with bank wires and exchanges. I would do it again in a heartbeat, except that bitcoin is replacing this particular use-case.


It's actually kind of funny you mention this, because just the other day I wired funds to someone from the United States. I'd suggested sending bitcoin, but they wanted a wire because their bank "doesn't charge wire fees" and so I sent it. But then they complained they didn't get the full amount, and it turned out that while their bank didn't charge a fee, their bank's "intermediate bank" JP Morgan pocketed a couple percent. 
Feel free to recommend a card that doesn't charge currency exchange fees while offering decent market rates though: that would be useful. Most of the ones I know offer free exchange but gouge you on the exchange, which is hardly any different.
@_date: 2016-02-09 11:54:48
I share your skepticism that mainstream investors consider bitcoin an alternative to government debt, and can't see that changing before -- at a minimum -- a blocksize increase permits continued transaction and price growth. With that said, I do think the post is relevant.

Demand creates liquidity. Liquidity creates arbitrage and store of value. That in turn drives payment and investment demand.
The opposite strategy, of raising fees and pushing paying transactions away from bitcoin to other networks, is destructive. In the long term, whatever coin serves paying transactions will be the most secure.
@_date: 2016-02-25 13:17:31
That you for unwittingly recognizing that no-one running bitcoin is doing so on a 28.8k modem, and we can very obviously increase the bandwidth requirements.

The recommended solution is to scale personal transactions using sidechains. Make a single bitcoin transaction for greater than the amount you need to spend, then trade that value with others using "cash" or another off-blockchain peer-to-peer barter method. This marries the security of bitcoin with the convenience of low-cost, instant transactions.

Maybe I misunderstood you. If you meant that fees are expected to be under a dollar that isn't "significant" since it won't pay for even a fraction of miner revenues.
I was assuming you meant transactions will cost a couple of dollars at least. But this is exactly the problem with people not coming up with numbers. It is impossible to know what they are actually saying. I think a lot of people don't even know themselves.

Not sure what's unclear. Liquidity is a measure of how easy it is to move funds into and out of an asset without affecting the price. It is self-evident that demand drives liquidity since greater demand means there are more buyers at any price level.
I'm guessing you're confused because there are various types of arbitrage. Maybe read up on "futures arbitrage" and its relationship with price stability. There are a couple of ways of buying and selling assets simultaneously across markets that encourage price stability.

Majority hash rate controls transaction admission to the blockchain: it is quite literally the market.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:23:34
Bitcoin can't handle more transactions. If blockchain usage continues to grow and ethereum attracts the business bitcoin is turning away it could easily supplant bitcoin. Shouldn't take hours to make payments.
@_date: 2016-02-23 04:05:59
1. You don't need to raise the fee if you raise the transaction volume. And it is far easier and more sustainable to raise transaction volume 100x than it is to raise prices 100x.
2. The "fee market" is a joke at low transaction volumes. People will need to pay 8 USD per transaction to provide miners with the same revenue (long-term) that they get today. [see 
Unless you believe that transaction fees can rise to double-digits USD without usage going to another blockchain, you are advocating a blocksize increase.

You can get 1000 MBPS ethernet ports most places. I've had one in my server in LA for a couple of years now and pay about 6 bucks for a terabyte of bandwidth.
No-one is seriously worried that network speeds are going to stop, right? Isn't the real concern the sense that Comcast and other ISPs will try to strangle last-mile access and that this will threaten whatever libertarian-minded home users are incentivized to run full-nodes? And is that really a practical scenario in a world where bitcoin is massively popular? Colocation centers will run nodes just to save users from having to download off-network. And if ISPs strangle last-mile access then they'll run their own nodes anyway if only to provide payment channels for customers.

When customers pay for products they pay for the cost of merchants sending those coins to an exchange, and then for at least one transfer at the exchange. So real fees to customers are usually at least 3x, making the real cost to customers something like 20 cents for a 4 hour transaction. Huzzah for payments innovation!
We could solve this problem by making bitcoin a payment rather than settlement currency, but that would require people to be able to spend bitcoin peer-to-peer and that aspect of the original design was dropped when we all voted to make bitcoin a settlement network instead of something actually useful.
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:07:30
Thank goodness we have serious people willing to save bitcoin from its users (who want more transactions), businesses (who need capacity to deploy innovative services), miners (who want more revenue), exchanges (who benefit from a payments platform) and investors (who want to see the value grow). Clearly, none of these people are innovating.

It is not true that "no-one knows" this relationship. A 100x increase in transaction volume will very clearly add nodes to the network under any common-sense assumptions.


There is a viable roadmap for a capacity increase and 100x transaction volume is more than sufficient to guarantee adequate miner income. There is no viable roadmap for increasing fees 100x.
@_date: 2016-02-02 09:37:47

Unless you can say what bitcoin transactions will actually cost you have no idea what you are saying. And good luck getting anyone to tell you what bitcoin transactions will actually cost under the core roadmap.
Scaling up the blocksize leads to a very obvious revenue source for miners and gives predictable estimates for likely fees. Conversely, most core advocates seem to expect the coinbase subsidy to pay for mining for the next twenty years, and have no clue how miners will be compensated when it goes away.
@_date: 2017-04-19 01:12:33
Back to night school for you my friend. Only miners produce blocks. You're confusing reality with something else.
@_date: 2016-02-23 22:57:03
1. It simply isn't plausible that bitcoin can add hundreds of millions of new users and businesses but not a single one will run a full-node.
2. At that volume of usage, people will have commercial incentives to set them up, just like with DNS servers.
@_date: 2016-02-28 23:45:51
This is why the market solution is an increase in blocksize. Technically inefficient operations will be out-competed by those who can architect systems actually capable of processing transactions.

We have staff collecting bitcoin payments manually. Had to teach them to do it, just like we teach customers to pay us in bitcoin to save on credit card fees. Adoption is slow but moving forward. And we have also had zero double-spends for the reasons listed.
Now instead of our staff just processing an order when it shows up they have to sit around for 10 minutes to check confirmations. This will increase the cost of order processing and cut our efficiency. And when we recommend customers buy bitcoin, we're now going to have to caution them about fraud right away. This change single-handedly adds 10 minutes to every single stage in a complex bitcoin transaction. It almost feels like the developers are conspiring against making bitcoin actually useful to consumers and merchants.

The funny thing is that all online banking and credit card transactions would be compromised long before bitcoin became practically insecure, and there is a relatively easy fix for bitcoin (change the hashing algorithm) that doesn't necessarily exist for other forms of encryption.
So practically speaking, the advent of quantum attacks would probably promote blockchain tech rather than retard it. After all, what other effective ways are there of transferring value online when browser security and web authentication is non-existent and you can't just pass tokens used by third-party payment systems?
@_date: 2015-03-30 10:29:01
Sure. You could write the data into the blockchain in any number of ways.
The challenge is more how the person who pays "learns" the secret. If they are using a custom-written client when paying it is easy to modify it to parse-out the data. If they need to use a normal wallet, you are best off just writing a web-service that creates custom addresses on demand, listens to them for incoming payments and prints out a secret key when payments are received.
@_date: 2015-03-03 03:55:55

This is an unfortunate title and Yglesias is being sloppy invoking Krugman here, especially since what he is concerned about is the same thing Krugman has been worried about for years now.
Since Krugman-bashers elsewhere in this thread miss the point, the fact Krugman is referring to here is the way Central Banks have a very limited ability to stimulate the economy once interest rates have already been pushed to zero. Yes, banks can do things like QE, but there isn't much conventional wisdom on how effective these programs are, and it is still basically like pushing on a string.
Either way, the question of how the Federal Reserve can stimulate the economy is entirely separate from the question of why the market is pricing various assets as having negative interest rates. Krugman actually has a pretty compelling explanation for this, which is that negative interest rates on assets like these are indicators of deflationary concerns and a Keynesian flight-to-safety, so it is intellectually dishonest for anyone to cite this as an example of his getting anything wrong, and especially when his critics have been attacking him and predicting a massive debt crisis and soaring interest rates for the last eight years running.

Last I was aware no-one was forced to lend EUROs or USD. Investors can always sell currency for other assets like gold. Or just stick the cash into a safety-deposit vault instead of lending it out at negative interest rates.

As a business owner with a Merchant Pro account at Paypal, I've had people ask me to send them an invoice so they can buy stuff from me. And twice after sending this sort of invoice, the resulting payment from the user (paying via credit card) has been frozen by Paypal....
Calling Paypal to inquire resulted in them telling me they froze the payment because of risk of fraud and wanted proof this was a legitimate transaction. Ignoring the fact that there is nothing suggestive of fraud when you get paid after invoicing someone, providing evidence of previous correspondence (the user requesting to pay) accomplished nothing and Paypal reversed the transaction and closed the issue. I only discovered Paypal was lying to me about the reason for the block after my customer wrote back asking why *I* was blocking the transaction unless they hooked up their bank account.
I'm not sure whether lying to merchants and customers or charging for services that are not delivered constitutes bad behavior, but it certainly isn't uncomplicated to make a payment using Paypal if one of the two parties to the exchange do not have established accounts. And it is by no means as easy to use Paypal as it is copying an address into the Bitcoin software and hitting "send".  Bitcoins are tricky to purchase but trivial to spend once you have them.

So you've managed to get deflation, but you're paying a price for it in the form of a sharp decrease in the amount of stuff your economy is producing.
In this situation, it is possible that everything will seem nominally cheaper as people slide down the poverty curve, but everyone will be poorer in your new equilibrium since there is simply less stuff to go around, which means people will have to spend a greater percentage of their income to maintain consumption. The only way you can get around this fall in living standards is if some people are shafted and forced to consume less. But why on earth should any society prefer an equilibrium that has more people in poverty and makes stuff expensive as compared to an equally viable equilibrium with higher levels of prosperity, cheap stuff and decent job prospects for those willing to work?
Let monetary authorities fight deflation, and let people who are worried about inflation transfer their fiat into commodities or gold/bitcoin/whatever if and when they are worried about currency debasement. You get the best of both worlds.


No-one is talking about welfare. And no-one is talking about debt. Just supply and demand curves.

Sorry, but labor resources are not scarce when huge numbers of people are unemployed. And capital resources are not scarce when people are sitting on cash and/or paying the US government to hold it for them. So now you want to claim that we are facing a commodity crunch? When oil is down $40 off its 5-year high, and copper is down 30% compared to two years ago? 
I'm game: can you name even a single major industrial commodity that is showing any sign of a commodity crunch at this point?

This is not even university level economics. This is first lesson in high school, where the teacher draws the supply and demand curves on the blackboard!
If the value of BTC rises to 1,000,000 USD and the amount of USD in the economy does not fall that is the equivalent of "adding" 21 trillion USD to the economy. I've told you this lowers the value of the existing USD, but since you do not believe me work through the example yourself: what might possibly happen to prices if you have an extra 21 trillion dollars chasing the same number of handbags, cars, apartments?
Once you realize that prices will rise, congratulations. You've now succeeded in having the epiphany that true wealth is a claim on a good or service, not a number printed on a bill. Your gains in purchasing power come at the expense of everyone else who is holding USD. So you have not succeeded in creating wealth simply by printing more USD/BTC/whatever. You've just redistributed who gets to buy the cars.


No shit. And since you're talking about the creation of the Euro (I didn't bring it up), you're talking about the institutions that were managing policy before the ECB existed and during the transition. The most important of these by far was the Bundesband, which remains the most influential institution in setting European monetary policy today.

OK, this is fair enough and I don't disagree with you overall, although I think you'll agree that this sort of discussion is not the typical approach to thinking about what Krugman is saying. And he is right in characterizing the bitcoin movement as largely libertarian.
Substantively, I do think Krugman's critique of the mining process is fair (cash transactions are by definition off-network and do not impose ongoing network, power or storage costs) -- it is just that he misses the sheer amount of human labor and capital investment required by the credit system on an ongoing basis thanks to its massively inefficient and rent-seeking structure and its creation of a whole layer of intermediaries required for something as simple as moving money around. So he is not wrong, and he is even pushing the debate in the right direction by framing the debate as one over efficiency. And I think bitcoin wins on these terms!
Also, I believe he is right about bitcoin not being a viable national currency (the point of his critique - because its deflationary pressures will hurt GDP and thus social welfare). But that doesn't mean he is arguing that bitcoin serves no purpose as an asset or has no other benefits as a highly liquid and transferrable alternate currency. Krugman doesn't talk about these other benefits (he isn't championing bitcoin for sure) and perhaps he does not see them, but his critiques are very focused in objection to a very specific bad idea (running a national economy on a deflationary currency). Maybe you are right that this makes him reflexively negative, but if so it is really a relatively soft set of objections. I think he will come around as BTC starts being used for internation currency exchange and then sourcing, since the efficiencies here are so great.
Anyway, thanks for the discussion. I guess I agree he is not fully on the mark, but I don't think he deserves any emnity from this subreddit. And I appreciate the thoughtful reply and cordial tone!

Excellent post. Just practically, one possible solution to this sort of thing is to open a HK or offshore incorporated business and get a business account with HSBC or another bank. I have done this for a China business and it is perfectly legal, although you may need to report corporate profits as personal income depending on your jurisdiction and percentage of ownership. That gives you limited liability and a bank account with full online access. As a bonus, you will likely not pay any corporate tax.
Total cost for doing this is around 2K plus a two week trip to HK while the paperwork gets processed. Purchasing a pre-incorporated business is also possible and faster and may come with a bank account too. And you may even be able to do BVI as well which is great because the books are not audited, but the post-2008 crackdown on US tax evaders has made it even harder for legitimate offshore companies to open bank accounts. Again, as a non-American running a legal business outside the United States this is one of the reasons I consider bitcoin such a positive development. No foreign government has the moral right to deny any of us access to banking services in foreign jurisdictions simply because of a crusade it is running against its own citizens.
Either way, you are screwed if you need to accept credit cards (AsiaPay or high-risk offshore providers who will charge 5% per transaction are your only choices), but getting a legal shell company is a totally legitimate approach. And even if you need to incorporate locally to rent office space or hire staff, you could do so as a subsidiary and have your overseas company pay for everything from your main corporate account.

Different government ministries will compete to regulate it (i.e. Bank of China versus Ministry of Information and Information Technology) and who wins will depend on inter-government politics and how much protection local companies get from local governments and ministries. It is probably a good thing that a lot of the commercial bitcoin activity in China is in Shenzhen rather than Beijing.
Just like with telecom and internet policies, this means that nothing much will happen for three to four years while the regulatory politics grind their way through the system. The only thing likely to cause short-term problems is if the central government starts to consider bitcoin a real political or economic threat to the regime. In which case it can act quickly and ban bitcoin. But it takes a lot of energy to mobilize the government that way, so bitcoin would need to be a real problem.
Eventually China will get centralization and monopolized regulation of bitcoin as one of the agencies (I would bet on the Bank of China) wins and starts to rent-seek (think fees on all deposits, withdrawals, real name registration system, etc.). But by the time this happens bitcoin will either be established internationally and undesirable to crush, or it will be dead and no-one will care.

Most fiat currencies are promulgated by governments, but there have historically been paper currencies issued by banks (i.e. Hong Kong) and societies where private IOUs have been accepted as coinage (i.e. American west) which would count as fiat. All that a fiat currency really signifies is that the money isn't valuable independent of its use as money.
I agree bitcoin has lots of inherent value that flows from the technical properties of the network and its cryptographic structure. And if I'm being pedantic, it's simply because I don't like to see this community caught up attacking critics who are technically correct out of ideological reasons. In many ways, bitcoin is a better form of fiat. We shouldn't have trouble acknowledging that. :)

You jest, but Keynes' 1936 tract is one of the hardest books to get through in economics, to the point that if you lose track of what he is saying you can find yourself one or two pages later wondering what the hell it is you are reading and have to backtrack and refocus. Very few people read it in general and I have yet to meet a single Austrian who has.
So slow and painstaking work, but when you pull yourself up to its level there are incredible insights (particularly wliquidity traps and wage and price stickiness and their effects on depressed economies) which no-one prior to Keynes recognized, and most people championing the Austrian approach today don't even acknowledge. 
In the spirit of know-thy-enemy, I am confident Krugman will come around on bitcoin because he *is* asking the right questions, and will eventually realize the power of things like N-of-M payments, near-zero-cost fund transfers, programmability, etc. which make cryptocurrencies so useful. And then question then becomes whether network effects protect bitcoin or will fragment its value across a thousand altcoins.

Despite your use of **bold text**, the opposite of fiat currency is currency with intrinsic value, like gold or silver coins. If you really think social convention is the crux of the distinction, you are in the uncomfortable position of arguing - among other things - that the USD is only fiat currency within the geographical borders of the United States.
Most paper currencies have relied on someone issuing them (thus *fiat*), but there is no hard-and-fast rule for what constitutes an issuer. In the historical cases where banks or corporations have issued private currency, said organizations have served as the issuing authorities. In the case of bitcoin, the issuing authority is clearly the source code.

Quasi-Keynesian with graduate-level economics education. Posting because this up-is-down attitude is exactly the reason the mainstream press looks negatively on bitcoin and if we as a community want to promote the benefits of cryptocurrencies that means not spreading this sort of drivel.
Here is the core problem with deflation. The goal of economic policy should be to make society well-off. That means maximizing GDP -- producing the most goods and services you can given your limited resources (capital and labor).
When deflation happens people hoard money (i.e. hold liquid assets rather than invest or spend). Unless you inflate your currency to compensate, it is dead simple to see that society has fewer resources available to produce stuff. The result is that GDP falls and society is worse off. Less stuff is produced and everything costs more in relative terms. Also, lots of unemployment while wages fall and you adjust down to this poorer equilibrium.
And here is why I'm bothering to post this despite the fact it will probably be downvoted to hell and back. Because from an economic perspective, there are no major problems with having deflationary assets like bitcoin play a significant role (like gold) in the economy. Bitcoin might even help mitigate liquidity traps and deflationary spirals since it provides a cash-like asset that people can flock to in times of crisis, leading to less hording of fiat currency and less need for interventionist monetary policy.
But do we hear about this? No. Instead we get repeated attacks on people like Krugman who are doing us all a public service by fighting a rearguard action against nutjobs who want to throw the US economy back into deflationary poverty cycles.

In a nutshell, the economy produces wealth by converting capital, labor and other resources into goods and services. Societies get wealthier either by getting more efficient at using these resources, or by increasing the amount of inputs available. In both cases more stuff is produced and real prices fall.
Deflation is bad because it promotes capital hoarding and leads to greater unemployment because of sticky wages and other factors. This reduces the amount of capital and labor "input" into the economy, reducing total GDP and consequently triggering a rise in real prices. This is an empirical relationship that can be easily seen in the GDP statistics country-by-country following the post-2008 financial crisis. Countries that embraced austerity like Greece and Britain had massively disproportionate and self-defeating collapses in economic output.
Don't be misled by the appreciating value of bitcoin. People holding BTC certainly feel wealthier and should be spending more. But that increase in value comes at the expense of other assets such as gold and dollars, which are debased as BTC becomes more valuable. The only reason this is not noticeable on an individual level is that bitcoin is literally a drop in the pond at this point, but what we will see is that as the value of BTC rises, those who hold only USD will be relatively poorer and will spend less.
Bitcoin will not cause problems unless it becomes the main currency in which wages and prices are denominated. So it will not trigger economic deflation unless American policy-makers do something totally stupid like abandon the USD, which is not going to happen.

I'm sympathetic to your politics, but poverty is a more pressing source of human conflict. There are plenty of countries that have neither inflation nor imperialist foreign policies. Whereas the history of Europe 1644-1911 is basically non-stop conflict.

I'm not specifying any particular utility function. Use whichever one you want.
The point is that regardless of what you consider valuable, someone who is sitting around unemployed and wants to work could be contributing to society instead of just sitting around being a drag on it by consuming resources.
Krugman doesn't bother to explain this because economists tend to agree that unemployment is bad. So if your recommended monetary system results in high unemployment and idle capital over prolonged periods of time (i.e. liquidity traps) then you have massive problems as a society. And it isn't Krugman conspiring with anyone. It is a problem that hurts everyone since everything gets more expensive (the same amount of dollars are chasing fewer goods and services).

99.9 percent of economists accept that falling GDP is a bad thing, since less stuff is produced and everyone ends up poorer in aggregate. You think deflation is wonderful, so are trying to claim the economy is STILL working at full capacity and the fall in production is caused by some "real resource" crunch.
So stop changing the topic. There is tons of labor available, and capital costs are incredibly low. The prices of major commodities like oil, copper and steel have fallen considerably.

Well... if a government is running a budget surplus or the banking system is well-capitalized (i.e. Hong Kong) it is pretty easy to prevent a run on your currency simply by mopping up any excess supply in international markets. And you can kill inflation domestically very easily by controlling the size of the money supply. Or even make it difficult to exchange currency through exchange controls in an absolute emergency.
So you only really face a potential run on your currency in situations where people who are likely to liquidate (outside investors) hold significant currency reserves and you have very little ability to mop up excess supply if they decide to dump on international markets (i.e. 1997/8 Asian financial crisis). And even in this situation, as long as your debt is denominated in your own currency, it is not an insurmountable problem because as unpleasant as sudden devaluation may be it also has its upsides and you can deal with the fallout through monetary intervention and preserve full-employment that way.
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:38:27


Uh... no.
The simplest version is that hoarding reduces the amount of capital invested into the economy. Then unemployment (caused by wage stickiness) reduces the amount of labor invested. Fewer resources going into the economy means less stuff is produced: GDP falls and everything gets more expensive as prices increase relative to wages.
There is no debt in this story for a reason: in a liquidity trap debt is a non-issue for sovereign issuers of their own currency -- they can borrow money at profit. This is something Krugman knew and his critics did not back in 2008, which is why Krugman was right and his critics were wrong when it came to making actual empirical predictions about American prospects for both inflation and/or a debt crisis at the time.

No! Deflationary currencies make things more expensive!!! Since I am repeating myself at this point, let me try to make it extremely clear:
* Deflation causes capital and labor to go unused (hoarding + unemployment). 
* This results in fewer goods and services getting produced.
* Less stuff divided by the same number of people == society is poorer.
You are getting confused because someone has told you deflation means things are less expensive. This is a lie. Prices for goods and services do eventually fall, but the same adjustment pushes down wages too (the "price" of labor). So things cost less in NOMINAL terms, but they are more expensive in REAL terms because the same number of people are competing to buy less stuff, and the result (supply and demand) is that it takes a greater percentage of everyone's income to buy the same stuff. In practical terms, this means that instead of paying 20% of your income for food, you are now paying 25%, etc.  Prices fall by less than wages.
The only way to lower prices relative to wages is to increase GDP.


I don't know why you think the Euro is relevant to this discussion. The introduction of the Euro did not trigger inflation because the money supply was controlled during the changeover and the Bundesbank has always been very strict about inflation (in part due to memories of Weimar). If Europe had simply added the Euro without removing older currencies from circulation, the printing of new money would have devalued the older currency and caused inflation (more money chasing the same number of goods and services). I have no idea what this is supposed to have to do with bitcoin, save point out that what I pointed out above is true -- a rise in the value of BTC relative to USD implies a debasement in the purchasing power of the USD.

Stop nitpicking guys. It's a sweeping generalization but is basically correct. And at least in the United States - it *is* illegal to refuse to accept legal tender in payment for goods and services. People have the right to refuse to make a sale, which amounts to the same thing as having the right to refuse cash, but there is a technical difference.

You seem to think that fighting deflation is "holding up prices" and thus wrong because people with money end up poorer if you stop it than they would be otherwise.
The problem is that while you realize that goods are priced in terms of money, you forget that money is priced in terms of the amount of goods available for purchase. So if you want to talk about the VALUE of money changing, you can't just look at how the amount of money in circulation changes. You also have to look at the relative availability of goods and services. And you are forgetting that under deflation the supply of all goods and services in the economy contracts. So you don't end up being able to buy more oil because everything is more expensive that it would have been at full employment, relative to your new price level at your new (poorer) equilibrium.
Even worse, fewer people working does not mean fewer people needing to eat, or fewer people who need healthcare or other basic services. So you are really advocating placing a greater economic burden on the smaller number of people who are productively employed, since greater income distribution (taxes, charity, crime, whatever) is needed if people without jobs are still going to eat.

It would be likely to fall for two reasons. The first is that people tend to liquidate even safe assets in times of crisis, either because of falling income or because they need to raise cash to cover other obligations. This is why most asset classes fall during financial crises -- even gold fell by about 25% in 2008.
The second reason is what Keynesian theories teach us: that investors flock to the most secure and liquid assets they can in times of crisis. It is entirely possible that this preferred asset will be bitcoin in the future (in which case the price may rise), but in 2008 the play-it-safe money went into US Treasuries. And it doesn't feel like perceptions have really changed -- at least judging from the tenor of the conversations in this subreddit, people seem much more concerned about bitcoin collapsing than they seem worried about losing all of their USD holdings.

As long as BTC is readily convertible to other currencies, it really doesn't matter what the price per BTC is. Case in point, right now I'm paying about 10 USD to receive international wire transfers and double that to send them through a business account in Hong Kong. I get charged a 3% fee for international cash withdrawals through my credit card if I need faster access to cash, and in both cases end up paying various banks for the privilege of conducting currency exchange operations at whatever (marked-up) non-market rates they provide. And this is if the same banks deign to do business with my company.
All of this leaves a huge amount of money on the table just waiting to be disintermediated, and bitcoin is the first real technology to offer the hope of disrupting this space.
Speculation is great to the extent it is encouraging the rollout of widespread conversion services and pushes global acceptance. But the real question is how countries with exchange controls are going to regulate BTC, because these are the countries where the most opportunity for large-scale disruption exists. Case in point, is China going to crack down on BTC because it threatens the foreign exchange monopoly of the Bank of China, or will conflicting interests protect it? And if the country cracks down on it, to what extent will that be effective if there are people in China who want to use it to move money abroad or make foreign purchases?
Speaking as someone who does business in China, I can tell you straight out that if BTC becomes widely convertible here, it will save the world about 1-2 percent on the cost of all product orders from China, with most of that coming out of the pockets of the Bank of China. That is a really big deal.

I agree that Krugman does not understand the real benefits that bitcoin offers its community. I think this is obvious because if he did understand these benefits he would be writing about bitcoin and other similar currencies as an interesting solution to a host of economic inefficiencies and monopolistic practices in the financial sector.
I also agree that its deflationary nature is probably irrelevant to its real value, except in the way it sets the incentive structure right and promotes early adoption, which is necessary to overcome the chicken-and-egg problem needed to make it actually useful.
That said, Krugman is right about what he says and his critics are wrong to accuse him of bagging on the currency. Frankly, they'd do bitcoin a great service by stopping the anti-Fed conspiracy theory and changing the story to one that focuses on the real benefits of the currency, like the way it can save businesses 3-5 percent monthly compared to reliance on credit card networks. With those kinds of savings, who cares if it is deflationary. Just don't run an economy on it.

Why should anyone believe you? Libertarians are and have been repeatedly wrong in their empirical predictions about the state of the economy.
As a case in point, according to Keynesian theory the cost of borrowing will be zero or negative in a liquidity crisis. This was an empirically testable hypothesis and was indeed what happened with US government borrowing during the financial crisis (the real interest rate on Treasuries when negative, making it profitable for the government to borrow). And yet even as borrowing costs were plummeting below zero, libertarians were moaning that increased borrowing and fiscal stimulus would cause a debt crisis / soaring interest rates / massive inflation.
Krugman 1 -- Libertarians 0
Or consider arguments about the need for austerity. Libertarians argued that austerity was necessary to promote retrenchment and recovery. Meanwhile, Keynesians like Krugman predicted that austerity would prove self-defeating. And this is indeed exactly what happened. Just compare Britain to the United States. Or look at the debt-to-GDP ratios of any nation which embraced austerity. They are much worse off.
Krugman 2 -- Libertarians 0.
Libertarian critics of Krugman lack all credibility at this point. Unfortunately for them, claiming that black is white does not make it so.
@_date: 2013-08-19 06:10:49
Yes. There is plenty of writing about this stuff. The best known case study showing how hoarding led to deflation in a micro-economy is the the Capitol Hill Babysitting Co-op, which started in the late 1970s and has been written about repeatedly.
If you want to look at macroeconomics, the "liquidity trap" is the technical term for the situation where people's aggregate preference to hold cash rather than save or spend results in a deflationary spiral. So you need to research "liquidity trap" rather than "hoarding" to find the appropriate literature.
The Great Depression is the most obvious and extreme historical case. For actual data (cross-national time series regression with N=32) you should read "Golden Fetters" by Eichengreen, which shows beyond any reasonable doubt that GDP recovery began nation-by-nation about 6 months after countries left the gold standard and its deflationary spiral. There are lots of country-specific studies cited in various papers by him and Peter Temin's online ( and many more cited in anyone who is doing academic research into it (i.e. Bernanke).
If you want PROPERLY CONTROLLED TRIALS you can't get much better than the different cross-national responses to the financial crisis in 2008. Countries which followed hard austerity and embraced deflation suffered far worse collapses in GDP output and much higher unemployment that those which - like the United States - used monetary policy and other methods to try and ward off deflation. The last five years also show the undeniable link between deflation and collapsing GDP -- you can google for the growth charts of any country and see that relationship just by eyeballing it.

Find an alternative that accepts bitcoin. Start using them, and close your account at the old business. Once this is done, send a polite email thanking the company for their service, and explaining that you are switching to a company that accepts bitcoin for (pick one) a practical reason:
* because you do not like being forced to pay VISA or Paypal middleman fees.
* because your business accepts bitcoin, and you wish to pay for digital services with them rather than lose money on the exchange
* because deceptive billing practices at the hands of credit card companies and other companies is pushing you to minimize the amount billed on your CC account each month in order to make false charges immediately clear.
* because of philosophical or political concerns over the banking system, or the Wikileaks blockade, or whatever it is that you feel complicit in by doing nothing.
A stock letter will do nothing. But when a company starts losing business they pay attention (for larger accounts they will often write to try to recapture the business). Increasing bitcoin payments for companies that already accept the currency also help reinforce the currency. So be sure to write your new provider and thank them for accepting bitcoin, and let them know it was the deciding factor in your support for them.
If there's something you can't yet purchase with bitcoins, share here and if there are other people who need the service maybe we can collectively convince someone to accept it.

To answer your final question directly: (1) yes, monetary expansion (up until the point of inflation) is a useful tool to pull a country out of a liquidity trap, and (2) I do not believe bailouts of the financial sector in the United States offer the most efficient way of doing this [the excellent book/film Too Big To Fail nails why].

No. You don't understand his writing. Read the two points he makes and tell me again which is a critique of bitcoin (the currency/asset) and what that critique is.
And again, please quote Krugman criticizing bitcoin's distribution mechanism. He raises a reasonable question in this second piece about the efficiency of having to spend resources/energy processing blocks, arguing in analogy to gold (which must be extracted from the earth with labor). Fiat is clearly preferable here, but only under assumptions that are probably not true but that have also circulated on this forum. How is talking about that unreasonable, intellectually dishonest or hostile?
Krugman isn't being unreasonable or crazy. He is trying to grapple with a new phenomenon by analogy to intellectual debates and issues he understands much better. I am betting he will change his tune once it becomes clear that the economic inefficiencies bitcoin cuts out of many transactions dwarfs its admitted problems. And that those problems are also benefits in other ways (energy is no longer used to mint currency or fight counterfieting, etc.)
Krugman is not a cheerleader, but he is hardly the devil and he is intellectually honest. The forum would be better served understanding and responding to his and other people's franing of bitcoin rather than villifying him and claiming he believes things different from what he says.

[1] The reason it is important that prices are not denominated in a deflationary currency is because that leads to hoarding (of capital) and reduced demand for labor because of sticky wages (Keynes recognized that salaries adjust upwards more easily than downwards although he did not provide an explanation). Both pressures reduce the total amount inputs provided to any economy (capital and labour) and thus lower the number of goods and services produced given arbitrary resource inputs.
[2] I'm not defending coercion. But you can't mix normative arguments with observations about what will work in practice, as Krugman himself points out. The economic problem is that without a level of base demand driven by people who want to use the currency, you won't get market-makers who arbitrage (over time) to buy when everyone else is selling and preserve a minimum price. I'm not sure if this is a really critical problem since there are currency crises even with state-backed currencies and the problem may be exaggerated (the deflationary nature of bitcoin also clearly helps), but it is reasonable to observe that if there is not a strong demand for the currency outside of speculative investment it is more prone to speculative panics which will undermine its utility as a store of value.

I had an application I developed (email mail relay using BTC micropayments to thwart spam and create a revenue stream for people receiving email) that I put on hold because of the decision to wipe out microtransactions.
Developing it made me realize how revolutionary bitcoin is, because it took very little work to actually make the "economic engine" tick. That said, I ended up not doing anything with the code because of the crackdown on microtransactions. This was an idea with good intentions (prevent the profusion of addresses with next to zero BTC in it which would need to be maintained indefinitely on the blockchain). But the "solution" destroyed an entire use case where bitcoin has zero competition and the current financial system is clearly inadequate.
In my opinion, if you are a core developer and want to help developers help you, as well as create an environment in which people will build useful applications on the blockchain, you should push to reverse this decision and permit arbitrary microtransactions as long as the receiving account already contains a certain threshold of BTC (enough that you won't get stranded BTC dust in ghost accounts) and is willing to pay whatever rates are necessary for transmission on the network.

Dispassionately, what does it matter how small a percentage becomes non-productive? Even a 2% hit to GDP means 2% less goods and services produced. Who wants to take a 2% cut to their wealth every year?


I don't believe anyone has "proven" the exact causal mechanism. Keynes attributed it to the "animal spirits" of investors and herd behavior and hoarding. Maybe he was right, but maybe he was wrong. Either way, the problem is that the dynamic he described: deflation eating away at GDP and making society poorer, is an empirical and historical fact.

Love the ad hominem, but you are wrong.
The value of any currency is defined in terms of what it buys. And since all currencies are competing for the same pool of goods and services, any increase in the value of BTC relative to the USD will be offset by a commensurate decrease in the purchasing power of the USD.
So - yeah - an increase in the relative value of BTC will make you more likely to buy stuff. But it also by definition makes everyone holding USD marginally poorer. So you haven't succeeded in conjuring value out of thin air and increasing the amount of spending in the economy. All you are doing is redistributing wealth to yourself.
As above, if you want to make society richer, you have to expand the amount of goods and services in the economy. If you want to talk about how bitcoin can help, you should focus on the role it can play making the financial system more efficient and enabling new kinds of goods and services, not defending deflation and foaming at the mouth about the evils of monetary policy.

When interest rates on US Treasuries went negative in 2008 it wasn't the government suppressing interest rates, it was investors abandoning other asset classes and throwing their money into what they thought was the safest investment on the market.
People sold other stuff to buy treasuries, which led to falling asset prices. Then as people began eating paper losses on these other assets, they had to start selling them to raise cash, fuelling a vicious cycle that triggered a stunning drop in prices in most asset categories. As cases in point, the price of crude oil fell by about 100 USD during the 2008 crisis, while copper dropped by more than half. Even gold lost 25% of its value during the meltdown, an inconvenient fact for goldbugs who insist that the market values it higher than the US dollar (apparently not!)
Like it or not, if the economy enters another liquidity crunch, the value of bitcoin will almost certainly drop as people rush to cash out their coins in order to pay debts, meet margin calls, or diversify their portfolios. You may not like it because you may personally believe bitcoin is more valuable than fiat, but it is sheer wishful thinking to blame the government for something that is very demonstrably the result of pure market forces. If you think it is a good investment, just buy when the price drops... if you have any cash on hand.

The fact that this discussion is playing out in the NYT blogger section is also fascinating. This is intellectual honesty in action, and it's happening in the public sphere rather than in academia. Krugman is a rarity: an honest intellectual who re-evaluates his views based on empirical evidence. So watch this space: when he turns so does the tide.

I don't know why you're asking for proof of the continued relevance of the Phillips curve when you simply could go to NBER (nber.org) and search for recent research on it yourself. The only time it washes out of *some* measures is during stagflation in a few developed economies post-1970s and pre-2000s.
But the fact it changes is not "new" news, which is why economists discarded the idea that it was a fixed constant relationship in the 1970s and moved towards the idea that it was an empirical relationship contingent on other factors (what are those factors? that is the sort of research people are doing). A commonly accepted explanation post-stagflation is that at least one factor is key: expectations of future inflation. This is why the Fed cares so much about managing inflation expectations. People agree that the relationship (and monetary policy) only holds when people do not expect inflation or deflation and adjust their behavior in advance.
Either way, using the volatility of the measure over time to argue that no-one believes there is a relationship between inflation and unemployment is silly. Especially today when the very people who have been denying the relationship have massive egg on their face over our current economic morass. These are the people Krugman is attacking (not bitcoin) -- people (overwhelmingly liquidationists) who have made constant predictions in mainstream media that massive Fed stimulus will result in soaring inflation and won't affect the unemployment rate at all. Yet ALL of these people have been empirically wrong, as even a child can see comparing the American experience post-2008 with austerity-torn Europe. 
As for the rest, Your point about soaring living standards in the (3rd) worst depression in American history is not sensible. American growth in the 19th century was a result of massive capital and labor inflows. Growth resulted from an influx of resources from elsewhere (the gold standard is irrelevant), and then the greater return to that labor and capital over time given its marginal scarcity. This is the same story as China post-1978 and most other developing economies today. We expect strong economic performance generally in eras where countries are rapidly introducing resources and "catching up" to equilibrium.
What we do not expect is for these sorts of economies to stumble into massive depressions without reason given so much wind in their sails. Yet that is what the gold standard gave us. And so even the ideologues at the Mises institute are stuck with the very obvious problem that the period they have picked as an example of great growth suffered the second or third worst depression in American history. It should be easy to see that output growth - however you want to honestly measure it - would have been considerably higher over this period if America was not wracked by high employment and cascading business failures for about six years.
Finally, because I actually know something about American railroad history, I can also tell you that the paper is dead wrong to imply that railroad expansion post 1870 and the speed of the growth of the capital stock there was in any way related to the gold standard. After the mid-1860s we are in the era of transcontinental railroad expansion, where explicit government policy (particularly land-grants but also direct funding based on hitting somewhat arbitrary milestones) drove investors to roll out networks at a pace unsupported by present economic activity.
Again, this is sort of the same story with China today, and it is the problem with taking capital stock as a measure of standard of living. Measured in terms of infrastructure growth, for instance, people in China are doing much better than they actually are. But if you search for things like Ordos or read up on the massive housing bubble in places like Beijing I think you'll intuitively understand why this is not a good way of actually measuring economic growth: the thing you're measuring as a proxy for economic growth is a result of very specific, and often government-led, market distortions.

You're making the same arguments that the Luddites made in the late 19th century. Yes, technology is disruptive and you can get structural unemployment during transitions. But these changes have not historically created a jobless society. They've just lead to different jobs and much cheaper stuff.
As a thought experiment, let's accept the idea that in the future there will be a computer network capable of doing almost everything that humans do now. Theoretically, we can conceptualize this like foreign trade: humans import goods and services from "computerland" and export something in return to pay for it (power? repairs?). As long as those exchanges are mediated by some kind of currency both economies will fall into equilibrium.
And even at the extreme where one person handles the maintenance of the entire computer network, the one service the rest of society can charge him/her for is rule of law and protection from harm.

New Trade Theory really made Krugman *persona non grata* across a great swath of academia. Having a qualified view of the benefits of free trade was not exactly career suicide, but it was pretty close to it in economics and is a good example of Krugman reconsidering orthodoxy in light of new evidence and putting empiricism above simple economic models and political agendas.
Intellectually, Krugman has two complaints about bitcoin: (1) empirical evidence tells us it is foolhardly to run a national economy on a deflationary currency, (2) unless there is a reason for people to actually buy bitcoin for reasons outside speculation, crashes and panics will reduce the price to zero.
A lot of this subreddit doesn't understand  because they don't have training in economics and couldn't tell a paragraph written by Keynes from a paragraph written by Friedman. But while Krugman is absolutely right about on this point (and many hate him for being the messenger), the fact that BTC should not replace the USD is irrelevant to the question of whether bitcoin will succeed. So the open question here is  and the fact that Krugman is focusing on it is a very good sign. The fact that he knows smart people who should eventually be able to explain  to him (once they understand what he is asking) is also good.
In my opinion, what Krugman needs to understand is that there are valuable services and transaction types enabled by bitcoin that traditional banking systems fail at providing (low-cost international payments, N-of-M payments, digital payments without risk of recurring charges, etc.) and he also needs personal experience using bitcoin to understand how it can be faster and easier than paying by credit card. When he understands that there is a reason for people to value using it, he will acknowledge that it can serve as a store of value *at some price* (since there will always be some level of demand) and the question will change to: are altcoins a threat to bitcoin? And on this point - especially given New Trade Theory and its emphasis on first mover advantage and network effects - I think Krugman will probably not see dogecoin as much of a threat.

Ask yourself this: when BTC appreciates against the USD, BTC holders obviously feel richer and consequently spend more. But what happens to those holding USD? It is easy to claim that the answer is "nothing", but this is only the case since there are so many USD in circulation that the effect on any USD holder will be minuscule (the debasement is a fraction of a fraction of a penny). On an aggregate level it should be clear that USD holders are poorer just as BTC holders are richer.
If this phenomenon is not obvious at current bitcoin values, consider what would happen if BTC cost 1,000,000 per coin and then quadrupled in value relative to the USD. The increased supply of "spendable currency" chasing the same number of goods and services would trigger a general increase in prices (inflation) as prices adjusted to increased demand. This increase in prices would be overwhelmingly felt by those holding USD, as the relative gains in the value of BTC would mask any increase in prices.

Not exactly. When deflation hits economies based on the gold standard mining companies expand production, something which eventually increases the money supply. The only difference is that the private sector is "printing" money instead of the government.
The reason this is worth remembering -- when Keynes suggested paying people to dig holes in the ground during times of recession, he wasn't seriously advocating such useless work -- he was making fun of his neoclassical counterparts (today's Austrians) whose solution to deflation was exactly this (paying people to dig stuff out of the ground).

Because supply isn't limited over time, whereas demand is fixed at any point in time. So as long as merchants can profitably restock it is very much in their interest to make sales in a mildly inflationary environment.
Your assertion that inflation does not hurt sales is also empirically flawed: in cases where currencies are inflating rapidly relative to the time needed to restock goods, we do see merchants refuse to engage in certain kinds of business and it becomes much harder in particular to get lower-margin items.

You may want to park your incredulity... fiat technically means "let it be" in Latin. So the term fiat currency properly refers to any medium of exchange which does not have intrinsic value itself, but which is assigned value through social convention: it is declared by those using it to have value.
So Joe is technically right. Gold and silver are not considered fiat because they are supposed to have value independent of their use as currency. But paper currency is fiat, and digital currencies are fiat as well, because if they were not socially considered money people would not ascribe them value.
I understand your emotional reaction -- Joe is being dismissive in implying that there is no good reason for bitcoin to have value. But a better response is not mocking his terms (which makes our community look bad), but leading the discussion in a direction that highlights the strengths of the system -- pointing out that bitcoin has meta-properties which are as valuable as the intrinsic properties of gold and which consequently make it an excellent medium of exchange.

It doesn't matter what causes BTC to appreciate against the USD in your example. The point is that your gains in purchasing power are offset by losses suffered by others. Anything extra you spend because you are richer is money someone else is not spending because they are poorer.


I disagree, but I'm bullish on bitcoin for other reasons and hope it makes a lot of early adopters wealthy, including you.


Even if society hits its saturation point, we still want stuff to be as cheap as possible so that people don't need to work as much in order to afford it.

I think economics is a science, if only because studying it leads to a very counterintuitive but empirically obvious conclusion: that there is at least one case (known as the liquidity trap) where you actually get a "free lunch" from printing money.
The problem that economists try to ignore is that who gets this free lunch is a political problem of wealth distribution. Monetary policy is preferred for this instead of fiscal policy because the former is perceived as being less of a handout to the poor and more sensitive to market forces, but the result is that everyone who is not working on Wall Street is now justifiably pissed that bankers are being bailed out while they struggle. And it is totally understandable that people are pissed off that members of society we perceive as unentitled to their wealth and over-compensated for their labor get a free ride in times of crisis because public policy is trying to prevent a broader economic collapse triggered by the irresponsibility of those very same connected individuals.
Put more simply, I can agree that it is necessary that SOMEONE get a free lunch without agreeing that the free lunch should really be given to the people who can already afford it.

The answer to  is not obvious at all, and is in fact counterintuitive, since it leads to the conclusion that there is exactly one situation in economics where there is in fact "a free lunch".

I disagree with your theory explaining the cause of the subprime crisis, but the disagreement is irrelevant. When the liquidity crunch hit, the value of hard assets like gold took a dive.
As far as the Reuter's piece goes, if you familiarize yourself with the history of the financial crisis (look at the TED Spread and other interbank liquidity measures), you'll see that the liquidity crunch hit in October. By December when this article was written, thanks largely to the Fed shoveling money at anything still alive (note: this is expansionary not contractory policy), rates had fallen back 60-70 percent off their October highs, and it was possible although still counterintuitive to argue that credit markets were lending.
Regardless, if you compare the peaks of those liquidity charts to the dates when the prices of hard assets plunged, the truth of what I'm saying will be obvious. Whether this is relevant to bitcoin is a good question and as a bitcoin user I sort of agree with you over the long-term, but if you want to argue that bitcoin is considered a more liquid asset than gold you're seriously blinded by your fondness for it.

My understanding is that his understanding of what fiat means is correct. Also that the value of gold in primitive societies did stem from its economic uses in coinage and jewelry and that its current value as an investment vehicle divorced from both has grown especially since Bretton Woods. Maybe you disagree, but this isn't an obviously flawed/bullshit argument.
I personally think the most interesting thing about bitcoin is that it is bootstrapping its way into a similar asset class as gold by promising more abstract and "meta" benefits like divisibility and transferability. But it is not silly for someone to disagree. If it were, the price of bitcoin would already be in the tens of thousands because there would be no perceived risk to holding them.
Also, Krugman is not a mouthpiece for the banking sector and has been repeatedly critical of the way the financial crisis has been handled. He is one of the few Bush critics who has also attacked Obama's administration. So opinionated, yes, but definitely not a political hack.

Since everyone is repeating the same stuff, here are a few random thoughts on why this is good that I haven't seen elsewhere:
* the declaration states that it is expressly legal to buy and sell bitcoin. So the major uses of bitcoin at present (speculation, asset store and low-level skirting of exchange controls) are protected. And even if they crack down on exchanges as financial organizations, they won't arrest people for conducting cash trade, so the spice won't stop.
* VERY IMPORTANTLY, the joint declaration is by five different Ministries and organizations. No-one is talking about this and so you read it here first, but what this basically tells us is that the Bank of China is not currently powerful enough to stop bitcoin, and multiple Ministries are already struggling for influence. This is likely why the policy reaction is so temperate.
* those with RMB are bullish about keeping RMB on exchanges like BTCChina. If they thought Chinese exchanges would turn into roach motels (cannot get cash out), the cost of BTC would have increased rather than decreased during the panic, because BTC would have been the only way to get assets out. What we saw was a speculative panic about prices on Western markets, not a native Chinese panic about the fate of local exchanges.
@_date: 2013-08-21 03:06:49
No-one is telling anyone what to buy. The economy will become efficient at producing whatever consumers purchase.
Either you understand the argument or you don't. But I can't make it any clearer. Societies that produce less goods and services are poorer than those which produce more, because everything costs more relative to income. Deflation causes society to produce less stuff. If you can't follow the logic, visit a supermarket in a third tier city in China and see for yourself.

Say's Law is the claim that savings are always equal to investment. The first philosopher to suggest that this was not in fact true was John Stuart Mill, who realized that people also treated money as an asset (neither spending nor investing it, as is the case with many bitcoin holders today). Keynes pointed out that this preference among investors to hold cash or cash-equivalents would affect the amount of spending in the economy and thus the level of aggregate demand / economic growth.
Keynes insight offers one of the major theoretical explanations for why increasing the money supply in deflationary situations does not always cause inflation (despite what Austrians continue to insist against all empirical evidence). We can also have confidence he is at least partly right given the otherwise paradoxical behavior of the US economy post 2008, which saw (1) a major increase in the money supply which did not trigger commensurate inflation, and (2) US government borrowing costs go negative as investors rushed to park funds in cash and cash equivalents.
With that said, Gordon's arguments are sort of irrelevant. You do not need to buy into Austrian economics to like bitcoin. And you don't need to worry about bitcoin being deflationary unless you are planning to run a national economy on it (which would be a very bad idea). There is no reason the currency can't play a similar role as gold or other convertible assets, co-existing with fiat currencies. As long as people have confidence in the long-term value of the asset, it is preferable to other assets in a lot of ways.

People spent money in the Great Depression, yes. But the reason any sane economist is critical of deflation is not because it is supposed to stop spending/lending completely (no-one says this, so you are attacking a strawman) but rather because it creates an environment in which more resources - particularly labour but also some capital - are unused. This makes everyone in the economy poorer because less products and services are produced than would be at full employment, which in turn makes everything marginally more expensive and lowers the standard of living.
With that said, just because you don't want to be running a national currency on bitcoin (you want to be able to print money when the economy falls into deflation) doesn't mean there isn't a valuable role bitcoin can play as an asset store and medium of exchange. It is perfectly possible to be a (sane) Keynesian and like bitcoin.

This is not true. Hoarding reduces aggregate demand by definition (capital inputs to the economy fall[1]) which means that fewer goods and services are produced. The resulting fall in GDP makes society worse off: either prices rise as the same number of people chase fewer goods, or some people are just forced to do without.


This is also empirically false. If you look at the chart of American GDP growth over the last decade, you can see that once the economy pulled out of its deflationary spiral, it continued along at its lower growth track, rather than climbing back to its pre-crisis equilibrium.[2]  So the long-term effects of the 2008 deflationary crisis are worth at least 0.5 trillion each year in lost spending/production. The long-term consequences for countries like Greece and Spain are even more horrific.

It is illegal not to accept legal tender in most countries around the world, so there is little risk in holding the currency as a store of value since you can always spend it on stuff available in the local economy. And when contracts are denominated in a currency (tax obligations or futures) there are always people who will want to purchase the currency, which again provides some limited guarantee of convertibility.
This is theoretically a problem with bitcoin, but it is not a huge issue to date because the pressure to sell that would otherwise result from a confidence crisis is somewhat offset by deflationary expectations, which encourages hoarding.
In practice, what it seems to mean is that bitcoin is fairly volatile for speculators, which is interesting since this volatility is exactly one of the things that makes it worthwhile for day-traders to play with, which in turn helps create liquidity for everyone else using it for trade.

No, your understanding is correct. But the reason Keynes picked that example is because this is exactly how monetary systems behave under the gold standard. As deflation hits an economy, prices fall, the relative value of gold rises and companies expand mining operations as mining becomes more profitable. Put more directly, when deflation hits an economy on the gold standard, economic incentives automatically send people to dig up "bottles of money" (gold).
Keynes expects us to realize his example is nonsense, but he is using it to make a greater point: if we are "stuck" burying money in the ground in ANY case (either with gold or "money in bottles"), why shouldn't we just save ourselves the waste and just pay people to build a road or airport instead?

See my reply above.

And then a lot of other smaller ones which are more contested (was it really a liquidity trap, or was something else going on, and how reliable is the data anyway?).
Denialism in this community mostly involves people claiming that deflation isn't a problem because prices, etc. will adjust downwards and enter a new equilibrium. Leaving aside the fact that they are empirically wrong in the short term (sticky wages are an established phenomenon), it should be self-evident that any economy with high unemployment is not producing the total amount of stuff it can.
