Agreed. Gotta think about who would be supporting a bull market if it took off soon. All the people who were pumping it last year? No. They learned their lesson. They’re gonna sell the second it smells like gains. 
It’s gonna be awhile. I’m really thinking 2-3 years. The tech and uses needs to be much further along than it is now to give confidence to the next generation of investors that it’s a solid investment.

It’s too fresh in too many people’s minds how quickly it went up and then crashed. I wouldn’t be surprised if it were 4-6 years. The tech might actually take off and be in use for years before people invest in it again. I think, when that time comes, it’s gonna be huge though. Waaaay bigger than we’ve ever seen.

What use does bitcoin have in a SHTF scenario? If there’s no electricity or internet it’s less useful than gold.

40 years, wow. Huge timeline there. 
In a global catastrophe where we completely lose power for an extended period of time, short of say, mass extinction, what’s more likely to have its value after the chaos dies down? Gold. The internet isn’t coming back the same way if we’re talking SHTF scenarios. A single brick of gold, even a box of jewelry, will be more than most people have. 
Don’t be a butter. Understand that crypto is not perfect for every scenario. You should own both.

It’s Illinois. Standard paid highway here. He has what looks like the ipass on his windshield. It’s actually half as much to use the ipass vs paying cash.
