It is also backed by a network of computers/miners that collectivately outvalue and would outperform the combined computing power/value of all of Google, Apple, Microsoft, IBM (insert any company here) network of computers combined.

And you're still up 1,000+% if you invested any time from 2009-Q2 2017

This guy is a moron and everything he says is wrong (watch his videos from just a few months ago on BTC, all of the sudden in Feb 2018 he is now an expert?), I can't believe he is in the security industry and has any fundamental understanding of code or cryptography, also stop saying blockchain is here to stay and bitcoin is not, you make yourself look more stupid and clueless if you actually understand what you are saying.

I had to wait 3-4 years to make any kind of significant return on my investment, why should all the johnny come latelies that invested 4 months ago already be in the green? Fuck that, take a risk and be patient like the rest of us had to.

You are a joke, transfering almost 1 million USD with no risk or worry for 40 cents in 12 minutes is a feature, not a drawback. 10 min blocks are a feature, not setback once again. You are getting non reversible, non hackable assurance of your transfer, something no other blockchain provides. BTC is only one going 9 years with no hacks, rollbacks or any nonsense every other alt coin has had happen or is going through. 
Let me see someone comfortably send 1 million over one single transaction on the token/premine centralized blockchains without sweating it.

If this is not any more obvious of a coordinated pump and dump (of BTC to BCH in a very convenient marketplace for Roger and his friends) to keep the price attractive while Roger Ver appears on Alex Jones today ...
In light of the recent SEC and CTFC hearings I wonder if there is anywhere we can report something like this now as well as the December 2017 day 1 Coinbase/GDAX launch debacle.

Yes but I think the collective value of the hardware and constant upgrades required outpaces and outvalues the cost of the electricity used. At some point if the entire world runs on solar/wind/whatever we can come up with then the electricity in itself is not a true source of value but what it is being used for is what you can measure agaisnt.

Dammit I forgot to put in the limited supply aspect, that is such a given I take for granted I forgot to include it for someone that is completely new to this
