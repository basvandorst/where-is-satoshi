It does not but current tax laws IIRC only allow the United States government to tax in USD.  This means if a transaction is entirely in Bitcoin, then the government or the body collecting the tax (usually by the merchant at the point of sale) would need to convert some of those BTC into USD to pay the taxes after the fact.  Alternatively, merchants shun that method and the responsibility is squarely on the shoulders of the people.  Now who plans on divulging what they bought with their BTC to the government anyway?
Transaction fees do exist, however they are entirely optional.  The fee goes toward speeding up the verification process by paying clients a fraction of the fee to verify you faster (giving you priority on the blockchain network).

I don't understand why the OP completely missed this in his post when referring to US taxes being high and people there being upset.  I suppose because people are oblivious to this issue.

Whoa shit you mean definitions are not inherently recursive?  To define complex ideas you need to understand the more basic ideas that are used to build the complex idea?  WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!?

Yes sorry.  Completely virtual currency with no physical analogue or component.

If we were not all in it for ourselves then where would the motivation come from?  No one is an absolute altruist.

Bitcoin is what PayPal planned on doing before they switched gears to their current model.
