you pretending that Core devs did nothing to scale bitcoin in 9 years. Core dev team is the reason why bitcoin can run at high capacity. if you ran still version 0.5 you would know the network would collapse by now. GAVIN??? what a joke! You are ungrateful and ignorant. go and read the release notes for improvements since 2012 when Gavin got out of the way for real devs.

SW is a part of the scaling solution. And it's not "Blockstream's Lightning Network". It's an open source initiative with about a half dozen different teams working on different implementations.

It's the developers' job to innovate. If regulators can't write laws fast enough, that's their problem.
@_date: 2015-12-15 12:39:39
No need or purpose for an instantaneous, trustless and massively scalable payment built on top of the bitcoin network? What sub am I in?
Bitcoin doesn't work fine. Confirmation times are a burden, microtransactions aren't possible, and the network doesn't scale beyond 100 million users, and that's being optimistic. 
There's plenty of trading that occurs between cryptos. The fiat ramp will be a real challenge for those who are not yet in the system, but there will be trading between crypto pairs that are pegged to fiat. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 10:27:46
Don't forget about the big questions regarding scaling. Either the blocksize limit needs to be increased, or new technology needs to emerge. Both options are at least a year away.

So scratch 'unreleased' then. These people don't even work for Blockstream. Relax, jesus.

It is trustless in that no third party can seize your bitcoin. I don't know how miner fees will be reserved so the channel can close. It would be pointless to open a channel for a single microtransaction though.

It's been argued that Bitcoin is a solution in search of a problem. I don't believe that, but I contend that the same argument is being made about Lightning.

Simply holding bitcoin is a potential conflict of interest.
@_date: 2015-12-15 13:48:26
It's pointless to pay a couple cents for a 2 or 5 cent fee. And that's arguably not even a microtransaction anyway. Lightning can send satoshis.

@_date: 2015-05-11 17:35:20
The problem is that ISPs are artificially constraining bandwidth so badly that it makes paying for a higher tier mandatory. Customers are left with the choice of paying a lot for a useless, crippled connection, or a lot more for a marginally better one. That's a poor choice to force onto customers in an industry that is devoid of competition.

OP was too cheap to pay a few cents for the privilege of having his transaction mined and stored on thousands of nodes for years to come. Maybe a generous miner will pick it up for him, but the fee market has to start somewhere and a few cents is more than reasonable. This will not make or break the success of bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-01-31 23:06:59
Storage is not a key concern in raising the block size limit. The concern is about bandwidth and block propagation. Anyone who *still* fails to understand that should just be quiet.
