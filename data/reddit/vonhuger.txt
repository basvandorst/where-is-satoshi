Yes Sir &amp; I would grab a little if I were you as well...

I haven't dabbled in the futures market but just ask your neighbor what Bitcoin is?... see if they have a clue so I would say it's still not mainstream yet.

Grab a portion Bro... you never know...

Or they keep enhancing BTC….as MasterCoin does...

When I first started mining with a 10Ghs mining rig, the difficulty was 300M or so…currently it is outrageous so if you have a similar rig, you should expect to mine next to nothing…my point is that mining is slowing down…as the chart I posted clearly shows...

In the longterm, it won't be necessary to exchange BTC for any other worthless FIAT currency…gold would be nice though...

"By 2140 there will be approximately 21 million bit coins" - do the math Bro...

Not good..

So more than half of the BTC float or 12M have been mined in the past 6 years &amp; the remaining, less than 9M coins will be mined in 126 years? &amp; mining is not slowing down?

Correct, so the amount an individual mines is diminished greatly causing me to have less coin so I now have to buy someone else's coins. Point being is that you don't arbitrarily create more coins as the government does with their FIAT currency which will drive the price of the BTC stratospheric in the long-term.
