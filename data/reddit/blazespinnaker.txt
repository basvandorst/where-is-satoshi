You don't store it on a piece of paper.  You store it on a USB and a piece of paper locked in a watertight safe.  You use a third party owned vault if you trust them, if not, you have your own vault.  Preferably cemented into your garage.

If rates go low enough, yes.  There is a spread however been the ask and bid prices.

it's not rational versus irrational, it's the reality that for many bitcoin = the mathematical manifestation of libertarianism, anything else gets downvoted...

Surprisingly well done for a local news station.

How do you do this in a user friendly way?

This is a terrific innovation and being based on bitmessage and btc makes it very simple and clear.   I'm sure there will be many iterations of this idea by many different people.   This is an excellent iteration.   This is also the reddit.comboard btw.

Control = Ownership.   What stops someone from coming along and bash you on the head until you give up the private key?  A Sheriff.   Jut substitute "land" for "private key".  By owning the private key, you own the BTC on the blockchain that they control.

What is it with journalists having NO CLUE.   The EBA said VC exchanges are 'obliged entities' which means they have the same reporting requirements that Canada has regulated.    Also, the EBA said only that banks shouldn't buy VC but it's OK if they provide current accounts for VC companies.  Cheeeeeeeerist.

The idea behind the laws is to discourage companies from deceiving their customers so they receive the funds instead.  For example, there is no incentive to vanish and not communicate with the customer because you're not going to be able to legally keep the money anyways.  
It's a well meaning regulation.   Most of them are.  Unfortunately, we need to let the blockchain come up with the rules of the road.   We don't need a government to do so.    Let it evolve.

It's not a troll, it's someone who just a few bitcoins and is now trying to pump the value of it, thinking his post on Reddit might help.   Please just down vote.

Positive, consumers hate those charges

Awesome, incredible.  How realiable though is Gamex BL-600 ?  That is the heart and soul of this system.   How well does it deal with crumpled bills?  Can it be extended for international currency?

"Companies can't hold profits in bitcoin"... the threw that one in there because they plan on giving it up.  Just watch.  That's their way of saying they 'compromised'.

It does go both ways.   Rates have to go lower though.
