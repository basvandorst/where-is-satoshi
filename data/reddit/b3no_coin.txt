In the end it means that Bitcoin is a fragile technology that can be broken by one decision a company makes.

Only an idiot would trade the future of global economics for past worthless tokens.

This is the only response I ever get. "I'm not going to explain you what this is, but it's somehow awesome."
Yeah, sure. Looks like the scam is going down.

You can list many countries to make it seem like it's somehow fairly distributed, but when you have 70%+ hashrate in China and the rest shares 30% you have a problem.
70% of all bitcoins produced are produced in China and sold on Chinese exchanges. This is a fact. It doesn't matter how much Chinese miners hate their government. And your claim that its fair because it's a start of a new economy doesn't make any sense.

I'm doing some trading on kraken.com (the liquidity is not so good but it's convinient for us from Europ) and they let you trade using leverage. Here is a video how it's done 
Basically you are trading 1.5-5x times the money you have in your account. You deposit euros and always have euros. When you open a position you see how much you profit/loos in the P/L column. Because you can open an order with 5x the amount you have you can gain/loos 5x the speed.
Here is an example:
You have in your account 100 EUR. You open a SELL order at the price of 300 EUR/BTC for 500 EUR (5x your account). Now the price moves down to 297 EUR/BTC or 1%. If you now close your order you will earn 5% or your account will hold 105 EUR. Notice how you never transfered euros to bitcoin. And the price was going down but you still made money.
Of course it's a bit more complicate. E.g. the price moves in the oposit dirrectino for 20% and now you lost 100% (5x) of your account and kraken will automatically close your order so they don't loos anything on their side.
Basically when you trade you are just predicting the price movement and your account always stays in the same currency. That's also why the price sometimes falls so fast. People are not stupid and selling low, they just think it's going more down opening SELL orders and making money.
