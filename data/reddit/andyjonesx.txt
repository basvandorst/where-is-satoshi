Bitcoin is more of a gateway to get the other tokens - which do something. That in itself is a utility. Until something else gets enough high volume pairings to take Bitcoin off the map - and assuming Bitcoin in that time doesn't improve to become viable for transactions, it should be fine.

Also it was called bitcoin because it was predicted that one will rarely use a whole coin.

Boom!! I've found it. It took me quite a while of looking and trying to work it out...
It's right in the middle. Look for the orange text in the middle of the white text. Not the orange text around the outside.

Its because bulls can't lie down and bears can't look up.

Only because you didn't understand it.

But what about if you're somebody partly doing it because you believe in the technology and ethics, and partly as an investment?
Let's not ignore the fact that many people are happy about going from very little money to bring incredibly rich.
Let's also not ignore the fact that banks and governments have many rules set up to make it hard for money to be used illegally. Money laundering costs a fairly expensive percentage, child pornography purchasing requires traversing bank account information, and terrorist groups have to lose a large amount of their money just to get it in a usable state.
There's good and bad, so we should respect the opinions of each other, and not expect everybody to hold one certain aspect in the highest regard.

In many ways I'm the same as you. If (or when...) it next has a big drop I'll still be holding, because I believe in it over time. But if there was no real utility for 10 years I'd do better putting the money in something that would draw interest and then buy more when it's ready.
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:52:03
Neither are you. I'm doing it because the value is raising. I believe in the technology, but if the value of my money stayed static I'd just buy it when it was being used mainstream. If that wasn't the case for many people you'd not see a very high market cap at all.

Only **as** true. I gave a comparison not a condition.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:17:15
Your statement is true of both exchanges and bank accounts, which is my point.
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:53:42
This is only as true as holding your money in any online account. The less regulation of crypto makes it a little more risky though.

Nobody should be FOMOing into bitcoin. It shouldn't be considered a trend. This isn't highschool. If people change their mind it should be due to increasing their knowledge.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:44:48
Go for it. I'm sure many people eager to pick it up will be hoping you do.
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:58:14
I think that attitude needs to go for crypto to ever realistically compete with fiat.

Playing devils advocates, but it is rich banking families that make this happen. Many people who inherit the wealth of their great grandparents. Is this not something made even worse by deflation? People/families who have money have more and more money each generation?
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:48:33
I've not heard that before - interesting! What is that based on, standard inheritance or does it also account for the super rich? What happens if it's land and assets? If you aren't sure of the specifics, I'd be interesting in hearing if someone else does.

We've paid a fair few people in Bitcoin in our business.
Edit: downvote? Apparently we haven't then ��
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:07:23
The amount of risk and potential reward is very different. People investing in Bitcoin are taking a very high risk high reward punt, and to some it can be difficult to stay in it when it seems to be on the way down... but that is when money is made.

Can't tell if that's the battery bar or just the rest of the graph.
