Sure... planes can practically fly themselves these days, so we don't need pilots, right?  Things go wrong like birds getting sucked into an engine.  A trained pilot is still needed in these cases to take over and steer the plane into the Hudson like Captain Sully did.  
The same will go for cabs and trucks.  Self driving cabs and trucks can steer those vehicles away from trouble, but it's not going to prevent someone from rear ending a cab or truck.  You want to be the customer in the driverless cab who has to deal with person who just rear ended you?

As a cab driver, I always prefer cash tip or if you paid credit, add the tip on the credit card.  
If I tell you that I am not familiar with Bitcoin and am not interested in finding out more, my hope is that you respect what I say and turn to cash/credit tipping.
I once had to set a guy straight who was trying to offer me tip in the form of a "rare" coin that was supposedly worth something up to $5.  I told him that as much as I appreciated that coin as a tip, that unike him, I'm not a coin collector.  He was putting the burden on me to do my research on the internet as to the legitimacy of that coin piece and then go find a coin dealer around town that would accept that coin and has knowledge of that coin.  Whether or not the coin was actually worth something, I would be putting in way too much time just to chase something that might be worth up to $5.  
So please, do us service industry folk a favor and stick with cash or credit tips.   If that service industry person does use bitcoin, ask them if they take that as tip first.  But DO NOT force it upon us to accept bitcoin just because you want to spread the word.
