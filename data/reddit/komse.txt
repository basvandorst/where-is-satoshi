I'd be interested in helping but I'm not well versed at all in codes. :(
I'd only be good for service related tasks.

Might want to fix your mobile site. 
It looks weird on my phone :(

Pornbit.com is actually a really catchy name

Isn't this a repost?

I understand that, but maybe because I'm new to finances and currency in general, the way people are purchasing them makes me relate them to stock more. ._.

Thanks! That helped a lot!

hi~ I'm new too.
From what I've gathered, at this point bitcoins as a currency are mature. Therefore, mining isn't effective any more unless you're running a cost effective mining rig. It has to do with the fact that block difficulty is high and a single person could take over a month (year?) just to get one block. 1 block is composed of 25 bitcoins also.
If you want to mine aways (I do it as a hobby on my 2009 MBP) try bitminter and their pool. It's a javabase application. c:

I bought .12
It's my first purchase, and I'm excited to see how this turns out.
Since I've never done investments/type, I want to start small. :)

I was just curious. Because I remember reading it but I wasn't sure if you wrote the first one too or not

Bitcoins are hardly easily accessible for younger people and teens. :/

That people like to gamble beyond their means.

I can't answer the butterfly labs question, but you probably shouldn't get too seriously about mining because mining is slow now.

Don't give up. :)
does profile critiques too if you ever feel like starting from a clean slate. I met my current boyfriend on there. ^^
