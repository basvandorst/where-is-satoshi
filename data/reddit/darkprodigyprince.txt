Just did up above but he’s saying he didn’t receive it and it’s not his wallet 
So idk if he trying to scam or

Yeah thanks for all the help but apparently his wallet was the blockchain wallet
Just another reason on why their shouldn’t be any problems seeing the btc in his wallet

No platforms or anything , I used the block stream green wallet app and he used Electrum bitcoin wallet

Also is discord secured for not it getting modified when transmitted btw ?

Couldn’t be the address altered since it’s exactly how he sent me it but who knows, what is the clipjack virus btw?
Openbazaar store with escrow ?
A regular simple purchase but on telegram he sent bitcoin address and I sent bitcoin to that address

Yah he probably did scam...
@_date: 2019-07-03 05:47:46
Yeah tnx for the answers , idk how I’m going to get my money back
@_date: 2019-07-03 05:21:22
Sent him the txid before that’s when he says it’s not his “wallet” lol
Yes same address in transaction but it took hours to deliver so his bitcoin address changed/updated but that doesn’t matter right since it still goes to the same wallet?

Yes the address was 14rgt17sp77Cz3pP1YDDiXDa6vGGmDbej1 And was 6 confirmations to be complete.
He says it’s no problem with his wallet , looks like he’s just scamming. 
So would it be better if I just talk to the wallet customer support about getting my money back if possible ? I used the Blockstream green wallet app btw
