You make a good point. Even if I had read that line, at the time I probably wouldn't have realized its implications, but you're right -- it looks like they covered themselves legally.

Let me add one thing: I'm not claiming to be sure that Coinbase is deliberately defrauding people. It could be that their choice of which transactions to reject really is based on their program's (imperfect) assessment of the transaction risk, as they claim, rather than on the Bitcoin price movement. If someone happens to have carried out a large number of Coinbase transactions, many of which were cancelled, then it might be possible to do a statistical analysis to see if there is significant evidence for a relationship between the Bitcoin price movement and the risk of cancellation. But of course, from my perspective, having only attempted one Coinbase transaction, it is impossible to tell.
Either way though, if they are going to reserve the right to cancel a transaction at the whim of a secret algorithm, then they should say so up front, and they certainly shouldn't withdraw the funds from my bank account and then change their mind.
Yes, this was frustrating enough that it motivated to me to make a Reddit account so I could tell people about this. It's true that I'm an "unestablished user", so I can understand if you don't believe me. I accept that Coinbase has worked well for many people. In fact, a friend recommended it to me; that's why I tried it.

So it turns out Coinbase decided to have a second reviewer look at my case, and they made things right by whitelisting me and completing my transaction at the original price. (See the update at the end of the post above.)
