What are people in Greece going to use Bitcoin ATMs for? The bank holidays mean all their savings are stuck in the bank unless they converted them already. Any one left getting Euros out of the bank probably needs to actually spend them on essentials.
I would love to see you do this. Where would you plan to put them?

Thanks. Unfortunately I think it also needs OPs fanfic for context, and I wouldn't want to besmirch such a gentleman's good name by copying his post to Edit: spelling.
@_date: 2014-12-20 21:16:05
The principal's tale was far better in my opinion. It had far more dramatic interest, and nice surprising plot twist at the end. This one needs a little more excitement. I'd suggest OP throw in some sort of government employee as an evil villain to spice it up. (S)he should have a look at some of the older tales on for inspiration.

I'll start with some thoughts.
Firstly, common sense tells you not to invest in a company you work for. You don't want a company going bankrupt to lose you both your job and life savings. However, Bitcoin is not a single company and cannot go bankrupt.
Secondly, it's unclear whether investing in the area you work in is a good idea. On the one hand you should have a greater ability to judge the success of companies. On the other hand whole sectors can crash in tandem: see the oil or mining sectors. However, Bitcoin is not really a sector of the economy. 
How wary should I be of holding Bitcoin while working in the Bitcoin sector? Should I just use Bitcoin whenever I can, and keep my Bitcoin holdings small, rather than hold Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-26 12:28:39
I'm afraid I can't identify Satoshi, I only saw him for a second. However, our 'geese' have yet to start laying...
@_date: 2014-12-26 22:03:06
I didn't say anything of the sort in that comment. I explicitly said that some people had made a lot of money via Bitcoin. I was refuting the previous commenter's point via sarcasm. 
Also, you've had to hunt through pages of positive posts about Bitcoin to find one which can be vaguely interpreted as negative. I think that seriously misrepresents my normal posting. 
I no longer wish to be allowed into @_date: 2014-12-22 16:03:18
I have a very close friend who works for NASA in Canada. I have been talking to him about the merits of Bitcoin continuously for the entire year. 
We'd be walking to the shops; I'd be talking about how widely accepted Bitcoin is. We'd be at the cinema; I'd be loudly telling him that you get a popcorn discount with Bitcoin and flinging my popcorn everywhere. We'd be at a funeral; I'd be happily explaining the advantages of concealing all your money in obscure places on the internet. Hell, we'd be side by side in the pisser, and I'd crack a nice gag about how inflation is pissing the value of his dollars away. We'd have a jolly time.
Anyhow, I've been advising him that Bitcoin is going to the moon. As a rocket scientist he seemed uncertain about this, but I said "Look at the fundamentals, isn't Bitcoin looking better and better? Surely it's low earth orbit just gives it the momentum it needs. I've been on Kerbal learning this stuff." 
He finally broke his non-disclosure and told me that NASA secretly loves bitcoin. All their currency scientists say alien civilisations will surely love to trade in a currency entirely held by humanity, and mainly by a small handfull of internet jokers. It's perfect for new adopters. 
Together, the combined might of mine and NASAs viewpoints swayed him, and he has set up a one on one meeting with a Mr NotDrugDealer via localbitcoins to exchange his wifes savings into Bitcoin. He's planning to send a few tips up for the aliens. Maybe 10 cents, maybe less. Anyhow, that's bound to make a good impression at first contact. (Thats's assuming the existence of  aliens isn't already being covered up by the Government)
Tldr: my friend finally caved and now Bitcoin is actually going to the moon.
Bitcoin is starting to look good also here in Canada/various alien worlds :)

Buying your first dollar in Bitcoin? Surely that's the wrong way round. Kids these days.

I think I've mainly said nice things about Bitcoin? Where the hell is the quote "hurr, bitcoiners are all poor" from? I don't think I've ever said anything like that. I guess sarcasm doesn't come across well on the internet.
Also, at this point and are practically conjoined twins: everyone interested in bitcoin posts on both.

Then, one of the other ladies instantly replied "Woah, what happened here". Luckily, I happened to be passing by with Andreas Antonopoulos, and we stepped in to give our standard routine explaining the wonders of a lawless world, the horrors of civilised society, and how holding just $5 worth of decentralized digital currency could bring balance to the force. 
Everyone agreed that a community effort to support the most vulnerable members of society went against their strongest beliefs, that rapacious self-interest was the only virtue of humanity, and that  those who owned no Bitcoin should have to sit at the back of the bus. We then started a small orgy: all printing off our paper wallets and circle-jerking all over them to they were reduced to a pulpy mess.
As we lay in this exhausted mess a respected economist walked in and suggested that owning $5 worth of pulped up paper Bitcoin and annoying people with our crappy shilling was not adding value to the economy in any way, shape, or form. He suggested we stopped circle-jerking and attempted to build some kind of business to add value to the community. We all spat in his face, and told him his obvious trolling could not break us.
Next, a noted mathematician happened upon us in our stupor. Curious, he inquired on nature of Bitcoin. Happily, we restarted our well-rehearsed shrilling routine. However, when he asked why Bitcoin appeared to be based on a bizarrely chosen elliptic curve and suggested a more generic one should be chosen we realised him for the government shrill he was. Again we spat in his face and held open to door for him to leave.
Finally, a masked and unidentifiable person of no particular merit entered. They told us that Bitcoin would change the world, and they suggested we invested all our no-charge-back currency with them for a 7% a week return. Recognising a true captain of industry we did so. 
Now, we wait. We know that soon we few, we merry band of brothers, will be among the richest in a perfect world of Bitcoin.
Edit: Typos (lots, sorry)

Also, Bitcoin is less unwieldy in a zero gravity environment. That makes it nice and future proof.

I should let you know that I once met Satoshi. I don't think he's coming back... (I think I've mentioned  this before)
When the world was young, and the sun still smiled with joy upon the unblemished earth, I was but a little boy with barely a wisp  of hair clinging to my neck. I lived in a small farm with my mother and sister, and we survived only by the skin of our teeth. 
Unfortunately, we lived in a libertarian paradise, and my mother had to pawn herself into sexual slavery to feed us. Me and my sister were left alone as the grasp of winter began to draw close around us, with only an old cow entrusted to me for our future. My sister fell ill, and I could find no way to ease her pain. I knew there was but one choice: I must take our old cow into town and trade her for the medicine we so desperately needed. 
As I pulled on my ragged coat and prepared to leave there came a slightly awkward knock at the door. Jehovah's Witnesses ? I thought. But no, to my unbridled joy it was bearded man selling magic beans. I knew these would solve all our problems, and I traded old Daisy for a handful of beans.
I returned to my dying sister. "Look, magic beans! Maybe you should also buy some while they're cheap. I hear their price is going over rainbow." I exclaimed/shilled euphorically. However, she would not take the opportunity I offered: "You've spent my medicine/college fund on magic beans you dumb fuck. That cow was left to both of us. Sell them and buy my half back now you proper cretin".
I would not waste my beanz on half a cow. I took my precious beans to the garden, dug a small hole in the wintry earth with my bare hands, and buried them for safety. They immediately sprang forth into exponential growth, forging above the rainbow to the great bubbly clouds above. My destiny was at hand as one of the new 1%, and I scaled the giant beanstalk.
Reaching the clouds, I frolicked with joy. In the distance I saw a marvellous castle built of white paper, and set out towards it. At the gates I met some talking butterflies, and they offered to sell me some geese that laid golden eggs. I examined them; they did appear to be held together by luck and tie wraps, but then again who can resist a goose that strangers promise can lay golden eggs? Without a second thought I stripped the clothes off my back and traded them for the goose.
Naked, euphoric, and clutching an ill looking rooster beneath my arm I entered the castle. I could hear a voice softly floating down the corridor. "My white paper outlines the creation of these magic beans. I see them being useful for so many things. They could build scaffolding for castles, such as this, or allow the easy lifting of any object. Indeed, I think people will improve on this design. Giant potatoes to solve world hunger. Hollowed out pumpkins to cross the seas. This is just the start. Think of the glorious possibilities."
At the apex of Satoshi's triumphant speech I burst in. Both my cocks swinging with  abandon. My manic eyes glowed all the colours of the rainbow with the thought of gold. My paunch resembled a giant bubble, and I held up the last of my Beans to the creator. "The Beanz. I hold them, I love them. They make me rich. I hodl them and they make me Billionaire. Satoshi you is gentlemen."
Viewing the glorious scene before him stopped Satoshi in his tracks. His skin turned pale. His eyes widened. He fell to his knees, and implored to the heavens: "The horror. THE HORROR".
Anyhow, he ran away and was never seen again. Me and the rest of the bitcoin foundation moved into the castle to assume Satoshi's vacated god-throne. We bought a lot of those geese, and they should should start laying any day now. Also, fuck my sister she was just a troll.
