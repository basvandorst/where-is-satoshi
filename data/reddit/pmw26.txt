While it wouldn't surprise me whatsoever that previous bad practices contributed to drop Cryptopia volume significantly; Imo, the exchange has been making strides to improve in recent months.
@_date: 2018-08-12 05:09:41
That's exactly what we DON'T need to do. Bitcoin needs to remain "The People's Currency"...become more usable and therefore attractive to no coiners and the un-banked.

Truth to date and continued success to King BTC; should be noted though that Rhett has a great deal of shared responsibility in some of those failures; and also that the Anon Fork presents an opportunity to succeed where he failed.

I'm curious what the overall environmental footprint of the current banking system is....must be truly unfathomable; when consider all the paper statements, receipts, documentation beyond even just the energy consumption.

Haha I see it.
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:26:50
OP is 100% correct. Bitcoin is potentially superior to fiat in a variety of ways....but now transitioning it to a more convenient alternative to fiat is how we must pave the way to mass adoption.

Please dm me the contact info for your provider if possible. Been looking to upgrade to one of these bad boys at my place of business. Not available with current provider stuck with an ancient ATM atm.....

I get it; just disagree. Unfortunately most people would never be able to purchase a full Bitcoin at current price now; but fortunately they are perfectly suited for dividing. Most of the massive inequality in wealth shown by the charts you reference was precipitated by fiat's loss of value after no longer being backed by prescious metals. Bitcoin combats this. There always has been and always will be inequality of wealth however Bitcoin provides an opportunity to level the playing field and at the least provide greater purchasing power than fiat long term for your common folks being bled broke by the devaluation of fiat. Ultra high income investors are and will continue perhaps even more so; to come to Bitcoin naturally, they need not be targeted or due to Btc's scarcity, an even greater divide in the inequality of wealth could be created. While this would redistribute wealth to a small number of early adopters if price sky rocketed due to ultra large investment; need to look at the big picture of what BTC is supposed to really be about.

Correct; the tail currently wags the dog regarding the price of gold. However, the true supply of gold is unknowable making that more easily manipulated in that respect vs. the fixed number of Bitcoins. Hopefully that will save Bitcoin from the same fate in face of fractional reserve and other manipulations it will face from mainstream financial institutions.

Correct if you only use the card as a "transactor" you don't have interest. But less people are paying off their balance monthly. Revolving credit card debt is at ATH.

Bitcoin will never hit zero in the foreseeable future. There is far to much intrinsic value to the technological innovation; and too many true believers with a vested interest. The future is bright as the technology continues to improve; price and adoption will eventually follow. Even if it were surpassed in terms of mass adoption by another crypto its likely it will remain the equivalent of digital gold. Only in a post digital world, where everyone had far greater survival concerns, will Bitcoin be worth zero again.

Curious what the overall energy footprint of the entire banking industry is...
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:20:08
I didn't say anything about calculating the intrinsic value of Bitcoin nor that there is even a correlation between that and its market value. My opinion is that in the foreseeable future, assuming that the world remains digital, it will not hit zero. I think the technology (blockchain) has great value as do many other individuals and major corporations. Most of those whining about price or speculating it will drop to zero bought ATH thinking they would get rich overnight. If you think its worth zero I'll buy every coin you want to sell for $1 each which should provide you with a great deal based on your perspective.

Bitcoin was clearly not ready for primetime last winter (speed, transaction costs); nor were the masses ready for the concept of Bitcoin...but that doesn't mean that won't change.

Never good to give financial advice especially to family/friends about ANY investment or asset class...
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:24:28
There is alot to unpack here but I will try to be brief...I am not going to speculate how the world will be in 25 years except to say it is likely to be very different than today and that IMO that Bitcoin has a real chance of being used as a store of value there. Possibly as a One World Currency; but more likely as a Global Reserve, a digital gold, or some combination of attributes alongside other major cryptos both independent of &amp; some probably under political control. Nobody knows for sure.
I agree with you in that of course the political and economic leaders who benefit from the existing system are not supportive of the rise of a permissionless currency although I disagree with you in that their reaction to that need be repressive. I think more prudent, likely, and effective on their end to manipulate it to their own ends.
You did bring up some other very interesting points...1. Fdr confiscation of gold likened to fiat exchange to a Federal Crypto is a big leap though. I don't see that as a valid comparison given the historical contexts and the assets being compared. 2. Crypto coins as a novelty/collector item. I think you are really onto something with that &amp; in fact if Bitcoin fails as becoming a useful currency or digital gold....Imo it will likely retain great value one day if for no other reason as a collectible being the first block chain asset.

Agree that most have heard the term Bitcoin in passing after 2017; however the VAST majority of average people are unaware of what it is and how to obtain/store/use it. If these processes can be simplified and the world remains digital; Bitcoin is destined to suceed.
@_date: 2018-11-22 03:23:48
100% correct. Everyone here way overestimates Crypto awareness amongst the masses beyond most having heard the term Bitcoin in passing...
@_date: 2018-11-24 11:55:36
Subjective Theory of Value. I am bullish right now on gold, silver, and platinum as well. However, in an increasingly digital, decentralized, and geographically inter-connected world; Bitcoin will succeed.
@_date: 2018-11-22 12:04:03
Agreed that about a year ago Bitcoin price talk was everywhere; however I don't believe that equates to the masses understanding what it is or it's concept, pros/cons, even how to obtain/store/use it. It's difficult here to see it through that lense because everyone here has higher levels of awareness about it; but most common people are unaware of it beyond maybe recognizing that the term Bitcoin is some type of internet money or something that exists now.

While it's redundant and there are many more intellectual matters which could be discussed; it is encouraging to see growing adoption whether it is one new ATM in a mall in Minnesota or Bitcoin being accepted at a coffee shop in Vienna....while seemingly small and unrelated; when taken in unison these developments will have a greater impact over time. Great journeys are made of many small steps along the way.

A different world is not only possible, it is inevitable. Is it more likely that in an ever increasing digital and interconnected world that everything except for currency will evolve in that direction?

The FTC lists "Five Red Flags" which they deem are indicative of an MLM/Ponzi/Pyramid Scam. Bitcoin doesn't fit into any of their criteria. More people having confidence in and having a use case for Bitcoin is necessary to increase its value that is true; but that is also true of paper money, real estate, and even precious metals; and is not indicative of a scam in itself. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 23:38:08
I think the point is that with greater awareness, confidence, and adoption that subsequently demand and value will increase greatly. This is not only true of Bitcoin, but most asset classes in general.
@_date: 2018-12-18 00:28:57
You hit the nail on the head. Do most users understand the internet, smart phones, tv, etc? I think OPs point is true in the sense that people need to stop having the expectation of Bitcoin being a vehicle on a fast track to wealth; but as great of a concept that Bitcoin is theoretically you cannot force people to learn about it or other technological innovations; in fact the less they need to learn about it &amp; more simplified it becomes, is when mass adoption can occur.
