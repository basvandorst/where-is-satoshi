There's no free money, for every person that sold at 19K, someone bought at 19k.
Someone's always left holding the bag.

He probably would have sold them by now anyways.

Which you will exchange how?
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:45:28
It's about futures trading not exchanges
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:18:25
haha, maybe I do, maybe I don't. Thanks for the gold!

What? People pay taxes to the government so it can keep them safe from a whole bunch of stuff including being scammed
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:11:13
Does it still work?

Having your currency tank makes it harder to vacation out of the country.

I think that's part of his point. You're almost always better off NOT spending any BTC.

That doesn't make them unreasonable,l. Collect taxes in USD. 
If we were talking about someone making income in another currency for example, that person would still need to convert their foreign currency to USD for tax purposes.

It was sarcasm and no they won't. They will seize and sell your things for USD and take that for reimbursement, but it will all be based on the USD worth of the things you have.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:53:46
Sure, in 5 years the US will change it's constitution to allow taxes being paid in something else that USD... lol

You do have big players though, it can be manipulated.

It's always beef in the end
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:55:06
That's the point, it's meant to incentivize not sitting on money. 
Circulation of money is what grows the economy
@_date: 2015-09-19 03:17:43
To be trurly honest, if the world's economy collapsed nobody would want neither gold or bitcoin. They have no real immediate use.

Which may be higher or lower than the current price
