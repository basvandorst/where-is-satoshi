I'm aware of the fact that it's a currency. I just don't want to buy Bitcoin because its value might fall. I want to support Bitcoin but I don't wanna put my money on the line.

Here's where I stand on it.
With the way Bitcoin's value is fluctuating right now, it's too risky to be bought as a currency because while it might increase in value, it might decrease in value too.
This makes it more of an investment than a currency. The thing is that if I wanted to invest my money I would probably use something other than Bitcoin to invest it in.

What's making the price drop is that there are a lot of bitcoins being offered. It's simple supply and demand. The reason why it's dropping is because a lot are being offered and a few are being bought.

That I like. Can you tell me more about the 3% at Gyft?

Hype dying down, not many people buying. Simple supply and demand. When there is a lot of demand people can and do sell at higher than the market price which eventually makes the price go up. When there isn't much demand people offer to sell at a lower price to get people to buy which makes the price go down. With fewer people rushing to buy bitcoins people have to sell lower which makes the price go down.

Will this be integrated with Apple Pay? In other words, will it generate a card that gets added to Passbook so that it pops up when I'm near an NFC terminal and so on? AFAIK, iOS doesn't support API access to NFC yet.

Lurker here. I want to start using Bitcoin, I really do. The problem is that its price varies a lot. It's good as an investment but not as a currency. I don't wanna convert money to Bitcoin only to have its price drop by half a month later (exaggerated). If I am to use it as a currency I don't care what the exchange rate is, I just want it to be relatively stable like most currencies.

Thanks! I'll look into that.

It's too volatile for me at the moment. buying at $600 hoping it would keep climbing woulda been a huge mistake for example. Even right now; it's still going down and we don't know what its "stable" price will be.

The problem is also solved if most of the mining is done on other planets.

The teacher either thinks that or she misunderstood "age appropriate" to mean something someone in 8th grade would write about as opposed to something socially acceptable for an 8th grade to write about.

Blockchain has an app in the App Store.

At the time it was rising steadily for months. I bought it with the intention to keep it for a long time but since then it fell below $600 and never went back up. It's rising slowly now so maybe sometime soon.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:15:59
That's just sad!

It doesn't? I thought they realized that only people who made so much money from bitcoin's boom would pay $100 per cookie and that is why they're targeting them.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:03:45
I'm seriously considering doing that.

I'm just waiting for Apple's stocks to rise back up to over $600 (the price I bought them) so I can sell them and buy bit coins with the money.

You go to a place that exchanges money and you convert the euro to dollars. It's way more complicated than that and definitely less known to people how to convert bitcoins to local currency.
