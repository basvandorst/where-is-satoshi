They almost stole 7 BTC from me few years ago. Took me over a year to receive their e-mail with the recovery information. Blockchain.info? Never again!
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:04:42
I was using it. Now I've moved to Copay...
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:03:53
Using Copay here. I liked it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:03:28
Not taking risks. I've already moved to Copay. Take care man... The real Bitcoin is the only one.
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:45:59
Obv not, now I'm using Copay. Breadwallet said they were going to Bitcoin Unlimited. SCREW THEM.

Almost lost my BTC to them. Tried to recover my wallet during a year in failure, never received the e-mail. After many tries the e-mail came and I took the BTC out of that shitt* wallet as soon as possible. Run away from Blockchain.info, that's all I can say.

I didn't receive it for over a year. I tried multiple times. One day, after trying ALOT, the e-mail received. Not even kidding, not sure if it was their mailing system or something, but I tried over 50 times over a year and nothing. And then boom, it appeared after I tried one more time. Never blockchain again.

People were saying bad stuff about Samourai few days ago. Now I'm scared on which wallet to trust...
@_date: 2018-11-11 21:39:39
Don't sell it, hold it bro.
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:44:21
Found them. Just have to check on what to or not to believe into... I'm skeptical on the moment about Samourai though.
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:05:17
I have more than 100 bucks in Bitcoins, so sorry if I take alot of care with MY belongings. Yea, I don't trust 100% of what they said, but I also don't trust Samourai's side 100% either anymore. Peace.

Any help is appreciated.

That their client-side is shady and they don't reveal some stuff even though it's all supposed to be open-source. People are saying to use Edge now instead...
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:50:25
That's actually very cool. Thanks for this!
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:50:05
I'm not. I'm just very very scared that someone might be able to steal my Bitcoins if I download some wrong APP or click on the wrong ad...

Green Address you mean the Wallet? I only use it. It's one of the best. You have FULL control over your coins. And it should have enough confirmations by tomorrow.

F..k Paypal. I know people who lost over 3000 dollars to them. Money that they made gaming. They simply locked the account and want a document-proof of where the money is coming from. So... money is gone, forever.

Someone translate plz.

I wasn't able to acess some Bitcoins that I had for 2 years thanks to Blockchain.info . Their e-mails with my wallet NEVER arrived, couldn't do anything. Miraculously after 2 years of trying it arrived one time. Moved it all to Mycelium. NEVER again Blockchain.info...
