I am stumped about the whole anonymity thing: I don't want to mine, I want to buy BTC already there. All the exchanges require me to sing up and provide proof of identity before agreeing to allow mne any transaction.
Where is the anonymity in that?

You have something here.

Really? There are a lot of studies pointing out how having a cell phone improves the livelihood of a whole village, and how the  cellphone acts as equalizer in arbitrage situations, as it is a good way to provide up to the minute information ion prices, amount of buyers etc., so a small farmer doesn't have to make the trip to the city market in order to sell if prices  are too low. Similarly, in countries where waiting for a line takes months and years,  the immediacy of the mobile gives them the ability to phone now, when needed; furthermore, since they can spend flexibly (all you can pay etc.) the users can choose when to actually sue the phone and measure their money and funds, whereas on the land line there is always a fixed amount monthly, use or not.

How much is the car worth? A smaller amount you can always put barter, and set the price very low so taxes are small. 
Barter does carry weight on larger transactions, and I don't think you can escape the sales price on this one (market has a definite value).

For us it is not a luxury,and falls pretty much in the category of basic services: utilities.
For people for which their livelihood depends on them, they are necessities.
Now, smartphone &lt;&gt; cellphone, but the line is very diffuse, and services increase and demand grows.

I like the idea of a currency that is limited in growth, as the whole inflationary currency gets value from growth be either on consumption or other activities that provide value.
However, it does bother me that there is no hard commodity backing it up - unless you count all these Tflops a commodity. Coffee, cacao, salt, oil have all been used to back up currencies, because their supply is limited and there was an exchange for these currencies.
With the abstract  bitcoin there is no such a thing - only a limit. And if technology fails, or another volcano erupts, the bitcoins in the wallets in that flow zone are gone.

Gold, unless BTC, can be conveniently stashed after a power failure, volcano eruption, explosion, flood or arson.
If a plane flies straight into a gold reserve, the gold will still be there after the fire cools down. What about BTC?

no, waxjar. What are luxurious changes depending on the user. If you avoid spending three days and all your available money on a worthless trip, this is a life saver. If you can suddenly know about better prices for your harvest, all of $500 dollars for two months work, it is worth it.
People have very different notions of what is luxurious or not, valuable or not. You, being on bitcoin, should be aware of that.

Do you know of anybody mining with those?

Cellphones are, actually, basic needs.
