Why would I do drugs? Bitcoin already ruined my life from the cancerous gamma rays. I used a lot of them to get to the edge where the sun doesn't shine for several years. The problem is I could not pay for them, because my credit card couldn't handle them. The problem with using Bitcoin though is that you can buy drugs from a friend on the Internet! You can easily send money to someone who could do something about it. Bitcoin is just so anonymous. If Bitcoin is banned, people like me will be able to send people on acid.

What kind of Christianity do you believe?

Cool, but pretty risky to ONLY accept crypto this early into adoption imo.

Where does the Bitcoin come from?

TL;DR: basically some bitcoin gave me radation posioning and a little bit of money because I started paying attention to social media and how we communicate and connect with each other to try and learn as much as possible about the space we're in.

Not the OP, but if you could answer this that'd be great. So it's my understanding that there are two kinds of wallets. One address ones and multiple address ones. I use Bitcoin Core and it has multiple addresses. What would happen if I were to recieve bitcoin with one of the addresses, then delete that address? Would the Bitcoin still be in the wallet? Also does the wallet itself have a private key, or just the addresses?
