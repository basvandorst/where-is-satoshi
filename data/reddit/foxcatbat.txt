Patent = paperwork, meaningless, useless.
All best tech comes from europe, for free - tcp/ip, skype, http, linux, bitcoin, irc, video codecs, mp3, etcetcetc cause in europe people are not desperately trying to get rich and make ridiculous shit, as ur survival is taken care of for free. And yes its free as taxes are optional if u have no income!

As person born in soviet union, where doctor made same money as toilet cleaner, i can say medical care was on average much higher compared to my experiences now in capitalist countries. And best medical treatment i recieved in senegal, africa of all places in voluntier medics without borders tent. 
While in florida i experienced doctor who just insist on prescribing certain pills, cause he is all bout dat money...
Dats just reality

internet was not "invented" by darpa. internet as most people use is protocols like http etc, whic were done by international science community.
what darpa did was just have a practical communications need, and so experimented in connecting computers, but it had just small effect on "invention of internet".
but its somehow human tendency to just point that this one thing was fucking crucial and super important when it never is

i had email in 1995, free from my internet provider. i never used it as i had internet not for email like everyone else.
do i get free bitcoins from ISP? nope. thus to claim that expansion of bitcoin is as easy as of email is bullshit.

well u can pay 10000$ for wine bottle, like some companies crazy paid for email if what u say is true... in general email for decades was a side thingy running for free on server dedicated to other stuff and given out freely to clients of server owner. if any company ever paid shitload of money for email, well they are insane...
here is how i imagine it happening:
"hey we should get on this email thing boss!"
"um, why?"
"cause its hip and cool and will save paper"
"ok i will pay millions to save some paper, thats my true passion, also we need be cool and have the newest thingy even noone else has and we will mostly use it internaly to send messages from office to office..."

80? if so then bitcoin started with first encryption? PC and internet cost dont count neither for email nor bitcoin as people will pay for it the same even email or bitcoin didnt exist.
what u talking about is setting shit up for companies not average users, who are bread and butter of everything.
i, as &gt;99% of all people with email, got it completely free as some stuff u can do on internet. point is u cant do same with bitcoin as it is precious, unlike an email account.
@_date: 2014-12-22 21:04:03
email was never expensive in human history, network infrastructure is not email for fucks sake, email is protocol running on top of network.
if someone built a network just for email they were retarded, get a fucking phone...
@_date: 2014-12-21 20:42:39
yes but u still can use email hardcore way as u can do with bitcoin, u still can use archlinux instead of windows, simplification does not change that you need get bitcoins - which are scarce and valuable, not like email, email with limited inbox size and attachment size can be run as bonus ultra cheap side thing on a server for some other thing, thus it is practically free, but now if i want bitcoin aint no body giving it to me for free.
p.s. i did get some from changetipers, but i mean in general average dude way :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:17:40
u speak like corrupt devil
there is no chance ever that i will touch bank services in my life!!!
what you say is like you should still buy post marks cause to send letters trough post, noone yet has email...
but i guess it is easy for me to talk cause i live in middle of mongolia and we feed ourselfs from our herd, i never buy food or clothing, we make it all for ourselfs, i hate cars and i love living in tent so only thing i need money for is high tech like my sattelite dish for internet and laptop, which i can BUY WITH BITCOIN!!! they even ship to mongolia!!! forgot the website, but it is easy find on google. and dont come with hospital bills nonsense, here we say if noone helps a person, than he is not worthy to keep alive.

u feel the truth n it hurts bro
@_date: 2014-12-21 20:35:40
point is email does not cost money for user, having bitcoin does, having address with 0 bitcoins is like having email but not be able to send emails.
because of that bitcoin cant spread like email did, it will take longer.
companies cant force people use email or bitcoin, they just can persuade, bitcoin is individual friendly money and individuals are major market, there is no point to use bitcoin in big company deals as law and banks serve them way better than they do with individuals.
your points are mute and wrong
