So you are a sociopath who gets off on people suffering? Fantastic, you must be a hoot at holiday parties. Perhaps you should also work the suicide hotlines.

Because of the bitcoins?

The Chinese are shrewd when it comes to currencies. They love to have as much holdings as possible -- the large problem with Bitcoins in China is that they are decentralized. The Government simply doesn't want a currency that it can't have some control over. That will not prevent the widespread use of bitcoins. If anything it will open up new types of exchanges, the first Government that fully adapts and embraces Bitcoins will win, and if I was in the Government I would fully back bitcoins.
If we backed it, it wouldn't matter if China told banks to stop using it, since it is decentralized the wallet holder could simply exchange the Bitcoins into a different form of currency and then back into the Yuan. Making money on fees in the meantime and building new business opportunities. China doesn't want it's people to crawl out from the oppression they put on them through there own currency. When a currency actually comes out and allows the poor to make a living and liberate themselves -- that is bad news. What happens if those people adopt Bitcoin as the official currency and start to refuse the Chinese issued currency.
