been happy with bitfloor. All of them are down right now though, so it doesn't matter. MtGox is going to dictate everyone for awhile.

No, put mine in an hour before shutdown, haven't seen my money yet.
I was worried about $500, but now I'm not after hearing you expecting $32k

I deposited $2k last night right at BoA COB. Didn't have anything in my bitfloor about an hour ago. Emailed LocalTill, got back to me in about 30 minutes and said they just processed my transaction. "Apologies for the Delay"
You might be correct in your assumption.

bitfloor. Just be prepared for delays.
They will want government ID when you wish to withdrawal.

That block isn't necessarily one person. It can be several people selling whole bitcoins at a whole dollar value.

I just bought reddit gold using bitcoin.

I don't believe it is illegal to put money in an account. It's not like you are stealing. Your presence acknowledges the fact that you are relinquishing money. So I don't think they would flag you.

Deposited some cash using BoA and Bitfloor yesterday at COB. Still waiting on my money to hit my account.
If I were anyone looking to deposit quickly, I'd search for another method right now. LocalTill is having some major problems. I'm upset that I paid ~$50 in processing fees, when I could have paid a flat $15 for a wire transfer. From what I've been reading, the delays with LocalTill could be a few days.

You have San Antonio, but not Dallas?

I am in the same boat as you, same amount and time frame. Still waiting on my money to get into bitfloor. Sent emails to both companies and haven't heard anything back.
This isn't looking good. I advise everyone to stay away from them until this gets resolved.
