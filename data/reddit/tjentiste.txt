This is EXACTLY what bitcoin users shuld be afraid of. This user above is prentending to be HODLer but in the background is a trader/manipulator. Making money on the price drops and shorting bitcoin.
In his own words (see user: Deloit profile):
“Should have SODL at 8 or 9x and bought back somewhere below that. HODL isn't a skillset. Trading is.”

Now the negative headlines (people loosing the life savings, borowing money to “invest”, etc) which further drives the price down and spookes any new investors, driving the price even further down. The vicious cycle continues....
Yet, many will hope that “this time is different” and that they cannot possible be wrong, when in fact all bubbles burst the same way. 
Now press that down button, yeah that will help...
It was fun watching this social/monetary experiment since 2010. GAME OVER.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:08:54
Of course it is
Total capitulation in price is almost here. 
The people who “HODL” will learn an important lesson in finance/economics and markets. 
All the signs are here but “groupthink” is an powerful phenomenon in human nature.
It is unfortunate as most of these are first time investors and will be devastated. But as anything in life, live and learn.

Hey Einstein,
That is not a meme but observation of market psychology during every bubble.
This bubble is no different than any other in history and is “becoming true”.
1. Negative headlines (people loosing their homes etc)
2. All the negative news drives the price below $10,000 which deters any new “investors”. No more greater fools can be found (market is saturated).
3. People who invested November onwards panicking (“I just want my money back. What was I thinking”). People who invested pre-November are getting out (“I havent profited  but did not loose either”)
4. Another major price drops as selling accelerates and no floor is found until $800-$1000
5. Tranders try to drive up the price again, post $1000 (just like post $10,000)
6. Price goes up to $1500-$2000 (some people see opportunity again)
7. Price steadly declines over a year period to sub $100.
8. A year later, bitcoin was something people did in 2017-2018. Lessons learned. New pump and dump is found and Bitcoin becomes history.
All the writing is in front of your eyes and you CHOOSE to lose.

1. Regulation and exedus. 
2. Price drop and many broken dreams

I went to casino and lost 50 percent.
I am not worried at all, just a “healthy pullback”

Imagine this
Pensions funds using bitcoin, govts using stabilizing mechanics (monetary and fiscal policy) using bitcoin, govts accepting bitcoin to settle your liabilities (taxes), world trade (stock markets) settle in bitcoins.
Beyond pipe dream!

Yes. 
“Toys-R-Us” is going bankrupt. Lot of Lambos left. 
Will (soon) cost you a whole “BitCon” though (about $10) but consider it a good deal.

I hope your comment/s can save a “investor” or two from a financial ruin. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:17:04
That is a normal coping mechanism.
The fact is, this “correction” (as you call it) is very different from any other. The general public was not involved (see background of the graph)
Mania is over. Panic is seeting in for a regular Joe. As a resullt, price is going in the path of least resistance. Down.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:26:01
I would not touch it at $0.01.
Do you want to hold nortel stock at 0.001?
I thought so.

Finally getting a lambo.
Not because bitcoin moon but the car went on sale and I can aford it. Very excited, few things to work out but it is a finally becoming a reality. If I wait any longer things may change with my financial situation and the dream may be gone.
I am afraid the sale at ToysRUs may end so I am jumping on this opportunity today. Wish me luck. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:51:31
Nop. I though it was overvalued even in 2010. 
Plus to “invest” at that time was not that simple as it is today. So I never bothered.
I followed it very closely as I am interested in Economics/Finance etc. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:46:46
This crash is different than any correction in the past for the following reasons:
1. Public saturation. Hype is over. Early adapters cashed out while encouraging newbies to “HODL” (oldest trick in the book)
2. BitCon failed as a currency, store of value and efficient transfer mechanism.
A good article to consider:
 
3. What drives any currency are the taxes. You need dollars, yen, euro or whatever to settle your liabilities.
The BitCon ponzi sceme is unraveling. The price is going in the direction of least resistance. Down. Down. Down. 
But as in any bubble (tulip, etc) there always will be “believers”. They will hold the bag of “bits” until the end. They will always find new reasons to blame someone  (banks, India, China, exchanges, wrong technical analysis, FUDsters, “the guy from youtube” etc), a normal coping mechanism. 
The “healthy dip” turns into “healthy correction” which turns into “temporary bear market”, which turns into “only a temporary crash” which turns into depresion and financial ruin. 
The game is over. You will recognize this today, tomorrow or in a year. The sooner the better.

Sure, but being a both Canadian AND U.S bank that doesn’t seem to concern you at all. Ignorance is bliss.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:05:09
It is not. There is no correction at all.
Actually there is no “debt”.
In accounting terms, it is double edge book keeping. Someones debt is some else’s asset.
Your personal loan from bank:
Your debt = Bank Asset
Government debt = Non-Government (public) Asset
 
Good luck explaing this simple fact to “crypto” crowd.

Well, if you look at the price of, say, Nortel stock today (in penny stock market), it is not zero. 
There is always some fool holding the bag thinking there is another greater fool than him that will buy the shares at 0.002.

$20 is a bit optimistic.
We live in a capitalist society. External forces are to great for it to function normally and survive. 
It is perhaps ahead of its time (or could would have function in another era where socialist concepts were embraced)

This is the price you pay to “play” in unregulated markets. Sell the other few coins before it goes to the fair price of zero.

Yeah, it is not like they have been completely right during every bubble. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:23:38
Canadian banks banning CC purchases. You call it FUD, I call it reality on the ground. 
Even if you can dispute everything else, simple supply/demand economics will drive the price close to zero.
