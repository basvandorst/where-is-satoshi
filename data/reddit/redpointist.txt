The argument that people wont spend bitcoins because they think they'll go up in value is absurd. Why do people spend dollars instead of just investing all their money in the stock market? Because you don't KNOW if your investments are going to behave the way you think they will. If everyone already knew the ultimate future value of assets then they wouldn't fluctuate at all.

So your argument is that Bitcoin is useful to the powers that be because they will basically make using Bitcoin illegal so they can lock people up for using it? Hmmm....
So if my bitcoin wallet has a mixer built into it for privacy purposes, the government will put me in jail? Seems unlikely.
So you think the government will claim that everyone using bitcoin needs to register as a money transmitter, knowing that individuals wont do it, just so they can lock all those individuals in jail? Why don't they just lock me in jail right now and spare all the drama? That doesn't sound like what I heard during the Senate committee hearings, but whatever floats your boat...

I hear this argument often, but really how would Bitcoin be any more useful for a government surveilence system than the current banking system/credit cards? The government can already monitor all your bank transactions and credit card purchases with a verfiiable identity attached. So Bitcoin gives more privacy in that regard than traditional banking methods. For people who prefer the privacy of cash only transactions, use a coin mixer, or some other method of exchange.
