I know the owners of the law offices from when I lived there. Great folks! During tax season I said that people in Vegas might be asking about BTC so I explained it to them and when they started accepting, I put them on the site because it looks nice to have an attorney there. Vanity reasons.
I actually live in the D.C. Metro area nowadays. On the site it says Berryville and Winchester, VA (the Shenandoah Valley area). That's where I call home!

I'll take you up on that anytime!

Getting them to accept Bitcoin is how I get my foot in the door to provide them with marketing services. 
We JUST launched, and I have a couple of clients come organically, but neither of them have websites (yet, of course), so I'm waiting to give them to scoop on crypto currencies later.
Edit: I'm in an area where literally no one knows about Bitcoin, so having that knowledge and doing presentations really gets my foot in the door. Plus I love the idea of Bitcoin for small business, so it was a natural fit. I quit my old job and started this agency and immediately started getting interest. It's been a wild ride, but this is my dream :)

That sounds great. Like I said to u/yonkfu, I'm going to make all of my local Bitcoin promotional efforts available as they come along. The Bitcoin part of my business is philanthropic (if you can really call it that, what I mean is that it's free). 
Bitcoin sells itself once you can overcome the "technical" hurdles that block most people from having the desire to learn more. Bitcoin is a radically new idea, and what they perceive as a "technological boundary" is really a "logical boundary." It's a new idea, and it works totally different from anything we have now. I have never seen the software that connects an ATM to my bank, but I know (enough about) how it works. The ATM connects to a Database of Banks then uses my credentials stored in the magnetic strip to access the correct pathways and retrieve my money. That automatically updates my bank's database and in turn every other place that shows me how much cash I have in my account. THAT is what the boundary is for bitcoin.
I used to go with "internet cash," but now I make sure to save that until they have a strong foundation of how BTC works because it seems to them like I'm oversimplifying it. 
Send me a PM and I'll give you my personal email. Or I can create you a Google Drive folder. :)
Cheers and good luck!

Yeah, I feel like the fact that the whole world celebrated because 9 small businesses started accepting basically at the same time Overstock started accepting was a little bizarre. When Mr. Antonopoulos started talking about focusing on sending money to poor countries I knew that the responsibility for small merchants and the general public fell in the lap of... well... small merchants and the general public. 
edit: "the whole world" is admittedly over-dramatic.

I agree. I was looking at his comments about making Bitcoin all inclusive and it seemed like a task that is meant for a *long* time down the road. Focus on the building blocks, make the protocol secure, then focus on inclusiveness step by step... It's a process man, you can't just "do" it.

The only name a lot of folks know around here is Ross Ulbricht, and it's usually said, "Didn't the creator of Bitcoin get arrested for using it to sell drugs? Ross... something.."
Thanks, national media, for helping spread the innovative and world-changing idea of Bitcoin... oh wait...

Feel free to PM me with your email and I'll send you all that stuff right from my personal e-mail. I have 2 in-house graphic designers helping me to design the bitcoin promotional material for our local campaigns, and of course we have a powerpoint about "What is Bitcoin" for the same purpose.
In fact, you can feel free to use it wherever. I wasn't planning on guarding any of that material myself; it definitely should be made available to anyone wanting to promote Bitcoin.
As for what I provide the merchants for their business' own crypto-campaigns I'd be happy to give you that too! Wasn't sure exactly what material you were talking about though.

This idea has literally been floating around [for two years](

No bank or financial institution looks at any risk profile like this and says "NOPE THE WEBSITE SAYS SO". Any professional knows that these are merely indicators, which should be aggregated with your own data to create a full risk report. This data is worthless *on its own*, but when you combine it with other things it may be okay. 
Your comment is a bit disingenuous but it's rooted in reality.

Yeah that means as long as you are doing under a thousand dollars you just need a phone number.

Only one I've found is RunCPA, which is pretty nice.

I'm more looking for a master affiliate as opposed to a single brand. Is there something like that for Bitcoin?

Reddit doesn't like Press Releases, from my experience. It's a cool wallet though, definitely not for the 'bells and whistles' guys that are focused on touch screens and stuff - but for security nerds like me it looks legit. Maybe I'll do a self post with a review once I try one out!

Wasn't there a guy that was arrested for experimenting with radioactive stuff in a neighborhood to make a ray gun or something? I feel like I'm sensationalizing this a bit...

To be fair, Real Estate Brokers don't own the real estate they are selling, either. There is a difference between owning something and using your knowledge, experience, and company resources to enable the seller to sell their product by taking on the burden of marketing and infrastructure.  
**This makes sense for the sale of products and services, but none at all for the transaction of money.**
