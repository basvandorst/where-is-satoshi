Noob to this subreddit, not to Bitcoin. Therefore, I wouldn't be aware if this question has been asked before. If it had been asked before and someone found it annoying, they could simply link to the thread.

Same. I was thinking, "Man, I can't believe that you used to be able to just buy a 1,000 bitcoins for almost no money. Hey....wait a second."
@_date: 2014-01-02 02:55:15
I'm thinking of perhaps purchasing my target amount of bitcoins and then doing some trading on Kraken. Could that be a best of both worlds?
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:20:08
Absolutely nothing could go wrong. The price of Bitcoin always rises, never falls. Everyone knows that.

I took this in Buckhead, high $$$ area. That would be a good guess.

Thanks very much. That affirms most of what I was thinking. I don't want to get caught up in checking the price every day. I'd like to get in and ride the wave. 
A lot of my financial buddies think I'm nuts. I think it's a good buy. High risk, high reward.

That's good advice on not selling. You're right, I don't want to get into trading. That's not my goal. 
I think I may end up buying my target lump sum and then check prices monthly and make smaller purchases during dip periods. 
Thanks much! Very helpful to hear what others are doing.

This is somewhat fair. In terms of his sale of Broadcast.com, I agree. It was an incredbily poor decision by Yahoo to purchase his company. It was even even poorer decision to value it at what they did, especially given that they went into it with no plan of how to leverage it's value or use it to make money. He was in the right place at the right time.
I think he's a sharp guy but obviously very opinionated. I'm turned off by how he presents his opinion as fact, as if there is no possibility that he could be wrong. I think he's more tech savvy than a dinosaur, though I wouldn't believe everything he says either.

thank you, sir!

I've been thinking that anything under $1K is a good deal. Anything under $800 is definitely a good deal, IMO. 
From my research thus far it appears we're heading for:
* More funds
* More regulation
* And probably more exchanges
I see all of these as good signs.

Thanks very much, good point about the recent crash. Not choosing Option B would only be risky if another crash was anticipated to occur soon. Thanks again!

Very, very helpful reply. I love the idea of holding BTC and Fiat in equal balances and hedging. 
Sorry to hear about your losses in the last bubble. Thanks for paying it forward with your advice here. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 02:00:05
Very sound advice. I will seriously consider this option. Doesn't seem like much downside. Good points, all.
Best recommendation for an exchange to use for bidding on dips?

USA. I like the idea of keeping equal fiat and BTC balances.

Very good to know. I felt like I was missing out on something, so hearing this lets me know that I'm not. Thank you very much!

Mr. FuckFace, I have searched relentlessly. Thought I'd get a nice, quick and dirty reaction here, though, which is more valuable to me than what I've found via search. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:08:57
Hahaha! That's funny. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:08:33
Seems like you are in the majority with your advice. I appreciate it! 
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:06:14
Feel better now?
