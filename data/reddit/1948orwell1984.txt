anyone know the lighting node to regular bitcoin transaction fee ratio?
or have a current graph? i understand basically the lightning network does transactions in a "different area" and for cheaper, thus cheapening the transactions on the regular bitcoin network due to less volume.
**just curious to see the correlation between transaction price and # of lighting nodes**
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:29:26
he didn't call bitcoin trustless... 
he said it's not going to be bitcoin... and the coin that it will be will be "trusted"

ELI5 how it works?
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:11:54
well it does have value...
and if you think about it, it's value is astronomical in regards to the amount of people that use it....
we are at 14k with .047% users.... imagine what the price would be if we were at 5%. That's why million dollar evaluations aren't that far fetched

unless fees get to sub 1$... then bitcoin as a daily transaction coin is pointless
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:46:45
diversify bro...
bitcoin isn't the only good coin, far from it. 
It's a store of value, that's it
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:21:20
it's a lot easier to rob someone of fiat than it is crypto
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:25:20
Unless it drops to sub 1$ for everyone, than bitcoin as a daily spender will be pointless/never happen
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:42:32
damn that's too bad... :/
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:25:38
uhhh no it can't
it's a good coin, has it's uses, will be around "forever" i think, but it also has it's limitations, and in certain areas other coins are far better.
Take FUN for example, bitcoin is not going to be a catalyst in the online casino market. Plain and simple
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:39:46
why would bitcoin price drop if tether is found out to be fake?
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:41:33
What's that, like 20, 30 bucks?
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:12:46
didn't they auction them off though for like 100k?
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:38:50
the point of that?
that would have absolutely no impact on bitcoin gaining traction, because the # of people who aren't bank employees far outweighs those who are.
And how the fuck would they know if you did or not
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:59:15

Store of value boys.
that's what Bitcoin is right now and most likely forever will be.
Yes cost is going down and speed is getting better. But unless you can get fees down below a dollar, forget about it.
In fact it needs to go much lower and faster in order to be a daily spender

12USD a month vs 12USD a transaction.
be serious guys.
 and FYI i think if you have direct deposit(or something) then the fees are waved.

**"Wallets" equal people... kind of.**
For every wallet there is at least 1 person, but....
people can have more than 1 wallet, I have about 7 technically. I'd say the average is around 4.
Using 4 as the average number of wallets per bitcoin holder.
The percent of people that own any bitcoin would actually be (13,252,373 total wallets / by 4. then that number divided by 7 billion people on earth)=
 * **about .047% of people on earth own any bitcoin!**
1 bitcoin is worth about 14k USD. you can buy denominations as small as .00000001 Bitcoin

what it's worth if it takes over fiat is irrelevant.... what it can buy/get you is what matters.
A burger might not cost 5$ equivelant of BTC... it might cost 55$ worth of BTC, and it could be totally normal.
What im saying is the value of what BTC can get you... ie... the cost of goods will fundamentally change, at least that is my theory
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:04:26

@_date: 2017-12-07 23:16:17
you don't get what I'm saying...
i get what you are saying
if it takes over all fiat,etc(my theory)... unless you have a shit ton of bitcoin you(and most of us) are still going to be the regular schmucks that we are.
Right now 1 bitcoin can buy you a nice used certified car, 10 years 1 bitcoin might get you a fleet of nice cars. But lets say 5 years after bitcoin has definitively replaced fiat 1 bitcoin might only get you a laptop computer.
essentially bitcoin will still be valuable, valuable like never before, but what it can get you will be less than what is was before.
Unless you have a ass ton of BTC when that time comes, you will be  no better off. I think most of us dont have an ass ton of bitcoin, most probably don't have 1
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:02:00
wow you really backed up your statement....
the white paper doesnt mean shit....
it has deviated from satoshis original dream, it is still going to flourish but not quiet as satoshi dreamed. Another coin(s) will be the daily transactors.
why would i ever spend 5$ on a coffee with bitcoin when that 5$ a year later could be 10?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:16:59
yeah but when you are 85 and when bitcoin is over a million USD per coin you can tell your grandkids while sitting in your rocking chair that you were their age before bitcoin was even around, back when people used....

Like anything in life, diversification is smart. Even in cryptos.
take roulette as a loose example... you can bet it all on one number, if you hit it you are in great shape. but the chances of you hitting that number are very slim.
VS... playing a little bit of cash on multiple numbers, you increase your chances of success.
and as far as advice at a "toxic dump"(never been there)
but any advice in cryptos, is pure whimsical speculation. Sure some might have more standing than others advice, but it's all a crap shoot

Bitcoin will rise 5K within 36 hours of futures opening.
any news(for the most part) is good news. I don't agree that they will be able to maniupulate price as much as you think.

I had it well before i got into crypto.
I have over 60 sites saved, it saves my cryptos with 80+ charachter passwords...
how long is your coinbase password?
my master password which is incredibly easy to remember is over 30 characters.
not to mention you can turn on....
* 2FA
* make it for only trusted devices
* country specific etc...
it is far more secure than reusing the same passwords, haveing a bunch of weak passwords, and writing them all down on paper, especially if you have complex passwords you need to update every 90 days or so
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:37:35

okay... so they get it all... then they sell all their bitcoin, and prices drop...
then what? every schmuck(you and me) bought what they sold... now we have all the bitcoin, and we go about trading as usual... am i right? what would happen after they sell and price drops? Plus the majjority of bitcoins are already in circulation. 
i still don't see them being able to drive it down. I see the simple news of futures out weighing what they can drive down.

it's good to be skeptical
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:09:26
correct and a horrible one, since...
1... it is actually losing value(buying power/inflation)
2... it could all be lost in a fire
3... it is only as valuable as what people of other countries view our country as
you say "store of value" as if it's inherently a bad thing...
IRA is a store of value, a very good sound one. 
so is  a 401k
so is gold/silver
savings account
those are all stores of value that will hold their value AND  almost guarantee to make you money in the long term.
So bitcoin being a store of value is not a bad thing....
 if it can't keep(store) its value it will be worthless as a currency....
if it cant be used as a currency it still has a chance of being a store of value(ie, making you money)
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:29:54
I thought the segwit was bad, ELI5?
(am i confusing this with the recent fork?)
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:02:42

@_date: 2017-12-24 04:39:09

@_date: 2017-12-03 04:41:16
idk, why you would ever buy in bitcoin...
at least nowadays...
not only does it take 4 hours to confirm, what may be 2$ in bitcoin today may be 10$ a month from now etc...
not to mention there is a fee for any amount you send(unless you send from a free exchange... gdax)
for large amounts the fees would make sense
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:48:08
what i'm trying to say in regards to all these lambo, tesla, motorcycle posts is...
they are kinda stupid to cash in your crypto for, if you aren't making outrageous amounts of money. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:17:42
what be that?
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:59:35
Personally i see it as a store of value both now and long term
As of late, that's certainly how it's been acting. And i think long term it will be too.
I don't think the fees and times will every get low enough to make sense to use every day.... like buying coffee and gas etc... And 10$ of bitcoin today could be 20$ tomorrow
and i think it has a better chance of gaining more value as a store of value rather than a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:26:19
because what?
there is literally no fee to send to a wallet if you use GDAX(which is coinbase)

500k is penny change to billion dollar execs, or those who hold uber amounts of coin. And as for direct benefit, the increase people getting involved is the benefit!
They(big holders of bitcoin) could easily recoup their costs in a short time assuming bitcoin increases a small amount due to the commercial.
in any case it's exposure and good exposure.

well i have mine in 3 places, and 1 stamped.
but i was thinking a safety deposit box not for safety but in case something happens to me.
I don't trust giving someone part of it(in case they are shady or simply forget) 
and i don't want to write my pin/passphrase down along with my seed(for trezor). But i would feel comfortable doing that, in a safety deposit box. And if something happens(i die) whoever inherits my box, can easily recover my bitcoin/crypto

I don't think you need to tell them if you didn't sell... or trade(gray area)

unless you clear well over 10 million USD selling crypto, etc...
than buying a lambo is fucking stupid. A waste of money. It's realistic for us schmucks who got in/are getting in kinda late to reach half a mill or a million in crypto value, but...
if you spend that amount on a lambo or any other severely depreciating costly to maintain asset, than you are an idiot.
sry not sry
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:03:36
it's easier and more reliable.
Ie... you device can be completely destroyed but you can still recover with your seed.
I prefer the Trezor, you can make multiple wallets using a passphrase... so even if they get your seed they still can't access without the passphrase

there's 2 types of investors in bitcoin/crypto...
those that believe it will change the world and their ultimate goal is to see that happen...
and those that want to make a buck and cash in
I am in the latter, at the end of the day i don't care if bitcoin fails or doesnt change the world, so long as i make money while using it....
obviously i hope it actually succeeds, and i think it will, and I think it will really change how we use money, but not as a daily currency. It will be used **MAINLY** as a store of value, and it has been acting this way for some time now.

ROFL... i don't delete shit.
add to the evidence that I have murdered 3 people in my lifetime.
what a joke, i'm sure they could tie this account to me some way(cause you know the IRS is always looking at reddit accounts or even has access to your computers in normal audits, they have access to what you allow them to have access to.... unless you are so big and corporate that it's at the criminal subpoena level.   and in normal cases... granted if you don't give them what they need that could lead to issues, but this is not one of those things.)


actually i still won't and i won't legally...
I am required to pay 0% capital gains fee on longterm investments based on my income level. 
So again the jokes on you... your "evidence" is my obscure internet trail from reddit where i asked hypothetical questions about evading taxes, taxes that i legally wouldn't have to pay at this point in my life anyway


surely you jest. EVERYONE HAS CHEATED TAXES!
very few things in life are "always and never" but this is one of them.
Ever get a tip? did you report EVERY ONE OF THEM?
ever sell anything on ebay, craigslist, to a friend? did you report it?
gambling winnings?
did you, to the cent get all your deductible right or were you just ball parking?
ever make money under the table in your teen years?
Ever sell a little pot and not report the profit?
ever play a little garage poker? illegal you know
the fucking pot calling the kettle black.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:59:13


PREEEEEEEEEETY sure a major reason crypto currencies were made were to avoid government influence and reach. Merely partaking in bitcoin like you are no matter how legal you go about it only helps back that initial cause, which frankly is just as bad.
lol, and how can i not be smart enough to pull this off. Sure i might not be, but if i do x, y, z and they have no way to confirm that i sold it etc, then i would have pulled it off.
Besides the fact that I haven't tried it, nor do i necessarily plan to.
If no one was worried about taxes, you would never see questions about ID verification ETC.... No one should have issue with letting exchanges knowing their ID, except if you are trying to take tax advantages.
There is literally almost no downside to verifying your ID except the tax angle..... yet lots of people, not just myself are concerned about this

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:13
more than half of all bitcoins are already in circulation. 
also this, at least from the articles standpoint makes it sound good. 
It gets banks involved... in what appears to be a good way. ie... might be willing to accept it, interact with it.
That is how bitcoin will get big. 
It's not like you will have to store your bitcoin in the bank. But some people will want to. 
I think it's value will still rise immensely no matter what it's role ends up being in our world.
... there are 2 people who are in bitcoin....
those that want it to change the world and replace our current money system, and those that just want to make money off of it.
I am in the latter. I think it will be a role player(some form of crypto) but i don't think any decentralized crypto will ever take over fiat. 
It is just too risky for most to be entrusted as bank manager, teller, security guard, insurance, and police. You F up with crypto it's gone forever. Where's a bank is insured/will replace your funds even if it's your fault
believe it or not, crypto does have downsides and big banks do have upsides

this happened to me...

@_date: 2017-11-19 07:04:45
unrelated to your comment...
another reason it won't ever be the main player is it's fluctuation...
right now you go an buy something with bitcoin, they don't list the price in bitcoin. They list it in fiat. and you give the amount of bitcoin that equals that fiat price at the current market value(more or less)
if bitcoin were to take over it would have to stabliize it's price... AND i mean REALLY stabilize.
I think the dollar fluctuates 1-3% in value on a given day. 
(also it would be annoying to have to go about buying items and starting in the millionth of a whole number to buy a pack of gum. easy to miss see a place holder and give the wrong amount)

ahhh... but when that happens, will your bitcoin be as valuable compared to before it happened?
And somewhat new to bitcoin, but i don't see bitcoin or any cyrpto currency taking over like that....
I think this to be true for 1 big reason, it is too definite, too all or nothing.
What i mean is... if i send bitcoin to an address that is unowned I am fucked.
If i forget my 24 word seed, I am fucked
If it's stolen I'm fucked.
unless there comes some type of insurance/backing of some type the average person/layman is not going/want to handle that type of risk.
I see the upside of bitcoin and it's potential. But as the major player for the average person  I don't see happening. Mainstream banking has a lot of cons, but it also has it's failsafes.

the real question is...
if it does replace(take over) fiat money, will it still be as valuable?
eg... in the near future lets say .05 bitcoin can buy you a car. Years down the line if it takes over fiat what if .05 bitcoin only buys you laptop?
 
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:55:27
absolutely she could obtain those assets.
Do you plan to cash it all out or just use what you need?
In any case, spend it wisely. Sure buy some nice things, but seriously don't buy a fucking lambo. Buy a house, smart idea. Get a decent sized house, but don't get a mansion. A house holds and gains value. 
If you can, buy some land. Do you hunt? like the beach? Even if it's land in the middle of nowwhere, it will most likely only gain value.
If she quits her job, maybe she will go and do something she likes(go back to school) it's okay if she does... SO LONG as she is still making money, albeit doing something she likes.
If you don't want to tell her but want the cash, make up a  way of getting it. Say someone gave you a check from a random stranger (idk) or inheritance. 
but rest assured, if you don't have a prenup, that money is half hers if she splits on you.(have hitman lined up just in case ;)
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:59:46
it was just a rough example...

**Slight tangent/question...**
(**my hypothetical situation is based on how i understand bitcoin at this point.... feel free to let me know if my basics are wrong)**
If i understand bitcoin correct... it takes miners to do the transactions/people with computers. At this point you need super computers to really be able to do the transactions correct?
And it's only getting more and more complicated, thus you need bigger and bigger, and smarter computers. To the point that only a few, rich, massive corportations are going to be able to have the computers to process the transactions in the future
When this happens, what will happen(ie fees). I mean, what's the difference to big banks at that point? You will only have a handful of people with the power at the top... and this time they aren't regulated by a government.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:48:40

it's not a flaw...
idk how they structure it but...
ie... 32$ and 51$ will both be charged 1.99 . 52$ to 75$ will be charged 2.99
those are just loose examples but that's how it works. So it always makes sense to buy the highest amount in that fee range.
ie... if you want to buy 100$ worth might as well buy 115$ if the fee is the same

idk... while other coins may be the "silver to bitcoins gold" are you telling me you don't want silver?
i'm just getting started, but i plan to invest about 55:22:22 into bitcoin, entherium, and litcoin.
Late to the game, you could say, but if litcoin gets to 8k one day, I'll have a few and it will be awesome.
Also really looking into IOTA. A completely different foundation than bitcoin with really interesting capabilities. only .87 cents a coin.
Long story short on IOTA, in order for you to complete a transaction you have to verify 2 others. Essentially the more users it has the faster it will be. It has a few other major differences from  bitcoin as well.

I think your hardware wallets need to be updated...
I bought one by amazon. I think the company that it's sold buy is an official seller. **AND** it was "full filled by amazon" which means that the third party company never even touched it, it was shipped straight from manufacturer to amazon, then sold to me.

I think a lot of places will start to take it, but even in 40 years if it's strong it won't be the main player i don't think it ever will. Too difficult to learn for some. To absolute.... too easy to loose a code, a seed, send it to the wrong account, not FDIC insured. 
 Essentially you have to be your own banker. The manager, the security, the insurance, etc... that's a lot for some. 
And lets say it does eclipse fiat currency and fiat becomes all but useless, i feel like the day that happens your huge amount of bitcoin that's valuable, because less valuable.
kind of like a seesaw...  right now fiat is more valuable than bitcoin...
as bitcoin gains more and more value... fiat will loose value. Eventually fiat will loose value and will be less than bitcoin. At this moment is when your bitcoin will start to lose it's value.
Sure bitcoin as a whole will be valuable and will be gaining, but personal bitcoin holdings will not be as valuable compared before bitcoin was mainstream.
that's how i see it, hope i was somewhat clear in my theory

my comment isn't really in regards to hype or people corrupting it.
What i mean is, if the demand goes down... ie... everyone now has the supply. Then the value might go down.
And i don't mean it's literally value(8500K USD) i mean it's relative value. Bitcoins value is relative to fiat obviously, but its value is also relative to itself the people who own it.
If everyone owns it, it wont be as valuable for the people(you and me) who used to be the few that owned it.
(idk how clear i am in my theory)

i see it there...
it's not exactly user friendly. I still have to scroll through and add it all.
My IRA online shows on a graph a line of my current overall value, and below it(hopefully always will be) shows another line of the amount i have actually contributed

your title doesnt make any sense...


They do like it... that's why they only allow big money to buy it first.
If they didn't like it, they wouldn't let us buy it at all and wouldnt buy it themselves
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:38:57
you should sell now and then buy back at 28k
buy high sell low, bold move Cotton
(seriously... it took you 17,750$ in price gain to finally get you to come back in? you didn't think to pull the rebuy trigger at 4k, 6k, 8k, 9k, 11k etc? took till 18.5k????!)
