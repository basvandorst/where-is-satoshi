Merry Christmas to you to, Bruce

tbh, generally, I love my Trezor. This did scare the crap out of me, but a simple switch off/on again fixed it so Im letting it slide.
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:16:27
no probs. I dont use paypal tho, I'll wait for you guys to fix it... and look forward to James Hunts Bio
@_date: 2015-06-07 23:59:41
MyTrezor Lite gives your balance in USD. Instead of a four figure sum I saw a negative two figure total. Not sure how I misread that.
@_date: 2015-06-14 22:47:59
Im trying to pay now and Im having the same issue - no "pay now" button.
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:20:42
I think discussing errors here gives the smarter subscribers the opportunity to identify and fix open source software for the benefit of all of us.
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:04:49
yeah, that was exactly my thought. Damn, I wish Id got a screenshot tho

There's no reason we in the UK can't organise the same kind of event, right?
@_date: 2014-10-19 11:36:57
luv this guy!
@_date: 2014-10-02 01:09:08
i've bought btc there twice since they went public, including today (with UK credit card) No problems at all, the best, easiest way to buy btc i've encountered, by far
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:06:23
thanks. Ill pass it on
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:01:01
This. Except my payment went through within half an hour and my bitcoins were delivered seconds later.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:45:59
thanks very much. Ill pass it on
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:37:56
Ill pass it on. thanks
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:52:37
the first 1 was very generous, please let me refund you 12,340 bits @_date: 2014-11-07 16:11:29
Welcome to The World of Bitcoin, great tunes! 10 bits
@_date: 2014-10-22 14:37:23
It breaks down like this..
1.0= 1 bitcoin
0.001 = 1 millibit
0.000001 = 1 microbit (or 1 bit is becoming popular)
0.00000001 = 1 satoshi
@_date: 2014-10-02 01:20:46
You can earn interest on your bitcoin at bitvc.com in a yubibao account (its not much tho, about 0.01% daily)
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:53:35
@_date: 2014-10-25 15:42:54
still luv this guy!
@_date: 2014-11-12 15:16:29
Awesome! 100 bits @_date: 2014-10-24 15:39:11
I haven't read through all the comments, so apologies if i'm repeating info here but I suggest switching to Natwest. I don't buy from localbitcoins.com anymore but I used them a lot during the first half of this year. All my deposits were via my Natwest account with no problems at all. I've used my Natwest mastercard more recently to buy from Circle.com with no problems at all. Good luck!
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:10:45
It's been around for a few months but seems to be gaining momentum now.
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:40:23
....maybe, but it's the first time I've made it to zeroblock.coms headlines! I'm so happy
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:57:57
Oh, allow me to return it 4 mBTC
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:15:42
I struggled to find 1 of the screenshots they asked for but found it in the end. 
I love how they never hold your coins but send them straight to your own wallet.

I think this is the only bitcoin company with U.K. banking facilities right now.
@_date: 2015-05-07 11:33:20
very interesting read
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:31:55
thanks. Im forwarding all this. Looking for non bitcoiners trending on twitter
@_date: 2015-05-21 23:02:56
very cool stuff. thanks for replying.
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:25:15
using firefox I have to allow a redirect before I get to your site, and then only an option to broadcast, no option to view.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:02:31
:-) I love it! thanks
@_date: 2014-11-07 00:54:18
Great, thanks very much, Ill keep on spreading it
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:58:10
I reported this to Google 7 days ago!
@_date: 2015-05-23 23:33:27
I love your website, its a real shame I cant open it on my android tho. I only get an "SSL connection error"
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:56:27
try Safello. Once they have your info buys are very quick and the price is good.
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:04:30
nope, but tipup.me has just launched (still invite only) which lets you charge up your changetip wallet using credit/debit card
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:06:32
it may take you longer to get your first bitcoin, but it will be worth more!
@_date: 2015-01-25 16:02:45
Sorry to hear this, Safello was my favorite place to buy. I hope you're back soon guys.
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:40:51
fuck. ok, i'll have to wait for support. Thanks for checking, guys
@_date: 2015-05-02 10:29:25
yeah, my bad. I made an assumption. Ive googled a bit now and read a little more here. Good Luck! and thanks very much.
@_date: 2015-05-24 00:17:49
dolphin. I just got it working with firefox tho, your question gave me the clue. Thanks
@_date: 2016-03-08 12:10:45
funny! like lookin in a mirror, bro. You gotta love all those 6 foot blondes riding those bikes tho! 
@_date: 2015-05-02 08:34:51
Its a real breath of fresh air in this sub. People are being nice about an Alt! Amazing
@_date: 2016-06-08 06:41:04
Love this!....you should put your QR code on there somewhere too
@_date: 2016-02-20 23:30:14
@_date: 2016-02-23 07:25:28
Ive never heard of this outfit, but their product looks like the best hardware wallet Ive seen. Why has this thread been downvoted?
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:12:30
just wire transfer and SEPA, i think.
@_date: 2015-04-05 11:02:15
Its working normally for me.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:24:29
Ill check it out for you later....
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:48:18
Yeah, I got that impression but I imagined half the population here asking the same question as Ive been asked it before on the street exactly as you did :) I work next door to this station so Im around there a lot
@_date: 2017-05-17 22:50:15
ok, its the same 8% if you're selling bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:51:32
the price was around £1350 on UK exchanges at the time so, what's that? 8% ish
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:25:29
About half a million people walk past this machine every week
