I feel like Blockstream should be able to afford better Shills with 75M in funding.
The title of the whitepaper is a peer to peer digital cash system.  Lightning isn't peer to peer and BTC sure as he'll isn't digital cash when a transaction costs $25.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:02:53
Debunked how and where?  Happy to debate if you have an actual logical argument.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:17:17
Bitcoin Core does not have any more of a claim on the name Bitcoin than Bitcoin Cash does.  In fact Bitcoin Core has abandoned the original vision of Bitcoin (digital cash) in favor of a centralized store of value where everyone is stuck with their coins on exchanges.   Therefore it is core that should change their name to avoid confusion with what Satoshi described Bitcoin to be.
@_date: 2015-12-31 15:21:37
It only works through a centralized company.  Lightning requires two transactions minimum and you are presenting it as a magic bullet.
@_date: 2015-12-31 23:24:00
Yes, you can pick any centralized provider you want, but without an entity to merge transactions there is no benefit to using lightning whatsoever.
Bitcoin does not require an intermediary so it is completely different.
So please explain how I could send you a tip right now with less on-chain data than a traditional transaction using lightning.
@_date: 2015-06-30 02:58:46
Tx fees have been  growing over time as the tx rate has increased.  While it is possible (though unproven) that creating transaction scarcity will increase mining rewards, you are completely ignoring that when we hit the hard limit the whole protocol becomes unusable.
Additionally the status quo has been that blocks have had excess capacity, therefore the burden of proof is on you to show that hitting the limit will be beneficial.
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:47:49
And most miners now mine blocks equal to the max block size.  Are you implying that 1MB is a magic number that is optimal for miners?
@_date: 2015-06-30 03:02:21
And  when you decide blocks are full enough then we'll all just fall in line and do a hard fork?   The community has clearly spoken and you will be on the losing side of this vote.
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:30:40
Lightning only addresses a subset of the problem cases.  If I wanted to tip a user some bitcoin it does nothing.   You are being knowingly dishonest.
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:57:56
Yes, most traffic is on Huobi, however BTCchina just started some sort of voucher program that allows people to get money into their accounts again.
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:29:56
Let's say SegWit was activated.  Fast forward a few months when blocks are full again.  Now what?
@_date: 2017-02-08 05:18:08
OK, I'll bite.  What are these motives you allude to, and how do you know?  Or is this just yet more fearmongering?
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:44:33


That is a silly argument.   How exactly would someone censor bitcoin with large blocks in a way they could not with small blocks?   Do you really think being able to run your own full node gives you some kind of censorship control?   I would love to hear your explanation on this one.
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:44:46
Firstly, never claimed Bitcoin can solve all the worlds problems, but there is a large set of problems it can help solve.
It's only impossible if you insist on running a full node on your cell phone.  It's not impossible if you run your nodes in a data center like every other online service in the universe.
Delusional is thinking that sending and storing a few bytes should cost 5 dollars.
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:27:46
That is some elitist garbage right there.  For billions of people that is a days wage or more.  We have a moral imperative to scale so that people in countries like Venezuela can escape their oppressive governments.  This is a _far_ greater concern than centralization.
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:21:09
A fork by definition is when something splits.   It's in the dictionary.  Look it up...
@_date: 2017-02-07 16:38:33
That hat is terrible for Bitcoin.  Why would you think creating an association between Bitcoin and such a divisive personality was a good idea?
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:38:10
Your confusion lies in thinking the miners didn't have that power all along.   The only two players that matter are miners and holders.  Miners set the rules, holders can bail or buy in based on the performance of the miners.
If you believe the core devs have any real power, it is only because they have brainwashed this forum into believing so.
@_date: 2017-02-01 05:10:39
So anything less than 1Mb and miners are being wasteful, but we can't allow anything greater than 1Mb or the world will end.  Wow, 1Mb sure is a magic number! /s
@_date: 2016-01-13 05:42:45
Just hard forks?
@_date: 2015-05-29 00:04:14
I assume it's needed for the currency conversion.
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:12:20
We have the unfortunate circumstance that the current Core devs didn't build Bitcoin and don't really understand it.   Oh, they might understand the code, but they don't understand the economics, and they certainly don't understand the politics.   They are far from experts.
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:47:14
That is blatantly false and everyone can see it.  You wrote some code,  in a separate git repo.  It didn't get pulled into the main branch, there wasn't even a pull request.  What good does that do anyone?
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:53:07
And when/if it's banned, would you want to be running a node in your basement?   Think that through for a bit.
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:45:57
You need to explain why having bigger blocks leads to a loss of those properties.  Regardless of where your nodes run, the data will pass through a data center at some point.  All I ever see in your posts is a bunch of hand waving nonsense with no backing facts, evidence or data.
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:47:49
Core already said they could do it without Segwit.   Ping me when it's actually usable. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 13:04:55
So many have lost the point.   I got into Bitcoin so I could choose my currency.  I dont want to be forced to hold all usd, i want to make my own choice.   What good is money i can't spend or use?    Right now volatility is high because people aren't sure crypto isnt just a hyped fad.   If I can actually spend my money at stores the utility will let people know it isn't all hype.   Perception is reality.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:01:37
No, Segwit is not a simple capacity upgrade.  Core themselves have admitted it makes future increases more difficult due to the bloat of the witness data.
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:07:47
Why would we need lightning in a world where transaction fees are low?   Until we know how you plan to monitize Lightning we can't really know where your true intentions lie.
Between the persistent censorship, fearmongering over hard forks, broken promises of blocksize increases, and other toxic behavior we really have zero reason to trust you.
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:53:30
It wouldn't have been contentious if Core had backed it.   Criticizing the fork in that way is just advocating for central control of Bitcoin by a few developers with a financial incentive to cripple it.
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:40:23
So doubling/quadrupling the blocksize suddenly makes my node cost 1000x more?  We are rapidly heading for a world where a single transaction will cost more than running a node for a month.   I should be asking you if you can afford $1000 transactions.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:41:28
You must realize that position is logically inconsistent, right?  You agree the definition of Bitcoin is fluid, but you refuse to allow discussion about the possible evolution of the protocol?  This whole thing is going to go Streisand effect, but you seem oblivious to both logic and history.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:51:00
That's the beauty of a hard fork.   After the split you will own both coin types.  One will go up in value, the other will go down. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:18:00
Did you even read the paper you linked to?  Doubling the block size does not double the memory usage of a node.   Furthermore, the original white paper advocates for scaling in just this way.   Perhaps Satoshi didn't understand Bitcoin either?
Not to mention we have had 1Mb blocks for years now.   Surely you understand computers have gotten more powerful since then.
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:50:52
Believe me, I know how open source development works, and I know that his code wasn't even a good faith effort.  Where are the tests?  The whole thing was a farce.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:55:55
The contention in the miners is only mirroring the contention within the community as a whole. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:43:54
You don't get it.  The meeting was a trust building excercise.  Who would go into a situation like that and argue that they delivered it to themselves thus fulfilling the deal.  Have you ever ordered a pizza and had them say 'well we delivered the pizza to ourselves, thus the order is complete', that's insanity.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:29:36
Segwit wouldn't even fix malleability since you could still create non Segwit transactions.   It will take a hard fork to fix the issue which core has been blocking.
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:18:19
Yes, but will you allow it to scale in a way that doesn't benefit Blockstream?  Will you allow it to scale even if that makes your core product offering irrelevant?   That is the root of the problem.

@_date: 2016-06-30 14:04:12
And the price is going up which shows the holders are in alignment.   If the price crashed the miners would back down as it would not be in their best interests to proceed.
@_date: 2017-03-05 20:00:23
Luke's hard fork proposal was for 300kb blocks.   Not to mention the agreement with miners was for a shipping feature, not an proposal.
As for other toxic behavior, let's start with trying to imply that Bitcoin was merely hashcash with inflation control.  That is far from true and reads as you trying to take credit for Satoshi's work.
@_date: 2016-06-01 15:42:02
Nope, quite the opposite.   If inflation were at 1000%,  would that also be the yield?
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:52:21
Could not be happier right now.  Core has been serving the interests of Blockstream all along, and thanks to Theymos any dissenting viewpoints have been scrubbed.
Core - what did you think would happen when you threatened to change the PoW?   Basically threating to make millions of $ of mining hardware obsolete.
Like it or not Bitcoin has a system of checks and balances, it is not owned by Core.
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:38:43
Flat out wrong.  Just yesterday on the front page of there was an article about IBM getting 330TB on a tiny cartridge.  Given time, hardware will solve all the problems, Satoshi made exactly that point in the whitepaper.  When the whiepaper first came out I sure as hell couldn't buy a 4TB hard drive for $100 or stream 4K video, but I can now.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:36:07
Im a software developer, and I'm far from being swayed.   Segwit is bandwidth inefficient and Lightning has yet to be proven.   To put all your eggs in that basket is foolish.   Bitcoin is already confusing for people, have you even thought about the user experience of Lightning?   Jumping through all these hoops just so people can run full nodes on their raspberry pi is ridiculous.   Can you imagine if the developers behind the WWW protocols had such stupid design goals?  
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:39:21
So we bootstrapped a new type of money from thin air, but the assumption that hardware will continue to get faster and cheaper (as it has for the last 75 years) is too risky for you?
Maybe the pace of hardware improvement won't be quite as fast as we will have liked, but the market has already addressed that by scaling horizontally out to new types of digital currencies (Ethereum, Litecoin, etc....).   It may be that we have to have niche currencies for 20 years until hardware is fast enough to allow all transactions on a single blockchain.   It's not ideal, but that's the direction things are heading in (and it allows people the freedom to chose which coin they like best).
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:27:06
Funny, when discussing a blocksize increase people correctly point out that Segwit requires 2x the bandwidth (8mb for Segwit 2x), but when you ask people what the disadvantages of Segwit are, they say there aren't any....

Your cup of coffee is a days wages for the majority of the world's population.
As an engineer you should also be aware of the fact that storage and bandwidth is getting cheaper all the time.   It may seem counter-intuitive, but you could make a similar argument that people posting pictures of text (as in a 300Kb JPEG of some words) on Reddit is wasteful and stupid.   It doesn't matter, the costs of storage and transmission are so cheap, nobody cares.

From the comments....
Unit test and code for a bigger-block hard fork.
Parameters are:
  8MB cap
  ... doubling every two years (so 16MB in 2018)
  ... for twenty years
  ... earliest possible chain fork: 11 Jan 2016
  ... after miner supermajority
  ... and grace period once miner supermajority achieved
qa/rpc-tests/bigblocks.py mines a 50% upgraded -regtest chain,
generates 4MB of transactions, and then tests the upgrade and
mining code to make sure larger blocks are only created when
the fork conditions are met.
The activation state of the fork is stored in the block tree database;
it is written when the threshold is met (and unwritten if the
threshold block is re-orged out of the best chain), and read at startup.

Your logic makes no sense.  Blocks are small now and the agreement happened.
Furthermore, anyone can run a node.   It costs a few dollars a month.   It doesn't mean you have equal rights to decide the future of Bitcoin as does someone who built a successful business on Bitcoin.   Sorry, their commitment is far greater; therefore they have more say.  That's life....

That's because the crypto community scaled by converting to altcoins.   When Bitcoin fees got too high, people voted with their feet.    No reason for them to immediately come back (now that fees are low), they already overcame the friction of buying altcoins, setting up new wallets, etc....

I don't recall asking to be told what to do by a corporation, in fact I was advocating for financial freedom.   Funny how often Maximalists point others at BCH while insulting it at the same time.   Well, I guess if you want to actually make transactions and not just HODL, then I guess you can use that shitcoin!

You might try actually reading the whitepaper before pointing people to it.  The title is "Bitcoin: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system".  BTC is now neither peer-to-peer nor cash yet you mock currencies which are.

Metcalfe's law.  The value of a network increases with the number of participants.  For example, Facebook is dominant because it's a better experience for everyone to be on the same network, than to have 20 different social networks.   Similarly it's more convenient for everyone to use the same currency, and Bitcoin is already heavily entrenched ( as far as digital currencies go ).
@_date: 2013-05-01 15:27:43
Not sure if serious, but you know Bitcoin went from the mid 30's to around 2.50 a while ago, right?  A 90% loss in value and then it went on to go up 100x within a couple years.   I don't see how a 50% loss is the end of Bitcoin.
