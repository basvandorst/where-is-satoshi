A bull market can only occur if big firms buy up the coins.

If you can’t do it with stocks why should crypto get a free ride

Fuck blockchain and crypto. Tether pumped this shit to gain attraction and bring people in then it cashed out on them. They will keep doing this pump and dump for several cycles. Next bull run I’m out of crypto for good. This is the biggest scam in human history

$1k is bottom buy it then.

Scam project operated by tether to steal your money. Only a few prosper from this casino and come out at the top

It’s a bubble. Trying to take people’s money 
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:28:36
See you at $1k well planned dump from tether
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:10:40
Fuck you for trying to get people to buy a tech that’s worth $100
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:14:55
