I wish this post was beautiful satire and not the ironic disaster of genuine reply I assume it actually is. Review your post and let me know why you think it's a valid, constructive reply to the OP. 
If you don't think the post adds to the subreddit, down vote it and move on. You don't need to stomp your feet and cry from a ban because you feel it wronged you somehow. Both r/btc and r/Bitcoin have been ruined by the exact same type of users crying about the same inane bullshit. I'm so tired of reading about shills, FUD, and censorship. Those things aren't ruining the Reddit Bitcoin community, users like you are.

Exactly this. Just because something goes against your viewpoint doesn't make it FUD. You should emotionally prepare yourself for a crash. If it happens, you expected it. If not, even better. His "FUD" post ends with this sentiment "In the long run we'll all be okay and very glad we were buying so early." How can you even remotely describe that as spreading irrational arguments? I think a lot of people in this sub need to get their expectations in check.

I've found there's plenty of beneficial info and bullshit in both r/btc and r/Bitcoin. A lot of the time it seems to come down to petty blind arguing about loyally backing a brand like Coke vs. Pepsi, or Xbox vs. PlayStation instead of people researching what they feel is best for the future of Bitcoin.

Yeah there's definitely an issue. I can't even log in with my account currently (although I was logged in yesterday without issue) and the forgot password notification seems unresponsive.

The maple syrup flows endlessly and we're draped in the most lavish moose furs.
