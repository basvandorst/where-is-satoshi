I really wish journalists put half this much effort into reporting on the Wall St. criminal bankster's real identities and what they are like as people. Oh wait, that is an invasion of privacy, too.

I would be completely surprised and shocked if they don't. Version control is software dev 101. I don't know one single professional developer who doesn't use version control, even for tiny lil personal projects. It's the kind of thing that isn't usually mentioned in security audit, because it's not technically about "security" but rather knowing what the heck your doing in terms of software dev.

Thanks so much :) we actually only raised 56 BTC, but accidentally moved about 14 to / from a wallet and doubled it :P

Right. I've been a consultant and been paid that. Open source projects and CoinPunk in specific are NOT sub contracting to consulting firms.

I experience the same nonsense transferring money between my own US &amp; foreign business accounts, I couldn't agree more!
@_date: 2014-03-14 10:33:04
Difference is there are only 100 cents to $1 US dollar, not 1000 or 10000. As BTC's value in relation to the dollar continues to rise, makes this much more of an issue for common folks using it as a transactional currency. The fat cats who own hundreds or thousands of BTC and see it primarily as an investment asset, this is less of an issue.

Howdi all, I'm the UX designer of Mailpile, an encrypted email FOSS project  I'm also a huge Bitcoin fan. I'm not looking for full time work as I'm pretty busy with Mailpile, but I'd happily be up for some UX consulting on Bitcoin related projects 
@_date: 2014-08-25 10:42:55
Yah, I dunno why BitPremiere uses euros instead of USD, might be because my IP is in Europe?
@_date: 2014-05-03 13:37:45
Seriously!!! I see community growth aspect of spreading free BTC into hands of people who might use / build things with it interesting- I brought up this BTC Airdrop idea a month ago   and all I generated was 10 upvotes
Clearly the giving free money to usually rich Ivy League kids is more easy to understand / believe in by this community... isn't that somewhat contradictory to the goals of decentralizing power &amp; wealth?
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:55:33
Yah, what wood144 is correct. I wish we could actually "double" BTC, but then again, that would make it not really valuable, like the USD :P
@_date: 2014-03-14 10:35:29
Right, so if we make this change to the wallets then the media will have to learn a bit more about how BTC actually works and they can help explain this aspect to the masses. I know the media is incredibly dense, but I think the "Dollars / Cents" and "Bitcoin / Micro BTC" is something they can manage, but then again who knows...
@_date: 2014-04-12 18:06:51
That's an interesting aspect. I hadn't considered that. Maybe let a user choose which method? I would much rather pay a flat $20
@_date: 2014-06-21 14:43:52
Respectfully disagree. It is not futile, and it is completely unhelpful to take that stance. These are good resources about the issue  and  that came about after the research of Charles Moore (in the VICE series).

All for this idea. The CEO is pretty gutsy apparently

Ok. I'm not a user of either service, was just aware of the press. That's good those options exist. They are also large centralized private companies. A healthy web eco system needs both the former as well as decentralized self hosted solutions!
@_date: 2014-04-01 23:29:50


I really like that idea- put some of the onus / verification on the store receiver. In your mind, does the "donor" crowd funding aspect still fit in?


Absolutely. Due to the design of the AuroCoin going to the whole Icelandic population it had an interesting game mechanic that made you eligible regardless of interest or not, obviously this doesn't scale for whole world + BTC already distributed and valued!
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:19:38
Unless we move to more decentralized solutions! Decentralization makes large scale manipulation &amp; collapses less possible.
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:48:25
Hrm, interesting perspective. My company **Mailpile** has a blog, which we then blast Facebook, Twitter, and our email list with links to official statements. I wish there was decentralized (and Free) message syndication method aside from email, but people seem to comment and respond to our social media posts quite a bit!

Consider the future "Buy me a coffee, I'll send you 0.001 BTC (valued at $5,000)" Personally, I'd rather not have to say, think, or see 3 leading zeros &amp; a decimal when looking at how much BTC I've sent and received to gain a sense of my assets. What if BTC makes it to $50,000 or $100,000, then we're  **always** going to need a fiat translation layer to make sense of what 0.00005 BTC means, our brains are **never** going to feel comfortable thinking &amp; remembering value in terms of 5 zeros with a decimal somewhere in there. This of course is fine, if Goldman &amp; Sachs predictions are right and using BTC as currency is in fact a bad idea, and Bitcoin becomes used primarily for transferring large investments and payments!
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:07:53
Oh neat, didn't know that. Thanks ;)

I tried to buy a fancy cigarette lighter from a friend in BTC, it was worth $40 USD, they were all for it, as soon as they realized they were only going to receive 0.05 BTC, they seemed offended and said "No, nevermind, I don't want that trivial amount of BTC." Another friend, was SHOCKED to learn one can even buy a fraction of a Bitcoin "Seriously, you can buy 0.01 BTC? How much is that worth?" To which I responded "Well, what's 1% of, hold on lemme check the exchange rate... 1% of $765 is... move the decimal two places... $7.65"
Of course, smart people can figure all this out given enough time &amp; conversations, but I for one would really like to minimize how much I have to explain this stuff again and again.  What we're trying to do is something revolutionary and completely different from existing financial systems. Asking people to adapt to the newness of BTC and ALSO relearning how to think about numbers and monetary value is too high a barrier to entry for many people!

The Winkelvii, the Melon dude, and not to mention the $280 Million in VC money... Old money / banks didn't see the need / build actually useful  websites for years after the web was shaking things up.

I have been emailing friends who have expressed interest in buying BTC and giving them the solid facts about the current situation and encouraging them to buy!

Development takes time. Tasks that one anticipates to take 2 days, take 4. Unexpected things happen, especially when developing for a new &amp; evolving protocol (consider the transaction malleability that just shook the community). The lead dev gets a nasty flu bug and can't code for a week. In conjunction this drag makes development slow down, lose momentum, and eventually come to a grinding halt. This is why in the startup world everyone is constantly chasing the next round of VC money- open source projects don't have this luxury. For one dev $50K is a decent chunk of change, it's enough money for 9 mo - 1 yr. considering they don't spend too much on beer &amp; new bike tires, but as soon as you add more developers or designers that money disappears really quickly.

Dah, re-reading it is "0.5 cents" not "5 cents" my bad- that was gross miscalculation! It still seems a bit high &amp; leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I'd rather pay $20 / year than have a fixed percentage like this, even tho at 310 trans / per month that would less than $20!

HOW did NO ONE in the community who worked at, had been around, or audited Gox in some way- NEVER sound the call for alarm that they didn't use friggin version control? That seems like a failure of a larger community!

Agreed. There are many efforts to figure out what to do with the plastic. Of course thing biggest thing we can all do is STOP buying projects wrapped in ridiculous amounts of plastic packaging!

Economically speaking it is non-effective, so is cleaning up damage from fires and hurricanes or wars (for the losing side).

I'm not sure where you get $200 / hour from. Also, even if he raises $50K in BTC, he'll still need to cash that out to fiat in order to eat and pay rent and that money WILL be taxed, so $50K is more like $35K, unless BTC goes really high again before he cashes out. In anycase, his IndieGoGo campaign is asking for normal fiat cash mainly.

Quinn Norton wrote a pretty informative piece about crypto currency 
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:10:47
I'm sorry- maybe I'm misunderstanding your proposal, but if it's going to cost users a fixed rate of 100 satoshis to send a single transaction, that seems like it can get waaaaaay out of hand. The amount you mention is negligible if a user only sent one BTC transaction per week- but at 10 transactions per day, that equals $0.50/day, or $15/month, and that assumes BTC stays at $500. Is it just me or does $15/month (or much higher as price rises) to spend my BTC seems far more unreasonable than what the current banksters charge me to use a debit card?
Why not just charge people a flat fee to download the packaged app? And then you could charge for yearly release updates.

Couldn't agree more. Naming all these freedom / privacy / open projects "dark" sets the tone that that they will ultimately stay in the "dark" of the publics perception, which is NOT what we need!

I just visited Paralelni Polis while in Prague over the weekend... it was INCREDIBLE. Really great coffee, music, and chill atmosphere. I'd hangout and get coffee there everyday, even if it wasn't a Bitcoin cafe. The co-working space and Institute of Cryptoanarchy are equally inspired. Definitely check it out!
