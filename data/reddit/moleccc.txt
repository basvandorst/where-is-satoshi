you probably can (trust them) to an extent, but why not just use a wallet that let's you manage your own keys like electrum (desktop) or mycelium (android)?
Both can be used with [trezor]( (use "bitfinex" checkout code for -20% bargain) and other hardware devices for increased security (those can also be backed up, btw, in case you're wondering)

It doesn't.


I don't know. This idea that "price follows difficulty" pops up every so often and the issue has been discussed ad infinitum.
Here's an old btctalk thread as an example:
[Is there evidence that there is a correlation between difficulty and price?](
I think it's mainly wishful thinking. "Look!! Some technical measure is going up exponentially!! Surely that must mean MOON ROCKET!!! CHOOCHOO MOFO!!!"
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:49:15

block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.
sounds good

It matter in the following case: let's say you have 3 addresses: 10 BTC, 10 BTC, 10 BTC and dust (10000 satoshi) is sent to each. Now you make a payment of 25000 satoshis. What'll happen? Depends on the wallet, but danger is all 3 addresses will be linked, which wouldn't happen without the dust.
@_date: 2015-06-06 21:08:21
it stayed low for a year, yes, but not at $2. More like at 5 or higher.
@_date: 2015-06-14 18:30:25
When using a passphrase you already can have similar security. The passphrase isn't stored on the trezor (entered on keyboard of host computer), but added to the seed. So someone stealing your trezor, even if he can get around the PIN protection, would still have to bruteforce your passphrase.
I don't see how your proposed multisig scheme adds more security.

@_date: 2015-12-22 07:20:52
I agree. However:
not using HD wallet is a design decision. **Implementing HD is work**.
**not syncing** newly generated keys to the server securely **is a severe BUG** that costs people money and **not fixing it** for years **is gross negligence**.

I remember he was on quite a rant when he said that and that it was in a video. I also remember discussing it on reddit, but I can't find that either.
I agree: Schiff is smart enough to not say that nonsense. I remember being really surprised at the time and maybe it was a misunderstanding: in the 3 videos I skipped through, he often makes the altcoin objection.

yes, this is true.

I honestly don't know what he meant. Could be you're right and it's delusional to attempt to overcome majority of mining power.
But incidentally this is basically very similar to what happened with that fork you mentioned (in case you mean the one sometime around March 2013). The majority of miners was actually on the "new fork" (the one that was able to digest the block with the many transactions). The "new chain" got ahead rather quickly, don't remember exactly how far, but more than 6 blocks.  **Only because most merchants / processors / exchanges still were on the "old fork" with incompatible bdb nodes could pool ops be "convinced" to switch back to the shorter chain.**

I hope you're right on this, but I'm not convinced.
The thing is: we want users to be able to make transactions. One of the most prevalent use cases is moving money to/from exchanges and this use case recently spiked the tx rate to 8 (looking at an average over ~20 minutes), while the baseline was around 1.8 tps before and after the event. **Those are not "low end" applications, those are users wanting to move money**... probably urgently, no less.

I agree. However, there's one problem: it might already be too late when it 'becomes a real problem'. I only started to use merge avoidance some time ago. Before I was just pretty careless and I kind of regret that now... some stuff was needlessly merged.
Everytime I hear people say things like 'and then I just moved all the funds to the new wallet', I cringe. I even went to the length of migrating single inputs to separate adresses within the new target wallet when I was getting rid of an old qt wallet once. I also lable all receiving adresses so I know the source of the funds later.
Is that being a bit paranoid? Not sure, depends on what the future brings.

btw, [here]( a nice interview with Mike about the block size limit. He also talks about bitcoinxt and why/how things could play out.
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:46:11


From my point of view, **we've always had a bitcoin that never really hit the blocksize limit**, as if there hadn't ever been one. It was implemented as a temporary anti-spam measure and now some have the balls to assert that this is somehow the "bitcoin as it was envisioned by satoshi" and that this shouldn't be changed. I disagree: the 1 MB limit is the change and removing it is making bitcoin whole again.
I've always assumed that the bitcoin I fell in love with and devoted much energy to would somehow scale. In the beginning I didn't even know about the block size limit. Now, it could be that bitcoin just doesn't easily scale. But imo 1 MB is not the point to decide this.
So for me, **letting bitcoin hit this artifical limit *is* the 'change to a new money'.** Removing the limit *is* keeping bitcoin as it was meant to be: unlimited.
btw, slightly off-topic (but not really): I recently listened to the "let's talk bitcoin" interview with Peter Todd about his **Tree Chains**. I have to say I'm quite excited about it, at least if it works how I understand it. Of course I have many questions. Let's get this block limit debate out of the way so we can focus our energies on more important things. Hell, I'd even be ok with just doing 8 MB and nothing more. But even that is too much for some apparently. I'd much rather look at something like tree chains than have discussions poisoned with the debate all the time and everyones energy bound by them.
@_date: 2015-06-20 11:13:23
Thank you. Light will start to fall onto the unknown.
In case we experience the beginnings of a crash-landing with this test, I can already predict what some of the 1MB crowd will be saying: 


Now, I'm not saying this is wrong and I agree this is a possible future for Bitcoin (although one I don't prefer).
But consider one thing: **there are a bunch of very powerful people that would just *love* to see Bitcoin fail**. This issue can truly break bitcoin (both with upper and lowercase "B"). Divide and conquer: it really works.
We currently struggle hard to find consensus (which *is* what bitcoin is also about). Failing to find and implement something now can throw us back many years (if not forever) and there are powerful people who will whole-heartedly (and rightfully) laugh at us and continue to enslave us with their broken fiat for many years to come.
**Let's not do them that favor!**
Again, thanks coinwallet for putting some pressure and hopefully shedding some light on this issue.

It doesn't try to solve scalability, the goal is just to make things behave more gracefully when approaching the limit.

No, they will accelerate it ;9
But I agree. Next bullrun is coming. It's just a question of timescale. I think 2016 (around halving or some time after that) might be a good time. Some think it's going to take longer than that and I thinkk it's possible. Everything is so much slower than with the previous 'bubbles'. More people, more inertia, more time... Some think it's just around the corner (September!) and that's also possible given sufficient troubles in the financial / monetary system.

Well, I guess it's true: re-shuffling would increase security and some info is lost to the attacker in the current implementation.
However I think a tradeoff is made between usability and security (as so often): it's rather easy to look at the trezor pin pad, identify the whole pattern of your pin at once and keep it in mind, entering it in one go. Makes the process much faster and less painfull than shown in the video. This uage pattern would of course be impossible by reshuffling.
Optional reshuffling after each key might be a good idea.

The beauty of such "block compression" schemes is that they can be used amongst miners without requiring consensus, "on top" of bitcoin, so to say. I wouldn't be surprised if some variant of this was already in use by a group of miners/pools. The economic incentive is not insusbstantial.

I managed to stubbornly hold on to my coins I had from before, but I didn't have a lot of fiat to buy more. I managed to spend €150 on BTC at the prague conference. A very good investment that netted me ~70 BTC.

I think this might be a misconception. I would call such a container a "depository". 
A *bank* engages in [credit creation]( It's operation is highly intertwined with the modus operandi of the fiat currency they handle.
Bitcoin doesn't work this way. It's a commodity money that exists without needing any credit creation infrastructure. Therefore Bitcoin threatens the banking system in general, at least the one entangled with the fiat currencies.

I understand your reasoning and support it to *some* extent.
However, you seem to neglect that crypto is also used as a store of wealth. Are you going to store your life-savings in doge-coin or AUR? Hell no, you'll use the most secure coin for that (secure both regarding value stability and network security). Looks to me that's bitcoin and will be for a long time. (see [excellent post by killerstorm about alt security](
All the alts relate to BTC and the BTC/ALT markets are quite liquid. People keep money in alts only for the purpose of payment (to a very low degree) and speculation (to an overwhelming degree).
Altcoins are a playground for technology development and also gambling.

The cop actually agreed with me that it was actually safer for everybody than riding on the other side according to the rules (very crowded with a quite dangerous two-way bike path with trees and bends and shit,... had quite a few close calls on that path).
So he was of my opinion that what he was giving me a ticket for was actually a better option compared to following the rules.

After next block reward halving (probably around the time of the next price hike), mining will consolidate further and fees should fall, because they make up a larger part of miners revenue.
If that's still too high or price-hike happens earlier, there are some technical measures that can be employed to lower fees. For example O(1) block propagation can re-incentivise miners to include low-fee transactions.

Thanks for the info. That FLUSH+RELOAD attack is indeed interesting. But it's a side-channel attack on the signing machine and thus not what the slides talk about ("Exploiting ECDSA failure *in the Blockchain*"). 
Also: if an attacker is in a position to run a side-channel attack on your signing machine, he likely has some lower-hanging fruit to attack than a key that will be useless moments later, no?

The "barter" story is most likely just that: a story.
Ancient tribes more likely tracked debt in other ways than by using tokens like sheep, salt or gold. Tribes were small enough for debts to be tracked socially without having to have even a ledger.
The use of commodities as money only became necessary when trade needed to be facilitated among larger groups of people and therefore there was low trust.
The book [Debt: the first 5000 years]( has more insights on this.

        // to spend something, then we consider it dust.
        // A typical txout is 34 bytes big, and will
        // need a CTxIn of at least 148 bytes to spend,
        // so dust is a txout less than 54 uBTC
        // (5460 satoshis) with default nMinRelayTxFee

2140 is accurate but making assumptions (that difficulty adjustment will result in halfing of reward every 4 years). 4 years shouldn't be off by much (it depends on the changes in hashrate over time), though: the first halfing was only roughly two months (about 4%) early due to constantly rising hashing power.
So yes: the last satoshi will very likely be mined no earlier than 2136 or so... maybe never.
However: from 2040 to 2140 only roughly 40,000 BTC (0.2% of the total supply) will be mined, so 2040 isn't as far off as it may seem.

I will take some time to elaborate on why I think your call for regulation is misguided.


I think it might hurt a great deal, depending on the kind of regulation applied. On a general side-note: what jurisdiction are you talking about? All of them?


**Running off with peoples coins is theft. There is already regulation against theft** in most jurisdictions.
Being hacker-proof is something that is hard to do and it'd probably be even harder to verify proofness against hackers. The free market and evolution of exchanges (survival of the fittest) are far more efficient ways to reach the goal of having exchanges that are more secure against theft of the coins by third parties.
There's a pretty cool idea called [voting pools]( that could largely alleviate the hacking problem. However, I don't think it would be prudent to force the exchanges to use something like this by regulation. This *can* hurt: who says it's the right way to go, who says it really works? It incurs a lot of cost on the exchanges (users in the end) without proof that it really works. There might be other, even better options that would not even be tried out *due to* that regulation. So yes, I think regulation "can in fact hurt". I event think regulation *does in fact hurt* most of the time.
You can't just regulate into existence all the features you would like to see in an exchange. Otherwise we could just regulate world peace should prevail and be done with war, right? On top of that: who says the regulators are getting it right... they are just humans and on top of that under pressure from lobbyists who don't have the well-being of the consumer as a top priority but protection of their business (or monopoly) against innovative newcomers. **Regulation can stifle innovation.**


There are pretty straight-forward ways to make the bitcoins an exchange holds auditable, even on a per-user basis (an exchange could just have one address per customer and publish those (which address belongs to which customer would only be disclosed to the respective customers, of course) for public auditing)
**We need innovation and a free market, not regulation.**
I suggest people start demanding the features they want to see from their exchange from the exchanges they (potentially) use, not from regulators who will then force things upon them. It's the wrong way to go and it obviously doesn't work (mf global customer funds disappropriation, hsbc money laundering, price fixing in many (if not all) markets are just some examples of regulation simply failing)

Geldeintreiber is correct. There's a wealth of information here:  (german, sorry).
The consensus is you have to report your gains (or losses) from selling Bitcoin and you'll pay income tax on the gain (if you held for less than a year). I've done this personally for the years 2011 and 2012. My taxes have been accepted (albeit without anything more than my report of the gains (two numbers per year: "proceeds from selling BTC" minus "cost of acquiring BTC" equals "gains from Bitcoin saleds"))
People still fight the view that a trade (car vs. bitcoin, for example) constitutes a sale of Bitcoin for the buyer of the car, but I fear this view is correct. It's also a "BTC buy" for the seller of the car and when he sells the BTC again, he has to report the gain/loss. It doesn't work for the car, btw, because it's an "object of daily use" and according to german tax regulation, you can't claim a loss when you sell your old car because of that.
btw: contrary to what the headlines might suggest, no new law has been enacted regarding cryptocurrency in germany. It has merely been cleared up how Bitcoin fits into existing regulation.

I think it's a bit late for that (not saying we shouldn't do it, just that it might not be so fruitful). 
**We should instead demand auditability from the exchanges that are still alive and used by us every day.**
It's easy for an exchange to prove how many BTC it holds. The other part is proving how many BTC it *should* hold (the liabilities towards its depositors).
Thanks to gmaxwell and others this is also quite easy to do. [Here's]( an implementation of a scheme (blind liability proof) which allows an exchange to build a (blinded) tree of the liabilities that allow it to 
 * publish the root node reporting the sum of the liabilities and
 * give data to each customer that proves that his particular deposit is included in that sum 
Please write to your exchange and demand they offer this. Let's see some competition on transparency.

I would say it's a personal wallet if exactly you have access to the keys.
Assuming blockchain.info does not have access to your keys (they shouldn't: they store them encrypted and keys are only decrypted in your browser) and you have a backup of your wallet, this is the case: you can theoretically decrypt your backup and import the private keys into some other wallet.
So I'd say: yes, it's probably to be considered a personal wallet (with caveats)

We're not looking at trading. The volume generated by daytraders and speculation on the 'other' exchanges you mention dwarfs the volume generated by buying/selling that has roots and reasons in the economy.
That's why this is interesting data. It excludes volume generated by daytrading, speculation, liquidations, etc.
You don't daytrade on localbitcoins (the fees are too high and transaction too slow and cumbersome)


You are partly correct. Some of the volume is probably speculative (people buying to hold and planning to sell later), but it's much better than huobi or bitfinex data in that regard, because it excludes daytraders and bots.

Market dynamics: 
**Negative feedback**
Usually there is a dampening effect prevalent in the market
 * when price rises, demand decreases and supply increases
 * when price falls, demand increases and supply decreases 
It's pretty easy to see: at lower prices there's more people willing to buy, at higher prices there's more people willing to sell.
This has dampening effect on price movement: each time the price wants to take a hike in any direction, it's slowed down by this.
This is called **negative feedback**, because a result of the process influences the process itself in such a way that **it reduces changes**.
However in some situations like now there are stronger effects that resemble **positive feedback**. With positive feedback, the results of the process influence the process itself in such a way that the **magnitude of the change increases**.
I can think of a couple of things that might currently be in effect and have a positive feedback on falling price: 
 * Miners: miners are forced to sell part of the mined coins to cover fiat expenses. A falling price causes them to increase the percentage of coins they have to sell =&gt; positive feedback
 * Margin calls, forced liquidation:  falling price can trigger leveraged longs on exchange to be automatically liquidated, which results in more selling =&gt; positive feedback
 * Market participant psychology: falling price causes frustration, anger, and fear in at least some market participants, which in turn causes them to sell =&gt; positive feedback.
So: the system is out of balance.
Fortunately, all of the above positive feedback effects are dependant on some resource that is reduced and ultimately depleted in the process:
 * miners: they cannot sell more than 100%
 * liquidations: there's only so many longs
 * psychology: the panic-sellers have only a limited amount of coins
So don't worry: the imbalance to the downside is only temporary ;-)

Just had an idea: say I receive a block with an IBLT (A)... I subtract my own current IBLT (B) to get C = A - B. If C is in "readable" state all is fine, if not (because too many txs contained), I can do the following to try to "rescue" it:
* Start removing one by one transactions from C. Start with the newest one I have added and work my way back in time (receiving time that is).
* if that fails, start over, but this time add one by one transactions I have received since I built my IBLT (B).
If the differences stem indeed largely from the "ragged edge" (as you called it), this mechanism seems very likely to succeed in getting a meaningful and readable difference IBLT (C).

Internally on their site and network, you always have $50 worth of Bitcoin. Even if Bitcoin's exchange rate rises or falls, it never changes.

By "its currency aspect" I mean the fact that bitcoin is sound money. I'd rather use the term money here than currency.
Apart from the properties you listed above (medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value), sound money also has to have: transportability, fungibility, recognizability, scarcity. Except for fungibility (it's a bit on shaky grounds), Bitcoin excels at these properties.
I agree with you that Bitcoin will need a lot more time to develop its 'store of value' and 'unit of account' properties.
For me, Bitcoin has 2 main advantages compared to gold/fiat: transportability (censorship resistance) and scarcity (known 'un-managed' supply).
I don't want to downplay the payment network aspect, it's essential for Bitcoin to have this... otherwise we'd be looking at something like gold with less historical monetary use.
The 2 aspects of Bitcoin ('sound money' and 'good enough payment network') play hand-in-hand and fertilize each other.
I can understand when people emphasize the payment system aspect and keep talking about the developments in the payment markets and how bitcoin will drive cost down. For them it's a 'payments battle'. I think more importantly what's going on in the world in a much broader sense is a 'currency war' (actually a 'money war'). It's about power and control. Crypto can be the defense of the people against oppression.

you must be new here.
An elastic money supply (one that can be manipulated by printing and also by removing money from the money supply, although that doesn't seem to happen much) leads to **capital misallocations** and **distorted price signals**. The markets and economy cannot function efficiently. 
**Low interest rates** (a result of excessive money printing (or "QE") the "cost of money" goes down) make it **economically unfeasable to save**. Thus the **function of saving** (sending signal to economy to reduce immediate production and put capital elsewhere (like increasing productivity and efficiency, innovating, etc.)) **is destroyed** or at least greatly reduced.
Low interest rates also cause **bubbles (boom and bust cycles)**.
In addition money printing is simply **theft** and therefore highly unjust, because the fresh money isn't injected fairly, but in a concentrated manner. Those who get it first have a tremendous advantage.
It also inevitably leads to **price inflation** (we're not seeing this in full force regarding commodities yet currently because most of the money is used up to save the insolvent banks by inflating stock, real estate and other equity bubbles ("prop up those balance sheets!") and it can lead to hyperinflation, **loss of trust in the currency** and finally it's **destruction**.

I thought about the following solution for anonymous package receiving that is simpler than your approach and should be much cheaper:
Goods are packaged in normed boxes that unlock themselves only if someone presents the correct key (via nfc or other means) to the box. The key is programmed to the box by the sender (after it was given to him by the intended recipient anonymously).
There are pickup stations you can have your package sent to. Note that the sender doesn't even need to program the recipient station... that can be done by the recipient (via some support network), authenticating via the same key used to open the box.
To pick up anonymously you wait for arrival of the package at the pickup station (the package notifies you via bitmessage or similar), visit it, go to the backroom (alone) with all the boxes waiting for pickup or for further routing and open 'your' box, take the goods, close the box and leave.
That way neither the sender nor the delivery personell know your identity.
Would this work?

We've been trying to get the goldbugs on board since at least 2011. In 2013 we finally had some success. (big thanks to Trace Meyer who played a vital role in this)
Jeff Berwick came around pretty early, also Brother John F. In 2013 finally even Mike Maloney and James Turk opened up quite a bit.
Of course we still have some metal heads that will probably never come around, like Chris Duane, Andy Hoffman or Doug Casey. They still have trust issues with Bitcoin ("can't touch it") or problems overcoming their shame of having missed the train.
In general I think it's a good time to do a gold vs. bitcoin trade at this point if you're heavy on the metals compared to crypto. For an ongoing discussion of gold vs. bitcoin, see [this bitcointalk thread](

What stick said is true, you can make multiple accounts inside one wallet (a different bip32 derivation path is used, for example account one is 44'0'0', account 2 is 44'0'1').
In addition a trezor can be made to hold any number of wallets by using different passphrases. The passphrase is simply added to the seed, that way you get a completely separate wallet for every distinct passphrase.

sorry for off-topic, but I want to explain this: I hate microsoft with a passion, I really do. But this device (a surface pro 2) was simply exactly what I was looking for when I searched for a new mobile computer. Now I actually use it even for eclipse-based development work because it's got plenty of power, of course with a real keyboard and large screen connected. Even though very small, the full HD screen offers the real-estate I need to work and connecting a 2560x1600 panel is not problem. As a plus I can type really well on the keyboard and the battery last for quite a long time. Only thing I'm missing is a wired ethernet connection.

That's not redemption, that's trading.
Redemption requires an authority (usually the issuer) to promise to exchange your currency (or whatever) for something else at a (semi-)fixed rate.
For example: the US Dollar used to be redeemable in a certain amount of gold. You used to be able to redeem it at certain banks at fixed rates.
So no, bitcoins are not redeemable in that sense. (unless we count in that one guy who set aside €21 to back the Bitcoin by the EUR by offering to redeem a bitcoin for a millionth of a EUR)

you can't start mining the next block if you only have the header of the previous one. You need to know the transaction so you can adjust your utxo table, otherwise you don't know which transactions to mine.
The only way out would be to mine an empty (except coinbase tx) block, which defeats the purpose of bringing fees down.

It's really quite different from bitcoin in the sense that you can have bots (contracts) living in the blockchain that can have funds and be activated by sending transactions to them. They can themselves make transactions.

I don't think you'll need to be reminded by the bot.
If the last halfing is any indication, it will be on everyones mind and everyone and his grandma will discuss wether the halfing has been priced in already or the price will double or go up a whole magnitue.
Then the halfing will happen. On the day itself, nothing special will happen to price. But when some time later (weeks, I'd say) there is a huge really, everyone will act all surprised and pull things like cyprus out of their hats to explain it.

Nono. It's not about the pricing. It's about strongly incentivizing the world to use the USD for international trade of oil. Why? Because that makes the USD very strong. What happened to Saddam Hussein (previously payed by the CIA, btw), when he started to offer Irak oil for EUR? Right: they invaded his country and killed him. I'm not defending him, but the reason the US went into the Irak war was not the existence of weapons of mass destruction. That was a blatant lie used as an excuse for the aggression.

It makes sense to have VAT on the trading fee, because the exchange provides the value of matching buyers and sellers.
German bitcoin.de for example charges 19% VAT on their trading fee.
In germany it seems regulators are of the opinion that 19% VAT should also be charged by miners (and given to the tax-man, of course) who "create" bitcoins, but I'm not really sure about that.

Hi _____
As we approach Ross’ trial on January 5, we want to express our immense gratitude to all his supporters. We’ve been able to mount a strong defense and employ important forensic experts because of the generosity of so many people.
However, in these final hours, we still need help! The lawyers predict weekly costs of $35,000 during the trial. Please donate what you can [here](
We also need to fly character witnesses to New York to testify. If you have airline miles you’d like to donate please email freerossulbricht
And for a great fashion statement, we have t-shirts and tote bags for sale [here]( and on Cafepress.
Ross is working hard on his defense (now that he has the evidence, which was obstructed and delayed since March). He is staying strong and courageous. We are proud of him for the way he is handling this daunting situation and remaining a positive force in the prison.
Lyn has stayed busy speaking publicly to the greater issues of the case and the precedent that could be set. See her interview on ReasonTV with Nick Gillespie:
[Silk Road. Online Freedom, and Why the Prosecution of Ross Ulbricht Should Worry Us All](
We are hopeful, and even optimistic, that we will prevail and Ross will spend 2015 a free man. Our immense gratitude to everyone who is helping make that happen.
The Ulbricht family
 
Another easy way to help Ross: invite your friends to like the Free Ross Facebook page and follow us on Twitter though the links below.

I don't think this guy has thought about how crypto works enough.
**Comparing to bank failures during the free-banking period is misguided in my mind.**
Bitcoin cannot easily increase the money supply at will (by design), as was possible for a privately issued currency back then.
Money supply increase by means of alt-coins popping up is unlikely to be a problem because these are easily discernable from each other so the trust of the people will not confuse them.
Fractional reserve banking with bitcoin is also unlikely. The reasons for using money substitutes historically was lower transaction and storage cost. This is only marginally applicable to Bitcoin (only thing I can think of where a substitute by virtue of 3rd party could be beneficial to some is security against theft or loss). Even if it comes to that (one could argue it's already the case, many people use exchanges as wallets or similar), the underlying BTC are easily auditable. As long as people demand that auditability (they should and currently they don't do this to a large enough extent, I give you that), fractional reserve banking is unlikely to be done in a substantial way.

hey guys, owner of the laptop and two of the hands in the picture here.
I think I need to put some things into perspective.
I'm not part of the trezor team but I got to play with a trezor at the bxb event.
It was an awesome experience. I love this device.
**The bug that occurred was not caused by the trezor or the wallet, but by a known bug in my USB stack** (this is arch linux on a microsoft surface, and there are issues with the wifi usb driver) that causes the USB bus to reset. Actually the wallet and trezor recovered just fine from the reset, just took time and slowed things down.
I tried initializing the trezor (worked), wiping the trezor (worked), restoring the trezor from the backed-up seed (worked), receiving money (worked), sending money (worked), reloading wallet (after wiping local storage) from trezor (worked), firmware upgrade (worked).
The PIN-entry is genious. The device displays a reordered set of 9 number keys and you punch them in by position on the wallet page. That way a keylogger on the host computer doesn't learn the PIN, but you still proved to the trezor that you know it.
After talking to slush for a while, I now know a lot about trezor, so if you have questions, just ask away.
EDIT: added some more info

That would be the sane approach. Of course: service fees are subject to tax. But I really *do* think they mean the Bitcoin itself is taxed: buy one bitcoin, invoice says (according to my interpretation of what the BMF says):

* service fee (5%): €18,50
* sum netto: €388,50
* VAT 19%: €88,80
* **total: 458,80**
when really it should be (and what you interpret the BMF to say):
* 1 BTC: €370
* service fee (5%): €18,50
* sum netto: €388,50
* VAT 19% on service fee: €3,51
* **total: €391,01**

you *make* reality.
it's quite exciting.
currently facts are made by corporate-sponsored experts who essentially write studies which then become accepted 'facts'. Remember when spinach contained a lot of iron? It was a decimal point error in some measurement, but everybody took it as fact. It was unintentional in this case, but there's loads of intentional (and more subtle than my example) alterations of facts. What is truth anyways. With some things it can be defined as a sort of 'consensus'. If the majority believes it, it's true. So he who influences what people believe (religions, media, 'experts',...) actually shape reality.
think about it, truth is quite malleable. Maybe fact-producers like realitykeys (I applaud your effort, btw) and other 'oracles' might  play the role of political parties or even religions. They might well have openly biased agendas and fact models according to some set of core beliefs. People would make contracts based on certain oracles ("This contract is based on facts from 'enlightenment 2.0', 'church of the flying spaghetti monster' and 'the reasonable oracle'. In case of contradiction in contract-deciding facts, the majority of oracles decides the fact")
more to think about: what is history, who controls the facts of the past. **Putting facts into the blockchain is pretty exciting. It means we can have a historical records of past events that cannot be changed.** That's important. He who controls the view of historical events has great power. No more changing of history books would be possible.
more thoughts: what about language / encoding of facts. You guys at reality keys are probably much more aware and knowledgable about these things.
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:21:25
Use adequate financial instruments:
A way I can think of to do this is to regularly buy call options in the volume of expected returns (plus some) with adequate maturity. If you need to process a refund and the customer wishes to get his BTC back because exchange rate went north, you just execute part of one of the call options you have bought to get the customers BTC back at the price you sold them for.
Unfortunately due to bitcoins high volatility such options are likely too expensive. Of course this depends on your rate of refunds occurring. If you're big enough, you can probably have a good expectation of this rate, though.
This should be the job of the guys in your company that already do the forex hedging. They should be able to calculate the cost and also to pull it off.
There's probably more markets, but one place I know that trades BTC options (and has been for a long time) is mpex.co.
This eliminates the risk, but it incurs some cost.
On a side-note: this could be a good service to be offered by the payment service provider (bitpay et al)

So yes, you could theoretically make your own backend and use the opensource frontend with it, but it wouldn't be "plug and play".
And yes, of course: trezor itself (firmware, protocol,...) is all open, which is the main concern of course. Just saying: that web wallet (however nice it may be) is only an interim solution for me. I'll likely end up using multibit, electrum, darkwallet, armory, bitcoin core or whichever wallet has support for trezor first and allows me a certain level of "coin control" and privacy.

something like [contracts using external state]( would be needed.
That is: the scripting engine would have to be able to pull in external state (like the BTC/USD exchange rate) from the internet.
This isn't implemented and I fear it wont be for a long time, since that requires extension of the scripting engine. It'd be a hard-forking change, I guess.

what do you mean by "taxing Bitcoin". I was of the impression that gains from sale of bitcoins were already taxable under standard regulation, no?

Ok, thanks for your explanation.
I still think it's a bit misleading to think of it as voting, especially from a transactors perspective.
Essentially, everyone is incentivized to mine the longest chain and use standard rules to have their work accepted.
The way he described it made me think miners would somehow get together and discuss every transaction individually. In reality however, one can expect a certain set of rules to be followed with quite high certainty and the miners don't somehow discuss individual transactions. They're finding consensus, sure, but they're not voting on single transactions.

Just for reference, I [reported the exact same problem]( (this time with the iOS wallet) in April 2012.
I suggested the following to mitigate the problem:
* at least mark addresses that are not synced to server clearly as "non-synced", **as the online wallet does**
* display a big fat warning before showing the qr-code of an un-synced address
Back then, the problem in the iOS wallet was [quickly fixed](
I wasn't aware this same problem existed with the web wallet. From the bolded part above I deduct the web wallet back then displayed addresses as non-synced until they had been synced to the server. Seems that essential 'feature' got lost along the way somehow.

You have a point: being easier on earth does not directly follow from using sound money.
Just 2 effects that might help:
 * if it turns out correct that the general (average?) level of wealth (I don't necessarily mean money) is greater, than it will be easier for people to be environmentally aware in their choices. (It's hard to make a choice if you're low on money.)
 * I think a lot of things are done in the current system that lead to overconsumption. We're intentionally producing goods that fall apart after 2 years (or whatever the warranty period is). My hope is that this wastefulness would stop with sound money. The 'continuous growth paradigm' would be broken. The current emphasis on the 'jobs problem' would be weakened.
Increased prosperity doesn't necessarily mean more growth or more consummation.

There's also cancercoin.org, for example. Not sure about protein-folding. Also a storage/bandwidth coin that incentivises provision of bandwidth and storage to a network would likely be a gamechanger... not sure if doable, though.
A problem to be used for proof of work in a coin has to...
 * be configurable (take hash of block header as input)
 * be hard to solve (with the possibility to dynamically adjust the 'hardness')
 * have an efficient way to verify wether a given solution is correct
(I just recalled this from head, please correct me if wrong).
It becomes very hard to find such a problem when you add
 * the solution to the problem should also be useful for something other than reaping the block reward of a coin
people have been searching for something like that for a long time and I don't think anything really useful came out of that search so far... we'd surely know. Closest is probably primecoin (incentivising certain research), I'm not sure cancercoin works.

How much smaller would an IBLT *without* the data be?
If it's considerably smaller, maybe something like this could be done:
Initial block message contains only a non-data-IBLT.
If it checks out on the receiving end, the node can evaluate how many transactions it would have to fetch. If it's a low enough number, it could just request them using 'getdata', if it's a little higher, a data-containing-IBLT (same keys as the non-data-IBLT, but with the acutal data) could be requested.

I think I understand.
I think it's not O(1), though:
Let's say the connectivity of the network is such that a block usually travels 4 hops before having reached every node.
Let's say it takes on average 3 seconds to transfer the block.
With your idea a block propagates in roughly the time it takes to transfer it 1 hop: 3 seconds.
With current implementation it takes 4 * 3 = 12 seconds.
However: your 3 seconds are still dependent on the block size. If the block is twice as big, it takes 6 seconds.
That's still O(n) (although you brought the constant down by a factor of 4, which is impressive and desirable).

cross-post from btctalk
I just had an idea (probably not the first to have it, though):
**Why not marry DarkWallet and Trezor?**
* + stealth address support
* + coinjoin support
* + multisig
* + BIP-32
* + (hopefully) diverse backend infrastructure
* - stores keys on host machine
* + secure key storage
* + tx signing
* + BIP-32
* - (seems to me) centralized backend
* ? not sure about coin control features
So how about taking "the best of both worlds" and do away with DarkWallets insecure (?) key storage and the privacy issues (?) of the myTrezor wallet? It seems to me one project has what the other lacks.
Both projects are opensource and I'm sure darkwallet devs would welcome a trezor pull request if done well enough. Trezor team is looking for wide-spread wallet integration so I can't imagine they would be opposed in any way.
* Should we go for it?
* What are the technical hurdles to overcome?
* What are potential problems?
* Who's going to do it?

What is a "cash advance"? (sorry for asking, non-US citizen, I don't use credit cards)
Sounds like you could get cash from your card somehow? If so, you're not paying your friend with your credit card, you're paying him with cash.
I'd like to see someone receive $3 from his friend using just 2 credit cards.

look into [btchip]( if you want something more affordable. 
Don't be fooled by the pictures on that page. The BTChip can be broken out of that card and turned into a usb-stick-like device.
It's not quite as secure as the trezor (no display, basically the banking industry is hardware vendor (smart card)), but it comes close and a price of ~$15 I think is affordable for a good nights sleep.
I still recommend the trezor as the better option, though.

really makes you think...
sort of like "ripple vs. bitcoin"
the main difference is that a debt-based monetary system requires trust (or authority by force or whatever) while commodity-based monetary system functions essentially trustless (at least regarding the ownership and transfer mechanisms, not the 'value' of the commodity)
The tinfoil-hat part of me is thinking the barter story might be designed to make us think that debt-based money is somehow more modern and preferrable to commodity money (the "barbarous relic"). Imagine the story was: "In ancient time, debt was recorded and that was money. Later commodity-based money, which required much less trust, was invented, became widely used, and enabled global trade. Later we re-introduced debt-based money because, well, you'll just have to trust us with that: it's just better (for us, that is, but we don't tell you that)".
I truly believe debt-based money doesn't work well with a group of 8 billion people: it introduces a large amount violence and inequality.
I fell we're better off with sound money.

did you even watch the video? The guy talks about the concept of ownership applied to bitcoin in general, be it one bitcoin or one satoshi.
His point is that the bitcoin exists 'out there' in the distributed ledger, not on peoples harddrives. The people only have the private keys that allow spending the associated coins. So he poses the question: Do you really own a bitcoin if you have control over one (at least that's how I understood the video)
There are interesting 'philosophical' questions, like "where are the bitcoins", "who issued them", "do all 21 million already exist and are just inaccessible at this point".
I think the questions about posession and ownership are probably most interesting to be viewed in a legal context. Fortunately I don't know shit about that so I take the pragmatic view: whoever controls the private key, controls the associated bitcoins. I don't care who owns them legally (I also don't care if they exist or where they are located). 
If someone passes me control over some coins, that's valuable for me because I assume other people will value that transfer of control, too.

Which is more transparent / honest:
 * we hold $50 for you
 * we hold $50 worth of BTC for you. However, that BTC balance will constantly adjust according to exchange rate fluctuation as if we actually held $50 for you. This means what we really do is hold $50 for you and display $50 / &lt;current exchange rate&gt; = x BTC in order to fool you into thinking you own bitcoins and in addition give you a false sense of security by using words like "insurance" or "volatility protection" and make you think we're doing serious hard work for you.

I would say the winning block is the one I can start to mine on first. If I only have the header, I can't do that.
I think maybe Gavins example wasn't very good: A much simpler one (with no race at all) will suffice: 
I start receiving a block. I know the header already and it checks out. So I know someone mined a block. But I'm still downloading the transactions. What can I do at this point? Nothing, I will still mine on the block I mined on before, right? This is the current situation. It sucks, because it will create an orphan when I mine a block now (either my block or the received one will be orphaned)
The block header just tells me someone found a block, it doesn't enable me to build on it without knowing the transactions.
Gavins proposal solves this neatly. It simply makes use of the fact that "most of the information about the transactions in the block" are already in everyones mempool.

            value = msg.data[1]
            if fromvalue &gt;= value:
                contract.storage[from] = fromvalue - value
                contract.storage[to] = contract.storage[to] + value
                return(1)
            else:
                return(0)
            
so this "contract" or "agent" or whatever lives on the ethereum blockchain (or whatever they use), can own ether and pay it to execute code and/or use storage. At least that's my rough understanding.

increasing commodity prices have a lot to do with money printing: the newly printed money has to flow somewhere. Currently it's predominantly blowing up stock and real estate bubbles. 
Generally monetary inflation leads to price inflation. However the price inflation is not evenly distributed among the asset classes. Most of it flows into those asset which are owned by banks currently to make their balance sheet look less catastrophic. This is also why it's possible for the governments to change the commodity basket they use to calculate official price inflation numbers in order to cook the numbers a bit (see [shadowstats]( for more insight on this).
Of course wage stagnation is not a result of money printing.

I'm for it for other reasons: 
* 2 decimals eases software integration, 
* it's pretty future-proof, 
* zeros before the decimal point are easy for humans to handle as opposed to zeros after the decimal point. 
* "bit" has been used for money before.
milliBits is just cumbersome and half-baked. Like it or not, people have problems with micros, millis, nanos, etc.. 
Just having one unit (bits) with 2 decimals is the most "human" option which also can be digested by all financial software out there.

I think many wont. Hell, I know people who used mtGox as a wallet and circle is even more geared towards that use-case if I'm not mistaken. I wish they'd use some multisig scheme or at least prof of reserves of some kind.
Let me be frank: I fear that a majority of the next big wave of newbees could be *captured* by circle (everybody will be recommending circle for buying because "it's so easy, fast AND free!!").
I can't really put my finger on why I attribute bad stuff with circle. Maybe it's Jeremy Allaire and what I heard him say in the past. Maybe it's his/circles attitude towards regulation (embrace and use to build monopoly or at least cartel?).
I somehow fear circle might become to powerful and maybe even engage in fractional BTC banking at some point. At the very least I'm pretty sure they will fully comply with any law enforcement request for information or account lock-down. That's bad enough already, no?
I always cringe when people are asked by some newb how to buy coins and their first answer is circle/coinbase, it's so easy. It really should be: go to a local bitcoin meetup, use localbitcoins. Oh, and btw: not only criminals should to think about privacy.

If so, that's bullish at that future point, no? Thief is already selling now and has been selling as much as he wants/wanted to.... so no change there =&gt; equal supply
But some people suddenly have less BTC than they would like to have. If they have fiat or assets to sell, they might want to acquire more coins =&gt; increased demand.
equal supply &amp; increased demand =&gt; higher price
even if mtGox is not insolvent (as in your worst-case news scenario), but are merely short on BTC due to theft, that's *also* bullish because they have to acquire the BTC to make their customers whole. **Maybe that's why they're FUDding: so they can get cheaper coins.**

no it doesn't. The trick is to view it as a transfer of BTC, not USD.

It would be interesting to see what happens when someone buys bitcoins for x$ every week. (dollar-cost averaging, a method recommended by many to those who want to get into bitcoin)
EDIT: here's what happened to someone who bought BTC for 1$ every day since Jan 1st 2013:
He now owns 6 BTC and payed USD 466 for those (average price of 77.50 USD/BTC).
His stash is now worth 6 * 430 USD = 2,580 USD. So he's up 453%.

Even if you had the password hash and you could try 1 petahashes per second, you'd still need 750804889675 years to bruteforce it.
It's quite strong.
However: I just rechecked and it's only 15 characters... not strong enough. Only 2 days with above setup.
However it requires the salts and hashes to have leaked and a targeted attack (or maybe they didn't salt, then a bulk-attack is possible or use of rainbow tables)
So either one of the devices I used for imap has some malware or someone gained access to the gmx pw hash list or someone man-in-the-middled me (using STARTLS on the imap connections, so that seems unlikely to me)

Ok, I see what you mean now. I thought initially you were talking about the hosts RAM.

Let me paraphrase in bulletpoints what you listed:
 * (bad) actors weeded out
 * undamaged network/system security
 * media attention
 * fresh blood.
you might be up to something...
In November 2012 I made a similar [call (of the early 2013 rocket)]( which listed similar preconditions:
 * media coverage
 * fresh blood
 * long consolidation period
 * Bitcoin fundamentally rocksolid
what I *didn't* list but you have in your list:
 * bad actors weeded out (one could count pirateat40)
 * sentiment is in the dumps (it wasn't high at the time, though)
what I *did* list but you didn't:
 
 * reward halfing immanent
 * Ongoing and increasing distrust of fiat money and banking system amongst the general population
close enough?
I think it's still too early to call it. We need more consolidation, maybe even lower prices, but not sure. We might trend up slowly (or go sideways) for a couple of months before ignition. Mark me surprised if the rocket takes off in April.

Entering passphrase to restore to a fresh device works simlarly: the device asks you enter the words in a certain order plus also asks you to enter some random words from the dictionary. So for example to restore a 12 word seed it would ask you sequentially to:
 * enter word 
 * enter "computer"
 * enter word 
 * enter word 
 * enter "wood"
 * enter "chopper"
 * enter word 
 * ...
 * and so on
Of course you enter the words on the host computer because on the trezor itself it would be a horrible experience to enter text (2 buttons). So the attacker on the host only learns a list of words. He doesn't know the order and he doesn't know which subset of the words are actually part of the seed sentence. So he has at least factorial(12) and then some possibilities if he wants to bruteforce. Bruteforcing is also very expensive because it involves HD tree calculations and blockchain UTXO lookups.

As Amir noted on Keiser Reprot recently, **bitcoin is actually not a good payment system**: it's not instant, the fees are not generally low, and there are no consumer protections like chargebacks. Those things have to be put on top somehow.
Many downplay the fact that **Bitcoin is an awesome money**. They go on about low transaction fees and the potential of the blockchain technology and argue against the store-of-wealth use-case using the volatility and liquidity arguments. I think I understand why: they don't want to instill fear and I'm ok with that: keep it undercover for a while, sneak it in as a payment system.

;tldr: multibit, schildbach, armory, maybe blockchain.info
a bitcoinj implementation is in the works (or done, not sure) (thanks Mike Hearn), so anything based on that will not be too hard to implement trezor support for. Multibit will likely be one of the first. I think we can also expect support in Andreas Schildbachs android wallet (will need USB OTG, of course). Armory will support trezor, too. I wouldn't be surprised if blockchain.info would also join the party.
A prerequisite to support trezor is support for BIP-32 HD wallets. For some reason this is coming quite slowly and a reason for that could be that account management in BIP-32 hierarchy can be done in a number of different ways. Slush said there's currently an effort underway to standardize that (forgot the BIP ID), so eventually we can expect most wallets to support trezor.

Gold derivatives (substitutes) make a lot of sense, because gold has divisibility, recognizability and portability problems.
This is not the case with Bitcoin, so it remains to be seen what kinds of derivatives can make sense.
I would state that options are a good idea, but it's hard to establish them directly on BTC itself (although it's being done and has been for a while (mpex)). It's easier to build them on top of a bitcoin ETF like the one the Winklevii are trying to get established.

What is *'price manipulation'*?
manipulation literaly means 'change'. Any action in the market directly or indirectly *manipulates* the price
 * filling an existing order by issuing a buy / sell
 * putting an ask / bid order into the book
there are also many actions outside the market that change the price indirectly because they influence others to do one of the above:
 * talk to people
 * issue a press release

So what are we looking for if we're talking about that 'bad kind of manipulation'?
I think maybe we're looking for things like:
 * spreading false information
 * falsifying the order book with unfunded orders
 * buying / selling assets you don't even own (naked trading)
So what we're looking at here is actually misuse of power?
 * journalist misuses the trust put into him and/or the publishing environment he has access to
 * exchange owner/coder misuses its power to manipulate data on his platform
Is that what 'price manipulation' is about?

This depends what you mean by "traditional banking". 
If you mean the function of providing loans and allowing people to save money (savings &amp; loan), I would say yes: this service can and will be provided using Bitcoins.
If on the other hand you mean the banking cartel, then no: they will not adapt. And yes: they will be extinct because the basis for their existence is fiat money and credit creation.

The bear market got to you. Don't worry, this is normal.
I'm not going to post any rational thoughts about bitcoins future as you requested. Instead I want to suggest you go back to the beginnings and try to remember why you got into bitcoin in the first place. If whatever got you into it is still applicable today, you should feel comfortable staying "in the game". If on the other hand you got in for a quick buck (which I assume isn't the case), you should probably let it be and "cash out" to fiat.
For myself the reasons I fell in love with Bitcoin still exist and are valid. Hint: it's not the prospect of saving 3% in transactions fees in exchange for no chargeback protection when shopping online.
In fact let me tell you what it is: it's the prospect of making the world a better place. For me, Bitcoin is about freedom, about taking back control.
It feels good to be able to give $1000 worth of bitcoin to the darkwallet project, it feels good to be able to give $100 worth of bitcoin to wikileaks and it feels good to be able to give a portuguese coffee worth of bitcoin to a stranger on reddit who made me laugh... and it feels good for a reason: because noone takes an unreasonable cut and noone can stop me from doing it... and that's the way it should be. Money isn't the property of the state or the corporatocracy, it belongs to the people.
Bitcoin is empowering people and yes: it's a defensive 'weapon' people can use against oppression by states and/or corporations. Just like the internet, tor, encryption and so on.
If that isn't "real life significance", I don't know what is.

yes: legal tender laws and having to pay taxes is something fiat has going for it. Not much else, though.
And to be honest: when faced with having to pay your taxes in fiat you now have two choices:
 * pay your taxes in fiat
 * do not pay your taxes
maybe governments will at some point accept this private money as tax payment and offer a 3rd option:
* pay your taxes in private money
Iceland has done this during a currency crisis. People used private IOUs as money and the government even accepted these for tax payment... because they could actually buy shit with it and it was therefore useful.
Now you might say: "nah, that will never happen." But I think that's an assumption that might not hold forever and I appeal to peoples imagination and their ability to see further into the past than their own little lifespans.

I think we're already seeing some miners drop out, btw. If you look at the graphs on bitcoin.sipa.be, you can see that the 3 day growth estimate has actually fallen into the negative for about a week now.
I know: there's a lot of noise in that graph, but I think we're starting to see consolodation in the mining market.
A falling price has 2 effects on the supply by miners. The first one is:
* more coins come to market with dropping price, because more have to be sold by miners to settle their fiat costs =&gt; even more downward pressure
there is a bound to this, of course. Miners can't sell more than 100% of the mined coins. Therefore, at some point the second effect takes over
* more inefficient miners drop out of the game and resort to buying BTC instead of mining. This increases overall mining efficiency, less coins are sold into the market =&gt; downward pressure is decreased
add to this another effect of a falling price (increased demand, mainly) and you will see that at some point, the tides will turn and BTC will go up again.
It's hard to pick that bottom. Is it above $266 or below? Maybe even below $100?
I personally think we'll find the bottom around somewhere between $266 and $300.
Kudos to those who have the balls to buy at that point.

I agree that a lot of hashrate is probably in Chinese hands, but owning most of the hashrate doesn't equal owning most of the coins, so this is not evidence for your claim.
I think most (&gt;50%) of the coins are still in the hands of early adopters who tend to be from North America/Europe/Russia. Another big chunk is probably owned by people who got in when the first real wave of trading started in 2011. The Chinese didn't participate there in a meaningful way. These are unfounded claim as well, but I think it's more likely to be true than your claim.
@_date: 2014-09-07 19:38:24


definitely. At least if crypto had been in use instead of USDEURYEN... There wouldn't have been "easy credit" because there would have been no boundless "credit creation" by the banks. Loans would have had to be financed by the savings of other people.


We should put guns to peoples heads to make them spend on credit! In fact we should just bomb random places: increases demand for weapons and infrastructure rebuilding! 
Demand being weak means people save more and reduce immediate spending. It's a signal the market should react to by increasing efficiency, downsizing current production and focusing on innovation.

maybe in the short-term.
In the long run, it's surely helping the value. Without utility as money, there's no value in Bitcoin. Purely store-of-wealth is hard to believe for me.
Also: maybe we shouldn't fixate on the value so much. I can understand... it's the greed and fear and all the emotions attached, but what's really important is that we actually *use* Bitcoin, even if it's spending it at a bitpay-based merchant.

might not be *the* reason, but consider the effect that miners have to sell amounts of BTC to cover their costs (power, housing,...). The amount they have to sell increases when the price decreases, of course.

I agree it is ridiculous, people should just be allowed to barter tax-free in my mind. Of course this opens doors the tax authorities would like to keep closed.
In effect you'll always have to keep a stash of coins at least one year old to circumnavigate the income tax on BTC&lt;-&gt;goods transactions you make. The effect of this should actually be a much-reduced amount of bitcoin available for trading due to the "forced" holding period. Maybe this "artificial scarcification" indeed *does* have a positive effect on BTC price ;-).

Some here seem to think ethereum is some sort of alt-coin. It's not.
It's a platform for distributed applications. It uses a "contract" as it's main building block. With ethereum contracts you can for example...
* Create a Currency and issue Shares
* Financial Instruments and Derivatives
* Contracts, Law and Escrow
* Decentralized Organizations (DAOs)
* Decentralized Voting
* Decentralized Data Storage
(examples taken from ethereum.org website)
Be careful, though: even great success of ethereum as a platform doesn't mean ETH will be valuable. Afaik ether is continually inflating, too (same absolute amount each year, so ever-decreasing in relative terms)
Essentially you give them coins to fund further development. As kind-of a perk, you get some ETH so you can run your contracts.

This is debatable. I would argue that greed can be good for peoples welfare given the right environment.


The problem I see with this is that "good regulation" (in your sense) is seldomly achieved. Regulation is often used to favor protectionism and monopolies ("regulatory capture"). Democracy seems to fail here in my mind, at least in the form we have it in the west currently.
What exactly should good regulation aim to achieve in your mind? Is that goal being achieved by the centralized system(s) we currently have?
Maybe it's not regulation in and of itself that is harmful, but the centralized way in which it is being conceived and implemented.

If all miners colluded to only mine at 50% of their power, they would collectively save a lot on energy cost. Especially if they operate at marginal cost, this could increase their profit substantially.

@_date: 2014-05-16 18:53:47


Doesn't look like that's the case (unless they faked the screen-video). I checked the numbers in the video. Nowhere is a spread displayed (or a different exchange rate for buy/sell) and the conversion always takes place at the exchange rate that was displayed on the main page when it was last visible.
* At first he deposits $200 through his credit card. Right before the exchange rate is displayed as "1 BTC = $447.12". That works out to 200 USD / 447.29 BTC/USD = 0.44713 BTC which is exactly what is credited to his account (balance is now the 0.0223 he had before plus the new 0.4471 ~= 0.4695.
* When he buys the socks no conversion takes place and the BTC 0.0526 are sent to bitpay and correctly subtracted from his balance ( 0.4695 - 0.0526 = 0.4169)
* When he cashes out $100 the displayed exchange rate is "1 BTC = $449.23". BTC 0.2226 are subtraced from his balance. That works out to 100 USD / 0.2226 BTC = 449.23 USD/BTC, the displayed exchange rate.
I don't think they're even using a spread but giving the same rate for selling/buying. If this is indeed the case: kudos to them on that point (0% fees), that's really awesome.

I know it's too late now, but trust me, there will likely be another debacle like mybitcoin, bitcoinica, weexchange, mtgox and countless others.
**If you don't exclusively control the private key, you don't own the bitcoin.**
It's time to expect any service that holds your money to offer some scheme to protect it (from itself and 4th parties).
**If the service really must hold your money, it should protect it as best as it can**: m of n transactions offer a solution, for example. (see Neo/Bees scheme).
If that scheme cannot be used (would be hard for an exchange because the user could block payment to the buyer), the entity **should at least offer proof that it actually holds the funds** to their customers by publishing and proving the follwing:
* the amount of customer funds that are held (proof of ownership via signature on key(s) that hold the funds)
* the amount of customer funds that are owed (proof by "blind solvency proof" developed by gmaxwell. [Here's a implementation by olalonde](
I'm looking forward to see services compete on transparency and customer fund safety.
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:08:54

The IBLT can be managed in an ongoing fashion, no?
* When new tx comes in, run it through the policy filter and if it goes through, add it to my "current IBLT".
* After a block is verified, remove all the contained transactions from my "current IBLT" (this can maybe be done quite efficiently by simply subtracting the IBLT that came with the block.)
That way I have a continuously updated IBLT.
Only caveat are the parameters, like "size of high-priority space", but I think that could be solved, too. For example by chunking multiple IBLTs.

That's not true. Other miners will mine the 10K block, too. They have no other choice. They might "know of a forthcoming solution", but they can't use it. What do you expect them to do? Stop mining until the "winning block" has arrived in full?
You simply can't mine on the big block until it's received, because you don't know which transactions it includes. Therefore you would most likely include transactions into your new block that have already 1 confirmation. You will then have successfully mined an invalid block on that "winning block".
The "winning block" is in fact more likely to be orphaned, because **noone can mine on that big block until it's fully received and everyone mines on the 10k block**.

wrong. the miners decide this. why? because a block is orphaned (by definition) when a sibling branch is extended. Extension is done by miners. Hence miners orphan blocks.

Honestly, I think this is it. The bottom is in.
That's what *I think*. So beware... I often think wrong.
If it goes below $266 (the old ATH), all bets are off and we'll probably go much lower. But I don't think that will happen.
A bottom of $330 (down from $1160, previous ATH: $266) fits pretty well comparing to the April bubble pop: That went from $266 to ~$50, the previous ATH being $32. 
However, that analogy has a key difference: This current potential "turnaround-low" of $330 is below the low reached right after the bubble popped (only $385). With the April bubble, the turnaround-low was above the crash-low ($60 &gt; $40).
Don't know how accurately history repeats itself.

The problem is: you can't mine on the block until you've received and verified it in full.
If I receive a 10K block while the 1 Gig monster downloads, I will mine on that 10k block, just because I can.
There's no way to mine on the 1 Gig block because I don't know which transactions to include in my new block.

In that "thinking", I wouldn't say value isn't *realized*, it's **created**. The 19% would be on the price of the bitcoins (the price the miners sells them for). He could of course deduct the VAT he payed on expenses.
Of course this was of thinking (a miner creates value) is quite misguided. One could argue that VAT could be payed on transaction fees, but not mining reward, imo. The miner didn't create the bitcoin. He found it.

Good question. I could imagine it could go down like this:
* new consensus algo is implemented in some altcoin, let's call it NCA for "new consensus algorithm"
* assuming it's really good people will flock to that altcoin (sell BTC for NCA)
* however: as with most altcoins, probably the distribution is such that a lot of BTC holders and maybe also newcomers have reservations
* there might be discussion about hard-forking bitcoin to switch to the the algorithm. Consensus will not be reached.
* there might be a fork done anyways. People who held BTC before, now have BTC and BTCNCA. For this reason, the fork might have better chances to gain acceptance than NCA itself. There's still a shift of wealth towards the early believers (and risk-takers) as should be, just not as extreme as with NCA.
* If the movement to shift to BTCNCA is strong enough, it will gain value versus BTC. Key, though is merchant/user adoption. 
I'm not sure how likely such a scenario is, but it's certainly thinkable. It's also thinkable NCA will just win. It's also thinkable BTC will win (after all, BTC inflation *does* decrease and sometime in 2016 the pain will be cut in half already). It might also be the case that such an alternative algorithm is extremely hard to find.

The wikipedia article is more balanced than you make it look:
Pro free market economists claim the following advantages for **free movement of capital:**
 
* It enhances overall economic growth by allowing savings to be channelled to their most productive use.[28]
 
* By encouraging foreign direct investment it helps developing economies to benefit from foreign expertise.[28]
 
* Allows states to raise funds from external markets to help them mitigate a temporary recession.[28]
 
* Enables both savers and borrowers to secure the best available market rate.[12]
 
* When controls include taxes, funds raised are sometimes siphoned off by corrupt government officials for their personal use.[12]
 
* Hawala-type traders across Asia have always been able to evade currency movement controls
 
* Computer and communications technologies have made unimpeded electronic funds transfer a convenience for increasing numbers of bank customers.

Probably most bitcoin-paying customers are new customers to overstock, so you're number (4.3%) is likely correct.
However you're neglecting the possibility that these people would've made the purchase in fiat if bitcoin hadn't been available as a payment option, so logically, 4.3% is more of an upper bound.

I would bet that the addresses the dust is sent to are addresses which appeared on the blockchain before as inputs to transactions, i.e. with a signature.
People might still be trying to exploit old android wallet with the low-entropy RNG bug: If RNG has low entropy, one can calculate the private key if one has access to 2 valid signatures with that key. 
This would be the case once the user spends the dust.
There might be better explanations, but here is one:

yeah, that's true. Thinking about the money part can also trigger fear. So they move away from that idea. It's just too big for some, the implied societal change too fundamental. The implications are mind-boggling and very political. Most of the people in that space are used to cozying up to regulators, because they have to. Bitcoin doesn't have to.


One needs to understand how the distributed ledger and consensus-finding works. While it's not very technical, it requires some thinking about the incentive structure and such. I doubt many have thought through how bitcoin works. (example: "I think you need 6 repetitions to make sure the transaction really happened. I think thats prone to be exploited")

and money laundering
It's quite clear what he's getting at: the *technology* is key (note his accentuation of the word 'technology'), but we can't use Bitcoin itself because it's infested with these bad actors. In fact I think his problem is that *other* people own the majority of Bitcoins and he got in too late (or not at all). So he's trying to argue we need to use the 'blockchain technology' and build a 'legitimate', 'attributable' money with it. One that enables a certain level of governmental/corporate control.
My opinion on this is: well, go for it. Have the IMF or whoever create a blockchain and let there be competition!

If it's an android phone, you can do

or directly from your PC with active debugging usb connection to phone:
     adb shell wm density 380
of course 380 would be replaced by your preferred "fake" screen dpi setting. If you set it lower than the pyhsical pixel density of your device (it's in pixels per inches), everything will be smaller. All fonts, icons, everything. For the homescreen to adjust you can reboot.

I don't think this is true. Larger blocks have orphan risk cost associated due to higher propagation time.
In that light (there is a cost to mining large blocks) it wouldn't be necessary in a no-limit system for miners to reject blocks they deem too large. I suspect the disincentive I mentioned (and maybe other disincentives) would be sufficient to throttle blockchain size.

I agree. However, it could motivate some people to move permanently or just use overstock more often. Could be 0.5 to 1.0% new business for them in the end. 
Still a big deal.
Also: the cost savings due to lower tx cost and no chargebacks.
I hope they treat customers well enough. Otherwise it might turn out a bad idea for the customer to pay in bitcoin. It's easy to reverse a paypal payment, not so easy to reverse overstock.

It's even older. It was already old news when that "Welt" article was published.
By the way: "bitcoin is tax free for private use" is wrong. When you sell BTC (or buy stuff with BTC, which amount to a Bitcoin sale), you have to pay income tax on the gain. Only exception: if you held the Bitcoin you sold for more than 1 year, the gain (or loss) is tax-free.

I'm not sure why this got downvoted, it makes a lot of sense to me.
Money is also a communication medium. Price signals are sent all over the globe.
Shit starts going wrong when price signals are distorted by people who think the money supply needs 'management'. Well, they actually don't think that but that's how they argue. What they think is: me and my friends need more money. This results in capital misallocations and distorted unreliable price signals. It confuses the world and results in the people doing inefficient uneccessary things.
Use of sound money (money with an inelastic supply that can't be 'managed') should fix that problem and make us more prosperous in sum and easier for the planet to digest.

technically yes. But they'd share the same past, the same "initial distribution". Classical altcoins don't do that. They somehow make a new distribution, usually to enrich the founders and early adopter of that altcoin.
By your logic, every commit to the core repo that makes forking changes creates a new altcoin. So what we love now as Bitcoin already is an altcoin because p2sh was introduced and also leveldb.

@_date: 2017-02-08 08:10:40
I know Bitcoin "doesn't scale". In the complexity theory sense, if n is the number of users and you're looking at the aggregate resource use and you're assuming "one user one node", then the resource use scales quadratically in n. As anyone who studied this even just roughly knows: fiddling with a constant (for example blocksize) wont help. This is why "bigger blocks" are not a "scaling solution" in this sense.
Yes, there *might* be real scaling solutions, like sharding, using acyclic directed graphs instead of a chain, subchains, treechains or whatever. I personally don't know wether any of these fulfill their promise and if so, at what cost, but I wouldn't rule out some altcoin alleviating scaling issues to a large enough extent to be able to serve everyone on-chain.
The layering solution, especially when done in a largely trustless manner (like LN under the assumption of *enough* on-chain capacity) is not "on-chain scaling" either, but that doesn't matter as long as the features of bitcoin are retained.
Please understand my fear that a limit on the blocksize (even if it's *just* on the settlement layer) that is too low, will harm Bitcoin in many ways: the mempool always being filled with a lot of transactions might be desirable from a mining incentive view, but it causes numerous problems regarding usability. LN security guarantees assume the possibility to settle to the chain in a timely fashion. With too low of a blocksize limit, the security of many LN users is being degraded.
"One user one node" is not the configuration Satoshi envisioned for a larger scale bitcoin network, so I really don't see why we can't remove the blocksize limit and *still* develop and use layer 2 solutions. Capacity will hit some non-artificial limit at some point. Why not let bitcoin grow on-chain for a while to make it stronger? Why choke it here and now? I really don't understand the insistence on the 1 MB limit. We *have* a lot more resources available to support bigger blocks.
tldr: bitcoin doesn't "scale", let's fiddle with a constant anyway to increase capacity and make bitcoin stronger.

supply-side: That depends how many they sold. If they had half a million USD development and other cost, $120 sounds reasonable if they sell 5000 pcs.
demand-side: depends on the customer. I payed 3 BTC (about $300 at the time) for my trezor and I would've payed 10 BTC ($1000) at the time.
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:33:48
Exactly. Even barter is usually taxed as reciprocal sale at market value in tax currency. So when, for example, you buy a Pizza for BTC, you might have to pay some tax for *selling* those BTC. For example income tax in germany or capital gains tax in the states.

Also note: there is a peculiarity I made use of in my accounting. May be specific to germany: When transferring coins between "depots", the coins can be freely choosen at will (!!). At least my tax advisor said so and of course this opens up huge optimization potential, especially in conjuction with the 1 year limit: when moving coins to an exchange for selling, one can select "old coins" (bought more than one year ago) if available. If no old coins are available, one can use ones with a high cost basis.
But even without freely selecting coins when transferring (using FIFO for example) there can be very large reduction (depending on the case, of course) of tax burden compared to a "whole-sale" approach that doesn't use separate depots.

To summarize that video: Patrick shows that for the p2p network block propagation latency increases with block size. I fail to see the relevance of that for what we're discussing here (namely mining centralization). 
When presented with solutions for this, take the recent "thin blocks" case as an example, some people react by telling us that this has never been a problem because of bluematts relay network anybody could join. And they are correct.
We're not going to improve mining decentralization substantially at the network layer because that's not where the problem originates from. We'd need to look at the PoW algorithm instead.

Haven't looked at trezor for android.
I'm sorry if I gave the impression that this was possible at this time for a user. What I linked is 'just' a library that helps wallet developers integrate trezor into their wallets. Ask your android wallet developer about trezor integration. Donations can greatly motivate people, too.
to my knowledge there is no android wallet at this time supporting the trezor.
A prerequisite for a wallet to support trezor is BIP32 (hd wallet) support. Mycelium has it, and I think bitcoinj (the lib used in Andreas Schildbachs Bitcoin wallet) has it, too.

I don't like this scheme since the store get's to know who I am (enter personal identifier on store register).
I'd like to see a privacy-preserving way to pay.
Seems easily possible with a bitcoin wallet. However: the wallet/phone would have to authenticate the store, otherwise payment request could be spoofed.
Actually now that I think about it: I do like the qr-code method. What would be an awesome addition would be the wallet app recording a little video when I scan the payment address of the store. That way I have quite good proof the address I payed to was actually the one shown by the store for payment.

Rate of monetary inflation is cut in half and you think that has no effect?!? It's evident it "changes something".


You mean the last time block reward was halved? What are you looking at? Last halving was Q4 2012 (late November '12). Now zoom out a little and look what happened in Q1 2013 (starting early January more specifically): price went from $15 to $266!! The rally really started to catch steam roughly 5 weeks after the halfing. Are you going to tell me that's unrelated and it was "just the media hype around cyprus" or some other story? No, it's the effect of the supply stream being cut in half and demand remaining essentially the same.

not sure what these people (including Gates) mean by "digital currency". But clearly Bitcoin is not just about moving money, but about reinventing money itself: a new kind of *money*, not just a new kind of payment system using some old kind of money.
To me it sounds like the old guard is trying to take steam from this monetary revolution by diverting it into a payment system revolution, which allows them to keep their monetary powers.

I read a lot of ridicule in this thread. I think that's an unfair  reaction and totally unecessary. 
After all the comment just asks a question (basically: how does mining work). It doesn't make any accusation, it's just wondering and expressing confusion.
The reaction should be to gently try to explain things, not from the top down, of course. That's how to grow the community, not by laughing at people and being hostile.

Separate wallets is what I did to reduce my tax burden here in germany where it's been rather clear for a while that bitcoin gains will be handled in this way (gains from selling private property). It works well to protect my "private stash" at home from realizing gains through daytrading another set of coins on an exchange... after all, you can only sell those coins that are in the exchanges wallet/depot. Therefor you select the base cost (buying price) from one of the coins in that depot (using FIFO on the set of coins inside it).
There seems to be one big differences regarding taxation scheme between the US and germany: In germany, after holding on to some bitcoin for 1 year, the selling is tax-free.

This was pre-internet. People used modems to connect to BBSes (Bulletin Board Services) running on remote computers. It was simply point-2-point, not packet-switched. There they could access software repositories, news, etc. (all locally stored on that particular BBS) or chat with the sysop.
There was also no relaying of messages between BBSes at first. If you listened carefully you will know that you could only send messages to other micronet users. Later those got interconnected through networks like [fidonet]( to relay email. That was not packet-switched, either. Nodes (or points) would connect to their upstream peers in a tree structure at certain pre-scheduled times of day to exchange messages. Those would flow up the tree-like structure (each level being assigned an hour of the night) and back down again to reach the destination. Usually it would take 2-3 days for an email to get delivered.

* 1.) there is a mem pool. Tx demand (spam or not) being 100% of capacity does *not* "kill" the system at all
* 2.) spamming is essentially free as long as the spam transactions don't get mined. The attacker doesn't pay a fee to broadcast his tx and put it into everyones mempool. With a larger block size limit, miners would at least have the options to mine those spam transactions and thus **make the attacker actually pay the fee**

Not all merchants pass it on. Recently saw 2% charged on bitcoin payment (same as CC and paypal). Fuck them, I thought, and used paypal ;)
Actually I personally think the capped, predetermined supply combined with the empowering users with controlling their money is bitcoins greatest feature. It's not easy to market, but it's what got me hooked, to be honest.
Honestly I think the fees are primarily a selling point for merchants, not consumers... even when passed on to consumers. Lack of chargeback actually makes bitcoin a bad payment method for customers.

That's extremely risky. If you do this in your tree in large-scale you're basically betting that none of the "known inactive" users will ever check. Even a single one of them checking and finding a negative-valued subtree will blow up your whole scheme. The probability of that increases dramatically with the amount of "known inactive" users you use. 
So there are limits and there's always risk.

Yes, it affects the sizes of pretty much everything. All the layout adjusts nicely, though. The phone just thinks your display is physically larger than it really is and so it scales everything down.
@_date: 2016-03-04 18:03:08


no we're not
I think one should take a **more differentiated look at the mempool** than just the number of transactions: it makes sense to bin them by fee (**histogram over fees**), as done on  ([screenshot](
(I'd love to see that data charted over time, btw)
And no: we're not back to normal: notice that an unusually high fee is necessary to get into the next block: **there are currently 4,761 transactions (more than 2 blocks worth) that pay 131 satoshi per byte or more** (about BTC 0.0003 for a "standard" tx)
Compare that with a [screenshot of same page I took 2/29]( (overall count was 30,000 tx at the time): **there were only 669 transactions paying an even lower fee of 61 satoshi/byte or more (only 327 tx in the 131+ bin)**
What are these numbers saying: yes, the spam attack (very low fee transactions, &lt;20 sat/byte) is over, but **now *real* transactions paying a relatively high fee (131 sat/byte is about 0.0003 BTC (!) for a "standard" transaction)**
@_date: 2016-03-04 18:21:05
currently, even if you attach a BTC 0.0003 fee (for a 229 byte standard tx), you won't get into the next block. Look: 
No amount of people-paying-higher-fees-than-other-people (soon enough, "reasonable fee" might be BTC 0.03) will make the transactions fit into the blocks of limited size. People *will* go elsewhere. They *have* to. Price will drop, altcoins will blossom. I really hate that future, but some people just have to run that "fee market experiment" to push their layer 2 product demand.
The problem isn't the spam attacks, the problem is that real demand is higher than capacity.

I too would be happy to stand in the shaming-corner with the stupid-hat on, all happy about the "one true blockchain" having been protected by the core devs.

@_date: 2016-03-04 18:47:22
Probably just people "making sure" their tx goes through by entering 0.0003 BTC fee manually?
Note: if overall demand is higher than capacity and people refuse to use "other options", this is going to escalate fees to much higher levels.
I think some people might have a rude awakening to what this "fee market" really means/is.

it's just a hunch, but models based on stuff like that might be the reason why the financial system is blowing up. When I read stuff like "independent random variables", the [ludic fallacy]( (also from that book) comes to mind.

@_date: 2015-05-10 07:33:24
*somewhat slower*?
I'm not sure. If mem-pool fills up with transactions permanently (sustained tx load exceeds 1MB/block), users will just have their funds permanently "stuck in the wallet". There will be fee wars. Bitcoin will be "expensive and broken", people will flock to alts.
So no, by "screwed" I mean people flee to alts and/or off-chain. Both I don't want to see at this point.

Stop bending the truth like that and making stuff up to suit your agenda.

In contrast to the hard block size limit, this is something we don't have to take care of a long time in advance.

That's why DNMs should not use hotwallets (how did coinbase know the tx was to the DNM). Instead, the payment for a purchase should go into a multisig escrow and from there directly to the seller.

I have to say jitsi sucks. It doesn't cooperate well with my window manager and the fonts look shitty. It's apparently also not easy enough to use for my windows friends, either.
Also one big drawback I found in pretty much all xmpp clients is the inability to send deferred messages. With skype one could always do that.
I also have great problems using group chat (conferences) with various jabber clients.
Another thing with xmpp: security is not the default, you have to tell people to install OTR plugins, which are sometimes incompatible and you often have problems with un-decryptable messages, which results in people falling back to cleartext.
I'm not going to push some tech onto my friends if it means I have to phone-support them for half an hour before we can chat. It should just work.
I'm hoping tox solves these issues and is easy to use.

As long as I have the option to settle to the chain for a reasonable price within a reasonable timeframe, I personally might use LN for some transactions. Still: it's a layer on top of Bitcoin and adds additional risk, so it's not as simple as you put it.

no, but bandwidth shouldn't be used as an argument for keeping the 1MB limit. Incidentally it's not used so prevalently any more since segwit is "the way to go" (since segwit doesn't do anything to reduce bandwidth requirements).
EDIT: I just had to think of that "little story" when Lee argued that a node needed *more than just 1MB per 10 minues* of bandwidth in case it was switched off for 10 hlours or on initial sync because it needed to "catch up". Yes, I thought, *more than 0.0144 mbit*. Scary stuff.

Not an expert on this, but I greatly appreciate development and testing of different PoW strategies and I salute you for your work in Myriadcoin.
I'm eager to have something that will result in higher mining decentralization (put power back into the hands of the people). Currently I fear it would be a continuous race. I'm unsure wether the pure threat of a switch would effectively deter asic development. I guess the threat would have to be credible. The plan could be to swap out one of four algorithms every year, for example?

It's worth more because of the collectors value this coin has. It's a 2012 series 2 1 BTC casacius coin. Guessing it would go for around 1.5 BTC depending on condition. Since it's been laying around in rubble touching air and whatnot, it might be tarnished / scratched quite a bit. So maybe less than 1.5.
During a bitcoin hype you could probably sell it on ebay for 2 to 3 times the monetary value. People go crazy on ebay, I've seen it in 2013.

They *technically* signal segwit readyness, yes. But you can't deduce that the users running those nodes somehow want segwit to be activated. This is just an attempt to try fool the miners into thinking the userbase demands segwit. 
Even if node "signaling" *was* an accurate way to measure feature support, how would you account for the 95,000 (number pulled out of my ass, but argument still stands) bitcoin users that don't run a node?

Not necessarily fear of a hard fork. I've been divesting from bitcoin into alts (turns out too slowly, though) for fear of Bitcoin keeping on stalling at low capacity.
The "bigblockers" have been saying this since 2015 at least: the tx demand will go to altcoins and so will the value. Do you *still* not believe it with the evidence starting you in the eye? Obviously no, you have to attribute it to "HF fears". It's simply market dynamics: bitcoin cannot satisfy the transaction demand (below a cerain fee), so demand goes elsewhere and the value follows.

A money needs to be useful for both "transfer of value" *and* "store of value". Without the utility of first one (which is directly influenced by the amount of people using the money) there would be no value to store. That utility alone is not a sufficient condition for value, but a necessary one. You still need a certain rarity, which the rupee is probably lacking.


If noone uses the money, there is no value (only some 'intrinsic' value for non-monetary uses, which in the case of bitcoin is very low). The more people use it, the more valuable it is. Just because other factors (like management policy or governance for example) also influence that value doesn't mean the amount of people using it doesn't.

Of course it was an example. I wanted to show 2 things by quoting the number.
 * Satoshi never wanted blocks to hit that size limit. When he said it could be phased out, block 115000 was 5 months into the future, block were never going to reach capacity within that time (block 115000 had 5 transactions, rather typical for the time)
 * This block size was put in a loooong time ago so almost noone was there when it was put in. Most people weren't made aware of it when Bitcoin was explained to them. Guess why? Because it wasn't really part of the deal.

The economic majority *does* define bitcoin, but not by "the software they run", but through the miners.
How do you propose to defend against sybil attacks regarding the "software people run"? How is this supposed to work? The initial idea was "one cpu one vote" (failed due to asics), now we have a miner cartel who will, driven by their own selfish interest, enforce the rules the economic majority (supposedly) wants. This is not ideal, either.
say it's invalid
Yes, a single node can reject the longest chain as invalid (say because it cointains a 1.1 MB block) and a large enough group of nodes can split themselves from the longest chain this way if they want. This splits them from the longest chain. Those nodes will have to see about how they organize their mining on that weaker chain, but they're free to do it if they don't agree with the mining majority.
Of course the miners will try to prevent such a split, but they will also try to prevent the "economic majority" migrating off to other cryptos.
@_date: 2016-03-14 21:31:11
Thanks for you explanations, that cleared some things up for me.
One thing I don't quite understand: In a chained setup like x11, if one hash gets compromised (in what way? I don't see how a preimage attack would help). How exactly does that lucky guy exploit that? I don't get the mechanics of that.
EDIT: an another question: do you thing the path CPU -&gt; GPU -&gt; ASIC is inevitable and/or a good thing? Do you think current sha256d landscape will decentralize again when asics have arrived at the cutting edge of what chip fabs can do like Antonopulous recently stated?

@_date: 2017-03-26 08:05:29
Something like this has yet to be found. It would be awesome: one cpu, one vote.
Unfortunately *until* one such algorithm is found and proven, we'll have to make do with the current situation: somewhat centralized mining industry is tasked with distilling community (or economic) opinion and mine accordingly to keep the tokens they mine valuable.
Currently in Bitcoin they seem to be failing: bitcoin dominance took a hefty hit.

Hey jron. Nice to see an oldtimer remember me ;-) Those were the good times.
I still have skin in the game although I sold a bunch for fiat (to buy thing) and also diversified into some altcoins because of bitcoins capacity problems and the bleak outlook regarding a solution.
I'm pushing for bigger blocks because I came to the conclusion that it's the right thing to do and I feel obliged to act my conscience and also because I want to protect the value I got my hands on.
I acknowledge and respect opinions of people who come to other conclusions, but I am also alert as to potential attacks of various kinds. I thought through some attacks that could be done by the "old money establishment" and some scenarios I looked at are almost indiscernable from what's happening currently.
Bitcoin is going through a really rough patch (wether this is an attack or not). It's hurt, on the floor and the bleeding increases in volume. Like in any good action movie, I believe our hero will fight through and shine in the end. That's why I would never divest all my BTC and in case of a split I would only sell 50 to 75 percent of the smallblock chain.

pretty similar to my own story. Albeit I sold my half over a long period of time and not at once (starting late 2015, when it became clear to me that the blocksize debate was not going to be over soon). One part of me always felt bad after each sale when the price kept creeping up higher. Another part felt the calm of having taken some risk off the table and knew it was the right decision at the time.

my personal estimation is that they bought the 1% they said they had bought in 2012. So 210,000 BTC.

1.) there's clearly a tradeoff between ease-of-use and security here (shift-alt-f, klick button on trezor is pretty damn slick.)
2.) compared to *other* pw managers that work with a browser extension/addon (like lastpass and others), trezor pw manager is much better because even a malicious extension could only siphon off the passwords you actually use while it's active, not the whole db at once.
3.) your locally running pw manager also offers some attack surface (your OS) and malware at that point compromises your whole db. In that scenario, trezor pw manager will minimize damage, even compared to your favored solution.

Any improvements on electricity consumption will be eaten by difficulty adjustments. In fact in a competitive mining market, the mining cost will tend to be close to the mining reward.
Expecting further commodification of mining hardware (that shit'll tend to get cheaper as we've now hit high-end of manufacturing capabilities), we can expect an even greater proportion of mining cost to be electricity cost.
In other words: almost all of the mining reward will be burned as electricity. That's just how PoW works.

@_date: 2016-06-04 11:44:55
No, PIN is NOT added to the seed. 
Optional passphrase is, though. (I hope they will enable that on trezor password store, btw). So maybe you mixed those up?
PIN just protects device access. It's not needed to restore from seed.

... we should still use adequate solutions for *storing* the passwords for those legacy systems.
Yes, passwords are inherently insecure, but that doesn't mean we should just give up and all use "1234" as password. Sometimes the perfect is the enemy of the good.
don't get me wrong: trezor pw store is a very good solution for this problem (storing passwords): more secure than lastpass, more comfortable (and possible more secure) than a local (native to your OS) pw store.

ok, point taken.
I just wanted to oppose fts42 telling people to "get over it" and fundamentally ruling out the use of "bit" based on his viewpoint. Sorry, that kind of language just gets my emotions stirred up a bit and maybe I overreacted.
Others have argued here well enough that the possibility of confusion is low.
The only valid opposition against using "bit" for 100 satoshis is that that is basically "inventing" a new meaning for a word and introducing an additional term into bitcoin terminology. I still think the upsides outweight this.
@_date: 2017-01-22 19:11:25
that makes no sense. A bot could just take commands from a human and then the human would have a nice workaround.
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:18:01
It took 12 hours to grow by 50k
And if you add in just 10% additional demand (due to some chinese dudes pulling coins off exchanges or whatnot), you can explain the 50k spike. I did the math (back-of-napkin) in the wall observer thread on bitcointalk. If you want, I can dig it out
So yeah, those 10% additional demand *could* be intentional spamming. But why assume that, there's more than enough possible non-malicious reasons for a 10% fluctuation.

That's a compeletely different requirement:
The paper-trail requirement makes sense: you need to prove you haven't evaded any taxes by showing your sales. You're usually assumed to be honest, but they can check you randomly or on valid suspicion. Fine (as long as you think taxes are fine)
The real-time upload of each transaction to a central databases enables a lot more: They can fishnet-surveil everyone/everything. Everyone is put under a constant generalized suspicion. Everyone can be checked (and probably will be) automatically, without valid supicion and without any noticing by the victim. The assumption that taxpayers are honest goes out the window here. Not fine (unless you think totalitarianism is fine)

So *technically* bitcoin is not used by more than roughly 5000 people trustlessly.
Maybe we should think about wether we really need a "technically trustless" system and what the other options are?
If we stubbornly hold on to the "everyone verifies eveybody elses transactions" mantra, then I don't see how we can have more than a few users and we condemn bitcoin to some niche, giving the arena to the various alternatives.

Making fun of that aside, humans have much less trouble handling whole numbers (however large, doesn't matter) and zeroes before the decimal point than fractions and zeroes after the decimal point.

@_date: 2017-01-22 21:05:08
That's not a good idea. Think about the confusion. Maybe "1 Bitcoin" is part of some contract or whatever. Also old texts (like about the 21 million bitcoin limit) would have to be changed. Anytime you read something involving any amount of "bitcoin" you would have to think about what time period it originated from.
The idea isn't just radical, it's bad.
@_date: 2016-11-08 20:58:06
state channels are a generalization of payment channels.
Instead of passing around transactions saying who owns how many coins, notes (transactions) about the state of the game are passed around.
LN uses payment channels, so maybe that's why you associated that.
I found a good explanation of state channels using a chess match as example [here](


So, like a payment channel reduces the blockspace need of many micropayments substantially (down to 1 setup and 1 settlement tx), so can a state channel reduce the blockspace requirement of playing (for money) a game of go on the blockchain (one setup tx where the players lock their money and one settlement tx revealing the final state (maybe including path) of the game and paying the winner (who knows, maybe it could easily be extended to include betting by other people) 
Of course the devil might be in the details, regarding the game of go (like how to apply timing rules and how exactly to count in the end), but those seem solvable at first thought.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:56:41


If Bitcoin can't be used for transactional purposes, there's not going to be much value to it. The "gold 2.0" idea is flawed. The fundamental value of a coin is derived from its utility, which is rooted in its payment function.
In other words: no affordable transactions -&gt; no good store of value.

Segwit is not a "compromise", it's a political package implemented the wrong way. The "other side" did not accept this "compromise" in any way.
And maybe the "real point" is something else still, but I can't carry on here without risk of getting shut up by the mods.
Segwit is a suggestion by core and it's being voted on by the miners (and community by extension) currently. We'll see how it goes. If it gets accepted, I'll swallow the pill but diversify my stash.

There's no technical reason. Mining works on a hash of parts of the block (the transactions mainly).
Bandwidth, verification load, storage space required are all affected by block size, but not the "mining process" per se. A miner mining in a pool wouldn't notice any kind of a difference, wether he mines on a 1 KB or a 1 GB block.
There (used to?) be a implementation-specific limit on the maximum size of a block in the network layer implementation of bitcoin (32 MB, I think), if that's what you've been asking for.

Everything else is a disaster waiting to happen in my mind. No matter what the legal framework is: it can be bent, overridden, worked around and whatnow. Hell, I even saw exceptions for things like war and whatnot in that prospectus. They're gonna wiggle out when push comes to shove.
I can see how institutional investors have rules they need to follow, but really we don't need these to invest. Bitcoin is the peoples money.
I see these bitcoin substitutes as dangerous decoys, diverting people from actually owning bitcoin and potentially even artificially inflating the money supply.

Rupies in a bank account are also not affected. The problem is that the indian economy runs largely on cash (many don't even *have* bank accounts, those are the "unbanked" likes to talk about), so if you want to go shopping, neither your BTC nor your INR in the bank will help.
BTC has the slight upside (compared to rupies in the bank) that it could *potentially* be transacted to the seller p2p. But that is seen as a "spam attack" and thanks to the fee market and blocksize limit fees are already too high for such low-value transactions. 
That's what happens when you think a coffee at starbucks doesn't have to be on the blockchain: an indian families food for the day can also not be on the blockchain.

If you buy a good or service with BTC, from the tax authorities point of view, it's a reciprocal sell: the merchant sells the good/service, *you* sell Bitcoins.
Of course such a transaction is not the only possible reason for a "transfer out". Could be just the user transferring the funds to his own wallet. Coinbase doesn't really (?) know, so it books it as a sell in their reporting.
If you think p2p trading goods for other goods (barter) should not be taxable, then you are not alone. But the lawmaker is not on your side here and requests that you book the transaction(s) with a fiat value attached.

Those are not simply fears. We're turning people away. How can you doubt that? I've experienced this first hand. If the transaction doesn't arrive within reasonable time a new user thinks bitcoin is broken. And he's right: it is broken for that use case!

asure how long it takes them to get confirmed.
What kind of mindset sees the users of a system as some kind of resource that can be exploited "utilizing weekly cycles". Why would you want to lock up users funds for that long? To get them used to using RBF so the fee cartel can work more smoothly? To show them how to double-spend so 0-conf can finally be killed?
@_date: 2016-12-21 07:17:40
you probably mean "roughly 1 year ago", right? (we were building a base chopping around $200 - $300 for the most part of 2015, accumulation phase of our huge cup and handle pattern)
Otherwise you'd have to mean the time period between the $266 high and the all-time-high in 2013 when "180" was sort of an anchor in the narrative. That wouldn't make much sense, because then you'd have missed the November 2013 high "not paying attention", which seems unlikely given the hype back then and the gox fall in early 2014.

It may be the only way at some point and frankly I don't think it'd be the tragedy you make it out to be.
I think forking and letting the market decide (or hell, just have 2 bitcoins indefinitely) is a viable governance option.
Look at it like a stock share split. Nobody loses anything. Now there's 42 million tokens, but everybody's balance "doubled", too. And one even gets to exchange the half of their tokens they deem less useful for the individually preferred ones.
In my mind it wasn't a disaster in ethereum, either. Not at all. What made things somewhat bad was the decision to not do anything against replay attacks when making the fork (ha! they really thought they could kill the etc chain with that, but the attempt failed. So from that we should learn), well and the DAO fuckup that made the fork "necessary" in the first place, of course.

I have a suggestion:
Don't take a profit based solely on wether or not it looks like a "nice profit" to you.
Imagine 4 quadrants:
* upper left: you hodl and price drops
* upper right: you hodl and rally continues
* lower left: you sell and price drops
* lower right: you sell and rally continues
Imagine each situation and write down how it makes you feel. Also try partial sells. Also try extreme drops (to $10) and extreme rallyes (to $10,000)
Then decide how much to sell (if you want you can include the probabilities of price movement from your crystal belly or chart magic)

This is not true. If the sourcecode is open and the wallet is popular, you can at least *hope* that people (at least some hackers, lol) are looking into it *for* you. They might not tell you the results, but opensource (even if you don't check it yourself) is a hell of a lot better than closed source. The risk alone of putting malicious code out in the open like that is probably deterring enough.

Price might be purely hype-based and based on fresh "big money" coming in. The market can be temporarily wrong.

If that's the worst case I think we're prepared.
It's the other way around: Those dudes buying stuff on leverage better prepare for Bitcoin, which has had drops of 60% to 80%, some within hours (look at the April 2013 crash)
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:02:24


That's not a "huge crash". What is that? 10%?
That's just a little correction "on the way up", a breather. Bitcoin used to have *corrections* of about 20% during bull runs. "Bubble pops" drop the price about 60 to 80%.
Can you stomach an 80% drop?
Don't get me wrong: I believe Bitcoin (or one of the forks) is going to keep increasing in price in the long run. But it's going to be very volatile, as always. There will be these crazy runups (we've just seen one) with many newbs coming in (you're one of them). They inevitable result is a bear-market that will drop the price by 50 to 80% to clear out the weak hands (sorry to say, but it seems to me that's also *you*).
Better sell (at least some) earlier, even if it's not the top (picking tops is fucking hard).
Only invest what you can afford to lose.

It's really hard for me to call Bitcoin a ponzi because that's a view I have been fighting for 6 years now. What makes it a ponzi is the removal (or strong reduction) of its utility. Without that, everyone buying in just pays off those already in (the sellers). A snowball effect based on hype.
If it *really* turns out to be a ponzi (I was stating it as fact in OP, but it's not really decided yet) it will also exhibit the most distinctive feature of a ponzi scheme: it crashes to negligible value.

Yes. The whole setup seems unecessarily risky to me compared to a plain old trezor plus seed backup solution.
On a more general note: I don't like the use of biometrics in general. It's being sold as "highly secure", but really is a way to unecessarily tie stuff to your person and it's also not secure at all. In fact it's rather easy to acquire someones fingerprint and fake it to the hardware.

CPU: central *processing* unit (does all the calculations)
SSD: solid state disk (non-volatile *memory*)
RAM: random access memory (low-latency high bandwidth volatile memory)
The CPU is the fastest part. It uses registers to hold some data it can run calculations on (like multiplication, addition and so on). It can load data from RAM into these registers and write the results back, too. The access to RAM is much slower than the CPU can calculate, so without any tricks it would starve and run idle most of the time. One of these tricks is using a fast cache between CPU and RAM (usually integrated on the same die). The downside is that this cache cannot be big. 8 MB is already rather large. Smaller CPUs have only 2 MB, bigger ones more.
Now, if your program and its data fits into the cache of the CPU, it will run blazingly fast. If the amount data the program needs to access on a regular basis is larger than what the cache can store (that's definitely the case for bitcoin), RAM will have to be used and things start to slow down considerably. If even the RAM is too small to hold the relevant data things really start to slow down: DISC has to be used. SSD is faster than traditional discs.

Gavin's article talks about how computational complexity scales with the *number of nodes/users*, not *blocksize*. Same is true for comment you linked. 
Can you explain what you meant by 


because I took it as "block verification complexity is O(n^2) with n = size of block", which I still think is untrue. 
I know of some attempts to argue that transaction verification scales superlinearly in the number of input (or outputs?) and I'm aware of that one attack. But that is again not talking about the *blocksize* but *number of inputs/outputs of a transaction*.
@_date: 2016-02-05 07:34:04


then why don't you move an inch on the blocksize debate?!? Some wanted 20 MB blocks but you're not ready to compromise even a tiny bit because "slippery slope" and "centralization risk". Add your (be it only perceived or real) conflict of interest and maybe you can understand why people don't just take *your* opinion as consensus.
You can't just dictate consensus.

You can put that into your bitcoin.conf file (without the "-") or pass it as an argument when starting bitcoind or bitcoin-qt.

Thank you Amichateur for your extensive answer.
I'm trying to keep an open mind and I definitely *am* using my own thought. It's very easy to get caught in politics, emotions or personalities in the current climate. Bitcoin has powerful enemies and their most effective weapon is division of the community (notice how there seem to be payed shills and shallow troublemakers stirring up emotions in all corners of the arena?).
Bitcoin unites us and outside forces (I do believe) are trying to divide us. It's working extremely well.
Reading your post gave me some hope that we at least have a chance to pull through.
I reconsidered segwit a couple of times but couldn't bring myself to like it... neither technically nor "politically". I don't consider LN a good solution for the problems we have, either, but I also admit there's a lot of *angst* and suspicion of malice in play when I look at the future regarding these solutions.
Also I think you have identified our greatest problem: it's close to impossible to have sensible discussions. At least when visibility is greater than a couple of people (like buried deep in some reddit thread or some btctalk thread with a low view-count) the trolling armies of assholes (from all camps) will roll in and destroy any hope of rational discourse.
Those paid troublemakers will not run out of money, unfortunately. For that it's working way too well. Unfortunately I know no soluton to this problem, except maybe IRL meetings where this kind of shit is unlikely to be pulled off on a large enough scale.

* make it easier to copy/paste addresses or tx ids (when I move the mouse over the tx in this pic:  it shows the tx ID in upper right, which is great. But in order to copy the tx id, I would have to move the mouse out of the red ring without selecting one of the many outputs, which is impossible afaik)

I agree on the computational load being high for verification. Sipas tuned ecdsa stuff has helped a lot here, though (thanks Pieter!)


are you sure about not many read operations needed?
The UTXO set is constantly needed to verify transactions (In a rather randomly distributed fashion no less) afaik. If that doesn't fit in RAM, good luck needing "not many reads".
So how big is it?
     bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo
    {
       "height": 464105,
       "transactions": 19756171,
       "txouts": 49358294,
       "bytes_serialized": 1951430246,
     }
So currently 1.8 GiB in serialized form (not sure how much unpacked to RAM in usable structure). If that doesn't fit into the dbcache (default setting is just 300 MiB), you might end up with a lot of random read operations on disc. This is consistent with observations I made in the past during initial sync.

so for "biggest blocker for larger blocks you offer":


Sending all transactions to every node is by design in bitcoin. Clearly this quite "naturally" limits its capacity and also scalability. This has been known for a long time. I'm not sure, is the idea here that limiting the capacity artificially will keep the nodecount desireably high or something along those lines?


So larger blocks are penalized by orphaning risk cost? Very good, then we don't need an artificial blocksize limit at all imo.


Here I don't understand the language. I would be happy if you could rephrase that.

The problem of block propagation (more specifically orphan risk and resulting centralization effects) is one of the arguments that has been brought against bigger blocks. I've always thought this to be kind of farcical because of the relay network already alleviates that, but this just makes it clearer. Propagation delay is not a very good reason against a blocksize increase.

I'm sick of people talking about the 1 MB blocksize limit as a consensus rule. Yes, technically it is. But that wasn't the *intention*. Keeping it in there is the actual CHANGE. **It was just a safety valve that should've long been removed.** I don't see how that can be denied.
Now the narrative that it's somehow part of the "holy unchangeable rules" is being pushed on us by personal and corporate agenda. And we're even dumb enough to fall for it and start discussing about wether it should be *raised*. It should just be *removed*. If 3MB blocks are problematic for miners then they will not mine them by *their own incentive*. No need to dictate a max block size.
 
I'd like people to think back to when they joined bitcoin. Did you really subscribe to a vision of 4 tps maximum capacity settlement chain and the rest is supposed to use dubious "offchain solutions like circle, paypal, ripple, LN, or some perfectionist genious' brain-fart yet to be let evaporate..."? Or was it **"send money for almost no fee to anyone without censorship or middlemen"**?
Hand to heart: did you really consider the 1 MB limit (*if* you even knew about it) to be one of the unchangeable consensus rules like the 21 million BTC cap?

Not just cpu power for indexing. The blocks need to be verified and all the transactions in them. This requires looking up stuff in the list of unspent transaction output. Disk latency can play a large role in slowing this down so an ssd can help a great deal (has much lower access latency than a platter) if the cache is too small. Look at my other post on how to increase database cache, it's probably even more effective and will speed things up beyond what can be done with switching to ssd alone (is my hunch)

ok. It doesn't really matter (from an economic perspective) how you implement "more transactions" technically as long as the fees (or a large part of those) actually end up paying the miners for securing the chain and you don't introduce new centralizations or otherwise harm features like privacy or censorship resistance. If those fees aren't payed to the miners (at least in large part), you can look at some altcoins for reference of what kind of problems having an "attackable" chain brings.

Sorry for coming across rudely before.
I'm familiar with the big O notation and its semantics. Also with the basic classes of computational complexity. Thanks for the explanations anway.
You think it's a "math thing on my end". So ok, let's run with that and please let me ask specific questions:


This is where you're losing me, because if you read [Maxwells post you linked above]( I don't see him talk about blocksize. He talks about "adding users to the network". He's talking about the network, not transaction validation. So how can you use his post as support for your claim?
Apart form that, I understand what you're saying:


I don't see that. Please help me... Verifying (that's the relevant computation, right?) 200 transactions instead of 100 should take *twice* as long. It's not like you have to do anything "for each **pair** of transactions", which would imply O(N^2 ) complexity. Please show why it takes *4 times* as long.

Thin blocks greatly amplifies this positive effect, so that even nodes with low network bandwidth can still have low propagation latency.

that's not true. any amount of money can support any size economy if it's divisible enough. prices will adjust accordingly when the economy grows and the money supply is kept constant.
of course, if you measure the "growth" of the economy in USD (as an example of an elastic (usually growing) money supply), it can easily be "grown" by injecting freshly printed money into it. Such growth is fake, though, and does not reflect an increase in wealth.

that's worded a bit strangely. If you have &gt;50% of the hashing power, you can ignore a recently found block and work on a branch of the chain and try to make it the longest chain (while the honest miners still work on the longest chain, which includes that block), thereby orphaning that block (an orphan is defined as a block that is not part of the longest chain). So you actually have to find 2 blocks while the honest miners only need one.
Of course you still can't introduce invalid blocks successfully (like ones that contain double-spending transactions or generate 1 trillion BTC out of thin air), because the honest miners will reject these blocks even in the longest chain. 
All you can do is rewrite some recent history. It still must be history according to the rules, though.

A bitcoin transaction has one or more inputs and one or more outputs. The sum of the inputs equals the sum of the outputs plus fee. So for example if you have 1 input: 6 BTC and want to send 2 BTC to someone, you have to send the remaining 4 BTC (change) to one of your own addresses.

680W? Last time I checked a 5970 does about 800 mhash/s at 300W. You'd need 25 to get 20GH/s, which would draw 7500W from your socket.
Also: reward will not be halved by July. It'll halve around December 9th (plus minus 2 weeks), and reward might have less of an impact than you think, because it'll drop supply of bitcoins to the exchanges by 50% which should increase the exchange rate considerably.

panic selling. not the thief. he has to launder the coins first. it's not so easy to just sell 30k of stolen BTC. Think about it. You have to identify to mtgox in order to withdraw &gt;$10,000 per month. The money is trackable to an extent, so you can't just deposit it to an exchange, because the exchanges are tracking the stolen coins.

I don't see a difference (in effect) between a "panic sell", a "stop loss being triggered" and a "forced position liquidation".

**That has to be an unconditional: yes.**
You should always do that, not only when forks are happening.
And that goes for *any* service that controls the keys to your coins (if even, they might just have a balance for your account in their db and run a 'fractional reserve' scheme)
You should be the one controlling the keys. Otherwise those coins are not your coins.
Here are the questions you should ask yourself if you want to be sure you "own bitcoin":
 * 1) can you locate your bitcoins on the blockchain(s)?
 * 2) are you the only person that has the ability to spend these?
if 1) is a no, then what you own *are not bitcoins*, but some IOUs.
if 2) is a no, you don't *own* those coins.
if 1) and 2) are a yes, you're doing it right and you are a real bitcoiner.

also: at least when I was still using localbitcoins, there was close to no incentive to actually use their system to make the transaction and pay the fee they charge. I always just used a normal transaction to save the fee. The only incentive is if you want to build a reputation, you might want the trade registered on localbitcoins system. Also: once a trading relationship is established, other means of communication can be used to setup subsequent deals.
So those numbers are likely scewed downwards (and I assume by a non-negligible amount) by this.
I agree that it's still negligible. It's similar as with the 2013 cyprus hype. The media said people in cyprus were buying bitcoin to protect against an EU money grab / bank bailin. It was technically true: 2 or 3 people from cyprus actually bought some bitcoin.

This is not necessarily true. In case of signature scheme changes for example (not the case with 2x, but with Bitcoin Cash for example) the hw wallet manufacturer needs to support the new scheme and put out a new firmware. Otherwise you wont be able to sign transactions on the "replay-protected" fork (sidenote: here you have part of the reason for the fuzz being made over 2x replay protection). If the manufacturer doesn't support it, you'll lose the security properties of the device because you'll have to use the seed to gain access using some software running on less secure hardware.

An exchange also acts as a depository, with all the insurance and regulation etc. that brings in the real world.

Hashing cost (the majority of the mining cost you seem to use to arrive at $1) is independant of the number of transactions you put into blocks. So if you want to make transactions cheaper, just increase the block size.
@_date: 2015-09-11 03:18:41


Nice theroretical idea. Except the attacker doesn't *pay* a fee unless the transactions gets into a block, which isn't the case during an ongoing mempool-targeting DDOS.
If your DDOS protection depends on the capacity of a crippled payment system, then the protection is crippled itself.

cool thread you linked. Hearn:


This whole debate sure starts to sound to me like an "theoretical information technology scientists" arguing with a "practical software engineer".
I've worked with a 'perfectionist' type of person on a project before: after a week of joint work, some module would be 80% done. Generally working well, just a couple of bugs to fix and edge cases to implement and a level would be reached where the customer would be 100% satisfied. The solution would not be 100% perfect from a scientific point of view, though. There would be 2 or 3 other, potentially better, ways of solving or implementing it. This guy would actually **delete all the code** with the words: "we have to start over, the design is not perfect and could fail in certain cases. There's a better way, let's build this more elgantly and resource-efficiently like this..." and come up with purely theoretical failure modes or potential performance issues to back up his decision (FUD) while the code was performing within expectation right in front of our eyes. Sometimes I let him do it because, well, I'm also always interested in more elegant, cleaner solutions. But soon I realized that the next solutions would usually also turn out to be 'not quite it'. So often I had to stop him, because there just wasn't any time for 'perfect' and the customer wanted results. *Actual* results, not theoretical ones. 
The 'perfect' truly *is* the enemy of the 'good'.

@_date: 2015-04-22 18:25:01
Interesting question. To be honest I can't imagine for example bitfinex seeing themselves as the contract partner. For a while they had 'insurance' the lenders could buy (cost: 25% of the interest, I think). When shit hit the fan (market doesn't allow necessary liquidation), the insured loans would be payed with higher priority (before the uninsured ones). This clearly hints at the fact that bfx would not see itself to be held responsible to pay the uninsured lenders.
Another question: is it legally possible to enter into a contract with an unknown (to you) identity somehow? In other words: are there types of contracts in which some of the participants are not explicitly identified?
@_date: 2015-09-11 10:47:38
that's transactions being *broadcast* to the network. There's no explicit limit to that.
The 3-4 limit is implied by the blocksize limit (1MB), the time it takes to mine blocks (~ 10 minutes) and some assumed average size of typical transactions (some 100s of bytes?) for transactions that are being *confirmed* (by becoming part of a block).

reducing the problem of scalability to "enabling faucet transactions and satoshi dice" is greatly misleading.
If Trace wants to sell Bitcoin as a tool for capital flight that's cool with me, but if he thinks 1 MB blocks are sufficient to support his super-important (because they increase the bitcoin price, like that's the most important goal) and it's ok to ignore all other use cases (like banking the unbanked, for example) then I can't help but think that's a bit arrogant.

some more 'politically' oriented suggestions:
* Private money like Bitcoin can help disentangle money and state
* Bitcoin is a weapon people can use to defend their freedom against oppressive governments
* Bitcoin can be a tool for the people to protect themselves against the 'hidden inflation tax' and/or 'theft by monetary policy'
* Central banking is 'central planning' and will fail.
* the 'freedom of transaction', like the 'freedom of speech' and the 'freedom of assembly', is a necessary prerequisite for a functioning democracy

No it wasn't (but I knew beforehand). I mined about 5 BTC with it. At the time I could've bought around 80 BTC for those $400 (guessing I bought it in early 2012, not sure really).

It could theoretically be argued that *a* (average number of tx per user) is not a constant. It seems to be done by the first group of people Gavin talks about (those arguing O( n^2 ) using Metcalfe's Law, if these really exist). As Gavin argues it's rather ridiculous to assume that people would send transactions to more and more users as they join the network. I would treat *a* as constant personally.

Thanks for your explanation.
You talk about how bitcoin exchanges use automatic liquidation instead of margin calling...


How would you implement a margin call technically. With bitcoin it has to be settled quickly, there's simply not much time to wait for the user to make his decision and transfer the funds. Since in addition users can often be anonymous, it is cumbersome and error-prone (if not impossible) to try to collect negative balances after the fact.
So I guess the exchanges just went the route of not margin calling at all but shoving the responsibility to the user who can easily provide funds beforehand by depositing and simply liquidating positions automatically before they can't be covered by deposited user funds any more.
I think it's a good way. There are many reports (from the 'real' world) where people (naive or reckless people) went bankrupt because they opened highly leveraged positions and ended up with huge debt towards their brokers when shit went against their position. Forced liquidation also puts a cap on any debt occurring towards the exchange. Debt is deadly in the bitcoin world.


How is that risky? Just put enough collateral and you're fine. Put yourself in the position of the exchange and by extension the lenders there: you have customers that are anonymous to you. How on earth would you collect the debt incurred by their bad positions should they not 'stump up the cash'. Now **that's** risky... irresponsible really. You simply don't have the luxury to wait and see wether he'll pay up or not. You have to act.. NOW.
Take as an example the icbit.se futures exchange (now called "orderbook" it seems) and how things were handled some time ago at settlement time of the futures (if I recall correctly): If the counterparty wouldn't pay up, you'd be out of luck. Do you think customers liked this approach? They wanted to settle their future bets and only got satoshis on the bitcoin because their counterparties defaulted and weren't to be identified legally. Later they tried socializing the losses. Customers didn't like that either. 
Do you think lenders on bitfinex (as an example) would lend out their precious coins if repayment of the loan was dependant on trusting some anonymous traders honesty to pay his debt?

They're solving a problem that doesn't currently exist. I doubt it will. Basically they say there's negative incentive for miners to pass on transactions.
The network does not consist of only miners. Actually most of the network currently consists of simple nodes that don't do any mining.
Let's assume for the sake of the argument, that all people start using light clients and don't participate in transaction propagation. The network will be made up of miners and some of them might indeed start withholding transactions...
How long do you think it will take from detection of this being done to either harmfull action by the community towards that "bad miner" or the popping up of well-connected nodes (actually these already exist, they're the light clients transaction distribution nodes), that will push your transactions to many nodes? Probably somewhere in between 0 to 2 hours.
So: neither does this problem exist now, nor will it ever.
 if you want to help, put a miner and/or bitcoin wallet in windows by default.

there's also the [ssss]( tool. Shamirs Secret Sharing. It allows to break down any number into n parts, with m of them needed for reassembly. So just in case one lawyers fucks up the safekeeping, you could use a 3 of 4 sss split, for example. 
You also don't really need to involve lawyers. Trusted family member will probably do the job just fine. Maybe one should use a relatively high ratio of n to m to allow for some losses, though.
The questions to ask when choosing n and m are:
  * Do you trust any subset of size n of people to not collude against you? (In your case: do you trust the 3 attorneys to not collude against you)
  * Do you trust that at most (m-n) poeple fail to reproduce the data you give them? (In your case: do you trust that all 3 attorneys will be able to give you access to the data you provided them with?)
Noteworthy attacks and failure modes:
 * 1 or more participants decide to rip you off and manage to steal the data from enough other participants. (This is not unlikely if you use family members)
 * too many (&gt; m-n) participants fail to produce the data you gave them
 * ssss tool is unavailable to you in the future or you made some mistake when using it (test our procedures, safekeep code of version you used)
 * you reused the address (when testing, for example) and your private key gets successfully attacked by someone with access to a quantum computer. (don't reuse keys)

It's not even about actual deletions (on btctalk my favorite thread got deleted in its entirety, "gold collapsing, bitcoin up"). It's about the fact that I find myself thinking "should I really write that? Maybe better omit this part so the post stays up..." when writing a post. **Self-censorship, the feeling of being observed and controlled.**.
Above-mentioned thread found a new home [here]( btw. But: what a hassle. So what does this do to the community? Nothing positive I fear. It hurts the sense of community.


The masses of course. **It's no fun to hang out in the woods like an outcast while everyone is having a party in the city.** What can I do, I'm just human. The last post on was a year ago and posts have 1 or 2 upvotes. Go figure, it's all about critical mass. I  barely manage to reject skype and whatsapp, but the Bitcoin people are just too important to me to reject communication with.


Of course I'm reconsidering. Look, here I am. It's a tragedy of the commons of sorts.
Frankly I still don't understand what exactly is happening here. I had formed a rough opinion on the blocksize issue and it was a bit concerning that my opinion was being held by Hearn and Gavin, 2 personas I have some reservations towards. People I respect and trust on the other hand (like Peter Wuille for example) held a different opinion. So I tried to find out (again) what drove this other opinion of keeping the blocksize as is. I opened my mind, read opinions and asked questions. I just couldn't find any convincing argument and the reasoning I held *for* a blocksize increase still stood there. 
Next thing I see is all discussion about this issue being suffocated by censorship, huge outcry and shit... of course I stand defiantly in the corner with the other outcasts compiling Hearns patches. Do I enjoy that? Hell no, but what should I do, shut up and repeat the mantra: "Peter Todd is smarter than me. Theymos will protect my values. 1 MB blocks forever! The scaling messiah will come!"?

Depends of your definition of "anywhere close".
Sweden is getting closer and closer at an accelerating pace. Their cash in circulation already dropped from [~105 billion krona to ~80 billion]( That process is accelerating, too.
The Treasury doesn't have to muster up any courage. Simple propaganda (cash only used by criminals, cash is dirty and transmits diseases, maybe even AIDS from drug addicted sex workers, cash is also dangerous to have, burglaries are on the increase,... you get the idea). 
Shops will start to switch to "no cash"-policies (they much rather be able to identify you and track your shopping habits anyway) and when the tipping point is reached, everyone will switch to using plastic (databased money with identified transactors) and even [feel good about it]( (because of the propaganda and the perceived convenience).
It's a slow process and that's why it can be done: the frog doesn't feel the absolute temperature of the water surrounding him and barely notices the slight increases.
So in case "anywhere close" is 10 years, I'd say it's easily possible.

They still have enough reason to play by the rules.
Bitcoin's security model assumes &gt;50% of miners are honest. If that's not the case then indeed, a massive network of honest nodes *could* save the day.
Is this really the main reason some don't want bigger blocks?

you're forgetting the next steps:
 * gov: it's not working, terrorist are using opensoure software, so now sending encrypted (or random) data is now forbidden, all communications (like website visits, email,...) are subject to a new permit that must be applied for on a case by case basis from our new agency, the communications overlook agency (COKA).
 * citizen: you're clearly batshit insane, we revolt now, heads roll
 * terrorist: yay, goal reached!
@_date: 2015-11-20 22:29:39
something like this is to be expected, though. People (companies more than individuals) need to be able to be sure they can get the write access to the blockchain they need for their business case. They'll be willing to pay for such guarantees so there's a market. Money to be made.

Bitcoin is censorship resistant and you are your own bank, no middleman can rip you off. No third party safekeeps (or not) your money.
I wouldn't say that's "more efficient" (especially with the current capacity limit problems), but it's certainly *more powerful*.
The non-reversability is a feature, not a bug. For online shopping payments people should use escrow services, but we haven't gotten far enough for widespread use of that.
As in an investment or for store-of-wealth purposes I have to agree with you: noone knows wether it's a good choice for that at this point. High risk.
@_date: 2016-10-27 06:09:06
You have correctly acknowledged the fact that there is a war going on and that governments/bankers may well accept the existence of bitcoin if it's small.
You have however failed to correctly identify the first waves of attacks (starting ~2013). Instead, you even defend one of these.

1 and 2 are proposals I support (at my current knowledge level). I view the lightning network as an off-chain tech, though. It uses payment channels to setup a micropayment network on top of bitcoin.
I'm not sure what you mean with 4.? Invertible bloom lookup tables are used in the O(1) block propagation proposal. They don't magically make blocks smaller, they 'only' reduce bandwidth requirement when propagating blocks (reducing orphan rate as you state in 3.), making use of the fact that miners/nodes in all likelyhood already have the majority of transactions of a new block in their memory pool.

Hell yeah I'm worried about that shit. 
We need cash, desperately. I think it's extremely important: we need to be able to make person to person transactions without 'authorities' knowing or being able to censor them. Imo freedom of economic transaction is on par with freedom of speech. You take it away, you don't have a free society any more. 
The black markets (or at least the possibility of their existence) are a necessity, a stronghold against oppression by states and big corporations.

 * the 1 MB blocksize limit *prevents* on-chain scaling.
 * Not having SegWit does *not prevent* off-chain scaling.
SegWit just isn't necessary for either of those? Why demand to have it as a precondition ("first step")? 
@_date: 2016-05-21 07:04:14
Not sure what you're saying, especially by "have it go through several transactions". A "decent fee" (what is that, exactly?) does not guarantee inclusion, either.
The *safe* approach is to wait for confirmation(s) before passing over the merchanise.
If you can't afford the wait, you should make sure the tx is not market RBF and probably use other metrics. There are services that make accepting 0-conf easier. Some (like bitpay et al) will also shoulder the risk for you.

It's far from perfect, but if you really need to make anonymous payments, it *can* be done with cryptocurrencies. You're much more likely to be deanonymized by [some other way]( than by your bitocoin payments being somehow tracked back to you. That's what's most important: the general possibility of anonymous payments.
Even more important imo is the censorship-resistance. Afaik as of now this is unchallenged in bitcoin.

I can see through that BS, man. Stalling, stalling, stalling for years. And then accusing US of stalling. WTF?!?
It doesn't matter what blocksize you *would* be willing to agree to if you have preconditions that keep changing so they're never met and you never actually *do* agree to anything. That's just making promises. I know this line from people that owe money. Guess what: they NEVER pay.

There's also an issue with *spending* from the same address multiple times (which you would likely do in such scenario): making a tx publishes the public key. Yes, it's just the public key, but you're removing an extra layer of protection (a hashing step) so you're increasing your potential attack surface. This is especially important in light of potential quantum computing based attacks which could use the public key to attack your private key. Without the public key, even quantum attacks are hard.
In addition there have been some problems (money lost) with signatures of certain wallets being weak in the sense that 2 signatures using the same key had been successfully used to calculate the key. It was due to bad RNG used for some value used to construct the signatures and the issue only affected certain wallets, but it shows that you're adding additional risk by reusing keys.
Maybe for donations something like stealth addresses or [payment codes]( would be good.

yes, and the great thing is: in other commodities miners manage to increase supply when price takes a hike north. With bitcoin this is a very temporary effect because the harder they mine, the less merciful the difficulty adjust will be ;-). 
In other words: bitcoin mining supply doesn't increase with price. In fact it probably even decreases because miners aren't forced to sell as much.

And how did that work out? Right! Their coin wasn't valued by the market so they lost out on profit and hence lost influence. Miners making decisions the market doesn't like will die out over time.




That would be bad, because Bitcoin assumes profit-seeking, self-interested miners who are smart enough to make decisions the market will value.

No, they're not. "compact blocks" and "xthin blocks" take the block peaks off. So assuming transactions trickle in relatively evenly, we can calculate the bandwidth requirements pretty easily.
Transactions worth 1 MB per 10 minutes boil down to 1 MB / 600s = **1.6 kbyte/s** (for 1 connection)
Double that for overhead and transactions that don't get mined and we have 3.2 kbyte/s.
That number is "per connection", so assuming 8 connections, we're looking at *25 kbyte/s* for 1 MB blocks.
**So that'd be 1.6 mbit/s average for 8 MB blocks.**
And latency? Please! Why? That can only be interesting for miners, right?
EDIT: noticed my error of mixing up kbit with kbyte. Fixed that. Argument still stands.

hmm, wait. maybe I'm misunderstanding something here, but:
I figure headers first would allow to download the block headers (most imortantly the merkle root). So then I have all the headers and I can verify the integrity of the chain. I just dont have the transactions yet, but I know their merkle root.
I can always request missing blocks (including transactions) from other nodes and I can be sure they are honest because I can verify the merkle root (which I already know) matches. So your argument that this would make the network less honest seems to be false.
Would that be considered a full node? Not sure.

Core is the one blocking scalability for almost 2 years now.
@_date: 2017-07-12 18:36:38


I think that's for the individual miner to evaluate. While the propagation time with Compact Blocks (or XThinBlocks or FIBRE or whatever) is less of an issue than without those optimizations, it still holds true that the larger the block, the higher the orphan risk. This is not only due to propagation latency, but also due to higher verification time needing to be spent at the receiving miners before those can mine on that block.
**This means each miner has to weigh the additional amount of fees he can make by including more transactions and making his block bigger against the increased orphan cost and find a sweet spot between extremes balancing those costs.** A self-regulating process driven by profit-maximization incentive! Isn't that fabulous?
That's why I think with no blocksize limit in the consensus rules, the size of blocks will find (or oscillate around) an equilibrium, driven by miner incentives.
On a side-note: It sounds like you might think orphans are a bad thing. Orphans are not really a problem from the network's point of view and are part of the design. They are only a problem for the individual miner who is the victim. If, for example, a rogue miner decided to mine a huge, expensive-to-verify block, that block would have a high chance of getting orphaned. The network / blockchain couldn't care less. That wasted hashrate doesn't even count in the next difficulty adjustment... it's as if that miner had done nothing.

Your post is just FUD.
Even the whole network "crashing wholesale" wouldn't jeopardize the whole industry. We'd be back up and running very quickly.
BU nodes didn't "wholesale crash", either (at least not that I'm aware of). Maybe you mean the instance where a buffer overflow or something was exploited in xthin code? Nodes where patched (or xthin disabled) and back up pretty quickly. The network didn't "go down wholesale" and nothing was jeopardized, because there was diversity in implementations.
Bugs are part of software, that's just a fact. And if you think bitcoin-core has no bugs, then you're just clueless. Core also suffered and will suffer from bugs, just like any software. That's why diversity is a good thing.
Also, I don't see you FUDding against btcd or libbitcoin (alternative implementations). Maybe it's because they honor core consensus rules?

It's not *my* attack, but if it works, there is no way to validate the signatures of the segwit transactions because they are unknown (weren't published) and never will be. It's still a valid block (since segwit was done as a softfork) even without the sigs.
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:52:58




Exactly. I absolutely agree we should discern "changes to the consensus layer" and "implementation decisions".
What core is doing is using the same government mechanism for both of these and I don't think it's a good idea to use it for "changes to the consensus layer".
Let me remark here that I view the blocksize limit to not be part of the consensus layer. It was technically implemented in that place but that was wrong. Initially there was no blocksize limit in the consensus layer, only a 32MB "technical" limit in the protocol layer (where it belongs). Hence I don't view the removal of the blocksize limit as a change of the consensus rules. It's just fixing a bug for me. I hope you can at least understand that (you don't have to agree).


you're forgetting altcoins. Or do you consider those to be "hostile"?


A minority fork (for example) into an altcoin is *hostile* in your view? Why? The minority isn't forcing the majority into anything. It's non-coercive, voluntary.
I repeat what I said earlier: splitting the chain is a viable process for governance of the consensus rules. In fact it's the only one I can think of (except for somehow actually producing consensus about the proposed change of the consensus rules, of course).

what I don't get about this: why can't the olive-oil producers just live with less money? Why can't prices be generally lower in greece compared to germany? Let's say there's no import/export to/from greece at all... the whole country could be run on 1 EUR (increasing divisibility of the EUR a bit), no?
Regarding import/export: assuming greece had a local currency and a monetary policy to adjust it to the size of their economy. Well, greece still has to pay USD for crude oil and other imports, no? Why is it different if they pay in USD directly versus exchanging their drachma or whatever to USD first? 
If they print more drachma (say they double monetary base), they wont magically get more crude oil for the same amount because the exchange rate would be cut in half.
I really don't comprehend the idea of adjusting the monetary base to the local economy. If someone could explain how this works, I'd be happy.
Right now this just seems like an excuse for money printing to me.

I was playing it safe. Actually only 1 person I talked to (talked to probably around 30 people) supported core. Also not every "bigblocker" is opposed to segwit. Actually a lot aren't.

not to pad myself on the back, but I think I went through all of those stages when I read the satoshi paper ;), or I skipped them, I don't know. I *do* know I was totally 'on fire' by the time I was finished and I also know I'm not alone with that experience.
Having thought about certain things beforehand and an IT background sure helped.
I guess if you don't have some of those prerequisites, it can take quite some time to reach the 'acceptance' stage.
I used to use as rule of thumb that it would take roughly 6 weeks for someone to go from first contact with bitcoin to making a sizable purchase. That was in 2012. I used this to try to predict reallies after big media exposure events.
Maybe we're tapping into a demographic that takes much longer for this process... &gt; 1 year (!).
With all the media exposure in 2014 this could very well set us up for a load of new users.
I'm still expecting 2016 to be a big year for Bitcoin regarding adoption (and also price).

No, a misunderstanding. If I said that I made a mistake. I suggest they use a different repo.




No, same as above.




Watching a [recent interview with Jihan Wu]( might give some insight about what he's thinking. I think signaling "BU" is just saber-rattling. In his mind there was a "soft agreement" reached at the Scaling conference in Milan. Core can still fix things by delivering hf code.


No, but about what he *said* in the Bitcoin paper, maybe? It's not about Satoshi as a person or about what he sais now, it's about his idea everyone signed up to when they got into Bitcoin. I view it as sort of a social contract. It included on-chain scaling.


Miner wants more money, not bigger block. All money is flowing into altcoins. Miner sees that. Bigger block is just a possibility for miner to reverse that bleeding process.




Not everyone gets a say there. Most people are turned away getting told essentially: "you're dumb, trust us, we're the experts".


I want miners to evaluate what the market wants and then decide that. If it's unclear, a split can be made. Then then everyone gets what he wants.
Their reluctance to act pisses me off, too, but then there's always the possibility to switch to altcoins. 
The market will get what it wants and that's a good thing.

I think that's largely a myth, as [Wences Cesares explains](
Ancient money was debt-based. A ledger in the collective mind of the poeple (small groups). People just remembered who owed what to whom. 
Only later did trade amongst larger groups made more trustless ledgers necessary, like gold or other commodities.
Regarding multiparty bartering with "temporary barter credits"... what's the difference to just using those credits as money and doing buy/sell economics? I don't quite see the upside and just some complicated x-way-barter-system to maintain.

Thanks for your elaborate reply, XxionxX. I finally found some time to discuss some parts...


It will probably make the great depression look like peanuts.


This is the case, but less and less so over time. China, Russia, India, Brazil, South Africa have other plans and noone really except the US (shortsightedly) is happy about it.
The USA have greatly misused the "exorbitant priviledge" of being able to print the world reserve currency. Can one blame them? I think it just *had* to go wrong. The world shouldn't have trusted any one nation with managing the money supply. In fact I think money supply should not be managed at all, but fixed.
Let me quote [a speech by Charles de Gaulle](


Well. Charles de Gaulle might have foreseen the troubles we now have with using a particular countries money as reserve currency, but he has obviously not foreseen bitcoin. Bitcoin *could* be another standard criteria apart from gold.
One thing is clear, though: we cannot keep using the dollar or any other fiat currency with a managed supply 'they' might come up with. The low interest rate policies are screwing up the economy. It can't function as it should because the function of saving is being destroyed and price signals are being distorted. Markets aren't markets any more, they're just a farce now and fail to fullfil important functions. This also leads to misallocations of capital: we're pumping money into the stupidest ideas and blowing bubbles everywhere.


I strongly disagree here. The collusion of the central banking cartel and governments all over the world under the fiat money regime is not just *one of many tools*. Do you really think the US government would be the size it is and do you think the US military would be waging all these wars, maintaining all the firepower and bases all around the globe if it had to be financed by visible taxes in a sound money system? Do you think the taxpayer would be happy to come up for the worldwide wholesale spying the NSA/GCHQ/etc are doing? This kind of stuff is only possible in a fiat money regime, where the population can be secretly milked via monetary inflation.
On a social level we're looking at ever-increasing wealth disparity. This is also due to the bad kind of money we're using.
ok, well, I had many more things to say, but since this is reddit and only a handful will read this old thread, I'm going to stop here (unless you or someone else wants to discuss more).
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:17:11


good discussion, yes. Thank your for that. Unfortunaley I'm running out of time, so this is probably my last response.


I'd be totally fine with something like that. [BIP100]( for example.


Are you talking about the people who want the blocksize limit raised? How is that a "completely different" consensus layer. That's how Bitcoin has operated up until 2016, when the limit got hit substantially.


Same can be said for the other side. Blocksize limit increase was suggested first, btw. Segwit/LN later. Also: Segwit is not a "completely different consensus layer"? Because it's done as a softfork?


Yeah, well. I would've done it, but even a minority fork without change of PoW requires a lot of hashpower (~30%) and miners are so afraid because of the hardfork FUD.


Oh, it's a fight for the name "Bitcoin" in my mind. Otherwise forking off doesn't hurt, right?


Can you understand why people (me included) view SegWit2x as a trap given the part I bolded? The problem is that the hardfork to 2 MB is only a promise. Once SegWit is activated, the hardfork FUD machine (it's too soon, we need more time, people need to prepare, there will be a permanent split, the sky will fall) will start up again and miners could just switch back to core. So one side gets 2 things they want (Segwit, no blocksize increase) and the other side gets 0 things they want (absolutely nothing). **How on earth is that a fair compromise?**

You could very well track copyright ownership using a blockchain (or *the* bitcoin blockchain), just as you can track any asset ownership using a blockchain.
The tricky part is getting everyone to agree that that blockchain is the authoritative ledger reflecting that ownership.
If such an agreement was a reality, one could easily prove ownership by signing a message with the appropriate key.
I like the idea very much, it would make trading copyright trustless. I just think it's not easy to implement due to the 'tricky part' mentioned above.
I guess maybe it could be solved by the original creator signing a contract of sorts that essentially says: the copyright to this work is owned by the entity in control of token x on blockchain y. That way the ownership would be linked to the blockchain and maybe enforcable in certain jurisdictions.
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:43:54
The critical resource is the UTXO set (both for LN and on-chain). The size of this set scales with the number of bitcoin users (both for LN and on-chain). You don't really need the full transaction history, just the UTXO set is sufficient and if miners put UTXO commitments into the block headers, the security guarantees are very similar to fully verifying tx history.
 * LN is *not* a solution to scale the number of bitcoin users.

There's plenty of room. 8 MB / 10 minutes is a joke. The average bandwidth used is negligible (tx broadcasts). To take the peaks off when a block is found we have "compact blocks", "xthin blocks".

No, let the miners decide what they want in the code and the developers just provide the service of coding it.

@_date: 2017-07-05 16:19:45
Ok, I'll have to deliver...
There's many reasons why it's not a good idea. I'll just pick one angle:
**Because A Segwit Coin is not a Bitcoin.**
 * Segwit coins have a differnt definition than bitcoins, which gives them different properties
 * Unlike with bitcoin, miners can update their UTXO sets without witnessing the previous owners digital signatures
 * The previous owners digital sigantures have significantly less value to a miner for segwit coins than for bitcoins because miners do not require them in order to claim fees
 * Although a stable Nash equilibrium exists where all miners witness the previous owners digial signatures for bitcoins, one does NOT exist for segwit coins.
If you understand these points (which are not mine, I took them from [here]( you will see that segwit potentially takes a lot of control from the users of bitcoin (signatures is all they have, really) and transfers that into trust in the miners. I think we already trust the miners enough and shouldn't give them even more power.
So segwit is a possibly well-implemented "bad idea" for that reason alone.

Thanks for bringing that up.
I think a lot of our problems / misunderstanding / hate against each other stems from the way we talk to each other. I talked to people at the Arnhem conference who had almost orthogonally opposed views to mine, yet the conversation was civil and we bought each other beer. We acknowledged each others ability to think clearly and took each other seriously. It's about respect.
I don't know how anyone can think the other party in the discussion is "stupid" and still expect to have a fruitful discussion.
To be honest... in online discussion I think the are a lot of people (on both sides) that are just trolls. Having fun stirring up peoples emotions by naming their ideas "dumb shit" or using personal attacks. This is a problem not only Bitcoin has, but in Bitcoin a lot is at stake (money, freedom for some,...) and people don't want to just leave lies and FUD just stand there uncontested for everyone to read. 
So they swallow the pill and engage with the trolls and the trolls love it.
(Remark: I also happen to think there are paid shills on both sides sawing distrust and hate among the community. A divide and conquer tactic that seems to be working extremely well. You don't have to believe this for the rest of my post to make sense)
Back to my point: in real life it's way harder to troll people and be disrespectful. Most trolls probably don't even leave their basements so a possible solution to our apparent communication problem would be to meet more physically. Go to conferences and local meetups. Those things enable fruitful discussion which foster understanding and learning about each other's view.
Online it just doesn't work. One dedicated troll is sufficient to destroy an otherwise sane discussion. It's really hard to stay calm and level-headed when some is out to get your emotions riled up. It's very easy to get ones emotions cooking: just argue illogically, post links to stuff that missing the point, copy/paste pre-fabricated propaganda,  move goalposts, cherry-pick points, attack/question the person / their qualification, argue by appeal to authority, be condescending, treat people like children (I actually think we should treat children differently than we do, but that's another issue), throw people in with a group and attack the group or member of that group. The list goes on.
All this crap can't be done IRL.

I'm in the process of thinking them through and they make a lot of sense. I understand the attack Peter describes in the talk (which is based on those claims), for example.
Even just the possibility of these points being true is enough for me to avoid segwit coins personally and to be against a rollout (although I would swallow the pill if the blocksize limit was removed at the same time, because then it would be correct that segwit is "opt-in" and I could just keep using Bitcoin). I think we shouldn't screw with bitcoin, it's too important and valuable to change the properties like that. A blocksize increase doesn't change anything regarding incentives or what players can or cannot do, it's the original idea. I want to continue the experiment as planned.
With a change like segwit that has unclear consequences, I think the burden of proof is on those who want the change. They must show it's secure and introduces no negative effects. Putting it in LTC doesn't do that, by the way. It's not being used enough there to draw conclusions and it's also not in use for long enough.

Your solution (pure segwit) wasn't accepted using the standards you set yourselves. (Tough luck, suck it up)
Now instead of helping out, all you do is piss on all other porposals from your high horses, including one (segwit2x) that has more then twice the support than your solution and actually gives you what you say you want (segwit).
The truth starts to shine through even to the least sensitive observer: what you *really* want is not just segwit, but also no blocksize limit increase,... EVER. AND continued gatekeeping power over the code people run.
If you get what you want, bitcoin will most likely fail.

You said "**will** then get remotely shutdown.", not "which **has been** remotely shutdown.".




They're not pushing anything. They're asking for the HK agreement to be fulfilled.

What "governance process". The governance process in Bitcoin is called "PoW". To quote the Bitcoin paper:

It's correct that this currently is the case, but you can't use that fact to argue for inlation because the fact itself is a result of that inflation.

Not everyone can invest. The poorest people have no access to stock markets. They can't afford houses and don't own businesses. They use money, though. Money that keeps losing value. Thus wealth is transferred from poor(er) people to more wealthy people. This effect keeps increasing and it *is* a problem.
And it's not promoting growth, it's just promoting production of shit noone needs (I'm exaggerating for clarity). Also: why is growth in itself desirable? Think of cancer, for example.

bitcoin 0.10 allows for "headers first synchronization". I think this makes it possible to run a full node without having to store the whole blockchain.

Certainly the customer isn't "liable". However, the service *does have* those very real costs (network fees when transacting the received coins).

Welcome! Glad to see you join. Good decision you made there for the long term, imo.
I feel the responsibility to make you aware of some short-term problems Bitcoin is facing. To educate yourself about this issue (it's about how to "scale" bitcoin to higher transaction capacity, there are 2 camps, at least, with almost orthogonal plans as to how to do it), I suggest you also take a look at the "other" subreddit (called btc instead of bitcoin).
As others have mentioned it makes a lot of sense to get acquianted to using a wallet you control the keys of and move your money there (best get a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger). This would not only remove coinbase as a risk, but also probably give you more options in case of a blockchain split (you'd own coins on all forks, not just the one coinbase decides to honor as "Bitcoin". You can even sell the ones you dislike should you develop a preference)
And one last thing: keep thinking for yourself!
Sidenote: I also completely missed the "ovaries", funny that.

Poppejans, I thank you for your input. I would love to continue the discussion, but being deep down in some "obscure" bitcoin thread with not many other people here, I am unsure wether it makes sense for us to put in the necessary energy to reach any kind of meaningful outcome.
I think you are very reasonable and it seems you could be a good "opponent" to discuss the issue at hand (which is very interesting to me) and further my insight both into the issue and into your thinking. My opinions are not set in stone and I'd like to keep an open mind.
I think general understanding of this issue (inflation/deflation and maybe also broader: money / monetary system / policy) is immensely important for society and it's underrepresented in the public mind.
In other words: I think we need to talk about the money we use and how it's being managed.
So I'm thinking maybe the two of us (or more poeple?) could establish some sort of structured dialog? It would have to be over a longer period of time and with low enough frequency to match the amount of energy I (and you) can put in.
This is just a thought and of course these issues have been discussed elsewhere at length. But if you're interested and have an idea as to how (technically) and/or where we could do this (could be email, some forum, ...), let me know.
@_date: 2016-07-09 21:07:00

the market has priced in what the participants understand about the halving.

Ok, I just checked. The tx history and addresses are unencrypted.
You could try sending 0.00001 BTC to yourself and see if electrum prompts you for a password. If it doesn't, you have access to the bitcoins (they are 'salvagable' in your words).

Thanks for clarifying where I could be more specific, I'll gladly comply.
By "user" I mean any person using Bitcoin in any way. Even if he's not running a node, even if he's using an SPV wallet or even a light client trusting some centralized server.
**How does that user increase security**? Simply by increasing the value of bitcoin and hence attracting more hashpower. The more hashpower the more secure against takeover attacks by governments for example.
**How does a simple user increase the value of bitcoin merely by using it**? Because the more people use a money, the more useful it becomes (network effect) and the more useful it is, the more valuable it becomes.
I hope this explains my view a little better.


This argument makes some assumptions I wouldn't think are true:
 * **higher fees make mining more profitable**: I think this is wrong or at least highly questionable: there are 2 more variables that need to be taken into account here: *number of transactions* and *bitcoin value* (market price in USD or whatever). I think both of these variables are dependant on the fee level: a higher fee will result in less users and less transactions and by my above argument make bitcoin less useful and less valuable.
 * **spam attacks are harmful and more costly with higher fees**: Depends what type of attack we're talking about. If you're trying to flood the mempools then higher fees are not a defense, the attacker can just underpay and thus even avoid having to actually pay the fee. So in that case the reverse could even be true. In case we're talking about a blockchain or utxo bloat attack I have to take the opinion that "if it pays a high enough fee, it's not spam". In other words: why is the spam tx any more harmful than a "legitimate" transaction if it pays the same fee?

Electrum relies on a cluster of servers for blockchain information. Those servers do the dirty work of keeping a copy of the blockchain (there's a full node in the background) and also keeping a quickly accessible database of unspent transaction outputs to inform electrum clients of address balances. They're also used to broadcast transactions to the Bitcoin network, of course.
Electrum clients connect to a couple of these servers and servers that get stuck somehow are kicked from the irc channel they publish themselves. Decentralization ftw. 
blockchain.info is a centralized service and seeing many apps rely on its API for blockchain data is questionable at best.

The way you describe it, I have to say it's not really a scam. Just because you lose money, doesn't necessarily mean it's a scam. It can also mean you're too lazy to research what you're doing, incompetent enough to calculate your risk and reward or too greedy to think at all. The same applies to "buying hardware and mining yourself". You could also call that a scam by that logic.

Are these kinds of projects is the answer to the fear that expresses itself in people when confronted with libertarian/anarchist ideas: "But what will happen to the poor if there is no state to support them?".
My usual answer is: "There would be much less poor people because of easier market access and a different kind of business climate allowing individuals, small entrepreneurs and locallly run companies to thrive due to lack of regulatory hurdles. The very small percentage of people who truly cannot work (due to physical conditions, being ill or whatnot) and have no direct familiy / social support, would probably be taken care of by local charities."
Most people don't believe the latter part would happen, and now I have an example to point them to.

something similar happened to namecoin. it was excruciating to watch (or actually use namecoin) the coin get to the block where merged mining would start.
EDIT: I doubt this will happen to bitcoin. The difficulty is not "crazy high" at all (compared to power cost). Most of the cost of mining is currently up-front (for getting the gear).
The ASICS cannot be used for anything else (except maybe mining some alt-coins, but given that bitcoin exchange rate crashing is the scenario probably these are crashing, too). The rate would have to crash hard for miners to turn off rigs.

Someone should give Peter a casascius coins already, so he can hold a Bitcoin in his hand and see the light. Maybe that's all it takes, who knows ;)


I think Peters problem understading this concept might be ontological. He talks about "paper *nothings*" (meaning fiat). Why would he value a "nothing" that doesn't even exist *or* has *any* physical representation whatsoever?
Well, it *does* exist. But it's information, not matter.
You can still protect it like you can protect matter (like gold) from access by others using cryptography together with the properties of the Bitcoin protocol. It is specifically built to allow that.
Maybe Schiff should sit down with someone knowledgable, a lot of time and maybe some good weed or red wine or whatever he prefers, let go of all his prejudices (okay, maybe lsd would be more adequate to crack those metal barriers) and try to understand how the blockchain, mining, asymmetric crypto, cryptographic hashes and incentive systems work together and how Bitcoin exploits the properties of these tools to solve the problem(s) it solves.

I think that's a good idea. That would require a chain split, though, which most seem to oppose.


Are you serious? You want "the devs" (how do you define that group and how is membership managed?) to have long-term say over protocol changes? Giving that power to a specific group of people will just result in that group of people being replaced / coerced / influenced / corrupted. No better than the current system of central banking, if you ask me.
The solution offered by Satoshi in Bitcoin is PoW mining. Wether that works or not is an experiment we're conducting. If you want to try something else, go ahead, make your coin controlled by a select group of people and don't try to change the experiment while it's still running.

This is false. Bitcoin is the longest PoW chain starting with the Bitcoin genesis block. Like it or not, but that's the idea.
You're free to fork off at any point, of course. There's no coercion, participation is voluntary.
If you manage to convince the miners to mine your fork then you have reached your goal, congratulations. You can do this by convincing (coercing?) enough econonomically important nodes to come along or by offering a better exchange rate for your segwit/LN coins, but you *have* to get the miners on board somehow (or: exclude them by change of PoW)

The way to solve this is not centrally administered taxes and wealth redistribution, but for the people to use sound money (like Bitcoin).

Under this condition it flows from the lazy to the productive.

Who do you mean by "author"? 
The article is just a factual report about a speech by Dr Jens Weidmann, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank.
It asks some questions at the end for discussion, but draws no conclusions.
Those are the questions (based on the suggestions of Weidmann regarding CB reaction to crypto):






My answers:in 
* 1.) No, not to any substantial extent.
* 2.) no effect on cryptos 
* 3.) they will not createy their own crypto and it would be hard to do (because they want to be able to print money at will to upkeep their stance that CBs never run out of money) and not an attractive currency for the crypto-crowd because the CB can always "pre-mine" or "free-mine" it.
I would rather suggest a different path for the CB to fight crypto (don't try to be better, just outright destroy them):
 * use open market operations to try to fuck with the market (introduce volatility, inflict pain to drive away newbs)
 * corrupt developers
 * divide community
 * limit bitcoin capacity
 * increase transactional friction in bitcoin (high fees)
 * fracture crypto-space into hundreds of alts to dilute supply and fracture community
much more effective (and already playing out for a couple of years now, btw)

It's really cool you're doing this, but I hate to say: I don't see myself migrating from bitcointalk. This sux and I would like to support alternative forums.
I supported Vladimirs forum 2 years or so ago, tried to help it get off the ground by writing some in-depth post, linking them from btctalk and generally being active and promotive. It was unable to draw any users from the black-hole like mass that is bitcointalk for any prolonged period of time.
After bitcointalk downtime my reddit use has increased. But that's about it, adding a 3rd place is probably not going to happen for me.
The only way I can see another forum take off is when it's already online when bitcointalk goes down again for longer than a couple of days. In that spirit: please keep it up, try to get users and post again when btctalk is down next time.

Coinjoin transactions cannot be identified on the blockchain. They can be made to look like ordinary transactions.
CoinJoin implementation doesn't require any change to blockchain or network protocol. It's just another layer needs to be added to "collboratively and privately assemble" such a transaction. That's what needs to be implemented and DarkWallet does that.

Contentious hard forks effectuate a split and are a viable governance model.


We want to make room for more users. High fees are just a sign that we're unable to service a lot of them.


En contraire, mon fraire: The more users, the more value, the safer and more decentralized the network will be. Send away all but 1 million people? Ok dude, you can have your little safe space. Offload transactions to 2nd layer? Not Bitcoin.


Of course you can't, because those are just unsubstantiated claims.


The network isn't struggling because of too many users, it's struggling because of the blocksize limit. Facebook once ran on one server. When that hit capacity limit, what do you think they did?

are you sure? I've had many people tell me something like this and when time came, they thought bitcoin was dead (or going down more) and didn't buy, only to run behind the train later when it was going up again substantially. It's all but easy to buy a bottom. Consider the hope (or fear) of a further drop, for example. Consider the fact that there are reasons for the drop and the "bad press", which you have to overcome.
Also: *When* exactly would you buy? Picking the bottom ain't a simple task. Also: you might just forget about bitcoin because it's not being hyped any more at that point.
But should you manage to do that... congratulations for having the balls.

Ok, let's try to keep ideology and political views from the discussion for now.


I was first going to agree that from a technical perspective Bitcoin would still function. After trying to think about this a bit, I'm not so sure any more. At least I'm not sure it would be able to function in the same way. 
Clearly requiring miners to somehow verify the identity of "agents" within the system (the signers, most likely) is not a problem easily solved in a decentralized manner. 
This leads me to ask a related question:
* Is the possibility of anonymity a necessary result of Bitcoins implementation details (more specifically it's decentralized nature)?
The original question
* "Does the future of cryptocurrency even depend on anonymity"
should probably be more specifically stated as "Does the future of cryptocurrency even depend on the *possibility* of anonymity".
and it's hard to answer scientifically because empirical results are hard to obtain.
Let me try (I haven't got a fully formed opinion yet either) to argument *for* it:
Removing the possibility of anonymity from a cryptocurrency would require some regulation at the mining level, since miners would have to be forced to identify signers of transactions and check with some centralized registration authority the binding of public keys to identities. Once you have regulation at the mining level you can apply force to the miners to also introduce other rules (like for example "keep monetary inflation as high as necessary to keep world unemployment below 10%")  Clearly regulation at the mining level has the potential to destroy core principles of cryptocurrency, namely the way in which protocol rules are governed. As we can see our hypothetical regulators just destroyed the predictability of the currencies inflation and thereby likely the public trust in it. This currency is defunct.
**Therefore the possibility of anonymity is a necessary requirement for a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin to function as intended.**

because people run away after exchange rate drops (coincides with drop in transaction count, right?) and they are disappointed by bitcoin?
I think your last point is correct and I would answer yes to the question:


@_date: 2013-10-04 07:57:07
the significance of SR for bitcoin price had been falling for a long time. When I saw the price drop (overreaction) to $80, I tried to buy, but too late, only managed to buy around $105.
So no, I'm not surprised. But it's good to see nevertheless.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:57:47
Very cool of you to show up here and thanks for your answer.
I agree with your point about cash being harder to trace than Bitcoin,... of course. Cash has limits, though, and we see more regulation to downsize cash transactions.
I have another question: when the inteviewer asked: "Does the future of cryptocurrency even depend on anonymity" you didn't answer this question directly as far as I could tell. You sidestepped by explaining how anonymity in bitcoin was a myth. What would be your answer if you had to answer directly?
I *do* think the possibility of making anonymous transactions ("freedom of economic transaction", "censorship resistance") has a large appeal for many, not just hardcore libertarians and anarchists. People are becoming increasingly sensitive towards control and monitoring, especially when it comes to financials. As the author of bitsofproof (bitcoin tools for the enterprise) said in Amsterdam: corporations want to be able to decide how transparent they want to be with their finances. I doubt they would use cryptocurrency if it would mean all their money flows were suddenly transparent to everybody. So I would tend to say the future of cryptocurrency *does* depend on the possibility for anonymity.
I think, btw, that widespread adoption not of using mixers, but of using [coinjoin]( transactions (where the inputs are owned by different identities) is a possibility (by ways of wallets like the "[darkwallet]( making this very easy to use or even automatic when making transactions). This would of course make clustering of addresses with identical owner much harder because the assumption that all inputs have the same owner doesn't hold to a large enough degree any more.

Derivatives of Bitcoin would most likely not be bad. The "bad derivates" weren't "backed by USD" either. They were based on all sorts of stuff (like bad debt, interest rate swaps, real estate,... who knows what).
What wouldn't have happened with BTC instead of USD had been in use is bailout of banks who screwed up. That would've been healthy and it would probably have avoided the banks being so reckless. This was only possible because the *knew* they wouldn't be allowed to fail.

I think a lot of life remains in that trend: the gold/silver bug crowd, partly thanks to Trace, is only now starting to wrap their tangible heads (facepalm anyone) around the concept and slowly starting to trust the scarcity and longevity of bitcoin and grasp it's tangibility.
Now for **average Joe** and **institutional investors**, I see the 2 adoptions happening in reverse order for gold/silver vs. bitcoin: 
Average Joes are more likely to adopt bitcoin as a store of wealth vehicle than they are likely to jump on the gold/silver wagon, because they are more likely to start using bitcoin for transactional purposes and subsequently discover its fitness as a store of value. This can't happen for gold/silver because these two suck for making transactions, especially online. 
On the other hand gold/silver is already being used by institutional investors, something that will only happen to bitcoin after widespread adoption (for both transactional purposes and store of wealth) that would make the market big enough to even be considered by such investors.

What you suggest is called "arbitrage" and people do it between all bitcoin markets.
The price difference is the result of USD stored at mtGox being worth less (because they take very long to be withdrawn (mtGox apparently has a problems with banks and regulators), and have higher risk of loss attached because of this and because of fear of possible insolvency of mtGox).

In most fiat regimes, putting your money into the bank does even more than just "let the bank invest it". Via a process called "**credit creation**" commercial banks actually generate money (they just book a loan). Depending on the reserve requirement they can create a high multiple of your deposit as loans.
Of course again in your mind, this is probably a good thing (inflation that spurs growth via giving out loans into the economy), right?
So being a little snippy I could ask you: what's better for achieving growth, me spending $1,000 directly into the economy or me putting $1,000 into the bank who then generates $10,000 worth of loans (assuming reserve requirement is 10%) and gives it into the economy?

That's always been like that with Apple products vs. the "rest of the world". They can be really well-polished because software and hardware platform come from one supplier, so everything can be tuned much more easily.
Compared to Android it's a much smaller world and it's under tight control.
It's like back in the days when PC-people had to fight driver issues and hardware incompatibilites while the Mac users had a good laugh with their polished platform and beatifully working (yet overpriced) hardware.
In the end, the open platform wins (although it's debatable how open Android platform really is and it's possible we'll see more open platforms emerge (see ubuntu and others trying to enter mobile market)).

I think this might happen (after we've hit 1,700 or something).
However I don't think you'll manage to buy in at that point due to human psychology. You'll probably think it'll go even lower at that point (the mood will be panic, fear, desperation), hesitate and then buy back in at around $900 on the way back up if you're lucky ;-)
I think this because that's how it's been for me on previous occasions. In fact, I have even been *selling* the lows after the April crash (yes, both of them, but gladly only with a small amount allocated to trading a bit for fun). I know, I shouldn't draw conclusions from myself to others, but I think it might be applicable.

It's not just about you. ;)
Consider how blockchain analysis is done: you can currently make the assumption that all inputs of a transaction belong to the same owner. This assumption is used to cluster addresses that supposedly have a single owner. That's why if you publish one of your addresses, it's most likely possible to (at least over time) find out which other addresses are yours.
CoinJoin transactions are structurally identical to "standard" transactions, but the inputs have different owners. Now if CoinJoin transactions become commonplace, above assumption doesn't hold any more and the result is increased privacy for everyone, even for people who never use CoinJoin-style transactions.
I think "transactional privacy" is a feature of cryptocurrency that makes it more valuable for *everyone*, not just people who have specific needs to hide their money flow. Why? Because the governments and police of the world are becoming monsters that try to monitor and control us increasingly and it's not a good thing. The more Bitcoin transactions are "private by default", the less easily our financial actions can be monitored.

@_date: 2013-08-24 19:30:08
Definitely not. A similar thing happened during/after the 2011 hype with all the gamer kids flooding in and subsequent price drop.
One could hypothesize that the price drop was due to (at least partly) miners "getting out" (selling their gear and maybe also their coins). I remember a lot of those (the majority?) who got in during the 2011 hype were in it for the fiat, so it'd be expected for them to sell any remaining coins together with their rigs when numbers turn red.
Will it happen similarly this time? I doubt it: most miners are probably in for coins and only sell to cover operational cost. Of course a doomsday mood like in late 2011 could change that, but then the reason would be the bad atmosphere, not mining profitability being low.

This is an interesting finding. 
They model the "true believers" as never changing their beliefs and the "traditional believers" as open-minded. At first I thought: wouldn't even 0.1% of true believers be enough in the long run to convert everyone. But that's not true, because traditional believers will "de-convert" already "converted" open-minded people. 
So there is clearly a point at which the amount of "true believers" is able to overwhelm the masses. Seems they found it's 10% independently from network structure.

The things you suggest to add to my portfolio (stocks, bonds, derivatives of stocks) seem very risky to me. All of them

those are things to avoid in times like these.
I *have* diversified into metals, though. In fact I had put more money into the metals than into Bitcoin, but miraculously it's now only a low percentage and I'm in the process of updating that.
In case Bitcoins makes another 10-fold increase I might be tempted to add real estate, but that's a bubble in most places currently and isn't very portable.

interestingly something similar (not a complete switchoff, though) happened to namecoin before it switched to merged mining: after a difficulty drop namecoin mining became profitable again and everyone switched their gear from bitcoin to namecoin. After the subsequent hefty difficulty increase, most people switched back to the now-again profitable bitcoin. I think this effect got greater over time and namecoin had a hard time getting out of that mess.

regardless of wether it will be companies or ambitious individuals, the same thing will happen as in late 2011 with GPU mining becoming less and less profitable: mining will move to low energy cost regions, like the US, China,... 
And you're probably right: mining will be done in large operations rather than small ones because they tend to be more cost-effective.
Just saying: not all companies are big evil corporations... some are quite small, they can be family or individual operations. In germany we call this sector the "Mittelstand" ("small firm sector"). We used to be proud of it thriving here. Unfortunately this sector is shrinking, because of corruption and regulatory hurdles being used by the big corporations (corporatism).
Small firms tend to be more flexible and adaptive (see:  and I'd love to see the sector thrive again, also in the spirit of decentraliziation.

As has been discussed at length in btctalk german subforum regarding taxation of bitcoin capital gains, the blockchain is inadequate as a "paper trail" for anything... for 3 reasons (in order of increasing importance):
* it's way too complicated
* it reveals other info you might not want revealed
* private keys can be bought/sold imported/exported from/to wallets
the last one is the most formal one making any kind of "reporting of ownership transfer" of bitcoins based on blockchain data unusable in court.
For tax declaration purposes however, it's pretty easy to construct a valid paper trail: just use the data from the exchanges you used to buy/sell.

damn regression theorem:


This may have been the case in the past, but *clearly* Bitcoin has somehow managed to get around this requirement and *is* being used as money *today* by a good-sized group of people.
One might even see the "purity" of Bitcoin (nothing backing it, no value other than monetary/speculative) as an advantage. 
Although Mr. Paul doesn't fully understand Bitcoin (he admits himself multiple times), I applaud him for keeping an open mind and welcoming Bitcoin into the currency competition arena.

coinjoin is not a service. It's a type of transaction (that has inputs with different owners). It looks like any other transaction on the blockchain, so  it can't even be spotted.
In addition: if done right (this is still very much in the works it seems to me) the transaction can be assembled without a central server or with one but without it being able to tell which input corresponds to which output, so there's no way to subpoena that info because it simply doesn't exist.
Only way to attack this is to subvert the (supposed) p2p network used for finding peers and assembling a coinjoin transaction to the point where all other parties (except the victim) are the attacker (don't get confused here, law enforcement would be the "attacker" in this case, because they attack the anonymity), so that it is known to the attacker which input belongs to which output and to who those belong (at least ip-address-wise). This is quite similar to how TOR anonymity can be attacked by running many tor nodes. Obviously this attack takes loads of resources to pull off and it'd probably have to be done on a continual basis in order to deanonymize (part of) the transactions.

I have met 5 of them personally. 
They've been involved with Bitcoin for a long time and for the right reasons, mainly freedom of the people and a better world.
In my mind we are at a crossroads in human history. We have a chance to protect and enhance the freedom of the people or we can fuck up big time and end up in some cruel orwellian-style police state.
These guys and this project stand for the fight against that latter option, a fight that must be won... otherwise we and our descendants are going to have to deal with some really bad shit for a really long time.
Bitcoin is part of the solution,... a really big part.
I think it's vital to protect the possibility of privacy in monetary transactions and also to have sound money so people can save and invest in a meaningful way and the economy has reliable price signals to work with and thereby function efficiently.
Bitcoin offers us a huge and easy chance to make it happen. It's very competitive because of the low transaction cost, decentralization, cencorship resistance and anti-fragility. The honey badger of money.
Let's not fuck this up!

When you're rich you want to spend/invest, just as the little guy. You wanna have a yacht, a castle, status symbols,... You're not just going to sit on your stash of coins, that's stupid. Depending on how much you have, you want to change the world or increase your stash, make it even better for your grandchildren, help the poor, have millions of slaves or whatever it is your sick mind desires.
So you will invest and spend. And even if not, you'll pass on your riches to your children, which is (in case you have more than one child) going to be a distributive force in essence.
Just look at goat for example. He bought a fucking lamborghini... just to generate some news apparently (he might drive it, too, I'm not sure). He has a wife, too. I bet she gets to spend some of his coins.

His logic is this: Gold (incl gold ETFs, physical holdings, etc) is worth 1.3trn worldwide. Bitcoin is 5 times as volatile as gold. So the most it can be worth is 300bn (around 1/5 the total of all gold holdings at 1.3trn). **Silver trades for 1/60 of gold.** Bitcoin may become as accepted as silver as a "Store of Value". 1/60 of 300bn = 5bn.
But the value of all silver is more than 1/60th of that of gold, because there is more silver than gold (by a factor of roughly 5), right?

Bitcoin is the first engineered sound money.
**It's a better kind of money than the world has ever seen.**
People have trouble believing that this is true and that Bitcoin (or cryptocurrency in general) will take over the world. 
Because they haven't seen such fundamental change happen before in their lifetimes.
That's why price is still low and also because many haven't even heard of Bitcoin or wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole for various reasons (mainly fear-driven).
That last point is what we need to work on in my mind: make Bitcoin easier, more accessible and less scary to use (for payment, saving and investing). Not (only) in order for us to become millionaires, but for us to be able to live prosperous and meaningful lives in a free world with market access for everyone.
If he who controls the money controls the people, it's probably best if the people control the money themselves.

I think it is.
1.) they put in loads of work. High-level work (crypto, hardware). They're working on this (at least 3 people) since at least the same time last year. Depending on how many they sell, it might not even cover their cost if you count in the work.
2.) How much is it worth for you to finally be able to sleep well at night knowing your bitcoins are safe (while also being accessible). I think it might be worth as much as 5% of your holdings. By that logic, once you own 10 BTC today (tomorrow: 20 BTC), it could be worth it (that's subjective, of course, it certainly is for me)

An incredibly bad idea since this would devalue bitcoin. It's also not easily possible for Mr. Andresen to do this. A majority would have to cooperate.
Even if it's tempting and a majority could potentially be mobilized to seize funds back from the fed by changing protocol rules, I think it's a terrible idea. "Whose funds are these crypto-nerds going to seize next?" is going to be on everyones mind and bitcoins would be worthless quickly.

@_date: 2013-11-19 20:35:50


you are of course correct. I was mainly trying to emphasize the fact that they see Bitcoin mainly as a "payment system" and not as a money. The dangers they see seem also mostly related to fiat and the fiat/btc interfaces, while I think the gravest danger for them should be simply that Bitcoin will take over as a money and remove their ability to "manage the money supply" and in the end severely shrink government and hence endanger their power and standing. (I'm using the term "they" very loosely here)
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:39:23


I don't think they are. I'm not sure about next year, but being able to get cost down from 12% to, let's say, 5% is a huge saving. People will jump on that quicker than you can imagine once it's possible.
All it really needs is reliable local exchangers. Needn't be ATMs, just local shops will be fine.
I think it was Andreas Antonopulous who pulled out some number, I think it was 45 Billion USD (maybe in [this]( video), which is spent on these fees yearly.
Freeing up that money (and the 5% the new kids will get) are a huge incentive and will have great positive impact for those people currently paying them.
Again, his claims are not ridiculous. If Bitcoin remains in the game, this *will* happen. Next year might be too early to beat the establishment, but I can see this process start sooner rather than later, no matter how *old and established* WU is or how many locations they have.
You can probably cover 80% of the market with 20% of the locations. It's also possible you'd see hot-shoes scooting around the cities to deliver money. It'll take time to develop, but not enough for WU/MoneyGram to be able to wait this out and hope Bitcoin will somehow go away in the meantime.

On the bright side this shows the adoption potential bitcoin still has.

There was a talk at the European Bitcoin conference in Amsterdam by some dude whose name I forgot and Vitalik Buterin about the possibility of an efficient simulation of a quantum computation using a classical machine (basically this:  if I understand correctly).
Something about making sure (by introduction of deliberate errors) that quantum state for each qbit remains in some octahedron or something (whereby it should be possible to simulate efficiently) then removing the error at the end (seems it's a new finding that it can be done at the end).
They also said at that point all crypto (except one-time pad and stuff based on &lt;forgot expression/&gt; crypto) would be broken,... including elliptic curve and rsa.
They also said Bitcoin could then also be fixed using this and Vitalik suggested possible ways to do this. However should they succeed, they'd like to mine for a bit first ;).
I don't know sh.t about quantum computing, but maybe we're closer than we think we are if it is indeed possible to simulate a quantum computer using a von Neumann machine.

you can do the math differently: if Bitcoin becomes a complete success  (which is the assumption here), then 1/100th of all bitcoins (210,000 BTC) puts you into the top 100 list for sure. (probably more like top 30)

We primarily need separation of money (supply management) and state.
A state should have to act as fiscally prudent as everyone else. It can tax its people for Christs sake, shouldn't that be enough of a privilege?
While I tend to agree with the anarchists and anarcho-capitalists in here I think that separating state from money would go a long way and be a lot easier to "sell" to the general population than anarchism.
Money is what is used by people as money. In that sense we (the people) have the power to choose our money and thus pull off this separation of money and state.

Then start using these units. There's just no other way.
Bitcoin-QT already allows setting your units to milliBits or whatever, but making it a default would only be a good move when it's already used to at least some extent, which isn't the case.
It would be very powerfull if the exchanges made the move, but it'd be confusing for newbies if they didn't do it all at the same time.

unSpy said it: separation of *money* and state. A state can tax his people, that should be plenty enough to be able to do what it thinks it wants to do. States should be forced to be as fiscally prudent as everyone else has to be. Current states are forcing their people into un-repayable amounts of debt. 
"Public debt"? There's shouldn't even be such a thing.
Oh and yes, onSpy is correct: the time has come to demand honest government by demanding hones money. Actually not *demanding* so much... it's even simpler than that and easier to do by merely *using* honest money.

Correlation does not imply causation.
Bitcoins value is almost solely speculative (as is golds) currently. The little that is needed to support bitcoin payments (method to transfer fiat without chargeback risk (bitpay) or anonymously (silkraod)) would justify a price of about $0.30
On the other hand: more bitcoin-using business mean more bitcoin-aware people, which in turn means more speculative bitcoin-buying. (correlation)

I would hate a "world central bank" controlling that new global fiat money.
If they mean: "stable inelastic money supply", I'm all for it. Let's make a world cryptocoin (the most fitting name is already taken by an existing altcoin, though) or just use one of the existing ones (or a mix, but that's dangerous to stability because politicians might be able to change the mix).

Actually what would happen if this was tried is this: there would be a fork and we'd have 2 Bitcoin chains. One would depreciate in value (the one with the new rule) and the other would continue to thrive (the one where the FBI has control of the coins).

Your numbers are unrealistic. Why assume 10%? That's way too high.
How about 10% (I consider this a very high estimate) of your institutional investors have the balls (and can invest in Bitcoin according to their risk profile or whatever rules they abide by) and they each invest 1% (I consider that a very high estimate), then you'd be looking at 10% * 1% * 2 trillion $ = 2 Billion $.

One of the foundations of the Bitcoin system was actually developed as email spam prevention: proof-of-work. (small work has to be included in every email... not a problem for small amounts, but huge problem for spammers making spamming ineconomical. The problem with such a system is in the roll-out. Imagine you would have to convince everyone who should be able to send you email that he should install a certain client that support POW. I'm not sure your suggestion suffers from the same problem. (if you're talking about a completely new email system that doesn't have to integrate with the existing one, then you'd have much simpler spam-prevention measures available)
I don't quite see how your system is different from simple whitelisting. What do you do when you receive an email from your bank, for example, that doesn't include any amount of bitcoin?
Who would include any amount of bitcoin with an email at all? What's the incentive?

He was talking about your fridge having a bitcoins and having to budget and buy the energy it needs to do its job on the spot market. It would make a payment through the blockchain to buy power. In that sense, the "fridge is on the blockchain", but the fact isn't apparent from looking at the blockchain. Hence, "noone know you're a fridge on the blockchain".

In theory you can do that. In practice it's not that easy: what you propose has 2 severe problems:
1.) tungsten has very similar density as gold. So you have to check for tungsten (or anything of same density) filling
2.) your method of measuring the volume of the metal using that cylinder is very crude. It's also possible and probably much more accurate to measure the weight of water displaced by the piece of metal. I've tried this myself. (See [btctalk thread]( with pix). The results were satisfying to an extent, but it would surely be hard and time-consuming to do with a small amount of metal (I used 1 oz coins).

You don't print bitcoins.
What you *can* do, however, is create a bitcoin private key and it's corresponding address and print these. The private key allows spending of the coins on the corresponding address. You can do so by importing the private key into a suitable software wallet connected to the blockchain (or some online wallet, of course).
EDIT: you can use a service like  to do so. But you should probably use that page offline (save the page as a file and open that in your browser), maybe even on a secure non-connected computer, depending on how bad it would be to lose the coins you'll put on that paper wallet. Same goes for brain wallets.

China officials prove more foresight than those of any other country.
I still can't like them, because they are an oppressive regime and pretty control-freaky towards their own population... something you can increasingly say of western governments, too, though.
It makes sense for them to switch from USD to gold/corporations/natural resources/bitcoin for reserves, because frankly: they have quite a competitive economy going... so no need currently to be able to control the money supply. The productive can only profit from use of sound money in the long run. It protects their hard-earned wealth from the scam that is the USD and other fiat currencies.

**But that seems silly when we remember that Bitcoin has been known to lose more than 90 percent of its value in a matter of weeks.** Whatever virtues Bitcoin has, stability of value is clearly not one of them.
That's utterly stupid. The USD *consistently* loses value. You can count on it. BTC is volatile, yes, but that's something different from losing value in the long run. The author should look at a log-chart of BTC/USD.
The author seems to be trying to induce people to think: "the same amount of value (90%) the USD loses over a century is lost by BTC in just a week", which is simply false and also despicable and unappreciative of the audiences supposed (or not) intellect.

However: those big ones never fail to generate news, so maybe those are good in a way, too.

thanks for digging it up.
The case is pretty clear and it is proven that this was not an address collision. For some reason (a bug, probably), bitcoin-qt gave the user an address that had been used before (by him). And we know it had been used before by *him* and not someone else, because he checked it and the old transaction showed in his records (see post linked below).
So the address was in his keypool all along, just "getnewaddress" gave him an already-used one.
[This post]( explains it.

I can recommend bitcoin.de.
They basically escrow bitcoins until buyer makes a SEPA transfer of the EUR and seller confirms it.
I consider it pretty safe and you'll have a price locked in right away (you take a specific offer) and you'll receive your coins 1-3 days later.
They're also in the process of enabling real-time trading, but only if you have an account (free, I think) with connected fidor bank.

Admittedly that $0.3 I calculated about half a year ago: I took the turnover from silkroads, multiplied by 10 and assumed the bitcoins would be "needed" to make the transaction for about 5 days (I think) until the seller would sell them again for fiat. I came up with $0.25 back then and assumed some growth. 
So basically I pulled it out of my bottom.

**transaction fees** also go to miners as incentive.
Those fees add up (see above link) to already non-negligible amounts.
Miners could also make the space for transactions in blocks artificially scarce and generate competition among people wanting to make transaction to get them into blocks. Of course there might also be miners picking up lower-fee transactions, but transactions with lower fee will take longer to be processed. So fees may well increase.
It's a f(r)ee market.

Mr. Brown has to be politically correct. IBM is selling software to financial institutions, so he can't be pro-black-markets in such an interview. His personal opinion might even differ (although I doubt it)
Note his repeated use of the word "unambiguously" when saying SR shutdown is good. This just means IBM is distancing themselves from such criminal marketplaces in order to not scare their customers.
They might be developing bitcoin-related software for banks, so they're naturally trying to clean up Bitcoins image. Banks just can't be associated even remotely with such criminal stuff (although ironically one could argue at least some of them are criminals themselves).
In that sense yes: the shutdown of SR is "unambiguously a good thing".

Most wallets support setting the transaction fee. (some have it in the settings, like bitcoin-qt (Settings-&gt;Options-&gt;Main in bitcoin-qt), some allow changing it with each transaction (for example electrum))
BTW: The transaction fee is simply the sum of the outputs minus the sum of the inputs of a transaction. It's not stored explicitly. This is how some people hand-crafting transactions manage to accidentally pay a very high fee (they forget to add the change output)

I don't think so.
En contraire, you could argue that higher difficulty creates higher supply (on market), because: miners have operating costs (power, maybe capital) to cover. So if difficulty goes up, they earn less coins while expending the same operational costs, which is in fiat. Ergo they sell more of the mined bitcoins and this puts downward pressure on price.

This is not how it's usually done. You'd have a third party (escrow service) who steps in in the case seller and buyer don't agree. (by using a 2 out of 3 escrow transaction for example, the arbiter can side with either seller or buyer to move the money (less some fee))
Having the money in limbo forever is not a good situation for anyone. If both are stubborn, this will be the outcome, though. That's why you need someone to resolve the conflict in this then hopefully seldom case.

**The candy bar is right below it!!** 
One will learn in not time what 0.003 BTC is worth if that's what you pay for a candy bar every day. There is no better way to learn it.
Have you ever been abroad where there's a different currency used? Very soon you'll know things like: "12 Units of the currency is worth about one espresso.", "pound of butter is about 15", "300 units for a pair of shoes seems a good offer." "A low-budget meal is about 100 units." and you soon stop converting to your own currency.

I think this is good policy. (Can you point out the exact policy that was violated?)
Are they giving you a chance to better yourselves?

There are far better stories related to gambling. For example the one where that guy lost a paper wallet. After coming clean with the loss (BTC 1000), he figured he might as well gamble it all, got lucky (was up to BTC 7000) and then lost it all on a 95% chance all-in bet.

what's your rationale to do this? That's not a good way to do refund, even for "small" amounts (what is small?).
Have users register a refund-address like everyone does.

funny, last night I was looking for an ecig shop that would accept bitcoin. Didn't find yours. I guess shipping to Europe would be prohibitive anyhow, right?

probably down to around $300 or even $250, then oszillate and finally "stabilize" around $450

You need BTC first to sell them. However, if you wanted to push the price down to shake confidence you have some options:
* buy BTC otc (off-exchange, cash deals, person to person bank wire, whatever) not influencing price and sell on exchange pushing price down. rinse and repeat.
* borrow BTC and sell them (aka shorting)
* buy, bribe or somehow force the hand of mtGox to manipulate exchange rate

People need to keep in mind we're using 2013-dollars here. If the fed keeps on increasing it's monetization efforts, we'll be looking at an inflated USD.
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:53:10


I think this might have to be re-evaluated soonish.
The US can print the reserve currency of the world. An exorbitant privilege it is abusing to prop up its economy amongst other things. 
This will not go on forever.

thanks for the kick in the ass. will revisit (looked at OT 2 years ago, but only briefly).
It came back up when I heard a talk by the monetas guys in Amsterdam. In case you know them / what they do: what do you think of them?
@_date: 2013-02-14 10:53:56
and why do you think "real banks" have to be constantly given fresh money? Exactly, because they can't sell the toxic shit that's propping up their books.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:19:24
The banks/govts should fear the people, not the other way around.
I know I'll be branded as naive or delusional, but what the fuck: in the end the people have way more power than those institutions.
Money *is* what *we* use as money.
Those banks/govts screwed up big-time. Now they need us to bail them out. We are *giving* them the power. Let's not do this.
You don't need a tinfoil hat, I think you're correct. They'll put up a huge fight once they realize what hit them (and I bet they are by now). A fight to their death.
I'll try not to fight them, though. Better try to ignore them and keep growing the seed of a better world.

Why is everyone instructing this newbie to use some centralized service like coinbase/bitpay/...? 
**That's not the spirit!**
**Bitcoin is about decentralization, why accept any 3rd party risk?**
My suggestion: use wallet that stores the keys locally (don't put on webserver or anything, but since OP said he's selling on a forum, that's not going to be an issue anyway) and generate a bunch of keys. 
Here's a good intro: 
Get that list of addresses and put them into an excel sheet or whatever so you can track which address was given to which customer. Of course you can also take addresses directly from the wallet and name them with customer id if you like that better.
Easy... and no third party risk.

$5 to $10 is going to take a while. Maybe in 5 years.
There's also trust issues. Would you trust a trezor-copy costing $10 made in China?

I don't think this is correct. There's no better advertisement than a rising price. A lot of my friends have decided to buy the next sizable dip during the rally early this year.
It wasn't me that pointed them to the rally, though, it was the media.

I wouldn't discard gold, it has a long history as a store of wealth.
However, Bitcoin has one huge advantage compared to gold: it can actually be transacted quite easily.
Portability and divisiblity are two of the necessary features for something to be used as money.
Gold isn't very portable and also has divisibility issues. 
Bitcoin is easily divisible and not only *portable*, but even *teleportable*.
Gold can be used as a store of wealth, but it's rather cumbersome to use as a money in transactions. Bitcoin doesn't have that problem: it's both a currency and a transaction network.
Bitcoin is teleportable gold!

thanks for your writeup.
Why do you think it wouldn't work? I don't know much about game theory, but it seems both parties are highly incentivised to find a solution and get a payment done. Isn't that sufficient to make it work?

I disapprove of the government(s) as much as the next guy around here, but this is definitely not a good way.

Max cranking up the bitcoin promo is a damn good sign.
We'll break the ATH and zoom past quite a bit.
