In one of the articles linked from OPs [here]( Charles Stross points out the "Gini" coefficient (from what I gather the concentration of wealth) is very high for Bitcoin. He also states that the currency is highly deflationary. Does this make sense though? If the pockets of bitcoin wealth are only being held as long term investments why wouldn't it become inflationary due to lack of economic activity? To me the biggest risk would rather be bitcoin supply outpacing demand for meaningful (and legal) activity.

That makes it clear, the inflation promotes economic activity. It also occurred to me that Bitcoin has no "Consumer Market Basket" to reference how much more or less a commodity costs, the value right now can only be dependably related to printed money.

I agree, and the Napster metaphor isn't appropriate.

Excellent post, thank you for that. The only thing thats got me confused is how you're using inflation/deflation; Wouldn't a lower exchange value of Bitcoin be an example of Inflation?

From that basis yes it could be superseded by an improved product, the thing I don't agree with is comparing totally different regulatory/legal obstacles, which hamstrung Napster and led to its early demise. That was clearly illegal and the governments goal was to shut it down, meanwhile Bitcoin has promoted adoption and an evolution in government and business (for the longevity of the currency, it seems).
