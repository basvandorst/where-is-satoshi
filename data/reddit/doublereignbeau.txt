I got an email saying:
Your account is limited to depositing or withdrawing digital currency only. Account funding in fiat currency through your bank is not available in your state at this time. This is a restriction on account funding methods only - you are able to trade any of the currency markets we offer and margin trading is also available.
 Your account is designated as a Digital Assets Only Account due to regulatory requirements in your state.

Thanks, I'll look into it. Hopefully I won't get another email telling me they refuse to do business in California.

Thanks, that interpretation makes sense. However, it doesn't change the fact that I am getting emails from the exchange saying they won't do business in my state.

*You must include in gross income in the year of receipt the fair market value of goods or services received from bartering*
Nope.  IRS website says income is the full value of what you barter. I even quoted it in the original post for you to read. Did you not comprehend the quote AND not read the IRS link I provided or are you purposely being illiterate?

Buying bitcoin is sales, sales tax is 9% in California. I included that as well in original post. Spending it is barter. I quoted the IRS. 
EDIT: Included a quote of original post that explains the bartering tax and sales tax. 
**Once for the sale at the initial auction, and TWICE when you spend it due to IRS laws on Bartering.**

Bitcoin isn't treated as fiat by the IRS. I don't know where you are reading that from -  oh wait, you haven't demonstrated any reading comprehension thus far.

Money is a bad example because it can be confiscated by the police without evidence. 
 
 
So a non-money example will be better. Movement of any money above a certain amount is suspect and can be legally confiscated without proof. 
But since it is digital currency we are talking about...  Perhaps the money example is relevant. Your tinfoil hat statement is demonstrating ignorance to actual abuse that is happening in the name of civil forfeiture laws. Legal abuse too.

I would bet that both of us have enough dealings with the government to know that you will probably need an accountant AND a lawyer just to know which taxes to pay and what forms to fill out and if you don't do it in the exact way that the IRS interprets based on NOTHING at all, you will be subject to fines and penalties and taken to collection.
Government side will be anything goes and if it goes wrong, you can fill out a form 420 to wait in line 6 on floor 15 of building 7.

As someone who has the misfortune of having dealt with a lawyer, the legal fees would approach the 200,000 and there would be no guarantee that your assets are protected even so.

*To be criminally culpable under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1), a defendant must conduct or attempt to conduct a financial transaction, knowing that the property involved in the financial transaction represents the proceeds of some unlawful activity, with one of the four specific intents discussed below, and the property must in fact be derived from a specified unlawful activity.*
*§ 1956(a)(1)(B)(i): knowledge that the transaction was designed to conceal or disguise the nature, location, source, ownership or control of proceeds of the specified unlawful activity; or*
Bitcoin is designed to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, AND ownership of the proceeds.
The Bitcoins in question were acquired from Silk Road drug money. So yes, according to the law, they can technically sell you the bitcoins, arrest you for using those bitcoins, and then confiscate the bitcoins and resell them.

The irony is that, despite all the hatred and down votes, you are exactly the ignorant redditer that I need to reach to help enlighten on the horrifying tax consequences. 
No good deed goes unpunished, uninsulted, and undown voted.

*The U.S. government will treat Bitcoin as property for tax purposes, applying rules it uses to govern stocks and barter transactions, the Internal Revenue Service said in its first substantive ruling on the issue.*
You countered without reading the link that disproves your assertion.

Proceeds means gross revenue.
If you trade 400 BTC for $200,000 usd in potatoes, your gross revenue aka proceeds aka income is $200,000 and you will owe 28% federal and 9% state and local tax on it.
Regardless, this will be my last post. I'm getting yelled at for using my phone at work. These burgers won't flip themselves.  J/k

Profit? IRS outright defines barter as exchange without money. They explicitly state you are taxed fair market value on the entire transaction. Can you even read? 
*You must include in gross income in the year of receipt the fair market value of goods or services received from bartering*

I think it may just be using "we" to refer to himself, the reader, and the community. Kind of like how we are communicating right now. We refers to me and you.
