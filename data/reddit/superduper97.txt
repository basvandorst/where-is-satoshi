I had some trouble setting up a SEPA transfer at the start. My account should have automatically been linked when I sent the euro to their account through a SEPA transfer, but it diden't. So I emailed customer support and diden't hear anything back for weeks (surprise surprise). I then found out they had a Twitter support account and messaged them on that, and after a few hours they got back to me and linked the bank account. Transfers work perfect now.

I don't know how other country's student loans work, but here in Scotland we have SAAS (Student Awards Agency for Scotland) Its a goverment agency which gives us monthly payments all the way through university or college and there is 0% interest at the end. You also only pay it back when you earn over a certain amount and only so much percent of your pay check each month goes towards it.
I have used some of this loan to buy bitcoin. I am currently staying at home while studying at university, if I moved away to study this would be being wasted on rent anyway.
In my eyes I don't see the problem in spending a small proportion of my loan on bitcoin.

Whats the diffrence in buying a £1000 TV and buying a £1000 worth of bitcoin through your credit card? People aren't going to buy bitcoin through a credit card if they know they can't make the payments. I have used my credit card multiple times to buy bitcoin and have always paid it back the next month or two. I even have 36 month 0% interest so I can pay it back when ever I want basically. I honestly don't see the problem here, the person  who can't pay back the bitcoin is the same person who can't pay back the TV.
