BREAKING NEWS:  I have been appointed Queen of England in conjunction with this bitcoin event
@_date: 2011-09-07 09:13:20
reality, the truth, being scammed instead of being a scammer, i dunno. trolls are noted for expressing disbeliefs for reactions; i believe everything ive said, and you seem to dislike me for it.
@_date: 2011-06-24 01:12:38
well, while you're holding buttcoins, they appreciate. You're being PAID to hold them! Isnt it awesome!

i'll also add this:

you say value, i say greater fool theory. good luck and be careful

he is -not- quoting where he makes the worst of the statements
this is what he quoted:
this is what he posted:
i think that's enough to say he has some problems on top of being a lying scamster;

so even in worthless money, reddit is 4x better than digg GO REDDIT

i dont think im being inconsistent. this statement:


is all about the treatment of BTC as a commodity and as an investment/speculation/scamming vehicle.  BTC is a shitty commodity. it's possibly a poor currency, but its mostly an underused currency, and thats where it needs to succeed. One cant use BTC as a currency if every asshole out there uses it to speculate or scam people.
given the turd choice between troll and astroturfer, i'll take troll. i dont use or like BTC, but im not just making shit up either.

buttcoin, making fun of bitcoin, is 100 times more trustworthy than bitcoin sites like... onlyone.tv, mybitcoin, mtgox, etc
furthermore, none of this info is in any way related to buttcoin, its all from google searches and such. buttcoin is the tl;dr of "BITCOIN IS ASS DEEP IN SCAMMERS"

i dont have anything against people trying to do honest transactions in BTC. unfortunately, it is rife with scams, crooks, and people who cannot see them.
all you are is an unhappy, witless hater who wants to cover up reality. make me.

what does this have to do with Bitcoin, other than BTC/USD trading crashed worse than the banks?
@_date: 2011-09-16 03:42:29
that'll be 1.1 BTC... no wait, 0.7 BTC, no wait... 12 BTC... 45.... 0.00001.... wait why's our wallet empty?
@_date: 2011-08-12 03:16:15
Crypto-currencies have to have some credibility in the first place; no one in their right mind would flee USD for anything with 1/10th the record of BTC
BTC is in a vacuum unrelated to USD, because the only thing you can do with it is steal it from others

Bruce may -be- Tom. It does implicate Bruce as a scammer of some sort (and gives his response).

i see that you have been in a coma for a month and havent read the recent Bitcoin news. Good luck with the recovery.
@_date: 2011-09-01 21:17:09

i dont know about anything else

what you've seen is morons trying to cobble together an economy from craft glue and boogers (and fail, re: bitomat, dwolla shit, etc) and/or conmen lifting your coins with the greatest of ease.
Bitcoins arent the problem, bitcoin people are
Go ahead and downvote the truth, but feel it in your heart first. you know its the people.
@_date: 2011-09-01 02:37:49
if you sell now, you cant be scammed out of your bitcoins. you're ahead of the other dupes

glad you found a greater fool to hold the bag. good job surviving
@_date: 2011-06-28 08:00:10
if you want bitcoins to survive as currency, sell things for them
if you want to speculate for USD, exchanges
