Bcash has many other issues. And Roger Ver made me hate Bcash.

Buys / sells inside exchanges are not happening on the blockchain. Only when you send BTC from one address to another congests the network.

No one knows. It could take 2 years or 6 months.

You can see Bitcoin distribution here: 
There are actually 969,002 wallets with more than $10,000.

This could be a disaster if something like centralized Ripple takes over Bitcoin. Ripple has zero fees and instant transfers so it is a huge threat to Bitcoin at the moment. We can't let centralized solutions to overtake Bitcoin. We need to make Bitcoin great again and fast!

Twitter doesn't even have a dislike button, so there is no clear way to see what tweets are trash. This is the reason I don't use Twitter.

Satoshi never meant Bitcoin to be an investment commodity. Bitcoin was meant to be a trustless currency with minimal transaction fees.

Media + hype + FOMO pushed the price to bubble territory.

I sold all my Bcash as soon as I could. Bcash is the last crypto I would buy.

As I told in my previous submit: "I sold all my Bcash as soon as I could. Bcash is the last crypto I would buy."

My only problem here is that she didn't really answer to the road map question. There is no release date for LN. Is it gonna take couple months or a year for LN to become available to the public?

Less characters --&gt; less bytes / transaction --&gt; lower fees + more transactions per second?

Everybody please go to : 
and give it 1 star rating. Also write review that it is a scam wallet.

There is no release date for Lightning. It could be 2 years or 6 months away from main net. No one knows.

The "store of value" argument is pretty weak. Why would anyone choose anything digital as a store of value? Bitcoin was meant to be a trustless currency with very low fees, not a store of value. I would hate to see something like centralized ripple overtake Bitcoin but that will happen if LN is not implemented soon.

It became unusable this year.

HODLing is easy for early investors. I know I would be anxious if I bought at 19K and it starts dropping hard.

Could you explain why? It's one of the few trustworthy wallets that have support for SegWit wallets and normal "legacy" wallets.
