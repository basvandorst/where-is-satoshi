Thank you for advice re Bitstamp. Too new to this to trade on margin.
But I looked at Bitstamp on Google maps for their office in the UK. (I'm in the UK, not far away actually.) It is a single story serviced office and does NOT look very professional. Do you have experience of using their Exchange? Positive?

There is nothing on their website that would lead me to believe their reserves get audited. And I looked at their page on  It's 2 guys, each with 100 shares of the company. Companies house says nothing about other share holders. Why do you think those things about the auditing and the money influx? Where did you read it? I'm going to check google and bing right now!

Punters panic. You think like a market trader. I ran a hedge fund with my husband up until 2000 when we bought into another business. And that's the thing, take a position in BTC and formulate a view and stick to it. That said, traders pick a stop when putting a position on so the viewpoint is formed dispassionately and we know what we are willing to lose on a trade. But traders make dispassionate decisions, we don't panic. The next step. How to invest those BTC so your money isn't losing money because it is dormant. Would you be interested in a suggestion?

Another option is the Bitcoin Center of New York at 40 Broad Street. They run open outccry auctions every Monday and Thursday evenings. It is an interesting place to know about.

I don't think it's really that bad. I don't know them so I'm trying some tiny trades, and even though the commission is 1.45% there appears to be no minimum. So if I put 10 dollars worth of my BTC collateral on Google the commission was 14 cents.

This site  has the widest range of stocks available.  Over 250 US stocks plus also stocks from Hong Kong and the UK. And their spreads are very tight.

First Global Credit is the only one that lets you hold bitcoin and places a trade on the exchange on your behalf. I use them because of this feature which means it is LESS likely they will tank someday. They've got futures too which I like because they are cheaper to trade than CFDs in gold, oil, bonds things like that.

First Global lets you keep bitcoins as collateral for the NASDAQ trades.

I would also say that my experience of Xapo is pretty good. Their customer support is a bit slow but most bitcoin-y companies have crapola support. My company has used them for over a year with no real negatives.
