**ELI5** the scaling issue that bitcoin is encountering and the most popular ideas to address it. 
 what is your opinion on the topic and how do you think it will affect BTCC?

Start applying to bitcoin startups. Look up companies that have received any funding and apply to jobs on their site. coinbase, bitpay are big ones, but I'm sure you can find some neat ones in NY.

Any hint on your customer service structure or expansion plans? Obviously you realize the intangible value of great service and how essential it is to your business. Is that highly prioritized at the office? What ways is it demonstrated?

Cannot wait for the world to start tipping. Micro transactions are going to revolutionize the way we interact online. Thanks for your work!

Yeah, the essential part is that *adoption goes up*. Bitcoin could fall and they would still be okay.

Yeah I think what we're beginning to realize is that users need something easy to manage/hold their bitcoins, but what service should they choose? Lots of posts on how to hold your bitcoins; circle/coinbase/blockchain etc. There isn't a perfect answer, but to atleast understand the tradeoffs. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:00:56
Thanks for outlining that, this helps a lot.

Thanks! Love the custom tip name =)

If bitcoin goes up, adoption goes up, the demand for their service rises. It's a network adoption strategy; if there are more businesses accepting bitcion, they win in the future.

1. If you use a payment processor like Bitpay or Coinbase, they will process the transaction for you at the current market price. This takes out the variability for you, and you can have the converted amount in local currency. (No risk in it changing value) 
2. The best way to encourage people to use it would be by providing a cheaper price when paying in Bitcoin. You would pass the cost savings of credit card processing to the user. For example if you usually lose 3% on credit card transactions, offer a 3% discount on bitcoin. Or even 2% and picket the 1% gain. 
3. On your website you can put at the footer an image that you accept Bitcoin. If you Google accept Bitcoin image, you'll find a few great varieties which you can add to marketing materials (website, print, storefront window etc)
 
4. If you go the bitpay or coinbase route, they should assist you with the tax element. If you hypothetically held the bitcoin and sold it later, you would pay tax on the gains. For example you have $100 worth of bitcoin today, but sell it for usd worth $200 tomorrow, you would have capital gains tax of $100. The inverse happens to. If it falls and you convert it would techinally be a reduction in your taxes like a loss in the stock market.

Mr. and Mrs. Nakamoto were incredibly proud to say that they were perfectly normal; they were in a healthy marriage, on great speaking terms with all their relatives, they even owned a hatchback mini-van. Their eldest son, Hamilton was a model child, and recently graduated from Harvard. Yup, everything was all good and dandy, that is of course, except their youngest son Satoshi.
From the beginning, something was different. While other children were sharing toys, **Satoshi sat alone, rolling dice**. It was very apparent after a few years, that Satoshi saw the world uniquely, and to the family's dismay, there wasn't much Mr. or Mrs. Nokamoto could do about it.
Growing up Satoshi would duel with Hamilton. It was extremely hard being in his shadow. No matter what Satoshi achieved, it would just never amount to Hamilton.
In 2008, Satoshi attempted to wire his roomate money for pizza. The payment was declined! He immediately pondered why he even needed a bank. Within a few hours was a new way to transact online without an intermediary, never again would an exchange for pizza go awry. This is when he created Bitcoin. 
After hours of research and programming, Satoshi created a revolution. Over time, the network proved it's worth as others began to experiment and order pizza. 
Six months later he returned home. Approaching his parents, he smiled slightly and said, "Who's the model brother now?"
