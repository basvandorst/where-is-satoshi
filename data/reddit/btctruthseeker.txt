possibly lol.  He REEEEAAALLLLY wants Bitcoin to fail just so he can say 'I told you so'.  He's like that, the authority on everything and right now I'm the moron who invested in a ponzi scheme :P  TO THE MOON!!

We're so close to a mass panic buy on Bitcoin.  It's going to bobble around $700 for another week or two then start gaining crazy momentum.  Once people know "this is it, I'll never get Bitcoin for 3 digits again" we'll see a rush to acquire them.  One week after this we'll see MSM reports of Bitcoin soaring to 4k and beyond.

BWAAAHAAAHAAA!!!  This is too funny.  Oh yes, Krugman completely understands Bitcoin.  He does.  His attacks are in line with all the other pundits out there.  Why in the hell would these clowns say anything positive about Bitcoin?  If Bitcoin succeeds it results in their own demise.  It would be like expecting Taxi drivers to embrace self driving cars.  Ain't gonna happen.  Unfortunately their idiotic games get press and portray Bitcoin as a joke.  Their games will fail.  I think Krugman would make a nice fry cook at McD's.  He should get his resume ready.

I've used Waves Coffee House Bitcoin ATM 16 times now.  Each time everything happened instantaneously. It's been the best BTC experience I've ever had.  -ok in truth I have never used this ATM but it sure is easy to make up shit on the internet right?

My prediction is we'll never see triple digits in Bitcoin again.  Things will hang here for a bit and as Wallstreet scum start dipping in we'll have huge gains.. Hell Wallstreet sociopaths can't wait to manipulate this market.  I guess I won't complain going along for the ride.
@_date: 2013-12-25 03:47:04
blah blah, bitcoin will fail, blah blah, bitcoin isn't 'all that', blah blah, basically I am going to talk shit because if bitcoin DOES succeed I'm out of a frikin' job!

New startups will be looking for bulk amounts of coins and those holding such amounts will be making large private sales.  Think an ATM startup that needs high volumes of coins to be viable, think coinbase and Wallstreet funds wanting to get in on  Bitcoin.

If it gets trolled this heavily, then it must be good.

I wonder what he'll do when Asteroid mining takes off and 1,000's of tons of Gold find their way back to Earth :P

Damn you Apple!  I hate having anything to do with them but I couldn't live without my macbook air.  It runs my entire biz, fliecrypt disk is adequate and time machine is great.  Gaming rig is PC, bitcoin rig is Linux, phone is Android.  But for Desktop my air is the best thing I've ever had.  Sucks they have to be such douche bags.

If you can live off bitcoin only (as proven by a guy at Forbes) then don't cash out.  Live off it.  How could the IRS or anyone else know you have it?

Bitcoin network is now 256 times more powerful than the world's top 500 supercomputers combined.  AND that's a slightly old stat.  I would be amazed if another coin can garner that much power, as well as 100's of millions in VC funding AND adoption that Bitcoin has.  It's kind of like saying, "What's to stop someone from making an email alternative called 'digimail'".  Who would adopt it?  All these current Alt coins don't sit well with me.  It's like "oh damn I missed out on the Bitcoin gold rush, maybe this new coin can bring in the riches!"

I think this is great news, she may have some political influence as well as even convincing Wal-Mart to accept Bitcoin.  Bitcoin needs companies like coinbase and circle to bring it mainstream.

If you want bitcoin for 3 digits better buy now because this is your last chance.  It's on it's way to 4, then 5.  I remember when Google was 2 digits, think it will be 2 digits again?
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:33:21
Very safe prediction, it will hit this easy.
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:26:43
I just hope technology can rip centralization a new Ahole.  My fear is that decentralizing technologies will be squashed with extreme force by these trillion dollar power bases.  These corrupt cartels will not go quietly.  If they win, we are doomed to a life of slavery.
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:09:51
Bitcoin will never be 3 digits again, buy now because it's heading to 3k and beyond (and rapidly)

They use the good intentions of charity as a means to indoctrinate people into their cult.  They destroyed a relatives family, even drove their son to suicide.  I'm not going to get into it in detail but it was pretty insane.  The are also violently homophobic and anti-gay to say the least.  They are like Mother Teresa portraying a saintly image, but peel the onion and it's pure evil.

love this, i watch it way too much lol

A general sense of mass acceptance and adoption.  Increasing market cap.  Richest most influential man is Asia investing in BitPay.  I said at $600 we are well on the way to 4 digits and never again to see 3 digits.  Many can see this after China failed to kill Bitcoin.  People sided with financial pundits who declared Bitcoin dead and now look, still growing exponentially.  People now ignore pundits because they prove again they don't know shit.  Now the race is on to get Bitcoin at it's last triple digit price ever.

Trolls: your money is already gone, bitcoin is dead
  
Fans: to the moon!
