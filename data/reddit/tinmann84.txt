I searched the address I generated. It shows "0 transactions" and "0 BTC received"

Currently using hardware wallets and understand running my own node is the next step in security/freedom. Can i possibly screw up setting up my own node so badly I lose my sweet sweet BTC? Am I more susceptible to being hacked if I'm running my own node rather than what I'm doing now with just the hardware wallets? 
For what it's worth, I only hodl. Was thinking about a Casa since im not to confident in my own abilities if I do pull the trigger on one.

When I look at the transaction on CoinbasePro under my withdrawals,  there is no "transaction hash" listed as there is for previous transactions.

what happens if ISP's limit the amount of internet usage like has previously been proposed? would this not significantly reduce the number of people using nodes, miners, etc?

Gentlemen, its been an honor serving with you. 
When I started buying BTC in October 2017, I looked at it much like George Washington in pledging not so much my life but my sacred fortune. Ive put my whole savings on the line (against others soundadvice) to stick it to the oppressive regimes ruling us. I havent sold a single satoshi and I like many of you have been hit hard. 
Im not sure whats happening but it doesnt look good. That being said im not selling and will not sell. Im simply disconnecting for a while.
Godspeed.
