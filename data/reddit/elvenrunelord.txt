Maybe it is about time we all say we don't give a "DAMN" what anyone in the government thinks about the things we create for ourselves. It's just not their business.

I think a more important benefit would be the ability to avoid foreign interference with a nation state's economy and financial transactions.
No gold to seize. No centralized banking institutions to force into freezing assets.

Always assume a nation state could become interested in you. Because it could happen. The less your government, or any government or corporation, can learn about you, the better you are.

What I find funnier is that the day will come when the very same headlines will be used to talk about Bitcoin.
It is just as fiat as any other currency.
@_date: 2019-02-09 04:01:03
So essentially we get a different bunch of 100 people who get to lord it over us all.
Not interested.
@_date: 2019-02-09 07:57:24
Actually we have a lot of choices. Bitcoin is not the only player and frankly not even the best player on the field.
100 people own a huge majority of bitcoin. I see no difference in that than I do with the other fiat currencies in circulation today.

The most likely reason Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptos we currently have won't work out is nation states develop their own cryptos and outlaw the use of cryptos not under the direct control of nation states.
This has a 99.9% chance of happening.
I'll get downvoted to hell for saying this because as you said, most here are bullish on Bitcoin. While the tech has its uses, its ability to be used as a monetary instrument up until now and into the future depends on the good will and acceptance by nation states. Some these crypto warriors think they got something over on the governments of the world but right now all the governments are doing is sitting back and watching.
If and when they want to put a stop to this little experiment all they have to do is make it illegal to use the cryptos to engage in trade.
BAM, 99.9% of businesses will not accept them and the monetary reason for their existence is pretty much GONE.
End of story.

Inflation is already doing this.
All this would do is create a demand for torches, pitchforks, and banker's heads.

We as consumers have no obligation to prop up companies than cannot compete or are sidelined due to better customer service or a better product.

You are assuming that the majority give a shit what "experts" say anymore. I own crypto currencies and I also own a 3d printer.
I have not used it to make a gun yet but I could if I wanted too. That is my right.
Yes, I'm one of those goddamn "shall not be infringed" patriots.
You can buy drugs next door with USD easier than you can with crypto and be more assured that is is not a sting than you can using crypto over the net.
Bloody idiots in this world now, they don't bother to think through a goddamn thing

I agree 100%. I think the future of a free internet depends on decentralization, anonymity, and privacy. Censorship proof and encryption are essential as well.
Does this mean nation states will have less power over our lives?
Fuck yea, that's just a side benefit.

I think it might actually be a black swan event for some. In particular those who would choose to their economic power to shove their social and ideological ideas down the throat of others.
A good example of exactly this is the decision by Citibank to not deal with certain companies involving firearms. Frankly, they are a payment processor and I insist they be agnostic toward any legal item I decide to purchase. Especially considering they and other banks and financial institutions are so cozy with government. Seems to me they should be limited in the same way that government is. Shall not be infringed is pretty clear and legally any user of their services should be able to purchase any gun product they so desire without having to worry about citibank's ideological malfunctions.
As an investor, I'm horrified as to what such moral choices will do to the longterm value of my investment although cryptos and smart contracts are going to make much of their services irrelevant far sooner than anyone expects in my opinion.
Black swan event? For some yes and I strongly agree with what a Chinese official said in that Bitcoin or rather the underlying technology of it is bringing freedom to the individual regarding finance.
With that said, even more privacy intensive coins need to be considered due to state actors progress on unanonymizing bitcoin transactions is troubling for the very reasons pertaining to that freedom the Chinese official was speaking of.
I have spoken with many people who regard my skepticism regarding the state actors of the world and their benevolence. Perhaps it is youth speaking but us who have seen the test of time regard you trusting ones as fools. I have never trusted governments, experts, and big business less than I have today and that distrust will grow tomorrow. One only has to look at the news to see why if one has open eyes.
Every day I see yet another reason as to why privacy ensuring technologies become more and more a necessity rather than a want in our society. its not that I have anything to hide, its that I have a growing number of compelling and relevant reasons not to share.
Even here on Reddit we are seeing more and more censorship that is having a chilling effect on certain discussions and bodies of information exchange. I see it as in inevitable conclusion that those who choose uncensorable conversation will have to adopt a block chain distributed platform with unalterable previous blocks to prevent other actors desires to censor the inalienable rights of individuals to speak about and as they wish.
Another black swan event for another group of bastards I have no sympathy for.

This is EXACTLY why it needs to remain a public service, because a public service can offer goods and services to people who are NEVER going to be a profit maker to them.

And that should be your right because NO one here in America ever asked the Federal government to step in to the weed industry except the cotton industry back in the early 1900's.
And why in the hell are my rights to consume something I want to consume being violated just to prop up some batshit industry in competition with another industry?
I need the government to keep from from trading sad NO ONE EVER!

So I downloaded this dissenter browser and can't figure out how to set it up where the ads I let through will actually pay me bitcoin. I see no way of entering a bitcoin address or anything like that.
Is this coming in future features or something?
