I have absolutely no plans to become a terrorism-stopper - that is delusional thinking. Terrorism is an idea as old as the human race - to think that you can stop something that no other generation has been able to borders on insanity. The only way terrorism can be stopped, ironically maybe, is to have the most widespread act of terrorism - stripping everyone of any sort of personal freedom. The trade off is simply not worth it, and, if we're being honest, not possible.
You can't fight an idea. All you can do is be a decent person and not do the types of things you fear the terrorists are doing.

What makes you think we can stop terrorism at all, even if we take it "seriously"? As long as human beings have any degree of freedom, terrorism is a possibility - thats the nature of freedom. There has never been a time, nor will there ever be a time when some people won't use violence &amp; fear against others to advance their agenda. If everyone in the world took this as seriously as they possibly could, some nutbag would still figure out how to kill an innocent person with nothing fancier than a plastic knife found on the ground outside a McDonalds.
(Some) people suck, no matter how seriously we don't want them to. Others don't. Choose wisely.
Also, I'm not arguing against anti-terrorism tactics - just a more rational sense of whats important to focus on before you die, which you will one day, one way or another, and for the vast majority of us - NOT in a terrorist incident (odds are something like 20,000,000 to 1).

Sure, thats the way you were using the word, but we are talking about how the US is "investigating" bitcoin's potential use in terrorism - when the US says terrorism it can cover the spectrum from whistleblower to neo-nazi group to peace activist. Some "terrorists" aren't really Terrorists, in other words. In fact thats a major problem with this topic - its just words. Check out some actual statistics on the number of terrorist incidents - the threat is there, sure, but a person living in the US has a much higher chance of being killed in a traffic accident than by a terrorist's hands.
Again, I have no problem with anti-terrorism tactics to prevent terrorist activity - WITHIN REASON. Another problem with this whole topic is how quickly reason gives way to fear and paranoia.

Yeah, there are plenty of faucets out there - if you're committed you can maybe make $1-$2/week - but thats doing them around the clock. There's a site that gives &amp; lets you bet like 0.00000450 BTC every hour - so theoretically you'd be able to bet your way up to multiples of that. Good luck!

You keep saying its anonymous, but its pseudonymous.
Also, I would take your contentions a lot more seriously if the world had a FIXED definition for TERRORIST. The authorities seem to be inching the definition more &amp; more to people who have anything negative to say about the government as opposed to those that actually commit acts of violence in support of their beliefs. TERRORIST and TERRORISM have become politically-charged trigger words to induce fear &amp; misplaced patriotism.
That said, bitcoin does not discriminate. Its a tool. Tools are neutral. People are not.

As long as people's perception matters, the value matters - its the only thing about Bitcoin that is visible in the general public's eye.

Its so strange what we choose to 'like' when we're forced to.
