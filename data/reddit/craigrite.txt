One argument for game theory and being extra safe, you should never sell a fork. Anyone who says they can predict consensus is lying.
Unless they support BitcoinBoy, which will obviously hit $5,000,000 by 2020.

Heard about it in 2009 wow. Were you in the original mailing list?
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:45:39
I agree. I’ve heard some ideas of “opting in” to pay taxes. If you want to use a State maintained highway they might ask for micro-transactions.
It will be a lot to figure out.

There’s a lot of spamming on Bitcointalk now. I know it gets hate but Twitter is actually pretty good. Crypto Twitter has a good mix of high level conversation and memes.

Price is boring. You must be new.
Real crypto users read BIP proposals all day and do drugs and only eat meat and only sell 200 years from now

Now that you say it like that, I guess it is just rambling words, fact less, offering literally nothing of value in anything said.
A shitpost basically.

If you’re looking for some further reading on Bitcoin production and when it ends.
The truth is no one knows how it will work exactly once all Bitcoin are mined. Fees will continue to pay miners but obviously the incentives will be different.

I prefer long schitzo posts over price predictions or linking to a twitter post. At least the guy is using his brain.

This is all great advice, taking the time to work through those sources will put you ahead of most people.
The only thing I’d clarify is that Bitcoin.com isn’t a full-on scam, but it has an obvious agenda pushing the altcoin Bitcoin Cash.

POW mining arguably “wastes” resources as computers solve complex problems for the sake of being complex. Couple directions you could go in... just some thoughts to get you thinking:
1) Could we direct mining power towards big research projects like protein mapping, running AI programs, or SETI?
2) Will remote areas of the world now have a reason to build power plants, as mining could be a way for the people to make money?
3) How the history of Bitcoin mining (from CPU, GPU, to ASICs) shows innovation through competition, and how it impacts tech in completely unrelated fields.

If you’re looking for a video I like this one (not mine by the way).
From 2013 and it still holds up!

Always consider the motivation behind posts... OP looks like a burner account, probably someone who wants drama, maybe even false flag.

There is a lot of material out there, and what will become apparent is that some people are trying to swindle you. My advice would be to always judge the source before blindly accepting the information as correct.
A pretty good collection of information if interested-
@_date: 2019-04-27 03:15:13
Don't dwell too hard. There really wasn't educational material out back then. Even cypherpunk emails didn't always articulate things well or even correctly.
@_date: 2019-05-31 02:28:04
IMO it shouldn’t be a question until we see all-time highs.
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:03:05
Especially today with all the educational material out there.
One of the ways I cope with not investing earlier was that there wasn’t a lot of easily digestible info. at the beginning.

If you’re looking for another rabbit hole to explore, sea-steading also has potential for decentralized nations.
If we get enough people interested in starting fresh in international waters, Bitcoin would be the perfect national currency.

Many people have heard of Bitcoin, but I think few have looked into it enough to buy some.
Also I think the number of people who understand it’s both a technical and social innovation is extremely small.

The only reason miners are honest in is because they receive the reward.
What incentivizes a node?
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:22:10
Right. We need miners to add blocks, and we need competition for added security.
@_date: 2019-05-20 18:39:26
You will see many projects have higher/lower gains than BTC if you change around the time frame.
Good decisions can only be made with a lot of information. I would recommend learning why people value different projects, and what impacts market cap.

Lightning is a small percentage of transactions currently. 
I’m just thinking when (or if) we get to the point where 50% or 90% of transactions are on layer 2.
