You don't have enough capitol to make enough of a profit for it to be worth it with the fees.

Because if it's for a game, a comic or another for-profit project, the most normal response should be "Fuck you. Pay me." (worded politer, though that goes without saying).


"We don't have the budget for 20 sprite-sheets, but we'll sell this game and your name will be in the credits!" -- Fuck you. Pay me.
"We need 10 sprites / full paintings by tomorrow, for free please!" -- Fuck you. Pay me.

This seems like a scam AND a way to get free work out of designers.

Taxing homeowners on their primary home is immoral because of situations people have no control over, and especially for those with little or no income. As in: widowed with 4 children. 
Taxes on auxiliary property however, property one does not directly live or work on (as in where the owner physically works, not where the owner's employees work), should be sky high. If a person owns 100 houses, s/he should be taxed at a much much higher rate than an owner of a single house to insure s/he is utilizing the land instead of just hoarding it. 
Same with farms, factories, and any land. This would insure the maximum amount of land use and the minimum amount of hoarding.

Land title is backed by the threat of violence from the state if anyone infringes on it. 
Bitcoin is backed by understanding the risks and the ability to pick a secure enough password (and not lose it). 
You own both, the mechanism for security is just different between the two. You pay a fee for the security of owning your land, you don't pay anything to spend/recieve bitcoin (unless you exchange it).

Hacker seems to be used as a term for anyone who codes outside of a corporate setting for a non-job reason.
