...its kinda funny, plus her mother is saving her money for college.  So I can't hate it.

It only needs a 12/12 or 10/14 lighting cycle to force flowering.  Its been years, I forget which...
They can and do grow well (and fast!) Under 24 hour light.  But unless you have a sativa (damnit *cannabis*. I musta been high...) ruderalis hybrid it won't flower. (Aka autoflowering)
Most do 24 hour light until they are mature, then switch to force it to flower.

Ive never been able to get anything other than a basic server install to work.
I might try again relatively soon though

which amuses me, since for developing, Apple seems to be way behind...
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:49:35
Because that definitely the only developing that exists.

No but I can imbibe sugary drinks and yoghurt and other things.
It doesnt have to be a meal.  Just something

*Glances around*
I too hate dogecoins. They are destined to fail.  Something something meme stupid something.
It would figuratively be the worst thing ever if I were somehow to gain a small piece of one.

If you don't, I'd like them.
But if you want them, then keep em.

I bought a Roomba.
I named her Rosie.

I found the Gox employee!
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:46:40
It documents the "bug"
@_date: 2014-02-01 05:47:28
...I don't have a dog, so I'll let you know if I ever get one.
@_date: 2014-02-02 09:08:45
Which will let me get wikipedia, coursera, potentially YouTube.
And how many of those can I get now?
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:42:43
Dude, I'd be thrilled to get godecoin or litecoins.  *thrilled*.
Also I blame autocorrect, and I'm keeping it that way.

On my phone smartass.  Limited to GPRS speeds at my house, and or 15 gigs per month, no streaming.

DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO?  CAUSE I SURE AS HELL DON'T

Extasy is one of the drugs that pushes you beyond your limit if you let it.
Which is not much different than a challenging workout or mental puzzle.  If you remain hydrated,  keep your blood sugar up by eating, and don't dance for hours at a time you wont really notice the comedown.
If you don't do these things, you'll feel like shit afterwards because you pushed yourself too hard.

What local ISP? You mean the one I don't have?
Don't shit on my one chance for decent internet
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:43:56
...damn you
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:53:16
Its not really a bug I don't think.
Maybe a badly thought out feature at worst.
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:13:12
Ok im curious. 
Troll test
(6 minutes.   Nothing.
I'm disappointed)
(13 minutes.  I feel so left out.  Somebody downvote me pls...)

PUNY MORTAL, GIVE GRABNOCK THE DESTROYER YOUR DOGES, LEST YOU FACE MY WRATH.

If they did, we'd fork the block chain and put everyone's money back.
Then since they are on a separate chain that is valid to only them, they effectively wouldn't have any bitcoin anymore

I bought a 2500$ computer with 20$ worth of coins (when I bought them)
I still have over half of mine left.
Pleased would be an understatement.

"Best modern UNIX"
Yeah no.  Its not as good at many many things as Linux, BSD, etc.
I'll freely admit that and I literally just bought one.
There's a reason most servers are Linux.
