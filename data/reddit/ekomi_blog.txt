The next decade is going to be an exciting time for Blockchain, Smiguelito. Right now, the technology is not even close to being as advanced as it will be in just a few years. What are some of your biggest concerns regarding Blockchain?

You have every right to question the use of blockchain technology, Darkstarman. Especially regarding the use of the technology within powerful banks. Have you looked at this presentation by Goldman Sachs that I hyperlinked within the article? Initially, I found it especially incredible that a company such as Goldman Sachs would present the disrupting technology in such an accepting and appealing way. What are your thoughts?

Thank you for commenting! I would love to hear more about your opinion. Perhaps, what are some of your personal concerns about having your bank use Blockchain technology? Care to explain further? :)

These are all great points, and I am happy you took the time to explain. The future is filled with uncertainty and risks, so you have every right to be skeptical of the banks incorporating Blockchain technology within their services. I am excited to see how blockchain will evolve, and how the powerful banks plan to address these issues and concerns.
