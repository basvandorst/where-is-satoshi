Coinbase is fine. HODLers and core supporters're mad, beacause coinbase added bcash and segwit (that doesn't help a lot in terms of transactions costs) ain't implemented yet.
As always, when bitcoin network is stuck, everyone else is guilty, but not bitcoin network (and developers that don't care about that).

What adoption? Adoption in speculation? Almost nobody is using bitcoin, it's pure speculation. 
What BTC chart looks like? First or second case?

Think so. Installed linux, a lot better for bitcoin's safety.

How can i check it?

Dunno scanned it with Kaspersky and spybot - seems to be clean. Regarding to viruses i'm very awake - if i find some virus on my PC, i'll simply reinstall it ASAP, even if it was neutralized by my anti-virus.
It was downloaded from official site, bitcoin.org. Could You please check if it's the same? Scan page is virustotal.com

SHA256 key is the same, and it does have 'the bitcoin funcation, inc.' certificate in properties. Looks safe.
