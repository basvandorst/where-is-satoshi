The first point is that we need bitcoin forks to experiment with different approaches. It would be unthinkable that the next breakthrough would come from the bitcoin core team itself. Since we do not wish to put a halt to innovation, we should encourage new coins doing something in a different way from bitcoin.
The second point is that altcoins are excellent tools to anonymize bitcoins. Just buy altcoins with bitcoins and then sell them back for bitcoins. It is the very existence of altcoins that allows this trade; and this trade is certainly useful.

It's not about dying but about showing that you are willing to take a very serious risk for what you believe in. Talk is cheap. Show some proof-of-work!

When people store their coins in centralized online wallets and lose them, it is a disaster for them, but it also creates downwards pressure on bitcoin's value for us. What is so hard in using your own wallet on your own device while backing up the HD seed somewhere safe? When will people finally stop storing their coins in centralized online wallets?

Other people should pay tax. Other people should move to a shit hole ... There is only one solution to this problem. You should be forced to prove that you are willing to risk your life and die for what you believe in.

He is badly misguided about morality. Taxation is the result of man-made law and can therefore never have any valid moral implications.
In fact, it is the other way around: voluntarily agreeing to man-made law and therefore in that way accepting a second master next to or even above the only legitimate one, is a pagan depravity. In that sense, avoiding taxation, and refusing to pay to the impostors, are acts of faith.
Every truly monotheist faith subscribes to this view.
That is also why the man-made-law pagans are now at war with Islam, one of the large monotheist faiths.
Of course, it is much more attractive to believe, just like the Muslims do, that you owe nothing to the impostors. The opposite can obviously only be a false belief.
As we told the pagans already about their ongoing conflict with the Muslims: the pagans can impossibly win, because their pagan beliefs are simply false. Why are their beliefs so unattractive? Because they are false! Seriously, we don't owe anything to the impostors.

MVC assumes that the entire live process will be running on one machine. If it will be running on two or more machines, the architecture does not make sense.

I did not say that the only valid application of bittorrent is the distribution of illegal files. It is the other way around. If you want to distribute illegal files, you will have to use something like bittorrent.

localbitcoins (lbc) has one unsolved problem: proof of fiat payment. Hence, the entire lbc system rests on reputation. It assumes that a reputable member will not claim that he has paid his fiat obligations when in reality he didn't, and that he will not refuse to acknowledge that he received a fiat payment when in reality he did. How does lbc mediate in disputes that can only be solved by providing proof of fiat payment? The truth is that they can't.

How do they solve the problem of proof of fiat payment? The banks will never, ever provide it. Seriously, a fiat bank will never, ever provide you with a cryptographically signed statement in which they confirm that you have paid. Therefore, the payer of fiat cash can simply never prove that he has paid. In a decentralized platform a fiat bank payment is unusable, because it is unprovable. I assume that bitshares must have some way to verify that someone has truly made his fiat payment, without the cooperation of the fiat banks. One simplistic way is to centralize the fiat payments, but that means that the fiat banks will take control over the platform, and arbitrarily shut down the platform's accounts or impose KYC/AML. That explains why all centralized bitcoin exchanges always morph into minions of the fiat banking system.

True, the code is indeed the hard part. It is a lot of work. I would certainly not be able to finish it all alone in a reasonable timeframe. I don't want to be coding it until the year 2025, at night, after my day job. Therefore, yes, it would require a team.

What exactly happened? There are no witnesses. What we have is the Mt.Gox databases, the transaction history on his fiat bank accounts, and the blockchain. Who has enough experience and expertise to reconstruct anything from that? If no criminal charges can be proved from that mess, he will simply be acquitted.

A DDoS will not destroy the trust of the public in ATMs. Trust is a complex substance.

Homeless people usually have a phone. They  just do not have a house, a flat, or another acceptable place to stay. Of course, this is as much a social problem as an economical one, because, in a more normal case, people should be able to stay with relatives until they recover from their predicament. Therefore, the problem is also the result of rampant individualism. Bitcoin is an excellent solution to prevent the fiat banks from exacerbating existing social problems or unduly excluding even more people from normal social life.

The treaty basically says that a law on speeding must disclose the speed limit. The driver must be able to know when he breaks the law. If this is not possible, it is not law.
