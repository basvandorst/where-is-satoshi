We're a non-profit, hosting Miami's first ever bitcoin hackathon:  :-)
@_date: 2014-04-15 18:17:56
There's quite a few youtube videos of him out there and I can't recall the exact one but it's definitely out there. I've seen it myself plus it's been mentioned/confirmed in other professor bitcorn related posts on this subreddit.
@_date: 2014-01-26 01:41:33
They're also giving away these two other tshirts for free:  but only XL and 2XL sizes are left and bitcoin magazine is only $5 each but they only have these 3 issues left. If any of you would like this stuff, let me know as I'll be back at the conference tomorrow. To show my respect and love for this community, I'll get this stuff for you and only charge shipping or the $5 per magazine plus shipping cost.
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:32:51
Cool and yeah, that's why I through this out there because I wanted to gauge interest of this subreddit and see if others agree with me. I'll donate as well. I actually met him once at a completely unrelated event, a life extension conference. He's known for his work in nanotech as well and that has connections to life extension / cryonics. I'll make some attempts to get in touch with him and see if he's even aware of bitcoin plus if he's interested in setting up a wallet for this purpose of receiving donations.
@_date: 2014-01-15 04:31:26
Thanks for the info nonetheless guys, what did mybitcoin do with the bitcoins in the web wallets there? I'm assuming as radiohead once said in lyrics... "take the money, run" lol?
@_date: 2014-04-15 20:32:31
 but to most of us he's affectionately known as "Professor bitCORN" :-)
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:33:37
yep, saw that earlier but just think it would be cool if some tipping could be done directly to individuals involved with the mission
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:01:19
It's actually the weekend right before and was planned this way so that the winners could receive recognition on stage at the conference itself :-)

Imagine how this could affect pirate history: Merchants wouldn't have to risk sending gold overseas on a treacherous journey in exchange for some goods...
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:54:12
Perhaps in the original timeline of history, Satoshi became the wealthiest man ever and thus the first to afford financing the time machine. He then went back in time and took all the necessary steps to ensure that his identity would never be discovered.
@_date: 2014-12-24 15:31:28
Hi, I'm Peter from Blockchain Beach (the non-profit organization which is hosting the hackathon). Just wanted to let you know that if you don't find team members by the time of the event, the Friday (January 9th) evening welcome reception will be a mixer of sorts which will definitely give you the opportunity to find team members. Thanks for your interest and participation in the event, let me know if you have any other questions/concerns, we're here to help :-)
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:51:10
Yeah, I'm just posting it for fun to see what others say and just to give us something to do if we're already caught up on other news and all. Kind of disappointing though to see the downvotes outweighing the upvotes, this post would probably do better in the dogecoin subreddit which doesn't taking things as seriously as our bitcoin one :-/

@_date: 2014-04-15 17:32:33
The craziest part is that he admittedly owns some bitcoin. Makes me think that he just does this to try to depress the price for as long as possible to acquire more bitcoin, lol.
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:38:54
We're working tirelessly day and night to bring bitcoin to Miami in every way possible. We're the same group of individuals who created the world's first ever physical bitcoin faucet and bitcoin-enabled art gallery as an experimental project during Art Basel Miami: 
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:57:27
Because I've spread awareness of bitcoin to more people in Miami than anyone else I know (You can review my previous posts to get an idea / proof of this). If I receive this amount from you, I'll divide it into about 10 equal units, then post on my facebook that I'm giving away free bitcoin to anyone who signs up a new web wallet for the first time and reviews some bitcoin 101 info to really grasp the concept. I'll link you to my facebook post and you'll be able to see the comment chain that is set off and my bitcoin education at work.
My facebook profile is:  and if you review it you'll see that I've posted relentlessly about bitcoin for the past 4 months or so since I became passionate over it.
@_date: 2014-12-26 08:15:12
Talk about "being late to the party", calling bitcoin a scam just before NYE 2015 is over one year late from the last days when people did this in like mid to late 2013, lol
@_date: 2014-09-27 12:45:33
I have two houses near Miami's popular Wynwood Arts District for rent in exchange for bitcoin if anyone is interested
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:43:45
I'm not saying that he owes it to us to do this. I'm just saying it would be interesting to offer it and then see his response.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:41:55
Yes, my bad, I should've specified last day to donate towards the initial lump sum that's going to be presented to him. I'm curious to see what his reaction will be...
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:43:42
I just updated the description to reflect what you pointed out :-)
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:14:18
He's not doing well financially at all and has to take care of his 93 year old mother. He was also rather cool about the whole fiasco that Newsweek caused and he could've easily extorted them or any other journalist for the exclusive rights to his story (whether or not he was Satoshi, simply charge them just for the exclusive answer) yet he didn't. Lastly, the delivery of these donations to him is good press for our bitcoin community just like all the other causes we've donated to. I do agree with you though on the point that at times the bitcoin subreddit could donate to other causes that are more worthwhile. For example, Sean's Outpost is doing great work and I'm all for helping out the homeless (mainly provide them help that then allows them to help themselves) but I am surprised that I never hear about us donating to something like aiding children with cancer for example.
@_date: 2014-12-14 22:15:41
Thank you :-) Much appreciated :-)
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:28:32
Congrats! :-)
@_date: 2014-03-19 21:06:45
Thanks and yeah, I just sent him an introductory email to see what he knows about bitcoin and to see if he's cool with us sending him some for his great contributions. We should also use this thread to identify/recognize others who contributed to core underlying technologies of bitcoin.

I just checked the egifter site but don't see any gas station options :-/

maybe it's possible to send bitcoin from my circle to a prepaid visa she gets if I link that prepaid card to my circle account, it's a longshot but maybe. I can't give her the cash before she leaves cause she's coming to me, she's in Valdosta, GA and I'm in Miami, FL :-/

Myself and three other good gentlemen have co-founded Bitstop.co in Miami and we're working towards being the first to deploy bitcoin ATMs down here. We're also working to do tons of educational outreach and we do creative projects like the world's first ever physical bitcoin faucet and first ever bitcoin-enabled art gallery for tipping artists via qr codes next to their paintings. Here are some pics from our most recent event which showcased all of this: 
@_date: 2014-01-01 01:08:51
Miami is pretty sweet right now. Our Wynwood Arts District which used to be nothing more than a run down warehouse neighborhood is now quite vibrant and very successful during Art Basel. The tech/entrepreneurial scene is booming too with lots of coworking facilities and cool startup companies from Brickell to Midtown. As far as bitcoin goes, we've got a great community for that down here too and in fact we're hosting this in January:  :-)
@_date: 2014-01-01 00:45:27
Miami and that's downtown Miami in the background, in particular you can see that blueish building there which used to be the old Bacardi HQ and further behind it is the freedom tower :-)
@_date: 2014-01-26 03:55:11
I didn't use it as I didn't really need to but I watched others do so and it was pretty nice, decent UI/UX etc.
@_date: 2014-12-14 23:31:48
Excellent :-) Wynwood is indeed a great place for all of this to catalyze. The area began as and still is a major arts district but the tech scene has totally moved in and it's all coming together so perfectly. Join us at our bitcoin meetups at Brick House in Wynwood every 3 weeks or so, search for the bitcoin meetup on meetup.com :-)
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:35:01
I'll be there :-)
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:32:19
This is not new news though, they've been accepting bitcoin for over 9 months now. I've spent about 2 BTC there over the past few months on drinks and food, it's been a great experience :-)
@_date: 2014-12-03 08:46:12
"The arms race to earn more bitcoin block rewards in the late 1800s led to the rapid development of computers in order to complete proof of work at a  faster-than-human rate. By the mid 20th century, desktop home computers were operating at terahertz speeds but still limited to dialup modem speeds as CPU technology had progressed much faster than communications technology."

I've been working with JS since the 90s and I'm actually diving deep into Angular myself now, I'm focusing on 1.3.x/1.4.x since it's still too early to use 2.x in any sort of production environment. I'm using it in conjunction with cordova/ionic o produce not only web apps for the browser but hybrid apps for mobile devices as well. My current challenges revolve around how to best organize my projects as they go large scale. It's easy to do little atomic proof of concepts / prototypes but the real mastery of framework is when you can do a real deal large scale app with it. Hit me up if you ever want to work on this together, if you're looking for angular in depth and not just the basics, then we might actually be on the same level and interested in mastering the same concepts.

Not quite LA but they will be showing off one of these unit in Vegas when they travel to the bitcoin conference there
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:36:12
So these will likely be liquidated at auction to a private buyer, likely driving up the price and increased publicity for bitcoin in general
@_date: 2014-10-02 01:53:48
Yep, this seems like perhaps the best and only option. Thanks to everyone who replied, I appreciate all the ideas :-)
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:15:24
We thought that bitcoin technology would be the solution to moving money around, but really it's exoskeleton tech
@_date: 2014-12-14 22:55:54
Cool idea and indeed totally doable via technology. The physical faucet thing got me thinking a lot. I thought of ideas like faucet networks serving the homeless who can in some way provide "proof of hardship" or a faucet network which incentivizes clean up in a neighborhood, etc. Having physical faucets in the real world to reward good deeds or support those in need would be awesome. Bitcoin is for the people, by the people, let's all help each other, incentivize each other, and make this world a better place :-)
@_date: 2014-12-03 07:26:46
Charles Babbage could've been Satoshi:  All the telegraphers would be constantly trying to figure out who Satoshi was and the telegraphers were the first to get rich off of bitcoin's soaring value in the late 1800s. There'd be debate over how bitcoin isn't very fair because few have access to telegraph lines. Then startup companies would pop up to increase public access to the telegraph network...
@_date: 2014-12-07 08:50:23
It has a camera inside the faucet which looks down at the qr code on your phone's wallet, recognizes it, sends about $1 USD worth of bitcoin to your address, and then gives you confirmation by changing colors with the LED lights that shine down from it, simulating water basically. A miami-based bitcoin startup company,  , created it and had it on display at this art gallery so that folks could get some bitcoin and then use it to tip the paintings which has qr codes beside them.

Send me a friend request if any of my privacy settings are preventing you from seeing my posts. Also, if you do decide to pick me, I'd like to give you a shout out on facebook and let everyone know that the money came from you. You also just gave me a fantastic idea, I'd like to do this same strategy of giving money away on my facebook for any friend who for the first time sets up a web wallet and really embraces bitcoin. Coinbase has a referral program which pays $5 to you and $5 to your friend if they signup and buy $100 of bitcoin. I could take the risk and start giving away $5 of BTC to folks who signup and if they're drawn into BTC, they'll probably buy $100 worth, and then we can keep the chain going, major network effect.

@_date: 2015-01-09 17:44:52
I'm one of the co-organizers of the Miami Bitcoin Hackathon and I believe that many of you are misinformed, Josh Garza was never listed as a speaker at the Miami Bitcoin Hackathon. In fact, the hackathon has no speakers at all, you might be confusing the Miami Bitcoin Hackathon with the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami. Also, you're linking to our registration page and instead should be linking to our homepage:

I'll let you know when we have our website ready and/or when we're accepting donations.

@_date: 2015-01-07 01:16:28
ah yes, no worries, there's nothing but good actors at our hackathon event which is the weekend before the conference, thank you for the tip and for the ones you gave to all others. We love tipping as well and we do it on special days like when microsoft announced bitcoin acceptance and tipped many xbox gamers to bring new blood into bitcoin

If you'd like some one on one guidance directly from me over video, I'd be willing to do that in exchange for bitcoin. I think that codeschool.com is great but I don't believe they accept bitcoin. What exactly are you trying to learn or do you need some guidance in choosing which technologies to learn?
@_date: 2015-05-19 19:20:19
I'm surprised that I've never come across anyone mentioning photonic computing in connection with bitcoin mining so I figured I'd go ahead and propose it here to get the discussion going...

Nice! The first prize hackathon novelty paper wallet featured in the background :-P
@_date: 2015-08-13 20:30:04
Thanks, it definitely works and gives you the 10% off as gyft points. Just so no one freaks out, keep in mind that the gift card code won't be revealed until about 30 minutes later, Gyft apparently waits for a few confirmations on the blockchain. Also, if you try to pay with Coinbase and you have 2FA enabled on your coinbase (as anyone should), then it won't work, you need to pay via their bitpay integration instead. Hope that helps everyone :-)
@_date: 2015-08-04 17:20:59
Thank you, hadn't seen a tipping Tuesday thread on here in a while, glad to see someone doing this again for the community
@_date: 2015-08-28 19:23:14
Congrats guys, really appreciate your service
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:52:58
The remaining value stays on the gift card and you can continue to use it in the future with no expiration date. I regularly burn through multiple gift cards a day and even stack them at the same merchant. It's as good as fold although fold is slightly better in that it can kickback remaining BTC value and gives that nice 20% off but gyft wins in being available with over 200 retailers righ tnow

Let me guess, you're coming for Ultra? hehe
@_date: 2015-04-27 20:42:04
nope, doesn't refund leftover balance, you just buy a denomination of gift card (they usually range from $10 to $500) with bitcoin and immediately upon purchase of that gift card, you receive 3% "cash back" in the form of gyft points that you can then apply to a future gift card purchase. Using Gyft or Raise or eGifter or anyone of these other services are great ways to get a little bit of free money basically
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:21:37
doing great work as always, this post never fails to inspire me and bolster faith in the potential of our community :-)
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:07:15
The Target I frequent has a Starbucks cafe inside of it so when Fold supports Target, I can cause inception lol. I currently use the Gyft app to convert bitcoins into target gift cards with 3% in gyft points and that starbucks inside the target can accept either target gift cards or starbucks gift cards so I get to hit up both via Gyft :-)
@_date: 2015-04-21 17:44:07
Thank you as always for doing this
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:51:29
That's definitely not a comprehensive list, it doesn't even include some high profile ones like mybitcoin.com where almost 80,000 BTC were stolen
@_date: 2015-04-10 15:04:31
This is terrible. You have no idea how they generate the private key and it could very well be a weak method. Furthermore, you should never buy physical coins in which the third party has generated the private key because you can't trust that. The only good physical coins are ones which make use of BIP38 which involves a private key that is useless without the unrevealed password that is set by you.
@_date: 2015-04-25 02:33:36
@_date: 2015-04-10 15:30:16
nothing, it's behind a generation as it has no BIP38, it's ridiculous to trust people in another country no less with generating and not sharing the private key to your own bitcoins. Anyone who buys this product understands nothing about how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:53:28

a bunch of people who don't read I suppose
@_date: 2015-10-18 16:28:27
I did a post like this a year ago in case you want to see what folks said then: 
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:54:39
It's inferior in that it works over the old closed &amp; centralized financial networks whereas bitcoin works over the world's open &amp; decentralized value transfer protocol
@_date: 2015-03-24 13:27:39
yep, just like domain name squatting from decades ago
@_date: 2015-10-20 20:44:53
Didn't mean to be part of any sort of smear campaign and I'm not connected to any other posts that are against cryptsy or making false claims etc. I just came across info and wanted to share and let people make their own conclusions. I know that when Gox was going down, plenty of people would've appreciated any tiny shred of info that could give them insight as to what was going on at Gox so I was just putting out there the little that I know. I hope that everything is indeed fine at Cryptsy and that the service can continue to improve over time. As a coder myself, I know the significant challenges in creating and maintaining massive applications. I double checked the info from the source of where I'd heard it and you're correct though that it was only one dev, who interviewed elsewhere perhaps that VP of dev I'd assume. The recruiter had told me multiple devs but didn't mean multiple from Cryptsy alone apparently. On a side note, your tech stack isn't all that bad and it appears that security must be decent if you've never been hacked but where your developers obviously have weakness is in UI/UX design. You're running on top of bootstrap 3.0 as your CSS framework but it isn't being used to the best of its abilities codewise and I'd recommend you have your developers take a look at foundation 5 instead or the upcoming bootstrap 4.0 as it becomes production ready in the future.

Hi there :-)
@_date: 2015-03-23 20:48:32

I think he's trying to tell me that I should use my bitcoin to buy him stuff from here: 
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:38:15
ah yes, I had forgotten about that, thanks! :-)
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:22:21
Agreed, him and Andreas have provided some of the best intros/explanations that I've ever come across, level-headed and unbiased too, great stuff :-)
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:58:16
Thanks for finding that, I hadn't noticed but I think that illustrates why the support for it should be right next to all the other payment options. Folks will miss it if it's only buried in that one little mention at the bottom of the FAQ. Also, that seems to only be valid for payouts, what about bringing bitcoin in? It'd be cool it bitpay or some similar service were integrated all the way through.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:11:04
I talked up bitcoin and showed bitpay in particular to this bar right by my place:  They're already using square with an ipad and thus seemed receptive to the idea and I'm going to try to spread more awareness to other brick and mortar business owners in the Miami area. I believe this kind of ground roots effort is indeed needed to help increase the adoption/use of bitcoin at a faster rate. Great idea to incentivize this kind of work although I'm happy to do it for free as well :-)
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:30:51
Perhaps we need more organization and concerted effort though, like what if we had a website similar to coinmap.org but which instead of showing merchants that currently accept bitcoin, it allows users to target any non-bitcoin-accepting merchant and announce their pledge to make a case for bitcoin to that merchant. Then other users can see this and decide if they want to target that same merchant too. The merchant will begin to take it more seriously as he realizes that lots of folks are asking about bitcoin as a payment method. That was just a quick idea, any others?
@_date: 2013-12-30 07:56:41

I'm not the creator, this is actually my gittip:  But I do think bitcoin would be perfect for that site

haha, that's the idea, we're all onto something very serious here but at the same time we have to always remember to not take life too seriously...

Yes, they're actually very low maintenance pets, as easy to care for as a hamster. The only challenge is gaining their trust as they're genetically such wild creatures but if they grow up with you from a very young age then chances of domestication are much better.

Awesome, thanks so much Chad for the great reply and I'm glad that you noticed this post here.

Agreed :-P the average intelligence of people who understand and believe in bitcoin is higher than the average person and it's also a well-known fact that individuals of higher intelligence are more drawn to experimenting with altered states of consciousness.

I have a friend who has his own bail bonds company and I totally told him to do this weeks ago yet he's ignored my advice. He could've easily had a bunch of free publicity just off of being the first. At least I did manage to convince him to buy some bitcoin and learn more about it...

hehe, I actually want to do a huge printout of the QR code + bitcoin logo + short link to an informative bitcoin site and place it on the outward facing side of sunblockers so that lots of folks throughout downtown Miami will be able to see it. We have to keep spreading this to the general public, nearly everyone in Miami still doesn't have a clue what bitcoin is :-/
