You should hold at least 5% of your wealth in Bitcoin. Don't sell all of it. Wealth preservation strategy in case hyperbitcoinization takes place.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:59:26
How about we compromise? 2mb blocks. It shouldn't be your way or the highway. The Bitcoin community is falling apart and people are leaving for other blockchains because of how inconsiderate this community has become.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:23:42
Ok and there are no downsides of raising the blocksize to 8mb. It doesn't lead ANY centralization at all. It just forces people to run pruned nodes and that isn't a bad thing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:49:33
Still bullish on the mempool. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:07:18
I would rather have a more functional network than worry about a few people in 3rd world countries running nodes. At 4mb blocks, bandwidth requirements in developed countries shouldn’t be too much of a concern. I guess that is where we differ.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:48:58
It's not stealing the lightning code from Bitcoin core. It's free for everyone to use; they don't own it. It's open source and that is exactly what Bitcoin Cash should do and plans to do.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:41:38
That isn’t a fair comparison because a large subsect of BTC holders still want a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:40:13
Even if the lightning network is implemented today, we still need a block size increase. The lightning channels settle on chain and plus people are still going to carry out large transactions on chain. We don’t need everyone to be running archival nodes, pruned nodes will work just fine.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:18:42
It’s not a scam. It has became a large faction within the greater bitcoin community because core has alienated them by neglecting their concerns to raise the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:12:10
Cryptocurrencies are a movement though. It’s an economic revolution.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:12:06
Gemini and GDAX are definitely going to start charging withdraw fees. It must be getting for them.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:45:40
Nah digital gold isn’t a feature. If bcash succeeds then it could do both. You don’t need a separate coin for every use case
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:40:32
They are currently working on one and they have plenty of time because lightning isn’t going to be ready for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:48:23
Ok well I don’t care. I’m buying bcash to protest core until they increase the blocksize. I’m not coming back until they do.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:26:30
Yes they will be able to run pruned nodes. Even a 5 mb block size doesn’t require large bandwidth requirements.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:14:18
They can still use Bitcoin without a ton of nodes running in there country.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:02:26
Interesting point though is that it is easier for venders to add bcash to their payment systems than segwit because bcash's source code is really close to non-segwit bitcoin. So I think it is more likely for venders to add bcash than segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:48:28
I’m very conservative on tax policy, but that is just absurd.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:36:46
Nah. You don’t need the full history. Some on chain scalability is way more important.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:26:48
Tbh they are probably going to add Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:19:59
No we don't.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:15:26
He still owns enough BTC in which he could plummet the Bitcoin price down to summer levels if he wanted to. You inferred that Satoshi would dump BCH and I was instead posing the possibility of him dumping BTC instead in this type of scenario.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:18:18
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:08:45
And yes I don’t see any problems with segwit I just want a blocksize increase because I think it’s a ridiculous debate.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:38:06
I hate how it’s gotten this way. I wish we could have compromised and taken ideas form both sides, but I guess you’re right at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:59:01
I agree with you. That would have been a better way to go about it. I was really anti bcash until core decided that they weren’t going to support a block size increase to 2 mb. That’s just ridiculous. Absolutely absurd. I’ve had enough, I love their progress on lightning and I support that, but I think bcash is better overall because it can use lightning in the future as well. 8mb + lightning is the best move. Yes, bcash did it in a scammy way, but I don’t care anymore because I’m so tired of this stupid 1 mb block debate.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:00:16
I have heard the arguments and will watch later, but raising the blocksize to 4mb will not lead to centralization. It would force a minority of nodes to prune their blockchains and there is no harm in that.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:16:06
You are very close minded and uniformed. I’m glad that industry experts like Satoshi and Vitalik agree with me.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:03:33
Nobody argues against the fact that core is a talented development team. I think you are misinterpreting their argument.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:34:34
We could just increase the block size to effectively kill off BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:46:55
No, people like you are literally killing Bitcoin. If this community is so unwilling to compromise I hope Bitcoin dies a long hard death. Like seriously, you are so close-minded that you have act like a bratty child? You need to compromise.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:59:06
Dude Satoshi was a supporter of bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:04:00
That's why a compromise would be nice. 2mb blocksize?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:28:49
The lightning network hubs needs on chain transactions to open. 1mb is just a bad argument.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:49:44
And it’s continuing to fall apart if we don’t do something.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:09:21
I support Bitcoin because it already has the best coin distribution. Most altcoins are highly centralized in distribution. And bitcoin has a lot of infrastructure built on it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:53:38
Exactly. He doesn't disagree with you. 2nd and 3rd layer are great, but you need an increase in blocksize to along with it. Vitalik, Satoshi - the biggest names in crypto recognize the need for block size an increase. Lightning network can not exist in a decentralized way with 1mb blocks. The only way 1 mb blocks will work is if you open centralized visa type hubs using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:27:38
Ethereum isn’t a shitcoin. Blockchain has applications beyond money you know.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:17:30
Yes, that is where we differ. I think that everyday citizens in third world countries don’t need to be running nodes. As their countries develop, these citizens will then be able to able to help maintain the most powerful financial system in the world. I don’t want to degrade user experience for everyone because some undeveloped nations don’t provide good ISP services .
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:35:15
The Business Technology department at my university is apparently "looking into it".
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:51:06
I never said it’s going to fix scalability. It will improve the network long term.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:01:30
Bitcoin is now just a promise of the future. Its a broken community - most have already sold for bcash or alts. Fees and confirmation times have lead to people fleeing the network. Also, when a plurality of people that use Bitcoin want a blocksize increase and then minority of the community takes BTC hostage says no fuck you I'm always right then people sell. Bitcoin is all just speculation right now. ZERO use cases, all promises of the future with a fragmented community.
Edit: if core doesn't listen to community input that frankly I think Bitcoin could die a slow death
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:39:19
Says you. And don’t give me statistics saying that it is low compared to the rest of the worlds fiat because they are all fucked up. And that 2% goes to the banks/elite and not to the people that’s the problem. It’s theft.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:05:07
That’s unrealistic because large transactions will still be done on chain.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:29:52
Can we please compromise on 2mb blocks now? Crypto is plummeting right now because the Bitcoin community is acting like a bunch of idealistic, stubborn assholes. Let's compromise on slightly bigger blocks. Life is all about trade offs.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:50:43
Or we can have 8mb blocks and the lightning network on Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:33:35
Ok then it’s “super inflationary”.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:14:16
Well what ever the bitcoin equivalent of a parity node in ethereum is. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:06:35
I sold most of it for ethereum and not bcash because I think that is a safe bet and I’m a big Vitalik fan, but I will come back if two conditions are met a) a small blocksize increase at least to 2mb blocks and b) the lightning network is completed. 
Edit: I would buy back if a) is met but would only hodl if b) looks promising
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:03:32
Lightning + increase blocksize at a rate on par with technological advancements.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:44:07
He literally said that 1mb was temporary
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:59:46
Yea, but won’t fiat always be slow because it is centralized so they have to go through a clearing house to prevent a double spend?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:06:58
So why can’t we increase the blocksize  to 4mb next summer? It would kill off Bitcoin Cash, allow the lightning network to operate more efficiently, and would still allow some transactions to be done on chain.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:56:31
A lot of them do though
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:23:48
Still centralized and you could use that same system on top of bitcoin although it would be centralized to create a global currency that isn’t hyper inflationary like the USD.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:57:33
1) Is true that centralized lightning hubs will form 2) Will I just put all my Bitcoin on the lightning network so I don't need to pay an on chain fee every time I want to spend my BTC 3) what is the point of the mainchain if we have lightning (why can't everything be done on lightning/ why would someone want to do a transaction on chain)
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:09:13
For those that do not support a blocksize increase to say 2 or 4 mb, would you support a blocksize decrease to say 1/2 mb? Or do you believe that a 1mb blocksize is the perfect size?
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:59:20
It’s not your vision. You can’t just take bitcoin hostage. A ton of coin holders disagree with you. So you tell me to leave and then you get mad when coinbase or other institutions adopt BCH. Idk why we can’t just meet in the middle with a compromise.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:26:43
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:47:40
Can we please just increase the block size to like 2 or 4 mb so that we can eliminate BCash. That is called compromising, which in this case will lead to progress.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:28:37
A USD today will lose essentially all of its value before I die due to inflation. And that is a skewed definition of hyperinflation because of the terrible standards we are accustomed to today.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:44:58
Bitcoin isn’t the only digital money.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:04:06
I’m kind of in the middle in ideology. That’s my dilemma. I support the lightning network, but also support bigger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:03:33
I don’t think infinitely increasing the blocks size is a scaling solution. It will allow the lightning network to operate more efficiently as transactions are needed on chain to open channels. Also, I would like for some  transactions still to be done on chain as the the lightning network will naturally lead to lightning hubs, but that is still ok for small everyday transactions. Lightning = more efficient and slightly decentralized checking accounts without fractional reserve banking, which frankly is an amazing thing. Plus, increasing the blocksize to like 4mb would only force a small minority’s of nodes to start pruning there chains. No harm in pruning either; negligible downsides. They are both necessary solutions to the greater problem.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:35:30
So you are unwilling to compromise on blocksize? I don't want to be part of Bitcoin if my voice won't be heard even when I'm in the majority.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:28:03
I support the lightning network and I’m impartial on segwit, but I want bigger blocks. Should I support BCH or BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:49:40
BTC: Digital Hold
XRB: Digital Cash
ETH: dapps 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:11:15
Soft forks don’t count as a blocksize increase as they are voluntary. I think segwit should have been a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:40:19
BCH is only getting legitimized because the chain has neglected the communities wants and needs. Most people want a blocksize increase. The rational behind doesn't matter. Instead of 8 mb we could do 2 mb blocks or maybe 1.5 mb (if possible) blocks. Any amount would demonstrate that Bitcoin is willing to compromise and take a variety of viewpoints into account.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:05:01
We need to hardfork to a bigger blocksize. Almost everyone agrees with Segwit. That wasn't a compromise. A large sector of the community still wants a blocksize increase and core is alienating them by ignoring their opinions.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:20:44
Soft forks create governance issues. No soft forks.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:11:17
Bigger blocks + lightning
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:55:16
That was a long time ago and only happened because ethereum was in its infancy it wouldn’t happen again today.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:02:27
No it’s not. Not if you took a vote of all bitcoin holders. Nope.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:50:36
One theory is that it could potentially lead to a decrease in decentralization, which is a valid argument to be discussed. So we could compromise (make it only 2mb instead of 4 mb or whatever) on the blocksize increase to accommodate for those viewpoints.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:05
Because the Bitcoin community won't compromise on bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:02:57
Would it ever be possible to get transaction times under like 30 seconds? I can't see bitcoin ever becoming a fiat currency replacement with the current transaction times.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:12:54
Is anyone concerned that bitcoin is not liquid-able anymore since you can't send from wallet to exchange?
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:53:41
Well there are other crypto alternatives so that logic is flawed.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:09:50
That is accurate and those reasons are why people support decentralization. It’s benefits are that it’s trustless not that it does things more efficiently.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:09:56
No you should pay every penny the government tell you to pay. At least if you are in the US you can vote the officials out of office if you don’t like what laws they have passed. You don’t let to decide what law do and don’t apply to you.

Ok murder laws shouldn’t apply to me because I don’t like them.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:19:25
Why isn’t everyone using segwit are there downsides?
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:49:43
what you mean coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:45:26
Can someone explain to me why bitcoin is better than litecoin on a technical level. Like, which one has better technology or pro/cons of both.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:18:52
What are the downsides to Segwit why isn’t everyone using it?
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:39:23
Why can’t I deduct the losses I realized last year from the money in my bank account losing value because of inflation? I feel like it’s the same principle. One is greater in magnitude, but they are exactly the same; no difference.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:15:49
Not without a scaling solution in place they won’t.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:49:24
How is the double spend issue not a problem. Like what is someone tries to spend the same amount on the lightning network and the main chain at the same time?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:29:49
That is just wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:36:30
I know what you are saying, but 1 mb is too small for even lightning networks. They have to settle on the main chain as well you know. Should we discourage people from joining bitcoin until we eventually have a solution for the problem because it is essentially unusable in its current form. 2mb with some kind of segwit hard fork that some people have discussed would be idle and that would allow for immediate expansion of the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:39:12
ETH is for payment and gas though. Multi-purpose. I think bitcoin in its current form is only good as a digital gold.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:36:21
Why can’t I deduct the loss of value on my taxes of the money in my bank account due to inflation of the US dollar? Technically I am experiencing losses. I feel like if bitcoin goes up it shouldn’t be taxable for the same principle. Not everyone wants to speculate on bitcoin some people want to preserve their wealth in a  scarce asset and that shouldn’t be taxable in my opinion. Same with gold. I think that until the US government stops printing undisclosed, ridiculous amounts of money then I shouldn’t be taxed when I am just trying to preserve my wealth.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:59:44
Dude could can’t selectively determine what laws apply to you. We live in a society it’s not all about you.

Don't sell all your bitcoin. Use the salt lending platform to get a lower interest loan to pay off the debt and use bitcoin as collateral. Great option.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:19:28
Why not use 2mb then? Right now bitcoin is constrained and cannot support more user adoption. It is a good compromise for right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:13:21
I know what you are saying, but I think you should let the market decide instead of exchanges determining the future of crypto. This is artificially going to crush BCH. I think the mass market will decide on its own without big institutional manipulation, which one is the real bitcoin. Exchanges should stay out of crypto politics.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:01:18
It's ok. I put it in ethereum, which is about to go on an amazing bull run. I will put my gains back in bitcoin once it hits $450, which I think is going to happen rather quickly.

Centralization will always be more efficient.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:19:49
I agree, but why 1mb blocks? Why not 2mb blocks? 1mb seems like an arbitrary cap. According to many people the lightning network can't even function properly on such small blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:21:41
100% agree. I sold my bitcoin until this can be agreed upon. 2mb was a very good compromise.
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:55:16

What if I created gift cards that had scratch offs on the back that underneath contained the private key. Obviously the creator of the gift card would know the private keys so it couldn't be trusted. Do you know of a way in which this could be done in a trustless manner, where nobody would know the private key until the scratch off label is tampered with?
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:18:03
But like you said there is barrier too that because you would have to check to make sure that nobody removed the 1mBTC from the hardware wallet.

Is there any way to create physical bitcoins? Like somehow create like a dollar bill that would be worth 1 mBTC? I’m asking for cases when a cellular network isn’t available like if the world monetary network system were to adopt bitcoin would there be a solution for those circumstances.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:13:03
So currently the only way to do this would be in a centralized manner were a bank would print the 1 mBTC dollar and they would claim that it is backed by BTC and always will be worth 1 mBTC. Kind of how USD was when it was backed by gold?
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:17:19
Damn. BTC to the moon.
@_date: 2017-05-19 21:33:19
Segwit needs to be enabled before the end of the summer if BTC doesn't want to be replaced by ETH as the dominant crypto. If it is enabled soon BTC will take off.
