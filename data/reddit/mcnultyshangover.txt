A string of bad news could easily drop it to 4k.

It's not our job to take on every troll, the guy said it's already been argued to death. The new guy should do his own research.

Why are people who seem to be vehemently against Bitcoin in the Bitcoin subreddit ��
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:58:43
I wish people would stop with the 'bitcoin to drop/raise ?k by the end of the week's predictions. They're based on nothing and add nothing to the overall discussion.

Every accompanying thumbnail has the YouTuber making a happy, sad or shocked face and a click-bait title.

The juxtaposition of posts like that are always conviently ignored, even as it's the logical continuation of that thought.

Not to sound like a smartass (because you specifically said withdraw) but does the whole banning credit cards from buying crypto thing count?
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:45:00
Yeah I gotcha. Was just trying to sneak in a 'well technically'. I personally think buying crypto (taxes) with credit (interest) is double dumb and banks banning it is a good thing overall (except the part where they're telling you what you can and can't use your access to credit for. But I've been up too long to get into that).

I see what you're trying to say but your logic is flawed. 
There aren't people in r/soccer saying, 'I can't wait until this sport is banned'. There are aspects of the game people generally don't like (FIFA, diving, etc) but the demise of the entire game itself isn't being called for. If we were to adhere to the criteria of a subs value based on your argument, r/soccer wouldn't have worth because no one is wishing for the cessation of the sport.
