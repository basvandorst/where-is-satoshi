It has zero chance of ever being a currency in my opinion. Maybe as a store of value, but not a currency. It's a race to see which crypto will fill that need. I don't think there will be any one coin that ends up being king. I think there will be winners for each niche(market) that they end up taking over in the real world. The best hope bitcoin has is becoming an actual alternative to physical gold. If that happens it will take off in value again, but they have to cross a lot of obstacles to get there.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:28:00
I absolutely agree, but I do see it getting to a point where enough people have bought in that could care less about the actual tech side of things and will continue to look at it as a way to make a quick buck. Until the number of people who understand what we're talking about outnumber the number of people treating it as a store of value then things will stay relatively the same. By then the other cryptos will be gaining so much momentum it will be too late for the bitcoin group to cash out and see that their gains are put into the correct coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:42:30
Like I said, you are an ignominious prick. Enough with the lambo shit lmao. Even if I was a billionaire I wouldn't buy a gaudy piece of shit car that's going to break down after a year. I hope you buy 2 or 3 and waste any money you've lucked into. You sound like a teenager who used his daddy's money to buy a bitcoin or two and now think you're some kind of financial wizard lmfao. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:35:10
Lmao you're just ready to say I don't know anything regardless of what I say or don't say. I didn't say I don't compare it with anything I was saying that I had made no mention of any comparison of any kind.

But that's not its high at all. It reached 19k last Thursday. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:14:23
I'm going to go with what others have calculated it to be and that's around 2k to 2500. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:29:38
There's a difference between being mad and being annoyed at stupidity. I just looked at your posts and you are the epitome of everything wrong with BTC investors.
Her de dur, I'm getting a lambo. Her de dur, I'm never working again, working is for plebs. Holy shit man, could you even be any cringier? I feel sorry for all of the ppl who are going to get shit on when the bubble pops, but you are definitely not one I will feel sorry for.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:14:46
By making bitcoin go down, they cause all the others to go with it. How do you not know that? BTC and the alts are inextricably linked. At least until all the exchanges switch over to allowing other alts to be the base pair for trading.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:21:17
I'm a little salty i didn't buy in at around 100 a BTC, sure. But I'm much more annoyed with all the latecomers who bought in at 10k and are delusional enough to think they'll end up making the same margins that the 100 dollar bitcoin players are seeing. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:07:22
Bit premature to be celebrating, no?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:26:19
Lmfao what money have I lost? You're fucking retarded if you honestly believe what you just wrote. I bought ethereum for the long haul. It's up 75 bucks a coin from what I paid, so how that's a loss is beyond me. This post is the perfect example of why most bitcoin investors are a joke. Lmao I'm saving this shit for posterity. Too damn funny.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:20:57
But that's assuming it will continue to do so forever. At some point it will reach critical mass and the value will be so high it won't even be worth buying into unless you're a whale.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:05:59
It's all good my man, I'm sure it'll be over 20k in no time. I don't know if I would continue to put all my bets on BTC though. One of the alts will dethrone it before long. It's shortcomings are being brought to light more and more, so I don't know how many more pumps were gonna see.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:13:35
You said it yourself though, if a better alternative shows up then it will take bitcoins place. You're basically gambling that that won't happen by holding onto your BTC indefinitely. The tech behind ethereum is vastly superior and if and when it gains popularity it will take bitcoins place. That's my take on it anyway. I don't think bitcoin will ever be reduced to nothing, but I do think one of the cryptos will take it's place and my bet is on ether.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:18:35
It's utility would be the coin being used as a store of value. The only thing that makes anything valuable is how valuable people perceive the object to be. As long as enough people perceive the value of bitcoin to be what it is and feel confident that it won't plummet without notice than it could be used as such. That's basically what it evolved into even though it was originally meant to be used as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:24:48
Bitcoin has an intrinsic value then it has a market value. The price speculation has created a bubble and therefore artificially inflated it's worth. I'm not arbitrarily defining these things, that's just how all markets work. It's a super basic principle. The only people ignoring it are those that stand to gain from the speculative gains.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:31:08
Except I didn't compare it to anything. The user above me did.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:01:45
Wait, wait, wait. You go on a rant about how it's basically impossible to know what's going to happen because these are unprecedented times, but then go on to act like you know what IS going to happen. Lol you don't see the irony in that?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:51:00
Tell that to all the economists that study markets for a living. There's a reason companies like Forbes and Bloomberg don't invest in bitcoin and why steam and several others have stopped accepting it as payment. I have no skin in the game, so I don't have a bias either way lol.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:12:55
Alot of them will, yes. A lot of them will crash and burn if it doesn't work either.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:08:36
But how in the world is something so volatile considered better than subjecting an asset to inflation? Genuinely curious 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:53:21
Tell me how I'm wrong. Oh wait, I'm not. It uses inferior tech and has only gotten this far based off name recognition alone. What do you think happens when it's new investors actually start learning about what they invested in? It will never be digital cash and it won't work as a store of value either. The first crypto that cracks scalability will overtake it and everyone who held their BTC through this frenzy will be kicking themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:06:41
I agree with just about everything you just said, including the dial up analogy. That's actually how I explain it to all my layman friends lol. I think eventually there will be 10 or so cryptos that become massively successful at various functions, but in the meantime it will be market war to see who wins it in which field.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:12:35
Lmfao such an elegant argument you've made. I'd be telling me to shut the fuck up too if I had been dumb enough to put my life's savings in BTC. Ignorance is bliss, until you're broke.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:32:41
Go tell that to the hundreds of millions of people who use federal reserve notes to pay for literally everything lmao. Dumbest shit I've read all day lol.
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:56:44
How is racism getting dragged into this? Quit your bullshit and stop being shady, has absolutely nothing to do with skin color ffs.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:04:17
You're responding right back and slowly sounding more and more incoherent. Now you even sound about as articulated as Trump Lmao!! Sad!
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:26:12
I'm ETH, XVG, XRP, LTC and REQ. Half ETH and the rest are split pretty evenly.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:47:39
Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up then. I'm doing amazing financially speaking and am just using crypto as part of my investment portfolio, so even if I lose everything it won't do shit to me. You on the other hand are just another loser who bought into the get rich quick movement. Have fun being a piece of shit on the internet, that really seems like a fulfilling way to spend your time! Good day :)

Because I don't have the proper credit to open a margin trading account. I want to short, badly. If you know anywhere that will accept people with credit scores lower than 650 then please let me know!
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:42:15
If you only buy and sell on coinbase than what difference does it make? You're assuming everyone is exchanging from coinbase to a different platform, but that would be retarded.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:06:34
The market was overdue for a big correction. It went up like several hundred billion in 45 days. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:38:25
This sub is so cringey. You guys realize your precious bitcoins are massively over valued, right? I just don't understand how anyone can't see that.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:52:09
Fiat is completely different. There's no military or regulations commities to enforce the value of bitcoin. You're comparing Apple's with oranges.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:38:00
Soooo ETH is up 300 dollars in 48 hours. Still think it's a shit coin? Lmao
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:32:44
Or I'm just posting in this sub and keep seeing a particular user make an ass of himself again and again. Lmao
Not to mention I can guarantee you I've made more money off my litecoin this week than you have with your precious BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:14:28
Lmfao I didn't even imply any of those things. I'm just saying you can't call someone out for doing something and then do that exact thing you called them out for. I don't even understand how you justify that lol.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:58:03
Go buy some more bitcoin bro.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:50:09
I don't think bitcoin will be going away anytime soon and even if it does tank I'm sure it will bounce back to a more stable position. I'm just annoyed with all the newcomers who think they've hit the jackpot and are never going to have to work again. The way I see it, buying ethereum right now is like buying into BTC when it was 400 a coin. I don't care how long I have to sit on my investment since I only put in what I can afford to lose. /rant
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:24:17
It's only predictable until it isn't anymore. There's no frame of reference to go off of here, so all projections are valid the way i see it. Even if bitcoin does tank I'm sure it will bounce right back. I just don't see how anyone could actually know what's going to happene here. We're in unexplored territory.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:37:04
You're putting words in my mouth. I said I was upset I didn't buy into BTC years ago. That has nothing to do with the actions of anyone but me. However, I do think it's harmful for users like you to make it appear as though BTC will always be growing like it has because some poor souls are going to believe your bullshit and lose a lot of money. I don't want to see that happen to anyone. I wouldn't expect someone as ignominious as you are to understand the difference between the two 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:08:21
 Until it gets below where it was before this big pump, I don't think this can be considered a crash, more like a much needed correction. It's still up several thousand dollars from its previous ATH, for now anyway lol.
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:58:02
Okay I hate being this guy but the genetic inclination to steal comment is racist af.
I feel like a sjw for even saying that but don't be a cunt.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:19:36
Lmfao oh yes, I'm so poor. The median intelligence of this sub proves my suspicions correct. 90 percent of you are get rich quick people who invested in this without understanding any of the underlying tech. Do you not see how ridiculously bogged down the network is? It has to use enormous amounts of electricity just to move small amounts of BTC. If you think that's sustainable then I genuinely feel sorry for your naivety.
@_date: 2018-09-27 02:29:17
Shitty analogy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:22:43
Bitcoin being the base trading pair at the vast majority of exchanges is the biggest factor linking  bitcoins prices to the alts.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:06:46
I guess because of the fact that they've been like that for quote awhile and it's continued to see growth. So the problem is more likely to be a combination of factors, and yes that is more than likely one of them, but not the only one.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:55:15
Interesting. You are literally the only person I've ever seen say this. I have however read article after article about how inefficient and slow the transactions are. When BTC hit the futures market it still had like 210k transactions that were waiting to be processed. Ethereum handles more transactions per day than BTC and all the other cryptos combined. That's pretty telling.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:41:51
Ethereum is a shit coin, huh? Now I've heard it all lmao. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:05:32
How about the market going up almost 300 billion in 6 weeks. That doesn't happen without a big correction coming right after. I was under the assumption everyone knew this was coming. It was just a matter of when.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:31:42
They say the actual value is around 1500, but I've seen other calculations that put it slightly higher. You have to go down to number 4 I think to see them talk about it's intrinsic value.
And thank you for not shitting on me for going against the popular opinions. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:19:13
You seem to be getting the same advice from everyone. Stop spreading your own miserable existence onto others. No one cares that you don't like your life, do something about it or shut up. Sitting on a fraction of a bitcoin is not doing something worthwhile with your life.  So pathetic.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:36:18
I have a couple grand in litecoin and ethereum because those are two best viable options in my opinion. I'm in it for the long haul. Once one of these cryptos are actually able to be a substitute for fiat we will see that coins value skyrocket past anything bitcoin could possibly hope for. Even if it just takes over a small percentage of the fiat market it will still have a market cap in the trillions. That's what really gets my jollies going.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:18:15
Huh? Tons of different alts have collective developments going on. There's new partnerships being formed everyday outside of BTC, and improvements on the blockchain concept that leave BTC in the dust. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:28:04
Haven't they been working on lightning  for years though?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:27:29
It makes more sense that a couple whales decided it was time to cleanse the market and sparked FUD by selling a shit load at once, so they can buy a bunch back at cheaper prices for the next run. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:27:23
And what?
