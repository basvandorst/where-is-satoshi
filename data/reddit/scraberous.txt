Credit card has good protection, Paypal does protect if you’re not dumb enough to use ‘friends and family’ to pay people you don’t know.

I’ve hodl’d for years, the reason I don’t buy with BTC is that there’s no buyer protection. If I make an online purchase and the seller doesn’t ship the goods, there’s no way to trace or recover the payment.
I appreciate same can be said of bank-transfer, but until the crypto system can improve upon the safety of existing transaction methods, it’s not going to be widely adopted by the pragmatic masses.
BTC with integral escrow is what I’m waiting for.

isn’t its biggest problem that if you pay for something and the goods don’t turn up, you can’t trace the crook who took your coin?

Thanks for the positive answer. It looks like there’s a space in the crypto ecosystem for an automated multi-sig, or human admin partial-key ‘safe payments’ service.
I wouldn’t mind paying a small fee when using btc for online shopping, if the ‘trust’ factor was managed by a reviewable and accountable 3rd party.
This may not suit everyone, but from my experience, it’s this factor which keeps my network of crypto hodling buddies from using btc as a preferred transaction currency.

bcus China is already doing a shitload mre than the US and Europe to mitigate their impact on global warming. Maybe you should get off your porch and find out a bit more of what other nations are doing.
Their human rights record may not be acceptable but they are pioneering sustainable energy and reducing waste.

have my upvote for highlighting the emperor’s sartorial faux-pas.

My friends run a BMX bike company selling the new 22” wheel size, their cart/ checkout has simple instructions for BTC payments but no customers have chosen it over PayPal option.
Feedback is “no buyer protection“
“ too complicated “
“takes too much time”
Bitcoin won’t get mainstream adoption until those problems are fixed.

Could escrow ever work for BTC blockchain transactions? The sole reason I use fiat-cards or PayPal in preference to crypto is that I feel as vulnerable using BTC, as if using a direct bank transfer to an anonymous trader, or buying online using Western Union. Will the blockchain ever give us any protection against scammers?
