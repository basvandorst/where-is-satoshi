Fuck you coin base. 
Last week I bought $100 worth of Bitcoin, which was trading approx  or so. It took a solid week to process and see the funds in the account, by then it appreciated to almost $400. 
So why do I only have $100 worth of btc in there? It should have been the prorated/appreciated amount. 
 Oh, not to mention the time my account was amongst the many to get hacked and everything was stolen. 
To hell with you, coin base... To hell.

How do I figure it out? What do I need to do? Hint please?

I know. It says I won some bitcoin but never received the winnings. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:05:09
I gave you guys .001 btc and never even saw my ticket on the board. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 02:49:48
What's this? ?
@_date: 2014-09-14 06:37:57
Umm, I just played and kinda feel like this is BS. 
Sent btc and nothing happened....

You're a scammer and I can prove that you don't pay out
@_date: 2014-09-14 21:50:45
So how do we receive the money we won? Does it go into our account automatically?  If so, how long does it take? 
@_date: 2014-09-27 21:02:46
I know! The countdown ended today. It said I won some bitcoin but it hasn't paid out. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 19:31:26
Bull shit.

Effortlessly?  
How much effort does it take to click a mouse? 
@_date: 2015-09-09 05:44:59
You probably shouldn't have spent your money on bitcoin in the first place then. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:09:57
Woohooo! I'd like some bits please ;)
@_date: 2015-04-01 06:36:16

@_date: 2015-04-02 00:39:01

@_date: 2015-04-14 19:49:12
Bit me! 
@_date: 2015-03-31 17:52:54
