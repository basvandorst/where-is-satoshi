That writer hasn't got a clue.

I expected this to be a good joke about beating your wife. IE, have you stopped beating your wife yet?

Maybe this is a stupid thought, but wouldnt something like Torrent's DHT system be a feasible method?

If You own the server, then its as secure as you make it.

if you are very poor... its worth it to pool, even if its only a little bit of time.. though running at 75C might be a problem... you should double check and make sure your GPU fan is running at full speed... i had a heat problem and it turned out my GPU fan was locked at 35%. ( I used MSI Afterburner to scale the fan speed to the GPU's temperature)
Also, you might try some of the other pools.. BTCMine, Slushs, bitcoinpool, there are alot of them, i started with bitcoinpool but its payout wasnt good for me, so now i'm at BTCMine and ive made more than you... at about half the Mhash's (25Mhash/s for my GPU.. damn nvidia.)

Also if you use secondlife there is  which you can convert L$ to BTC.. they charge 0.02 BTC to transfer funds to your own wallet.. but if you already have the L$ its one of the better ways.. (mind you, the conversion rate is fairly high at the moment... but it may climb alot higher before this week is through)

there are many other solutions if things change for the worse... They might ugprade the system every few years to keep up with a changing world... they can also replace the entire system if they feel like it.. painlessly.. just define a conversion rate, and allow the old chain to buy in to the new chain... so that 0.00001 BTC that you own, which is your life savings... is suddenly worth 1000 of the new currency :p
another solution might be allowing the coins to regenerate in some method.
its not an immutable system, but the rules defined now are quite handy... 'running out of bitcoins' is not going to be a problem for over a hundred years.

it could be... but ive figured out a few painless ways.. and if i can figure it out, so can the devs in 100 years :p

do some research on bitcoin mining and pools... there is a chance (if you turn generating on) but its very very slim... the built in mining program only uses the CPU, and is VERY inefficient. 
to give you an estimate of how powerful it is.. My Phenom II X4 955, running all 4 cores, produces a max of 4500Khash per second.. this means my chances of finding a block reach about 95% in 2 years (if the difficulty didnt go up... which it will) my GPU on the other hand, using a specialized mining tool can mine at 25,000 Khash per second... but its not very good at it. The best miners can mine at around 700,000 Khash per second on the GPU.
Also, the more hashes put toward mining, the higher the difficulty. The system scales so that a block is discovered cracked every 10 minutes, no faster, no slower. 
Pools are a better bet, hundreds of people pooling their CPU and GPU clocks together to produce gigahashes per second... the one i'm using is around 140 Gigahash/s and when we crack a block it is divided amongst the participants (weighted to how many hashes per second you produce... and since i'm so low, i get a very low percent.) but ive still made maybe half a bitcoin in the past 4 days. :D

Very likely it will be treated as a foreign currency, and you will pay taxes on the conversion.

the wallet only holds the address.. the cloud holds references to transactions which end at that address..

i had the problem of efficiency... for some reason my miners have terrible efficiency on bitcoinpool while on other pools they seem to do fine... also. 
I've made alot more money in BTCMine.. though i've been thinking of trying MtRed
@_date: 2011-05-17 07:00:17
can you define what makes it 'not a real currency'?
the USD is a 'real currency' but its little more than play money, little green pieces of paper. It only has value as long as the one who holds it and the one who recieves it believe it conveys a value. 
And there are A LOT of people who believe in the value of bitcoin.

Aye, id only suggest virwox if you already have linden... I recieve an income through SL, i make alot of money there.. so Virwox is great for me. The fee for converting L$ to BTC is quite small for me, and the 0.02BTC fee for transfers out is small enough.
@_date: 2011-05-17 17:55:16
MtGox I believe.

ive made about 2BTC in a pool over the last few days. Its possible to make money.
A pool groups together all the processing power to create a greater chance.
The more processing power you throw in to the pool, generally, the higher your % of the block you get. I've only got some 34Mhash/s so i get very very little :p less than 0.02 BTC per block usually.
@_date: 2011-05-17 17:39:16
yes, very sad... now come here big boy. :P 200BTC an for an hour... 
@_date: 2011-05-17 05:54:23
I also like my roads, my safety net incase my family dies and i'm paralyzed from the neck down... 
how about start paying taxes and try to convince some sane people to run for office?
@_date: 2011-05-17 13:06:25
hah, point.
@_date: 2011-05-17 05:43:58
This is a false statement. BTC transfers are NOT truly anonymous, and are actually fairly hard to make anonymous. 
It is true there is no name or bank account attached to a transaction, but this does not make it anonymous. Very likely who you are transacting with knows who you are (or you wouldnt be buying/selling something to/from them?) and the transaction is publicly available to ANYONE to view.

if there are 20 lemons.. and there are 5 people who hold all 20 lemons... thats 4 lemons per person.. 
add 15 people... thats 1 lemon per person... everyone could have an even share, but some people horde their lemons, others sell them off at a higher price because they are worth more.
now add up to 65 total people.. and they all want lemons, suddenly the value of those lemons skyrockets... to 20/65 or roughly 0.3 lemons per person... that makes them 3 times the worth... atleast on the face of it. But some people horde, some people sell at a gain.. then add a few more lemons to the mix, one or two, just a trickle... and imagine that you can sell a tenth of a lemon.. or a hundredth. just a single little bit of pulp. Well now, you have a very interesting mix of people hording, people buying, people selling... which changes every few minutes. And suddenly the worth of a lemon changes by the minute. some people who buy, watch the price drop and start hording, some people who buy watch the price go up and sell off to make money... which changes the value again.
