Except it's more technical than mempool is just usage.
For instance let's say coinbase starts using batching, they can essentially send payments thousands of users using just one transaction.
Kind of goes back to the work smart not hard....

There is a limit though. I believe IRS allows you to claim up to $2,000/yr in lost collateral (applies to stocks &amp; crypto)
so at most you'd get a couple hundred dollars back for it on taxes.

These kind of posts are so annoying.
If your money is on an exchange, that's your fault.

Learn your lesson and stop bitching

And the response to that is to send billions of phishing emails in an attempt to defraud people that have nothing to do with big oil companies?

Everyone has a different price entry point, so if your cost avg is $1000 vs $4000, your mentality is different.
You also have people who take profits along the way

Why would you spend something that increases in value?
