The address prefix is bc1 for bech. 3 for regular segwit
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:43:50
But every wallet can receive from a bc1 address and I can take advantage of the cheaper transaction fees regardless of who I send it to?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:05:34
Do you know a rough estimate of a bc1 to bc1 transaction price?
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:26:08
So I should get a bc1 address instead of 3 address or is it not that simple?

Buy and forget. A dip is nothing in the long run

Decent internet and 120gb plus internet. Uncapped internet bandwidth as well. You can adjust how much ram you use and how much of a node you want

You're going to be a rich 20 year old though
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:37:05
I want it
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:15:10
...but there's nothing wrong buying something full price if its worth it

Sell your wife to buy more bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:20:08
You dont get paid. I saw a very rough cost calculation of $40 a year for a full node 24/7 but you'll have to calculate for your own circumstances

It's an altruistic endeavour but if you believe in bitcoin beyond just making a buck then it's worth the electricity fees to help it become more decentralised
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:09:06
How do you get these stats?

You engineered the liquid yourself? I work with dielectric fluid cooling with emphasis on enhancing the boiling on the CPU
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:53:39
Yeah I really don't get the point of OP's post
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:50:48
This is quite gay
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:17:03
In fairness now you probably would've cashed out way before but still...

Guess im too late then

It will go down to below 70 over the weekend and bank holiday(s). Shoot up dramatically around Tuesday and coming days ($85). Then make it $100 in a week or 2
@_date: 2013-03-29 13:06:38
thanks :)
@_date: 2013-03-31 02:47:58
Wouldn't be too sure about security. At least one person has had access to your FB account. Someone could easily tip themselves all your bitcoins
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:24:51
Sounds good. ETA on the project?
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:35:39
I would tip you for that but it seems you're doing well for yourself. I'll think you'll live
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:49:04
So i'm guessing that 10,000 btc pizza is now worth a million dollars
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:43:26
Would love a link if you can find it
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:26:01
Will it accept skrill?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:08:32
If not he's probably bitcoinmillionaire now
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:52:08
hey down the line that person you tipped could in turn tip a bitcent worth $100
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:21:38
I couldn't even begin to think of a story that involves bitcoin curing cancer
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:04:21
Whered you get the $250?
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:22:53
Have you posted this to r/ouya?
@_date: 2013-03-31 20:03:09
Supposedly Kim Dotcom wants to make one
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:29:48
How did you get $9000?
