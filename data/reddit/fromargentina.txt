oh the wiki, thanks!

It did, and thanks for pointing me this out! I'm really sorry.
At first I priced the products fixed on BTC, but it was too much risk, so now I fixed them at USD. By default, the option is BTC, so it was my mistake I didn't remember to change the currency.
Thanks a lot, and sorry again!

Fixed that! Only "Small" size is out of stock, Medium and Large are available!

Thanks for your words.
The price is fixed on BTC, so take advantage when BTC/USD is low :)
Maybe I'll change the price to USD dollars and convert it for each sale. Although I really like to fix a price in BTC since I believe in some way it helps to give more "value" to Bitcoin as a currency.

Sorry, you are right.
Actually, it is not my product. I'm just contacting local sellers from Argentina and introducing them to Bitcoin.
This is just an experiment to show them the value of Bitcoin as currency. Nowadays they limit their audience to Argentina because it's difficult to cash out from PayPal.
If they start to see that they can get customers using Bitcoin, they may up their own stores that accept Bitcoin.

I decided to start this blog to sell Argentinian products. I will add one every two weeks.
All products will be from a new wave of Argentinian local sellers that use the power of the internet to open up shop. The thing is that they limit their products to an Argentinian audience.
This is an experiment to show the value of a global currency.
Feedback appreciated :)

I have followed your advice. Now the price is fixed on USD. Thanks!
