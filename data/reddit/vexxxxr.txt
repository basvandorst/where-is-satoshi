I'd also like to point out that there was no entry barrier to using the internet as long as you had a connection and a small amount of people were willing to spend their time creating things for you to do on there. With bitcoin, it needs to be accepted more widely before it can be used daily. It's a form of currency, it requires everyone to believe in its value before it can be useful in that sense.

I understand that it's a network designed with incentives for securing it (mining) but I recall seeing on countless occasions that by running a full node you're helping the decentralisation of the network by offering more points of contact for other nodes to verify the chain. Is this not the case?
Out of curiosity, what benefits do you gain by using a hardware wallet in conjunction with a full node? Thanks for the help btw.

Ah ok, I will definitely look into forwarding my ports then as the only reason I'm running the node is to support the network.

Yes it's up to date.

Ok will try this and see if it helps.

So as long as my client is staying up to date with the blocks I'm connected to the network and forwarding my port isn't actually essential?

Shoulda dropped it for BITCONNECT! I hear those lads are drowning in it.

I agree. I think we could see it test the 3000-3200 range in the next few months and that will be as low as it goes. The rally will be slow starting but pick up Steam in 2020.
