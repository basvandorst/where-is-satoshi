that's a fair point. Though the signals might not be detectable from afar if they're using bluetooth or smartphone radios. There was a protest in Hong Kong coordinated by firechat(bluetooth) mesh, no internet required.

"Into or out of the country". Last time I checked the majority of North Koreans are in North Korea, lol.

Send BTC through SMS, it works.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:26:09
bribe the border guards and goons.
@_date: 2016-08-14 10:34:12
Yes, you should use it to educate yourself sometime. 
You do not need "Internet Access" to send SMS.
You do not need "Internet Access" to form a meshnet.
Yes OpenDimes would work too, there already exists a black market in North Korea for USB drives.
@_date: 2016-08-12 21:52:18
SMS works (thumbs up)
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:44:42
From what I've read, a lot of North Koreans do have electricity and there's a black market for usb drives with american movies / television. In the future they could setup a DIY meshnet and they could incentivize nodes with BTC micropayments.
@_date: 2016-08-11 22:16:57
I'd like to get bitcoin to the North Korean people, could potentially help them get out
@_date: 2016-08-14 22:19:42
you've really taken the fun out of "magic" internet money. Where there's a will there's a way brother.

one of very few r/bitcoin posts I've downvoted. I don't agree with Tim all the time but I learned a lot from his book Great Chain of Numbers. He's a diligent researcher and has always been riding the frontier of this technology but with a grain of salt. Something that is rare in the bitcoin world. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:43:04
The Tradenet is forming.
@_date: 2014-11-21 10:05:45
Apologies for posting that, I wasn't thinking from your perspective, just trying to help some bitcoiners where bitcoin is needed most. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 06:42:43
also nodes are paid to leave their computers on
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:59:19
Thanks, so let me just clarify. An HD account can have multiple private keys and you can also have multiple HD accounts?  And all of it is backed up by that 12 word phrase?
@_date: 2014-08-16 06:11:00
they make 3 copies of each file, that's standard redundancy
@_date: 2014-01-24 09:41:23
To me this seems to complicate BTC transactions with antiquated technology.  I'm all for introducing old ideas so the public can understand new ones but it just seems like a step backwards when I could simply scan a receiving code and press send.  Maybe useful for people who don't have smartphones I suppose.

Are you thinking of an elevator from earth literally to the moon?  ELSIE is going to be an elevator from the moon to space to put it simply. Though they do plan on building an earth elevator from the earth to space as well when the technology is ready.  
@_date: 2014-08-16 07:49:36
I could be wrong, but I think that's where the blockchain comes in
@_date: 2014-10-22 02:50:59
What about Delegated Proof of Stake?  I'm pretty sure Daniel Larimer developed DPOS after this paper was published, there's seems to be a lot of confidence surrounding it
@_date: 2014-09-27 07:43:42
your mind terrifies and amazes me. =D
@_date: 2014-08-16 07:48:15
good point, but nodes are also paid for selling bandwidth (ideally) and the protocol will pick the most reliable nodes first automatically.
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:37:29
good point
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:35:45
There's a BTC link at the bottom of their indiegogo page
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:57:28
You seem to be implying that P2P technology can and will be adversely regulated by government if they caught wind of this.  But the truth is the technology can't really be stopped (to the best of our knowledge)   
These types of scenarios are actually advantageous for individuals living in the squalor of third world warlords, corrupt administration, etc.  Also you have to consider this is merely entertainment based on a well established and real idea since the early 90's.  I would argue we need as much diversity in the bitcoin ecosystem as possible and in terms of entertainment there's little to none.  
You should be more concerned by Cody Wilson and Amir Taaki's efforts.

Also, funding Research and Development would be tremendos

Question.  Is the word backup good for ALL HD accounts made?  I made a second and there's no option to back it up

In 2014 me and a friend stormed John Gilmore's trailer to preach to him about Bitcoin and Blockchain Tech after a Q&amp;A he did on technology and psychedelic therapy in a tent surrounded by pillows, cushions, and tea
He's a fellow who co-founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He also co-authored the bootstrap protocol in the 1985. 
He seemed interested but also very skeptical, funnily enough!
Anyways, I completely agree, The Internet &amp; Bitcoin decentralize money/power. Psychedelics decentralize the soul. Support the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:26:43
Decentralized systems in general if lived up to full potential are much cheaper and much faster than centralized, for example delegated proof of stake blockchain requires no miners and is quick as ripple.
@_date: 2015-01-22 20:40:32
Friendly discussion / dialogue + might be trying to setup a multisig live. We'll see how the night pans out we usually keep things quite casual and human.
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:17:54
gonna be fun
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:01:47
Awesome! Let me know if you need my tipping address ;)
@_date: 2017-01-13 03:39:32
Bitcoiners like me are used to reading live BTC to USD conversions from using wallet interfaces. This is why I almost brushed it off, I thought it was dust.
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:02:01
I didn't say it was intentionally misleading, I did misread it but others will too.
@_date: 2012-08-02 07:30:54
i love how you can take the engine out with ease, there's a Jacque Fresco interview from 1974 with Larry King where he says all cars should have this function in the first place.

I've never heard of anyone getting jerked around by cavirtex I think the guy really believes in bitcoin, he phoned me and seemed nice and helpful.   If you have any doubts about the exchange simply don't leave bitcoin or CAD in there for a long time, trade and transfer to your wallet as quick as you can.  Exchange rate does suck but it's not THAT bad I think of my bitcoin as a long term investment so it doesn't really bother me.

We did an interview with Patrick Howell O'Neill crime reporter who was at everyday of the silk road trial. In the interview he continuously notes that there was some fuckery going about.
@_date: 2015-03-08 06:12:20
we interviewed Patrick Howell crime investigator who was at every day of the trial, he basically told us the whole trial didn't make much sense at all and there was definitely a lot of fuckery about

are you guys planning a web app? I would love funds forwarding + locks + multisig for our bitcoin hangout.
@_date: 2016-05-08 11:22:54
It's easy to throw the genius word around, but I have the same sentiment as you. It's like a high schooler who shows up at the exam knowing all the answers but cheats anyways. It doesn't add up.
@_date: 2015-02-04 07:16:55
totally agree. Funny enough I actually met an Esperanto guy for the first time today!
@_date: 2015-02-03 07:32:51
That's not much of a prediction, it already exists!

Thank you bitfantasy!
@_date: 2013-10-31 05:38:14
I forgot to say this error occurs when loading the blockchain so the blockchain can never fully load because of the memory allocation error
@_date: 2013-09-07 21:47:27
That's awesome thank you very much
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:25:59
Thank you! just updated but I'm still getting an error when importing to blockchain.  Hopefully it wont reindex after a crash now though.
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:28:54
It totally worked, thanks again!
@_date: 2013-09-07 19:01:22
I agree, eventually I would like to release open source plans and give them to people at shows
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:42:09
I'm not saying trust a human.  I'm wondering why didn't bitcoin plan to include wallets in le cloud encrypted so that only an algorithm controls it, no human can fuck with it and all transactions are shown.  If no hiccups appeared then it would be trusted
@_date: 2013-09-07 19:00:02
Yes do you live around the area?
@_date: 2013-09-07 21:40:24
Thank you so much man,  I'm new to this bitcoin tip system I think it worked though?  Anyways kindred spirits we are keep in touch
@_date: 2013-10-31 06:10:31
Of course an update! reindexing blockchain on 0.8.5 I'll let you know if it works! thanks
@_date: 2013-09-07 21:46:34
yes, I start my pitch at 4:52.  I've been supporting bitcoin since they were $10 a pop.  Big fan
