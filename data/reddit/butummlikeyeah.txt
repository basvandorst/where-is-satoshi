It's not an all the time thing, just a potential problem, and the more of an information asymmetry exists, the greater the potential problem. Insurance companies have developed many clever models of determining risk (it's their business, after all), but this in particular is one where the risk is probably of such a hidden nature there is no real way to tell.

Except really, the second one isn't right, either. At any time, the only people that can steal your physical wallet with dollars from you would be those within close proximity. At any time, if you have a device connected to the internet that holds a wallet with something like BTC, theoretically, just about anyone in the world with an internet connect could be a potential thief. And if someone tries to steal my physical wallet, I can run and catch them, or put up physical resistance.
Unsecured digital wallets are more like taking your physical wallet and placing it in the middle of times square on new years eve and checking on it occasionally to see if it's still there.
There is a large difference there.

I'm not even gonna lie, this is the most idiotic bullshit I have ever read in this sub. Do you know how much roads cost to maintain? To build? The engineers that expect paid to design it? The economists who study traffic patterns to make them efficient?

Since money is "worth more" while deflation is occurring, it's easier to pay interest on it.
But I don't agree that anyone would loan any reasonable amount of money during a deflationary point in time. Not enough to effect the economy in a useful way, at least. Severe repercussions on those attempting to create businesses, not just from loans, but from other factors as well.

Generally the best way to anticipate behaviors of things like this, concerning large entities like ghash, is through organizational behavioral analysis, i.e., game theory. Generally the best way until now to anticipate behavior of individuals with minimal market power has been microeconomics, but that is gladly losing ground to behavioral economics (because it doesn't assume the rational actor is a person, and starts to account for the variance in individual irrational behavior).
So I would say, I'll have to take this all as a case study in behavioral analysis.

Definitely is better to show things like this as 2D. I would recommend looking at xkcd's occasional 2D charts ([like the awesome money one]( to see how easily comparable a 2D surface is when considering values. 3D data representations are generally poorer than 2D because the human mind has a hard time grasping the actual size difference - to the mind, a cube with twice the length and width of another LOOKS twice as big, but, as I am sure OP knows, the actual volume is much greater, and only becomes greater in absolute terms as the size increases.

Not even just insurance fraud, but:
The people who will be the first to sign up for the insurance would also be those most likely to be involved in deeds where they will likely become raided and have property seized. The traditional view of federal seizure is that it offers some kind of disincentive to doing illegal activities. If you can get around a large portion of the risk (losing property), what disincentives you from doing the activity in the first place? Thus, those most likely to buy the insurance will be those most likely to be raided.
It's the same with health insurance: those who are habitually sick and in need of services will be the first to sign up, and those who never get sick will be the last. And since those who use the service the most join first, the insurance company is on the line for having to issue more payouts than it would normally be able to handle.

The deflationary currency/debt combination is a huge reason deflation is so damaging to real world economies - when deflation exists, there is less incentive to loan money for others to develop profitable businesses with. When there is less incentive to loan money, there is less demand for goods and services to create these businesses. When there is less demand for goods and services to create things, there is less demand for labor. When there is less demand for labor, there are less wages being paid. When there are less wages being paid, there is less demand for goods and services.
Etc etc. But this aspect of the nature of economies seems to be lost on many.

The goal posts simply keep changing when you try to discuss this stuff with anyone supporting BTC from an ideological standpoint - it's first a world changing currency, then when you call shenanigans on that aspect of it, it's now simply a payment processing tech, and shame on you for criticizing it - even if you have admitted that is a perfectly fine application of the tech. Let them think that PayPal is a currency, for all anyone should care. If that's what currency is to them, so be it, I suppose.

Value of time spent coding, working, etc, as long as it was done in the past, do not enter into economics questions. It is the classic "You have a ticket to a show, you've paid $20 for it, you lose it, do you still go to the show?" The answer is yes, you buy another ticket, because the lost ticket is not factored into economic decisions. The ticket isn't a $40 ticket, it's still $20, you just had a "sunk cost" in the lost ticket.

God forbid I have an opinion that may be based on things I have read and had explained to me in the past, and god forbid some people currently in the high seats might be right about some things.
Look, if you want to think deflation is a positive quality because a handful of people have made some money (real money, by the way, USD or whatever their chosen currency is to convert BTC to), go right ahead. But there are actually people that study economies, and I would rather listen to their decades of experience than listen to a bunch of people online who keep asking me for proof that deflationary currencies won't work, but give no models or theories on why deflationary currencies WOULD. All historical narratives point to deflation in general being bad, and a set supply of currency as being equally bad. Modern economies simply can't work with that - we've been off of the gold standard for quite some time, and a return to it would be highly damaging economically.

And thanks for the fyi, I totally didn't know the Fed was private. But it still is the arm of the US Gov't that handles monetary policies, so it really is only quasi-private. The rest of your post is tripe typical of people online who listen to too many soundbites and think they're way too smart and have "figured the world out".

There are a limited number of bitcoins - any fiat currency manipulating entity that buys billions of dollars of bonds etc and feels threatened by bitcoin (and they won't, but this is hypothetical) could easily start a campaign of simply buying all of the bitcoins that enter market.
Poof. Your new "currency" is purchased out from underneath you.
Not only that, but simply the speculative nature of it, and not being actually backed by anything that doesn't just help propagate it (mining) leads me to believe that it is every bit as "imaginary" as the fiat currency bitcoin supporters so deride... Except you don't have a military to back you up, or a country to bet against or for. So... It's really an abysmal currency, imo.
And that's what I get for actually kind of studying economics and monetary systems - the knowledge of a ponzi scheme when I see one. Except this one's founder can't seem to be found... How convenient! Madoff would be proud!

No, because math. I am seriously not going to educate people on monetary ideas when all of the information is out there in easily accessible format. Open courses online from top schools, wikipedia with full references, etc. Go read about why deflation doesn't work as a feature of currency. There is a reason the extremely rich haven't created deflationary systems yet - because they always fail, since it is the nature of deflationary currencies.
As of right now, a handful of people online talk to each other about this all the time and think the world just hasn't discovered this sleeping giant, but they are all delusional, because the nature of deflation means that, if everyone were to start using it, it would fail.

Just assuming a static supply (21 million) and increasing demand (either through increasing need for growing economic activity with static population growth, or simple increasing population and static amount of economic activity) this implies bitcoin will remain deflationary in nature, and is one of the primary reasons central banks exist and continue to "print money" as they say.

First, it isn't completely transparent - no one still knows who the legit creator(s) is/are.
Second, there's always a first for everything, and this reeks of strange speculative bubble.
Third, it's very true that the tech has potential, but it's going to be crushed by this neo-libertarian pipe dream of some open electronic currency. That literally will not work, AND if it somehow did, it would be horribly economically crippling, assuming you're a fan of "markets as innovators" models (i.e., the market produces economic activity, and this activity drives innovation through competition).

Wow. This is so wrong in many ways. Consider:
"Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all officially recognized final goods and services produced within a country in a year, or other given period of time."
...GDP is not a measure of spending, it is a measure of production in an economy.
You also can't use bitcoin as an indicator in a "real world laboratory" to see if the deflationary spiral exists (plenty of studies have confirmed deflationary spirals have happened in the past) because there are other far more popular currencies used to run the majority of the economies of the world, and these would correct any issues with bitcoin's natural deflation (in other words, if I have $6,000 USD, and $500 USD worth of BTC, I am not inclined to reduce my demand by much if at all, since I have solid currency to back my risky and smaller BTC investment).
19th century America achieved great levels of growth despite the gold standard due to technological progress during that time and the continuing transition from agrarian culture to service sector culture.
You define imprudence in spending, but not prudence. Using your definition of imprudence, I will take prudence to mean, "non-exaggerated spending", which is absolutely what any economist (or I should say financial advisor, because economists aren't exactly financial people, they are two separate fields) would tell you is most beneficial for an economy. Any financial sector consultant would tell you the best way to invest is with slow, steady returns, and not risky investments which spike in value and have the potential for crash or failure. Anything with a 10,000% gain in value would be seen as extremely risky and not even close to stable. Nobody other than parties in your own mind say that when people are prudent with finances, it ends up being bad for the economy.
Mild inflation is good for an economy because it incentivizes investment by those who hold LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL. Not your average joe going to work and collecting a paycheck, who will barely experience the negatives of inflation, as most of his pay is spent on things fairly immediately after receiving it - we are talking people with billions in assets. Inflation increases the opportunity cost of holding on to these billions, and encourages these capital holders to invest money in businesses, loans to those wishing to develop new businesses, etc.
The article your grandparents sent you is far more realistic than you would like. The best part is in the closing statements: "See, the technology of Bitcoin really is revolutionary, but the currency of Bitcoin is holding it back. In other words, Bitcoin really could have use as a payments system if it had a stable value. But it doesn't, so it's just a dotcom stock. And one that could be co-opted by banks that take its technology and use it with dollars instead."
That is so true. Great technology, poor implementation due to its speculative nature, and one day the tech will be used by large companies valuing it in stable currencies. There are so many fallacies in your post it makes my brain hurt, but you would really gain a lot from some non-intro econ courses.

Yeah but no one accounts of inflation when debt-fear-mongering, I've noticed that and find it interesting. When using real (i.e., rates and amounts adjusted for inflation), you'll see real debt levels were actually higher in the past, or at the same level as today.

Not really, and here is why:
The pre-existing and established copyright laws were, in the early days, still slightly unclear on digital content. There was a constant debate - is this content able to be under these laws? It's just ones and zeros, it isn't a physical good, it is kind of intangible. What defines one series of ones and zeros as something that can't be copied legally, and what can be copied legally? In the end, it has been established that yes, these are products that are backed by this law.
In much the same way here, if BTC is being used as a payments transfer, or in an exchange of some sort in order to promote criminal activity, the courts will eventually rule that yes, this can be confiscated, too - while it may not be a briefcase full of Ben Franklins, it is acting as one. As I've said before, if there were guns being exchanged for criminal activity or illicit goods, it could be argued that the guns were the medium of exchange.
I mean, most money isn't even actual hard cash - most are just numbers in an account somewhere, or, a series of ones and zeros. If the government can seize an individual's account in a bank due to criminal activity, it can surely seize BTC in the same manner.

If bitcoin ever would become a threat to, say, USD, all that would need to happen for the fed/Wall St/whoever to shut it down is to covertly or overtly buy bitcoins, and just... sit on them. Not do anything with them at all. Take more and more out of the equation. Hell, delete the wallet information. Eventually, bitcoin, with the limited number of them in existence, would cease to exist.
And that's best case scenario that any large entity will do if bitcoin threatens its existence. Worst case is it just keeps suffering these absurd price fluctuations because all it really is is a speculative asset, and can't ever truly be a currency because in order for it to take more market share/be used more, it has to constantly deflate, which inhibits use heavily. It will be its own worst enemy in the end.

...I am not conflating two things. I am saying SM manipulation concerning BTC is irrelevant considering the other issues that are much larger than skewing opinions and causing the relevant hysteria surrounding bubble mentalities. There are in reality a handful of people that can tank the market at any time with their activity - that alone should have people running away from BTC - but as we can see, there is no rational thought going into this at all, just some strange libertarian/anarchist fervor that BTC is a magic bullet to larger organizations that for the most part are ignoring it.

I didn't say it's unthinkable, but the fact you all care about that more than a handful of people holding a significant enough portion of total BTC that it can be damaging, without having to resort to social media, is very telling on how well thought out this whole thing is in everyone's minds around here.

Well, the net was initially created by firms and governments with the bankroll to fund such a large infrastructure based project. 
And then if you consider the fact that large funding of infrastructure projects falls perfectly in line with a Keynesian policy position, and the fact that Keynesianism was all the rage back then, it's not hard to see that the internet wouldn't exist today without the influence of Keynesianism policy decisions of the past. At best it would have been severely stunted in its growth.
The US highway system didn't come about because a bunch of individuals wanted to get around faster. It came about because governmental bodies said, "OK, this is what we need, and we need to get the funding to accomplish this." We still to this day wouldn't have a highway system if it was left up to non-gov't firms and individuals to create it.

@_date: 2013-12-30 22:25:21
In RE to your changes above: I am not certain how dividing denominations of a currency changes inflation or deflation of said currency - if tomorrow the US introduced the "half cent" as a movable coin, this wouldn't really change the value of the dollar, or the amount of goods it can purchase.
Also in RE to the above changes: In the long run, I am not certain how useful changing block rewards would be, considering it will eventually reach the point where no more can be made. This is the upper limit of bitcoins allowed, so changing reward schedules only helps change the short term game being played.
For definitions, I am using "long run" and "long term" to mean a future point in time where either 1) the maximum number of bitcoins has been achieved, or 2) rewards are no longer cost effective to mine (electricity/time/equipment costs are worth more than whatever the reward would be at margin, and the owner of the mining gear would be better off spending his computing power doing some other activity which would provide more profit).
@_date: 2013-12-30 11:05:21
No, deflation is bad, even when expected. It does nothing for an economy... Or at least, almost nothing. It would not be helpful to have deflationary currency.
The main problem is, people talking about it being some big new thing that will crush modern currencies say stuff like "TO THE MOON! HOW CAN IT NOT BE A CURRENCY WHEN ITS GONE UP IN PRICE 1000% THIS YEAR" and that just make me want to slam my hand in a car door repeatedly.

Dude, my reply was oozing sarcasm. The Fed is a 'private' entity, but really is only quasi-private, as it still gets appointments from elected officials.
Personally, I am glad it is private, as monetary policies don't need to feel the political pressure that fiscal policy does (and which is why our fiscal policies are trash, they have to be checked out to be appealing to the masses politically, since the masses are dumb, essentially... I mean the entire republican party is against what its constituents want, yet they still vote for them and their fiscal policy... That's a huge example of how fiscal policy is slaughtered by the political process... Not to even mention Obamacare being also slaughtered politically. Free healthcare? Riiiiiight. lol) It would be horrible to have monetary policy tied to election cycles and a public who knows nothing about the Fed, money, interest rates, inflation/deflation, etc etc.
From wiki:


EDIT: And no, inflation doesn't affect lower and middle classes the same as it affects those who hold billions and trillions in capital. Period. What DOES affect the lower and middle classes, however, is sticky wages, which luckily is slightly offset by sticky prices, but not really. As has been illustrated historically, wages remain sticky for much longer than prices do. But I mean I don't know anything about this stuff. Right? You guys here at bitcoin know it all, that's why deflationary currency is a great idea! (That was sarcasm, again, fyi)

Well, shame on me for your unfamiliarity with a topic, I suppose. Consider the following graph:
Now, if you are at the point 2 on the x axis, it certainly looks like the line is decreasing, correct? But in the long run, or x values over 4, it starts an increase that never ends. That is what I mean by long run - right now it may look like one thing, but the math appears to show it will end a certain way through simply extrapolating what we know of economies and currencies into the future based on the factors that make bitcoin what it is.
EDIT: I mean the graph on the left, btw. Not the one on the right. This was the first image I found to illustrate my point.

I already illustrated what SHOULD be your main cause for concern, but none of you ever will have any of it.

The amount of people using it directly affects its store of value capabilities. It is better as more people use it because more people are using it.

There are no deflationary currencies, because they don't create overall wealth or economic activity like slightly inflating currencies. That is why there are no examples - it's because they don't exist. If they DID work and COULD provide a benefit (i.e., were superior to slightly inflating currency), you can guarantee that those who deal with developing/controlling currencies would have created that system by now and would subsequently be just as rich as they are today.
Asking to provide an example of an inherently deflationary currency is like asking to provide an example of a perpetual motion machine. Perpetual motion machines don't exist because that is not how physics works. Inherently deflationary currencies don't exist because that is not how the physics of human resource exchange and utility (economics) works.

Botcoin the payment protocol could work, but will probably be crushed in time by too many users' hopes and attempts at making it a currency.
Solution to this problem is peg the value of a BTC to a dollar, make it truly P2P (a requirement for users to "mine" a very small minimum amount to use the network, not just a handful of people with high end gear), and remove the upper limit of total BTC - but all those who have invested all of this (real) money into mining gear will shit a brick if that were to happen, because then the speculative idiocy would end and they wouldn't get to become easy millionaires like they've been told they could.

No, it's evident you don't understand the topic you are talking about. For instance, what kind of risk-free return are they making? Who is the bank hoarding this "free money"? If you mean the Fed is making a return on the rates it is lending to the big banks, well, no, not really. The Fed is the monetary arm of the US Gov't, and they're not really looking to make a return - hell, just in inflation alone, if they're only making less than a percent interest, they're losing value continually (assuming inflation is above 1%, of course).

They'll do whatever they want because in a year or three or five some other suit will replace them and they'll have a bunch of money to make up for it and everyone will forget about them (or they'll just go work for some government department, or be on the board of another financial entity). Also I don't care about the "man on the street" and his feeling about this stuff - the man on the street on average works a crap job and doesn't think about anything more complex than how to reprogram his DVD player so he can continue to watch what media companies tell him reality should be.
I don't see how the above quotes directly relate to what I was saying, however. I am saying yes, the Fed is (semi) private, yes, they manipulate the currency, no it's not exactly bad that it's like this, due to a million different reasons, most of which being that the general populace knows nothing about monetary issues.
