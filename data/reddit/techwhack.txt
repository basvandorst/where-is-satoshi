Not kind of but i am creating an AI related to prediction by collecting data from previous bitcoin forks and events, including big price dips and ATH
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:00:32
Better sue then, before it gets late
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:00:08
So u don't know what they planned and did while listing BCH?
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:19:50
Fees is high because segwit implementation is not complete
You should look for exchanges with segwit -  here
If u have further questions please feel free to ask, but make sure to read that guide properly!
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:06:12

For exchanges - here u go  - 
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:55:03
Yes, there are many exchanges which does that
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:03:54
actually all legit exchanges have provided as well!
But they are not biased promoting BCH for their own favours like coinbase do
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:48:22
Yeah I would never use them!
But At Least they are noticing our efforts, isn't it ??
Probably there users are decreasing so they are afraid of losing their user base
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:08:20
 u should try localbitcoins
or the ones with segwit 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:07:24
1) its an attempt to make people stop using them
2)  they are already increasing fees for BTC transactions and promoting the BCH using bitcoin.com, bitcoin twitter etc.
3) they are already forcing newbies in an indirect way to change and invest in BCH, and that can be easily seen on 4) that comment was only for newbies and who don't know about coinbase shit! 
hoping u guys are not a coinbase supporter
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:56:18

As i said bitcoin bull run will attract a lot of new guys to invest in bitcoin, that twitter account have a large number of followers, they can easily mislead new users and have them buy their shit coin!
the pro users need to remain active especially in the time period of bull run and keep reporting them or there fraud-lent activities will keep on increasing
@_date: 2018-05-05 16:34:34
Here comes a hater.
If u support bitcoin core then spend ur time reporting that account rather than trolling
@_date: 2018-06-05 07:18:27
wait what?
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:02:48
You should report it to the local police, if you remember the face and some other info about those scammers
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:27:45
