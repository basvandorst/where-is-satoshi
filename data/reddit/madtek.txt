Will any mention of Blockstream Core increasing block size to 2MB result in censoring ? There would be no such thing as Classic if Core would please scale up to 2MB.

It begs the question: why did the inventor include signatures in the first place if they are such a waste of block size ? Could it have been to allow more potential future 'apps' and uses of the block chain ? And why did the first implementation have a 32MB block size if large blocks are so terrible ? My understanding is that a temporary limit was added because there were only a handful of nodes and miners back in the day , and this was necessary to stop a script from generating millions of bloat transactions , which would not be a problem today ? I read what Satoshi says and it was something like "the block size can be simply increased when required , it can be phased in like 'when &gt;150,0000 block size increa ' blaa blaa blaa. Why should the fundamental block structure be changed with SegWit when all that's needed is is 3 or 4 lines of code changed to increase the block size to 2MB? I don't understand , surely if the inventor of this protocol was smart enough to invent it in the first place then surely he must also know what the heck he's talking about with bigger block sizes ?

Just think , the most powerful computer system ever designed and built by human beings has effectively a massive 1MB of 10 minute cache memory and is  capable of - wait for it - a staggering 3 transactions per second. Does anybody else see the problem here ?

I kinda get the idea it's the other way around. Blockstream Core will lose out if their sidechains don't even work or are unnecessary if bitcoin scales linearly simply with larger blocks as expected by the Inventor of the protocol.

Was the block size limitation supposed to be permanent or temporary  ? Was that also an oversight or was the network designed to handle 8 small web pages of data every 10 minutes ?
