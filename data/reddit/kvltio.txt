Most of the time, well-reasoned FUD doesn't work against myopic greed-driven crypto-zealots, so other measures are taken. Ever been involved with someone suffering from an incredibly self-destructive delusion? And you get so frustrated by their lack of awareness at their irrational, suicidal behavior that you just want to smack them? Since we FUDders actually give a shit about humans, and not money or coins or greed or gains or lambos, we spend our time trying to explain to you that YOU ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AN HYPNOTIC SPELL.
WAKE THE FUCK UP.

You've unintentionally helped to enslave yourself and the rest of humanity to the Blockchain Egregore. The only option you have remaining is to join KVLT and to thereby escape an eternity of torture.
