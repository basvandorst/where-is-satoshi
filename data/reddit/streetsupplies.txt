# Street Supplies!
We're a 501(c)(3) public charity registered in the United States. We are a small, non-religion based charity that serves the homeless population in Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs, Colorado. We do not pay a salary or cover personal expenses with donated funds, every satoshi we receive is turned into a donation and handed directly to a friend in need. 
Every Tuesday and Thursday night we visit the streets of Colorado and hand out food, socks, and survival gear to every person in need that we can find. We have been operating for two years and we typically send around 30 people home with 2-3 meals each shift. We don't pay anyone a salary, we don't spend money on advertising, and exactly 0% of your donation will be spent on anything that is not given to a homeless person on the cold streets of Colorado.
If you include your email address with the donation I will be happy to provide people who donate pictures of the smiling recipients (assuming they agree). Typically we spend monetary donations on tents and sleeping bags, your donation could literally save a life this winter.

We currently have seven open sleeping bag requests from people who sleep outside every night.
Edit: On a side note, if any of our friends from 2015/2016 are here please send me a message! We had two early adopters who told us non-stop about Bitcoin. They conveniently disappeared as the rocket launched to the moon, we just want to say "thanks" for getting us started and hear about how you are doing now!
