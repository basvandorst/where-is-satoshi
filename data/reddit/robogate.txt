Shouldn't have used romit (re-branded Robocoin technology). Get you coins and run away.

Ask him how the Recycler model is coming along. It turns out they never manufactured one. It only existed on paper.
Also ask him how many traditional ATM manufacturers they have integrated their Vomit (romit) software into. Here is a spoiler. It's zero. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 20:24:47
Jordan Kelly is Robocoin. They tried to rebrand to Romit after Robogate 2.0 but with a name that sounds like Vomit, I don't see how it did any good.

I dub thee, Robogate 3.0
@_date: 2014-11-08 02:48:54
You must not know any better. Regrettably, I own a Lamassu.
@_date: 2014-11-07 05:28:16
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:24:04
Yes, i'm getting a strong scent of bullshit. I suggest an independent survey of Lamassu operators.
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:16:52


This is the truth!

I agree with you. The heard mentality and passion for all things anon have really blown the biometrics thing out of proportion. 
Regardless of the weak logic that the opposition to biometrics is rooted in, the consumer sensitivity is real and any company wanting to work in Bitcoin needs to acknowledge that and craft their product, marketing, and PR accordingly. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:02:17
Lamassu is not a viable alternative. Their backend is currently shit and they commit so few developers to the project that it will be shit for a long time. 
While Lamassu is no Robocoin, they still fail on so many levels. The General Bytes option seems to be the most viable alternative. They could have shit software too though. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:13:22
Make sure to see their back-end software first hand. There is much to desire. 
You should look into a satoshi1 by GenesisCoin. 
* $5,800
* No stand needed
* manufactured by a global company who can back up their product
* back-end features that put lamassu to shame
* multi-crypto support
* the list goes on

If there are enough transactions, definitely worth it.

I sense a Lamassu-gate on the horizon.

it's this guy...
all about this...
@_date: 2014-10-22 14:00:21
Jordan can't leave a good apology alone, takes jabs at the former operator.

Robocoin will never live down the palm scanner. A monumental product mistake.
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:31:56
IMOH it doesn't matter and it's not my point. All that matters is that the Bitcoin community is hyper sensitive to any and all Biometrics. To ignore that, or to be unaware of it, shows that Robocoin is and always has been disconnected from their end users.
Yes they should provide KYC options and AML for their operators, but biometrics are above and beyond. To make the palm scanner a centerpiece of their marketing strategy locked them into a future destined for failure. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:42:32


That is absolutely true but it's much more than that. The marketing produced by Robocoin is the slimiest shit ever. Talking shit about other ATM manufacturers, lies about their products, and generally douchey overall. Based on their blogs and all the marketing that comes our of Robocoin (not to mention the epic failure of the PR), all that content reeks of an ethicless Jordan Kelly. Who let's this guy near the press? Talking to him, you get the sense that you're talking to someone who only cares about making a sale at any cost. 
For Robocoin to have any chance of survival, Jordan Kelly must go. Jordan stands amongst some of the most despised names in the industry. 
* Mark Karpeles
* BFL Josh
* Jordan Kelly
The list goes on...

Just a play on how he says in the article that he invented the Bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2014-11-21 08:15:02
True, the numbers are very selective and their product is not what they make it out to be. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 14:03:55
Worst ATM software backend, hands down. Only an army of open source developers could save it. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:43:18
Command line band-aids are no substitute. Even Robocoin has totals available in their back-end UI.

We at robogate are following this news closely. All indications are that Robogate III will be officially declared sometime this weekend. Stay tuned. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:57:40
This is still Robogate 2.0. Please leave defining of new versions of Robogate to the experts.
Besides that; I am robogate, and I approve the rest of this message. :)

It's an anal, vaginal (or penal), and saliva sample all in one. They cross reference DNA so no A2M cheats allowed.

Boom. Robogate III is official. 
This document deserves it's own thread.

If you're asking reddit for this advice, you've already failed. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:32:05
These reports are consistent with what we're hearing from the field. Stay tuned to the next puff of PR smoke timed with the announcement at ATMIA. 
No, Robocoin. You don't know the ATM industry or the operators except that they are desperate for new revenue in a shrinking market segment. After you fuck them, there will be no one left to fuck but yourselves.
@_date: 2015-02-14 15:04:13
Robocunts are shameless bullshitters so full of shit that they can't see how much ruin and embarrassment they have/will cause themselves as well as the bitcoin industry.

Bruce Fenton is the most overrated "Leader" in the Bitcoin community. I don't know why anyone would use the word leader to describe him. He gained recognition by preaching anti-regulation to the Bitcoin echo chamber and everyone lapped it up. But anyway, he does seem to be headed downhill in public opinion.
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:13:23
The d-baggery is strong in this one.

They're going down in flames either way. I don't think they need any help with that. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 15:20:01
I know what the facts are. I'm just tired of seeing you post this same shit every time someone talks about Bitcoin ATM regulation.
