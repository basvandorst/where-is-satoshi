That was funny as hell though lol

Ah yes, drugs, where there are no victims except when people are arrested by the Gov.  I mean other than that, there are no bad things that ever happen from people doing drugs...  
Edit:  Also, total thumbs up on comparing someone helping people do hard drugs and a group of people who helped slaves escape.  Totally morally the same, just brilliant...

Poor libertarians.  Anything the government does is automatically evil.   Is there any kind of contraband that causes people to deserve "violence" against them?  
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:59:08
So you think meth heads won't be really unpredictable and likely to commit crimes if there was no threat of arrest for using it or selling it though?

Why's that?  What would be a good attempt?  It's a simple question though, do you think they won't commit crime and the only crime they currently commit is because they fear "violence and rape cages?"

I totally agree we need change, but your anarchy bullshit is just that, bullshit.  Grow up.

I mean seriously, we aren't talking about the people buying the drugs, but rather that this guy facilitated it. I think dealers of hard drugs should be locked up and the users should be treated as mental health issues.  Cocaine, heroin, opium, pcp, all the other synthetic shit out there in my opinion, don't care about a politician, should be illegal.  The victim is the person doing the drugs that make their lives a waste.  So yes, I believe there is also a victim in those trades of contraband.  Just because you willingly make yourself a victim or don't recognize it, doesn't mean you aren't a victim.

Are you a robot and glitching?  Is this like when CD's skip?  I asked what would be a good attempt, couldn't you at least answer that since you don't want to admit that meth heads are likely to commit crimes?

Love the "faries in black dresses" line too.  You got some grade A, original comments and thought processes lol.

Here, let me change it, go snort a huge line of coke.  Better?

How many questions can you not answer tonight?  
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:46:51
And I mean YUGE!

So what happens in a decade?  People can only use bitcoin and if you don't have any, you starve?  Like my job wouldn't start paying in bitcoin if that was the only accepted form of pay?  Or like what, I'm gonna wish I got in early like google or something?  Just saw an article that said if you bought like a $100 worth 7 years ago you would be worth $72mil (which I say bullshit too, try getting that much).  So what?  What's the huge blindside? 
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:55:55
So if no one was ever arrested for doing hard drugs like Meth, there would be nothing bad from it?
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:19:08
Nope, not using bitcoin, saw the title on the front page and clicked and then said, holy shit, how dumb are people, and here we are...

Not really sure why I'm talking to an anarchist who tries to pretend to have credibility by pretending to be libertarian.  Have a great life person.

You just said this guy wasn't committing a crime, so what could he turn him in for?  Ulbricht ran a major drug selling market, that is illegal...  You hire hitmen when you are a major player in the drug market, not when you think you aren't doing anything illegal.  Come on...
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:49:35
Rape cage again, so funny.  I believe the dealer who ruins people's lives and damages the community should be punished, aka put in prison.  I believe the users should receive mental health help.  If the dealer is also a user, he should get mental health help in prison.  And yes, I believe a government should try to protect the health of its citizenry. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 03:46:01
Your beginning example is sooooo off base.  The dude was facilitating drug deals at a large scale...  That's illegal...  I mean, if it turned out Barrett Auctions were really letting people sell coke in their cars, they would be guilty to as accomplices.  Just because he created a new way to do the same thing doesn't make it a brand new crime...  
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:04:39
If you're honest, you'll admit that you wouldn't want a meth head in your house around your belongings, let alone come across one with a gun needing a fix, because you know they are very likely to commit other crimes besides using meth and/or buying it.
