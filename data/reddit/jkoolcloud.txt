Reason 1 does not equate bitcoin &amp; crypto supply but simply states that dollars will be chasing more crypto assets and Bitcoin will have to complete for the same dollar.  
Reason 2: not all have profits, what about those that bought above 10K. Do they have profits?  
Reason 3: A lot of demand also came in due to ICO explosion. If money leaves it will leave all crypto and not just ICOs\-\&gt;Bitcoin.   
Reason 5: Responses  on this thread proves that most are bulls. Not a single bear.

Cryptos will most likely collapse in value. In deflation value of all assets go down.

Well historical perspectives are in the charts and publically available. The fundamentals for BTC are probably worse today than in 2013\-2014. Bitcoin dominance is dropping and the trend is down \-\- check out the charts. I would also venture to say that the lion share of institutional money will flow into ICOs, STOs \(or some version of it\) decentralized apps, etc and not Bitcoin due to a profit potential and ability to control. Big money will have little interest in BTC \(other than trading or mining it\) due to lack of control. So fundemantals are not in BTC's favor. I know all Bitcoiners want  the price to go up and up but it also reduces its use and adoption. Why trade something if it goes up? And if it does it wont be a good form of exchange \-\- just a store of value.. But isnt it completely against what Bitcoin was all about?  Anyway we can debate about where the price will be in the future. But I do agree we might be in for a prolonged bear market in crypto and Bitcoin...
Also note that stable prices does not mean BTC failed, it is the opposite. But I think hoping for perpetual price appreciation is kind of childish. Show me a single asset with a perpetual appreciation \(minus inflationary factors\)...Point is that Bitcoin is already a huge success and it does need 50K to stay that way. I think there are too many that think bitcoin is going to 100K which is probably a huge reason why it never will.

Not really.. Every commodity in world has a capped supply \(gold, silver, oil\) yet it does not lead to uncapped price increase. This is a silly assumption that you wish happens but wont. You also have to consider demand.

Similar concept, but something that can be used by non developer or non technical person who does not know SQL. Also navigating through gocypher builds out the queries automatically.
