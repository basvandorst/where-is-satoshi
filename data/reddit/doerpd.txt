In the past they've only issued 1099-Ks, which were for payments processed for merchants. Not sure what they'll do going forward. Inquire with them?

It should but I'm not certain of that. The channels operate viz. smart contracts which are enforced by the Bitcoin/Litecoin/segwit-enabled blockchain.

Different explorers have their own metrics for filtering out transactions. Sometimes they may not have received the broadcasted transaction.

Each transaction occupies a certain space on the blockchain, the ledger that's distributed across nodes in the Bitcoin network. The more space you occupy, the higher fees you pay. The faster people want to get into that ledger, the higher fees they pay to get into that ledger.
The fees are currently high because there are too many transactions vying for the limited block space, and the senders (of the transactions) are "bidding" higher fees to get into the blockchain as fast as possible. The block space isn't big enough to accommodate the types of transactions* that are coming in, so the fees keep rising. 
Eventually there will be equilibrium in what people are willing to pay to get into that block space. That equilibrium has not been achieved yet.
* Legacy transactions vs. SegWit transactions. The latter can consume upto ~50-70% less space than the former. SegWit adoption is low at the moment.

Service offerings for their network will suffer aswell. This is precisely why wasting block space is being avoided right now at BTC. Just needs to be said alot more.
Wallets need to index UTXO at least. Block explorers need to index the entire thing. Costs are enormous; no free services?

that's not how fees work. Amount of money sent doesn't determine the fees.

1 ver(?) per byte. The smallest denomination.

This is native SegWit. Good stuff!

1) Its scale depends on the number of "channels" that can be opened, which means number of transactions in a given block. You can exhaust the network and at least delay opening/closing of channels by exhausting block space.
2) It doesn't provide "infinite" scale (does anything?), but it provides order(s?) of magnitude better scale.
3) You can extend channels indefinitely. Either party can close the channel at will.
4) How will it to scale to everyone? How would paper scale to everyone if we run out of cotton/trees/plastic/whatever the materials used?
One step at a time. Address space in Bitcoin isn't infinite either, but it's large enough for now. Earth isn't scalable for human life either at current growth.

Ready-made tools for P2WSH-over-P2SH type addresses are scarce at best at this time. Here's one way to do it: 
Keep in mind the Bitcoin Core software removed the createwitnessaddress endpoint in 0.14(?), but it probably will return in later iterations.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:54:53
In reality it's far cheaper, but yeah that's the case if miners mine that fee. They're already at roughly 2mb to 3mb blocks on an hourly basis.

New technologies are like kids. They don't start running marathons the moment they're born. It takes time to build them up enough so they can sustain whatever you throw their way.
Need the kid to focus harder? Two options: hourly shots of caffeine that'll wreck his sleep pattern, or meditation over weeks for a longer lasting effect. Caffeine is what most short-sighted folks might pick, but not if you care about the child's longevity.
Have some patience; we'll get there. If you can contribute to do it faster, go ahead: github.com/bitcoin.

You can do one or more of the following: 
1) Wait for the network congestion to subside, and let the transaction confirm on its own, or 
2) Use ViaBTC.com's free tool to see if they can "accelerate" your transaction, or 
3) Use pushtx.btc.com and pay them to include your unconfirmed transaction in the next Bitcoin block they mine.

When you send funds to an institution that verifies you, you automatically negate your "no ID" condition. Whoever sends the funds to those accounts can know who you are, so why not just give the sending institution your ID?

I'm not aware of the specifics of their filtering mechanism.
An example of filtered transactions is: use of non-default values in the Bitcoin Core software. For instance, the "max ancestors in mempool" parameter defaults to 25, meaning there can be a maximum of 25 unconfirmed transactions following a given chain of UTXO. Some explorers, like chain.so, may choose to set a higher value for the maximum allowed unconfirmed ancestors, which would make some transactions not visible on other block explorers, unless they too have relaxed the said parameter's value.
Other instances of this include: minimum fee per kb of data, mempool size (defaults to 300mb), etc.
Keep in mind that if a service uses non-default parameters, they should be re-broadcasting unconfirmed transactions when necessary to make sure the transactions are received by the miners for inclusion in future blocks.
