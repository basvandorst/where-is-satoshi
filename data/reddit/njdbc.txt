Thank you very much. Just completed that, it won't take more than an hour to transfer over right?

If I were to hook up my credit card to coinbase, would that work? Is it safe? I would delete the card after I'm done of course

Anonymous is good. Let's say I'm purchasing goods worth $60. Would a $70 gift card be good?
Also, I just figured this would be the easiest way to go it tbh. If there's an easier way than using giftcards, let me know 
Thanks

Is this true that I will lose money with this?

Have the 9 cents on Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:32:38
Oh shit, btc is so confusing lol. How do I get rid of 9 cents? Won't let me transfer to my blockchain

Great. Thanks for all the info. Coinbase seems really easy to use, so I may just use that. Thanks

Bitcoin would be way less confusing for a noob if there weren't 1000 websites lmao
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:24:13
Copy and paste what exactly? Sorry new at btc lol

So once I used Paxful, what do I do with it? Do I transfer it somewhere or can I just pay for shit from there? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:53:12
Honestly I'm going to use Coinbase for now (even tho it's not really anonymous) just because it seems like the easiest to use 
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:25:27
Will I lose btc doing that? 
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:35:28
Thanks. About how long will it take to transfer over?
