If Coinbase ever want to be a public company they will have to lift their game. CEO has a legal responsibility to maximize shareholder return. 
So they will have to either make users pay the fees or reduce the amount of fees they are paying. 
Making users pay fees could lose them customers, so reducing fees makes sense.
and apparently they have some interest in going public:- 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:04:16
Fees are per byte. About 250 bytes in normal transaction. Small value teansactions are not cost effective while network is overloaded. This is what lightning network seeks to solve.

I'm guessing $10 went in fees. As soon as the transaction is sent it is deducted from your wallet. Unconfirmed on blockchain means its been accepted by the network but waiting to be confirmed into a block. It's similar to VISA, when you make a payment it gets accepted almost immediately, but it doesn't  get confirmed in your account for days.

@_date: 2018-01-15 10:58:54
Agreed. A lot of childish whingers complaining about not very much. Roger has done more for Bitcoin than most, so he deserves some grace to follow what he believes in. In the grand scheme of things it won't matter if he's right or wrong. 
But Coinbase really deserve a few solid smacks over the head with a maggoty cat for their failure to batch transactions. WTF did they spend all that VC money on ? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:18:22
Every block that gets mined currently has 12.5 bitcoin that the successful miner can claim + they get to claim the transaction fees. 
Transaction fees are 'worth it', because basically enough people believe that they are, if they didn't, then they wouldn't pay them.

Segwit splits transactions into witness data and transaction data, so weight is used as a measure of equivalency between legacy &amp; segwit transactions for the purpose of managing block size. 
It's not really something users should have to worry about as long as wallets calculate the correct fee for Seqwit or legacy transactions.
here is some detail if you want to dive in

Check twice, send once :)  
I know how you feel, I did it last month. There is really only two things you have to get right. 
1. Store your 20 words in a safe place. 
2. Make sure you send your coin to the correct address.
Slow down, remember to breathe :) 
I double check the first &amp; last 4 characters of each address just as a safety check. 
I sent a small transaction first just to make sure. 
Sending from non-segwit address to segwit address works fine - so if you're moving coins may as well put them into a segwit address.

for small amounts of Bitcoin many people are better off to leave it on (a reputable) exchange rather than relying on their own security management. Spending $95 on a ledger for &lt;$500 in Bitcoin is crazy from a financial point of view.

Looks politically motivated more than anything else.  If the minted Bitcoin+fees is being sold outside of China, (very likely since Chinese exchanges have been closed), then effectively China is getting a cash inflow to pay the mining costs.

So, the first time someone loses money, what can they say ? The devs have already said it's a likely outcome. On the flip side, the trolls have been saying lightning is vapourware cos it's not on mainnet. Some people are going to find something negative to say no matter what.
I think it's a great idea to test on mainnet, with small money and plenty of warnings. Let the games begin! We could do with a bit of fun for a change!

Virtually impossible Coinbase CEO did not know Coinbase was effectively spamming the network. 
Its a CEO's job to ask questions like why are our transaction fees so high and what can we do about it.
It's not like batching is some new thing or even complicated. 
I smell market manipulation of epic proportions. 
Onboard tons of new users, pump price (control availability of cash vs coin on exchange), overload network with transactions, list bcrash, crash price.

would be nice to see some example calcs in the article to give an indication of the potential benefit, some of us are not educated in hieroglyphic math :)
1 input transaction, saving = 0
3 inputs = ~64bytes vs ~219bytes (saves 155bytes/tx) 
140 inputs = ~64bytes vs ~ 10Kb (saves 10KB/tx)
My back of envelope calcs...
So, if average transaction has 3 inputs &amp; current avg ~1800 transactions/block, this =~279K saving per block (1800 x 155 bytes = 279K). 
Seems like a lot. Is my math ~ correct ? 
Therefore, average transaction size could drop from ~555 bytes to ~400 bytes, which means potential increase of ~700 transactions per 1 MB block, with no downsides. 
Sounds good to me, what's the estimated delivery date ? 
What impact does Segwit have on this ?, ie; is this Schnorr aggregation thingy provide a benefit on top of Seqwit benefit, or is it negated for Segwit transactions ?
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:10:54
Why foolish ? They can limit their potential losses. Worst case is they get great low cost marketing.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:57:53
An amount of bitcoin that is considered smaller than what makes any financial sense.
I'm not 100% on this but, I think that if you keep a few addresses each with say only 1 satoshi in your wallet and send the entire funds from the wallet as one Tx, the coins will appear to go from the wallet (depending on the wallet you use), but they won't be accepted by the network. You can recover the coins later :-).

Tether market cap does not equal or even represent current demand for bitcoin.
At the very most you might say its latent potential demand for all crypto, but really it's more likely shitcoin demand, since the tether partners are all the big shitcoin exchanges.

Firstly it's not just a matter of the devs increasing the blocksize, it requires more than 50% of miners to agree also. The miners could also decide without the devs, as it is a simple parameter change. 
The devs and many others, just didn't want to make the change any sooner than necessary. As much as this approach has short term pain, I think it is a wiser approach for the long term.

@_date: 2018-01-24 23:48:12
thanks. 
So a 3 input nonSegwit transaction there is a saving of  ~155 bytes in the 1MB blockspace.
Whereas a 3input Segwit transaction there is no saving in the 1MB blockspace, but there is a saving of ~155 bytes in the witness space.

No idea re LTC, I don't use Coinbase, but the method above works for any segwit challenged exchange.

that one might have gone over its head :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:00:02
yep. The block size debate, which triggered the forks, has put the brakes on price for a while, which is actually a good thing, the entire crypto scene was/is not ready for mass adoption yet, too much growth would have been a disaster. The forks also created a lot of publicity and people were keen for 'free money', so this also contributed to price runup.

It's not just Coinbase that are struggling to keep up, I have been using Coinjar for years and they are not answering tickets even after 1 month, whereas they used to take a day or so.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:30:47
I tried a Legacy to Segwit transaction with 223Sat/byte fee and it got stuck. I'm guessing my segwit wallet calculated the fee as a seqwit transaction, but the network treats it as a legacy transaction. My wallet fee calcs have always worked fine for legacy transactions.

thanks - though core isn't for most users in any case
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:39:14
Maybe it is. But at least it's a ponzi scheme with a fixed supply, doesn't charge interest on the currency issued and users have a say. 
FIAT money on the other hand is where a select few get to mint unlimited $, charge interest on it, massively devalue it over time, control &amp; monitor every transaction you make and then claim it's better than a ponzi scheme. 
Which system do you think is best for the majority ?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:16:57
LOL - banks putting themselves out of business! 
If you really want to annoy them. Buy one of their shares (Lakestone are owned by County Bank Corp) which will cost you about $40. First off the cost to them to manage your holding is astronomical relative to the value of your shareholding. As a shareholder you have all sorts of legal rights you don't have as a customer. Like going to the AGM and very politely asking difficult questions about their stone age approach to crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:11:22
it will help stabilise the price, which some people say is a good thing. Aside from that if you can pick the highs and lows you'll make a profit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:58:23
It has had a massive runnup to 20K, everyone was expecting a crash, someone farted, price droppped. Patience. This is nomral bitcoin price volatility, all part of the fun.

It will clear eventually, you won't lose your funds, but you can't increase the fee once you hit send.

Coinjar &amp; Independent Reserve are both easy to sign up for &amp; get verified, fees are reasonable &amp; you save the cost of international FIAT transfer. Coinjar doesn't support every new coin but did BCH and BTG, ie; they seem to pick those with reasonable value. With a wallet you have to rely on Ledger or Trezor to provide support for the new coin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:39:22

The government didn't actually do anything. The tax office simply issued guidance and they had no choice but to apply the existing laws.

There has been such an army of trolls screaming insolvency (which might turn out to be true) but they might just be the very people behind the various attacks. 
Plenty of free advice saying cash has a better chance of being recovered than BTC (so many experts here on Japanese insolvency law and inside knowledge about what contractual obligations MtGox have, it's no wonder Mark has not made any comment on this topic). 
Massive FUD mixed with some truth, so people panic. 
there is typical activity across all currencies, not just USD therefore I doubt they would have time to bother faking across multiple currencies - therefore fair to assume there is real trade going on. Insider trading - it's an easy accusation to make - harder to prove. Probably very illegal in Japan. 
I had cash trapped on Gox, figured it was either staying trapped, lost,....or a good opportunity to buy cheap coin &amp; support the price at the same time. Fingers crossed :)
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:08:48

There is also this old fashioned thing called a telephone ;-) It's much more personal than an email and often easier to sort things out - of course it's good to also put it in writing. Fair chance Mr Kobayashi speaks English since it's an international case. (Sure our wonderful regulators wouldn't put someone on an international case that doesn't speak English....). 
Don't panic - they're not lost - and they are a lot less temporarily unavailable than my Mt Gox coins :)

AFAIK in Australia you can only claim a tax deduction if it's a registered charity. So if getting that receipt is a criteria for donation, then aren't your ideologies dictating that you only donate to charities that enable you a tax deduction ? 
Personally I see nothing wrong with getting something in return for helping someone, whether it's a good feeling or something material doesn't matter. 
I get telemarketers calling me during work hours constantly asking for donations to various charities. I can't support all of them, so now I tell them if they don't accept Bitcoin I'm not interested.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:17:35
I took most of my coin out of Gox early enough, left some cash &amp; coin on there for trading. I knew the risk, no point crying over it. 
Using the same logic I shouldn't trade with the USA either, especially after Lehman brothers etc.

Very true. Bitcoin has been under concerted sustained attack and even at the peak of uncertainty with MtGo the price is remarkably stable.
Lots of work for the community to do before we get to the win stage. Most people are a bit starry eyed about what that will actually take.

@_date: 2014-02-20 23:47:52

I lost much more on GFC than Gox and didn't get 1c back as regulators did nothing.

Well gone guys...or girls whichever the case may be.
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:37:34
They did say the api was giving out wrong information and shut it off. 
i had coins stuck, they were returned, yes it was very annoying waiting to find out what happened. I can't say I've been happy with their lack of communication, but plenty of companies have bad communication and survive just fine. 
Given the army of trolls against Gox, the media spotlight &amp; the US Gov, anything they say is often turned against them, it's usually better not to say anything in those circumstances. They probably weren't sure what damage had actually been done so even more reason not to say anything.
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:43:32
Great article. Nice to see some balance. Too many trolls screaming for blood without getting all the facts, most of them never run a business, let alone one with the complexities of Mt Gox or the intense media spotlight they're under.

I bought some BTC at near the peak of the last 'bubble' in April 2013, I managed to stay on the roller coaster for the few nervous months it took to gain new highs. No-one knows what future will be, but back then I took the approach that I believed in the theory, so stay with the program. I also took the advice of only investing what I could afford to lose - even so it was a hell of a ride. Hope you make it through all good.

Speaking as one of those with dozens of BTC on Gox, MtGox is a great example of why government regulation doesn't work. With millions of pages of regulation at their disposal, they are doing....nothing. 
I bet if this was hurting the government, instead of investors, they'd find a regulation in no time flat and enforce it vigorously.

If you look at selected individual transactions you can draw any conclusion you want. 
If you hold FIAT over time, you are guaranteed to lose more of it's value the longer you hold it - look at the overall cost for both &amp; then compare.
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:40:39
Yes, it would be nice if they made it possible for users to verify that Gox have their funds, warm and fuzzy, but I'm guessing it would open another possibility for hackers to steal coins - they are probably the No.1 target in the world for theft, if it was me I'd limit the risk. 
It would also be nice for banks to prove they are solvent and not exposed to massive derivatives exposure :-) but apparently it's OK for them to trade with &lt;10% reserves - it's all good...until there's a bank run.

There are already plenty of laws &amp; regulations, domestic &amp; international, civil &amp; criminal that cover this type of loss whether it's Bitcoins or Banana's doesn't really matter. 
The MtGox case is nothing new. Fraud via email or fraud via post, should not require new laws to cover fraud via email - unless the existing laws were badly done.
If the rumours about MtGox 'lost' coins are even close to true, Mark is in a ton of trouble with the law.

Use what power they do have, sort it out. Can't be the hard.
Otherwise Japanese government will lose face. Knowing the Japanese they are probably too scared to go in and sort it, probably worried they may mistake and lose face, that's more likely the real reason no action appears to have been taken.
I don't know Japanese law, but theft &amp; fraud etc. are still theft &amp; fraud whether it's a cryptocurrency or a banana, neither need to be in the legislation for it apply. 
I doubt US legislation specifically states it's OK to murder people in other countries using drones, but it doesn't seem to be an issue. When a government wants to do something strongly enough, it just does it.

Good article. But paying taxes on Bitcoin is no more difficult than other capital gain items. Last year I simply downloaded the  CSV file from gox and sent it to my accountant - who had never heard of Bitcoin, he did his homework, he sent me my return with no further questions and paid the tax due. 
If I was doing my own return, of course it would be harder - as it would be for all non-Bitcoin activities also, tax returns are a PITA, bitcoin or not.
  
@_date: 2014-06-05 08:35:48
The biggest investment mistakes I've made were on the advice of people with degrees in finance. The biggest gains when I ignored them and followed my own ideas. 
My wife wanted me to put all her money into bitcoin when it had crashed down to about $70 in 2013. I refused (I'd put 1% of my wealth in at that stage).... She hasn't given me a hard time over it, but I've given myself a much harder time over investment opportunities that I passed over because of being too cautious.

Good answer - though some people will complain about Gox no matter what happens.

proving that they have x quantity of Bitcoin, proves nothing and only provides more fuel for the AnitGox militia.
The community should be venting at US Government for interfering, at the hackers for DDOS'ing and thieving etc, not just at Gox management for not trying hard enough.

Legislation applies to everyone, not just lawyers. 
Sometimes I wish it was the case as my wife is a lawyer and I could tell her that certain legislation applies to her and not to me :)
Legislation is usually written by lawyers &amp; keeps lawyers employed and everyone else uncertain or mistaken. Regulations are pretty much the same. 
Legislation &amp; regulation is only as good as the integrity &amp; common sense of those enforcing and controlling - too often found lacking and the problem is amplified by giving government protection to people abusing their power &amp; position or those simply well meaning but incompetent.
There are plenty of cases where legislation &amp; regulations work well, (eg; most road rules) but that doesn't automatically mean more regulation are a good thing. 
As one that's lost substantial coin on Gox, no, I'm not asking for more regulations for Bitcoin.

Great post. I can't say this is balanced in it's own right, but it does help balance all the anti Gox shills on here. So many of these antiGoxers claim they are no longer on Gox, but if so, why so many nasty posts ? What happened to our lovely Bitcoin community spirit ?
My guess is market manipulation and they've succeeded well. There is just as much buying as selling happening at prices that even 6 months ago would be solid. 
Mark has an opportunity here to come out of this a triumphant hero, or a recalcitrant cad - but very few have any idea of what he's really dealing with - we know but a small part at best, law suits, FEDS, hackers - nah wouldn't want his day for all the money he's made. 
My guess is there is a ton of market manipulation going on (and that's fine by me, win or lose) a bit of truth fanned into a fire and a bunch of stuff we just don't know. Give it a month and see what happens - chill :)

On one hand I don't like what happened to her, but on the other, she was the one that failed to pay a debt that she took on. It was her responsibility to pay it - WITHOUT the loan company having to go to the expense and inconvenience of having to chase her down and force her to pay. So, she copped a small inconvenience of not having access to part of her money till she finally did the right thing and paid her dues. Put yourself in the lenders shoes for a minute and think how would you like it if you were nice enough to lend money to someone, they agree to pay it back on time without hassle, ....then they don't and you have to fuck around to get your money back.

The thing is that if they only froze the amount owing, there is no penalty for failing to pay back the loan on time as she agreed to do. I'm guessing they freeze everything as a way to discourage people from failing to live up to their agreements. Because she has failed to pay on time, the loan company had a to pay for a law firm, the law firm had to use some government department, which cost the taxpayer, then the bank had to pay someone to freeze her accounts. All these parties, who did nothing wrong, all had to pay for her bad behaviour, so why shouldn't she be penalized, since she was the one the did the wrong thing. Personally I'd seriously consider to dump the gf, before she treats you with the same disrespect.

There are some serious flaws in the current money system that threaten the survival of banks. Many have failed. 
Crypto may play a role in making banks more robust. Diversity alone is an excellent reason.
Survival is kinda important for any business.

Can't say about US Law, but under Australian Tax law it is a capital gains event and liable for capital gains tax. The value of the goods at market value is used to calculate the capital gains. Likewise you should also be able to claim a capital loss (as an offset to a capital gain) under reverse conditions. I'd guess US tax law would be similar. 
If you're talking small money then they are not likely to bother with doing the work to check, but a $98,000 capital gain, I'm sure they would be interested in, so you're best to play it straight and pay the tax.

Oh great! More lawyers &amp; politicians involved, that is sure to make things better!....it's always worked in the past..
Seriously tho, I'm not convinced Bitcoin is bad for government or even banks. (But I'm certain it's fantastic for lawyers!).
IF I was an enemy of the USA, I would want the USA to continue to regulate itself down the drain. Manufacturing left USA for this reason, perhaps the finance 'industry' is next.
It's very early days, and assuming there are at least some very bright people in banks &amp; government, they might get creative, earn those massive salaries &amp; benefits and figure out how they can benefit from Bitcoin by adding something to it! 
Or are government &amp; banks incapable of doing this ?  
For starters, compared with cash, Bitcoin is already fantastic for Government. Doing shady transactions with Bitcoin is much, much more difficult than with cash and the block chain can be analysed for eternity, with who knows what amazing future technology. Given the massive size of the grey cash economy, this alone is reason for governments to actively support Bitcoin without putting any unhelpful regulations in the way. The simplest,cheapest, smartest thing the US government could do is copy what Canada did. Much easier for any government department to access the blockchain than a Swiss bank! 
A parallel currency, that is inflation resistant, such as Bitcoin, would add significant resilience to our financial system. At a time when the global FIAT banking bubble is about to burst on a historic record setting scale, one would think this is an urgent imperative to actively support the best proven option currently available - Bitcoin!
It would be irresponsible of Governments &amp; bankers to hamper an innovation that could most likely mitigate the disaster that is very clearly approaching. There will be no saying "we didn't see it coming". 
If the US places regulations on Bitcoin, it could inadvertently (incompetently?) steer Bitcoin away from delivering the very benefits our financial system desperately needs. 
Hmm, perhaps I should buy one share in each major bank, so after they crash, I can go to the shareholders meetings and ask why they didn't adopt Bitcoin and diversify their risk ?? Why did they put all their eggs in one financial system ? Why did banks try to crush an innovation that could have protected themselves from collapse ?? Aren't bank managers compelled by law to ensure their company is prosperous ? 
Bitcoin has something fantastic that Banks &amp; Government DON'T. Why lobby ? If you have to lobby, it immediately implies there is either conflict, or they are ignorant. 
How about calling on the government to sponsor a tiger team of the best minds from gov &amp; industry to work with the Bitcoin community to make the most out of Bitcoin for everybody ?

"Best Case" bitcoin goes astronomical and you make a ton of money. You get deluded that making money is always this easy, make silly choices with your profits and lose it all. There again you may already be naturally over-cautious &amp; this success gives you the courage to be a stellar entrepreneur.

In general, I OK with paying taxes. It means I'm making money :) I'd rather just pay what's due and not have to worry about being had up for doing something dodgy.
However, the tax system needs a major overhaul, it's completely unfair on the middle class. Far too generous towards the lazy and those that insist on making endless stupid choices. Especially, the tax system is far too supportive of the super rich. It's way too complicated and there is very little respect at all by politicians and most government workers towards those that actually pay the taxes that pay government salaries. 
It's not working anywhere near as well as it should be, or even used to, so it's time to do something different.

The US &amp; other western countries has lost most of it's manufacturing not to higher wage costs, but to over-regulation.     The advances in Automation means there is relatively little labour required to make things, but companies in the west have to employ large numbers of expensive people to ensure compliance with endless government regulations which is really what makes it unattractive to make anything in a western country. We can see this clearly with the compliance cost on Bitcoin exchanges in the USA.

A price of 0.0395 BTC (rather than $3.95) then you've lost most people after the second decimal. If you have to think about it for more than half a moment (or 0.5 of a moment for those that love decimals so much), then it's too complicated for common everyday use.
Sure it's not that hard to figure out, and if everyone was forced to learn it, then it would soon be considered easy by 90% of the population that are semiconscious dolts (on a good day). 
I don't see governments racing to force Bitcoins on the population, so if you want it widely accepted, resistance needs to be reduced, regardless whether the resistance is logical or not, it still slows things down. 
Besides why do it the hard way ? It's a lot easier to give Bitcoin some easy units to work with than spend years trying educate 7 billion people how to use their brain in an unnatural way. After all it's pretty hard to think of anything in common everyday spoken use that employs large fractions. 
NerdfighterSean's suggestion is pretty good. People are fairly used to 1k 1meg, 1 gig abbreviations, 100gig would buy a pretty decent car, 1 Terra would buy a nice house :)

don't stress, they are worth exactly 5BTC today tomorrow and next year. 
As to their 'value' in $ well that depends on what a $ is worth.....and that depends on whether you chose the red pill or the blue pill....
Which $ are you even talking about ?

Great post! Both sides have some merit. The biggest threat to banks is not Bitcoin, it's their own greed. 
Bitcoin could be great for governments, they are not exactly doing well with fiat at the moment. 
I don't see any reason to destroy banks. Keep them honest by all means! Sure banks may have to change their game, but  banks have to change all the time to keep competitive anyway.

The Chinese government must believe their banking system is VERY fragile indeed if it thinks Bitcoin is a risk to it at this stage.
As far as money the laundering excuse, that's just laughable.

Perhaps the Senate needs to launch an inquiry to make sure NSA computers are not being misused for Bitcoin mining :-) But who could be trusted to do it properly ?

Good post. Free speech is critical, but it would be nice if more people on here realized that there are many very good people in government and maybe even some in banks.

good question. Belief ? Faith ? 
If Gold has some intrinsic use to match it's value, then most of it would currently be used for something instead of sitting in the dark occupying extremely expensive real estate.

Australia seems very prude and Victorian to many who grew up here as well. Murdoch dominated media and religious nuts in parliament have a lot to do with it.
Sydney Morning Herald is just another mainstream propaganda rag that's not worth reading.  Note they didn't allow comments on this article.

The price was so stable it was getting boring. Thanks for the entertainment!
Wonder if 
1. the shady elements involved in Bitcoin are cashing out and going elsewhere.
2. someone just hoping to crash the price to buy back in 
again cheaper. Risky move - unless they wanted to buy in with a bigger quantity.
3. Trading volumes are much lower when the price is stable. Maybe Mt Gox shook things up a bit. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 13:16:34
Bitcoin has far more protection against shady business built in than cash does. Bitcoin shady business is insignificant compared with cash. But that doesn't mean using or supporting cash is supporting illegitimate things.
@_date: 2013-05-30 02:00:03
Very true. It's just a lot easier to prosecute individuals in a small company. Government employees always find the least risk, lowest amount of work (as do most of us!).
The government for all it's bluster is not powerful or courageous enough to seriously go after large corporations whether they have evidence or not, at least until the public outcry is so big they can't ignore it.
Large companies have immense power to threaten or even frame politicians &amp; government employees and plenty of lawyers to defend them if that doesn't work. 
But from the sound of it, Liberty were not even attempting to be clean and must have known they were mostly supporting a bunch of lowlifes.

I agree. People I talk to are far more aware/receptive also. Even my 80 year old mum who gave me grief over it 8 months ago now asked me to buy her one.

Apparently BitPay takes care of most of this for you.
I'd love to accept Bitcoin in my business, even if it is just experimental to start with, but most of my clients are government or large corporate...so I'll be waiting a while.

My estimate is there are far more foreign economists saying the US$ will fail - at least as the worlds reserve currency &amp; that will drag many currencies down with it.

Great move Mt Gox! I verified as soon as I joined, best way to avoid trouble. Best way for Mt Gox to stay in business also.
The US government is not being unreasonable so far. There have been no drone strikes on Mt Gox at all!  
Seriously, Bitcoin is supposed to be helping make the world better for everyone, if Bitcoin triggered the US government to go clean up people that support credit card hackers then perhaps in a way it's a small victory for Bitcoin. If they next go hard after some big dodgy banks then they can really be proud of themselves.

With the amount of press bitcoin has received the law had to be seen to be doing something. 
It's a pity the US regulators aren't as as equally hard lined on big banks that play foul, but then big media isn't going to make a big noise about their biggest customers shortcomings are they?

Well done Tom! Excellent Job! Words were great, will look forward to seeing what actually transpires. 
Still nice to have a little faith in the USA political system restored  (even though I'm not American).
Hopefully not too late for the USA to catch up with China on the Bitcoin front.

I got into Bitcoin after Money Morning mentioned it in their free newsletter in Jan - THANKS GUYS :) :)
The article is fair, except they completely missed that BitPay takes care of the volatility thus negating their entire position and undermined their credibility to anyone that knows anything about Bitcoin.

If we move straight to satoshis it could easily create the perception there will then be no further room to move in the future.
Logic is all well and good but it's often trumped by how the masses perceive something.

An explosive growth of Bitcoin isn't good for Bitcoin or state currency, they have just restrained, not killed. Bitcoin would self destruct if allowed to run without restraint "at this stage".

You have good evidence. Go to the police. Theft is theft. It doesn't make any difference whether it's Bitcoins stolen or some other legal property. Insist that they look into it thoroughly. 
There again, the British police are too busy guarding Julian Assaunge because the Swedish police are too lazy to go question him in England. But go and nicely ask them anyway and keep on them to make sure they do their job.

If I had been silly/brave enough to do this, I would not be posting on reddit and asking for the obvious taunting.
As much as this smells like BS, I once took a big 2nd mortgage to buy shares on the stock market...and made a killing :)  But I did my homework properly and it wasn't in a fledgeling virtual currency where every article, even the bulls are warning it's highly speculative. 
Who knows, a year from now, you may also have your mortgage paid off with change for a boat and more. Either that or divorced with a ton of debt. Good luck, enjoy the ride.

Bitcoin already offers far superior traceability to governments than cash or gold or diamonds. 
Overall, Bitcoin is a step forward vs cash, for government, we should remind governments not to be too greedy as all it will do is raise more people against them.
There are some very bright minds in the community and most don't support criminal activity. 
Given the amazing success of Bitcoin already achieved, it's clearly best to leave this issue for the community to solve &amp; the community has plenty of incentive to do so. 
Since the government were actually able to catch DPR and shut Silk Road it's not as if Bitcoin is some silver bullet they need to fear. 
There is so much BS on Reddit about how bad Bitcoin is for government it's nauseous! Bitcoin has many many benefits for governments - all governments. Sure, there are some voices in government speaking from fear &amp; ignorance, but many also see the benefits. 
Our message to government should be, Be honest &amp; fair! You're welcome to help! Give us time to solve it! 
Regulations should be last resort, criminals find ways around them &amp; they are expensive to maintain.

Good analogy! "
The store is 500,000 mm away from my house." You would say, "The store is 500 m away from my house." "
When I read this I thought - BTC vs mBTC is no harder to understand than loads of other measurements...that we grew up with...so mostly it's a non issue. But 0.000123 is still unnatural &amp; difficult and we still need a name that rolls easily. 
There again, extending your point, millimeter being a mouthful hasn't stopped it's usage (but no-one had a choice and it is easier than saying 1/25th of an inch.
