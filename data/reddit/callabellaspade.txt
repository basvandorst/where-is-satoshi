It's not like the issue of any economy has ever been the physical currency bursting into flame or something. Find any defunct currency and it still physically operates as always.

Everything is always an outside conspiracy. 
What sort of world view did you grow up with where you think everyone secretly agrees with you and people that say they don't are just trying to trick you? 
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:36:37
I think someone lied to you if they told you you can buy bitcoin in almost any city on earth, unless you oddly mean "online" in which case buying altcoins are no harder. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:15:26
It is even more naive to think you have all the answers and people all secretly agree with you and only pretend to disagree to try to mislead you. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:26:00
It used to be funnier when people posted "bitcoin is dead" then the price went up, now people post it's dead and the price drops and makes them seem right. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:42:16
Is the problem that 175,000 transactions per day is hilariously tiny and indicates an active user base measured in tens of hundreds at most? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:47:52
But you know for sure that 400 and 300 and 200 and 100 aren't the same thing? 
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:54:21
Just another word for convincing yourself bitcoin is "too big to fail".
@_date: 2016-01-26 18:32:54
Will it include tonal numbers y/n?
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:02:46
People will cope because people are generally rarely using bitcoin for actual meaningful transactions. So there would be no real problems even if it was delayed hours or days or weeks. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:14:12
Bitcoin has less users than the number of people that bought the virtual boy. More people bought "ant man" on dvd this week than have ever bought bitcoin ever. Network effect is a joke for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 19:18:43
The whole premise of bitcoin was having a blockchain. If transactions can be secure on a p2p network without the blockchain then we can just throw that hunk of junk in the ocean and not use it.  The answer on how to make a zero confirmation transaction more secure is to wait till it's got a confirmation. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:10:25
Yeah, sure, but the whole "look at this dumb dumb saying bitcoin died!" only seems super convincing when the price goes up later and makes them look silly. When someone says bitcoin is dying then the price goes down and doesn't recover they just look right.
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:28:20
Bitcoin was originally p2p and miners were nodes. Now nodes are just some weird legacy thing that cost money to run and have poorly defined function for poorly defined reward. You can just send transactions to miners directly, but nodes get to be a weird needless middleman in on it that provide no tangible benefit. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:17:14
Bitcoin doesn't have full blocks though? They average like 75% full. You are complaining about just regular old slowness and unreliability. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:49:37
Does he understand it or does he just tell people what they wanted to hear? 
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:32:37
That .7 btc is now worth 265 so it's not like you can get your $400 back. 
So you can either salvage what you got left or get more and more frantically determined that bitcoin will eventually give you your money back and all you need is more faith. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:39:55
Who told you that it'd be returned after 48 hours? How you think it works is a different system than how it actually works. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:15:06
Rolling back sounds absurdly bad though? What an unthinkable thing to do to a supposedly "immutable ledger".   
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:29:50
Satoshi wanted version .3 to be version 1.3 but apparently the other devs didn't like that and reverted his change. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:56:50
Wait, so deflation is bad? 
@_date: 2016-01-25 18:00:33
Okay, but if you have their bank account information why wouldn't you just use that? 
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:45:55
Why are you sure it will go up? I mean, it might go up, but lots of people bought at times they were SURE it'd go up and are still waiting. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:32:28
You couldn't really buy "all the bitcoin in the world" since a bunch of weirdos would hold on no matter what and not sell at any price or not sell at anything but absurd prices. 
But for all the bitcoin in the world that is currently on the market you wouldn't need to be anywhere near the richest person in the world to buy it all. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:03:14
So why is your theory that all these people secretly all know the real answer is the one you think but are just telling lies that they believe other things to try to destroy the faith of the bitcoin community? (who all agree with you also)?
@_date: 2016-01-22 16:49:57
Like they do a weird needless function of "passing transactions" but that isn't really of any benefit. To have some weird intermediary on a network where you are just as able to connect to the miners as the intermediary nodes are.  
@_date: 2016-01-22 14:50:24
That is what they did on dogecoin and several other altcoins. It's inevitable to happen on bitcoin as well. As soon as subsidy drops enough to show fees are never going to rise enough to support the millions of dollars a day apparently needed to handle a few thousand transactions. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:47:26
Prices of all sorts of cryptocurrencies declined for all sorts of reasons. Bitcoin has gone down quite a lot as well since dogecoin changed over. At most we know infinite printing has not killed dogecoin and the network still functions and goes both up and down in price.
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:52:57
Are you quoting yourself?
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:47:11
Rolling it back and throwing away blocks absolutely loses all the transactions in those blocks. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:48:44
Happens, and is super easy to scam people with. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:12:55
Looks like bitcoin needs the government to come bail it out once again!
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:58:40
Bitcoin is down 6% since two days ago. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 13:18:03
Also applies to a bunch of other cryptocurrencies. Why should people use bitcoin over them? If the answer is because it's first that is absurdly weak and if the answer is that it's popular you have to realize calling something with less than a million users too popular to fail is pretty silly. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:14:30
It absolutely is a concern, it's a way that bitcoin is objectively worse than what people are using now. When visa asks you to use 0gb of your hard disk asking 1gb seems like a lot. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:54:25
And this is the trick you use to preserve a worldview where not only do you think you are right but you believe that you are so right that everyone agrees with you and people that don't are just deceivers set up to trick and test you. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 13:45:38
There is virtually no block size that could handle even a few hundred thousand users paying on chain per website they load. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 14:44:21
No, bitcoin is unhackable, except you have to not count the times it was hacked because those don't count okay?
@_date: 2016-01-14 20:33:10
The s&amp;p 500 is up 1% in the last two days while bitcoin is down 6%, only in bitcoin land is that bitcoin beating stocks. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:45:15
Remember what happened when mtgox imploded: The price went down 66% and never really recovered even years later. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:57:47
It doesn't work like that because that is absurdly bad. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 14:20:34
This seems like a 'when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail". Don't ram stuff that doesn't belong into trying to use things for other stuff just because it has been used in bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:49:59
My opinion is that it's not guaranteed to. It may or it may not and it's not just a matter of having faith or being strong or something. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 19:43:13
It's weird how much the bitcoin community can hype up bitcoin people quitting bitcoin to go work for the competition as being good news for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:06:41
Now do the math and figure out how many people can make 20x transactions a week and still have bitcoin function.  
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:43:49
How exactly are they making money again? 
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:14:39
Because it's pretty easy to make any random graphs look similar if you are willing to manipulate both the x and the y axis. 
plus they don't even look particularly similar. Even with you messing with the time scale and the size to make them look more similar. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:24:19
Maybe it's bad for bitcoin that it dies so much? It used to be a funny thing where someone said it died then a week later the price was up, but now people said it was dead at 900 and 800 and 700 and 600 and 500 and after they said it it didn't get the bump back up to prove them wrong. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:49:39
"Full nodes" don't control the protocol and weren't even part of the protocol in the original ideas of satoshi. Bitcoin was originally p2p + people connecting using lite clients to nodes, not this weird server/client/relay system. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:23:07
What good is money that can't buy coffee? Every other type of money can buy coffee. Who is going to use money that is worse than regular money?

same thing
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:46:11
Bitcoin does better and is bigger in the countries with the strongest and healthiest economies and weakest and least used in the countries with the weakest economies so seems weird to assume if economies got weaker bitcoin would get stronger.

Now post a graph of all the other millions of products that didn't succeed. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:46:47
It doesn't always correct itself, it came down from 1100 through 900 to 800 to 700 to 600 to 500 and as of yet has not returned to any of those prices. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 15:06:55
That didn't really happen for bitcoin on the first halfing, it didn't happen for litecoin on it's recent halfing. It hasn't happened to any of the bajillion other altcoins. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:38:47
Please note: when people are asking about bitcoin they are mostly asking about it as a concept and a product, not about technical details or a walkthrough on how to send it. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:45:15
I can buy coffee just fine with the types of money swift uses. If swift ever claimed to be a currency in and of itself that would be hella dumb and exactly why they never do that and just claim to move dollars and stuff. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 14:40:45
Heh, don't those losers know that it's been a couple years since bitcoin let you give yourself 184 billion bitcoin and there could never be another bug because uh... that was the last one satoshi put in. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:45:08
I love that bitcoin users can lose 400 dollars and then still talk about the "next time". 
@_date: 2016-01-15 13:51:06
Bitcoin never came back from the price drop after mtgox though, it doesn't "always come back".

Isn't the whole reason that is supposed to make us rich that it's gonna take some people by surprise? Counting down like that ruins it all. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:28:10
After all this time going on and on about how countries having economic problems would make bitcoin users rich it turned out to be a lie!? how could that be!
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:46:31
You aren't allowed to think or talk about that here. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 20:40:07
A large portion of bitcoin was handed out to people who played videogames and had nice graphics card. It's not a meritocracy, it's a system that handed out money for grown men who played with children's toys. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:39:01
Major developer for bitcoin quit and called bitcoin a failed experiment. This got reported in major news outlets. 
But don't worry people said bitcoin was dead when it was 900 then 800 then 700 then 600 then 500 dollars as well and look how uh... silly.. they... uh... look? 
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:06:47
That whole death count thing only seems funny when the price recovers. If someone says bitcoin is dead at 15 cents then a year later it's 150 dollars that is a good retort.
Now the price actually does drop and it's less funny, if someone was claiming bitcoin was dead after mtgox and you show them the price went down 2/3rds with no sign of recovering they will just go "yeah, it's dead, like I said" 
@_date: 2016-01-22 14:48:46
Devs changed the supposedly immutable blockchain by hand, because that is a thing they have always been able to do, rendering the cryptography element of bitcoin relatively moot.

"Most users in the study believed Bitcoin has good security and privacy controls despite evidence saying otherwise."

They didn't drop to zero. Bitcoin is down 4% today and dogecoin is up 11%. I'm not sure it was good for the price overall but it didn't kill the currencies either.

Sorry the ever changing list of which bitcoin wallets might lose all your money currently rests on blockchain.info being one that is unreliable, please use something else until it turns out that wallet was also unreliable all along. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:11:18
Seems like you are trying to use a blockchain for something that has absolutely no possible reason why a blockchain should or could be involved. Blockchains aren't just magic that makes everything better.
