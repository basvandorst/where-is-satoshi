Instant and free transactions.
@_date: 2019-03-16 08:15:07
I am pro Bitcoin but I also don't think Nano is a shitcoin.
Do you even know how it works bro?
Please read before talking shit about just anything!
@_date: 2019-03-16 06:49:34
Why did you list NANO? 
is it a shitcoin ?
@_date: 2019-03-16 08:22:04
*But yes, they are all shit coins*
@_date: 2019-03-07 17:53:24
Wtf FBI ?
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:02:52
Dude! How do u get over that mistake?
I would have hard time forgetting it.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:44:28
Serious question, not sarcasm. How did you contribute to the Bitcoin as a whole?
Also if someone sells the Bitcoin, does it help the community?
Am sorry for being a noob as I don't have much knowledge about the way Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:49:33
Dude , I am not trolling him at all.
Just asking for the way he gets over thinking about it.
I asked because I regret something like that too.
That is it.
Sorry if you or him took it the wrong way.
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:24:33
Is that even a thing ?
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:27:20
Thanks for the info. But I just checked the ledger website and it has very few alt coins. So how would I store them ?
@_date: 2017-08-29 02:57:32
Seems like you did a good job then :)
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:41:04
You are absolutely right bro. Need to move on and look for further opportunities. Thank you 
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:50:38
Wow. I never thought it like that way.
That makes total sense.
Am sorry for being so ignorant about that. Thanks to all of you early guys who did all the transactions to help in taking Bitcoin to where it is today.
Respect :)
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:12:37
What if I loose my ledger nano S?
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:25:05
I use a Nokia 1108!
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:27:03
That BitSmile still lasts 
@_date: 2019-02-15 15:29:06
So 20000 dollars (Dec 17) for reddit gold.
U rich thing ;)
@_date: 2019-02-15 12:38:09
Shut up you piece of shit banker
@_date: 2019-02-14 10:59:16
You got the patience of gold :)
@_date: 2019-02-06 14:56:52
What the shit 
@_date: 2019-01-04 08:25:02
I couldn't find any at the centre on my last visit :(
But then I only had Nano to pay 
@_date: 2019-01-23 03:20:38
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:28:05
Can you tell me where exactly you found this ?
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:04:46
Lmfao !!
@_date: 2019-01-04 08:40:30
Dude why so salty ?
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:35:33
Also is there a fees when you tip someone ?
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:40:06
That's unfair. So he pays the fees to exchange to convert to btc and then again on conversion back to fiat. Takes the risk of crypto. And he has to pay taxes still if he doesn't convert ? What kind of dystopian world we are living in !
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:33:30
Not if he doesn't cash out 
@_date: 2019-01-09 08:45:46
Payfair already does that. No ?
@_date: 2019-01-04 08:09:51
Bullish on shares of rat poison companies ?
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:46:52
@_date: 2019-01-04 09:21:50
Ah alright. Maybe OP didn't see that ?
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:14:01
Lol. Really had to make that sexual. Didn't u ?
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:17:46
She looks happy :)
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:39:39
I see. It's just that I automatically assume anyone talking about Bitcoin is a guy lol.
no logic behind that thinking though!
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:41:06
Cant you just "loose" your private keys ?
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:41:00
So you paid her in Bitcoin eventually?
How much , just curious :P
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:41:18
Who is this guy?
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:06:56
I was hoping it was sarcasm :D
then would have been a never ending loop of sarcasm!
Anyway enjoy the day happy stranger :)
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:48:03
Get the Ledger Nano!
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:27:53
More reasons to not read the shitty news papers
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:01:33
Haha. Was that sarcasm though ?
@_date: 2017-09-02 20:16:44
Seems like NEM had some huge returns !
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:51:08

@_date: 2017-07-13 08:00:13
This guy knows the future !
@_date: 2018-12-26 15:15:59
Oops . My bad. Sorry didn't know that. Thanks for info :)
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:22:41

@_date: 2018-12-26 07:39:28

@_date: 2018-12-15 04:45:26

@_date: 2018-12-26 11:36:41
Wtf India ?
@_date: 2018-12-21 08:04:24
Finally a guiness record I can break 
@_date: 2018-12-21 08:03:48
@_date: 2018-12-27 08:54:29
So can indians buy crypto again from normal exchanges?
@_date: 2018-12-26 11:45:24
That sucks big time. Maybe Indian government comes to its senses and atleast not copy China this time.
Else big mistake dude!
