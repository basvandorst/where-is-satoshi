Okay, but how does that relate to its monetary value? 
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:24:41
This is ridiculous! I have been trying for 4 or 5 hours now and haven't found a damn thing!
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:58:39
See I have the same problem.. I found them using Sr, and my dumbass didn't think anything of it being $10/btc and now I'm kicking myself as I watch it rise. :(

That's awesome!! haha I always take my change to a coinstar and absolutely hate the fact that I can't just have those sent to my bitcoin address. It would be such an easy way to slowly grow your wallet.

I should go copyright my idea right now!!
@_date: 2013-03-27 22:26:54
Very informative and exactly what I was look for, thank you! 
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:13:57
Yeah its a shitty situation for sure. :( and how'd you get them at $65 a coin? I know it drops during the weekends but still lol 
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:30:29
Yeah, gox is such a pain in the ass I don't even bother with it. Thanks though!

How do you know we aren't the same person? 
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:27:21
At the risk of sounding like the usual ill-informed idiot, how/why are these undervalued at $100 and what would cause them to go up to the $1,000+ values that I've read about? 
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:20:33
Well lucky you! I get paid Friday and will definitely be watching that live feed lol in your opinion, which is the best way to buy? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:36:48
This shit is gonna be the end of me!
@_date: 2013-02-11 15:19:55
Thanks, man! Totally wasn't expecting that, but thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:29:20
That's an awfully courteous question, DR_McBUTTFUCK
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:04:51
I'm surprised you aren't suing me already!
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:00:28
Thanks so much for the article, but quick question, I kind of understand why everyone preaches 'don't invest more than you can lose' because I played with the stock market a few years back, but why does everyone on here say it almost religiously? Is this more of a risk than buying any stock, or is it just because its something brand new and we don't know what's going to happen with it? 
@_date: 2013-02-10 19:23:40
I would love to know if you are still doing this!! Free bitcoins would be nice as well.. (:
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:20:07
Holy shit, thank you so much! That is awesome, man!
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:44:44
Email sent! Let's see if we can turn this into a real thing!
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:34:09
Gimme that email address and I'll email them as well! Great minds think alike! 
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:14:53
Ugh decisions, decisions! Thank you again for your help, Matt! 
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:30:28
Thank you very much for the thoughtful response! I'd love for this to be the case.
Are the early adopters you're talking about the ones who adopted in 2009-2011 or those who are still adopting it now? 
Also, would it be good to spend a little of the interest on 'stuff' just to make sure it stays steady, or would such a little bit spent go unnoticed?
