6 to 12 months: 20k easy, 12 to 24 months after: 50k, 24 to 48 months after: 75k to 100k. That's my outlook.

Totally agree. Wells Fargo is worst then the mafia.

I personally, really like your plan. Maybe buyback in smaller amounts once you sell a huge chunk. It'll only keep going up YOY.
In fact, I'm striving to work a plan similar to yours. DCA is my goal and once I feel it hits a peak I will sell a portion, wait for the bigger drops, put a little back in, and keep some for myself to pay bills that run this crypto machine.
But, I won't keep operating with the same small amounts. I will try to operate in percentages so overall it's like a tiny snowball that gets bigger and bigger. Plus, I have some philosophical belief in crypto versus fiat.

What happens to Granny's bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-07-16 00:10:15
Why's that? Is that the pattern
@_date: 2018-07-29 15:08:18
Yes, I wish that wasn't the case. There should be a way to recover but it does make it that much more scarce and secure. But, irresponsible people just lose it.

Agree!
