Imagine your aging father, or your sister, or the average person you work or go to school with, reading through this thread.  Seriously.  Widespread adoption of crypto wallets is not going to keep pace with the growth of BTC and crypto in general.
Bitcoin is wholly dependent on the big exchanges, especially the BIG exchange, not getting hacked.  So I sure hope they have every possible hole plugged.  Because who tf wants to mess around with Segwit wallets etc.?  I’d speculate it’s only a very small percentage of users.

I can't figure out who the villains are.  I agree with OP that there definitely is a schadenfreude-ey, t_d-ish vibe on the BTC sub, but I also do think that there are people who very passionately and sincerely believe that bigger block size is the best way to scale Bitcoin.  I'm pretty well screwed if BCH wins out but fortunately I haven't invested heavily in crypto so I'll be fine, if disappointed.  But yes, agree with you that the whole business of it could collapse with all of this factionalism happening.

The energy consumed by the Bitcoin network is pretty astounding, I'm concerned about it too.  Hopefully at least some it is being supplied by renewables.

@_date: 2017-08-09 18:53:07
That it happens with penny stocks is precisely my point.  "Liquid and trusted markets" - not sure what you mean exactly, and how such markets relate to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:47:06
"accepted by all of the same entities" is a barely, if at all, relevant consideration in the current cryptocurrency environment.  It's all about buying coins to inflate your fiat.  And as such the number of "bitcoins" that could be put into circulation is basically unlimited, at least up to the point where they all become worthless.
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:06:00

Concerning 3)  
Yes, a very, very, VERY free market.  I.e. there's nothing at all preventing whales from colluding and manipulating prices using techniques that are illegal to use in the stock market (spoofing comes to mind).  So again, why should these whales hold onto bitcoin if the huge returns they've been getting on it peter out, and they see an opportunity to pump CryptoCashCoin23 and make a killing?  If the only reason to buy into bitcoin is because of the returns, then there's no reason why it can't crash to zero next week.  And such volatility works against it ever gaining widespread use.  Catch-22.
I just wonder sometimes if we're all being taken for a ride.  I mean, good for the whales if we are - never anything wrong with parting fools from their money, it's a time-honored practice.
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:37:44
This is the TL;DR version of why Bitcoin will never be widely adopted.  Too much of it is permanently lost, nobody knows who the "whales" are and how much BTC they hold, people are buying it only to HODL it with the hope of a future windfall...The more I think of Bitcoin in real-world terms, the more I think...Pyramid.  I'll hodl onto what I have, and who knows maybe I'm wrong, but imo BTC is the Alpha, and can never become the beta , let alone the production , cryptocurrency, again because too much is lost or held by anonymous whales.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:38:52

Why didn't every person aware of Microsoft's existence in 1985 buy Microsoft stock in 1985.  Because nobody really knew where it would go.
The people who invested early in BTC (Edit: and held onto it) were just very very lucky, mostly.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:38:09
I think that Bitcoin enthusiasts need to sell bitcoin more on the benefits you've elucidated, because these benefits have already been fully realized.  (Hence the need to be very conservative in making changes to it.  It's pretty swell as it is.)
I agree that bitcoin's future as a medium for purchasing goods and services is not very likely.  I own bitcoin (just a little) and tbh I have no desire to use it to buy coffee at Starbucks.  I just want to HODL it and watch its value in relationship to USD go up, up, up.  Maybe I'd feel differently about it if I converted all of my USD savings to btc but I'm not ready to do that just yet.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:14:25
Good luck.  I've gotten burned every time I've attempted that.

All of the points you mention are valid, and that's why it would be foolish to invest more in bitcoin than you can afford to lose.

Personally I'm not so sure that cryptocurrency, in terms of future widespread adoption, is a non-zero-sum game.  Especially when it comes to BTC and BCH.

So in 5 days there (might) be a massive sell-off of bch (and resulting price crash)?  Just trying to understand how the price is at where it is right now 
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:16:40
Deflation is right.  You would have a fixed money supply, but the usual ever-increasing gains in efficiency.  So that jug of milk that costs 2 mBTC today would cost 1.9 mBTC next year, and so on.  Instead of getting a cost of living increase raise, you'd get a cost of living decrease lowering.  I have no idea how lending would work.  I guess you'd just borrow and only have to pay back the principal or maybe even less, because the ever-increasing purchasing value of bitcoin would, in effect, serve as interest paid.  
I'm only scratching the surface, and just barely.  It would be so wildly different from how monetary systems work today that it would take at least a generation to adjust to the new paradigm.  I like BTC and all, but a widescale adoption of it, if it ever happens, would be incredibly disruptive to a very, VERY entrenched monetary status quo, and beyond that, to the very essence of how modern capitalist society is structured.  I'm skeptical that it will happen in my lifetime (I'm a few years past the typical midway point).  Perhaps the sea of idealistic 20-somethings that populate this sub will live the bitcoin dream in their lifetime.  Who knows.  Crazy world and keeps getting crazier.
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:24:30
Well from what I understand, if BTC was a regulated security, then whoever is doing this could totally get busted.  But crypto is still the wild west of investing.  
How soon until these same party or parties decide to push it the other way and profit from a manipulated decline? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:48:39

I'm very much a Bitcoin n00b, but a real-world semi-old, and I have to say that I have a very difficult time seeing Bitcoin supplanting fiat currency for the vast majority of people in society anytime soon.  It's simply too complicated to buy/hold/sell.  
But I like the idea that it could become more like Linux, in that it would power the world's financial transactions without being something that your average Joe is aware of.  Oh and yes it be awesome if we all got rich off it too ��

Cryptocurrency's huge 2017 increases have been a black swan across the board.  Shorting on NVIDIA and AMD probably seemed pretty reasonable at the time.  Who knew?  The companies themselves certainly didn't see it coming.
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:54:25
ha i don't care about the downvotes or upvotes.  I was just hoping for some intelligent answers (so far: Results are mixed!)  
Anyway, I could create a personal fork of bitcoin tomorrow and obviously it would go nowhere.  But what i see happening is a proliferation of cryptocurrencies, many of them fairly established, many others just barely, and very niche.  But take the recent controversial hard-fork.  If you're a crypto-whale (or a pod of crypto-whales) just trading to make money, then you couldn't care less about block size or segwits or any of that.  And it seems to me that, if said whales decide that pumping the price of the, ahem, 'cash' coin, presents an opportunity (i.e. hey guys if the original went this high, then lets dump the original and get behind this one, get its price up into the thousands, and profit hugely), what's to stop them?
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:05:00
I see what you mean now - 1) it makes no sense to lend without getting at least SOME interest, otherwise it'd be better to just keep your money, and 2) borrowing a deflationary currency, when the deflation rate is high, is punishing because the money you'd be paying back to the lender would be increasing in purchase power at such a high rate.  So you borrow 1 bitcoin today, and the same bitcoin buys twice as many goods and services tomorrow, but instead of getting the benefit of that, you'd be paying back the one bitcoin back to the lender, plus interest.  Yes - that'd be bad.
No i don't know of anyone who has thought of this problem. I'm very new to thinking about deflationary vs. inflationary currency myself.  I've only thought about it enough to realize how huge the difference between the two is, and thus how difficulty it would be to adopt a version of the former when the latter has been in play for so long.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:05:16
If bitcoin and its forked-off variants only ever have utility as stores of value (as is currently the case) then indeed all the splitting into equally viable value-storage coins does defeat the spirit of the 21million cap.  
I think that all the forking and factionalism and whale-manipulation around bitcoin is going to be its demise, and if bitcoin goes, so goes cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:16:37
But nobody knows how much BTC is lost (and how much gets added to this quantity with each passing year) and therefore nobody can say what the "supply of coins to sell" actually is.  Thus impossible to value accurately.  
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:07:13
I hope you're right but the present-day US Government exists to protect itself and the wealthy elite.  If bitcoin is a threat to that, then bitcoin loses, they will make sure of it.

Me being a Bitcoin n00b, I spent an hour or so last night trying to get an understanding of how market-spoofing works.  Once I kinda got a handle on that, I re-read the article and was like 'oh shit!  the reason for the recent price rise is because bitfinex is shady and some whale traders on that platform are manipulating the price using methods that are illegal on securities exchanges!'.  
But you all are like meh, move along, nothing to see here

@_date: 2017-08-28 16:25:39
What would really help increase adoption is if bitcoin - the idea - wasn't being continuously diluted by it getting forked off into competing versions all claiming to be the real deal.  The recent big-block fork has made me very skeptical that bitcoin (again, the idea) will ever realize its potential.  And yes I think the people behind the big-block chain bear responsibility if it all comes to nothing, all because they're so DAMN SURE that every transaction has to be on-chain, that this was satoshi's holy vision related to his 12 apostles before ascending to heaven.

It's a valid concern that the high price of a single coin could scare off people who might otherwise convert their fiat to BTC.  'You mean to tell me that just one of these things equals thousands of my country's currency?  How could that be??"
It's too much of a psychological shift to think of prices in terms of thousandths or ten-thousandths of this new currency when all your life the price of that item was a dollar.  Or a peso.  "Yes sir your total today for that snickers bar comes to three tenthousandths BTC."  Too weird imo.  
Perhaps mbtc is how it should be displayed by default.  Or perhaps change it so that each existing bitcoin is split into 10,000, with each ten-thousandth piece becoming the new bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:45:21
Absolutely not.  And that's why I just laugh to myself when Bitcoin enthusiasts express a belief that bitcoin is somehow government-proof.  Incredible naivety.  They could shut down bitcoin tomorrow if they want to.  And they will the moment they perceive it as a threat to Trump Inc's (i.e. the US government's) power.  Looks like that moment has arrived.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:11:47

@_date: 2017-08-09 17:13:07
This only works though if gold is agreed upon as the exchange token, not just the value-storage means, and the former is still the missing piece with Bitcoin.

How about Bronze the year after that?  Sounds good!

I see the Venture Investors group being a major long-term price suppressing influence on bitcoin at best, and its undoing at worst.
If the only point of investing in crypto is getting the maximum return on your investment, as is the case for this group, then there's no reason to put your money in bitcoin if kittycatcoin is expected to "outperform" it, to use a common stock-trading term, over the anticipated duration of the investment.  The end game of this approach to cryptocurrency investment is an unlimited quantity of competing bitcoins (generically speaking), with each having little or no real-world utility, with the whole lot of them collectively being little more than a massively disruptive, unregulated shitpile of individual pyramid schemes.  And if this becomes the case, govt will step in and shut down the whole party.  And dear god don't kid yourself about crypto being government-proof.

I'm more comfortable keeping my bitcoin on an exchange than in a wallet or on a printed private key.  
If exchanges can't figure out how to keep from being hacked, then bitcoin doesn't have a future, as managing it via wallets or Trezors or whatever else is, imo, far beyond the effort that your average joe is willing (or even intellectually capable) of putting into owning it.  
And if governments, esp western ones, decide that bitcoin is too dangerous, then the party is over anyway.  It's value as both as a purchasing utility and as a store of value will go to zero.

To summarily dismiss it all as bias, FUD, sour grapes, or whatever else, is to ignore the fact that very intelligent and experienced individuals may have many good reasons to doubt bitcoin.

You've highlighted one of the biggest weaknesses about crypto, and one that I've never seen addressed adequately by crypto enthusiasts.  The weakness being that, while there's only one Bitcoin, the number of "bitcoins" that could be (and are being) created are limitless. So the whole idea of Bitcoin being "sound money" goes out the window entirely.

When I buy it goes down.  When I sell it goes up.  Every single time so far.  Almost comically so.

But the moment you say SURELY it will rise, or drop, it does the opposite

You've made over 50% already.  Two fucking days.

I took the funds from the ether sale and bought some BTC with it.  As soon as the transaction confirms, it's all going to cold storage for at least five years.  I'll set a reminder to check the price once a year.  Other than that it will be put out of my mind.  I can't stand watching the price swings.

Don't worry, I just sold so expect an immediate moonshot

With all of the buy high sell low panic mistakes and miscalls I've made since jumping into crypto a couple of months ago, I'm still so, so far from even breaking even.  But glad to see the price rising all the same.

I panic sold all my ethereum yesterday after watching it dip below 140.  Just felt like I was holding onto something that was headed to zero.  Apparently I forced it to bottom out in doing so, as it hit bottom during the EXACT minute i sold it, and It's up like 30% since.

Article makes it sound as if another sub-2000 dip is inevitable

I sold at 2550.  So now I'm like, shit, do I just buy in higher (AGAIN) because who tf knows if it will ever go lower than 2550 again?  Or do I hold onto my cash and wait for a good buying opportunity, and then hodddddlllllll?  Agh!!

Will do!  Glad to be the sacrificial weak hands panic seller for the more savvy among us

Kills me too.  2-3 years ago I used to half-joke with my lunch friends about buying Bitcoin.  Never did cuz I'm a big chicken.  Now I have a little but purchased very recently so yeah...
