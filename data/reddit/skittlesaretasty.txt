He's a smart dude, he didn't make the kind of money he has just by putting out albums. He's always been a smart investor, it's not super surprising to see him doing this. Maybe more artists of his status will start doing the same!

I love how the woman is just casually talking/glancing at the camera while WHIPPING AROUND A RACE TRACK. She's hardcore as fuck.

I thought that and the Confederate response were pretty funny, to be honest

There's something much more enjoyable about THE FUCKING PRICE OF A BITCOIN vs. 1 BTC = x USD

You bought truck tires off of Amazon? Is there anything you CAN'T get from that site??

Oh, right, didn't think of that! I'm also nervous about trading in person, though, it seems super shady to me, even though I'm sure it's not.

I have been schooled in the ways of fiat, thank you!

The thing is, I REALLY want to buy an R9 290 or a GTX 780, but bitcoinstore is the only place I know with computer hardware, and they don't have anything new there. Is there a different electronics store that takes bitcoin?

I hope I do reap some sort of benefits! If not, I'm just glad to have gotten into a community like this one, as someone who's been a lurker, this is one of the most interesting communities I've seen.

Thank you so much!!! I've only been here for a couple weeks, but it's already weird seeing how much $1 of BTC is compared to when I first learned about it! What's the phrase y'all use? To the moon?

Well played, Lentil-Soup.

Thanks so much! My first bitcointip!

What does "fiat" mean? I see it here a lot, but never asked.

Friend, please tell me those were two unintentional puns, because that'd be amazing

True, that's what I was considering doing. Still at that point, on a profit would I need to report anything to the government?
