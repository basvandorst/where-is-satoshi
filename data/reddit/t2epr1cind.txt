Tyson, Great advice and very well written.  I absolutely agree that the IRS is going to get a hold of that list and cross reference FBARs.
Another factor is that there are a fair amount of people who may wind up wanting to take advantage of the capital loss in 2014 resulting from whatever bitcoin they ultimately lose in the bankruptcy.  Pretty hard to get away with that if you don't file a FBAR.
The ultimate tragedy in the recent goxxing has got to be people who had material capital gains in 2013, but then lost ~80% in the 2014 Goxxing.  Have to pay a big tax bill for 2013, and can't take the loss until next year - and even then, unless they have other offsetting gains, will just be sitting on a big carry forward.
It seems entirely possible people could wind up losing even more than they invested, after taxes.

Actually, if you were "hiding", which implies wilfulness, the penalty is much more than $10k:  "For willful violations occurring after October 22, 2004, the maximum civil penalty is the greater of $100,000, or 50 percent of  the balance of the account at the time of the violation"
The $10k is if you can convince the IRS the non-filing was not willful.
Oh, and each of those is the penalty for each violation - i.e. per year, and per account not disclosed.

FBAR defines accounts very broadly, and includes investment accounts, which are accounts that invest in securities, properties, etc.  
So the two rulings are probably not inconsistent.
I did ask in another post whether it would apply to something like a cloud mining service where the crypto could not be converted to cash, but the more I think about it, it probably would.

Interesting project.
Do you use a time and attendance program, and if so, does it integrate with your payroll?

One of their competitors already does.
