no, it's never a good idea to put your keys on a cloud service.  I don't care how encrypted you make the file or how you try to obfuscate it.  It's simply not a good idea, and you shouldn't be telling people "it's isn't the worst idea in the world".  It is the worst idea.  Keep your private keys offline!!  If it's "life changing" money, never ever store your private key online.  Never ever enter your private key to a networked device.

You can point to pretty much every btc softfork that has been done and show that they have been used to tighten the rules, because that's how they have been used.  That does not mean that they only tighten the rules.  Nor does it mean that a hard fork can't be used to tighten rules either.

"anonymous nature of cryptocurrency".
@_date: 2018-09-23 23:26:49
I dunno dude.  Plausible.  An old guy, I became friends with in my condo, did something similar.  A stranger calls him and tells him that he worked for Microsoft and his pc was infected.  He had my friend visit a website that downloaded an executable, so he could help him “clean his pc”.  The executable gave this shitbird full access to his pc.  He also gave the shitbird his credit card info.
After the fact, my friend tells me he took care of a computer problem on his own.  After probing a bit deeper, he tells me what happened above and he legit thought he did good. 
Yeah, I wiped his pc and called his cc company with him to kill it.  
Sometimes old people just don’t understand.   This guy grew up having a secretary do all the “computer stuff”.   He tried, the last few years of his life, but I think his brain was just not wired for it.   He wasn’t dumb, he was good at other aspects of life, didn’t suffer from dementia or anything like that.  In the end, his heart failed him.  I do miss that old guy.

That's a very bad analogy.  A hard fork changes the rules of consensus.  The change could "relax" or "tighten" whatever rule you're changing/adding.  A soft fork fools the non upgraded nodes into thinking the consensus rules haven't changed.

Kidding.   But I am a bit worried about a lot of non-technical people being told to manage their own keys.
I do tell friends, if they plan on getting more than a thousand, go buy a trezor or ledger.  But still then, I tell them multiple times, keep that seed secure.  There is no customer support if you loose that.  It still scares me though, because these people grew up with always having a “forgot password” option  at their disposal.

That statement I would agree with, though you're limited to just the nodes where you're client initiated the connection.  The previous is worded porly if that's what you were trying to get a across.


Your response is not the same as "incoming connection".  An incoming connection is a TCP SYN from another node, initating the TCP 3 way handshake.  Thus you must have the port open/forwarded in your firewall/nat router for an "incoming connection".

When talking about TCP, there's the concept of client and server.  A client initiates the TCP socket.  A server listens for an incoming socket request.  Once the socket is established(3 way tcp handshake), data can flow in both directions.  But whe we talk about "incoming connections", that's reffercing when your node is TCP server, listening for incoming socket requests(tcp,syn).  
@_date: 2018-02-18 17:10:42

This...  There was a huge influx of new people into crypto.  So many thought they were crypto geniuses because they bought something that went up.  Late 2017, you could throw monies at just about any coin and it went up.  The market was crazy stupid.  They didn't learn from mistakes of the past (mt gox). So often, I'd read or hear on discord, people want to be "shilled" a coin, because they're too lazy to do the research.  And as long as everything trended upward, everyone was a crypto genius.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:17:23
Does come across as a bit scammy.. but you're most likely the one to be scammed.  So be careful who you have your friend send BTC to. As long as the person playing man in the middle gets 6 or more confirmations before sending money via Google Wallet or something, that person in the middle really can't be scammed at that point.  But you're putting an awful lot of trust on that person in the middle.
Should really just hit up one of your regular clients to float you some cash until your next visit.

After a 900% gain?
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:09:29
Just so you know... the fact that you "lol" your own messages, tells everyone what kind of person you are. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:57:33


Nope, never said that, but feel free to go back and re-read.  Just said, 900% gain, 65% drop in an emerging asset class.  That seems like a pretty liberal use of the word crash.
I'd take that kind of "crash" any year.  That's the kind of "crash" that makes ya rich!  If you want to call it a crash, C'est la vie.

I don't give 2 shits what you do son.

All you’re doing is repeating yourself.  When you think of something new, let me know.  I’ll leave my phone on just for you.
In the meantime, you may want to try and do something about that chip on your shoulder.  I’m sure you’ll be a happier person.

Pretty liberal with the word "crash", huh?

DNS is just a service on top of the internet.

Good comeback

Or so they say.  Many say.  Take it with a grain of salt.

I'm confused.. is this still a secret ballot?  Article is unclear.

Bitcoin future users everyone...  
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:24:35
Just like all the other bitcoin "crashes"?  Keep on troll'n on from your parent's basement.  I got some more time to waste on this train. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 01:23:10
Well, not we will
@_date: 2016-10-23 06:15:30
I think you confuse "internet" with "www".  The internet is interconnected networks.  Serverfarms serve content over the internet.  The internet delivers the content.  The internet is decentralized. Services on to of the internet are often centralized, but not in all cases, i.e. Bitcoin and Torrents.
The problem yesterday was DNS(a service on top of the internet) is too centralized. Easier to attack.

PayPal froze the funds for 1-6 months, to cover any possible chargebacks from the users/credit card companies.

Oh, someone got his feelings hurt huh?  You're really lashing out now. 
Bitcoin is an emerging market. It's volatile af. Anyone getting into this space should clearly know that.  Are you going to call every drop a "crash"?  900% gain, 65% drop.  Oh noes.  
Housing market is a different beast.  No one expects 20% swings in a day.

"For those of you who don’t server node".
I think the writer accidentally a word, in the first sentence.  True sign of a well thought out and reviewed piece.

When writing an article for publication, best to proof read.  When the first sentence of a publication contains grammatical errors, every point after (no matter how valid), is suspect.
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:17:35
Still not grammatically correct.  Even with that distinction.
