Hi there- I know this has been asked any number of times and answered- but what’s a good, simple way to gift BTC to someone who is not familiar with it? These people live out of state.

“Bitcoin Core” my ass

Yeah time to go all in

Funny you mention that - my wife was aghast the other day when (pretty much since 2011) I decided to purchase some stuff on Purse.io (message me for a referral link if you’re nice). 
Anyways, I at one point had amassed as many as 20+ Bitcoin back in 2011, but ended up spending the rest of it on SR and Satoshidice in a fit of spendthriftiness... but this makes me feel better - my sacrifices helped pave the way for this to be a legit asset class, and (IMHO) for BTC to attain the status of a major world reserve currency sometime within the next decade....

I do. 
I consider it a savings account denominated in what is clearly destined to be the primary world reserve currency.

No way. Over 10K? Sure.

I think it’s reasonable to prepare for a six months-ish mini-bear market at this point. Even in diydudeworld there are recognizable market cycles, right?

We may be about to witness the biggest bear trap in Bitcoin history

I bought 70 bucks worth of DOGE

So.... we’ve had an unprecedented dump, broken market structure, and are back in what seems to be a new bear market.
Apparently Bitcoin is dead.
How does sentiment now compare with previous occasions where we’ve had unprecedented dumps (which now are precedent) and broken market structure etc.?

That’s very Occams Razorey of you

Rich people aren't geniuses just because they're rich. And the ones who stay rich are the ones who understand this and don't start making risky plays outside their zone of competence, I would think.

EW analysis and trading psychology seem pretty relevant here. This crash happened at almost exactly 100% gain from the low of 6k. Perfect time to cash out, given the gigantic crash that just preceded this reversal, which has been on everyone's minds. It's the C leg

If it all goes to zero you won't have to do anything

Trending up...? Looks like a standard bear flag to me
