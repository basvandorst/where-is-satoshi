In the forum link that he posted, it downloads an EXE file and executes it. So what OP failed to mention was that he also go the Windows Vista/7/8 shield asking him permission to gain root access to the system...
So he not only got a "Java wants to run" pop-up, but he also should have gotten a Windows shield pop-up too (similarly to when you install an application). If he didn't, then we're talking about some zero day Windows attack that can elevate itself without user knowledge - OR - OP turned off that feature (which isn't smart for an end user). AKA I can't feel toooo sorry for him. He was warned at least twice lol

You totally hit the nail on the head!
Ever since I started using iTunes more, I've been purchasing nearly all my content from it. It's actually harder and more annoying to use bit torrent now. I also have a sizable Blu-ray collection, and I'm actually selling them off to purchase the movies within iTunes. I've already lost two BD's and scratched another. Can't happen with digital storage! I believe BTC will be just as beneficial. BTC needs to somehow get over the exchange hurdle (we're getting there)!

Yes, we're talking about gigahashes. And I think you're refering to *mega*hashes with your cards resulting in 2 gigahases. I used the --gpu-powertune 20 flag with cgminer and it kept the clock speeds up. Otherwise it'll flip-flop between your OC rate and 850 MHz, maxing out at about 500 MH/s per card. I've got my cards at a steady 1100MHz @ about 580-590 MH/s - very stable too! I have a few machines mining, and I reconfigured all of them. Before I was getting about 3.7 GH/s, now it's 4.2 GH/s :-)

Let me tell you a story about a friend I know, let's call him SultraPARC. When he was a horny little 13 year old, he "borrowed" his dad's credit card and signed up for playboy online (it was one of the few porn sites back in the 90's) and got all the free porn that he could fap to. Now just because he had a credit card in hand didn't make him 18, did it?
@_date: 2013-04-22 22:12:18
You can get two 5950's for that price and mine @ 1,160 MH/s using about 460 watts. FPGA's are just too expensive right now to be useful for mining. Also 1-2 bitcoins is a big variance. To be exact, you're mining 1.36 bitcoins a month at the current difficulty.
And because I'm bored I did the math - it would cost about $18/mo vs $10/mo, but would give you 1.98 btc vs 1.36 (or nearly $100 more a month). Math!

FPGA and cheap don't go into the same sentence. For just the chip (no board) that can do 200MH/s or so you're looking at $180. You can buy a Radeon HD 7850 for that and get 340 MH/s and have a video card!

I'm not a lawyer, but you'd think that you wouldn't have to explain this to a judge. As far as they're concerned this is another type of security. What will be the deciding point is if declaring a $1,000 inactivity is appropriate or not. Any other business couldn't get away with this, I don't see why a securities exchange could. Like many others have said a lot of companies' throw legal mumbo jumbo in their ToS as a first line of defense - even if it doesn't hold up in court. And I doubt their inactivity fee's of such magnitude would. In the US if Fidelity, Charles Schwab, et al tried this bullshit their would be a giant class action lawsuit and no one would use them.

This is a great site that runs down the how electronic trading works with both the NYSE and Nasdaq (both use two very different systems). If you're already familiar between the two skip down to SuperDOT, ECNs, and SOES to understand how the systems work. As mentioned above, these machines don't even get close to touching the internet. Your broker has access to them, or if you're a big shot trader, you can afford to access it OR you can even put your own system on these networks! Many HFT's run on these networks because of extremely low latency and you can kick off bulk orders much more quickly. Some people suggest that the flash crash of 2010 was attributed to bad code in one of the servers on the ECN that triggered a massive sell off... It's all pretty cool stuff!

Like I said yesterday, I'll take an 11% dip over an 80% dip any day! They made significantly less money this time. Remember that they're most likely renting these botnets out for attacks which cost money. Who knows how much they really made after it was all said and done - but it certainly wasn't 11%! :-)
@_date: 2013-04-26 12:00:19
Whoa that's high! I use Fidelity and have used Interactive Brokers. Fidelity's fee schedule is a flat $7.95/trade. They charge like 1% for margin trades. IB charges by the share volume. If you're a light trader, then that's $0.005/share. If your trade volume is 300,001+ shares a month then that drops down to $0.0035, 300,001-3,000,000 Shares/month is $0.002 and so on... They also charge like nothing for margin trades. Interactive Brokers also has an API (just like 'Gox) and allows people to perform trades just like what OP posted. Fidelity does not allow access to API's.
Saying that, it honestly looks like a broken script with the bot or the trader is trying to peg the price @ 145... I think Mt. Gox should allow bots via the API - but have two types of fee schedules. One for your typical trader where you charge a flat rate (but with no access to API's, just the web interface) and another with a volume based fee schedule that allows access to the API.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:36:03
So as a "passerby" yesterday, I legitimately thought the low volume trading was because of a cooling off period from the previous day (price pop and subsequent run up) and maybe even some light consolidation (can't make any money when a stock is consolidating - as you pointed out!). If the DDoS attack was as serious as it was during the crash - then this is a tremendous feat!
Most impressive.

Pretty much same here. I'm holding as long as it doesn't dip wayyyy below EMA 21 line. If you look at the charts it hasn't gone below that line in almost two months. And when it has it you get a power surge the next following days. I bought (mined) in at $100/coin so either way I'll make a profit :-)
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:31:49
It was definitely a sell off. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the bigger players had a trailing stop setup which triggered some of the larger dips. If you look at the volume hour by hour you can see that happening. You see high volume sell off at most of the previous support regions from the previous days/week. Probably a good time to buy, if you can. I'll stick with mining ;-)

So Gox is back. Dipped to $110 (with a big ass 4,000 buy wall) and is back to $122.70. So at the $110 low it was a 12% dip and now it's only a 3% dip. I'll take that "sell off" any day over the 80% dip that happened with the last DDoS. I think people are trading with cooler heads this time. As another poster said, the DDoS'ing will stop in the future if we as traders don't panic sell because then there is no profit for the attackers. This is all around good news today! Plus I think whoever is/was attacking on a Sunday was kinda dumb. They were probably hoping that today would be a light volume day to further manipulate the price, but a bitcoin exchange isn't your average fiat/stock exchange (majority of volume is on a 9-5 weekday).

Buffet does indeed buy stock, but what people here need to understand is that Buffet is a very conservative investor!!! He's not going to just bounce around from one "next best thing" to the next - that's a great way for an investor to loose their money. I can garantee you that if Bitcoin matures and picks up over the next decade (yes 10 years), and if he's still alive - he'd *consider* it.
He's not looking to make 50% profits overnight, he's looking for investments that will net him like 5% or so a year that's a sound investment so the likely hood of it loosing money is minimal. I mean the guy is one smart mofo, but he takes a very different look on investments than day traders or other, more aggressive investors.
I remember a few years ago right before the market dropped Berkshire Hathaway was about to hit $150,000/share (yes, one hundred and fifty thousand dollars a share). He was asked if he'd consider splitting the stock. His reply was simply along the lines of "are you crazy, the reason why we don't split it is to keep speculators out of pricing our stock value" (paraphrasing). [Butttt if you look at what he did with the company - and - stock price it's probably one of the best investment to have made!]( Just look at that nice upward slope! Dude knows that the hell he's doing!!!

Correct. But those walls can change, it's very easy to cancel an order. You can even cancel an order if it's not even completely filled! (Although the BTC that was filled is already sold, but the remaining BTC will be apart of the new order).
Part of the reason of the lag this week was because a few people with malicious intent kept creating and canceling orders (there is no fee for creating OR canceling an order). This costs processing time, and if you do it enough it can slow the trading floor down. Think of it like buying a car. You get to choose the color, right? Well what happens if you change your mind 10 times - the car purchase will be delayed because they have to cancel the current order and create a new one. This is exactly what happened with Gox. (simplified of course)

I was [playing with this software a few years ago]( and it was pretty interesting. I used the trial software and a test password protected 6 character password zip file with 2x GTX 480's and a 8800 GTX to crack a password in a few hours. Was most impressive. Think of a bored miner who knows that someone uses weak passwords for everything. They could target their wallet and temporarily throw all their mining hardware at the wallet with a bruteforce attack! We're talking about some miners having 100+ GPU's, which is a lot of horsepower behind a bruteforce!

I usually stop reading after the author of any story skips over the fact that the most important role of a miner is not "freeing up bitcoins", but as a payment processor. Without miners, there's no way to complete a payment that would be satisfactory (six time verification) to many businesses.
Personally, from explaining bitcoin to the ordinary people, they usually have a hard time associating mining with payment processor. Maybe it's time to *coin* a new term?

That's so far from the truth, I don't even know where to begin.

A lot of companies throw in ambiguous language into their EULA. They usually do this so they can easily terminate a user or license easily. This is actually a problem in the software community as most users are violating the EULA without even knowing it. Most companies wouldn't violate anyone unless they are threat to said company.
Take "items that are considered obscene" for example. That would mean 20 different things in 20 different countries. Hell that would probably mean 20 different things to 20 different people in the same country. But they (BitPay) will keep that in their back pocket in case they need to terminate a user giving them bad publicity, etc.
The site you mention above is probably OK, as it looks to be the "run of the mill porn". If, however, a site that hosts something like double anal penetration while dude is pissing on her while another dude is shitting on her back while a bunch of naked midgets holding hands dancing around them in a circle starts using BitPay and BitPay somehow gets known for supporting the site, they might consider using that bit of language in their EULA to terminate the account.
On a side note, if such a site exists please drop me a PM.

If you are ok with printing/ordering PCB's, tweaking them if there is a bad/misplaced trace, surface mounting the ASIC and soldering the rest of the components, possibly needing a scope to troubleshoot anything after it's all mounted - then you're good to go! If any of that sounds greek to you then it's not a good choice for you.
* [Making your own PCB with a silk screen process](
* [Surface Mount chips using a frying pan method]( and you'll need to know the reflow temps for the ASIC before you do this...
* [Purchase additional chip support parts ie. resistors, caps, voltage regulators, etc](

In the US, banks are required by law to report any transaction over $10,000 to the IRS. So get 6 bank accounts from 6 different banks and deposit $8333.33 into each. Tax evasion in the US is also a serious crime which will result in jail time and fines. You may also run into the real feds who may try to get you for some sort of money laundering thing too which means more jail time. Also in the US capitol gains tax is only 15%, which I'd be more than happy to pay instead of taking the risk of becoming bubba's slumber party friend for a while.

You could totally tune the miner to be horribly inefficient. ie on AMD GPUs. Set intensity to 1, work size to like 32 or 16, power tune to -20, etc. It'd still be faster than a CPU, but harder to detect because power usage wouldn't skyrocket when idling...
Edit: So my curiosity go to me... I tested out my 4x 7950 system (think high end gaming rig) at very inefficient settings.


[**I got this.**](
So it would be significantly better than a CPU, yet look at my fans (22%) and my power is negligible. All in all, they were pretty stupid to go full blast with a miner...

Personally I think LTC has a better potential with micro transactions. If you're a coffee shop owner, are you really going to make your customer wait 10 minutes or more for a confirmation vs litecoin's 2.5 minutes. By the time the customer is rung up and gets his coffee, it'll be about 2.5 minutes. Another part is there isn't a mining arms race as there is with bitcoin, which could potentially create a tighter knit community in the long run. Currently anyone can mine LTC and make some reasonable profits. With BTC you have to have some pretty big bucks buy miners which may pay off in the future. This segregates the haves and have nots - which isn't very community friendly (which is what this is all about).
Please note I said POTENTIAL.
Edit: Words.

I think what OP is trying to say is that they knew they were no where near having a finished product and hoped to get enough pre-orders to finance research and development - but failed to make mention of this when they launched said pre-orders.
There may be some legitimacy to this as if you look at when they were supposed to deliver the product (now 7 months late). Do you think they would have gotten as many pre-order sales if they said something to effect of "Hey guys, we don't have any working samples yet - as a matter of fact most of this is just vaporware right now. But if you pre-order, you'll help us make this into a real product... some day."
The fact that they had a big 'ol box of fans and an android tablet in their "Mini Rig" posing as the real thing at CES is a big ass red flag. I'm a computer hardware enthusiast and have seen that kind of smoke and mirrors before at trade show events! Vaporware is a legitimate concern with any new technology and Butterfly Labs was totally caught with their pants down on that one! In the hardware world, most investors won't even talk to a company needing an influx of cash unless they have a real tangible "thing".
Now you may say "Hey! They have it already, they've demo'd it and everything!" Sure they have, but these video demo's just started surfacing in the past few week. Now considering it takes 3-6 months to spin a waffer, test it, etc. we're looking at what I was saying above - they were using pre-orders to finance their R&amp;D and that all they were working with before was in fact vaporware with *maybe* a few "working" samples in the lab.
Now they're saying that the thermals are too high, which would suggest this is a first production spin. This means that if they want to tune the core further they'll need another 3-6 months to tape out a second revision! Add to the fact that they are *lacking* in the customer service department (being rude, not replying to queries, etc) and what you get is a company that's fortunate to be one of the few in the industry (only a handful of companies have working ASIC's) abusing it's power. Wait until other ASIC vendors pop up, it'll definitely spell trouble for Butterfly Labs!
In summary, don't hold your breath and I certainly wouldn't buy one right now.
Edit: If you don't believe me about the ship spin process time frame, one only has to look at AMD and the bulldozer fiasco. They had to do numerous respins because thermals were too high, bugs cropping up, etc. This pushed them back 2+ years! If my memory serves me correctly, I believe that when the final product came out they were on like the 5th or 6th major spin revision (stepping). Intel had a similar thermal problems with their Q6600 C2Q too. The B3 stepping had crazy high thermals (I was the unlucky one to have had this stepping) and 3 months later - BAM! - Stepping G0 caming out and resolved all of this. One thing to remember, Intel and AMD have hundreds of engineers. How many does Butterfly Labs have?

I'd definitely want both a stop and a trailing stop! If you're trying to day trade, those two tools are a requirement for me at least. 
* Scenario one: You walk away from your desk for 30 minutes and bitcoin has a mini-crash. If you have a stop sell and a trailling stop buy order you'll get out and back in at a much lower cost. You'll also protect yourself from a major drop.
* Scenario two: You walk away from your desk for 30 minutes and bitcoin has a pop or a rally. Your limit sell order is just a guess (and that's all it is) as to when you think it'll top out. So while your limit sell order is triggered, I'm riding a trailing stop at $3 riding to that peak to maximize profits.

I haven't traded stock in a long time after getting burned in the recession. Also please see my edit above, the information I gave was not accurate (stupid browser not updating...).
For simplicity sake, when you buy or sell something on the market you can do it in two ways - market or limit (in the stock market there are dozens of other order types). If you wanted to buy 10 bitcoins immediately, you'd want to do a market buy. Ideally you'd buy the bitcoins at the "ask" rate (if you look at the link above you can see what the ask and bid rates are). Not to get off topic, but the reason why people have gotten so pissy about Gox's lag is because their market orders were not filled in a timely manner, thus they were not given a "real-time" market rate (they probably paid more than they thought). If you want to get in at a certain position (lets say the ask rate is spiking, and you think it'll settle down) you'd create a limit buy and you'll get an extra field where it asks what limit you wish to create the order at. So let's say you see it spiking @ $120/btc, but you think it'll settle back down to about $90. So you'd put a limit order in at 10 btc @ $90. Now your order will not be filled until the ask rate drops to $90 or below.
Now to get to your questions...
Taking high frequency trading and/or price manipulation out of the equation - you're looking at a lot of people who just want to get out at a certain price point. Right now there are people trying to sell about 2,100 bitcoins @ $98. For whatever reason, they believe that it'll *peak* around there and then fall again. Aka they're trying to maximize their profits. Now walls can change, all one has to do is cancel their limit sell order and create a new one before their sale transaction is complete. Multiply this by hundreds of orders, and you get a wall moving - especially if the new orders align in the general price point.
Conversely, if you look at the buy orders - you'll see a wall @ $90. People are willing to buy about 5,000 bitcoins at that price because they think it's a bargain (aka they think that the price will only go up from there). 
This is just a very simplistic way of looking at it, and again I haven't traded in a long time - someone else may be able to do a better job than me. I'm sticking with mining for the time being, may trade later...
**AND BAM!  Hitting the $100 wall as we speak! Holy shit balls,  someone/people are buying 8,000+ BTC @ $100!!!!  This is amazing**
**AND THE WALL IS BROKEN! Let's see if it can maintain! It should cool off soon, but may keep an upward trajectory... Time will tell!**

If in the next year we don't see it go above $260 or whatever then we can call it a dead cat bounce. I think it's a little early to place that call, sir/ma'am.
Right now BTC has support at $100 and $50 looking back. If it dips below $50, then we can call it that.

About 9,200 MH/s spread across multiple GPU's. Come on 10,000! :-D

Actually the power company is! At my condominium, we buy our power in bulk as the entire place is not metered at all (not even the buildings). The power company comes in and negotiates a pre-set rate for the entire place and never once checks our actual usage (because they're lazy). They just estimate how much it costs roughly per unit and multiply it by how many units are on site. This is common for older buildings. I'm playing the worlds smallest violin for Dominion Power's shareholders right now :-)

You know, I always forget about the good old credit unions. I still have an account with Navy Federal. I'm going tomorrow!

Hey man, I thought I was great at day trading. I was making 10% a month with the market and then boom! Placed an emotional bet (damn you tvix!) and  **15 minutes** and I lost $12,000. This wasn't bitcoin, but the stock market. The only advice I can give you is never trade on a gut or emotional feeling. Use common sense and some math, you won't regret it. My mistake was purposely not putting in a trailing or even a hard stop. I wanted to let it ride... Got what I paid for I suppose...
Edit: And on this note I really wish I had some cash in Gox right now. Looks like it's gonna pop above $100!!!

True, but no one in the BTC mining community would join such a trashy pool. All it would take is a nice little DDoS to bring it down too ;-)

This! The current consolidation looks like it's about to pop....
