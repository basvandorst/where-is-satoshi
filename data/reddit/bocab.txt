Silver oxidizes away too, I was actually quite surprised to see how little silver there is. I wonder why people value it so much less than gold.
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:01:31
Scarcity. Copper and silver as a whole *are* worth more, but per unit they are cheaper.

Not op, but you generally want to do it with any investment.

idk but my GDAX window broke in stages before shutting off and freezing, yours might have just been broken too.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:27:01
Its fighting back now, but it did that earlier too so I'm still undecided.

Is this a significant club? I haven't heard about it before.

Can telecom companies start to ignore net neutrality now or do they have to wait for the suits to be resolved?

I've never handled one higher than the 25 denomination but it's still weird to think about holding the value of a house in your hand. I don't want to touch the 1000 one.

Lol I actually like that term. It's so juvenile it's even more insulting, or at least infuriating.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:35:29
yeah down to 17k from the 30 seconds tops that it was over 19k, i'ts still 3k higher than yesterday.

Normally I check every 5 seconds because I can't help myself, but this morning it's real-time entertainment.

I loaded it up, but I couldn't finish it if that counts.

if all you have is 10$ to your name and someone gives you 90 it would be a personal miracle.

After it failed to break the sell wall earlier it was very cathartic watching it go down this time.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:46:44
My bad, that makes more sense.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:29:11
People are people, when you give them money they are very predictable. I'ts not us and them, it's just people who have more and people who have less at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:17:51
Idk, mine did, maybe I just got lucky though.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:52:03
Haha I was showing a coworker how to buy and saw how low it was so I got some at 12.5 I should set up notifications in case it happens again.

I think it's more like, when you are below your initial investment, it feels *all* bad, but when you are in the black no matter what you can always shrug it off because it was still profitable, even though it could have been better.
In my case I got in a long time ago as a HS student, and BTC has payed for my initial investment, and now it's a significant chunk of money that promises to make my life go much smoother than it would have. If I lost that, my life isn't ruined, it's only *partly* bad and *net good*. Money is still money after all is said and done but I can't net lose anymore and it takes away almost all of the anxiety.

It's not just that they have a lot in it, some people dumped retirement savings in, or their home's equity, people just lost their life's wealth. It would be devastating, which is why you don't do that even though some people make bank doing it.

The lion's share of self discipline is recognizing where you don't have any and removing yourself from the temptation. Sounds like they are well on their way.

Only the ulra rich depraved people get the chance to act it out, there are plenty of poor people who would do that given the chance.

That's the smallest /s I've ever not seen.

It's just a fun comparison to make, that one unit of a national currency is comparable to one hundred millionth of a bitcoin.
It's not *really* significant or important, and it's not meant to prove a point, it's just for fun.
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:27:47
Yeah that's what I meant to get across but I'm not that articulate.
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:20:30
Sometimes I like to make people aware so that later they can't ask why I never told them about it when was still low.
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:58:15
It probably depends on what people end up using it for, if its primarily a currency then I'd say 10% of transactions. If people mostly use it as a store of value then probably 10% of holdings or something.

What? Buying enough food to feed your brain enough calories to do the reading and thinking for this post  and your body's resting consumption does in fact cost more than the amount sent.

If a company isn't paying payroll it's almost certainly either struggling with a new payroll system or is going under. In any case they aren't simply withholding pay if they don't want to be torn apart in court. No amount of legislation or unionization can force them to pay money they don't have.
Still a good idea for other things though. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:23:50
Yeah you should record how long you can go without checking bitcoin price.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:56:11
The don't have a way to bring it down, but they could stunt it's growth and maybe stop widespread adoption, for a while at least.

It's hard not to be, I was trying to find a friend a 970 or something similar and every where is sold out or jacked up prices. It makes me salty since we can't play anything together until he finds one.

That paper was really good, thanks.
