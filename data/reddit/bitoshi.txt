However, lawyers and consultants will charge a fee for their services. These costs will be spread among participants who formally join the lawsuit before proceedings are started.
You don’t need to hire your own lawyer because our group of expert lawyers, consultants and security specialists is working on your behalf. But, if you want your own lawyer, you will have to pay that lawyer. For example, you can ask your lawyer to appear in Court for you if you want someone other than Class Counsel to represent you.

I can answer 1 based on his replies, it's gone. People who borrowed usd can't pay back via selling btc ( yes it's gone ). 
@_date: 2016-08-16 06:30:54
People said they won't pay back 64%. They did. People said they won't release the tokens. They did. People said they would come back online for trading or margin trading. They did. They said they won't buy back the coins. They said they will pay back $1 on the tokens. They said they will release more details. These things take time. They have delivered so far. Let's not get emotional here.

Correct, for legal reasons, they can't say they will. But from a business point of view, all the value is derived from the customers. So by saying they will and then not will be suicidal and no one will ever trade there again.

Pathetic really, he could've said nothing, but instead, actively denied it. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:33:13
Actually, not true. I did my research, used logic and reasoning to understand their situation and plan. They kept their words almost exactly post hack. I monitored volume, margin loans active and on books, cold wallets, etc to gauge their overall health. I knew the most important thing was lawsuits (which they had zero) and volume on the site. Volume steadily increased month over month. I constantly kept in contact and followed everything Bitfinex related. Was I lucky? Maybe. But more so evaluating risk:reward given the situation.

Interesting post. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:42:33
But instead of 5 years, it's all getting paid back in a few months, the one year anniversary of the hack. If you sold all those tokens today, you would get over 95% back. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:06:32
Except it isn't 65% and isn't 2 years. It's 100% and under 1 year. Furthermore, I am on the record during the whole time for buying in at 30-40c. So yes I have invested wisely.

@_date: 2017-03-15 13:26:27
Exactly. You cant prove either way, hence motives should be a clue. Which makes more sense given they ruined their reputation and gained $0 financially from it (since they are paying everyone back). 
They removed it since it was the problem. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:42:32
Motive in court and law matters, especially when there is no proof. Example: my wife cheats on me with my brother and dad, takes half of my money, flaunts it and shows the world my nude pic. Then suddenly gets murdered. Who is more suspicious. Motive really matters given the context. 
We can't know for sure they are lying, but giving the story and context, there's no reason for them to. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:38:47
Think about it from their perspective. Wouldn't it be better to steal 100% and do a mt gox? Why steal 30% and then pay everyone back that 30% after a year?

I hope you have not been using shapeshift for privacy. From wiki and numerous reddit threads:
In October 2016, ShapeShift's privacy policy stirred controversy when it was revealed that, although the company "requests as little information as possible in order to enable blockchain asset exchange. To exchange cryptocurrencies with ShapeShift you do not need to give them any personal data like your name, your location or your email address. You just send funds to a specific address which serves as both an order and a receipt." However, the company has also said that "all the information we do have, as a platform, we make transparent. We do not obscure any information." Thus, given reasonable requests, for information whether from "law enforcement agencies or private [parties]", the company provides the information it does have.[9]

Okay not sure if you are trolling or serious but I'll take this as a serious post.
They cancelled it because of large movements, what more do you want? The code was not ready then. After it was ready, they announced it IN ADVANCE. Both the time and that they will delay it if need by to NOT interfere with the rally.
The cognitive dissonance is real. The need to look to blame. Please leave your conspiracy theories out the door. This is real life. This is an exchange company that makes money from volume as their number 1. The higher the bitcoin price, the more money they make from fees. They WANT a higher bitcoin price. 
They do not predict the markets. 
Yet while this is all happening you dont look to blame zerohedge for the china banning bitcoin article. You are delusional.

Most methods take a while to get to usd to your hands. 
What I typically do is sell on Bitfinex (only due to liquidity, other sites will do too) and hold the money there. When I do want to get usd, buy Bitcoin and withdraw to localbitcoin or what not. That way you don't lose money waiting to sell. Kinda like a hedge. 
Some fees but during higher volatility, cheapest and fastest way if you have never sold before.

@_date: 2017-04-02 05:42:18
You 100% sure on this? 
From the official breadwallet site:
If you are using an iPhone and your wallet is still installed, we suggest you take an iCloud or iTunes backup of the app. Then, try to guess your passcode. If you make too many incorrect attempts and the wallet is reset, restore the iTunes or iCloud backup and you will be able to make more passcode guesses. Write down what you have already guessed so you don't try the same passcode multiple times.
@_date: 2017-04-02 08:19:56
If you have the backup seed, you do not need a passcode. That's sadly not how it works.

They have delivered post hack on all their promises. Enable trading. Enable margin. Enable withdraws. Paid some back. 
They've said audit from a large firm takes time. Not on Bitfinex part, on the firm part! What do you want them to do? Tell the big firm to hurry up?

Forgiven, but remember not to be emotional like many others. Lots of people dumped their tokens on day 1 for that relief. Wondered who bought? I did, I bought over 300k that day. 
Buy when others are fearful, this is the classic example. Easier said than done. Maybe next time you will see an opportunity like this and take it. Good luck

Considering each bfx token is valued at $1 to raise the 80m, I'd argue it's cheaper to buy into equity than dao tokens. Furthermore, most people would've gotten some by default. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 08:44:03
So losing 20% or less of your money is worse than losing 80% (bankruptcy) and waiting up to 5-10 years to get it back (my gox). I get you are butthurt but come on!

BFX Tokens were created in the aftermath of the events of August 2nd. It has always been our objective to retire these tokens efficiently and quickly, including through various equity conversion programs. Such programs may employ so-called Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs).
The first step towards participating in a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that allows for the conversion of BFX Tokens into beneficial interests in iFinex is enabling the new Conversion wallet in your Bitfinex account.
THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. Any participation in any SPV is void where prohibited by applicable law.
Interested users can enable the Conversion wallet by visiting this page.
By enabling the Conversion wallet, a new wallet—in addition to your Exchange, Trading, and Deposit wallets—will be created in your Bitfinex account.
Once enabled, you may go to your Bitfinex account’s Wallets page to transfer BFX Tokens into your Conversion wallet. This is how you will prepare your BFX Tokens for use in an SPV. Users can move BFX Tokens in and out of the Conversion wallet freely until the time you are ready to convert to equity through an SPV. Enabling the Conversion wallet or adding BFX to the Conversion wallet does not yet commit users to conversion; it is merely an expression of your intention.
Once you have enabled the Conversion wallet and moved BFX Tokens into it, you are ready to participate in one of the available SPVs. Details on the respective SPVs are available on the Conversion wallet enabling page and on the websites of the SPVs themselves.
Please contact support or open a support ticket if you have any questions or concerns.

Of course you had none. No one here admits to it. 
I am a value investor. I don't tell people to buy, I don't make up things. The closest I've told people to buy was at 33c when I said the risk:reward provides an excellent opportunity where you could lose 100% or gain 300% with a (imo) a higher probability than 50%. I used the example where a coin flip results in a $1 loss or $3 gain. 
This is the difference between me and you. I made the mid 7 figures the past few years where you still think 300k is the world. I invest where others won't.

IMO, this is unlikely, given the wording of the previous announcement, they are using profits and reserves to pay people back. I expect in a month or two there will be another pro-rata payment.

So it's bad news?

We are pleased to provide an update on our partnership with BnkToTheFuture. As we announced on August 22nd, we are coordinating with BnkToTheFuture to launch a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that will allow the conversion of BFX tokens to equity stakes in iFinex, the corporate entity behind Bitfinex. We expect to release final details and terms on or before Sept. 15, 2016.
As previously reported, we have signed a letter of intent with BnkToTheFuture, an online investment platform, to provide an SPV through which BFX token holders can exchange their BFX for a beneficial interest in iFinex. Since then we have worked on adding functionality to facilitate these exchanges within the Bitfinex platform. Redemption of BFX for the beneficial interest in iFinex will be done at BFX’s face value of $1 US Dollar.
Participation in the SPV will be limited to holders of a minimum of 1,000 BFX tokens. It is principally designed to compensate Bitfinex customers who suffered losses resulting from a security breach that occurred against the company on August 2, 2016.
We are continuing to press forward with our plan to retire as many BFX tokens as possible through the equity conversion.
Going forward, our principal objectives are to raise new capital to help redeem outstanding BFX tokens and fund investment in future growth.
We will continue to provide updates to our customers and keep them informed about the progress of our proposed exchange.

$605 from memory
I mean I agree with the continued inflation part, but that requires time. The USD is unlikely to lose or gain 10% within a few months. Bitcoin on the other hand...
@_date: 2016-09-30 13:41:40
I am expecting lots of butthurt comments. 
This is awesome news. 
@_date: 2016-09-10 18:10:58
If you have 999 bfx tokens, you just get $999 with no option of equity in the company. So you still get $.

They have said the following
-independent parties are investigating, inc the company Vitalik is working for 
- someone somehow accessed the server, and something related to bitgo (I didn't fully understand)
- they have an overall idea and changed the method the site/system works (not my expertise but was explained)
This was all in teamspeak. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 05:16:09
This is huge! 
@_date: 2016-09-10 15:18:58
Why are you hurt? Why are you even emotional? It's strictly business. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 08:41:55
Considering the dao raised so much without anyone even caring what it was, well, we will see...
@_date: 2016-09-30 22:12:14
Sounds like you have no idea what has been going on the past few weeks/months. This is wrong. Simply read the link and you will know this isn't true. 
@_date: 2016-09-01 13:46:21
Yes it would be cheaper, but they will not do it, unfair to the customers. 
@_date: 2016-09-11 12:27:12
You do not know my financial situation. I do not invest more than 10% of my portfolio in anything. Some say this is aggressive but it works out for me. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 23:38:02
Ahh my bad.

Why brute force old address when you can brute force any address?

They have reached out to several firms and (speculation) they are working with one. They did say the firms take a while to get back to them, not the other way around. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 08:38:35
My point is pgp addressed the issues you spoke of in depth and technical way. I understood the gist of it, not the  details. 
@_date: 2016-09-03 03:55:09
Because people are too emotional and not rational. Bitfinex is fine. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 05:59:13
They don't know exact,  but they know the idea.
Example, your house got broken into, you know it's the door as it left a sign, but you know it wasn't a lockpick or how they opened the door. You removed the door and use a guard instead now (manual process of withdraws)
There's a difference between Vitalik's knowledge, and his politics. He's good at what he does. His computer skills are great, his political decisions may be questionable. It does not affect his programming skills in this case.  
@_date: 2016-09-11 13:39:00
Actually yours very typical. I see it all the time. Traditionally, people would sell their stock or more recently, a coin and then bad mouth it and hope it goes down. 
In this case, people who sold bfx feel stupid for acting on their emotions and dumping on day 1. But the cognitive dissonance kicks in so they are even more emotional and hate Bitfinex even more. Furthermore, they are even more tilted seeing it succeed and increase in value. They look at their sold price compare with current price and are just mad. 
Just learn from this. No need to be bitter friend. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 10:03:31
Tumbler is most likely cheaper.

20% of all coins for a long period of time. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 08:40:31
Yes, they make money, a lot of it. 
They give you a rate that is not as good. They are basically the middleman. 
Example (not to scale): If 1btc gives you 100 ethers, they will give you 95 instead. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 08:35:52
I suppose like fiat. Usd, jpy, euro, etc. 
You also have MasterCard, visa, American Express, etc.

When your mother in law purchases Bitcoin, the top is near. 
Jokes. Maybe.

So you are happy with the proof he offered up to now? 
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:58:42
Greed = people using margin because it's free money. Maximum exposure and leverage. We aren't seeing any of this. People are still talking about tops. People are talking about shorting. People talking about taking profits. Right now a people buying. That's it. No greed. Dipping their toes.

If you look at his history, he's just a typical power abuser. Nothing to see here.

So many upvotes in such a short time. Interesting...

Expected a garbage post. Actually quality. Not bad. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:41:05
Not many are saying this at all. Quite the opposite.

Didn't you just use it in op?
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:10:13
While true, might need into consideration that this other person who did mine them also decided not to move them as well. I suppose he could've lost them. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 11:47:30
I love your logic and thoughts. Nice post.

Just curious, what made you buy litecoin of all the coins out there? 
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:27:58
Nothing wrong with being skeptical. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 12:33:59
Personally, depends on how much the transfer is. I suppose everyone have different thresholds. I would only wait for one if it's over $2000
@_date: 2017-05-20 06:58:11
The only ones that are 100% confirmed to be gone forever are 1bitcoineater and counterpartxxx. Also your own personal ones. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:19:01
Just look at Litecoin to see the future, kinda. They have Segwit and are a clone of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 02:01:06

All for 5%. Terrible imo
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:21:19
Funny thing is, no one is greedy right now. Most people sold some and took profit expecting a crash and pullback. So right now, I say people are fearful including yourself. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:27:01
Not likely with private keys, but more so with his friend's usb who could have been satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:14:24
Consider litecoin? Or at least have a look. It's basically the oldest alt which just implemented what Bitcoin wanted to with segwit. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 22:30:01
Apparently that might not actually be him. It is highly suspected that account was hacked. He also mentioned to Gavin ( I could be wrong here) shortly before he disappeared, that any message from him without a signed key is not him. 
Edit: I was mistaken about the Gavin thing. Was thinking of this. 
He does have a key that is rarely used though:

The only coins that can be confirmed with 100% certainty are the coins in 1bitcoineater, counterpartyxxx, and your personally lost coins. 
All others are speculation afaik.
