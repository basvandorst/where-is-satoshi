I agree. Also, i am not sure about this but a few of my friends who saw the insane price drop immediately started a transfer of money to dwolla (very popular among people who use gox). And everyone knows how slow dwolla is, so basically in a few days or so, all the people who put money in dwolla are going to be able to spend it. 
Too early to call anything right now. Hasnt even been a day since the big drop.

@_date: 2011-06-11 14:20:07
Yeah i would like to know the same thing. What is the fastest way to get money to gox? i wouldnt mind paying slightly higher fees

just wait until the mafia and other huge drug businesses start using bitcoins. Some might ask, well how do you know they are not already using it? At the current price (~$30), there are about $200 million USD worth of bitcoins in the martket and are not NEARLY enough to use for 100s of millions of dollars worth of drug trades that take place. I know drugs are not the only thing you can do, but the fact that government cant do anything about BTC and sites such as the silk road (silk road is a TINY part of the drug trade) makes them appealing to HUGE (I'm talking people smuggling $100 million+ worth of drugs) traders. Soon they are going to have services set up like the Silk Road and accept bitcoins as payment. 
AND THEN, the fun starts. 
The government will try to stop this but cant really do it (juts hinder its progress slightly). Then people are going to strt seeing how bitcoins are useful because they cant be controlled by the government And then people are going to start realizing that dollars (actually people knew for a long time that the government does not have enough gold to cover all money in circulation) are not the most trustable currency (and the fact the government basically has total control over your money). and then people are going to start adapting them and start offering goods and services (non drug related) for them. 
again sorry for mentioning the drug trade so much, it just makes sense lol
i dont see why this wont happen. i dont know EVERYTHING about bitcoins, please explain to me if my logic does not make sense. Bitcoins are still young and i dont think they have been around long enough to make speculations about the currency's legitimacy like the OP has.

yeah my transfer JUST took place today from dwolla to mtgox. as someone looking to invest, I am loving the price drop :D
@_date: 2011-06-05 07:22:51
Hole on.
same EXACT wording, but different article by different people...hmm...
@_date: 2011-06-04 20:52:10
yeah seriously. Applied for dwolla verification a week ago and thought to myself. "I will just invest now and forget about it for a while."
sigh... still no verification and the value of bitcoins doubles...

@_date: 2011-06-10 19:45:33
20 now haha. and i noticed your post was just 17 seconds ago.

The possibility to make more money is reason enough not to spend them. Yeah maybe they didnt actually make a loss (probably actually made a profit given the recent spike [~$17], but unless you are reallly desperate to buy something ONLY bitcoins can get [drugs mainly] it would make sense to use dollars. 
Here is a quote from an article from The New York Times, by Richard Beales and Robert Cyran.


What I understand from that is that bitcoins are not actually worth $17 (current price as per mtgox) in goods and services, due to its unpopularity still. Rather, they are worth this much because of the speculation that LATER ON, people will buy for even more. 
However, i do not agree with the article that this bubble will be the doom of bitcoin. I think they have a lot of potential and a bright future.

Through Bitcoin laundering it is quiet easy. You can indirectly transfer millions anonymously.
