1 Googol.
"Immortalised in common usage by the internet giant, a googol is the number – 10, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000. The American mathematician Edward Kasner asked his nephew Milton to name it, and a googol it became. But the next really big number is the googolplex, which raises 10 to the power of a googol. This is astronomically bigger than a googol – it’s impossible to write a googolplex down in standard notation even if you wrote a single digit on each particle in the universe."

Apologies. It's just I've seen so many of these posts. But I understand your good intention by wanting to tell others. 
The HODL is the communities strategy. Youll see its worked for everyone who's got in , and yes we've been 50-60% under at some point. Only get into bitcoin if you belive in it and what it can achieve. 
Don't try and make a quick buck you will get burned. If you want to have a go at day trading do normal currently pairs like euro-dollar or dollar-yen.

Ha I like you thinking! I actually use the same when travelling. In relatively safe countries (ie parts of Asia and Europe) the places where the guide books advise caution are usually the best in terms of clubs, art and generally a diverse scene. Vice is the leader and money just follows it - the downside being gentrification and the original people moved out - see Soho, London.
Unfortunately I never came across the genius of silk road. But tripped across bitcoin with the 2013 news of rising prices. Took hours to research it and then immediately bought thinking well just vice money alone will give it value but could see it has potential as store of wealth if it stands up to being hack proof.
Like yourself I've a keen interest in markets and stocks. Usually do better when everyone is panicking like 2001/2009. It's nice to be able to invest in things before they get huge too. Mobile's worked well for me but missed the apple bus. Lately invested in App based bank. Think there will be big growth there in future. Have subscribed to your YT channel btw!

Excellent well done to you. Wise to have bought another assest with the amount you sold too. It's sad at the moment that you can almost see an agenda with news/media. They don't let people make up their own minds. It's helped me reflect on how much of the reporting in most other areas is absolute nonsense too.
Where did you get your economic view of btc from? ie Do you align yourself more with Satotshi's ideals or more libertarian figures like Cody Wilson. I remember (think it was him) him and others were selling land somewhere to build a community of bitcoiners. Went South though I recall!

My argument is they should expect this as part of being in bitcoin. If they're sweating on a day like this then they've never looked at bitcoin price chart.
I tell anyone who's buying to mentally prepare themselves for a 40% drop and if they're ok with that and holding long term then go for it.

@_date: 2017-11-01 21:22:38
I think many of the originals sold up many moons ago. Everyone has a price and for those in the 2011/12 accumulation period (that werent Goxd) then their get out price has been reached. 
These levels wouldnt have been reached without the mainstream coming on board. I think many of the mainstream are annoyed with debt being forced on them so hopefully bitcoin will get them out a little and in the meantime they'll learn some economics.

This is called the trickle up wealth effect! Many new people here will see the gains they've made and press sell without thinking.
They'll proceed to spend their money on crap like new phones/cars other consumables then come back in 18 months time when that has all halved in price and their bitcoin is worth 3x as much. 
Have a plan to sell. Only swap bitcoin for other deflationary assets. Even paying off debt isn't that good an idea. Debt will get eroded by inflation. Those with proper wealth who will eventually hold the most btc are the ones who own assets which are in limited supply. Property / art / land etc.

Where did you travel on £8k? I done years ago when £ was strong. I done India , Sri Lanka, Fiji , Oz and California/Vegas for 6 months on £3k. India is really cheap and a great place to spend a few months. 
My ideal is to buy a few places to rent that pay a monthly income of around £2k then use that to find living abroad cheaply.

This is actually healthy. If price gets too stretched from moving average it usually returns to there then consolidates and moves up again. The more conservative people who want to buy will be happier buying below ATH.

@_date: 2017-11-02 10:34:14
Everyone has a price. When big numbers start popping up - their portfolio worth - they think what they could do with it.
For some who sold at treble figures that would have paid off their mortgage for example. Thats 15/20 years of no repayments. 
Some would have gone oh I've doubled my money and bailed out because they've listened to mainstream media and friends/family who have no clue on economics.
Everyone has a price where they will liquidte some/all of their bitcoin. My advice - only swap it for assets that are inflation proof.

It's called taking profits. $10k is a huge psychological level for many. Also it's risen way to fast recently and some large holders are just selling the huge spike in price and will be buying back in to accumulate more from the panic sellers.

Be advisable to watch some YouTube videos on inflation and deflation. But yes you are correct bitcoin would not work on a daily basis in a normal economy because it is designed to be deflationary. 
Only spend your bitcoin when you want to swap it for another deflationary asset, eg, a property.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:24:24
So when you bought did you expect you timing was so perfect that the price would never ever go below your entry point?
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:18:30
So so many have met their price years ago. Those who held a few hundred thought they were getting great payouts when btc was less than €300. Now theyre crying as the stuff they spent it on is near worthless.
Everyone has a price. If your not exchanging it for assets - land or house - then there's not much point exchanging it for something that inflation is going to make worthless. 
Bitcoin was designed to be deflationary. Some mentioned keeping some for their children - wise move and I'm doing same. If you believe in bitcoin you'll never sell it all.
