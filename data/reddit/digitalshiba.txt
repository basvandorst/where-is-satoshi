$10 to $40 transactions for me with the 'Bread' wallet have been around 30 cents for the past few weeks. Receiving party is notified of inbound transaction almost instantly and most of my transfers don't take longer than 30 minutes to complete.
Super embarrassed over here ;)

Its misleading. Not manipulation.

has the right idea. Promote it as an educational site - there are other sites that don't even have coin in the name that are charging people $200 for courses on cryptocurrency. 
Or even better imo, make a site that is better and more informative than those sites that are charging people $200+. Make it free and accept donations from the community.
Bitcoins.com 'Your free path to crypto.' The possibilities really are endless imo once you get enough traffic. Or...just put it up for sale - which is what I would do because I'm lazy.

I just can't get over the cost of a miner on ebay anymore. I could've bought a rack of S7s earlier this year at $149/ea....

All you need is a little technical analysis, this video is based off of stock trends but the same concepts can be applied to the crypto markets.

The main reason fees are generally high right now is because of the backlog in the **memcache pool.**
The fees and speed can be influenced by a number of factors. Mainly the wallet provider and who they are using to validate blocks - also **memcache pool.** There are ways you can offset the cost - be it different exchanges - converting to other currencies.
You just need to do the math and see what is more beneficial cost and speed wise.

I like that this concept is being applied to bitcoin, I've seen other currencies using something similar. Assuming this is successful hopefully it is adopted in mass.

Following the trendline 18k is a reasonable target for Dec 30 - if we see increases that fall in line with the long term trend from the current price point. (edit: Current price point - 17141.35 Long term trend - 0.00329)
That said 11,571.01 was a reasonable target Dec 4 to Dec 8 lol I'm pretty bullish personally. Even if a correction brings the price within the trendline from that price point we're still looking at 12k by the end of the year.
If the price point stays where its been hovering over the past few days I'd be surprised if we didn't fall somewhere between 17950 - 18790 by Dec 30.
Based on what I put together - I'm no financial expert - trying my hand at modeling though :)

People always tend to be ignorant when it comes to new technology. James states that he had 'forgotten' but, I think it may have been more of a idc scenario. 
Bitcoin was something that was just neat and interesting to a lot of people. I had nearly a bitcoin about 10 years ago - didn't back things up because at the time it was just for fun. That and it was far from profitable at the time.
Curiosity turns into a bitch when something that was curious ends up being worth an insane amount of money.
