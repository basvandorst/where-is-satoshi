I appreciate the tip and will donate £3 so far on Friday also I agree with your idea of trying to get them to see the value of accepting these donations via bitcoin also doing it via change tip is only to spread the word of 100 people read this and 50% of them either gain awareness for the charity and what it does or donates privately then this has worked thank you and have a good week

Change tip it and I will put twice the current bitcoin price so for every £1 I will give £2 on Friday

 When I get paid Friday's I will do at twice the amount :-)
