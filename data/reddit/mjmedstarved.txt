Good for you.

That's a good point!
I'd search for a ledger rep 'round here to ask them...

I've never had the problems  you speak of.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:43:41
TIL; thanks!

There's over 200k unconfirmed transactions right now; I'm pretty sure that's never happened before!

So, now, you're obligated to continue this love for Bitcoin, and get your friends in on it, too! :P

All good :)

What is with the internet and leaving words out?
I don't get it.

Bitnoob is good!

I made sure his account wasn't brand new, and figured if a small donation gets one more person cheerleading for bitcoin, it's a good thing for us all.
The more interest the better!

Looks like I missed it.
@_date: 2016-06-12 01:05:34
Ahhhhhhhh I understand. 
Thanks for the ELI5
@_date: 2016-06-11 14:53:36

Get something? :)
@_date: 2016-06-11 23:44:36
Watched it happen, too. :)
Now, if only my Giants can beat these Dodgers...

Exactly what my first thought was out of this entire post... jesus, people, life doesn't get fixed with even 100k!!!

People will need to buy BTC to unlock their computers, driving up demand; at least temporarily.
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:18:38
Yes
