Patcon, honestly, if you kidnapped and forced a guy to send you BTC it would be much easier and safer then forcing him to get cash.
Much less risky IMO.

Yea, considering the current tiny number of people who are 'in' or even know about bitcoins. It has a LOT more potential.

Fuck yes! This is awesome!

Man, this is one of the best comments I've seen on reddit in a while.
 I want another dog to love!

You are correct. The mere fact that we are all reading about Satoshidice means that (assuming the bot rumor is true) it is working. It is actually a pretty smart little marketing venture on SDs part!
We all know that gambling isn't a sound method for earning money, it's statistically stupid to believe otherwise. And anyone smart enough to program a bot, I would hope, would have the same basic understanding of gambling and statistics that we do.
I can't imagine a reason why someone would program a bot to basically lose money. This is reason enough for me to believe that if bots are run, that they are run by SD.

This is 99% due to me learning about silkroad. I don't have a problem

If you truly believed that wouldn't you be crazy not to be in bitcoins?

Just realised this sub existed.Maybe the mods of this sub just need to make it against the rules to discuss investing here? I think I would still subscribe to the investing sub but it would be nice to be able to browse and without being covered in investors, speculators and prices.

Hey man, 
Any interest in allowing men to do this?
I've done it on other sites but not since i fell in love with BTC
