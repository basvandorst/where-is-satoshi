But they're behind XT for the wrong reasons. I feel the situation has been manipulated into just circlejerking for XT and BIP101 and now if you try to analyse the alternatives, or post anything to the contrary, you get downvoted into oblivion.

Sounds shit.
Edit: let me explain. This should be about celebrating all bitcoin merchants as a whole and encouraging adoption, not catering to the elite.

Having monopoly power is defined as having more than 25% of market share. I've seen estimates for PayPal's market share range up to 60% (not going to bother with a source, it is clear they have more than 25% at least). They may not be a pure monopoly but they definitely have monopoly power.

Indeed, you are probably right. I think that deleting posts should be avoided wherever possible, but I don't think that all deletion of posts is necessarily censorship, especially as debate is still allowed and encouraged here. 
I also think NG's way is quite exciting. I want to see some actual arguments for and against all the BIP proposals, etc, not just people circlejerking for BIP101 because they got a bit annoyed at something a mod did. That's not the way to make decisions.

Well, actually, I personally have the opinion that it's been blown out of proportion as debating BIPxxx vs BIPyyy was never banned, simply promoting was is essentially still an altcoin was banned. These are corporations with a large interest in something like BIP101 which would increase tx volume and increase their revenue from fees, but *we* should be making the decisions, not pseudo-forced into it by large companies. Else we just turn into the US government being lobbied by corporations. [There's a blog post about this here.](
The trouble is, I'm probably going to be downvoted into oblivion very shortly. It's a bit hypocritical that the people of make theymos into a villain for "censoring" BIP101 but then "censor" anything that goes against their opinion themselves by spam downvoting it. It's basically a barrier to discourse that we have imposed on ourselves, and it's terrible.
Note I'm not lobbying for BIP100 or BIP101 here, I just don't think Coinbase should be trying to make our decisions as that's not what Bitcoin is about. Big corporations making the decisions for us? That rings too close to what we're trying to get away from.
I ain't going to downvote you for giving your opinion, in fact I'll do the opposite. It's good discourse.
