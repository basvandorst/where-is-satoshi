I'm not so sure the Chinese interest is rooted in the ETF as it is in doubt of the Yuan. Given the appreciation since the freeze I would guess that the flow in or out of bitcoin depends more on the resulting PBOC regulations. 
The lack of research in the global monetary events limits many readers to their local news that they assume they can whitewash everything with.

Where are you finding the demand estimates?  Trust me, if demand was there for ETFs investors would figure a way to buy bitcoin.  I question you assumption that people will buy the etf since bitcoin isn't in the traditional market.

Most "experts " that comment on the telly about markets or financials are paid schills who don't care for bitcoin as an investment tool since they currrently don't have s means of swindling out a commission.  If an ETF is approved and investors express demand, you will hear their tone change.

The interest for gold has grown from the first day a caveman liked it's reflection.  It's scarcity has make it more attractive.  Bitcoin's scarcity is known and limited unlike gold that continues to be pulled from the ground by the kilos every day.  Bitcoin is more functional in commerce than gold.  Gold is a multi trillion dollar asset class.  Bitcoin is $16B (nothing) today.  It's global application has potential to reach the trillion level in my opinion.

I might add that if you have an IRA it might be worth getting into at its current prices ONLY if you think bitcoin will hockey stick in the next 2 to 3 months  ira money can't be invested into bitcoin unless you either pat the penalty or unless you go into bitcoin IRA whose fees and timing could be a wash or worst if bitcoin jumps.

I believe that China could be the spark as well.  They're concerned about the outflow of money but what they should be doing is looking to see how to bring more bitcoin into China.

If the ETF isn't approved. GBTC remains the only bitcoin financial investment tool besides owning bitcoin. Demand could justify a premium that a buyer could bear if the NAV would meet the purchase price within a reasonable amount of time. 
If I had more pre-tax IRA dollars I would stil buy at this price because trying to wait for par might not come and I would be outside looking in chasing the price.  
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:40:13
GBTC is worth $108 bitcoin. The premium will disappear if it is approved for ETF. The early investors are trying to get what little premium they can. If the ETF is rejected and if bitcoin drops, their stock will drop proportionately. 
GBTC will actually have a higher bitcoin NAV than COIN and will be traded on the NYSE if approved. 
GBTC is perfect if you've got pre-tax investment dollars that you want to invest. If you're using loose dollars just buy bitcoin. Don't mess with the ETFs and avoid commissions and maintenance fees. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 00:04:59
If they get approved you might think about gbtc since they will probably get approval as well. The otc share will convert to the new shares and you'll be in while other retail buyers will be waiting until after the institutions get their share. Plus COIN only has .001 BTC where Gbtc holds .09 BTC.

Ok super trader. Why do people buy futures?

I'm guessing that the GBTC whales are trying to get out to cash in the thinning premium but the but volume isn't there   If the sell into the uav they'll essentially be taking a loss.

Thanks for sharing. The SEC can only do so much to protect investors. Maybe this has more to do with central banking concerns than anything.  Bitcoin is more of an unknown fear than than threat.

Who's selling?  With so much optimism why would anyone sell?
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:48:23
Let me try to explain a little more detailed. 
If the ETF is approved they lose any premium. To pocket the premium they sell now and reinvest their . 09 bitcoin AND the premium into bitcoin or whatever.  
If ETF isn't approved there may or may not be a premium but nothing really changed. So the assumption is that they are selling keeping the price of GBTC lower ( more supply than demand) while bitcoin is going up. So again the assumption is that owners see their premiums going to zero due to approval. So sell for anything above bitcoin NAV and reinvest directly back into bitcoin or whatever   .09 BTC &lt; .09 BTC + premium. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 18:28:02
I am aware of the other two in fact I own gbtc. The holes are in your statement that are so general that you assume some kind of position that you believe snyone will take your word at conjecture. Just because an ETF is issued doesn't guarantee demand. As I mentioned before there's an ETF for any class of investments anyone can bundle.  And again my opinion is that the bump or drop won't be as dramatic as some may hope for. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:23:42

@_date: 2017-02-17 18:19:58
I don't think that the ETF is having an impact on today's price. My guess it's the occasional gap in price between China and the world  The strength of an ETF is more in brokers pushing it on institutions and the commissions they'll make than pent up demand. If it's not approved there might be a blip but by means down to $500. Bitcoins legit benefits are way too untapped for the ETF to have that big an effect. Hodl

China's actions should not be interpreted by Westerners. As soon as they have addressed their concerns they will find a way to use it to the best of their people and country.

An ETF isn't just for IRA money. Anyone can buy shares. Here's what  I did. I invested into bitcoin with my hard earned.  My returns on my reyirement 401k was dismal at best. I researched what fund were available that I could invest into that tied to bitcoin. The only fund available was GBTC. The premium was declining and I had a little luck on the timing. 
The way I calculated my potential was by taking the difference between the underlying asset value and share price and looking at that as a ticket to riding to the bitcoin train. As the share price increased my ticket was "paid back" and once the underlying value  exceeded my purchase price I was in the black. 
People fear the premium but most retirement funds are longer term. The premium is nothing compared to the return over the long term.

Please afford me this short anecdote. There was this country store that had owned for generations. People drove for miles to shop the quaint store with their unique items. Everyone knew them by name. But they didn't copyright their name and an entrepreneur, not related in any way to the store, swept in and took their name and opened up an online store with similar but different items. Patrons to the store found out about this and felt this was so dishonest. The store online store exists but people now know.
Bitcoin.com is owned by a similar opportunist.
Here's my suggest. Exchanges must not call the forked coin Bitcoin Unlimited. Do not use BTU. This adds to the confusion.
I propose the new forked coin be called Vercoin Unlimited for its founder. Please use VCU.
Ver argues that Ethereum used the same name but there are more cases where the names completely changed. It's not his call.

I have been trying to post this. I can comment it but for some reason I can't post it. It's my recommendation to the exchanges 
Please afford me this short anecdote. There was this country store that had owned for generations. People drove for miles to shop the quaint store with their unique items. Everyone knew them by name. But they didn't copyright their name and an entrepreneur, not related in any way to the store, swept in and took their name and opened up an online store with similar but different items. Patrons to the store found out about this and felt this was so dishonest. The store online store exists but people now know.
Bitcoin.com is owned by a similar opportunist.
Here's my suggest. Exchanges must not call the forked coin Bitcoin Unlimited. Do not use BTU. This adds to the confusion.
I propose the new forked coin be called Vercoin Unlimited for its founder. Please use VCU.
Ver argues that Ethereum used the same name but there are more cases where the names completely changed. It's not his call.

If Coin gets approved, ny guess is so does GBTC. My shares will convert and I'll be in from the start where Coin will have a pecking order where individuals will be later in line. If COIN is rejected the probability for GBTC rockets up as they can study the SEC remarks and modify their application.

We'll know by next Saturday. I'm in for the long haul. An ETF rejection dip doesn't phase me. Bitcoins market cap is only $20B.  In my opinion it could reach $500B to $1Trillion. Imagine if Chinese manufacturers gave discount if their receivables were paid in bitcoin. Every currency in the world would help increase the value of bitcoin. The payers would get a discount and the Chinese would get an appreciating bitcoin.

Im not sure what they're going to do with out NTH shares and I'm a little concerned about that. 
As for the conversion, I believe the holders of OTC GBTC will be carried over and converted into the NYSE shares. This is a huge advantage since the IPO will have a hierarchy of distribution and individual traders will be last in the pecking order. 
Shifters will say the premium will go to zero. Theroretcally it would but if the ETF is approved, the demand will raise the IPO price. Probably far above the premium. So by owning GBTC, you'll assure that you own shares of the new ETF and not be chasing the IPO price trying to get in.

Nobody has to say it you're on the outside. We on the inside can see it. 
Bitcoin will forever battle efforts to control it. Is as Darwinian as science gets. The strong will survive and adapt. The divided chains that follow false signals will die. 
8 meg will eventually and sooner than later become inflationary. The blochain will become unimaginable in size.   Miners will be attrited down to only large companies leaving out smaller pools. 
2X will cause so much disruption for exchanges and merchants. It creates an unnecessary solution. Segwit alone will provide a tested solution and allow Bitcoins natural evolution to stay the course and not react to lies and Chicken Little rants which are really lies in attenpra to take control

When defaults start to occur the banks will tighten their loan approval process. This will restrict tge porential number of buyers and the supply of  higher priced homes will exceed the number of buyers. This will cause prices to drop and eventual defaults. Americans never thought that would happen. Banks had mortgage securities that were valued more than they were worth. This may be happening now in Canada as it is not immediately exposed but Gome Capital sure is smoke and where theres smoke...

Some argue to allow the free market to take it's course: make money using the "greater fool" and " caveat emptor" etc. But the losers always lawyer up politicians see the saps as potential votes to protect.

Gbtc isnt traded at todays bitcoin price. If someome wants to invest theyre antcipating growth. Once you are in the price will eventually meet tge underlying value and then go up. Bbut the price will probably always stay agead of bitcoin. Unless somehow bitcoin becomes mainsteam for institutional investors.

Viabtc is offering BCC in advance of the split. The price of BCC has been dropping in spite of BTC rising. You'd have to take the risk of allowing Viabtc to hold your coins but you could sell your BCC before the flood of sellers take it to zero. 
The supporters of BCC may try to prop up the price for a short while.  I doubt they will go down with the ship and may even mysteriouly have problems at the exchange where  you lose your profit and BTC so get out ASAP.

Only idiots too lazy or stupid to do their own research believe their dogma.

The order books are relatively thin at each exchanges.   They may be testing the depth. Sideline money should keep them honest.

I put my entire IRA into GBTC. Do the math of when youll retire and estimate what the price will be then. Todays price scares some away but if you look at it long term some think its a good investment. Like me

There will be more panic selling as,newbies jump in and whales cash out.  It doesnt matter at what price. Its like a pedestrian inadvertantly kicking over an anthill. Theres a scramble among the snts on the outside but by the next morning those on the inside have rebuilt the mound.  There are just too many ants thay and the nest continues to grow.
