@_date: 2018-05-01 14:50:40
I think so too. Not to $0.00 but something low. Perhaps even a low as high as the $6,500 price range. I think the bouncing can go on for months unless a sudden influx of adoption or something game changing happens to interrupt it.

This kind of thinking, the asking some big company to accept what we're doing here is a mistaken way of thinking, I think. I'm not here to criticize you or cut you down by any means, I'm writing this because we're all so incredibly susceptible to not being self approved, so to speak. 
Meaning, we're doing something new here with bitcoin. But, whenever someone is doing something new we want the big boys to notice us, we seek their stamp of approval, their recognition of our legitimacy. It's a patriarchal worship type of thing, and like I said, we're all susceptible to it if we're not watchful.
As a side note: Lately it seems like the whole internet is merely a handful of big companies that continually buy smaller companies, and we're all increasingly using the service of just a few companies or their subsidiaries. - I hope a critical mass of us finally realize the cycle of giving huge companies so much power/control, then feeling locked in, limited, or invisible to them.

I'm 50/50 on secret hidden agendas when it comes to things I don't full understand. I was referring to the process of getting the best deal when I said that the order gets pulled in order to sell at the current price (when not wanting to sell BTC to yourself that is).
@_date: 2018-06-20 02:48:24
That's like 4,500 Bitcoins that were stolen.
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:37:19
Taking it personally is a known phenomenon in these types of markets, and it's interesting that we have a tendency to react that way. It's an amazing display of confirmation bias.
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:46:02
My idea of large amount buy orders that get pulled is, say they put a large order in at the current price. Then others put orders in on that price, then they pull their large order and instead sell to the other buyers that are left.
@_date: 2018-06-24 03:38:35
Nobody wants to talk about the price in the Price Talk chat. Part of the fun of talking about the price in the daily discussion thread is that it's annoying.

I'll just announce whenever I buy bitcoin so you can all know when the price is gonna drop.

Guys, guys. You know how I know that the price won't go below $7,830? Because I've been sitting on a buy order at that price all day. And knowing my luck, it will go to 7,830.01 and bounce up far out of reach.

In general, I stopped listening to people's sentiments on here about where prices are going, but I like to come here for the community and shits &amp; giggles. Everyone on here has been wrong, and everyone on here has been right, and nobody knows when they're being which (including myself).
I'm divining (as a game) that it will hit like $5,700 this drop (like some BTC rich maniac is laughing his ass off while scaring the shit out of everyone). But, I bought in at 8.5k, plan on buying at 8k, and lower. Because frankly, I don't see this dying. *I do* see the market being erratic as fuck, but it's part of what I love about Bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:14:18

What I wanna know is who is buying all this coin on the way down during the dips?
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:54:11
I think that buy wall is put there by the entity that's selling, to get people to buy when getting near it.

I'm into bitcoin, but can't help but wonder about this. I fail to see what would make BTC go to 30k. People aren't using it as a currency, less and less apparently. So, if it's digital gold then it's a marketplace unlike any that's existed before, and I can see that happening. However, if enough people get scared-off/burned by this and get it in their heads that *bitcoin is an awful thing*, they won't want to participate, there will be no room to grow. On that note, it's a good thing that a *bunch* of people still aren't familiar with it.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:01:29
I lost some USD to BTC. However, the way I see it... I realize that I couldn't truly learn about the market (any market) by merely watching graphs and order books. I had to start trading in it. I consider my initial loss my tuition fee. Because, I'm more cautious now and I've learned a trade (no pun intended) that I'll most likely be using for the rest of my life.
I don't know what kind of figures you're talking about, and how decisive it is in your life since everyone's in a different situation. But, if you've lost some. You're certainly in much company because MANY of us have lost some.
Nonetheless, *diversify* for Christ's sake! But, hey. Who am I to tell anyone to not be gung-ho?

@_date: 2018-03-26 03:25:01
One of my favorite things about this market is that it has proven me and everyone I know unequivocally wrong many times. I sometimes think that it will never see 10k again, hell maybe even 9k now. But, when I've thought things like that, like when it dipped down to the 6k level this year and I thought "Oh my! That's it! It's over!". - I stopped pretending that I know what's gonna happen here in the long run.

After participating in these discussion threads for weeks now, I notice there's a lot of people who want December 2017 to keep happening, probably some of the newer folk like myself, but in all likelihood you're better off just changing your investment/trading strategy.
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:10:16
My guess is that it won't go that low. The threat always looms nonetheless because I feel like nobody's buying coins except us coiners right now, and I hope there's a lot of us world wide.
I started as a hodler, then got scared and sold. Then I started daytrading and that's been going "meh". So now I'd like to buy low and hold some, and keep day trading some.
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:27:40
I now know why acquaintances who've been investors longer than I only look at their portfolio a few times a year, because FUD is difficult to ignore and is contagious.
Having said that, my FUDy-duddy mood today is saying that this fluctuation at 8k is looking a lot like not being able to break through 9k last week, and 10k the week before that.
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:20:19
The exchanges show a unique market for each user in order to prod them into buying, selling, or changing their price in order to keep them on the site longer. This is done with the help of Cambridge Analytica. It's a test because exchanges will soon be rolling out ads and have a paid ad-free version. I just made that up, but it's a cool story.

@_date: 2018-03-09 06:10:30
I hear you. That's why I day trade at a price level where if the market moves against me strongly, I can say "Well, shit. I hope the price goes back up sometime." Fortunately, it does.
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:25:11
The main reason I'm not worried about bitcoin falling too far down is that some people's greed is quite reliable. We've been down to 6k before this year, and it bounced up to almost 12k on GDAX. Someone who has a lot of coin (and is greedy) won't miss an opportunity to make a huge percentage on a pump.
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:42:15
Me, I'm waiting for the right time to pounce and buy in. I don't know who's buying all this coin being sold on the way down, but they either have a lot of money or brass balls.

Mannnnnn. I *knew* it was a trap!
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:33:30
I'm not making any real conclusions until/if it drops below February's low of $5,873.00 (GDAX).
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:39:49
If it drops, the question for me is "Where should I buy next?" 7.8k, 7.2k, maybe 6 or 5.5k even?
@_date: 2018-03-26 05:05:10
That sounds reasonable. And, it sounds about right for the time being, although I love the weekly whale pumps!

@_date: 2018-03-18 03:09:20
First realize that my guess is speculative as anybody's. Nonetheless, I think this will go down to like the 6k range, the range that some whale pumped it up from in Feb. 2018, and then the same or a new whale will pump it up again. Having said that, I feel like a blind man telling you about the color green.
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:24:38

I've heard similar notions from people. There's a lot of hush-hush talk among people in the south. Talk like "It's the number of the beast." But, I don't even know where to start to debate the idea.
Would I start with facts like people already have bar-codes, cellphones, facebook user numbers, social security numbers, IP addresses?
The level of ignorance is *astounding* in light of having an information tool like the internet around.

This seems correct. I do both hodl a portion and daytrade a portion.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:09:06
As to *why* isn't of much consequence and would only be contentious, but I'm not really worried about the current situation. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:13:23
If this gets down to right around 1k anytime this year I'm buying 3 whole bitcoins! And than Lambos, my friends.

I'm trading totally unafraid (not recklessly, mind you) because I know that no matter how low the BTC drops that [it will come back up]( and even surpass the current level.
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:38:50
That implies that there's about one entity pushing the price up or down, and that they're the bulk of the movement meanwhile the mass (and probably not so massive) of individual investors/traders are like guppies with their 0.005 contributions to price fluctuations.

@_date: 2018-04-20 06:19:55

I swear there are only like five people buying and selling right now. How can it be that I set to buy at a certain price and NOBODY else's trades aggregate to my price? - Say I'm buying 0.05214 BTC at $9150.01 the amount of BTC stays at 0.05214 at $9150.01 as I wait for my order to get filled.

Truly, people should be happy that bitcoin is at least floating around 6k. Even if it went down to 5 or 4k, that's a great feat for what's currently only a speculative thing. The most exciting part of all this is that it's still so new that nobody knows what bitcoin is yet! They don't know if it will live, die, become a currency, or a store of value.
But, its staying power isn't out of the question. I'm not religious, but in my city the police reroute traffic on Sundays for a mega-church downtown. Some say that God isn't even real, yet "God" has palpable effects on us.

I've been all about the bitcoin but I can't see why it should rise in price or hold much value. People aren't making transactions with it.
