It has nothing to do with losing money. The damn price goes down everyday!!!!! Is that normal with something so revolutionary and valuable blah blah blah as btc?
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:24:50
What is your definition of low? The year low or the multi year low?
@_date: 2014-09-14 11:44:02
I think Barry Silberts BIT fund will have a good chance to be listed on the OTC by the end of the year. Good times ahead ;)

just like your dick
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:39:55
I can take the loss. Let it be done rather than a slow cancer
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:04:09
you only lose if you sell.
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:53:07
 Ffs there is blood. Anyone who bought into btc this year is down. Btc down 60%.-
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:59:04
all you lemmings who have held are the weak hands. the strong hand sells chalks up the loss and lives to trade another day. you are all under water and you all know it.
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:09:52
I wouldn't sell at $25k. I just want it to go up ffs. I have never ever bought any investment in my life that has lost me more on paper in my life than btc. I have purchased hundreds of stocks and bonds and never lost 60% on paper ever

You mean keep throwing good money after bad into this shit. For what? So the whales can keep bleeding out the fiat in the system? 
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:22:10
Everyone uses this 3600 coins mined as an excuse. It would be legit if 50 miners mined all the coins each day. But there are thousands of miners out there and they all aren't selling everyday
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:03:33
of course it is being manipulated. are there any rules or laws governing what exchanges can do. if I was the owner of an exchange I would lie cheat and steal as much as I could. Who says the owners are not front running all the buys and sells at each market. there are no rules even here in the united states. bitcoin is rigged for the whales, big money wins again.
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:19:08
I am not looking to become rich overnight. I just would like to see the price go up for several days in a row. It goes down 1% every damn day
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:04:52
Just like your dick
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:36:30
Everyone said buy get in. To the moon , wall street blah blah blah

Lots to see and do in the Cleveland area of Ohio. Cedar Point amusement park is about an hour away. Rock and roll hall of fame. The Pro Football Hall of Fame about an hour away. 2 hard rock cafes, 3 casinos, 2 horse racing tracks. Take in a game. LeBron James/Cavs, Johnny Manziel/Browns, great food. It is going to be a booming city again in 5-10yrs. ;)

Pretty sweet idea. Great business model too. I love home cooking. yum
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:41:54
I can buy up to $1000 btc instantly and have it delivered to my wallet when purchased. I have not had any issue with them. TBH I am glad they are around. Just my 2c.
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:06:32
speculation???? I thought we had a chance to go up. replace investing with "throwing your money down the shitter"
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:55:24
Bitcoin is dying right before our eyes.
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:38:17
Cheap coins cmon bag holders scoop them up its a bargain 
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:42:16
Waste of fucking time and money
@_date: 2014-09-12 00:27:22
like a bug ;)
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:15:00
This is why bitcoin will die. Answers like buybusy more or wait 5 yes are like placating a kid by saying go play. Its bullshit
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:01:02
I just want to get out even and be done. you can have it.
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:35:23
I can't I am down too much like everyone else. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:02:08
I don't believe it. There are not that many coins being dumped to cause the price to go down every fucking day???
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:54:08
Ffs I can't even tell friends and family to get in. It's fucking embarrassing how much it has lost this year
@_date: 2014-09-12 12:32:00
I agree. But relax if anything hopefully we are getting close to the bottom. Then there is only one way to go. We will be part of the next bubble its just a waiting game.
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:09:32
fuck you. prove how many you have

I have been following the trading on BTc-e and bitstamp. The traders there determine the price, which is wrong. There needs to be market makers who are willing to be sellers and buyers of last resort like on NYSE. The traders bid it up then immediately sell off to get back into fiat. Until traders are willing to buy and hodl these markets will never show the true market price. The traders have no capital.
