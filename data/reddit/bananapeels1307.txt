Wow bitcoin sub actually made it to my top reddit news feed page

I’m genuinely curious what evidence there is that the likelihood for btc to drop lower is higher than the contrary
@_date: 2019-03-13 11:59:57
Solid points.  I agree adoption isn’t there yet and that even if it is, it won’t drive the price up significantly. Adoption from millions of people from third world countries with their $2/day wage would only be pocket change for the market cap.
If bitcoin has only been around for say 2 years, dropped over 95%, and never recovered in the next 5 years, then everyone would agree bitcoin is dead. However, the fact that it’s survived a decade on a gradual rise and has a recurring history of large bear markets decreases the certainty that bitcoin is permanently dead. Only ~1000 rich people is all it took to account for over 40% of the total market cap. All it takes is a few hundred more whales to enter the space or current whales to invest more to break all time highs.

If the nonlinear trendline was curved just slightly more to better fit the baseline then the projections out would be far less extreme than shown

Halving for Litecoin didn’t do anything. Not guaranteed halving will pump the price for BTC

Was going to comment about using a nonlinear model rather than linear but then saw your note about not relying on the linear for forecasts. Nice graph!

With the coinbase app you can instantly buy coins at their market value straight from your bank account but at a higher fee. With coinbase pro you have to first deposit USD from your bank account which will take 10 days before you can buy coins, but with lower fees.

Why not the nano ledger x?

The other cycles were on the scale of months rather than years so decided only to include the major ones

Just made the graph myself but might setup auto generating/updating graphs on a website in the future

Classic masterpiece

Ah i see. Yeah it’s the same exact graph in the website but i only graphed from 1970s to around 2005.

In 2011 gold hit a new all time high 2.2x more than the last peak of 1980
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:16:36
Webscraped gold since the 1970s. Forgot the units but could double check. It looks like the goldprice website only has data from 1990 and above

Also the ATH of Dec 17, 2018 is almost exactly a year from the apparant ATL of Dec 15, 2019

Bitcoin did almost exactly what took gold almost 30 years to do but in just one year

In a bull market best not to sell until you see the next 10-20x gains peak
