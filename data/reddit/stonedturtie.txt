Did anyone simply ask for the BTC?

This is correct!!! Check your balance in mycelium because it gives you a new BTC address after every transaction (in and out).

Either that or your privet key, not to sure

I'm kinda confused about this whole fork thing. Could someone lend me a hand please? This is what I've figured so far
I've got $50 in BTC in mycellium (Wallet A)  (pre-fork). So I should send all those coins to a new electrum wallet (wallet B). And then I import my wallet A private key into a BCC wallet (wallet C). So in the end, wallet B should have my btc and wallet C (using wallet A private key) should have my BCC?
Now my next question is where can i sell the BCC for BTC? Or should I just hold onto both for a few weeks and see what happens?

Thank you!

Can't you just import your private keys into electrum and mycellium wallet will show up?

Is there a list of wallets that support BCC or whatever the new coin is named

(say a wallet in question has $100 in it)
 So after August 1st import mycelium keys into a new mycelium wallet and then into BCC wallet and then there will be $100 in btc in mycelium wallet and $100 BCC in the BCC wallet? 
Also, anyone know where to dump the BCC at (or how to turn it into btc or monero)? Or should it just be held onto for the time being to see what happens?
