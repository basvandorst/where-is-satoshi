Is this a reddit gold feature?
@_date: 2014-02-15 23:06:58
Would like this too please
@_date: 2014-05-03 09:45:15
I am all for going straight to uBTC and call those units bits. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:55:41
TBH I don't think there is one concrete reason yet. Bitcoin the currency is revolutionary for developing countries, not us in the developed world with our ~~modern~~ financial system. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 00:21:03
lol well I'm stumped. Care to explain?
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:36:39
I think this TED talk might be relevant:
The Paradox of Choice
(start at 7:30 if you don't want to watch the whole thing)
Although it might also have to do with seeing a new payment option and then getting distracted by that. Once you're distracted you might decide not to donate after all.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:56:25
Oh and another thing. PLEASE BE WARY OF CLICKING ANY LINKS PEOPLE SEND YOU. They could be phishing attempts. You've exposed yourself as not well versed about bitcoin and you might be accessing a potentially large sum of bitcoins. 
If you do end up finding a substantial amount of bitcoins (judging by your replies it seems your husband was a super early adopter, and therefore a nice pool of bitcoins could be waiting) I'd love it if you did a follow-up post. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:47:04
Man that was speedy. Is it only the US that requires identification to use Bitcoin ATMs?
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:21:27
Yes definitely would love to see this. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 12:39:31
When I talk about bitcoin to friends I usually talk about the underlying protocol, not the currency. It's so so so much more exciting seen from that angle instead.
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:55:18
You're right, it's not really modern. I fixed it.
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:27:57
Honestly I have no idea. In the UK we have a tax free allowance of up to about £10k. If you don't go over this you don't have to file for tax. Might be the same in Germany. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:07:11
Yeah all I see is the logo on one of the pictures. No actual mention of Standard Bank running a pilot in the article. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:35:44
Wow. Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:34:30
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:16:37
... What? 
Do you mean


@_date: 2014-03-10 12:00:35
You should check out Electrum and look into creating a cold storage wallet, especially if more people send BTC donations to your Coinbase address. 
The current Coinbase address you use would be considered a hot wallet and is vulnerable to getting hacked.
A cold wallet or a paper wallet would separate your BTC from the digital world, making it unhackable. However you would still be able to receive donations.
Check this guide out for creating a watch-only cold wallet with Electrum:

I wouldn't do this unless you REALLY trusted the person. It's too easy for him to say "oh there were X amount here" and then steal the remaining. 
Take your time. Research bitcoin and how to use it. If there are bitcoins they will not be going anywhere anytime soon. 
Also, bitcoins are real money. You can spend them. Check out  &lt;- buy anything on that site with bitcoins. There are many many other places to spend your bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:20:54
This is a long shot but do you know if the UK has this unlimited rollover rule too?
@_date: 2014-01-25 21:22:02
Yes I would like to hear an updated stance on this too.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:43:02
I want to second this. 
If you do manage to find bitcoins, please consider spending them as bitcoins. Check out  to spend your bitcoins.

I am loving Gavin's new goatee.

For most sites that I activate 2FA on they tell me to write down a passphrase.. I'm assuming this is the backup code right?
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:38:11
Germany - awesome. I'd say they are probably leading the way with bitcoin regulation. It's classed as "private money" there so the government have given the go-ahead. Plus any gains from BTC are not liable to capital gains taxed if you can prove you've held them for a year or longer. I expect you'll have several places to spend bitcoin in Germany. 
(please double check all the 'facts' I mention, things change fast in bitcoin world). 
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:46:06
I would definitely sign up to Neo&amp;Bee if they came to London! 
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:26:00
The UK initially charged 20% VAT on bitcoin sales (i.e. if you bought bitcoins VAT would be due). They've scrapped that now and the tax laws view it more as a currency instead. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:11:28
Thanks for sharing. Hope it goes well! 
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:12:35
Are these bitcoin-related startups part of the incubator run by Simon Dixon and Max Keiser?
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:27:06
This is awesome. I can spend bitcoins every week now! 
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:21:35
I think it's a good thing you can't find your phone.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:25:37
Where can you see the number of views a tweet has?
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:16:29
He's talking about doing a second IPO, but using coloured coins to differentiate it from the first. So it'd be the first coloured coins IPO.
Not sure if that has any merit though. Neo&amp;Bee could just issue more shares if they wanted to expand.
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:31:58
The way I see it is that if I ever decide to sell btc for fiat, I will use localbitcoins, so I get to charge a premium. I bought for a premium, sold for a premium... Kinda cancels each other out. 
You could try opening up a trade on localbitcoins instead of buying from someone else to get a cheaper price. Wait for a seller who is willing to sell.
E.g. right now it's £400 to buy btc immediately, but you could set up a trade and someone might sell to you for £375ish. 
Or you can try depositing to an exchange like Bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:53:45
Personally I agree we need bitcoin. However as long as experiences similar to what you've had don't happen to people most won't see what advantages bitcoin offers. 
Neo &amp; Bee launching in Cyprus is perfect because a lot of people were affected by the banks - they know the risks are real. If they tried to launch in some other country that was not experiencing such a severe financial crisis, I suspect there'd be very little interest. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:17:03
I'm not sure if I'll sell right now. Probably wait a while for all the hysteria to blow over a little. Although it doesn't look like any solution is going to come from MtGox soon so the price might be trending downwards for a while still (just a speculative guess do don't take my word for it). 
If I was in your situation I would sell it as and when you need the money. Where are you planning on moving abroad? You could try looking for places that directly accept your bitcoin too. 
You got that 30 BTC for free essentially, to sell it all now and potentially miss out on an even bigger gain than the one you've already gotten would be silly.

Pretty sure they are a private limited company so no way really unless you are a VC firm 
@_date: 2014-03-12 00:23:11
So not sure how many people clicked to read the entire article on wired.com but here's my favourite quote:


@_date: 2014-03-02 10:22:48
Yes I agree. Although I don't feel like I was trying to convert her to bitcoin. 
People have already posted sufficient answers to helping her unlock those bitcoins. I just wanted to make it clear that bitcoins *are* real money, and you can spend them. I would hate for her to manage to unlock those bitcoins and immediately try to sell them for "real money" - especially considering how much time her husband seemed to have spent reading/mining bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:17:26
I would like to know an answer to this too. Living in the UK, if I were to go to Germany and then sell my BTC for euros, would I still be liable to capital gains tax in the UK? (Considering that CGT is exempt in Germany if you can prove you have held BTC for more than a year).
@_date: 2014-02-15 21:52:10
Do you reckon XCP is still a buy? From what I calculated IPO holders got about 9x their money at the current price of approx 0.009 btc. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:03:43
You don't need a separate computer for cold storage. I have my bitcoins on a USB stick with OS X installed. It's a 'watch-only' wallet which means I can see how much I have on it and I can send more bitcoins to it whenever I want. If I wanted to take bitcoins out of it I would have to boot up OS X from my USB stick or use the passphrase.
Check out this comprehensive guide:
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:14:53
MtGox is an exchange site for BTC and fiat currencies. You can deposit dollars from your bank into MtGox and buy BTC.
The alleged document is saying yes, they lost 750k bitcoins from their cold storage "vault" as you put it. This is not certain at all yet. 
So you are right. Once you are on MtGox all transactions are 'off-block,' so there is no public record of these transactions. Only MtGox has this information. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:30:34
Anyone had luck investing via LMB holdings yesterday (i.e. before the deadline)? I sent some BTC to their address but I haven't been credited with any shares on the website. Sent an email to support but no response yet. I'm guessing they are busy with the launch so not too worried but a heads up would be nice.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:34:53
Would like an explanation too please

@_date: 2017-03-07 14:29:53
Trying to catch up with block size debate here and wrapping my head around the different arguments. Are you saying the Chinese government is working with Chinese miners to break the decentralised nature of Bitcoin so that they can effectively control it? Would be great if you would expand more. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:10:06
Ah cool. Thanks for your reply. I'm UK too. Do you do HITs often? What would you say you average on an hourly rate? I'm considering applying. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 16:26:21
Also just found out about mturk... Saw this on their reddit FAQ page:
 
Seems open to US-residents only though
@_date: 2019-10-17 11:37:00
Ah I see. Thanks for replying!
@_date: 2019-10-16 01:36:07
This might be a stupid question, but why is there a label Satoshi Nakamoto on that address? Is this a feature on blockchain.com where you can add a custom label to addresses?
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:55:45
Who wrote this quote?
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:38:56
Haha that makes sense. Do you have plans to be in a serious relationship? How about a family?
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:08:12
I remember reading a reddit comment about it being the same as first cashing out in USD and then making that purchase. So they would say tax is due. Don't quote me though. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:16:02
How long does it take to download the blockchain? Any ways to make it faster? 
Also is Electrum not as safe as Armory?
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:32:43
Thanks. I decided to install mac OS X onto a USB drive. 
If I lose this USB drive, I can always retrieve my coins with the seed phrase right? 
I've been following this guide for Electrum cold storage:
Am I right in thinking that if I just memorised the seed phrase and deleted Electrum completely from my main computer I would get the same security as cold storage? (Except now I can't receive any BTC). 
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:41:08
So can anyone with btc tip? I don't really understand bitcointip. Do I have to deposit some btc into my reddit acc or something?

There was an event in London just a few days ago linking bitcoin startups with investors run by Simon Dixon and Max Kaiser. They were offering a startup incubator for 10 bitcoin related startups that would be ready to take investments in January 2014. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:45:16
!! that will be awesome
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:29:47
How's the relationship side of this type of living like? Have you met any cute homeless girls around?
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:41:02
oh boy 
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:33:21
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:33:01
Awesome. Thanks so much for your replies. I've got one more question: do you have any other friends who are voluntary homeless like yourself, that also have an online presence like yourself? Voluntary homelessness intrigues the hell out of me. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:07:52
If I don't have an offline computer, could I do the same thing with bootcamp? I have a mac with apple OS and windows, if I never connect to the internet with my windows OS, will this work?
@_date: 2013-12-15 19:03:14
Awesome this is super close to me! Definitely gonna check you guys out.

So I just downloaded the app on my phone, registered and paired my device. I typed in my username and now it says "Request Sent." Am I expecting an email or something to claim the bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:06:25
Also, if the offline computer were to break or whatever, I can still recover my wallet with Electrum's 12 word key right?
