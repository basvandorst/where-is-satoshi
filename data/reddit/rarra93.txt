Aja and how do you feed yourself? You fail to understand Venezuelans are less concerned about storing "wealth" they don't have than how they're going to make it to the next day because, when the grid collapses, you don't even have running water and whatever little food was left in supermarkets has rotten. 
So great, you "store your wealth" (gotta laugh at this... you're also telling a country that on average makes less than $5 a month in a rapidly depreciating currency to store wealth... and for those who do have wealth you somehow think BTC is a better store of wealth than real estate, land OR metals that you CAN use as currency... also in a country that btw has tons of silver and gold), how do you stay alive?

Sin electricidad aunque la red funcione no podras usarla...
Mesh all you want, there's no network effect in Venezuela yet for that to be useful. I know because I tried with mesh messaging apps. Not possible.
Phone lines were NOT up. Not even landlines were working! Again, I know because I tried. The few, and I mean few, places where they were up, internet was working fine. 
The ONLY thing that can and will work in situations like these is cold hard cash, especially hard currency. Metals if you've got any.
Honestly OP, "still growing every day"? You're gonna honestly tell people here that in a country where only 40% of people are connected to the internet, your bachaquero accepts BTC?
What BTC doomsday scenario proponents failed to calculate is that in real-world apocalyptic situations - [call me dramatic]( - if you've got no electricity and the grid's collapsed, as would believably happen, YOU'VE GOT NO BTC.

Right, they should absolutely spend their entire monthly earnings on BTC instead of you know... eating. You're delusional.
Get fed when no one that has or sells food accepts BTC... and if they do there's no electricity to process the transaction. Go figure. Contradicting yourself: so they should use all their wages on BTC, but also don't use that wage on food, and also don't use the BTC because it's very stupid, but somehow get fed from their saved BTC?

1. If this is referring to option moneyness, it's stupid.
2. If this is referring to liquidity, it's doubly stupid.
