I cant find the source video because it looks like the uploader closed his account

You know you're really driving home the whole "both subs are insane" thing with this post.

yeah, anyone who's been through any of the previous bitcoin bubbles can see history repeating itself again.
the correction *is* going to come. Anyone who claims otherwise is lying to themselves or lying to you to profit off of it. If you want to gamble you can try to guess when it'll happen and sell your coins temporarily, but be ready to be very wrong and lose money. 
reality is though in the long run it doesn't matter, bitcoin has always historically gone up in price and with segwit and the lightning network around the corner I don't see anything truly catastrophic happening.

a few days ago bch's mempool [got spammed and it was cleared in the matter of a few blocks](
that's something that would have taken at least a day for BTC to clear up.

yea i just sold off half of what i bought like 4 years ago during the bubble and media hype train cycle that made me notice bitcoin originally.
if it corrects like I think it will then I can safely rebuy for a big profit, if not and it keeps increasing I still have the other half of my hodl'd coins. either way I've made about 10 times as much as my initial investment so I'm happy.

Yeah one is something millions of people do every day and the other is something maybe a few dozen drug traffickers do every day. 
If you want to promote bitcoin as a viable currency you have to demonstrate it acting like a currency that the average joe can use.

And thats why it's not going near 1200 any time soon, because there's tons of people thinking same thing when it hits 3k. Or 2.5k. Or 2k. Or 1.5k... and pretty much everywhere in between.

i did something similar but I used electrum-cash

On saturday btcash will undergo its first difficulty change, which will make it much more profitable to mine. 
Its a safe bet to say at least a few bitcoin miners will swap over to mine btcash while its profitable
Now the *consequences* of this is debatable. The folks over in r/btc seem to think so many miners will switch to btcash that bitcoin blocks will be mined so slowly the coin becomes unuseable. 
Personally, i think a less extreme version of that is going to happen. A small percent of bitcoin miners will hop over,  exacerbating the mempool clogging situation even further and potentially causing a price dip, but it will be resolved temporarily after the next difficulty change and then for good when the segwit fork happens. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:43:27
Every single holder of bitcoin when the hardfork happened received an equal amount of btcash. You cant get burned holding something that you got for 0 cost. 
The best move right now is to hold both and wait until the segwit activation on the bitcoin core chain, and monitor the markets. Miners and users will move to the better coin.

The larger the blocks on your blockchain the more total space a node would occupy on a host's computer. Right now btcash's blockchain can grow up to 8 times as fast as bitcoin main's blockchain (if every block is 8MB) which can cause centralization issues later in its life when nodes become too large to host on a personal computer.

especially tonight when there's a very good chance the price is going to explode tomorrow. Tomorrow night after the difficulty change? It'd be reasonable once you see how many miners actually switch. I'd be very surprised if the price goes much lower than where it is currently any time soon. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:29:18
because they are posting legitimate opinions that OP disagrees with. 
"shilling" is only a problem when the other side does it. I'm sure OP wouldn't care if the same guy that linked thread is talking about was posting pro-bitcoin main stuff. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:37:28
Bull run in anticipation of the difficulty change tomorrow making it favorable for miners. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:44:51
Both subs this week have been pretty bad with conspiracy theories about the other. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:20:36
Lets also not ignore the fact right now exchanging "raw bitcoins" either incurs an extremely high fee to get your transaction confirmed in a timely manner or forces you to wait 24 hours or longer if you dont want to pay a huge transaction fee, neither of which is very appealing to anyone who wants to use bitcoin as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:35:42
Its going to go up even more this weekend when bitcoin cash goes through its first difficulty change and a decent chunk of bitcoin's hash power makes the change to bitcoin cash. 
Bitcoin has huge problems with its mempool size atm, even with a 100 sat/byte fee one of my transactions took over 24 hours to be confirmed, and the a few miners hopping over to mine btcash will make the problems even worse until bitcoin main's difficulty change. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:26:35
BTC got spammed during the same time period and fees shot up to 200-300 sat/byte for the period. I had to pay ~$3 to get a transaction confirmed lol.
