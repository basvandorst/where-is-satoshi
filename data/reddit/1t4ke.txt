I think you mean this: [Anonymous BTC SMS](
@_date: 2016-12-28 02:27:54
[anonymousbtcsms.com]( is another pretty similar service, but they bill hourly, have physical phones from multiple countries and don't recycle phone numbers.

ooo I really like your option 2. I thought about providing a free 1 month trial, but I couldn't come up with a good deterrent for preventing people from resigning up.  But if I drop it to 24 hours, then that will give me time to confirm their subscription in the system.  Thanks for your help!

I haven't played dota 2 yet, but do they offer saved file support?
Rather than use the API, you could just have both teams upload a save game of the file and check timestamps, player names, and checksums on the saves to verify winners.

ha, there is no way they have one guy dedicated to running the mobile page.  The only difference between the full site and the mobile page is a few lines of CSS.

Don't listen to this guy (he doesn't know what he is talking about.
We don't need more exchanges.  That will just reduce the trade volume across a bunch of exchanges making it impossible for large transactions to go through.
If anything, we need a decentralized exchange, but that would be impossible thanks to banks being difficult to work with.

Yeah I have thought about just doing it by hand.  My business is based on subscriptions and once they subscribe they have to configure a few things in the product.  If it takes me a few hours to manually activate them, then they may not appreciate the delay.

Once I pull out, that doesn't mean I wont go back in.  I have to make my money back, right? :-P
I would just wait for price to drop more and then re-buy into the system.

You are still liable for the taxes, but I think that taxes may only apply when you pull out.  So if grandfather gave his son a flash drive with $2.5 mil in it, he would just pay taxes as he cashes it at a lower rate (20%-30%) as opposed to the 40% estate tax.

The problem with having lots of exchanges is the lack of volume.  If I want to buy a house in bitcoins, there is only one exchange that can handle that volume and they can handle it in a few days.  
If mtgox were to suddenly split into 20 different exchanges, then the average daily volume would be:
4,234,785.6 (today's 30-day volume)/20 (across 20 exchanges)/30 (daily volume)*100 (current price) 
=$705,797.6 per day for each exchange
that is not enough for a person to transfer large amounts of funds each day.

Software Engineer with EE undergraduate degree here.  Shoot me a pm and if I can't help you, I may know someone who can.

coinbase is crap.  They have no support and they don't seem to allow customer data to be passed through their service.  I don't trust them.

It seems that you can store them using a one-way hash, but if your database is leaked and rainbow tables are applied, the cards can be compromised and then you get in some serious trouble.
I think the best way to handle this would be a service like Spreedly, because they offer a single API for storing cards and support multiple payment processors through that single API.  If you are planning on having a rotation of card processors, then having to support 10+ APIs would be very time consuming.

I am a backend developer and would be interested in talking with you about developing this service.  Shoot me a pm.

So re-calculate based on a pre-set dollar amount daily/weekly on the moving average?
This might work, but I find that the moving average seems to lag the market by a bit 
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:57:22
I am 99% sure it does.  You really can't store credit card numbers in any shape or form without a certain high level of PCI compliance.  That is why services like Spreedly exist.

As unreliable as mtgox is, it has been the most reliable in the last 2 years.  Exchanges have come and gone thanks to [hacks]( and [hacks]( [government regulations]( or poor adoption rate.
It seems that most exchanges were set up my high school/college level developers that don't know anything about security.  I don't want to end up like the customers of bitcoinica because I wanted to be an early adopter of a new exchange.

I can't upvote enough... I listened to 30s of this before thinking "what an idiot"
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:50:15
I may be mistaken, but if you put in a limit order of 50% the trading value, mtgox will sell those coins to someone asking for the current market price at the current market price and mtgox gets the difference.
I agree panic selling is a bad for the market, but as an individual I would much rather have 50% of my money than none of it.
@_date: 2013-02-23 22:31:29
hahaha, sounds like someone is trying to gauge the prices!

I can connect now too, but I don't see any trades happening.

cool! can you post the backtest numbers?
