@_date: 2014-01-30 01:07:25
 Happened to me today
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:36:50
Thanks for that explanation
@_date: 2014-12-10 06:09:43
Anyone know how to tip him?

What's the source on this screenshot?  Can you trade Gox coins outside of gox?
@_date: 2014-03-07 08:15:52
What's this mean?

How many satellites will there be?  If only one satellite, what will the latency be?

$50k at current btc prices seems excessive.  Compare that to the cost of a wire transfer

The US doesn't have to ban it - they just have to disincentive both users and merchants from using it as a currency
@_date: 2013-10-25 02:23:26
Sold coins yesterday and they were gone from my account, but now they're seemingly back.  So yes, weird.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:07:13
I have bought in .1 increments on coinbase  at least 30 times and have never been flagged as high risk
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:32:14
Hey OP, this is a pretty cool idea actually.  I'm new to coding, maybe I can build it.  If I end up being able to do it, I'll let you know.

It's a shame everyone on this subreddit is so brainwashed that we can't have a real discussion about this.  I also have Bitcoins I am holding long-term, but I'm not blind to the fact that the odds of it succeeding are much less than it failing.  Say one thing negative here on Bitcoin and your thread or comment gets downvoted into never land
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:37:33
I spend them on reddit gold, I send friends coins to show them what Bitcoin actually is, and I plan on buying some goodies on Bitcoin Black Friday with them
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:47:48
ZeroBlock &amp; Bitcoin Ticker are good options

What does it mean to backup your wallet?  I've only used Coinbase...
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:43:50
This doesn't seem sketchy at all
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:13:43
Sure they can never stop the small peer to peer transactions, but if they ban Bitcoin use like China has, the currency loses much of its value - it's too speculative
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:25:28
You're welcome.  This bitcointip thing is pretty nifty.  I think I accepted, but I have no idea where the Bitcoin went to.  Gonna have to learn how to use this myself so I can send some tips.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:11:26
Ahh, so withdraw the btc only, then if you want, just transfer it to your personal wallet and back it up? Sorry, kind of a newb. Appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:16:32
In what way?  BTC prices are going down as I type this. The high today on gox was high 700s, now we're at low 600s
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:45:06
Please do explain
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:20:10
much tip
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:11:02
Could you go into a little more detail here? As someone who's still learning about Bitcoin, I'm not really understanding this
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:15:07
They can't stop you and I from sending Bitcoin to each other, but they _can_ step in &amp; prevent large companies like Amazon from implementing Bitcoin in the payment process.
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:39:23
But the _currency_ you use to purchase these phones doesn't fluctuate much
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:00:37
Thanks for the reply.  How do you handle your withdrawals? Do you have a Chinese bank account setup somehow, or another type of overseas account?
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:42:22
What programs are you using there?
