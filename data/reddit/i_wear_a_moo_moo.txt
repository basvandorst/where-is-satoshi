Hopefully this does not affect existing customers, but I have a feeling there will be another round of KYC coming my way.

Is there a source for the X.com hack?  I had not heard of this and the author says it was all over the news and propelled them to success?
I did some brief searching and mostly just turned up this article...was this a real thing?

How is this number correct?  I'm running a parity node and it only uses about 43GB for the Ethereum blockchain?

BTW this thread has been heavily modified to remove any mention of exchanges that will actually list Segwit2x as Bitcoin. Sad.

In similar news: "I was just down at the Adidas shop and they are offering buy one pair get one pair free...this obviously means that Adidas has released a harmful toxin into the water supply and by the end of the month we will all have grown 4 legs"

hey I have no way to contact you because your dog always barks at me whenever I'm running new cables to your house.
I have issues:
1) You used to get the premium cable package...now it seems you downgraded to the standard package, and I really liked watching Game of Thrones so this needs to be upgraded back to premium.
2) Your wifi router is always dropping connections, I really think you need to upgrade your wifi router to something better. (remember don't change the default admin password)
3) Your internet is really slow; I'm running a torrent seed box with 5000 pirate movies and I really need a better connection than what your currently subscribed to, please an upgrade is needed.
If you make these much needed upgrades I'd be happy to continue leeching your services.

Escalate this issue to the Bitcoin CEO and he should be able to create some new bitcoins for you.

How did this "turn out not to be true"?  Were they accept US customers then?
