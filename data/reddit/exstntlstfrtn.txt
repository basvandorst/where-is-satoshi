I may be misunderstanding the bitcoin process, but from my understanding those who are mining are providing the computer power required to process the bitcoin transactions. The program offers early adapters of transacting fees an incentive by putting bitcoins in the blocks that are being solved. If people weren't mining, then no transactions would be processed. This is my current understanding of bitcoin, and I"m pretty sure it's correct, but point me towards anything that corrects me if I'm misunderstood.

but what benefit does additional mining add? just redundancy? I guess it is worth it since people are doing it. Aside from mining, does it at least speed up the rate of transactions done in a given period of time?

Could be much higher...could be much lower. The price of something is not determined by the demand only. Price is strictly a functional ratio of supply and demand. It could be such that 1 bitcoin per month is produced and if there is no one to buy it, the cost will be $0...conversely, if millions of people found that 1 bitcoin/mo valuable, the price could skyrocket...It depends on the supply and demand, and that is an important thing to keep in mind.

So, essentially, removing the consideration of difficulty, how much computing power is actually required to process how many transactions in a given time frame? I guess my intuition on it was that more computers were needed to solve the transactions as more users transact in bitcoin, and by giving early adopters the incentive of mining while they are auditing the transactions, the required computing power would be provided. I thought it was really elegant and clever to combine the act of mining and auditing transactions, while simultaneously providing a check against unnecessary inflation.
