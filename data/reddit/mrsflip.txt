Reports are supposed to be depersonalised, in a professional environment. You never write what you are doing, you write what you recommend is the best thing to do. Like in my field reports I often write stuff like, "the client may benefit from CBT", when IRL we've started it already.

I don't think it is responsible to tell people to move all their investments into crypto. Eggs in one basket and all that. Also, people's investment needs change depending on their life stage. The type of risk that comes with crypto will not suit some people.

Good points. I guess a bank safety deposit box would be better than a personal safe then? Those can be transferred upon death.

I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because, uh, some people out there in our nation don't ''have'' maps and, uh, I believe that our education, like such as in South Africa and, uh, the Iraq, everywhere like such as, and I believe that they should—our education over ''here'' in the US should help the U.S., uh, or, should help South Africa and should help the Iraq, and the Asian countries, so we will be able to build up our future, for our children.

Do you have to make a new paper wallet every time you transfer some? Or can you just keep adding to the original wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:07:50
Start an excel sheet with a balance you make up then record pretend transactions using real time prices. So write down how much you'd have bought/sold and at what day/time/price. Record your new fake balance each time. Do that for a while and see if your fake balance increases more than if you'd just held - remember to calculate initial  worth at final BTC price for comparison .

There is no way I could hide it from my SO. I'm pretty sure he's already sick of hearing the word bitcoin so many times a day. Although he was watching the TV today and flicked over to news and called to me excitedly, "hey that bitcoin thing is on the news!"

OK well according to [this site]( if you earn 30k in California you would pay $5921 income tax. 30k in USD is equal to $39k in AUD on which you would pay $4222 according to the ATO website calculator.

I'm both of those. I want to make money but also believe in the tech. I'm an ebay seller and if bitcoin could become accepted on there it would have a pretty cool impact.

I also see the high tax thing mentioned on reddit a lot. It's not true in my country either,  average income Australians pay less income tax than their American counterparts. I think this is probably  misinformation spread by the US powers to turn people off changing the health care system.

That's the same with stocks though?  You don't know if the company you're investing in has an edge or not until it either gains or loses.

I believe Bitcoin or blockchain tech in general is the future. Right now no one I routinely spend money with accepts crypto so I can't use it as everyday currency. But I'm holding for the day I can use it to buy my groceries, pay my mortgage or utility bills etc. Hopefully when that happens the amount I have held will be worth more than I put in but if not I'd be happy with equal value and full usability. I've also put some away for my kids to hopefully give them a headstart because I do believe crypto will be mainstream when they are adults.
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:29:51
Well obviously, what kind of value would it have if it were unlimited.

No I'm Australian. The issue isn't being sued, it's compromising the proceedings. The issue exists in Europe too. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:22:49
I agree. I have a fair amount in crypto now but never more than I'd be ok losing completely. That's not to say I'd be happy about it, there'd be some disappointment sure, but at the end of the day I could walk away from crypto with $0 and go on with my life just fine.
@_date: 2018-04-28 04:48:59
Yeah I subbed r/btc because I thought it was another bitcoin sub like this one but it's all bitcoin cash stuff. It's confusing and I felt misled which makes me wary so I don't think I will buy any bch.
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:43:19
Thats what I'm saying is not true, in my experience. You can also see that the number of new wallets is still steadily rising. Now granted they don't all represent new users but some do. If there were a dramatic drop in the amount people entering crypto, you'd expect the rate of increase in wallets to also drop.

This isn't true, in my experience. I'm just a boring mid 30s soccer mum. Though I have an IT background I'm no tech whiz. A lot of my 'mum friends' are asking me about crypto now. I know 2 who have since bought some. Regular people are getting involved and I think we'll see more and more mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:08:55
I don't advise them either way. I just explain blockchain tech to them the best I can and tell them how buying it works and about wallets. I leave their investment decisions up to them in the end.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:04:07
I understood what you said and I still don't think it's wise. You're involved, he's possibly involved. You publicly airing your opinion about his involvement may compromise any future proceedings. I'm surprised your legal counsel would not advise you against this.
@_date: 2018-12-17 02:56:42
I also think the thing between BTC and BCH had a lot to do with it.
