How will the next recession affect bitcoin in the immediate short term once news spreads panic?

It’s relevant today. LBJ amplified American aggression and the CIA was left in tact. The Cold War perhaps lasted longer than it should have. Regardless it was the flashpoint for cultural revolution in America during that time. Domestic and foreign policy changed dramatically, as did culture.

Malcom Wallace’s fingerprint was found in the Texas Schoolbook Depository on a cardboard box in the snipers nest. A lot of people were involved.

I think this coming recession crypto will see an immediate dip, but it will find its baseline support faster than expected. Then people will start buying.

I'm waiting until after initial panic sets in. People will pull out assets to cover losses, but crypto will stabilize minus all vaporware.

well maybe it’s not pleasant to sift through the same stuff

I can’t see a bullish price divergence anytime soon. There is little hype and a looming recession. People will sell assets to cover losses. It’s not 2017. But go ahead, hype wildly.

It just started to dip after a lackluster response to new markets. We don’t have new money flooding in and it won’t start coming in until after the next recession is official.

Why do you people keep rephrasing the same shit to convince yourselves you didn’t buy too high? This is not 2017. We are not in the midst of a bull market, and we have a looming recession up ahead. Where is the volume necessary to usher in a 15k+ btc market? A good deal is not buying before it’s price dumps.
