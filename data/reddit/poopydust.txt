Western companies and manufacturers can get fined by usa and get their bank accounts frozen for doing business with Iran. Its not only bitcoin atms, its almost everything produced in eu and usa, including cars, electronics etc.
Its more likely that they couldn't buy it from a bitcoin atm manufacturer because they refused to sell it to them.

Ultra short rough summary of the interview:   
Man: " This is just a normal BTM device, which converts bitcoins into rials. We had to build it ourselves because we could not import such a machine due to the sanctions. Its the first BTM built in iran. The interface is in persian so everyeon can operate it. This is a usecase and we are currently negotiating with the government and waiting for the regulations to make it open to the public. The next step is to implement other cryptocurrencies to the machine."  
Girl: "Its the first BTM device that I ever saw, because I have bitcoins I could finally convert it into rials in less then 3 minutes. I hope that with this technology we can find a way around the economic sanctions."
