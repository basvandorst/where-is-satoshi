You'd have to forge the signature, too, which would be orders of magnitude harder than rewriting the blockchain from 2010

The technical incompatibility would be that both coins need to have either segwit activated or some other transaction malleability fix in place.

In response to this incident (I think), Satoshi Nakamoto made the wallet pre-generate change addresses so that they appear in backups before they are first used

It did - these are the same coins as in that transaction, the 424,242 was split into several 50,000 BTC outputs and then recombined (along with other outputs) into a 500,000 BTC output that was used in this transaction

This is Mt. Gox's proof-of-solvency - they put a lot of coins in one place so that everyone could see that they did have the money they claimed to have

Do you know what happened to donations to the bitcoin wiki from 2010-2012? Were they a part of mtgox's coins or were they kept separate or spent?

They mean because individual bitcoins can be destroyed, the total number in circulation will go further and further below 21m over time.

This is misleading. At least 61 blocks were discarded as a result of the incident. The offending transaction does not exist anywhere in the blockchain after the soft fork. The transaction itself wasn't just made invalid; the block containing it and every block built upon that one were too.

That's what a reorg is. At least 62 transactions did not reappear on the good chain, and deeply-confirmed otherwise valid payments were reduced to 0 confirmations and needed to be re-added to the good chain.
