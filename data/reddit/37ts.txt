Says the wannabe-criminal who destroys gpus bought with **real** money and that can't understand that bitcoin is a speculative asset that's not going to last because, in the end, if anything, it's alt-coins made by banks those that are going to be used by everybody on the planet because, "criminal bankers"(LOL !!! financial ignorance is a beast...) are used to take note of each and every single transaction since fraud/money laundering and criminal activity are a thing and you are held responsible if you don't give that information to the authorities, something that can't be done with bitcoins because it's all about fraud/scams/burglars/crooks and criminal activity and,either you like it or not,everybody on the planet has to pay taxes and a tax-record is mandatory,not for the sake of stupidity,but for the sake of the entire community...
But, yeah, if the radical-chic-thug-life-propaganda-easy-money-script-kiddo-way-of-life is what you really care about...
Keep it up! X)
P.s. : and by the way, at least the pocket doesn't vanish because of some hard-disk failure and/or data corruption...
