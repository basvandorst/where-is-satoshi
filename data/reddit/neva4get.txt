why is it an unstoppable force?


being very unpopular with the public at large at large sounds concerning for the future success of bitcoin.


Are you predicting most people in the Western world will be attempting to own some bitcoin in 6 months time?

You can get a used monaro for under $15k aud.

If bitcoin were really being adopted for that purpose, the price would have several more zeros behind it already.

locally (Australia) I can get 4% interest just on an online savings account, compounded monthly. You may not be able to get this interest where you are, but with a million dollars I imagine international banking becomes potentially viable.
This is actually the lowest interest rate in history, so likely it will rise over the coming decade. In the early 90's during the recession, you could get 18% on a bank deposit (inflation was running at 15% though...)
This is $40,741 per annum. Inflation is currently running at around 1-2%, so you have to reinvest around half this amount, if you wanted to avoid drawing down the capital. Tax is very low on this amount
My current expenses are much less than $10'000 per year, so it sounds like the good life. There's nothing wrong with drawing down a bit of capital over time when necessary, so you've got some leeway at your disposal.
And of course it would be stupid not to put some money in stocks and get a greater return.
Easily retire.

You have not seen anything first hand. No one is manipulating the market, unless they're intending to make massive losses in usd and bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:17:17
If that's your attitude, you would have sold at a much earlier price, and not have a bunch of bitcoins today.

Prior to the gfc,  2006, every bank in Australasia was offering 7-8% per annum on savings and term deposits, a few percent above inflation, because the banks were desperate for credit.

I know, I'm one of them.
But if 50% of the subscribers are USA origin and own bitcoin, even that's near 0.01% of the US population, it's safe to say more than one in 10000 people in the USA own a fraction of a bitcoin I think.

All those 'for now' arguments sound like a justification for bitcoin in a hypothetical futurr, but not now. All those 'for now' arguments could fail to eventuate and still be problems in the future.
You can't justify bitcoin as safe, sound, or practical, on the basis of those hypotheticals, and it is risky and volatile until those hypotheticals eventuate.
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:32:06
I think less than 0.1% of the U.S. population would own any bitcoin.
I was thinking it would be less than 0.01%, but this subreddit has more subscribers than that.

If bitcoin becomes financially significant, it's a threat to some powerful established interests. Multi-billion dollar companies with the ear of government won't ignore bitcoin when it's taking market share, as a non-traditional financial product a business like mtgox can easily be legislated out of existence. I think shutdown of exchanges as normal legally operating companies is certain internationally if bitcoin is successful.
Seizing assets is entirely speculative fantasy, I have no idea whether they would have the legal power to do this. If you were farsighted enough and wanted to destabilise bitcoin that's what you would do
I also have no idea whether the japanese government could act that quickly. If people have a weeks notice, they'll withdraw all their coins and there is no issue.
It's just a thought.

That's still an insane return on investment. I'm going to sell everything if bitcoin hits $666, the exact amount needed to net me $10k. They could (will?) go up a lot more, but $10k is a lot of money from almost nothing to me.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:00:38
I can confirm that I have seen many posts like this.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:33:48
I have been imagining it's inevitable the Japanese government will shut doen mtgox and seize their assets, and at that point a substantial percentage of all bitcoins will be wiped from existence

That's a very high proportion, higher than other subreddits in the 30s I'm subscribed to. What proportion of subscribers do you expect online?
