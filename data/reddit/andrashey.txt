If they were hacked or not is irrelevant. Why did they then remove the insurance information if they claim to be not responsible?

I'd like to have segwit after my account get transfered and verified. They said they're trying but nothing yet, Coinbase you should hire or aquire and A-level customer service/support company. This should be a priority considering the influx of customers right now. Feels like nothing is getting done over there...

I have a cool idea(at least I think it is) and want to know your opinion on it. I'm part of a family company that has grocery stores across my country of Slovenia. What if we start accepting bitcoin as a form of donation for our charity projects? I find donations are super easy with bitcoin and why not try and offer that to our customers - we might even acquire some new fans :) 
Also helping my friends just set-up a bitcoin wallet and then sending them some bitcoin would a great initiative for all of us. After you can show them how easy it is to use as donations or payment. Or just have them watch their value grow, everything is ok for those first baby steps.

Great segment on bitcoin by Fox. We'll find a way to figure out the fees, just give it some time. Meanwhile embrace promote bitcoin to your friends and family, make sure everyone holds a small piece.
