The SEC doesn't usually announce anything like this publicly. If the applying company doesn't release the letter, the only way to get it is by filing an FOIA request.

Huawei is a global corporation that employs over 170k people and builds communication networks and telephones used all over the world. The earn $60billion a year in revenue with almost $6billion in profit. Owners of Huawei stock own a fraction of the company and the profit they make each year.
Bitcoin doesn't build anything, produce value, or earn a profit. 
Check out Warren Buffet's stance on gold, it also applies to Bitcoin: 
I'm not suggesting that investing in Bitcoin is stupid, it's just stupid to compare it to a company that produces value.

You can warn people as much as you want, but some people will still fall for scams like this. It's because they're greedy. I don't have much sympathy for these people.
One of my cousins has been falling for every MLM deal he comes across and losing money on them. For 15 years now. I gave up warning him a long time ago. He rationalizes his failures by saying he didn't get into the "business" early enough or he couldn't put as much effort into it as he wanted because of an illness or injury. He also blames his friends and family for not "supporting" him by buying his stupid over-priced scam shit. Every time someone suggests he should get a real job he freaks out and says he'll get rich by running his own business, but by "running his own business" he means paying $1500 to get into a pyramid/MLM scheme. He hasn't heard of OneCoin yet but I guarantee he'll join in when he does.

Only a very tiny minority of bitcoin enthusiasts really give a shit about the controversy. There's a small handful of people on each side who like to stir shit up and have nothing better to do with their time.
And most of the people making the biggest stink are folks who haven't contributed anything at all to bitcoin. Sometimes their biggest claim to fame is just getting a pile of bitcoins early on but have otherwise been toxic to the community.

That's not true, they definitely understand the limitations of technology. That's how you end up with laws like the DMCA, which make it illegal to circumvent DRM technology.
At a practical level, DRM folks understand that any DRM scheme can be bypassed, they just want to make it hard enough that the average person can't do it. The business folks can only justify spending money on DRM schemes if the amount of money they'll save from piracy is more.
The bar for bypassing hardware-based DRM on the last few years of phones and videogame consoles is high enough that only very few people end up jailbreaking/modding/pirating and the companies don't give a shit about those people. That's their goal and they achieved it.

That's the key here. I'd argue that very few people, even security-minded ones, properly secure their bitcoins. People make mistakes. How do you think the government got all of the bitcoins from Silk Road?
But really, what's the point of keeping your bitcoins if the government knows you have them and is willing to prosecute/imprison you for not turning them over? Is it worth being miserable and in prison for the rest of your life just to prove a point? You'd never even be able to use them because the government would see transactions from the wallet and come after you again.

I don't think you know what a hedge fund is or what Berkshire Hathaway is.
BRK is the opposite of a hedge fund - they invest in very non-risky, "sure thing" investments that they know will perform well over the long term. Hedge funds, by definition, invest in riskier assets with a lot of leverage and hope for huge gains in a short period of time.

The SEC doesn't directly control anything that's traded on exchanges. Their biggest mission is to enforce transparency to protect investors. The biggest sin in the eyes of the SEC is lying about something on a filing and you go to jail for that.
They have no interest or mandate to have any other forms of control of securities that are traded on exchanges.
Edit: Also, you're asking the wrong question. The SEC doesn't look for reasons TO approve something, they look for reasons to NOT approve something. If there are no reasons against it, it's approved. That's how laws in the US work in general. If it's not specifically illegal, it's legal.

You do realize that if you set up a Coinbase account to buy bitcoins for gambling they'll suspend your account, right?
The reason it's hard to set up these accounts in the first place is US law that says they need to know your identity.
Once you have the accounts set up it's super easy to buy bitcoin instantly, but if you try using them to do something illegal (or just against the ToS), they have ways of knowing and will just suspend your account.
"But wait," you say... "isn't bitcoin anonymous?" Nope, it's pseudo-anonymous and there are companies out there that specialize in tracking bitcoin transactions and it's pretty easy to see when you're sending BTC to a gambling site's wallet.

Yep, breaking laws is always the go-to use for Bitcoin.

Coinbase has millions of customers that use their services with no problem at all. Nobody posts here talking about the good experiences they have with CB, only the bad ones. That's why you think "most people" have a bad experience.
And the people who do have a bad experience are usually doing something to violate the terms of service and have issues with support not fully explaining what they did wrong. If all you're doing is buying and selling bitcoin with CB, there's no problem. You will run into problems when you do something stupid like transfer BTC gambling winnings into CB.

Did you bother reading anything at all about it?
First of all, it's 0.01 BTC buy-in, not 0.001. But that "investment" gets you nothing. You have to "recruit" 5 other people to earn anything. And to recruit more, you have to pay a higher fee. But it's not just a one-time fee, it's a monthly "subscription".
None of this has anything at all to do with bitcoin, they're just using that as the currency to set up their pyramid scheme.

What good is a currency that's illegal to use? The only thing it would be useful for is buying contraband on the black market, which is already illegal. Using bitcoin would just add to the illegality over just using straight cash.

Well, the blockchain will survive. It's basically just a big list of numbers. You could print it out and type it back in and have the same blockchain that'll work with the same software.
The real question is if bitcoin will be useful as a store of value or as a payment system. In the case of infrastructure collapse, I'd say no - bitcoin needs the internet (or some other network) to work. It's a peer-to-peer system. You can't use it if you're not collected to the network of peers.
What good is having a lot of bitcoin to a prepper if they have no way to connect to the bitcoin network to spend them?

Merchants usually charge the same for cash as CC, except at some liquor stores, at least where I live. And places I've seen that accept BTC charge an even higher fee in the form of a higher-than-market conversion rate.
In fact, I actually end up paying less than cash price when I use a CC thanks to cash-back rewards of 2%.


That's kind of irrelevant if you're using a CC as a replacement for cash and have never paid a fee or interest payment.


Nope, it's the merchants, except for irresponsible credit card users who actually pay interest on their purchases.
@_date: 2017-01-23 13:29:16
A lot of people don't seem to understand that. What good is a currency that's not legal to use for trade? No legitimate businesses would accept it, so you're left with only being able to use it to buy things that are already illegal. And bitcoin doesn't offer much that cash can't already do in that situation, except it allows for online transactions.
So basically it would only be useful for buying illegal shit online, with the bonus of adding another illegal act (using bitcoin) to your charges when you get busted.
Besides that, if the government is actively trying to bust people for using bitcoin, there are tons of ways to analyze the blockchain to reduce anonymity and track transactions. Plus if you get raided and they find a bitcoin wallet on your computer, they'll have incontrovertible cryptographic proof that you made certain transactions. The risks just wouldn't be worth it.
But the idea of a large government "banning bitcoin" in this way is pretty ridiculous.

It's pretty unreasonable to store emergency funds as bitcoin or expect that you can convert them to cash-in-hand on a fixed timeline. At least you learned a valuable life lesson.
I don't think Coinbase should make promises about when money will arrive in your checking account since they don't have any control there. I've had bank transfers sitting in limbo for over a week. The more money it is, the longer it takes.

I don't think the author understands how insurance companies work.
You aren't going to find an insurance underwriter willing to just lock up their claim reserves float in the blockchain.
Insurance companies make money by investing the float, or the money that they're holding to pay claims (and money they get from premiums...). With the author's strategy, they won't be able to earn money from the float since it'll be locked up and reserved for each client's potential claim. Their only profit will come from premiums, which means the premiums will have to be much higher than traditional insurance policies.
Being able to invest the float is what keeps insurance policies "cheap".
