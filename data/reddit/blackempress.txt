It is upsetting a known scammer can vote on board members and that psuedonyms are allowed which could let people obtain more votes and control the board.

Incredibly inaccurate, there are many great news agencies, software projects and more ran on donations from supporters.

Are you suggesting, I'm faking all of this? And for what ends? There are several others who reported he is a known scammer and I should have known better.

Does buying their way in mean they get to vote?

I have reported him/her to localbitocins but they were not interested because it didn't technically happen on localbitcoins. I got their contact info on localbitcoins before it went down.

You don't like all the food we produce, the entertainment, the oil, the technology? I bet you eat our food, watch our shows, and use our technology on almost a daily basis. The rest of the country is still functioning because we supply them with our tax dollars. We give out more tax dollars than we get back because you guys keep electing people who have no desire to improve government but only seek to destroy it for short term corporate profit. 
Gavin Newsom is a great politician who actually cares about improving our government, making it more efficient through technology instead of attempting to to destroy it. If you weren't such a child you would realize that the government has a purpose, there are many things that the free market is not equipped to handle effectively. We need it to provide protection for our basic rights, roads, sidewalks, schools and farm assistance and research that is simply not profitable.

People who think that 1k to 400 is dead are insane. A year ago we were below 100. A lot of us got in at less than 10 dollars. People can laugh all they want, but they simply have no perpsective. :)

I will in the future, but this person is obviously a scammer as pointed out by others and I want people to avoid doing business with known scammers. As they hurt the entire community.

Unfortunately I did, it was down at the time and I needed to do a trade. I will never do a trade without escrow again but I also want to make people aware this user is a scammer.

2 bitcoins were sent to this address. I can also provide the entire email conversation. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 22:25:54
I agree and I have learned from my mistakes and hope to spread good information to the community to make future transactions go smoother. I think we should reward good actors and punish bad actors within our own community. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 10:31:58
Thanks for verifying, I want to make it more well known this user is a scammer so people avoid doing business with them.
@_date: 2014-06-22 10:31:07
And then you will do what?  The coins were sent to this address. 
I can provide the email conversation if you really want it.
@_date: 2014-06-22 14:45:56
Unfortunately I do not follow the scam section, I think I will make sure to browse it before making any other transactions with users on localbitcoins.

No its like a scamcoin black hole. Since it doesn't need to mine because its POS, it can dominate other POW scamcoins by slowly mining their coins and selling them for blackcoins. Since the amount of blackcoins will likley drop since 1% won't be enough to cover lost coins they will gain in value causing more people to join in on the pools. 
Its a positive feedback loop.

You seem to be auguring very different topic then I was addressing.
My mention of roads to to explain how there are certain services that it would be best for government to provide so they are free for everyone. Obviously they could be better but there are so many wealthy people including google and apple who avoid paying taxes. 
We are ranked low but also have top class Universities that are constantly being cut. If we weren't paying out more in taxes to other states to keep their governments functioning we could probably have even better and cheaper schools, so people criticizing California from other states are being absurd. 
Security was not what I said at all, again I was illustrating the need for government services to a libertarian. You are completely missing my point. 
Non profit research can not be completely done based on donations, and there is a lot more research that really needs to be done using tax money because people don't realize it is important or corporations actively try to suppress it. 
Your point about farms shows how little you know about agriculture, if you are getting facts from signs put up by conservatives on the side of the road you don't understand the subtleties of what is happening in the central valley. And those farms would have a hard time functioning without cooperative extensions paid with tax dollars to help farmers save water battle pests and improve yields. 
You completely missed the point of my post and just went off on a tangent. Try re-reading the first two post then maybe you can actually participate in the discussion at hand.
@_date: 2014-06-22 07:43:18
Yeah, I knew it was a bad idea when I did it but I assumed they cared about their reputation. Always use escrow even if the person does a lot to make themselves seem legitimate.
I don't care if I get my money back at this point, I just want people to avoid this person on localbitcoins and hurt their sales to show you can't just scam the community with no consequences. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 20:20:10
I don't see how that is a cogent argument. Maybe try thinking about it more before typing a response? 
Also the statement "it isn't seeing ANY adoption" is patently untrue. Why are you denying the reality of the situation? It makes it hard to have an intelligent and honest discussion on the matter. Price isn't necessarily related to adoption too.
@_date: 2014-06-22 10:51:48
Yeah, you are correct. Once I did a google search I found a few threads about scamming and pretty much knew my coins were lost. But I want to make his reputation more public with this thread so others avoid a similar fate.
