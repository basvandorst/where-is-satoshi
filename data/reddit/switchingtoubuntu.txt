Made up my mind? Lmao. You make fast and wrong assumptions.
Good job ;)
@_date: 2014-06-01 20:05:21
Deposit it via...?
Credit card? Or wut.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:46:23
I see. I've actually never heard of OKpay. I'll look that up.
I'll look up localbitcoin too.
@_date: 2014-05-24 21:17:25
Hey shitbag, I know enough to ask for the little details I don't, and this is what I'm doing by posting here.
I'd like to thank you and your fellow cunts for showing me how awful the bitcoin community is!
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:59:44
Actually, that was not the same Pandacoin.
This pandacoin (PND), was named so for the purpose, specifically, of killing Wolong's Pandacoin. 
PND was the anti-Wolong, and thankfully they succeeded :)
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:38:23
Alright, why?
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:20:27
It's actually like going over to and asking what makes one team better than another, and why the lakers are good.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:55:24
Those sale prices seem about 8% too high.
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:38:49
You're telling me that buying bitcoin is not an investment? What would you call it?
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:54:07
Do you really think I'm going to bother to cash 1 satoshi?
@_date: 2014-05-24 23:03:26
I wanted opinions painted by association of bitcoin specifically, hence I posted here. I know what I'm doing lmao.
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:28:26
Wolong's was PANDA. This one, PND, was created to dissuade users from investing in the obvious scam, and safeguard their money. After Wolong fled cryptos, PND switched to PoS, and then began developments to improve the infrastructure of the coin and the overall quality of the currency.
At this point in time, they are pushing to develop a coin that objectively is better than literally all others. I guess we'll see how it goes :)
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:29:25
The question I actually asked, though, is, should I treat bitcoin just like I'm treating dogecoin, and just throw a few bucks into it that I wouldn't feel much if I lost?
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:27:57
Did I say that, shit-for-brains?
I said it will increase. As in, to like .55 or .60, which is a good 60% to 80% profit from when I bought, because I bought at rock bottom.
Lesson: You're a dickhead.
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:50:02
Lolz. Delivery. That's funny.
@_date: 2014-05-27 02:43:19
I don't care if someone doesn't have an answer. I care that they posted 2 or 3 words pretending to know something, instead of actually talking about the real pros and cons of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:57:34
I'm fine with that.
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:55:30
I feel like researching new technologies and investing in tech stocks would probably be better investments overall...
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:01:16
Lol. You are a cancer.
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:57:28
I already know some of the differences. 
My question is actually quite intelligent, as I already have most of the background information.
So, in short, go fuck yourself, you pompous fuck.
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:36:30
Do you *REALLY* think a bitcoin will be worth 10,000 dollars? Lmao...
@_date: 2014-05-24 22:59:52
Why, because you like to make wrong assumptions, I should have posted somewhere else?
I think your logic is funny.
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:50:37
You're a thief. You're opinion is no longer valid. /Ad hominim.
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:26:25
Pointless response.
@_date: 2014-05-24 22:38:00
Did I complain?
He's advertising for blackcoin in a bitcoin thread, and I didn't as him what makes BLACKCOIN the best, I asked him what makes a good coin. He specified in a way that is clearly "selling" his own product.
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:38:26
Pandacoin (PND) is a coin that currently has a sizeable development group that has a rather large roadmap for present and future developments. If you want to know more about PND's history, just ask.
These links might help too:
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:24:37
Um... cept the value of the coin was roughly .37 when I bought, and now it's .41, and has been hovering around .46 for the last few days, and is projected to increase once the twitch.tv tipping system is out.
You really ARE just cancer.
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:38:52
Which isnt so dumb :p
@_date: 2014-05-25 06:23:49
Pretty funny that everyone seems to be talking about fighting and censorship and ostracization, but no one in the community actually feels that any of this is happening.
;) To the moon.
@_date: 2014-05-24 21:47:23
Thank you for the high quality response. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:45:35
You realize that the word "investment" and the word "speculation" are not mutually exclusive? We, as a country, speculate on stocks constantly, and yet it's still "investing".
English is hard.
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:20:11
What do you mean play ball by someone else rules...?
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:19:03
I don't really care about the anonymity, I care about my bank information possibly being released in such a way as to cause me financial hardship.
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:20:58
Actually it's up from when I bought. So I guess you're just a judgmental dick.
@_date: 2014-05-25 07:35:17
Why :(
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:43:14
Ah, "we". Advertising for yourself I see.
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:16:33
mmm coffee
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:04:26
Help? By giving me 1 satoshi?  He's just being a sarcastic litte shit.
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:17:40
Prelude (the exchange), says it requires 3 confirmations before recognizing a deposit. What does that mean?
@_date: 2014-05-27 00:31:44
@_date: 2014-05-24 19:51:43
It's more like purchasing a penny stock, or some other non-blue-chip stock.
Makes sense.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:54:15
That involves a bank account, no?
