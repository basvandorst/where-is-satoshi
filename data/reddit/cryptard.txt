Can't speak for others here, but I'm a bit of a vape addict myself... Just the other day I was driving in my van (tinted windows) and the urge to vape just seemed to creep up on me out of nowhere. I pulled over near the local community college, did the deed, and continued on my way.
However, to be perfectly honest, I'm a bit of a closet vaper. I'm not sure what my parents would think if they knew I did a lot of vaping in my free time. Would they accept it, or ostracize me and tell me to get help and stop vaping? 
Either way, thanks for fulfilling the need to occasionally vape.

Colored coins; sidechain. Major issue here is once your currency is reliant on bitcoin's blockchain, that currency is influenced by bitcoin (price, min/tx fees, dies if it dies). There's no advantage since it's basically just adding a layer of obscurity.
@_date: 2014-09-28 22:01:58
I don't own any coins. I agree a lot of altcoins are pump and dumps, but some actually attempt their hand at innovation. I also think it's important for people to realize cryptocurrency doesn't start and end at bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:10:19
Do you understand the process that would be necessary to have BTC insured? It's a third party, likely with regulations. At that point there's hardly any reason left to use cryptocurrency. Use your brain.
@_date: 2014-10-06 11:18:14
Either you trust the entire ledger or you don't, I don't see the issue here. There's no reason multiple ledgers can't coexist and be secured - there's already proof of this. Furthermore, **you** own your private keys, not the ledger. You can authenticate your signature on *any* data; it's not ledger-specific.

If people want a cryptocurrency when/if fiat fails, there are enough reasons to be skeptical that bitcoin will be the option people run to. Bitcoin is abysmally distributed, and we're talking about open sourced software.

It's not good for remittance - volatility with exclusive use, higher fees/wait time in and out of exchanges.
It will likely never change since its value is pegged on pure emotion and speculation.

@_date: 2014-03-23 16:35:42
No. Physical usage is terrible and its advantages dwindle when you incorporate third parties - which, regardless of what the sheltered individuals here believe, is inevitable for a currency.
If it's an underdeveloped country they're going to want physical exchange, and if it's a developed country they're going to want insurance/escrow like modern creditors.
Even still, "starting over" would likely happen on a new/different cryptocurrency than bitcoin - if the technology genuinely works and holds value, why would they choose bitcoin instead of making their own?

Ooo altcoins are now analogous to other precious metals? Careful with that type of thinking 'round these parts.
@_date: 2014-10-04 06:57:03
That "feedback loop" theory is complete bullshit for bitcoin. Hardware investment directly correlates to how profitable mining is, nothing else. If anything, miners want less hashrate on the network so the difficulty lowers and their hardware becomes more efficient by gaining more of the network. Note: bitcoin's network hashrate is starting to decrease with the price.
I used wikipedia as its information is valuable. They raise 50 million annually in donations just to prevent any kind of sponsor or endorsement that could lead to biased articles. If people value the information enough, it can be secured with Bitcoin technology. If it's not valued enough, it doesn't deserve to be preserved. Plain and simple.

You aren't bypassing fees with bitcoin.
1) You use third party services in and out of the bitcoin ecosystem - you hit more fees than conventional methods.
2) Both the sender and receiver work exclusively in bitcoin and are subject to the ridiculous volatility.
3) Most important, tx fees will eventually need to support the entire network. 
Also, you have a strange definition of efficient.
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:19:39
So attempting to solve problems that banks have handled for decades. I question why anyone would use bitcoin if they want insurance - you're incorporating a centralized third party. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 21:14:01
What makes bitcoin more efficient in the future? The eventual decoupling between network security and providing incentive to mine is a known flaw with bitcoin. Bitcoin's network is secured by being wasteful, and when being wasteful isn't profitable bitcoin will have security issues. Construing this flaw as a positive is silly.
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:42:31

The lack of self-awareness is incredible with some bitcoiners. You need only ask why people like to tease and make fun of people from and you'll understand how irrational communities, like attract trolls.
The technology is far from perfect, and bitcoin is not an absolution for cryptocurrency. Advertising it otherwise, while dismissing criticisms as nothing but shills and trolls, kills your community and the product you're trying to pitch on newcomers more than any "bankster" conspiracy you can conjure up.

It's easy to understand since there's financial investment and ideologies pinned on the back of bitcoin being successful. However, that's no excuse for being an irrational and paranoid community. Ultimately, a lot of you guys are just shooting yourselves in the foot.

If the denomination retains value and there's enough distributed hashing power, clearly there is trust in said chain. If you're talking longterm, bitcoin is susceptible to a lot of the same criticisms you could raise here.
Regardless, there's nothing proprietary or exclusive to bitcoin's block chain. Any layering service on top of bitcoin can still be referenced from an external ledger, as well as obviously being layered on other chains.
@_date: 2014-09-29 01:27:17
It's just *simply* preventing theft? The libertarians here could argue it's stripping the freedom of taking advantage of the gullible.

The problem is the implementation of the currency on bitcoin's end. It has a pyramid structure which is going to discourage new users. It's designed around giving incentive to early adopters instead of promoting new users; bitcoin is insecure about itself from the start.
Give me a coin that I can reliably burn energy to consistently make, remove arbitrary caps that attempt to *force* value, and allow advancements in hardware efficiency to dictate inflation. People will use it, adopt it, and spend far less time trying to play wall street with it. It's the eventual future of cryptocurrency and the inevitable death of bitcoin.

People around here keep using the word "scarce", but it's not. Anyone can start a coin, with any implementation. Bitcoin will always carry the brand name of being the first, but, as more altcoins enter the market, its "value" will bleed out into other coins.
There's really nothing bitcoin offers that established altcoins can't replicate - they're *all* volatile, and cryptocurrency's main attraction is not *being able to buy shit at overstock in a different currency.*

When someone believes the currency will succeed in this self-entitlement, you end up with the "cheap coins" and "true believer" chants to rally encouragement of more investment (typically for reassurance), and the "guaranteed" rebound that is supposedly all but eventual.
"You should only invest what you can afford to lose" card only gets played when people post about their losses, which, to your credit, has been pretty god damn often throughout this year.

In other words: inflation and divestment.
What the OP is suggesting is true and falls under the latter category. People are using vendors that accept bitpay as an out. If they're not rebuying their coins, the volume is obviously going to have a negative impact on price. Vendors don't want bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-11 03:33:06

Your "acceptance" is companies that have been willing to implement an API that takes care of dumping your tokens so they can get their fiat. I don't know how much more clear it can get - no one wants bitcoin, because there's currently no point. 
You list a whole bunch of baseless hypothetical bullshit about recreating things people already have. Until there's an actual utility usage that can encourage people to go through the hassle of signing up at an exchange, the bleeding will continue. 
Also, halving doesn't magically appreciate your coins. It's the ticking time bomb that your community has to convince people that they actually need your coin for something. Block halves, price remains, miners leave, and difficulty adjusts. Inflation may lower, but so does security. The network also becomes even more central than it already is.

I wouldn't use "love" to describe cryptocurrency. It's free and it's ruthless, and separation from governments is a two-way street.

Not a very strong argument there. 
Most of your software related arguments are pointless since we're talking about open sourced software. All previous development costs, efforts, and struggles to solve bugs on the protocol are inherently free to future forks (or simply available for reference). Same goes with most wallet software.
VCs aren't investing in companies that are exclusive to bitcoin; they're reliant on cryptocurrencies, but agnostic towards protocol specifics. Layered investments that rely specifically on bitcoin don't exist yet (and never may).
"Any competitor will be steamrolled and forced to use existing bitcoin's balances" - I'm not even sure how to respond to this. It's obviously not a competitor if the network can't sustain itself from angst users. Bitcoin's userbase is practically nonexistent relative to world population. SHA256 ASICs likely won't be compatible on a competing network.
Biggest threats on bitcoin:
Slow implementation of competitor features. Both at the development end (bitcoin's core is grossly underfunded and under contributed to) and acceptance by consensus (lack of direction, conflict of interest).
Centralized hardware and mining pools. "Trust" on the network is questionable when a handful of entities make up the network. When specialized hardware makes average household devices worthless to the network, you're no longer decentralized.
Distribution. Arbitrary caps/halving attempts to appreciate coins. Only time will tell if bitcoin can provide enough leverage to justify **required** value increases that the network needs to secure itself. Speculation only goes so far.
