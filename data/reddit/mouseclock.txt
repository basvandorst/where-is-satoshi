No need to troll with the same question over and over again.

The Bitcoin community is pushing decentralized p2p currencies as far foward as technology allows.  If you look at the platform technology innovations they are very far ahead of every other coin by years.....
The dogecoin is a great addition to the cryptocurrency community and they add a lot in terms of community.  Dogecoin has been alive for two months, while it feels like things are really moving fast.. and they are, I think it is still going to be at least a year before dogecoin starts adding truly innovative features to the cryptocoin technology base.  Even if Dogecoin does innovate; will it be clones of things already done or will they truly push the boundaries of what can be done with cryptocurrency?
So to directly answer your question; Bitcoin stands for the advancement of peer to peer distributed systems and the value they provide.

There is more at stake now for the bitcoin community.
Two years ago was just like dogecoin except they could only give bitcoin to each other

to expand on that bitcoin is pushing forward the ideals of atomic, unalterable transactions that allow for a decentralization of trust economy....

I think you are new to cryptocoins and are unable to understand common themes between the answers you have gotten.  There is a really nice subreddit at They will help you learn the basics.
