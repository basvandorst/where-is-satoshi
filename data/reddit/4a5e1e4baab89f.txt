It is merged into the master branch that means it will be included in the next release. Releases usually don't have ETAs.

So if Bob had opened the channel he could have set a very small amount of time for this value, couldn't he?
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:11:11
Should be ready in approx. 6 months

This means if there is a channel between Alice and Bob where only Alice has 1BTC in the channel, sends that to Bob and Bob sends that back to Alice, there is no incentive for Bob to behave in a good manner since trying to steal coins with an attack would result in no penalty for Bob at all since he initially did not have any funds, correct?

Centralization is about power being central to a minority group. Bitcoin Core could simply reject all these pull requests, which would be dumb obviously, but they could and are as such in central power of the Bitcoin Core code. The same is true for the bcash clients. 


Not a bcash fan, but you should really increase your search skills:

Can you do that? Just **not** broadcasting, that you are there as a node?

Interesting video, though my question is not addressed in this Q&amp;A, or did I miss something?
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:14:20
Okay, thanks for pointing that out!
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:42:30
Good to know, thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:05:09
GTFO with your logic ... /s
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:25:22


Thanks for clearing this up! 


But who sets the timespan of the timelock and when does that setting happen?

Sorry, I should've added the /s
There is a [famous tweet]( by one of the lightning network main devs Elizabeth Stark, saying, that LN is coming in the next six months - which was in Dec. 2015 though.


Anyway, thanks for your contribution as soon as you feel comfortable to run a LN node!

1) Yes, but what are they waiting for? Shouldn't it be the top priority as of now to make Bitcoin usable as a currency again?
2) Could you give me some reference where you get those 3-6 months from? I've read different numbers on multiple places and rather felt like "nobody knows".
3) Yes that is right, I should have made myself more clear, sorry: What are the tx fees expected to be when LN gets activated?
5) What do you mean by "no longer own any of those coins"? What is supposed to happen for the classic "I buy my coffee every morning on my way to work" situation? This is basically a one way channel from me to the coffee shop. I would not want to close it since I know I will use it each day. As far as I understood LN I would have to initially deposit a few BTC when opening the channel and can do transactions as long as my balance in this channel is positive and the other side did not close the channel.

Have a look at this comment: 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:49:28
God dammit Reddit. Where did all these self proclaimed Software Engineers come from? Who are you to declare a version prdocution ready that was actually tagged by the official developers as "release candidate"? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:04:28
How is that a proof that they are greed, and why should they not be greedy? Miners mine for profit
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:15:39
I am looking at the UTXO count which is down as well: 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:08:18
Yes but talking about larger blocks in here is a dangerous thing
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:43:26
That is better indeed. Though you can see that it's going down as well, or the output/transaction ratio is still the same.

Thank you! Sorry for the harsh tone but seeing how Bitcoin enthusiasts promote the LN software and encourage people to use it on mainnet while devs such as Elizabeth Stark strictly warns everyone and says herself that it is not ready for mainnet just makes me sad and angry. I feel bad for the LN devs since they get under indirect pressure with this. Stark herself gets attacked on Twitter by Bitcoin enthusiasts for saying that LN should not be used on mainnet.
There is nothing wrong with being excited about new releases and spreading the word about it, but people should respect the devs estimation of the softwares's state.

Since I'm not Korean: is that an official gov statement or just hearsay?
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:55:05
We always were my friend. We just found each other on Reddit
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:17:31
Unfortunately the number of transactions and the UTXO is down with the latest drop in value. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:44:11
Did you even read the article? Dash is the JS library used to implement mpd streaming
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:18:42
Is UTXO count a better metric (which is unfortunately down as well)? (
At which metric would you look?
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:44:31
Very interesting!
