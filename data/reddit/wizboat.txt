I mean, the calc could be done in a spreadsheet app, but if you do any sort of alg trading like me, it was far easier to pony up for cointracking (especialy since it handles lifo, lifo, etc...)
If one is found in this thread I'd also be interested in trying it out
@_date: 2018-09-20 12:17:03
I'd be more than happy to share details for anyone here to test out, but don't believe the mobile apps have the ability, thoughts?
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:01:41
Cool I didn't kbow anout that site, will give it a whirl

The point being, backend stability and functionality takes precedence over a user experience (and a lot of time to get right) just as I'm sure synthesizing new drugs does. User experience can always be enhanced later.

Ahh. Not sure if the ledger works with that type. I know coinbase can send to it.
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:53:18
Cool glad you got things rollin'
@_date: 2018-08-05 01:37:41
This one doesnt allow receiving if I'm not mistaken
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:30:40
Cool, will do. Trying to see if some co-workers will download as well
@_date: 2018-05-10 20:23:26
Should be up and ready ;)

Anyone wanna test? Payment request here
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:21:10
Thanks, I was getting the same error when trying to pay from Éclair wallet. When I went to the graph and tried connecting (to any of peers) it says "this peer doesn't have any addresses"
specifically when opening the lnd logs I do see "DNS: discovery failed on seed xxx: No address associated with hostname..."
@_date: 2018-05-29 05:10:28
Start here.
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:09:32

Ahh, was thinking that might be it and was in the process of sending testnet coins to fund it. Also, noticed I couldn't generate an invoice without specifying an amount (say for donations). Not sure if you have a portal/GitHub for issue reporting.

Hmm, not sure if I can do that with the mobile wallet. Bitcoin Lighrning Wallet (android) lets you export channel details but all it contains is the key. It uses olympus servers for various things so not sure if this would work?

would work?
@_date: 2018-06-30 16:21:15
Found this and seems to be exactly what I'm looking for
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:57:12
Oh really? Didnt know that's how it worked.
If anyone wants to do ^ I'd be happy

Was wondering about that too. Pasting a link with prime shows $0 shipping but not sure if that means prime was picked up, or the link was just parsed the best way it could.

Submarine swaps are in the works and will do what your wanting (search it in Reddit) until then you can use lightning conductor to send off chain (lightning) to on chain wallet. Additionally if someone opens a channel to you your receive limit will increase by the balance in their channel.
Please note right now your wallet (and any mobile wallet) can't have a channel opened to it because of the difficulties of dynamic ip addresses mobile phones constantly are getting from cell towers.
If someone sees something I've missed or said wrong please feel free to correct as I typed this out quick and have been drinking, urrp
