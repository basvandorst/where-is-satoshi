This is really cool man, installing it on my RPI right now. Thank you!
Edit: Is the drive formatting required?

Right? People are so childish. Don't get me wrong I'm all for the memes, but why negativly target them towards people who didn't do anything evil, just a "bad" decision?
Always with this "us VS them" mentality... Don't forget about the human on the other side of the screen

I think the power is what makes for most of the price and not the hardware? I never mined so I might be wrong.
I kinda see mining as a way to convert $$ into btc while helping the network, but without a lot of profits anymore

Would use it if the charts were black in dark mode!

Question: how much approximately would be the tax to sell $1M worth of bitcoins in the US?

I PANIC BECAUSE I CANT BUY 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:43:07
Ideally, I will stop holding when its value stabilizes and can be used to pay for everything like FIAT.
Realistically, I will probably sell if it reaches crazy amounts (in the orders of $200k/btc) and still can't use it to pay in the daily life

Well to be honest it is safer... That doesn't mean it's 100% safe tho.

I got .001 BTC on there. Where does this come from???
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:11:17
I feel great! I bought my first BTC at 4700, and they day after it was at 3500. I just removed the ticker widget from my phone and didn't check it for a while. The dip didn't go too down so I wasn't too worried, and look at it now!
