Really? The amount of times the phone verification does not work, or it asks me to recover my wallet is just dreadful. Trezor for the win, you don't have my issues?

I don't really understand why people would select a site like Bovada that will confirm your identity as soon as you try to cash out over sites like mbit casino. I am usually able to cash out instantly at mbit, but their sportsbook is under maintenance now

Shit, has it come to that? I bought my silver at $46 per ounce so seeing this is a nightmare.

I understand. Not everyone understands the ways of an outlaw.

Trust me, that's not correct. To India it doesn't work and other massive freelance countries like those.

My hope exactly, thanks!

Paypal's system doesn't work well enough to identify that.

Completely agree with you. There wasn't much of a point to post this entire story. There is never reward without risk, and OP is looking to consolidate his decision by getting support from the community.
I for one keep 90% of everything I own in bitcoin/alt coins, and I am quite comfortable with that. Others aren't, and will never be. The reasons for getting out of BTC is reaching your fear treshold many times, which is easy to reach if you repeat some mantras in your own head. 
Tell yourself how difficult money can be to get, and you start cherishing your gains more and more. Tell yourself how many things you could buy if you cashed out now, and you will want to do just that.
If you don't, and just keep riding the roller coaster without judging, knowing that there's an up- and downside, you can be quite comfortable. There are two types of people really, those that love comfort to some extent, and those that hodl.

Someone just posted this to my facebook, these are representatives of onecoin after finding negativity about their brand:
In no particular order, sorry.
