Guys, don't be too strict on Sweds. Every medal has two sides. Most probably at some point it was too much for them to deal with all the scams and complains related to Bitstamp, so they've decided to ban it.

There is no encryption in btc. It should be: cryptography we trust.
@_date: 2019-08-05 14:04:58
It is true and definitely makes a lot of sense from a macro-economics perspective. The only pb when btc will reache 100k, 100k will be worth a slice of pizza.
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:10:30
It is cargo cult.
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:51:52
"anonymous", "unbanked" This makes btc a perfect tool for criminals and corrupt officials. Don't you think?
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:22:37
For transactions over 10k they could also ask proof of source of funds (SOF)

AML feds are on their way.
@_date: 2019-08-05 11:47:18
I just don't wait for return of investments and see btc as a non-banking trade tool.
@_date: 2019-08-05 19:04:13
Oh, boy, "it will happen because I want it to happen"
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:25:14
There is no secret. we are "yet another crypto exchange" - team, trying to find a niche in crypto scene by creating a company which follows all the regulations of the fintech industry (at least in EU). Atm AML commissions kindly ask us about Fraud Detection/Prevention policies for both fiat/crypto.

The intelligence level of your comment is above all expectations.

I have never seen wedding ring made from bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:01:54
You bought something but didn't get it delivered. In case of regular payment one is able to ask authority for chargeback.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:41:25
You are right. Have missed the last email from trustee. So the X-day will come in 4 months. But it will come.

To be able to use bank services/accept cc any crypto-exchange must apply AML/KYC policies.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:38:35
I am also one and I remember the date form email from 20-th of March. But it could  also be  is right and it was postponed ...  again.

It's not about bitcoin being bad or good, it's more about people who worship btc like an idol.
@_date: 2019-08-05 18:49:43
Guys, sorry for destroying your naive perception of an objective reality, but could you pls give me a reason why it is good for bitcoin (not for you personally) to be 100k worth? (don't forget to take into consideration btc protocol limits)
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:52:36
Without KYC it is quite easy to ask bank for chargeback for "Service not delivered" reason and merchant will have no chance to proof he did. Actually this is the reason why PayPal rejects crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:22:25
What about cash? Do they accept VISA?
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:09:29
One in top right corner looks suspiciously similar to Vitalik Buterin. :)
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:34:11
Theoretically, they could block all on L3 and allow only authorized ones. So, it is unlikely but not impossible.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:05:48
Hm, it is actually 140k BTC and 140k BCH. Not sure if it will be "easily absorbed".
@_date: 2019-08-01 19:38:37
Thank you, we will need some luck for sure.
@_date: 2019-08-13 13:36:55
Exactly, somebody is always rewarded at the expense of others (those with less understanding but more inspiration).

In 2 months MtGox will start with payback, so  market will be over-flooded with coins.
@_date: 2019-08-21 15:46:47
The idea to implement an authority contradicts the vision of bitcoin, doesn't it?
@_date: 2019-08-05 10:55:16
I would rather prefer it stays at 10K for long term.  A currency with wild price movements is good only for speculative swing trading.
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:19:45
What is the pb for merchants to accept btc directly?
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:01:54
They cannot, but btc nw can, if there is a "fork" for instance.

I was able to recover mine with Electrum
