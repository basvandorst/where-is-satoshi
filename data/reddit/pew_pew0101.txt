Feel free to regulate whatever you like. it will have no effect.
BTC all ways seek to leave week hands and move to strong hands. You either understand the fundamentals or you don't.
BTC is a medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value.
Gold, silver, oil all commodities have market cycles.
BTC is a secure trustless value transfer system with a limited supply that can not be arbitrarily stopped or censored.
If you need these services BTC is for you.

BTC is not a credit system.
You can not issues IOU's and there is no 3rd part to offer you credit.
You cant fraudulently issues more btc then you own.
You can not take someone else's BTC without there permission.
You can not create fraudulent accounts to obfuscate your numbers.

a socially legitimate case is not a thing.
There are only individuals acting on individuals.
Bitcoin will not comply. 
Bitcoin has a natural tendency to move from those who do harm to those who do honest business. it is indifferent overall to anyone mans ends.
BITCOIN is a currency of individual conscience.

Your opinions about btc have nothing to do with the facts of the system.
you will not stop BTC.
you will not change BTC.
BTC will move along without you.
You really do not have much of a choice. Your governments create money out of thin air at the whim of a keystroke undermining your hard work to earn money.

Step 1. Take a breath (relax)
Step 2. Your wallet is probably locked up tight.
head over to blockchain.info and put your PUBLIC KEY in the search. you can see if the BTC has moved. also, the core wallet will show you if money has left your wallet in red.
Step 3. back up your wallet a few times (wallet.dat) in a few different places.
Step 4. Sign a message. it will prompt you for your encryption password.
Step 5. Try and recall your password
If all else fails you may need to contact a pass word recovery service to Brute force your wallet.

In economics, a durable good or a hard good is a good that does not quickly wear out, or more specifically, one that yields utility over time rather than being completely consumed in one use. Items like bricks could be considered perfectly durable goods because they should theoretically never wear out.
