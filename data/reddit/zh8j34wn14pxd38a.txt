Looks good in a lot of ways but fails on two of my checks:
- Ridiculous number of coins (84 million), why that huge number?
- Has proprietary SegWit / Lightning network which basically takes fees from the miners and gives it to the proprietary lightning network.

You've got a lot of shitcoins on there, some I've never even heard of. My investment rules for cryptocurrencies:
- No premining, everyone gets a fair shot at mining.
- Not owned or controlled by a company.
- No censorship of discussion.
- No founders fees or allocation for them or their foundation/organisation.
- No sidechains.
- No ridiculous number of coins e.g. no more than &gt; 21 million can ever exist (there was some good reasoning behind that number regarding splitting the coin into individual units and not overflowing ints)
- No developers or founders with ties to government or who might make secret side deals to deanonymise transactions *cough* zcash *cough*
- Bonus if there's privacy features.
- Bonus if it's impossible for ASIC mining to give everyone a fair shot at mining it.
After those rules that left only Monero. Though I haven't reviewed all of them yet. I also like Bitcoin Cash as it is closer to the original cryptocurrency vision.

Full node clients have no say in the matter. It's all controlled by the miners. Read the whitepaper. The only thing a full node client is good for is validating the blockchain for yourself.
