G-20s have a lot in their table, thanks to Trump, steel trade and US tariff, circumventing WTO rules, China trade tensions, ... etc etc,  some $320 Billion unorganized and unstructured crypto industry will not give them that much headache, May be some strong words on regulation. A bright week ahead for Crypto, What could go wrong?
@_date: 2018-03-13 06:52:07
It feels like that until it happens
@_date: 2018-03-14 06:19:41
I admit that I have a little bit of those signs you mentioned. Like, affecting productivity, neglecting your partner, not getting enough sleep ... Good time that I noticed. I will work  on it, Thank you so much, Salute!

BTC have tested to brake 11 500 couple of times in last 7 days (about 3 times), shows that, In my guess,  BTC will keep playing between 10200 to 11500 at least until the weekend. Then it might go as low as 9800 and hopefully it then will bounce next week. Given the current volume, sub 10000 is coming soon at least this weekend.
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:22:46
Wait about 4 to 6 hours from now

The G20 is set to hold two separate discussions on cryptocurrencies next week in an effort to seek what representatives call a "common response" on regulation.
A media representative for next week's summit, to be hosted by Argentina, which currently holds the G20 presidency, said that the first meeting will take place Monday. The talks will feature Argentina Treasury Minister Nicolás Dujovne and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Secretary-General José Angel Gurría, among other stakeholders.

@_date: 2018-03-24 14:57:15
You can also make the opposite argument using the same points

Sounds you are from Europe like me, so register Coinbase, and Use SEPA transfer and send money from your bank to Coinbase and then register GDX. (in case you don't know, Gdx is a website which is owned by coinbase) 
Then transfer your fiat from coinbase to Gdx, and watch some youtube videos about GDX. 
That's what I used.
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:23:51
I can smell it :)
@_date: 2018-03-08 11:10:36
Hard to guess as you can understand. Based on trends, Usually, It will go down on the weekends, and Fridays price and Mondays price are +/-1% to +/-5% ranges. Then again I could be wrong +/-1% to +/-5% 
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:31:21


Absolutely, the best advice!
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:09:34
My optimistic guess is 10 -12 K
Realistic guess is 8 - 10 K
Pessimistic guess is 4 - 6 K
Disclaimer - I have no idea what I am talking about, no reason, no logic whatsoever. I Wouldn't be here if I have something more important to do than farting numbers out of my keyboard.

@_date: 2018-03-17 09:48:38

Its like reading the New yorker or any other magazine from cover to cover for years and at some point down the road, you realize that the writing, the style, the content ... none of them click you any more, or even you conclude that you can write better than them or the text becomes tasteless for your hunger for knowledge. Then time to move on, find new horizon 
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:33:15
Looks like its coming soon! Oh, its almost here, 5K is on my mind :)
@_date: 2018-03-17 09:47:02
Blockchan will stay, BUT Bitcoin's future is (5 to 10 years from now) ... Nothing or Everything, 0 or 1, changing the world payment system for better or losing value. I don't think it will continue like this being speculative and volatile with out being main stream. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:45:02
Where are we going?
@_date: 2018-03-20 08:40:19

If you personally do not report to the Finland tax office, how do they know?  Does the tax office get info from exchange sites? do you have to attach some documents?
