I don't believe currency well even be a factor at that rate though.  If an event like that happens, I believe that the simple task of even finding food in the first place will be the biggest concern.  Yes, you may need to pay for food at some point, but I'm willing to bet you'll have to fight for food before that in this event. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:58:08
I think you have bigger problems in this event.  Idk, maybe like being able to find food to eat. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 03:18:42
I agree

There was a massive sell order at 10k.  Yes it takes people buying into the sell wall to surpass 10k but that particular order was selling.

Ok, I see what you're saying. I agree.

I don't think there will be a dump, but you at least have more than a one liner reason, and I respect that.  Plausible for sure.
