I lecture medical students. During the break, I have informally polled them to ask how many of them have ever heard of BTC. Still running less than 20%, but the ones who answer YES are often extremely passionate. The next years will be very interesting.
@_date: 2012-02-22 04:12:51
Why, yes! How come it doesn't show up for me on the main [page when I click NEW?

This will appeal to a lot of newbies and that's all that is expected. Nothing is universally appealing to everyone. Our goal is to enlighten people one at a time. This is good. Thanks so much for the strong effort.

TERRIBLE TERRIBLE customer service in my opinion. I opened an account and set up a deposit of US $. Followed the online instructions. Went to the local Bank of America to deposit the cash. So far so good.
When I didn't see the funds in my account, I clicked on the LIVE CHAT option.
The chat window opens and says I'm 4 in line. After 10 minutes, I'm 1 in line and the estimated time of being helped by a rep is 1 minute. Well, it stayed like that for 20 minutes. So I closed the window. I tried this at least 10 more times and each time, the same happened. I'm pretty convinced there is not live chat option and it just fools you into thinking that something is happening, because every time, it quickly gets you from starting out as  3 or 4 in the queue, but when it gets to  it just waits and waits and waits.
Emails have gone completely unanswered for 2 days now. I'll just wait. Hopefully, my money is not lost. In any case, they have a customer service system that leaves no way of contacting them. Not a good sign.
@_date: 2012-02-17 02:06:32
Customer service still as described previously, but they have at least solved the problem and the funds are in my account.

I posted a listing 10 hours ago, and it's not up yet. However, there is a new listing up that is only 30 minutes old. Hmmm.

What's cool is that you are using BTC to promote and make your medical practice more successful whereas I am utilizing my medical practice to promote and make BTC more successful, but yet we can both succeed. Best wishes! :)

I was contacted many weeks ago by ABC to allow them to come to my office and film parts of this. My nurses actually have more footage than the few sound bites that they used. As expected, they only used short selective segments. There's actually a lot more discussion of Ric interviewing me. They edited out a lot of content that speaks favorably of BTC. I'm debating if I should post the additional footage. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:16:06
Update: I did get the deposit exactly as promised on the date promised. I accept BTC in my business and I used Coinbase this time so I could cash out into my bank account.
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:06:29
I have my coins now or at least I think I do. (Now blockchain.org is down)

A 3D-printer takes a blueprint and follows the code to manipulate materials into making a product. In essence, nature does the same to take information encoded in DNA and manipulates amino acids to form proteins that end up resulting in a living organism. How long before this can all be done in a controlled fashion medically? My guess is 200 years or more, but based on the progress being made every day, it might be faster than that. Right now, we can't synthesize a working germ cell (sperm or egg) from scratch, but we can take an existing sperm and egg and make it into an embryo which can live outside the body for up to 6 days. But then we have to put it back into a healthy uterus in order for it to grow the rest of the 9 months or so.

I'll be there. Giving a talk Saturday on Medicine and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-12 05:15:26
They told me (in a generic to all speakers) that the talks will be recorded. Not sure yet what they will do. For my talk, the slides alone without the supporting transcript will probably not mean much. Are you in the medical field?
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:03:41
Do you find IVF hard to believe or just the fact that they paid with BTC?
@_date: 2013-03-02 18:22:39
Or you could take the extra step of sending 0.1 BTC as a test.

By the way, in case you don't already know, here's the [link](

Dr. Lee here. Just to clarify, BTC acceptance is a standard policy at my medical center and has been such for over a year now. Off the top of my head, I think we've completed 20+ successful transactions already. At present, patients are getting a 10% discount if paying with BTC. But let's not compete against each other. As fellow physicians, let's both work together to further the cause in giving our patients the best options. Good luck. Let me know if you have any questions.
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:08:51
UPDATE: During the night, Blockchain.org sent me a message that the coins from Coinbase have arrived. I'm assuming it's all good now. Unfortunately, I can't check for sure right this second because blockchain is now temporarily down.
@_date: 2013-03-22 04:14:44
In all fairness, when I submitted a support ticket, they responded with an email acknowledging that they're working on the problem. I'm wondering if there will be some sort of appropriate compensation for the time lost not having access to our BTC. In my specific case, the BTC were already in my Coinbase account, but when I attempted to transfer them two days ago, it just generated a pending message which has been the status for two days now.
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:46:59
By the way. The actual email from Fred was received Mar **20** 2013 | 8:56 PM, but it says Mar 21. Not sure what the significance of that is.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:33:26
Maybe I'm not being clear. I support you 100%, my friend. It's a great move that you are making and I want to encourage you. In fact, I've been doing all I can to encourage other businesses, especially fellow doctors to embrace BTC and I know it's just a matter of time. Keep it up and let me know if you have any questions. When you do your first real transaction soon, it will be so exciting. You'll see. :)

Flash from the past:
As an MD, last year, I experimented with accepting BTC for [medical services]( and I got one taker!
I recently had to readjust the price, from the original 15 BTC down to 1 BTC, because the 15 BTC that I earned back then are worth over $600 today.
@_date: 2013-06-10 13:46:22
How about [this](
I certainly support smart safe donation practices and am happy to provide any other verification you can suggest.
More importantly than the BTC, I think a thank-you-message would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:36:36
Those parents had a lot of fun with the initial attention and are now focusing on the time-consuming joys of raising children. There have been other babies since then and we are always trying to support the BTC cause.
@_date: 2013-06-10 13:24:38
Hey BTC Community:
I am the physician who performed the medical procedure that led to this. This couple donated their privacy to allow permission to publicly show this photo of their baby. They asked nothing for it in return, but said if it will help people, then they would be glad to do it. Assisting in the spread of BTC adoption and empowering the common person to transact freely certainly counts as helping people.
I saw the comment below about a trustfund. That would be awesome, but realistically, if you would like to give a tiny bit (.01 BTC?) towards a gift card for this brave couple, I'll be happy to coordinate it. Perhaps I'll use gyft.com to do it and share this tale with the CNN reporter who interviewed me for this news story in case she wants to do a follow-up. I'll keep it transparent and report back when it's done. Don't worry if you can't give. You can still support by adding a comment below with a "thank you" to the couple. I'll collect them all and send them a card. Thanks!
Here's [proof](
And here's a [link]( to track the progress
UPDATE AUG 1 2013: Thank you all for your kind gestures. A total of 1.2 BTC were raised, but when I went back to the parents of the baby, they replied that they were very grateful for gifts, but they decided for the sake of the baby's privacy they preferred to stop at the point they have reached so far without any further publicity for their child. This is certainly understandable.
Two weeks ago, I sent private messages to all those who have donated asking for an address to which I can return their donation. Many of them requested that I think of other ways to spread the good news about BTC and use the donations for that purpose, while others have provided me with an address. I'm still waiting for a few more people to have a chance to reply. Soon, I will process the returns. In the past few months, I have given a talk on BTC that is viewable on YouTube, I have been on CNN, local Los Angeles ABC news and have been called by many reporters to give statements. I am happy to have done my part to further the cause, and I'm ready to take a break and work on other life projects. Thanks for all your encouragement.

I was one of the speakers and I'm in email contact with Lindsay Holland, the main coordinator.
They are in the process of getting the videos ready for release and synchronizing with the slides, so it won't be like someone taking their phone to the movie theater and filming the screen. The next step is to show them to us (the speakers) for our final approval / edits. I don't know the exact timeline, but she suggested they would be uploaded early next week and then await feedback from the speakers / presenters.
@_date: 2013-05-13 21:31:50
I have suggested to the organizers that they amend the website to announce that videos of the conference will be available after the event. Here is the updated [link](

My sending of BTC from CoinBase to my wallet was delayed 2 days. Now 100% resolved.
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:44:33
Just adding my experience. I requested a withdrawal on the 19th. They sent me an email in reply to my submitted support ticket:
Subject: BTC already in my account. Delay in them being sent.

Hi, Sorry about that! We were doing performance improvements that caused some temporary delays (posted in the status updates section here:  and we are still working to regenerate some transactions that went unverified. You can expect a resolution in the next 24 hours if not sooner should your transaction still show "pending" or your balance not refreshing. Again, sorry for any undue stress caused!

This is what I see in my transaction history:

I just got back home. I concur. It was amazing. Met some really smart people. Had lots of fun.
This is a rumor I heard. I don't have a source, but it seems about right. Supposedly, they expected about 400 people but it wound up being about 1500. Anybody else have better-verified sources? It seems about right to me.
