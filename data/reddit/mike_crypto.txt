I tried blockchair. But it looks too overloaded with data and not that user-friendly

Speaking of BIP173 adoption - there are not many services yet that support Segwit adoption and allow to work with bech32 addresses.
[Bitupper.com]( has launched its Block Explorer with BIP173 adoption support - Bitcoin and Litecoin are supported.

Soon support for DOGE will be added, and later - even more coins.
Bitupper Explorer 10 advantages:
1. Full SegWit support (bech32 addresses)
2. Multi-language support - English, Russian, Spanish (+3 languages in November)
3. Multi-currency support (BTC and LTC - ready, DOGE - in 2 months)
4. Fast response - around 2x faster than most of the explorers (more improvements under way)
5. Clean and user-friendly design
6. Advanced features such as filters, reports, alerts
7. Advanced search with various criterias
8. Asynchronous structure providing no downtime
9. Best database engineering with most detailed blockchain data

Look at the address, they have some history there, just kept using an old address. Not many people are using wallets with Segwit support. I guess, it was made just for convenience of supporters. I think they can add Segwit address for donation with no problem.
Steve Jobs may also have used some other devices before he introduced an iPhone. Don't see an issue there,  u/swimfan229

Sure, I get your point. Quite fair. Segwit address for donation will be added soon
