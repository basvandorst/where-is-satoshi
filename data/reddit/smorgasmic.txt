So I have questions based on this thread:
1) What exactly is the hacker doing here with the cell phone vendor?  He is trying to convince a phone operator to port the phone number from your SIM card to a SIM in a device he holds?
2) Why does the hacker even need step 1), since from what I read the SMS network itself is not secure and hackers can intercept your SMS and read it even when they do not control your phone.  This is the well-known security defect in the ATT switching hardware.
3) Is there ANY cell phone vendor who has a better authentication procedure for customer accounts?  For example, how hard would it be to allow customers to configure a mobile account to use Google Authenticator, and then reps on the phone ask for that code before accessing account information.
4) Obviously a strong message here is to not use SMS 2FA for key financial accounts or for Google accounts.   But for less-important websites that only offer SMS 2FA, is there any more safe way to make this work?    One way might be to have an unpublished prepaid 3G phone only used for security and register it on a different network than your published cell phone?   Would there be any advantages to using a "Burner" type SMS phone, which is not registered to your individual name and is routed through the Burner network to their TCP application?   
5) Is there any area code in the US that does NOT use the ATT switching equipment that has the SMS privacy bug?  Maybe there would be sense in getting a mobile number in that area code and using that for your 2FA functions on non-critical sites?
6) Does this report suggest that one should not tie important financial accounts online to mobile phones as even a contact phone?   Is there any better security in using a home-based plain old telephone service (POTS) instead of a mobile phone as a primary contact number?

How do they define volume?  I was guessing that a site like that was defining volume as a currency pair trade.  So - for example - the amount of Bitcoin traded for US Dollars....
This would totally miss the amount of the currency being used for purchases, where the buyer is purchasing goods or services, and the seller is retaining the cryptocurrency.
With some of these currencies, there is a lot of activity buying and selling the currency, and almost zero activity using the currency to do anything real.  That speaks to the purely speculative nature of some of the cryptocurrencies.  The demand is based on something imagined or potential.   What I am trying to determine is approximately how much real commercial activity is being done with each currency.  I am excluding the currency pair trades and focusing exclusively on real economic activity to buy or sell goods or services.

An Amazon VISA card still pays the VISA transaction fees on every transaction where it is used.
An Amazon cryptocurrency would completely bypass any financial middlemen, and Amazon would be acting as a trusted third party and operating its financial processing network at lower cost to Amazon than paying the VISA transaction fees.
They might use Bitcoin, but with the transaction fees being so high that does not seem like a revolutionary strategy.

Sorry for a noob question, but what are the factors that cause difficulty to increase?   What I don't understand is why is price following difficulty in such an aligned way over time?  I realize the miners need this to break even on their costs, but the market should not care at all about what the miners need, relative to day to day pricing of bitcoin.   I would have expected price and difficulty to be less correlated.

Satoshi never referred to bit gold in the original paper, which is inconceivable because it was very clear that Bitcoin was modeled on bit gold.  I haven't found any references showing Satoshi referring to bit gold in e-mail or forum posts.
Szabo's ONLY reference to Bitcoin in all of 2009 is this post:
which contains the underwhelming declaration "Satoshi Nakamoto has implemented BitCoin which very similarly uses a dense Byzantine fault tolerant peer-to-peer network and and cryptographic hash chains to ensure the integrity of a currency."
The gentleman doth protest too little, me thinks. :)
Nick says nothing in his blog about Bitcoin in 2010.  How is that even possible when 2010 is the year when Bitcoin broke the one cent barrier and climbed over 20 cents per Bitcoin.
Nick's first real discussion of Bitcoin is later in 2011:
And of course this timing is suspicious, because Satoshi abandons participation in his own project at the end of 2010.   So Satoshi appears and Nick goes silent.   Satoshi disappears and suddenly there's Nick talking about cryptocurrency in detail again.  
The Bitcoin whitepaper talks about the authors as "we".  Assuming that this is not the royal "we", my best guess is that Szabo could have authored the whitepaper and architected the main ideas in the system, and Hal Finney might have done significant amounts of the coding.   
Finney is the one who did the original proof of work prototypes many years before Bitcoin.  Finney's Reusable Proof-of-Work (RPOW) was a prototype for digital cash based on Szabo's theory of collectibles.    So these two went back together a long time, and there is no way that they would not have been in communication about such an important idea, assuming Szabo was the primary mover of Bitcoin.
It's also hysterical that on the day Satoshi released the first Bitcoin code, the very first respondent online is Hal Finney, and what Hal says is both historical and extremely telling.   Hal doesn't go into geek speak.  Hal elaborates in a very clear and cogent way what the potential market size is for Bitcoin and gives his personal best case calculation for the value of a Bitcoin, if it becomes a world currency.  Hal uses that as an inspiration to others to start mining.  The e-mail correspondence that Finney released to a reporter later on suggests an innocent technical conversation between himself and Satoshi.   But the public post I am referencing suggests a much deeper understanding of, and commitment to, the economic ideas behind Bitcoin.  And it makes clear that Finney's interest went well beyond helping a fellow programmer to test some software.

I don't understand your reliable source's suggestion, but it seems to runs counter to China's whole currency policy.   
The Chinese have been massive cheaters on their currency for decades.  The entire Chinese strategy for growing the Chinese economy has been to keep the Chinese currency artificially low - far below where it would trade in a real free market - in order to create the illusion that Chinese goods and services are far cheaper than other manufacturing countries.
If the Chinese tie their currency to gold, how can they continue to cheat?   What happens when gold goes up 30%?  How do the Chinese in this case keep their currency fixed?   If you tie your currency to gold then you have to accept that the currency's value will fluctuate to the value of the underlying physical asset.   That is something China will never allow to happen.
What might be more true is that China might be proposing a new currency entirely, to be used exclusively for the oil trade, and with the currency's value reflecting the price of gold.

To make sure I understand this:  the blockchain records that some bitcoins were sent to a specific address.   If there is a situation where multiple people have the private keys to that address, then any of those people are in a position to spend the bitcoins.
By sweeping the coins, the old address is no longer showing on the blockchain as possessing any of the coins.  So if someone else has a private key for that address, they cannot use it to spend the coins.
Does the block chain record specific serial numbers of each coin that is sent to an address?    
If you sweep the coins, isn't that going to create a public record of where the coins moved?   I guess a hacker that steals your coins is going to sweep them through a mixer that makes it hard to see these movements?

From the About page of the organization "The National Internet Finance Association of China (NIFA) is a national self-regulatory organization in the field of internet finance and is initiated by the People’s Bank of China in collaboration with relevant ministries and commissions including the CBRC, the CSRC, and the CIRC according to the stipulations in Guiding Opinions on Promoting the Healthy Development of Internet Finance (2015 No. 221) jointly issued on July 18, 2015 by ten ministries and commissions including the People’s Bank of China, the CBRC, the CSRC, the CIRC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the Ministry of Public Security, and the SAIC, with the approval by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council."
That's about as Chinese-government-based as an organization gets?
The problem I see is the document is not internally consistent.   On one hand the document seems to be advising investors about risks and "...investors are advised to enhance their awareness of risks."  On the other hand, the document concludes with the stronger statement "NIFA hereby calls on all member institutions to fulfill their commitment to industry self-regulation...refrain from participating in or providing services for any forms of centralized trading of 'virtual currencies'".   That sentence is a mess.  It talks about self-regulation, which implies the activities are permitted, but it concludes with what could be construed as an outright ban on virtual currency trading.

If the wires are domestic then I don't know.   I was going to hypothesize that the size and locations of your transfers had lighted you up in someone's system as possible money laundering.   That's one of the horrible side effects of all of these new "know your customer" laws.
The worst example of how these laws have gone bad is what happens now with MoneyGram, if you try to send $50 to Eastern Europe from the US.   You spend 30 minutes with them on the phone convincing them that you are real, and then they cancel the transaction without explanation.  The next day, they cancel your web account and say that the "security department did not like the risk profile of the account".   The Internet is filled with thousands of people who have the same event happen, sending trivial amounts of money to relatives outside the US.
So, without knowing the particulars, I would say you have been profiled by someone somewhere, based on your pattern of financial activity.   Welcome to the "land of the free".

What I would really fear is Amazon creating its own cryptocurrency.  They have more than enough skill to execute on that and they would probably do it better because they can focus on user experience.   They could roll this out to a huge audience of people and get them very used to using the service because of the tie-in to Amazon commerce.   You would likely be able to fund their currency using Bitcoin.
The whole point of this for Amazon would be to reduce customer costs and reduce the drag on price represented by the VISA/Mastercard credit/debit that is used for most Amazon purchases today.   Their business model would be to take a financing fee on each transaction using their currency off the Amazon website that is likely to be lower than what Bitcoin charges.

Is the issue that he should change the private key on the BTC wallet before attempting to re-use the original private key on the BCH wallet?
Since I am a noob to BTC, can you describe in more detail the steps that should be followed on the BTC wallet after you successfully import from the paper wallet?    Would the same type of sequence need to be followed on the BCH wallet after you import there as well?

Having read the article and his analysis, you would have to say he was NOT a speculator.  He quite convincingly shows that he understood the key innovations of Bitcoin at a deep technical level, and he in parallel understood that the stage of development in 2013 paralleled early days of the Internet.  He never invested in the technology alone.  He went through a market-sizing exercise based on a reasonable market that Bitcoin might displace.
His thinking was more like an angel investor or a venture capitalist.   It's clear he took a large risk.   At his age to put more than 30% of life savings into a single investment took guts.

I agree Szabo is probably Satoshi.   You left out the most telling pieces of evidence:
6 - Nick went silent in the critical year when Bitcoin was released
7 - Nick failed to release a competitive product to Bitcoin, in spite of the fact that Nick had put up a public post asking for help in coding up Bit Gold just months before the Bitcoin white paper was released.  Why would Nick not view Bitcoin as a competitor and speed up the release of his own project?   
Who would just sit by and let someone else take your ideas for free and say and do nothing about it?   If Nick wanted to throw in the towel and back Bitcoin, why didn't he do that too?    It is incomprehensible that someone with such good ideas about cryptocurrency - who was actively pursuing a coding of his ideas just months before Bitcoin was released - would sit silent and just watch.
This is the case where the absence of action is even more telling than the presence.
@_date: 2017-09-12 03:51:13
Exactly right.  And that is almost exactly the definition of a speculative bubble.   In 1999 and 2000 it was obvious to everyone that the Internet was a revolutionary idea that had incredible value.  But none of the actual companies being traded as stocks had anything like the value that was being assigned to them.  The Internet bubble was all about millions of investors understanding that the Internet had value, and there was too little stock to hold their money, so the prices of those stocks exploded.
Come 2002, 90% of those companies ceased to exist.   The survivors re-adjusted valuation to 10% of their speculative value.
The way you know that a supply/demand imbalance is a speculative bubble is that no one can ever put forward a cogent analytical calculation of valuation that justifies the price.  That is exactly what I see with Bitcoin today.   Everyone knows it has value.  No one can cogently calculate what that value should be.  So it keeps marching towards $10K, but that is based on pure speculation, not true value.
@_date: 2017-09-16 08:10:59
Okay, so the sequence would be:
1) Import private key from paper to the BTC wallet
2) After import is confirmed, sweep from the old key to a new one
3) After sweep is confirmed, import the original paper wallet private key to the BCH wallet
Presumably the BTC wallet already has a new seed so no step was necessary there to create a new seed?  In the situation where the paper wallet was recovering to the same wallet that was originally used to create the paper wallet, is there any rationale for creating a new seed?
For the sweep transaction, you are effectively just doing a transfer from your wallet to your wallet, through the Bitcoin network?  Does that create any security risk?
@_date: 2017-09-12 04:00:22
Well the survivors like Amazon did well for investors who picked them up in the aftermath of the Internet crash.  But those are commercial enterprises with return on equity from growing operations that exceeded 20%/year.  Anything that grows its economic activity at 20%/year for decades makes you quite rich.   A valuation for a currency with a stable supply would need to be based on very different principles.   So it is not a perfect analogy to compare a crypto currency to a commercial enterprise.

Consider that this transaction might have been driven by the buyer's needs instead of the sellers.   The buyer might not have wanted to have the visibility of selling so much bitcoin on an exchange and generating a large 1099 from that.   It might trigger an audit in which all of the taxpayer's Bitcoin holdings would be inspected.
To incent the seller to just accept a direct payment by Bitcoin, the buyer may have agreed to a higher sales price, or to other concessions on the sale, that more than made up for the seller's 1% conversion fee.
This raises a question:  when do Bitcoin exchanges in the US have to create 1099s for a Bitcoin account holder?   If the Bitcoins come into the account at value $X and then get sold for USD at $X+$Y presumably that is viewed as a capital gain and reported as a currency gain?   Or is this still the Wild Wild West and there is no clear ruling on how to report this?   If the Bitcoins leave the account as Bitcoins and never realize a gain by sale, presumably there is less of a reporting requirement?

The problem is that for many governments, the citizens are not free.  If you are a US citizen, at some point the IRS may say that you have to declare all Bitcoin holdings, just as you would a foreign bank account.  And if you don't then there is some horrific tax penalty (like 25% of your Bitcoin asset).  Then, at some point, if the US government feels that Bitcoin threatens its national security, they might outlaw the possession of Bitcoin by US citizens. 
How do you pursue freedom in an environment where the government is becoming more and more like an Orwellian 1984 surveillance organization, and the mere act of pursuing freedom and privacy is made illegal by statute?  I am all for freedom and privacy, but my point is you cannot have either freedom or privacy unless you are a citizen of a country that gives you those things as a matter of constitution and law.

In an environment where a bitcoin miner has large operating profits (e.g., bitcoin mining rewards far exceed electrical and other operating costs), the limitation on growth of a miner will be in other areas, like finding the capital to invest further amounts.
None of that matters to my question.    I am asking about a very specific scenario, where bitcoin mining rewards do not cover the cost of electricity and the entire operating business model needs to shift to transaction fees.
What if this happened suddenly and the mining capacity on the network dropped 80% in one month?   What does that imply for performance?  What does that imply for fees?  Relative to fees, I am trying to understand how the fee structure today relates to the cost to mine one block.   I'm trying to build a quantitative model, not just understand generic principles.

Regarding 3), what I am really asking is whether there is any cell phone network provider that has a better-formed concept of customer security.   Authenticating the caller on an account using a Google Authenticator code instead of relying on SMS would be one example of that.  If the phone is stolen and you cannot provide the code, then the vendor would take you through a harder verification.   These days that might be tough since so many large consumer databases have been stolen and hackers might know quite a lot about you.
My question on 6) was whether we could safely use a home phone (POTS) for both an alternate second factor authentication as well as for account recovery.   That depends on your living situation, and obviously if you are single you are going to feel better doing that than if you have two drug addicts living with you.   I am assuming the main risk if you relied on POTS phone would be someone wire tapping you.  Would the home phone be subject to the same SS7 flaw, therefore making even POTS lines subject to easy remote tapping by hackers?

Great explanation thanks.   It's clear however that anyone who invested in the infrastructure to put the blockchain into a database would be able to dig out the same information, by following the path of one address over time.
I guess this is where the idea of a mixer comes in?   If the outgoing transaction goes through a mixer where there are - for example - 20 inputs and 40 outputs, then establishing linkages between inputs and outputs becomes much more difficult unless each side of the transaction can be matched on either an exact unusual quantity or based on some enormous sizing.
When people submit to a mixer, it is pooling transactions until it gets enough of them, then it puts together the mega transaction and submits that to a block?

In 1999 and 2000, 90%+ of valuation of Internet companies was speculative.  The value was not slightly affected by speculation.  Almost the entire valuation was speculative.   The idea that the current value of Bitcoin is 10% determined by speculation is clearly wrong.

Yes, I understand, but the basic valuation approach is still intact.  You are taking a forex market and projecting some percent of it onto a limited number of cryptocurrency units in supply.

We are entering an era similar to an Orwellian 1984 where the government wants to see into every transaction of your financial life.   They forbid people from owning foreign bank accounts unless they declare those on a tax return, and if you do not do that then there are stiff penalties.   I suspect Bitcoin will end up being something similar.  Government will demand knowledge of any Bitcoins you hold in your own software/hardware wallets.
And to further clarify my original point, I don't think any government can stop Bitcoin or stop the entire Bitcoin network.   But if the government prevents you from owning the coins legally - and if you want to follow the law - then what good does it do to have a working network that you cannot participate in?

I am still a noob on wallets and Bitcoin addresses, but could someone explain to me do most modern software wallets allow you to completely disassociate your bitcoins in the wallet from the addresses that they were sent to?
If yes, then the selection of a sending or receiving address is just a matter of arbitrarily selecting one from a pool of addresses that your wallet has available?   The wallet can then mark this address as used so that you do not accidentally re-use it in the future?
People talk about immediately sweeping funds you receive from the address you received it on to a new address.  What would be the point of this if the coins are not hard-wired to specific addresses?
In the blockchain, if you sweep a coin from the address you received it on to a new address, won't someone just be able to follow the blockchain and see the connection between the address you received on and the new address you are sending to?
@_date: 2017-09-12 04:08:39
So when I Google those terms, there are lots of articles - that I completely accept on face value - explaining why Bitcoin has value.   I said in the original question that Bitcoin has value.  I recognize that it is an enormous cryptographic achievement.  I recognize that it is the future.

Moving solves no problem.  The US is a mean spirited tax jail that taxes your worldwide income no matter where you live and work.
If you are saying "renounce your citizenship", they have a response to that as well.   They seize a large percentage of your assets when you exit.    If you hide assets and they later find out you have them, they go after you criminally.
If you truly want to pursue an abstract idea of freedom, without violating any law, then you would need to renounce your citizenship, surrender some non trivial part of your assets as part of your exit, and build a new life for yourself with a different citizenship and economic existence.
For people who are worth fortunes, that is possible.  For ordinary people who are simply working for wages, that is a utopian fantasy and is not a practical real option.    Bitcoin gives such people imagined freedom, but in fact very little real freedom.   The source of freedom is in the laws and constitution of the nation state.   And the sad truth is that the US is losing more and more freedom and is becoming a paranoid, highly intrusive, and mean-spirited jail.

They have New York State regulation.  You can file a complaint with the regulator, but I don't think you have a case based on a maintenance time window extending a few hours.

Is the hash signing the sender's account using the sender's private key?   That's the proof that the request came from the real account owner?    How does everyone know which sending account number created that hash, in order to grab the correct public key to verify the signature?

A valuation where you define a target market, a target market share, and then show a required value per bitcoin is objective.  It has subjective elements, and it involves a lot of guessing, but there is an underlying analytical method to get to an estimated value.   I accept that approach.
I disagree that we cannot "create a target valuation for something that has never existed before."   Every one of thousands of startups that get funded by VCs create target valuations for things that have never existed before.  How accurate those valuations might be is a different issue, but usually the point of an early valuation is to show order of magnitude and not precision.
To contrast, saying that a Bitcoin is worth $500K because that is what someone would need to pay you for it, is pure speculation.  It doesn't demonstrate with any rigor what the order of magnitude of the value should be.
Your attempted valuation is one of only two responses in this thread that look like real attempts at valuation.   I appreciate that!

Something I don't understand about the Bitcoin model for miners:  isn't your probability of successfully mining a coin greatly affected by the numbers of other miners doing the same activity?   How can a calculator like the Coinwarz calculator be accurate without knowing the odds that someone else will mine the Bitcoins before you do?
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:24:10
I agree with the conclusion that the system as designed appears to tolerate a permanent loss of a lot of the 21 million Bitcoins.  That said, the actual math would be a larger number:  1,050,000,000,000,000 satoshis

When you join into a pool, do you get a part of the transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:32:37
Which ones have you looked at?  What kinds of fees did you encounter?
Ironically, all of these prepaid cards have less risk for banks yet typically have higher fees.  I guess that it the bank trying to hold its margin since it won't be able to charge you 20% interest rates :)
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:53:34
Can you help us read that?   10 Bitcoins are to Finney, and the other 40 are being returned to Satoshi (presumably)?   A noob question:  does Bitcoin require that all of the coins on the original address be spent and the excess coins get paid to yourself?   I'm not clear on why the additional 40 would need to be sent.
Another noob question:  the From and To addresses in these blocks are not the actual addresses, but are hashes of the public keys of the addresses?

All of that begs the question what is the cost of electricity in China.
@_date: 2017-09-12 04:19:03
I am not saying those valuations are wrong.   I am asking for a pointer to any article that cogently constructs an analytical argument whose output valuation is the numbers you suggest.
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:50:47
Let's use specific numbers to help understand if there is a potential problem.
Say that Bitcoin pricing drops to $300.  Say that the cost of electricity in mining a Bitcoin is at $0.06 per Kwh, an industrial rate.  So the breakeven cost for mining a Bitcoin would be around $550.   It depends on the efficiency of your rig, but the exact number does not matter here.  Let's not get caught up in that minutiae.  The point is that there are use cases where the network cannot incentivize miners to work.
In that example, users would have to bid up transaction fees to total $250 in order to get a miner interested in the transaction? ($300 is the value of the Bitcoin that they mine, plus $250 in total transaction fees, equals $550 realized from mining the Bitcoin to cover the $550 cost of mining the Bitcoin.)   How much would the user fee in this example be per transaction, just using typical numbers of transactions?
If the network gets into this situation - and choose whatever numbers you like for electricity and rig efficiency - could it enter into a deadlock where very few users are willing to pay for a transaction and no miners are willing to do transactions that users will not pay up for?   I am interested in seeing numbers that show that this is either impossible or highly unlikely.

That's an nice reference, but market cap is not the same as transaction volume.  Given the underlying speculation in crypto currencies, market cap might not even have any relationship to transaction volume.

Thanks for these explanations.   When you import a key to a wallet, does the wallet typically flag for you which keys are NOT seed keys?

I would worry more about Amazon doing this than Facebook.  It would bypass the huge toll charge on every Amazon purchase imposed by VISA, thereby greatly expanding Amazon margins.   Because of the vast number of transactions that Amazon processes every day, an Amazon currency could achieve critical mass just from Amazon's transactions alone, and it would likely spread into other commercial applications quickly.

What is the largest transaction anyone has seen on LocalBitcoin?  I was thinking try multiple $50K transactions on LocalBitcoin, so that site is the escrow agent.
If you want a single buyer, any of the Silicon Valley venture firms that are investing in Bitcoins typically have partners who heavily invest in Bitcoins.   Plan on spending $10K in legal fees if you have to deal with a large sophisticated private buyer.

Now that is a serious attempt at a valuation argument.  Thank you.
So the key to that would be predicated on keeping supply of crypto currencies constrained.  It's not clear to me in a situation where 10% of the US monetary base converts to crypto currencies, why wouldn't that happen across 10 crypto currencies instead of just one or two?

That's probably not good tax planning.  In the event the bitcoin is worth a fortune someday, gifting it to him will reduce your estate tax exemption by a large amount.  Better to gift it to him now - document that - and let him know about it when he turns 18.
Better that he sell and pay a capital gains tax than you gift it at potentially high estate tax rates.

One of the most interesting graphs I have found for Bitcoin is the logarithmic historical price chart.  What that shows is that Bitcoin went from its inception to August 16, 2010 with essentially zero value.  It was not steadily growing.  Suddenly, on August 17, 2010, it gets a value of 6 cents, and everything starts to grow from that moment forward.
What was the historical event on August 17, 2010 that gave Bitcoin a value?

Good point on brand and first-mover recognition.   But all crypto currencies are rising in the same speculative fashion.   And that cannot be right either because there are zero barriers to entry to create new crypto currencies.    
Everyone wants to pretend like there is limited supply of crypto currency, when the truth is more like there is an infinite supply of crypto currency, looking across all possibly currencies that exist and could be created de novo.

So what appears on the left side is the current balance in the blockchain of the spending address?    And the right side indicates the final disposition of all of that original balance?

So is this what they call a "sweep" transaction?   I hear people say when you receive coins from an address that may have been compromised that you should "sweep" them to a new address.

Someone can - and probably someone has - done a calculation for what the valuation could be.   The assumptions behind that calculation might be based on numbers of commercial transactions and actual use of the currency once it becomes established.    I would love to read through such a valuation.  I am open to it.
And the only established comparator for value of Bitcoin today is fiat currencies, so what exactly are you using to establish value if not that?  Gold?  How does that help us here?

If you are using a wallet with deterministic addresses, like Electrum, and you have your private keys on an offline computer and you use a wallet with only public keys connected to the Internet, how does the change address work?
The original transaction is created on the Internet-connected Electrum wallet and signed by the offline computer.   Doesn't the Internet-connected Electrum wallet create the change address to use in the transaction?   When the transaction is done, does the offline wallet know about the change address and guarantee that it correctly reflects the balance on that change address?
Do wallets like ELectrum clearly show you which of your addresses is a change address?
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:12:25
So is your wallet maintaining an association between an address and the number of bitcoins the blockchain thinks are associated with that address?   If you go to send out those bitcoins, is the wallet going to insist on re-using the same address unless you sweep the coins?

Amazon is a well-trusted third party and they can process transactions centrally for pennies that cost the Bitcoin networks 100 times more because of the high electrical costs.
Ultimately the people who care about the decentralization of Bitcoin are libertarians, anarchists, and criminals, and none of those three represent the mainstream population that would be the users of these currencies.
I am not arguing my own preferences.  I am simply elaborating the original question and pointing out that Amazon could create a very devastating competitive technology that would end up being used by one hundred million people in real every day transactions quickly.    Since 95% of Bitcoin is speculators holding on the belief that someday it will be worth more money, and only 5% of Bitcoin is real commercial transactions, that is a competitive threat that cannot be easily dismissed.

I think you helped me figure it out.   The Mt Gox exchange started in July 2010, so it might well be that the graph is showing the first recorded transactions from Mt Gox.
