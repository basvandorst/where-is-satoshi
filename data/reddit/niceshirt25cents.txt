I can ship them anywhere but the shipping price wouldn't be too cheap. Something to consider before purchasing.

Which design and size?

Where did you get $15.00?
Offloading and selling a single shirt doesn't really seem to go hand in hand.
Maybe incentive to buy more in bulk...

How many you interested in and in what size?

That was a month ago but even in that same post there were prices for $5.00 a shirt if they were bought in bulk. 
Idea being to get rid of the shirts as soon as possible opposed to slowly selling one at a time.  :)

I can set up a store for you guys to buy these I suppose. Not sure what the other best way to ship these out for you guys would be.
Any suggestions?

I'll have to get back to you on that. I can ship overseas but might be too expensive, I'll have to get back to you on that one.

Lol you're silly. 
They are printed on Next Level shirts. Then there is the price of getting them printed. Then there is shipping... 
The price of $15.00 isn't even given in this post and there is also a price of $5.00 if bought in bulk in the same post. You really think I'll be able to get rid of all these shirts selling them one at a time? 
Have a good day.

Lol $3.00 huh?  
You're guessing wrong unfortunately. All printed up.
