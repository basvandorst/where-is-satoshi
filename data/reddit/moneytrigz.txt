bitpay is the worse charging 160x the current bitcoin fee, just to help bcash/bitmain

roger ver and friends,
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:45:31
lol thanks ;)
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:02:27
noobs selling? right ive been holding bitcoin since $200 bro, and sold majority @ $1200 because this issue was only getting worse.
ur the noob for saying such immature things, people are protecting their wealth in case price correction comes due to this civil war on the point of breaking out, or u say that cuz u hold very small amount of btc.
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:53:10
dude i sold @ $1200 + and have been holding since $200 while price now is @ $1040 so i dont know what ur talking about, so no panic sell, very calculated and well thought out. and working fine till now im in + but thanks for your concern.
@_date: 2016-12-11 12:55:00
very interesting, i might have to write an article about this on cointimes, educate the community about it. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 08:33:28
meanwhile ur position already rekt lol 
@_date: 2016-12-18 16:38:26
i created food4venezuela.com
and twitter 
im working on the site to make familias able to post photos and videos, hopefully i can make the twitter auto-post it as a bot online.
ive contacted my cousin's cousin that lives there.
he said he stands hours in line and sometimes there is nothing left and many people/families dont have food.
he said also have to be careful how we send the food because gov officials are looting everything they can.
for people living close to the colombian border they have to go to the border and stand for hours to get their food, but for the people living further from border, its very difficult to get essentials, 
we asked him to please make videos with familias in need to i can post online and if he can start periscope with us so we can stream it globally for everybody to see and join the movement, 
i would say priority to get food packages to families with young infants and babies.
ill try to get as much content possible but i think the  would be good medium of communication in communication with the website food4venezuela.com
Well release article on Cointimes.tech to get some attention on this matter.
we could make some familias a better christmas and new years with some basic food.

Hedge against the state :)
@_date: 2016-12-18 18:06:44
follow  (food4venezuela.com)
we started an initiative thanks to this post by thyrmos.
lets group our efforts and help families in need.
@_date: 2016-12-22 15:10:54
---------&gt;$10.000 estimate 2018 &lt;----------
PLEASE PUT YOUR ESTIMATE so we can compare, 
not opinions ;P
@_date: 2016-11-29 21:58:00
then you did not follow bitcoin's progress with brexit vote results came in, 
@_date: 2016-12-19 07:55:49
today i will be getting direct contact and phone number with the son of my cousins uncle which both live in venezuela.
we will be talking and trying to get videos of families in need.
ill be posting it on  twitter account on youtube.
hopefully we can get in contact with families that have children that need basic essentials of food.
which even if you have money its almost impossible to get,
my personal twitter is 
Cointimes.tech is helping sponsor the first few packages.
we are not asking for donations, we are trying to create a communication channel for families and need and people outside venezuela could send food directly themselves (small packages only) big packages get confiscated (we have been told by the locals)
@_date: 2016-12-17 20:56:16
@_date: 2016-12-18 13:51:11
I have a cousin of my cousin in venezuela and their family,
i think sending packages via mail would be the most handy.
maybe if we create some kind of website platform where families and individuals can post their story and situation we could organise/crowdfund packages being sent to every individual story/family.
would make for a good way helping those in need.
the prices are surging with certain supply, would be bigger bang for the buck.
for example im a father, and i cant imagine now getting babypowder or essential for the little one.
im admin and author at cointimes.tech im willing to help/donate for such a movement/project.
ill send 5 boxes to 5 families in need.
and willing to donate time and money to help build the site.
visual to get people involved i think is a must in this case to go viral, allot of people dont have time to read post per post on reddit.
my twitter 
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:14:09
wow really? just for food? even without saying their names? will be difficult to get the message viral without some video content to inform people around the world.
@_date: 2016-12-18 18:23:19
our local source is saying the same, all packages are confiscated.
this is worse then we thought, we are trying to find a by-pass here to reach the families who need basic food.
@_date: 2016-12-07 14:58:43
hahahaha ejection? 
@_date: 2016-12-18 17:45:20
and private courier service, u mean which companies? because i know that fedex wont ship food.
any recommendations? your in venezuela?
pls follow us  (food4venezuela.com)
@_date: 2016-12-17 17:37:22
its allive :) 
the best is yet to come for bitcoin
cant wait!
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:48:36
i estimate with ETF approval we will reach bottem $2000/$3000 and $5000 (peak) 2017 and by 2018 well hit $10.000
is my estimate

@_date: 2016-12-18 16:58:35
ive just been informed from the uncle living there, gov officials are confiscating all packages with food, medicine, everything.
im trying to get more information in details to see other means of sending, till now he said only people traveling with luggage are able to bring in.
its much worse then expected, ill post more info here and twitter account 
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:44:04
2017 we will be reaching $2000/$3000 no doubt :)
ETF approval hint hint.....
@_date: 2016-12-18 17:43:58
yes we just communicated with an uncle living there and your right, all packages seem to be confiscated, food medicine everything.
we are trying to 1) get videos from them to put online 2) try to find a way to send the food via other services (if that is even possible)
@_date: 2016-12-18 22:22:11
oh well help we are already in the process with locals there.
ill be posting on 
its cause we had a good year im going to do it, 
reddit trolls deff leaving bad taste in my mouth but i wont let them effect starving families not getting food.
@_date: 2016-12-19 08:34:59
thanks! i agree
check out this video and shows the example ive been making
u cannot buy essentials even if you have money, money people dont understand this.
and even if you can the prices are 10x more expensive.
thats why we trying to send small packages of essential which are cheap for us.
flower, powder milk, rice, canned food, dried fruit, comes to mind.
even if we can only help a few families i want to do my part.
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:50:59
yes i agree ,that should be the standard responds from now on ;)
@_date: 2016-12-07 12:32:47
seems realistic, could go much higher after ETF gets approved.
@_date: 2016-12-19 10:23:51
yes anything that is well preserved, 
rice, beans, stuff like that go far, allot of people living in city and towns are situation is difficult for gardens. 
i think ill send rice, beans, dried fruit, powdered milk. in my first package ill be documenting everything.
communication with the families in need, and my box, the content in it, and the transport getting it there, and with them receiving it.
after that is done successfull im going to try to send 10x after the first arrives, and document those and show everybody how its done. :)
food4venezuela.com 
anybody know venezuelans families in need, let them contact me.
we can get the story out and i can send them box of food which is impossible to get their even with money.
@_date: 2016-12-19 09:09:45
incorrect, the venezuelan guy in this thread has confirmed that SMALL PACKAGES arrive there, ONLY BIG ONES get confiscated.
he has been receiving small packages from family abroad and with that he has been able to eat and survive.
ive repeated this 5x in the forum its a bit difficult to keep repeating the same thing,
we will be posting pictures and content of the small boxes from our end and received in venezuela,
well be doing not talking, and ill be posting as much content.
ill be chatting directly with family members of my cousin there today.
@_date: 2016-12-15 20:53:02
thanks for reminder, slowly but surely wins the race :)
@_date: 2016-12-18 18:24:45
our local source is saying they confiscate all packages, with food medicine everything, when is the last time you sent food to venezuela? are you living there now? pls follow us  or food4venezuela.com
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:40:01
place ur bet accordingly, im sure u didnt long the brexit neither :P
@_date: 2016-12-05 16:50:10
which decision is already priced in? it can go both ways.
fed can raise interest rates or not.
@_date: 2016-12-18 22:15:28
i have contact with family members of my cousin there, and we will be sending food packages. 
no more talk, we will be posting pictures online.
this is our own initiative on our own dime.
we are here to get in contact with venezualans in need, we dont need donations. just families in venezuela that are not able to get food.
people are trolling me here thinking we are asking for money while they dont even read the full posts, funny how people even when you want to do good people try to put you down.
but we'll post content and atleast help the people we know down there cuz with all the noise its difficult to organise here ;)
@_date: 2016-12-18 20:05:24

@_date: 2016-12-18 19:29:54
