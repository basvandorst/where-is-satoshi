No offense, but this currency doesn't need any more "dumb money". I suggest you read more into the currency.

Hi. Sorry to hear of your loss. Were you buying Bitcoin to make money, or were you buying Bitcoin to use it as a currency?
@_date: 2013-04-05 21:34:11
You're missing the point and honing in too much on an example I gave. Rent is one of many avenues of using currency that many people use everyday; other examples are buying groceries, filling up their gas tank, getting plastered at a bar, and eating out at a restaurant.
Your comment regarding not needing to hold bitcoin to accept it, though, is certainly something I haven't thought of. Right now, little to no local businesses accept bitcoin, especially in the midwest where I live. This could change in time, at which point my argument becomes moot. Assuming this recent price hike was caused by speculative mania, if bitpay offers enough of an insulation against volatility in such a way as to survive a crash in the value of Bitcoins, then possibly more merchants will accept bitcoin at a faster pace. Only time will tell.

When I say prosperous, I mean useful, liquid, and stable in value, and used by many many people each day in some marketplace. Bitcoin has been useful as a currency in the unique properties that is was designed to hold. However, it is not as liquid as the US dollar, and the stability has been in question for the past few days. The stability will be even more riskful if this surge was caused by an investment-induced mania, similar to what I felt for a few brief minutes over the weekend.
The liquidity will increase after time if it is a useful currency. In order for it to be useful, though, people need to treat Bitcoin as a currency, not an investment. I may be preaching to the wrong crowd, as I am sure the regulars of this subreddit treat Bitcoin as a currency.
Also, good use of *if and only if*. I don't see its use much outside of math circles.

Good luck, and don't put in what you cannot afford to lose.

Just because Bitcoin has these properties does not make it good currency. It must be a prospering currency in order for these properties to matter.

I understand the idealism, but face reality. Not everybody is going to want to mine Bitcoins. It's silly to think everybody would and should.
@_date: 2013-06-04 23:32:29
I can't buy my groceries, fill up my gas tank, pay my bills or rent with Bitcoin yet. That's one prominent argument against Bitcoin that isn't mirrored with cash.
Sure, there are some billpay services, but they are middlemen. That doesn't count. A few companies are offering the services I described, but they're still quite an infinitesimal minority.
@_date: 2013-05-31 12:31:22
Why would everybody want to mine their own Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:59:05
I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you bought low. My status as a student means I have little income to store in Bitcoin, and little time to keep up with the market.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:06:16
Well, that's cool. Sadly, not in the area. Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:50:22
Read up on Bitcoin more. There's a wealth of literature out there that you need to look into.

If my landlord accepts Bitcoin as a form of payment, I will consider this paying my rent in Bitcoins. Otherwise, I am still paying my rent in dollars.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:24:54
My landlord lives in another state. He has a local real estate company who manages the property and receives my check every month. The real estate company cashes the check, keeps a chunk as their management fee, and passes the rest of the money to the owner.
No, I have not asked my landlord about this possibility. I doubt it would be an option since a small minority of the people in my town know about Bitcoins well enough to understand how to use it.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:27:50
Yes, I looked into it. You're missing the point I am making. BitSpend offers a service as a middleman to convert your bitcoin to a fiat currency. Until I can directly send Bitcoins to my landlord as a form of payment, or purchase gasoline or buy my groceries **without needing a middleman**, I have little day-to-day use for Bitcoin.

My school specifically states that I would be expelled if I used school resources for my own personal gain. Be forewarned.
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:46:03
I'm talking about the gut reaction I had when I witnessed the surge. I wanted to buy low so I can sell high. I fear the grand majority of people who purchased Bitcoin within the last week have the same desire.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:15:22
I'm not blaming the protocol. I'm commenting that people should not purchase bitcoin as an investment, but rather should purchase it as a currency. My fear is that most people who recently started up in Bitcoin (recently, as in the last week) are people are purchasing it as an investment. If so, they may be pumping "dumb money" into the currency and holding onto their Bitcoin for an appropriate time to sell. Last week, I knew very little about how Bitcoin works. This week, I know a little more, but I still don't know as much as the veteraned Bitcoin users of this subreddit. Excuse my ignorance, but consider it proof that there indeed is a lack of understanding infiltrating the market, and those with vested interest in the market's prosperity need to be aware of this.

There has been some miscommunication, as I am not intending on investing with little risk, nor was I commenting on the time when one Bitcoin reaches $2000, or $20,000. I was referring to right now, investing $2000 in some Bitcoin as an example.
The reason I have not purchased any bitcoins is because I recognize the risk, and I am not ready to bet on the odds. Really, though, if Bitcoin is to be a currency, it shouldn't be used for investment.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:27:50
For the people who bought Bitcoins, and have been using them for the past few years as a form of currency, the only thing I can recommend (keep in mind, I am no economist) is that if a crash occurs, you still need to use your Bitcoin as a currency.
Buy stuff with it. Do not be held up in the fact that it once was worth $150 and is now worth significantly less, and in the hopes that it will one day be worth $150 again if you hold on to it. Use it for what its worth now, as that will hopefully start circulation up.
