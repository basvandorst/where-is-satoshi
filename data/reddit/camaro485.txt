Partially true yes I built gpu miners for altcoins. But I was mining btc back when you could still use cpus and I had a couple of jalapeños that mined btc then sold off to an "idiot" for more btc but just held for fun, never spent untill tonight

I'm not native, and looked it over a couple of times and didn't see anything that jumped out, I would like to make the correction if need be. I try really on my English.
