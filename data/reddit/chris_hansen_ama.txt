This sub is too much. I can't tell if this is a troll post or genuinely serious

UX Designer here - couple of thoughts after looking at your site. 
First, your design is very nice, I'm really impressed. However, after looking at the site and reading all the copy, I'm walking away quite unsure what this app will do beyond show me the prices of the different coins.
I think you need to work on a very clean, precise, and short value proposition message and put that front and center on your site. Tell me why you're different, tell me why my life will be improved by using this app, tell me why you're better than the rest. 
Copy from the website:


* What do you mean keep track of my bitcoins? Can I connect my crypto portfolio? Or just check prices?
* Smart notifications? How are they smart? Why do I want those? What will they do? 
* Widget complication? The terminology here is a little ambiguous and I'm not really sure what it means.
* How will Blackfolio change the way I follow my portfolio? 
My suggestion is to start answering the questions above and replace the copy to be more clear. Second, think about what features and functionality are most important to people in a crypto currency app, figure out what the biggest problems are with the other apps, and surface content on your website that talks about how your app addresses these things. 
You obviously have a smart team of developers and visual designers and I think if you tweaked your UX, you could be even more successful :) PM me if you want any more suggestions (or want to work together)

lol this sub is hilarious. Where were all the stories about Bitcoin Hodlers getting rekt when the price was cut in half in the matter of weeks?

If the answer is yes then I would love to hear about these opportunities as well!

Can I give away my Bitcoin to users in any sub? If so, I'm gonna start doing that!
