Welp your minority will continue to shrink as less people are letting themselves believe in fairytales even if that is unfortunate news to you 
@_date: 2018-09-10 00:59:20
I can understand if you are upset but please realize that there was life before christianity and there will continue to be after. Your way of viewing the world is somehow more arbitrary than others. You see reality as bull shit.
No amount of believing will make your fairytail real. Death is nothingness 
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:13:15
Wh... Wh.... What would be a risky investment to you? Betting on black at a casino?
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:33:25
sorry somebody made fun of your imaginary friend? Sorry buddy, this is a technology sub, not a follow blatant BS subreddit. Although now that I mention it... 
@_date: 2018-08-31 11:56:44
I think you would find it interesting that there are many well educated rappers out there. Not exactly sure what powers your hate for the dominant genre of music?
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:25:51
yes, you buy low, sell high, and read the candlesticks!!
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:15:12
if you didn't have such an ego, maybe you'd reflect on the criticism. You meet 100 assholes, maybe you're the asshole. Gl man I don't wish any bad on you, have fun dubblin that money up to 2k by 2021
@_date: 2019-11-10 01:50:35
At least my insults made sense and were on point. You just called me fat instead of using a real insult.
@_date: 2019-11-09 16:59:31
I work in the financial industry and all these wanna be traders make me laugh for the exact reason you are stating... they have no idea how fucked they are EVEN if they are successful. Most likely they will waste that money on depreciating goods (cars, etc) and then how are they going to pay that money back? gl getting your wages garnished for the rest of your life.  
oh, but then again, they would have to be successful for that to occur. The only way I see investing in bitcoin worth it is if you hold. Doing all these micro trades is macro retarded.
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:07:33
I agree it's where you end but you are out of touch with reality dude. I'm being honest. The way you are speaking about yourself is grandiose. And successful people don't have to brag to randos on the internet about their trading skills. And if you really were that intelligent, you'd have a lot more bitcoin by now. I'm surprised you've done all those psychedelics and still haven't killed your ego yet. Hence why I believe you are not mentally all there.
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:24:08
People like you are the reason I come to this sub. Somehow along the way, a blessing in technology has led to a bunch of easily manipulated sheep thinking they are the next wolves of wallstreet. Love it.  
Pay your taxes dood before it bites you in the ass
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:18:54
wow a whole two thousands american dollars? you know what. You are an investing god. I renege all of my previous statements. You sound like you know what you are doing
@_date: 2019-11-10 00:54:46
I'm sorry dude. If you live in the United States of America, and you don't have more than 800 dollars invested, you have no right to call yourself successful. There are people that start out trash poor and stay humble and become rich. If you have 800 dollars, you are at best hood rich, and this post is the most hood rich sht I've seen on this sub in a long time. 800 dollars is a lot to a family who is struggling to make ends meet.
800 dollars is not a lot for a white kid in America who sounds like they have had every opportunity to go to school, have internet connection, and the ability to brag about knowing everything about investing.
@_date: 2019-11-29 13:50:25
pure entertaining propaganda as we sit back and watch ;)
@_date: 2019-11-10 01:47:04
The fact that you can even get multiple people laughing at you for owning bitcoin in a bitcoin subreddit is an accomplishment in itself
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:03:48
your government doesn't tax money you earn??
@_date: 2019-11-09 15:07:34
Tax evasion is not a good look for someone coming off parole
@_date: 2019-11-09 20:15:17
yeah but then he can't powerlevel to his friends about how he owns "so much" bitcoin from making "intelligent trades" while he drives a beater around
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:50:58
I dont believe you will ever make enough online trading for it to matter, in fact you will likely lose your money unless you hold it in bitcoin (which is easily manipulated by sharks). 
But if you ever do.. the IRS will come on knocking. And it's unlikely you will be able to pay it with your crypto money. They can and will figure it out. You dont think these exchanges give the data to the government? How did you buy the coins? If its connected with your debit or PayPal you are phukked
@_date: 2019-11-12 01:49:00
It's more about the selling then the buying, you could probably google laws specific to your area (if your country has created some legal standard for crypto)
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:22:59
What would you say if your buddy was like, bro I know everything about trading, I have1k invested in bitcoin and 1k in shitcoins.   
Shit I'd need some Psychs at that point to understand how I fell so far in life to be hearing that statement
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:19:34
but you fail to realize, he knows EVERYTHING about trading so he is going to be rich soon
@_date: 2019-11-09 21:55:58
psh why would go to school to lern ecornomics if they were really succesfful theyd be makin MONEY not teachin
@_date: 2019-11-09 20:14:05
Fair enough, I'm sure there are countries that do it more "fairly" and less so, but in the end you still have to report something if you are gaining income. This dude isn't and he thinks he is the wolf of wallstreet lol
@_date: 2019-11-10 01:53:28
I'm not ask your mother. Also you just got off parole and mandated anti psychotics. I have a bachelors, a good job and real investments. You're just a poor kid trying to flex
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:28:16
Because it's hilarious seeing people like this get chopped down for the wisdom they believe they have.  
Bitcoin was so much more interesting when it wasn't about amassing wealth... sigh
@_date: 2019-11-10 00:50:45
Notice how multiple people are telling you how trashy and poor your attitude is? Lmao
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:01:47
you have a job, are very educated on bitcoin and trading... and only own .1 of a bitcoin? And you consider yourself successful?   
Am I missing something or are you joking? I think you are mentally ill
@_date: 2019-11-10 02:00:52
Good. Focus on that and stop the insanity. Invest in bitcoin but dont put energy in to timing trades and doing alt coins. Can you make money? Sure. Can you forever? No. And it takes one mistake. Go look at wallstreetbets and some of their trainwrecks. I'm sure you have. And lose your ego. It wont do you good
@_date: 2019-11-09 21:57:46
stop, stop, he's already dead
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:35:07
In a way I'm kinda glad that people like this exist. They don't do anything but harm themselves with their lack of awareness.
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:46:16
Have you reported your financial gains to the irs???
@_date: 2019-11-09 22:00:32
you prolly could have made a lot more getting a part time job instead of reading graphs trying to make 5 dollars a trade
@_date: 2019-11-10 01:56:50
I looked at a couple posts you made to see if you were a troll. All it confirmed is that you are a clueless kid going nowhere. Please go to college and go in to STEM. You need something stable and as long as you graduate with a decent GPA you'll make it bud. Stop day trading 1000 dollars.
@_date: 2019-11-10 01:48:43
I'm low 170s and run 30 mile a week. I guarantee I would smoke your ass
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:03:30
That’s what I’m saying. People aren’t saying “what” anymore 
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:10:07
whoa whoa whoa don't start trying to throw any logical thinking around in MY subreddit
@_date: 2018-06-03 23:02:02
Lol. Even with cash do you think that is an accurate statement?
@_date: 2018-06-16 16:50:49
I’m not saying most people truly understand it considering most of the posters in this sub probably don’t fully understand it technologically...
I’m saying how many people have never heard of bitcoin 
 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:25:57
if you don't sell
congrats you just played yourself
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:21:20
yup. this sub sucks now. It used to be interesting to read years ago. Now it's just idiots getting sucked in to whales pump and dumps. While the pump is going they feel like the wolf of wallstreet, when its not pumping, well you see the state of this sub. It's pathetic.
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:21:02
A defense that can not be argued against. I guess that's the crux of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:49:12
yeah but will it be equal to one garbleflex? (the currency of the undiscovered alien race that we will soon be trading with)
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:13:24
They don't realize they are one of the greatest spectacles of human stupidity to ever exist
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:24:39
to be fair, do you not think there are bitcoin shilling bots as well?
@_date: 2018-06-03 22:53:28
I think 5-10 years is very optimistic to say you will be set forever given that its coming on 10 years. I also think in terms of market saturation there are not many "new" faces to win over at this point. I just think you are banking on a lot and it's sad that bitcoin is gonna kill a lot of dreams
Honestly I'm starting to wonder if this whole "1 btc" dream is all a ploy
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:08:20
Do you think all of your customers appreciate this? Sounds kind of douchey to be honest
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:27:59
yea he also told me to start investing in a giant cheese grater to harvest all of the moons precious cheddar when we moon
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:45:21
he thinks the subreddit grew because of increased adoption... lol
@_date: 2018-06-03 21:37:15
you &gt;think&lt; you're going to be rich as fuck
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:50:43
It's not what your item it's worth it's what someone is willin gto pay
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:19:43
moon, lambo, we gonna get that cheddar and overthrow all the RICH people without having to work for it!
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:04:13
Idk I work at an investment company and the messages I have read internally are pretty negative 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:32:59
there is an uncountable amount of russian propaganda bots
yet there is not a single bot propagating bitcoin right
@_date: 2018-06-03 22:56:48
I'll get downvoted and you'll get upvoted. I like bitcoin but I also like speaking the truth.
Looking through your posts for 5 mins I see:
You buying in to bitcoin in December/Jan:








And then Three months later I see:


So I don't think you are really looking at the big picture. I think you are letting other people influence you. Really think about what you are doing. Don't listen to me, don't listen to 99% of the people on this subreddit, think about it yourself.
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:06:36
So why are you so sure they will if it’s so public 
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:54:16
Let me pose this question to you:
Who doesn’t know bitcoin by now?
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:02:12
And how many people are capable of grasping it in your mind if only .1% of the world currently does 
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:02:40
Obviously we are both just speculating. I just enjoy hearing the hives opinions so I can measure them against reality and understand what this community really believes.
I think that often people here act on faith and not science and that’s kinda scary considering real money is at play
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:41:25
No, I wouldn’t have said that. People not in to technology at all we’re talking about bitcoin during December. It was taking up a large amount of air time in anything investment related 
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:12:05
I would say it’s pretty hard to compare bitcoin to email. They are both technologies, yes, but email was more of an addition to communications while bitcoin rips the foundations out of the financial system as we know it. I’d like to hear your view on that 
@_date: 2018-06-16 19:05:32
I mean.. why do you think companies like vanguard are so successful? People don’t even understand investing in stocks. The technological barriers of understanding bitcoin are pretty high.. they can maybe understand the theory after a lot of explaining but even then there is no obvious benefit for the normal person. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:09:26
Appreciate your view. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:30:00
"timed your entry badly" is a really sensitive way to say "jumped on the bandwagon late"
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:50:33
to be honest this subreddit has done downhill drastically. It used to be about the technology, then all it turned in to was a get rich quick scheme. There is a reason that people have a distaste for bitcoin and it's not due to technological reasons...
@_date: 2019-02-08 05:03:41
stop with viewpoints that don't match OUR narrative &gt;:(
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:38:44
Do you think that there are as many people interacting with bitcoin as the internet in the 90's? Honest question because I see two VERY different numbers in my head...
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:57:30
You can earn big sums of money based on what? Speculation? The true value of bitcoin is the technology under it... yet you  bastardize the truth in order to pump up its value... "Hey guys, it's the new internet! You can make a LOT OF MONEY BUY BUY BUY HOLD HOLD HOLD" 
give me a break...
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:19:28
Users on the internet
current statistics on blockchain WALLETS
I think you will see there is a large discrepancy in your comparison. Wallet growth is starting to plateau a bit, while internet usage doubled. If anything I suppose we can call this 1995~ish, but to make it an accurate comparison user adoption would have to double or MORE yearly for the next 5 years
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:18:26
20% of e-commerce sites... which make up what percentage of sales? That statistic doesn't mean much on its own if those 20% make .0000001% of the sales
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:49:44
You are assuming that the idea HAS to "cross the chasm"...
is there a possible future in which bitcoin does not "cross the chasm"? If this is not a possibility to you, are you telling me you can predict the future?
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:27:26
wtf are you talking about
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:46:43
right, and we are talking WALLETS not users. Doesn't comparing bitcoin adoption to the internet seem a bit far fetched when you look at the statistics?
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:25:35
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:59:46
look at the last year... looks like its tailing off to me, not growing exponentially as expected. I can mark it on the image if you really can't see what I'm saying. It's also important to note this is wallet counts
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:03:06
Might as well buy penny stocks
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:14:12
Read the whitepaper, it really is a better way of doing transactions online.
This coming from somebody who owns 0 bitcoin and who will continue owning 0 bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:32:22
Tons of older guys watch these streams, that dude is just wrong
@_date: 2018-07-02 01:13:28
what makes you say that
@_date: 2018-07-01 21:52:57
That's why they spend all their time posting on this sub. Finally something they dont need to know shit about and get attention 
@_date: 2018-07-01 21:56:54
So what if bitcoin crashes? Abd doesn't recover? You are comfortable with this expectation?
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:16:16
I mean do you really have to worry about your bitcoins being seized if you can't buy anything with them
@_date: 2018-07-01 21:54:44
So what's your predictions 
@_date: 2018-07-02 03:37:29
It is as played out as bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-01 21:51:40
Idk bro tulips were an emerging asset at one point 
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:30:07
I don’t think you understand sheep 
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:21:19
Or maybe a bank is more well equipped to protect your money than your home solution.
Or it could not be.
A good thought experiment
