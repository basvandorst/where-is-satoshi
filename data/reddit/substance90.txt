It literally works the opposite way. If enough people say it, they’ll convince others to invest more and that’ll inflate the price.
@_date: 2019-03-21 14:56:49
The general rule of thumb here is – do your analysis based on some indicators, make some conclusion based on that and then finally do the opposite thing. If you do the thing that seems logical, the market will fuck you every time. :)

Why do all BTC ATMs look so scammy? Like a flashing slot machine in a cheap casino.

But how can he afford gas in the current bear market?
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:00:01
Why are you assuming he didn't sell the BTC for fiat immediately?

How would he buy the Porsche if he's HODLing?

Hello internet? This is China. We ban Bitcoin.

It hasn't on my chart.
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:12:38
Just because you guys in the US had two shitty election candidates and at the time WikiLeaks had dirt only on one of them, doesn't mean that Assange chose a "side" or that suddenly suppressing whistle blowers is okay.

Sell each time there's a local high and then buy when it dips again. It's called day trading. It's a sure way to go broke if you don't know what you're doing.

Hear hear

Definitely somewhere between Anxiety and Denial.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:26:48
Looks like someone bought the dip.
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:54:11
Lol, I used to routinely spend double digit amounts of BTC on weed in 2012/13. Back then it was money, not an investment.

I consider all these a part of blockchain technology. If you strip out the proof of work and the difficulty adjustment and the mining etc., all you have is a single linked list, a data structure as old as object oriented programming languages.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:14:56
That. As long as you know that, there's nothing to worry about. The price will rebound.
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:33:13
You could sell some and then when you see how the trend really is, you either sell the rest or buy again. You spread the risk out that way.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:59:58
"Hero internet, uh yes, this is China. We ban Bitcoin!"
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:21:25
That's why the difficulty readjusts. When the miners who use expensive electricity shut down, the total hashrate goes down and the difficulty as well, thus increasing profitability again.
@_date: 2018-11-29 11:30:47
I can remember the 2013 crash from like $50 to $30. Man, that was so annoying.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:24:54
You do realize that since people are panic selling that means someone is buying? You can't have sellers without buyers.

WTF, how is this FUD? This is standard practice in trading. When you're anticipating a high point you don't immediately exit your whole position. That would be like playing the roulette.
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:44:49
you only lose if you sell **cheaper than what you paid initially**

It makes me cringe even more when some idiot explains shit in hindsight, like "why the windows phone failed". Yeah, no shit, everything is obvious in hindsight.

Theoretically you could have a blockchain without encryption but it would be pretty much useless. It would be a sort of really slow database where you can only append stuff to the end.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:54:46
Let me tell you a little story, that keeps repeating in my life. My first BTC investments were when the price was hovering around 8-10 USD. I would for example buy 20 BTC for $200 and them sell them for $280 making small profits here and there. I would always quit after every crash instead of HODLing and I would always regret it afterwards. Hell, the 2013 crash was insane and nerve wracking. In hindsight I was obviously foolish to sell my "overpriced" BTC bought at $170-180 a piece.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:28:23
I hope you have enough BTC left for fuel. I imagine it consumes fuel like a WW2 tank.
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:49:50
Like take bubble baths and stuff?
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:15:32
Plan A is to HODL, plan B is to buy even more at this Black Friday sale.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:30:11
You could sell your altcoins (even at a loss) if you have any. I sold all my XRP and XLM to buy the BTC dip.

Here's whay I don't understand about Bart formations. How does the whale sell at all exchanges at the same time?
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:08:28
To be fair crypto more than any other market is traded almost exclusively on psychology of which wishful thinking is a part :)
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:01:57
Yes, I think you're one of the few.
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:16:28
If there's a chance you might lose everything, then you're doing investing wrong.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:18:00
To be fair, blockchain *is* the most interesting aspect of Bitcoin. I agree with your other points though.
@_date: 2019-01-10 09:33:00
(Has had enough and quietly heads to FOREX and Stocks...)
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:49:05
Lol, yeah, pretty much. I wonder if things would have been different if BCH was more of a community project and not a leader-led project. Sometimes big-ego personalities get in the way.
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:08:57
That's the most sensible thing I've read here since the current crash started.
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:57:03
Yeah but that's not how trading works. You sell on time and then you can buy even more at the bottom for the next swing up.
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:41:31
People "expecting" the price to plunge and spreading FUD on social media.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:19:17
Wtf, which country is that?
@_date: 2018-11-21 10:24:08
I don't think anyone would dispute that. That's how I got to Bitcoin in 2012 when a gram of weed costed a little over 1 BTC on the darknet. At that point no one saw Bitcoin as an investment. It was just money.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:17:08
Not saying Deutsche Bank aren't assholes but since when is zerohedge a credible source?
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:58:44
This guy lost all credibility a long time ago.
@_date: 2019-05-15 11:23:17
Zero regrets. I bought the BTC over the counter, used it as money, got what I ordered.
@_date: 2019-05-15 12:15:38
If you start thinking that way, life will be full of regrets — not getting an apartment in Berlin in 1990, not buying Microsoft stock in 1985, not buying Apple stock in 2000, not patenting that random idea you had 20 years ago which just now came to market etc...
@_date: 2019-05-15 11:16:46
You're the one who's trading so it's your income on which you should pay taxes in the country where you live at least 6 months and 1 day per year.
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:16:11
I never regret things that are only obvious in hindsight. Back in 2012 no one thought Bitcoin is going anywhere value wise. Everyone was just mildly amused that it reached $10 but mainly it was a way to obtain things in an faster pseudo-anonymous way than fiat money, aka. buy weed.
@_date: 2019-05-15 11:14:21
Probably not the best decision to buy at the top. Major dip incoming.
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:10:16
No one knows. You just observe the chart indicators and if they show an uptrend you enter a long position, like any other stock.
I don't care if it reaches 100k. If I buy at 2000 and then sell at 2200, that's profit for the day.
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:43:44
Yeah, I get what you're saying. You can have it your way in your thread but thankfully the rest of the world (society and politics) doesn't work that way. It did use to work that way in the past, as recently as 30 years ago in some parts of the world but thankfully that's behind us now.
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:33:32
If you were trading, you did nothing wrong. If you are looking to invest long term on the other hand, than this was stupid indeed. When trading you consider each trade separately - if you buy at 3k and sell at 4k, then later buy at 5k and sell at 6k, that’s 2k profit. Separate your emotions from the trading.
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:03:25
Ever heard of the open source movement? Or I don't know, the Firefox browser?
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:15:31
You and I wouldn't know these projects because they aren't coins that you can buy. Many governments and big institutions are experimenting with moving data storage to blockchains. You're gonna be hearing much more about these projects in the coming 2 to 3 years. All everyone currently knows is coins as in "money" because that was the most obvious and earliest use case for the technology but it's definitely not the only viable one.
There's no technical reason that your election blockchain has to be limited at 80 bytes per transaction and 500K transactions per day just because Bitcoin randomly chose this limitation.
@_date: 2019-05-15 11:00:37
Bought 20 grams of weed in 2012 for about 20 BTC. Back then Bitcoin was just money, not an "investment".
@_date: 2019-05-01 08:24:08
I think the point of the artwork is precisely that Bitcoin by itself isn't enough to make you free.

Excuse my anecdotal argument but most of my friends and I are quite left leaning, and still we're all into crypto.
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:04:44
40% on what? You need to make a profit to have taxes on it. If they bought BTC and are hodling, there isn't any capital gains tax.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:13:16
F\*\*\* these guys and their fake Bitcoins (BSV and ABC). There is no room for big egos and assholes in crypto!
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:00:57
Not the most credible source though. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:09:58
Whales definitely are dangerous if Bitcoin is to be used as money and not "gold". Because the crypto market is unregulated whales can make manipulating moves that would be illegal or at least worthy of investigation in normal stock markets.
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:07:29
That's probably the biggest nonsense I've read here lately.
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:28:24
Now. But not all in. Invest sparingly when there are signs of local bottoms, like over the past weekend.
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:40:00
I'm pretty sure economics and nature are not like yin and yang. Economics is a human invention. Now science and nature you might call yin and yang.
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:24:38
This was after the first major parabolic rally. I'd say 2013 is the turning point where BTC stopped being money and became an investment for better or worse.
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:58:23
It's gonna be a pretty big crash too, seeing as it's been overbought for almost a week yet keeps growing. Soon the bull trap will spring.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:45:14
How accurate is it
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:41:11
Invest 50k and start a business with the rest.

This is a horrible strategy and you are going to get burned. Only use your own cash and small amounts that you can affors to lose!
@_date: 2018-12-25 08:54:41
I agree with you about  AI, but I still find it really off-putting  when you warn people upfront not to express dissenting opinion. It's just not very inviting and conversion inducing.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:11:41
Don't really care. As long as there are price movements, money can be made. Long term, BTC is not ideal as money due to technical reasons but blockchain is definitely here to stay.
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:13:45
Kraken and LocalBitcoins if it's available in your country.
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:21:11
Time for a healthy retrace. I’ve already shorted BTC and ETH.
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:07:31
This post misses the point very badly - Bitcoin is not about getting rich. It's about freedom from government and banks.
@_date: 2018-12-09 16:02:27
Funny thing is, these banknotes cost 3€ a piece.
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:09:09

Yeah, no. I don't think so.

@_date: 2018-12-07 13:15:29
You saw the light! I always switch back to BTC but I did make a hefty profit on BCH right before the hard fork.

Where's the one for chilled-out selling and then rebuying even more at the bottom?
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:07:58
There is no correct price, it's just a trading term for big price movements.
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:37:42
Bought. In 2012 CPUs already couldn't compete anymore and GPUs weren't very profitable at the $10-15 price point. The first ASICs were on the horizon and if I regret anything, it's that I didn't invest in the first Avalon miner. $1300 looked nearly impossible on a student budget though...

You don't really have much choice if you trade. You need to be be able to move quickly.
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:56:56
That is the main benefit of Bitcoin to people who are here for ideological reasons. The actual reason Bitcoin is rallying is everyone else wants a lambo.
