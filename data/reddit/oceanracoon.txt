Uh, isn't that exactly what money does? Gives you the freedom and time to do whatever you want? You can't travel the world, learn something new, or spend time with your family if you're chained to your job working all hours, get one week of holidays a year, and are too tired when you come home to spend quality time with your kids.
That sounds like something someone with money would say, without realizing the value of it to people who have none.

Still seems unnecessary, why gamble with 7 million on such a risky venture like Bitcoin, when you can take it out and put into much sounder investments. Even if you can take the hit. Who knows, maybe it'll bounce back and pay off

Buy high, sell never

Oh man, why didn't you sell at 7 million? What more were you hoping for? That's enough to retire on and gloatingly post in about being a Bitcoin success story

He's talking about an interest in cheap electricity leading to increasing both the investment in and the amount of renewable energy source projects, you insufferably pretentious and condescending twat, not that the actual electricity McAfee would be using is going to a great place. Idiot. You were an ass to that guy for no reason.
