Depends on your bank/card. Most accounts have around a $1500 but some people can pull out a lot more. Its the same thing, but people want to make special pleading because its BTC. And its not a statement of badassery to suggest that if you are worried about getting jacked you have a means to defend yourself. I would have suggested a gun, but not everyone can get those everywhere. 
As far as fantasies go, I think stabbing a mugger is a much more realistic scenario than someone kidnapping, torturing, and then murdering you for your crypto.

Im not saying BTC can't do good things for the world, but the community often ignores the elephant in the room.
Its the official currency of the black market. Its going to be a race between the communities ability to legitimize and law enforcement's ability to trace the coins to the source.  
Only one thing can save the world, free energy. And thats not going to happen while we still worship money, fiat or otherwise

@_date: 2017-03-13 15:00:38
I remember 4 years ago everyone was touting Bitcoin as the only true free trade currency, one that responded to market demands. Im not saying your argument doesnt have merit, but it asks that we defer to a select group of people about the direction the market takes. Kinda like a bank. 
And lets be honest, 2-5% transaction fees make the currency unusable to everyone except the dealers  
@_date: 2017-03-11 22:20:54
My only regret was not having the money to buy up those panic shares
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:19:32
Of course the dealers are happy, they are making money that is increasing in value and the only transactions they are paying for are for outbound coin.
My point has nothing to do with how content people are with the status quo. Its that sooner or later the anonymity train will leave the station and that will effectively end the use of BTC in DNMs. 
Tumbling chicanery may keep it going long enough to get the money out, but the price will crash. Has nothing to do with the fork or the technical efficiency of one code over the other. 
The micro-transaction argument is to illustrate the extremely limited spending capability of the coin as well. All forms of currency go in some way or another to the black market, digital or analogue. But if your currency is primarily propped up by a black market, loss of said market would be devastating to the currency. 
Given that this tracing of the blockchain is a sheer inevitability  (5mo or 5y, cant even guess) people with large stake in it will continue to push for decisions that increase their power of their share. Again, no altruists in this game.

@_date: 2017-03-13 19:07:53
Ah, but you see you are referencing other intermediaries to change BTC into spendable currency and vice versa. I agree, less illegal activity would serve to make it a more legitimate currency, but thats not the nature of things atm.
Because the list of things you can use BTC on is so very small right now. Your options are to trade it for drugs, trade it for spendable currency, or hodl. The currency is the product unto itself, its sale and acquisition being basically the whole market for that. And if you are in the business of brokering exchanges, shit is pretty perfect for you right now.
You sit back and make money off of people just trading the currency. Of course the model doesn't have to change. 
Drug dealers are ok with paying 5-10% because its way cheaper than traditional laundering, drug users are on with paying 5-10% because they have an unadulterated menu and don't have to worry about the risks people used to be forced to take. 
Outside of that demographic its very hard to imagine people willing to pay 10% on top of every legitimate purchase, and yeah, you can get that down to around 2-6% if you are clever, but thats still a ridiculous premise for solvency. 
Btw, kudos for maintaining an adult conversation about this. Its something that should be recognized.
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:26:20
Wow, fell onto some prepared rhetoric there it sounds like. No, I bring up the black market because for all the claims to BTC being a legit currency it would not be thriving if it weren't for it being the dominate online black market currency.  Law enforcement starts tracing the chain to bust people and the currency is near useless overnight. 
If you think they aren't working on it, you are out of your mind.  Also saying that its no big deal that dealers use it is living in pure denial of the finite lifespan of BTC. 
Ive seen the games both sides play. One side spams outlandish claims, the other puts on the shiny happy face and denies problems exist.
It comes down to control, and through it, money. Look, i just said people will try to make more money and act in their personal interest. Agree to disagree then?
@_date: 2017-03-01 21:50:58
War on Drugs.... come on, aren't we paying attention to ALL the factors? Btc is the primary currency for drug dealers and yet it would seem no one on the legitimate side wants to acknowledge or discuss the very real stake the black market has in BTC. Seems a strange omission to me
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:39:18
That's an interesting take on it.  The idea that millions in drug money could be traced to the source and that won't impact the price...  just can't wrap my head around it. Not without having enough legitimate market presence anyway. 
But what is the market presence? How it trades against other currency? Inflation based on speculative growth? What can you buy with BTC? Sure there are some places starting to accept it, but how do those transactions stack against traditional fiat? You buy in at over-market, your transaction costs you over-market because of fees, and you get the same product. 
And at the end of the day you have two groups of people telling everyone they know what the market needs, and i sincerely doubt either is thinking about whats best for the end user. Which is what makes BTC a stock more than a currency
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:53:11
Ok. So the primary use of BTC is speculative investing, the secondary being the black market... I'm trying to select my words here.
What would be the intrinsic value of bitcoin without anonymity? Speculative investing on what? That it just keeps getting more expensive because demand keeps increasing? So you have people buying in while hoarders try to control the supply, because ask DeBers why diamonds cost so much.
As a currency to spend bitcoin is retarded because of the ridiculous nature of point based transactions, you could never buy anything at face value. And yes, some savvy institutions will start accepting Internet money to hoard as an investment. But percent to total, in terms of currency in exchange fir an actual product, what would you say dominates the market?
So if the bottom dropped out on those millions of dollars, what is going to maintain the price point? Paypal transactions? Cool, you would still have to convince people to go to the trouble of buying coin, at semi-flat percentage rates over-market value to make transactions they could make with a bank card.
Bitcoin grows through speculation.
The only real solvency is drugs right now. If it can't be spent there is nothing to speculate against. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:44:19
Also, if the primary demand isnt for black market goods, what would you say the demand is for? Speculative holding?

The fork debate doesnt help. The purity arguments don't help. The Church of Bitcoin calling all other altcoins false idols doesnt help. If you were in ETH you just saw a nice tripling of your money. And a lot of people seem to think its a form of heresy to chase profits. 
Maybe its because a group of grown adults can't stop this childish 00's era message board bullshit and its undermining peoples confidence. 
Sure, I'm full of shit, granted. But when every fluctuation in the price leads people to stand on rhetoric every single time, its not an honest dialog, and it definitely isn't the proper way to speculate for investing.

Look, I'm not in the debate, Im vested because drug dealers use the currency, so whichever way the debate lands, Im solid.
But it just seems to me, there are no altruists  in this game. Not core, not BU, not the drug dealers. 
The people who are making shit tons of money now dont want to open it up for other people to get in on their chunk of the market. I see a lot of core decry regulatory practices while demanding they be able to make their own regulations about whats good for the market.
Again, not in the debate, just what it appears to be. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:02:37
Given the nature of the markets it would be hard to get an accurate estimate of how much is floating around in DNM limbo. We have the Silk Road bust and the various exit scams around the 500 - 700 mark that estimated over $100m, my point is that the DNM claim on BTC is more significant than whether or not the fork comes. As soon as alphabet agencies can track it back to the source it becomes worthless because no one can safely get their ill gotten gains out. 
It's an aspect of the conversation that goes mostly unspoken and it seems so strange to me given that people want this to be a real currency.

You could transfer it to blockchain, but if you are doing anything shady, just leave it in coinbase. Are you looking for short term or long term investing? You need to calculate your adjusted BTC cost (actual cost/actual btc) and that is your break even sale point (after adjusting again for fees)
Short term, watch the market and be ready to sell. Long term, just sit

I have a friend wanting to get in now. He asked me what he should get and how much of. I told him if he wants a quick 10% flip he needs to wait for the next dip.  
I then told him that if he wants to just drop the money and let it grow, just drop it in BTC and check it after the new year.
Then I explained to him that the right time is right now. There is so much money in crypto that regardless of what happens to BTC in the long run, you can make money in this like the 80s NYSE. 
When you take a hit, don't sell for the loss. Consider that money to be in a coma, the penalty box, in county lockup. Whatever analogy you like that makes you leave the coins alone.
In fact (pending a quick glance at the news) that is the time to throw *more* money at the market.
