if for developed countries it is already quite popular and many have used bitcoin for their needs, but in countries that are still lacking facilities still do not understand what crypto is, and in some countries there are also restrictions on cryptos.

yes that is right and bitcoin has already have a good control over the crypto market, and i think a lot of reasons are there for that, but i think that he major reason is that bitcoin is first crypto currency created, and still people are taking interest in bitcoin.

Altcoin is good yes but I'm not too sure if anything will be able to surpass bitcoin at the moment tbh. Bitcoin is the gold standard of cryptocurrency,

we try to analyse both Bitcoin and altcoin ,Bitcoin is strong in the market and it have full control in the market. When Bitcoin price falls down altcoin value also depriciates so according to my point of view Bitcoin will remain at the top and be the king of the crypto world . In future we can  predict  that there will be more altcoins  and it may dominate after the blockchain technology is matured.

Yeah, I agree that people need stability of prices. For ex., someone exchanged 6500$ for BTC and in 1-2 weeks it
	will be 6850$ in BTC value.
