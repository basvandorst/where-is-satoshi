What would you say is his greatest accomplishment?
Alienating the majority of congress and the nation’s strategic international partnerships?
Spending half his day watching tv during his “executive time”?
Preventing all domestic airline fatalities since taking office?

He is really good at sleazy self promotion. For instance when he used to call reporters pretending to be a publicist to get his name in the news back in the 80s.
But that is not a sign of intelligence. 
If you can’t recognize that he is in way over his head as a world leader, I question your judgment.

How is studying charts obsessively looking for patterns and then making highly stressful and difficult decisions while maintaining extreme discipline not “actual work”?

How is this less relevant than all the stupid memes you let stand?
It was a commentary on how hard it is to destroy a decentralized network and a metaphor for bitcoin.
Maybe you just didn’t get it...

It’s so simple... just sell high and buy low.

I’m sorry I thought you meant you lost the 30% when you sold the btc thru coinbase... not from the transfer from CBpro.
If that’s the case then I’m not sure what happened. Are you sure you didn’t leave a balance on Pro? 
Maybe ask coinbase support. They are easy to work with /s
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:25:00
No the transfers are free and instantaneous between the two.

Lol, most smart and normal people recognize his bullshit anytime he opens his mouth... including the vast majority of of the population of New York who’ve been enduring it for decades.
I forgive you though. It’s notoriously difficult for human beings to recognize and eventually admit that they’ve been swindled.

You should have left it on coinbase pro and sold it there. You would have saved those fees.
Coinbase is a brokerage which charges a fee to place your order whereas Pro is an exchange where you can place your own for a small ticket charge or free if you add liquidity to the market.

*note*... you would have gotten a proportionate share of a 7.2 billion dollar settlement if you had. 
Not sure how many cents on the dollar that would have been, but, even as a personal bitcoin believer, that is a pretty key difference in the risk profile.

I’m not very technically minded so someone please correct me if I am wrong on any details, but my understanding is that the private key generated will always produce the public key when sha-256 is applied to it. 
So it doesn’t matter if a specific public address is on the block chain already or not. Once it gets recorded on the blockchain by receiving its first transaction, that private key will work just fine.

Index funds have no “decades of experience”. They are tied to the value of an index, ie the S&amp;P 500. There’s no person or entity in control.
Surely a master trader who can clearly spot a bottom and buy with confidence, doubling his bitcoin as easily as bending down to pick a dollar up off the street would be able to distinguish between an index fund and a managed mutual fund.
Master financial guru indeed.

And the fact that index funds out perform the majority of managed funds over time suggests that your strategy is a loser.

I agree with you that investing in index funds is the best way to go.  
But not because the worlds smartest investors and traders have set the perfect price and there is no way someone outside of Wall Street could do better.
Asset valuation is an imprecise science at best and subject to emotions and a whole host of other externalities.
Most managed funds don’t outperform the index funds on a consistent basis.
Edit: I meant the best way to go for stock market investing. I’m all for buying bitcoin for the baby!

Well constructed prose, but I don’t know how we can proclaim the end of the bear market after 24 hours of buying.
I guess we can add this “satoshi cycle” to the blockchain. It’s verified.
Btw, I’m long... just playing devils advocate.
