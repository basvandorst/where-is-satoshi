Wow, more than 400 GBP spread. That's 6% loss by just buying and selling.

66 BTC is less than 4% of the 1800 BTC that are mined every day. I doubt it would have any significant impact.

You missed many local minima. But probably I am not really understanding what you plot.
EDIT: Ok, maybe I get it. You plot the lowest point after each all-time high. The last bit is confusing because you plot points on the orange curve even though there was no new all-time high.
EDIT2: Still makes no sense. I think you just pick some random local minima while excluding others.

Had some requests once in a while whether I really want to make the transactions. But otherwise it always went through.
