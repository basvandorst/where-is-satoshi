He should have significantly more left than that -- see these reedit threads:

that's probably true - hah. Hate to use a cliche, but easy come, easy go. Won't lose sleep over it, so long as I don't do the math :)

The main variable of control is the odds, and thus the payout. The "standard" is to play at 49.5% which yields a 2x return. I was doing that with super-small bets, at 32 or 64 satoshi - almost impossible to 'lose' but also takes forever to make any real returns. Then I tried 66% with only a 1.5x return, which on the face of it is less lucrative, but more likely to hit -- except when it doesn't, which is what happened to me when I got distracted by the amounts I was doubling up.

Or it is what it is: a guy with a lot of bitcoin playing a game, and-- contrary to his previous experiences-- not winning.
Why would anyone bother to try to 'launder' bitcoin in such a silly and public manner -- the rolls were being watched by at least 70 people (those who were in chat.)

As an FYI: this isn't a marketing strategy, nor a sob story-- it happened earlier today, and I was there witnessing it. This was written based on my observations and going back over the chatroom commentary. Prior to writing, I asked Nakowa/whodunit if he was ok with my posting a news item about it -- because it was pretty exciting to be a spectator.

Added an addendum, following my own misadventure. 
In a small scale way, I can understand Nak's 'gaming mentality' - having blown the sum he gifted on those watching him play in just a few minutes. Online, it's easy to get caught up in the bigger and bigger bets on rolls, when you feel like you have a greater purse to draw from -- even if before you were particularly careful. I had played for days starting with the equivalent of 90 US cents, building it up to .006 with small, deliberate bets. Then, following the sudden 'fortune,' started rolling like mad -- before I realized it, I was no longer betting pennies' worth, but half my holdings at a time and managed to get wiped out in two rolls! Them's the breaks, and everyone, no matter how normally sensible can lose sight of reason in the excitement.

You do understand how Bitcoin was initially generated and that Nakowa already had a history of winning big, right? He has deep pockets and was off his game/luck/etc.
