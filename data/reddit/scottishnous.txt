An influx of funds from folks who want to buy at perceived low prices would certainly help raise the price this weekend.  But that's not going to happen now.  Many of those watching the recent dips who thought it might be a good time to get in are going to have to wait.  Tons of folks who wanted to get in a few days ago (and initiated wire transfers) are also probably going to have to wait until Tuesday for their funds to become available.  Given that we can expect an unusually depressed amount of funds from a large number of folks who might have wanted or tried to get in, yes, I expect the price to drop.

For information on Golden Week, see here: 
The main link takes you to Mt. Gox's announcement concerning Golden Week last year.
I'm inclined to think that it's against my interests to share this, but whatever.  Enjoy the fun ride this weekend.

I'm not giving an explanation of the price decline.  I'm pointing out that money available to boost the price is going to be limited for days.

Yes, I realize the demo is behind a registration wall, but it's worth it to enter some crap and watch it.  You can check this out if you don't want to watch the demo:

Well... suppose you wired money yesterday or the day before?  When do you think you'll get it into Mt. Gox?  Banks in Japan went offline over 12 hours ago.

Some ridiculous spamscam advertising the sale of bitcoins at around 1% of their current price.

That's why I said "think hard".  It all depends on your situation and what your expectations are.

Holy Moly.  That was a generous tip.

I get one comment, and no upvotes on a link to the best BTC wallet ever.   Oh well, thanks for reading! =)

I much preferred the original v2 to this one.  In the original, the yellow ring is smaller than the orange, and the outer rings are set closer to one another.  That was the way to go, IMO.  This one looks off to me.

WTF is this shit. Reported.

There are many obvious reasons.  Don't be so obtuse.
