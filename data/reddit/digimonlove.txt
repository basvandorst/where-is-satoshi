Better get out your master ball, yo.

Pff, gmax is getting so goddamn grumpy these days. I wish he would stop giving bitcoin a bad name and just leave the community.

Someone told me $800 was a fire sale. Unfortunately, I listened...
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:31:40
Yeah, now it's common, but at the time I'm pretty sure no one had developed proof of work anti-fragile hash functions like sha256.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:20:41
You've fallen victim to the double-spending attacks going around the Bitcoin network.
Backup your coins in a paper wallet next time.
@_date: 2014-03-29 04:26:17


hahahahaha... Yeah right.
@_date: 2014-03-30 02:36:55
That's what they told me when I bought in at 800...

The great thing about all of this is how many early adopters like yourself got wiped out. There was basically no way /all/ of you could have cashed out without crashing the market, and all of that "old money" sitting around made the market way too unstable.
Almost 1 million coin destroyed (around 7% of total supply) just makes the rest of us that much richer.
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:56:14
Yeah, just sold everything... Jesus this is crazy. Can't take it.
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:02:59
Didn't have SHA256. Wasn't as good as bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:06:56
That's a great idea. I think it's time we move our protest to the DEVS and force them to give us our coins back.
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:12:15
Yeah, 40-80k a coin is not far-fetched at all.
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:25:32
Got out a while ago. Get out before everything implodes around us. It's likely that the gox issue is going to trigger a solvency crisis at another exchange. When that happens expect sub-100 prices across the board.
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:59:59
Balance sheet issue. If gox opens back up, there's going to be a lot of selling on other exchanges because of the price delta. 
If an exchange doesn't have the fiat immediately available to handle the outflow, BAM, another solvency issue.
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:27:41
Wow, gross. Even if the comment removal was necessary, the way he's handling the situation is *terrible*.

Welcome to the club.

I hate idiots like you coming in with all these lame predictions. 
Bitcoin CAN be reserve currency because it's deflationary. It's going to get rid of credit cards, credit companies, banks, everything. There's literally not a piece of the world economy that isn't going to be powered by bitcoin.
Who cares about silver remittances? We're on the tip of digital finance, all powered by a massive distributed database that anyone in the world will be able to carry in their pocket.
Dollar will be defunct. Euro will be defunct. Yen will be defunct. Relics from the "fiat age." We're seeing the most transformative technology since the Internet. It's Bitcoin, it's big, but it's going to be HUGE.
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:40:24
Andreas, I've been following you for years and I am VERY disappointed at this. Don't associate yourself with joke currency. Don't cheapen the bitcoin brand.
Stop this bullshit or get out of our community.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:45:42
Everything. Was drawing on my gox account for rent.
Not sure what I'm going to do after the first of the month.

@_date: 2014-03-01 23:19:59
Yeah, a friend of mine does this all the time at Bitcoin establishments.
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:26:05


Uh, duh, *bitcoin* didn't exist yet..
@_date: 2014-01-18 05:46:33


Sigh, when will these idiots learn... Would you tell someone you had $3.5 million dollars? No. This guy is going to have friends/family/coworkers begging for money and an otherwise ruined life once bitcoin explodes.
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:15:21
Yep, same thing here. Guessing they just got hacked on top of all of this.
Glad I pulled out of this shitstorm last night.
@_date: 2014-01-01 15:37:06
When government collapses and you are all alone think of this post. Think of your ignorance. When bitcoin was fresh on the market, people laughed.
You're laughing now.

Yes the food and gun are going to power the bitcoin of revolution up to and including the greatest thing the world has ever seen the power of HASHING OF MONEY

Uh, just make sure you generate your own pub/priv key pair and you're golden. Send whatever coin you have left to the wallet address and *BAM* ain't no hacker gonna get through that since the keys were never online.
Also don't trust 3rd parties without 2-factor auth, you're basically asking to get pwned out there kid.
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:30:04
Wasn't Satoshi a genius for picking the algorithm with this exact property? I wonder what other gems are lurking in the bitcoin source code waiting to be discovered.
@_date: 2014-03-30 02:34:54

This guy is going to prison. Too bad it's Japanese prison and not Cambodia.
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:42:50
Exactly. Yeah, that's what I mean: the Blockchain can't go down because the price is pretty resistant to failures of core infrastructure. People are just waiting for the Blockchain to return before transferring coin between one another. This community is amazing.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:09:28
oh my god you guys have 15 million bitcoins thank god
listen the gox situation is really bad out there. i can't pay my rent, a lot of people lost a lot of money.
please take 700k of those coins and make it all right
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:36:04
My cousin is a program manager at Amazon. The Overstock thing caught Amazon's attention, for sure.
A couple of the lower-level engineers scraped together a version of their payment gateway that uses bitcoin. Unfortunately, there's no will to fund the integration back into their main line.
Vendor communication with Amazon will really help them get online with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:53:23
I doubt any of the fine gentlemen who launched this community left any sizable amount of coin in gox.
No, I'm talking about idiots like sdfjkhe. People who CPU / GPU mined on their parents dime. People who got into bitcoin not for the wonderful community or the cool technology, but only for greed.
It's an intelligence filter. Dumb money loses. What's not to like about that?
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:51:54
Back everything up. Get your coins into a paper wallet. Now.
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:23:30
japan please i lost my rent money not sure what im going to do next month :( please get our coins back
im begging you
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:47:17
Exploit in the Bitcoin protocol where you can spoof transactions that haven't appeared in the blockchain yet.
Backup your coin in a paper wallet and **don't** run a live client until further notice. People are losing a lot of money out there.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:14:59
Thanks a lot gox.
Vietnam? Shut out before we even got in. US? Senators are calling for our ban. Japan? Working on new regulations.

Yeah, damn, sell some coin and take the wifey to the Bahamas for the year. Jesus.

So hackers are in control of a majority of the hashing power of the network right now? Fuck.
@_date: 2014-03-19 02:07:18
Wow, I didn't realize the entire blockchain could go down. Glad people like Andreas have stepped up into Satoshi's shoes to fix the issue.
Surprised BTC didn't tank super low though. Damn this currency is amazingly resilient to even core infrastructure failing.

Time is controlled by Bitcoin nodes, not the miners.

@_date: 2013-12-24 17:33:21
Okay. What's a "BitPro" ?
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:56:00
Protip: In the professional services industry, websites are optional (you can get around by word-of-mouth alone.) Focus on building business relationships in the SoCal area first.

@_date: 2013-12-24 16:12:43
Most respected analysts are predicting a slow decline into the 300s over the next few months, which will set the stage for the next bull run.
If that bull run fails to materialize, however, the decline will continue and most players will exit the market.
It's time to consider alternative currencies (like QRK) and the growth potential in other formulations of the Bitcoin model.
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:51:13
Uh, excuse me. China is still crazy for bitcoins - they'll just need to buy it from the black market. They have a HUGE black market over there.
The underground demand for coins will push the price up to 8000 yuan and higher.
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:15:25
Stochastic model that estimates required Bitcoin on-hand balances for remittance in the Chinese black market vs current asks on stamp/gox/btchina.
(Assuming adoption in the black market, of course.)
It's Silk Road on a grand scale, my friend.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:09:33
Ah, okay? I just got here from Trying to figure all of this out.
So, I hear a paper wallet is the more secure way to store your bitcoin? How do I get bitcoin in the first place to put on it? (Can I just mine it onto the paper wallet?)
