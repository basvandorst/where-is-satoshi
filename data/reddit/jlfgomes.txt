This is my approach as well. Buy little by little just when price is good and you have some throwaway money around.

But terrorists already use the internet, for things like coordination and recruiting. Remember Snowden and the NSA?

So you buy them to support the artist, or as souvenirs. When you want to listen to music, you want the convenience of having access to whatever you want whenever you want on your smartphone. I collect vinyl records, but they're mostly memorabilia from bands I like.

"The Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010 expired at the end of the 2009–2010 Congress without receiving a vote from either chamber."
It's not online. It hasn't even gone to vote. Plus, how exactly do they plan to pull this off from an engineering standpoint? I can see how you can kill the entire internet for the United States, but for the entire world? Do you know how the internet works?

What the fuck. In the EXTREMELY UNLIKELY scenario where this happens, it will cripple the entire global economy, US's included. This is a suicide move. Why would they do this unless... Oh, right. Trump.

What labels? Most small artists I know (which are the vast majority of working musicians) are independent and self-managed. Plus, many big artists like Radiohead, Foo Fighters are also self-managed in the sense that they own their own labels and managing agencies. Record companies are much smaller nowadays and work as "modeling agencies" in the sense that any artist can sign a deal with them as long as they have the money for it. This is how they make some money today. I know this guy that paid $100,000 for a deal with Universal in Brazil. The guy's rich and could afford it. Universal will record and distribute his music for a large percentage of profits. There's been major touring artists in Brazil with record contracts that give ALL profits to labels for 2-3 years - they'll support you during that time and drop you afterwards unless you're immensely successful. This is widely known by the industry; some folks choose this path, others don't. There's not a lot of advantage for artists that have record deals nowadays, and record companies will even warn you about the risks.

HOW EXACTLY would banks shut down the internet? It's decentralized. Plus, they'd be sabotaging themselves, since a lot of banking nowadays is done via the internet. No internet will cripple many other services as well, not just banks.

Napster got slaughtered. The consumers won. When was the last time you bought a record?
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:45:38
Unless you're the Foo Fighters and your song has been on the radio for 10+ years, no, you're not making much money from selling/streaming your music. The bulk of your money if you're an average musician like me is made from playing concerts and selling merch. Records are considered more of a merch item nowadays since people buy them to support you and they just get tossed somewhere, because listening on streaming services is just way more convenient. I've spend tons of money pressing CDs just to have them lying around as junk. Even shirts and coffee mugs sell better.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:54:18
Their argument is basically to say that it's worthless since it's not backed by national economies and whatnot. Also, that it's used to commit crimes. Like the US Dollar isn't.

I think it's safe to assume that blockchain technology will stick around. Not sure if Bitcoin/Ethereum/Whatever will still be in use in 10-15 years, but the technology is pretty amazing.

We agree on every point, especially on the "cryptocurrencies are some alt-punk movement" part. I just think that for basic banking services (a basic checking account where I can store money and pay for stuff) blockchain alone will be enough. I can imagine how the technology can solve these security issues further down the road, though. I'm no expert, but I'm optimistic.

How many people besides you do you know that buy records frequently? I don't mean to press, I'm a pro musician and even I don't buy records anymore. All my stuff is free to listen to on SoundCloud and Spotify. Musicians never made money selling records, even before the internet.

Not going extinct per se, but they will have to radically change their business models and service portfolio if they want to keep up with blockchain tech and stay relevant to consumers. Most people just want an account where they can stash their money and buy stuff electronically for convenience. Blockchain gives us that. When this tech is sufficiently mature and taken its due scale, I'm never using a regular bank again.
Edit: redundance.

Like I said, unless you're Coldplay and writing songs for Mercedes-Benz commercials, you're likely not earning much money from selling music. Most musicians I know (I know a lot, and none of them are in Coldplay) earn money from playing gigs. Most musicians I know also want their music available to everyone so they can get new people to listen and hopefully to attend concerts. Mine are free to listen on SoundCloud; it's a choice which not many make. They'd rather have them on platforms which pay (YouTube, Spotify etc.). Still, I'd say 90% of their income comes from merch (a record is considered merch. People buy them as souvenirs nowadays) and playing gigs.

I'm sure Africa will move to streaming and cloud computing eventually when the bandwidth and price-performance of internet-enabled devices improves.

Dude, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that they wouldn't do it if they could, but you're talking about a bill that hasn't even gone to vote in Congress. Plus, that bill has simply overarching guidelines about implementing it as an institutional mechanism, without going into technical details on exactly HOW this will be achieved from an ENGINEERING perspective. From the bill, and your link:


Which actions? Disruption where? Which kind of disruption? Which infrastructure? What is critical infrastructure and what isn't? The internet's infrastructure is SHARED globally; this is why I asked you if you knew how the internet worked. It's perfectly possible for you to shut down internet services nationally - it's even happened here in Brazil with specific services like WhatsApp - but you'll never be able to shut down the internet globally without accessing other nations' infrastructure or running into some serious diplomatic issues. Unless you're willing to go to war with everybody just to shut down some DNS and hosting servers overseas. This is nuts.
