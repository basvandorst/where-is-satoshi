Really nice work!
I'm certainly going to share this with some folk that are more curious about how the bitcoin blockchain operates. I think you explained things very nicely.
Awesome job, and thank you!.

Electrum is a great wallet and supports segwit but it uses Bech32 ( as opposed to the native P2SH ( which always starts with a 3.
Bech32 is segwit compatible, but it seems like most exchanges and other places are not yet setup to send to Bech32 addresses which makes them sort of hard to use at this point. 
Electrum is great. You can set it up as segwit address or continue with the regular format. Electrum seems to not support P2SH at this time though.
edit - Perhaps a decent article, I didnt read it fully but it may be of intrest to you (

No need to "buy" a wallet. 
I use electrum. 
Feel free to msg me and I will help :). I suggest reading up a bit first though and then you might figure it out =D.

Transfer to a controlled wallet of your choosing to maintain 100% control. 
I.E. Trezor (hardware wallet), Electrum (destop wallet; best through tails OS), Mycellium, etc.

only you should have access to your private key.
If the private key is input to a website then it is immediately "out in the world" and you can no longer claim full confident ownership.
I'm sure you can import private keys through online wallets today and it would be encrypted and such, but I HIGHLY advise against it.
I encrypt my important addresses &amp; private keys in a txt file with 4096 encryption then put it in a TC/VC container and put it on multiple USBs for security and redundancy (in case of failed, stolen, lost USB). I do the same with seed phrases for owned wallets.
Password confidence is necessary here. 
As to the TLDR; - Its not a question of whether it OK or not, its a matter of knowledge of ownership and security.
