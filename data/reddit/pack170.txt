ok, I misread 's comment then. You could still do that analysis though if you make some assumptions on the user's transaction sizes like everything is &lt;1kb and look for transactions with extra output in the range of 15-25k satoshi. You might end up with a lot of false positives though since micropayments would be in that range.

The static fee also leaks the wallet software they're using. If you look at every transaction with an extra 1k satoshi/kb output there is probably a good chance it's a multibit user sending that to a multibit controlled address as the fee, especially if there are multiple 1k sends to that address that day.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:38:28
yes, but as pointed out, that immediately outs you as a multibit user.

That's the limit to required reporting, there is nothing stopping your bank  (or you, if you really want) from reporting sums less than 10k too.

I'm thinking more along the lines of some bug is discovered in wallet x that you can exploit after identifying users of that wallet. Kind of like the entropy bug with blockchain.info's web wallet from a while ago. If you can identify the wallet based on transaction outputs you save time from going after every address.

I've found coinbase to generally be good on delivering the BTC by the time they say they will. They've only been late on one of my buy orders by about 12 hours with the rest of the orders in my account some time during the day they were supposed to be delivered. 
They do seem to like taking their time though, from what I can tell the bank almost always finishes the transfer a few days before the coins actually get delivered.

Looking at the RNG it looks like you're polling from analog read for entropy. You should know that this gives the output significant bias depending on the operating environment, potentially causing a break in the RNG. It is not a cryptographically secure RNG.

I'm saying that doesn't work as you've stated it.
1. User creates an address 1DARKMARKET +some arbitrary string using 
2. User creates account with the same name as the arbitrary string after 1DARKMARKET in the address they just created
3. User sends bitcoin to the address they created in step one and your system detects it and considers the bitcoin burned.
4. User scams people and eventually gets banned
5. User takes the membership fee out of the burner address because they've had the private keys all along.
6. Repeat
They have the private keys to the address you considered a burner so they can recover any fee you force them to send to that address. They are only out two transaction fees if they try to scam people.

Then break my OTP if you think it's so insecure. I'll even play by Kerckhoffs's Principle and tell you everything except the key/message


I took random numbers from random.org xored with /dev/random


The key was the same length of the message, in this case 42 random chars 


I physically handed the key on paper to my room mate 


He gave the key back a few minutes later to take out with some trash and asked why I was passing notes in the first place. I took the key and burned the paper on the stove after I finished with the trash.
My computer also rebooted to install updates since my last post so the key stored in memory is gone.

I'm about half an hr into the documentary and it looks really good so far. It would just be nice to know about what time each interview was filmed without having to consult a market chart. The only real chronology in the documentary seems to be the price of bitcoin.

Plurwolf posted his pgp public key and bitcoin addr, then catlover (probably) responded with his address encrypted with that public key along with proof of payment. Pgp is asymmetric so catlover can post his messages for plurwolf publicly and only someone with the corresponding private key (likely only to be plurwolf) can decrypt the message.

There were posts about the bear whale's supposed addresses when the sell wall was still up. It was about 40k moved in ~April from an address from 2012 to another one, then 35 or 40k from that to one of Bitstamp's suspected hot wallets or something.

The winner would be whichever fork has more hashing power behind it. It is much more likely to grow faster than the other fork(s) and the full nodes would accept it as the real blockchain.

He sells coins on the way down to get to some price he likes then puts up a massive sell order. By putting up a massive sell wall he puts downward pressure on the price and encourages others to sell lower. When its lowered sufficiently he puts in much smaller buy orders and picks up coins cheaper than his sell wall. At this point he can drop the sell wall and let the price rebound up and sell the coins he just bought at a higher price. If he has a lot in USD as well he can make a massive buy wall and try to force the price up like that.
Edit: when i last checked the wall had moved up to ~320 so it looks like there were too many people buying at 300 for his liking.

If you don't mind the more recently infected systems not being in the same state as the older systems you can avoid the overhead of downloading the entire block chain at all. They would just go off of the most recently received commands and ignore everything before the infection date. This would be useful for applications that are binary like a DDoS or fairly antonymous. 
For example you have systems A, B, and C infected and you send an order to DDoS site X. ABC see the command and attack the site. While the attack is ongoing system D is infected, but because the attack was ordered before D was infected it doesn't see the command and does nothing. Later you order the DDoS to stop and ABC stop. D sees the stop command and does nothing because it wasn't attacking in the first place. 
This change helps keep the infection hidden by not having such an obvious tell tail network signature on system infection (downloading 20+ gb of the blockchain). It would just need to store the most recent block like your thin client example. 
This also helps avoid your botnet attacking old targets as it downloads the entire blockchain on system infection. Lets say you order an attack on (small) site X today and they bribe you to get it to stop after the attack has gone on for a few days. Then a year from now you get a surge in infections that doubles your botnet size in a very short amount of time. As the new infections download the blockchain they will see the attack command from a year ago and execute it (assuming no other rules). The newly infected systems are now going to DDoS site X until they download up to the stop command. If there are enough of them they will knock it offline and the protection money site X paid doesn't mean much any more. 
The legacy attacks could also be used to identify infected systems before the blockchain finishes downloading, potentially limiting the lifetime of an infected system. 
Edit: wait you still need some checkpoints to establish a root of trust to make sure you're getting the actual block chain, but you could set the checkpoints arbitrarily close to the current date to avoid downloading a significant portion of the blockchain. You can also update the checkpoints with new versions of the malware to keep the amount of the blockchain needed small.

It looks like there is, but it's not easy to see with the cumulative return line and the shading chosen. You can see the 1 year return line end above the darker one about a year ago on the chart. The 2 year return line ends 2 years ago but it is really hard to see if you don't look at the timeline at the bottom. It would have been better if the shading wasn't just slightly different shades of blue but completely different colors.

Yes you could use a side channel that is harder to get information from, but (probably) less convenient to use. For example the couriers the US and USSR used when exchanging keys for the Washington- Moscow hotline. One plane ride could get you months worth of OTP keys you could use for everything else.

That depends on what you're trying to do. 


In this case you would be able to bypass any blocking of Tor by your ISP, workplace, whatever. This hides that you're using Tor from someone between you and your VPN and hides what you're doing from your VPN. The trade off is that you're still vulnerable to deanonymizing attacks on Tor and your Tor exit node can see everything that gets sent out to the open internet in the clear. However depending on how you're using the internet the deanonymizing attacks could just reveal the VPN you're using without compromising your identity. For example read only web browsing probably wouldn't reveal too much about yourself even if the exit node found your VPN, but logging into facebook over an http (not https) connection would.


In this case your ISP or work can see that you're using Tor, but like the last example can't see what you're doing. The Tor exit node only sees encrypted traffic going to your VPN and generally can't get much info out of that about who you are. You could still be vulnerable to deanonymizing attacks because you're connected to Tor directly, but I don't know of any that work against encrypted traffic except for controlling most of the Tor network. This keeps your VPN from learning your IP (assuming they dont have a program on your comp giving that anyway) and if you've paid for the VPN anonymously (bitcoin, cash in mail, etc) they may never even learn your identity. 
In either case your connection is going to be fucking slow, because you're using Tor. I generally just stick to my VPN and don't really use Tor anymore.

If you make the address name a function of the username with a predefined prefix like that you could just create a vanity address that starts with 1DARKMARKET and take the rest of the address as your username so you don't lose the coins. You need a suffix that can't be reversed easily from the username if you want to try something like that like the first X bits of the sha512 hash of the username

The difficulty changes every X blocks, it just happens to be every 2 weeks because of the 10 minute block goal. If you brought an ASIC back from the future that was orders of magnitudes faster than the entire network, you would just mine up all the blocks before the difficulty change very quickly and force a difficulty change out of the 2 week cycle, then be back to 10 min blocks after the difficulty change.

Assuming the underlying crypto is secure it doesn't matter how much processing power they have. When you're trying to brute force a 256 bit key you're going to experience the heat death of the universe before you crack it.

It's even bigger than just the difference between authenticated/ unauthenticated encryption. You need something to make it difficult for an attacker to spoof the authentication or you could end up like WEP. One of the [one of the fastest attacks against it]( involves breaking it's MAC with just 128 spoofed packets on average.

2048 is deterministic though. The original game used the browser's default js rand() function, an insecure entropy source. If you really wanted to you could actually have the AI figure out the seed for rand() and you would know exactly how every move is going to affect the board down as many turns into the future as you want. For firefox it uses the [Mersenne Twister]( which can be broken by looking at 624 consecutive rand() calls if you really want to supercharge your 2048 AI
