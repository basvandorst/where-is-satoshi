Not licensed but I've worked in management consulting with bank clients and been in and out the books on similar issues. I think you're stretching in how you're interpreting "control", Finex didnt just have the money, they had full access to move it around etc, it firmly establishes control IMO.
furthermore, the link you originally provided basically gives an example of a firm like Bitfinex, in demonstrating a case where client funds _should_ be [recorded as an asset](
The example where the asset isn't being recorded is with the post office handling money transfers :)
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:09:35


Finex had complete control of the funds, I don't think you're made any argument about why they would "fail those tests". You stated that client funds aren't on financial statements, but that's demonstrably 100% false. Do you have any other points to attempt to make in backing up your otherwise unsupported claim?

the point of the haircut is that they can cover all the withdrawals when they do open. let the exodus happen, and then they can fight and see if they will be a successful business to pay back the 36% lost for ppl with their token. this is the fairest way to do it.
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:18:32
fine, but let us withdraw the damn 64% first! 
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:20:28
Sorry but you're wrong. It's double entry accounting.
You with, say, BTC have an asset (which correspondingly is equity as long as you really own the pvt keys and have this asset).
The minute you deposit your asset with some exchange, your asset is now also a corresponding liability because you no longer own it you just "own" it, as in, you have the rights to the BTC but you have lent it to the exchange.
So your asset, which is now also a liability, is now in possession of the exchange. This makes the asset also recorded on the exchange's balance sheet now too, as well as a corresponding liability to provide it back to you when you demand it.
Now both entities (you and the exchange) have the asset and liability recorded.

Uh, you are obviously not understanding how the haircut works and how people selling tokens representing a complete loss at &gt;0 reduces the haircut for depositors who sell out at any price &gt;0.
Edit: I think I see how you misunderstood the title. I'm not saying _all_ depositors get this effective cut, it's those who sell at current prices of the token. The haircut is being filled by other speculators, Finex isn't raising any money out of it except for the fees in trading it.

You think you owned bitcoin that you sent to someone else? Bitfinex might have bent over backwards to try to make things look this way but you are just part of the pool of creditors who are owed money by Finex, there's no special tag on your coins that make you immune from when the exchange loses money.
Either Finex goes through proper bankruptcy procedures and all the creditors get social-lossed anyway years from now, or they set up a scheme to social loss things now.
Or they let people withdraw funds if they have them and the individuals behind Bitfinex get criminal charges for embezzlement.

@_date: 2016-08-07 06:30:31


okay, then what are they, when Finex is in custody of customer deposits? contra-liabilities? nope. contra-equity? nope. they OWE YOU THE MONEY, so they're definitely a liability, so how does that balance on their books?
I have consulted for banks and this is how deposits are accounted for in that context, so either make a proper argument for why this is diffrent in this context or stop pretending to be a CPA
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:28:27


This doesn't really matter, companies always have illegal and invalid claims in their ToS.


The last thing they should be worried about at this point is civil liability with CFTC for regulations, which is ostensibly why the Bitgo setup was even implemented.


You present one argument for this, I argue differently for an alternative handling... but we just disagree. And until we get more information about how the breach happened and the status of the Bitfinex balance sheet (i.e., their ablity to cover the hole), it's too difficult to properly judge.
BTW, If you have Telegram, come to our group, lots of Bitfinex creditors and traders in general discussing the multiple angles of this issue:  ( homepage link:  )

The funny thing is that when Gatecoin got hacked and did [90% haircuts]( on ETH depositors, Arthur had [nothing but praise]( for them:

@_date: 2016-08-04 08:42:26


You seem to be under the misunderstanding that Bitfinex is a regulated financial entity that has protections for customer funds. They are not. The funds are essentially just commingled and their BitGo integration was obviously a huge fiasco that doesn't change any of their liability issues. Users did not have private keys or full access to the funds, Bitfinex had full access only, so they are responsible.
We are all creditors now. And FYI, i had 0 BTC on there, but decent amount of USD, and I actually support the haircut idea, it's the most fair way really, even though i would benefit more if they just screwed the BTC guys and let the rest of us take the pickings.
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:49:49


Yea that's one point in favor of arguing the solution where only the BTC ppl lose funds, but the BTC people will just sue them for the funds anyway. We're talking 120,000 BTC, only about 20% of that being lent on margin. There's big holders who can and will fund an action against them which is almost entirely certain to occur if they choose this path.

surely if the whole point of Bitgo was to comply with regulations then they'd have to do it for all the margin trading not just BTC.

@_date: 2016-08-07 06:47:47


you keep saying this without making a proper argument.
we are in agreement that the funds deposited are liability for Bitfinex, but you are ignoring how that liability of the customer deposit is balanced out in the events I outlined in [this reply to you]( A = L + E.  We know that when you deposit with Finex it is an L, but that balances out, showing the customer funds in custody on A. This is basic stuff, if you're really a CPA you'd know this.
either make an argument or stop just repeating "I am a CPA, you are wrong, it is a liability", because I have laid it out pretty clearly
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:08:39
yea fuck the rule of law and logic and stuff. creepy guy must go to jail if woman makes an accusation! or something.
@_date: 2016-08-04 08:33:49


that's total bullshit. they have a massive hole in their books right now, there's no magic firewall between customer funds and their funds where they can just drain all their non-customer liquid assets and shaft customers -- that would be embezzlement because they are obligated to repay creditors before shareholders get disbursements.
an injunction right now would lead to a total freezing of assets that not even principals can access by a bankruptcy court who takes over the business. that's really how this _should_ be done, which means all of us with any deposits on finex are creditors.
you're just reading into their ToS and making assumptions with apparently zero bankruptcy law knowledge and hoping that you, as not a BTC depositor there on Finex, are safe. that's just not how this is going to play out and you will see soon enough.
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:37:29


no, it won't. dont spread this misinformation. this isn't how bankruptcies go when lawsuits force companies into them. the judgment of 100% would just end up sending them into bankruptcy and the haircut comes on the backend. there's no way out of this, it sucks but the solution for avoiding the stupid legal costs and shit of the process is to just apply the loss now, with Bitfinex chipping in their fair share, and then letting ppl get their shit now, and letting the finex guys try tow ork it off. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 05:45:33


oh boy, not this myth again...
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:00:48
taking Finex into bankruptcy means you go through like 4-5 years of administration and all the legal costs, consulting costs, accounting costs including paying OTHER creditors before the depositors.
good luck getting less than 36% haircut in that process.
finex lost money, they are insolvent, they either do this and fast-forward the haircut or go through the legal process and everyone gets screwed with a bigger haircut. dont be dumb, let this go without lawyer fees so depositors get maximum return.

@_date: 2016-08-04 09:05:03


But isn't it clear that gross negligence is why the custodial funds were lost?
business law is all about the concept of 'best practice'. Can you name a single bitcoin exchange that does NOT use a cold wallet setup to protect customer funds? Bitfinex is the only Bitcoin exchange who decided to throw customer fund security out the window and use this "segregated user funds" scheme (which really was just an attempt to comply with CFTC -- which it's not really clear that they were even in compliance).
Thus Bitfinex was grossly negligent with customer funds and they are responsible for the losses. 


We are also still missing information about exactly how the breach occurred, and you're right, they are unregulate so right now they can just drain all the company funds, including customer funds, and just run off. But that's illegal. It is embezzlement in the case of the company funds being drained and it's outright theft in the case of the customer funds if they run off with all them. These are criminal charges they would be liable for. 
Civilly, they just need to admit insolvency and go through bankrtupcy, and make good (as much as possible) through company funds on all of us creditors who deposited, lent, or did anything with Bitfinex. That's the oldmoney way of doing things though. Poloniex shows a good model for how we can all get through this with minimal pain.
We still need more information to clarify things, but I dont think your point about bailment or the Bitgo setup changes much of anything, because Bitfinex was not following best practices and users did not have effective control over the funds outside of the platform. Neither of us are bankruptcy experts or judges so we can't say for sure, even if we start digging through statutes and common law resources.
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:40:30
Yes it's possible.
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:13:48


but Bitfinex takes your USD deposits, puts them in the bank, and earns the interest. You don't earn interest on USD deposits at Finex unless you led them on the p2p market.


Seems pretty commingled to me, ETH , LTC and ETC are still stored in cold wallet where they're all jumbled in the same place where Finex keeps their holdings. USD are all stored in the same main account in Taiwan where company funds are kept.


Finex getting $70M of the funds taken is making them insolvent and needing to do this scheme or go into bankruptcy, i'd say that they have sufficiently borne the risk of holding the funds as they are now failing because they have been stolen
@_date: 2016-08-14 03:39:43


you dont understand, for banks to be properly licnesed with fed they buy "shares" ( not the best word for it ) in the Fed which pay 6% deposit, no matter what. its just a way to keep member banks with a stake in the overall system. this doesn't give banks "a seat on the Fed" -- the Board is still just political appointments.

well, [page 2]( basically settles it at least as far as the IFRS standards are concerned:




There's no doubt that Finex was in control of the funds, so condition 1 is met.

Pretty simple, we are in a liquidity trap, where rates are stuck at 0%, so base money is interchangeable with bills and short term debt. 
Krugman has been right about this, Libertarians have been wrong, so you won't see this opinion upvoted here, but it's true.
The monetary base expansion that was part of QE was an Asset Swap, pure and simple. They created interest-bearing reserve money (an asset) and bought mortgage bonds and other shit with them. This is not inflationary, not when we are at the zero lower bound.
It's basic economics, but Libertarians are shit at basic economics, hence the mass confusion over elementary concepts regarding money supply and inflation relationship.

Honestly, you made the claim that US exports its inflation due to having a major world reserve currency, and you never made a coherent argument with any points supporting your claim.
What does the world's reserve currency mean? It means the rest of world has excess demand for US dollars. This means that the US is able to run unusual current account deficits since international investors desire to hold dollars. Bernanke calls this "global savings glut", others like Summers say this is due to "secular stagnation". But these dollars they hold have to be invested in something -- and usually are invested in safe US government bonds AKA the funding mechanism of current account imbalances. Thus, the US has been running a perpetual current account deficit to fuel international demand and the US government bond yields are still close to 0%!
So, where's the "exporting its inflation"?
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:49:09


How expensive is it to just issue special purpose bonds that some primary market dealer passes off to the Fed, who monetizes it?

You can come up with any number of schemes that achieve the same underlying effect of govt snapping its fingers to create money for whatever reason

You _still_ haven't made a single point about "exporting inflation", while just insisting what youre saying is true and "not debatable". Do you know what inflation even means?
Foreigners demanding dollars, bidding up the FX value of USD, does not "export inflation".  It does allow the US to run large current account deficits (or rather, it's the other side of the accounting mechanism).


So if nobody wants USD; they will sell it ,which will make the USD weaker in FX terms, and which will make the US current account deficit shrink because imports will become too expensive in the US. This is a self-adjusting mechanism. There's no looming crisis because of this, it just means the US economy will start hopefully exporting more instead of funding consumption with all the savings of foreigners.

econ phd student here, you're missing the main point that most people here are misunderstanding: QE isn't "dumping new dollars into the global economy"; it's an asset swap. liquid bank reserves traded for less-liquid lower quality assets (GSEs, MBSes, etc). This effectively sterilizes the expansionary effect of the monetary base. As much as people here hate Krugman, he has been completely right on modeling the effects of M0 expansion while we are in a liquidity trap.

I wish I could downvote you 100x for spreading this idiotic fearmongering. 
If you think QE is just "money printing" a la Zimbabwe, then you don't understand QE.
Japan has expanded its central bank balance sheet since the 1990s with no hyperinflation and no concerns -- and guess what, they're not the world reserve currency. 
Industrial nations who are monetary sovereigns with no significant foreign-denominated external debt or constraints on convertability of their currency (be it gold, or euro, or whatever) do not face the issues that Zimbabwe, Russia, and Weimar faced.

- Entrepreneur processes payments using Paypal
- After making thousands of dollars, the requisite KYC/AML documents are sent for the corporate entity used to conduct business.
- Months and $10,000's later, funds are frozen for "inadequate documentation"
- Invasive questions are made regarding the business conducted.
- Paypal, not content with the DNA sample and background check they have gotten from you, keep your funds frozen into perpetuity.
- Vaguely claim "violations of user agreement" while keeping funds frozen.
No chargebacks, no frauds, just a successful business selling services and online content can cause Paypal to end you whenever they feel like it.

Let's read this article that you have referenced, shall we?


This was back when QE was in full force, and the USD was actually _weakening_ :




This is basically the complete opposite of what your claims were. This usage of "exporting inflation" is actually a somewhat valid classification, because QE was weakening the dollar, which as world reserve currency, made world commodities priced in USD cheaper, and thus led to higher demand and inflation internationally (hence "exporting" inflation).
Of course, this is completely different than the world reserve currency effect you were suggesting, where global demand made US imports cheaper, which somehow meant "exporting inflation". Very different things.

Not necessarily. The Fed could just wash away the debt, they would own it after all. And any negative equity can just be written into the Fed's balance sheet. The risk with this is of course inflation, but is that much of a concern right now with CPI and BPI (MIT private measure of inflation) at such low levels?
 &gt;If the government were to simply print it's own money, it could spend it, and then that would be the end of the obligation.
Yes this is in effect what the spreadsheet fun would be achieving. Even if you just print money and throw it out there you still have to record that entry and things still "balance out" one way or another. You can either end the obligation immediately or make some kind of debt jubilee later where the Fed says "lol we just forgave 1 trillion in debt and our equity took a hit, but who cares since we print USD". But yea, again, the risk here is in inflation sparking off in a crisis of confidence that would result. 
It's an experiment the world has not yet really tried -- for such a dominant economy like the US with no gold standard or any peg that would hinder the external account to try flat out monetizing debt or printing money with a helicopter drop in a deflationary trap. Weimar happened because they were printing DM to pay gold while they had a peg. Zimbabwe happened because of their huge USD liabilities (effectively same risks as a peg). 
Japan has gotten close to doing this -- in fact some argue they already have (their debt/gdp ratio is over 200%, but their bond rates are still 0-1%), demonstrating partly how the risk is overblown about debt monetization and printing for monetary sovereigns (ie., not countries like Greece who dont have that control), AT LEAST WITHIN THIS CURRENT CONTEXT.

@_date: 2015-06-10 14:16:31


You're better off just not using a useless term like "exporting inflation".
You're talking about two completely different mechanisms here:
1) QE, expanding monetary base in liquidity trap, which is ineffective as banks end up not creating credit anyway as the zero lower bound is governing the returns.
2) Dollar as world's reserve currency. This is also what the French in the post-WWII era called "the exorbitant privilege" which enabled the US to borrow money cheap because of the international demand for USD.
The fact that QE (1) has no effect on inflation has nothing to do with (2).  Look at Japan, they did CRAZY amounts of QE in 1990s and 2000s -- no inflation to be found there. And since they aren't the world's reserve currency, clearly it's not a factor. Also, look at the UK, they have also done QE, with no inflation, which was certainly not "exported" due to their world reserve currency (as they dont have one, only the US does!)
You need to read about the liquidity trap and how base money expansion changes when we have reached 0% lower bound. Reserves pile up because banks simply don't bother loaning out money because equilibrium real rates are BELOW 0, so it takes an unusually long time to pull out of (hence why the crisis has been 7+ years ongoing).

But if you want to do the SPECIFIC way they win: like "Mayweather on points" or "mayweather TKO" -- this is where you go to the Props betting...
So be careful, because the Props betting is really specific in the event you are betting on, so make sure you realize that there are alternatives. Like you dont wanna bet on Mayweather winning by decision and then he ends up knocking out Pacman and then you get rekt....

The opsec alone, with an unstable person like Star being the only one in control of the keys for cold storage, is enough to make anyone with any stake on OKCoin to get out and get out fast.
By my count, OKCoin (brand, entity, whatever you want to call it) has committed at least 3 counts of fraud from the fake proof of reserves, the forged contract, and forging CZ's signature on bank transfers. This doesn't even include the unethical and shady volume faking.

You have to make assumptions about whether you are receiving or taking the order.
Since it's $5/coin and youre selling 2.5 coins that you bought for $1000, then it's exactly $12.5. However there's the slippage in practice as explained in the page.
edit: so, lets say the bitmex fee is 0.1 paid and 0.3 on one, that's 0.2% net fee on bitmex, and the bitcoin buy and sell on spot is 0.1% on one and 0.2% on other, that's 0.3% net on spot. so 0.5% total fee on the futures and spot transactions. That eats up almost half the profit right there.

Yes, Step 2 provides the margin needed to open the short position on futures.
You could of course have your futures account already funded and trade, but it helps to show the arbitrage in one clean motion for illustration.
Your futures position short -10 at $405 will have a profit at $400 of 0.0308 BTC. Thus your futures balance will now be 2.5 + 0.0308 = 2.5308. At current price at expiration of $400 that gives you $1012.32.   So your $1000 just turned $12.32 in profit in the two days.

Glad you are interested!
To answer your question, the 10 contracts @ 405 are not purchased but sold.
The contracts are Inverse contracts which lock in USD value when you short, so the formula is:
Profit in BTC = (1/405 - 1/500) * 100 USD * -10 = -0.4692
The 405 = price opened, 500 = price closed, -10 = 10 contracts short

To be as conservative as possible, here's an example of a bunch of the points of where fees could hit, if you wanted to buy stuff with card connected to your account:
1. $1000 deposit (bank fee)
2. Buying 2.5 BTC (spot exchange fee)
3. Transfer 2.5 BTC to BitMEX (miner's fee)
3. Sale of Futures on BitMEX (futures exchange fee)
4. Settlement of Futures on BitMEX (futures exchange fee)
5. BTC transfer from BitMEX (miner's fee)
6. BTC sale into $ (spot exchange fee)
7. $ transfer from exchange to bank account (bank fee)
8. CC fees when buying stuff (card fee)
Note: miner's fees are not negligible when you want to get confirmed as fast as possible to lock profits in.
Hope this doesn't dissuade you from arbing ;)
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:04:21
Nope, none of the price change risk exists for this, that's why it's an arbitrage. Price can go to $1000 or $100 and it won't change your guaranteed profit.
Edit: to clarify, the risk over those 2 days is that OKCoin or whatever exchange you use blows up, or that massive socialized losses affect the contract period, stuff like that. Real tail risk things that have not happened much before, although big socialized losses used to be a problem last year.

Two reasons:
1) The fake volume went beyond customers washing trades at 0% -- it was outright fraud. The fee introduction gives them an out to put an end to all fake volume activities and it seems for now they are taking it. Put simply: the volume was not customers eagerly trading at 0% fees
2) The way they "offered leverage" was fraudulent in itself. They were allowing naked-shorting. So you didn't have to actually have funds properly allocated to buy and sell btc (the way, say, Bitfinex does it).
All in all, we get a more realistic picture of the role that China's spot market plays. This means that traders can start using indicators that are volume-based for Chinese charts. It also means traders are better informed in general about any structural features in the market.

The latter is correct, the former is not.
It's just a fiat card that you can top up with companies by sending them bitcoin, which they sell to fund the card.
That's not really a "bitcoin card".
A "bitcoin card" would be, like, a card that transfers bitcoin to a company who receives the bitcoin. Like if you had a card connected to an address that has the pvt key to make payments, and POS system that then uses your card to send to the address of the merchant.
I'm not sure if a real bitcoin card actually exists.
But these fiat cards that accept bitcoin deposits are definitely not "bitcoin cards"

Right but in card form you could still access the funds with a second factor (PIN) just like a normal fiat card (and a properly secured phone wallet), and it would perhaps have added value in organising receipts or something. But yea, it's hard to come up with a use-case that makes a card better than phone app. It's kind of forcing the use of the card.
@_date: 2017-01-26 08:37:44


I've had other issues (fees on the card, support being really slow and unresponsive), but I think the big problem is that bitcoin is all about being in control of your money. Obviously when you are using any third party like an exchange or Xapo you sacrifice real ownership, but there's still an expectation in the community (even when using third parties) to have on-demand access to the funds. They should not accept bitcoin deposits only to then require documents after the fact and prohibiting withdrawing of the bitcoin. That is a fatal flaw for a lot of bitcoiners so it is a matter of preference as to how sensitive someone is to this.
Maybe I'm just angry in the moment and I will have a different perspective later, but this is how I feel now. Also, for what i use Xapo for (bitcoin wallet -- can just use electrum, debit card -- can just top up cards instantly anyway with btc on say advcash) it really isn't a "must use" service IMO. Plus these days they're going for the uphold/multi-currency"fintech" type crowd not bitcoiners.

1) they already require documents in mid 2015 when I got the debit card.
2) they randomly FROZE my bitcoin on there (i can't withdraw them even now) and then put me through a requirement to upload documents to be able to access any funds. 
dox'ing a customer to deposit funds or use a debit card or whatever, is of course fine. randomly freezing money and holding it hostage until they submit to kyc/aml procedures is not fine.
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:31:09


lol no it's not. this is bitcoin, there are a number of futures contracts, and a few illiquid options, but there's no setups where holding a futures short to margin call is some master trade of a bigger portfolio.
the fact is the trader could have _not_ shorted $5 million worth of BTC and profited more, so by engaging in this short he lost money. it doesnt matter if he had $50 million worth of BTC on the side that increased in value.

what on earth makes you think this?
did you not witness what happened to Ethereum with Ethereum Classic? 
In what world do you think that the old original chain will not persist and retain real market value like Ethereum Classic and even ZCash Classic? The difficulty gap provides some cover, but the risk is still there.
The reality to seems that hardforkers support 2 chains because there's high likelihood that old chain retains sufficient mining and trading interest, and there will then be 2 valid claims to Bitcoin.
So the question remains: those who think this is bullish, which coin will moon? Will the price of original bitcoin chain drop while new one rises? Will combined value be higher than the pre-hardfork original chain?
Edit: Also even if you combine the ETH hardfork with old chain (as Roger Ver argued before) it's still worse than pre-fork.

all euro becomes drachma at whatever rate they announce. then the government budget is free from the requirements in ERM and can spend as many drachma as it wants. 
but this scenario is almost impossible because the liabilities incurred, especially external debt in both private and public sector, is made contractually in euros. so there's legal questions about how this is treated since euro exit is theoretically not reversible (or was designed this way at least).
and right now the Bank of Greece operations are very limited because they are subordinate to the greater ECB system

no they're not, the banks are solvent as they were...
the problem is with the ECB funding to meet the withdrawal needs. this is a liquidity, not a solvency problem, for Greek banks. and it's a political decision by the ECB to cap the fund provision. of course if the liquidity problem is not addressed [it creates a solvency problem]( this is because the real goal of troika is regime change in Greece.
The government debt on the otherhand...that is a case of insolvency.

the point is that all banking systems are "insolvent" if you want to use the definition that loosely.
no banking system on earth (fractional reserve of course) can withstand cash withdrawals en masse, this is equivalent of a massive defunding of banks and a shrinking of their balance sheet.
so again, the asset quality of the Greek banks' portfolios was and is fine, the problem is that the ECB has put on pressure and caused panic to induce a bank run and force Syriza to accept a bad deal. 
ELA to Greek system would not have been necessary if people were not being panicked to withdraw funds from Greek banks after the election earlier this year!

yea the persistent China premium is certainly an indication of that, that's one theory.
I'm just commenting on the ability of Kyle Bass to analyze Asian financial systems...






China has a tendency to break a lot of the rules that roundeyes think financial systems are constrained with. So if Bass is as wrong on China as he was on Japan, then the risk of crisis probably overestimated.
That said, I _am_ bearish on China, BUT i dont think Bitcoin needs a China crisis to be bullish. In fact, crisis in China may end up being bearish for bitcoin for a number of reasons (to name two examples: (1)state cracks down on bitcoin channel of capital control evasion, (2) Chinese ditch bitcoin for RMB in order to meet state-fiat-denominated obligations like taxes and debt service). Most people are already familiar with the bull case: China crisis -&gt; RMB deval fears -&gt; FOMO BTC.  The question is, which effect wins out? 
tl;dr I don't predicate my bullishness on  on a Chinese crisis and I urge others to also not rely too much on this occurring

this is due to withdrawals after election not NPL's (nonperforming loans).

This is patently false. Every aspect of the fed, minus certain monetary policy actions, are subject to Congressional scrutiny.


Not sure what you're smoking with this. Every member HAS to be nominated by the president, confirmed by Senate. What private corporation on earth has this kind of corporate structure? None. The Fed is not a private corporation.
Furthermore, the Fed sends over 90% of its profits to the US Treasury:
No private corporation in the US is required by law to remit a majority of their profits to the US Treasury.
The Federal Reserve is an independent government agency. Plain and simple. Just because private banks have non-governing dividend-paying shares in the Fed, does not change the nature of the power structure both in how the Board of Governors are appointed and how profits are handled.

That's not hacked though, that's just, a hacker who hacked someone else and using those credentials to manipulate.
From an insurance company's point of view it has to be a proper hacking. Otherwise it incentivizes everyone out there to fake a hacking just to commit fraud. There has to be some hurdles to that so its not so easy.

It's an important distinction.
The transfer was done willingly by the BitPay execs. None of them got hacked, phished, anything. They were just socially manipulated.  The transfer was obviously fraudulent, but it was not fraudulently caused.

basically you salt it with a term you do know. something impossible not to know. even your first name.
then you generate a random password that is &lt;term&gt;  with 4 random numbers.
that way, you are forced to brute force the symmetrically-encrypted file containing the seed, using the term you know, and with the knowledge that the password is completed with 4 random digits following

this seems pointless. when you make multiple steps you have multiple vectors of losing your seed forever (assuming this is your only copy). all kinds of weird things can happen that compromise any one of those places where a "piece" of the puzzle exists. so spreading it out excessively multiplies your risk of losing.
But more broadly, you need to be more careful about where you're storing these seed components...
what if you get robbed one day and some thief steals a bunch of stuff in your place, including your diary?
what if your house catches on fire and it's burnt to ashes while you're at work?
your plan has to account for all kinds of insanity, including you getting brain damaged or otherwise incapacitated...

no, i was obviously objecting to your sarcasm about it being a feature, which you understood fine, but somehow youre confused anyway?


That's false. It's painful for an insignificant portion of the user base. Sorry for idiots who can't double check addresses they send money too. But people also send money to the wrong bank accounts all the time when typing in the wrong number. The only difference is irreversibility, which, YES, once again, IS COMPLETELY A FEATURE WHICH HAS UNIQUE BENEFITS TO BITCOIN OVER OTHER PAYMENT SYSTEMS. If you still don't understand this, it's your lack of intelligence which is the problem here.

I store my keyfile (i use keepassx not keepass) on an encrypted USB.
I keep a backup offsite physically (encrypted USB w diff pass) as well as on a server (with an added layer of encryption for the server backup).
You can never avoid having a single point of failure (heck, your computer is one -- if you got rooted and keylogged it would be game over for non-2factored services), but you can at least layer the encryption to make that single point very difficult to fail.

Bitcoin in headline of positive story in major paper? wat do
@_date: 2015-10-16 05:11:35
it's popular because it's correct. armed gangs (govt) have set up a system with their rich friends (banks) to create and distribute the accepted money in society which is necessary to pay taxes or mafia gets you.
bitcoin can play a great and important role in holding this corrupt system to some degree of account, and push it toward a more democratic management (but still leaving the heart of the system in place)...
but it's not going to completely surmount it.
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:16:07


this is not what is happening right now, if you watched the markets more carefully. 
At the very beginning, Bitfinex crypto pairs were trading at a premium due to the panic.
Now the story is very different, Bitfinex is trading a 10% discount to GDAX on BTC. All the idiots who were panic-buying to get out already have left the platform. Now traders are hungry for USD on Bitfinex because there's attractive swap rates to take advantage of and because the banking issues make getting fiat in to the exchange a challenge.
you're such a casual

Congratulations! You've got some good advice in this thread: store on hardware wallet or paper wallet. 
Great job and be careful, lots of scammers out there and you got lucky once dont push your luck with more risky bets.
if youre worried about the USD value of some of those coins, be sure to use a Futures Exchange to "hedge" the value of them (so you dont have to sell them into dollars). OKCoin or BitMEX are good solutions for this. Let me know if you need help with this so I dont waste time wall-of-texting here.

first of all, calm down. they're not even worth 100 million, let alone billionaires.
second, sybil attack can't prevent the UASF from working, because as long as economically meaningful (i.e., nodes that are actually sending coins around within the network, not just AWS dummy nodes) are sending BIP148 coins around, and exchanges make a market for them, then it just can't be stopped.

All he had to do was leave the country, go to Switzerland or just get out of Europe. Go to some island, make a company there under your name, make a bank account under company name. Sell the coins and transfer them to that account.  They don't ask questions when banking is private. Even Hong Kong will just do standard KYC/AML in signup and then just let you transfer in money saying it's client contributions or even investor funds.

@_date: 2017-06-02 05:06:21
I'll break down the suggestions as such:
- "storing coins" is not the same as "using coins for trading".
- always keep a majority of your coins in cold storage, no exceptions.
- trade using margin positions (to minimize counterparty risk)
- use futures contracts as a tool which offers really low margin requirements (just be careful about being overleveraged)
- put coins on exchange only when you want to make a position, and then transfer them out when you're done. (The current status of the network makes that a bit of a pain, but that would be ideal.)
- Broadly, only sacrifice ownership of your coins when absolutely necessary, i.e., for an ACTIVE position...
