Fired up my RPi and im trying this out.




It won't go any further






Now you say android bitcoin wallet, it probably is! Does this make it any easier? I searched for a APK of 2013 but couldn't find any. The current version only includes scanning paper wallets

Managed to get the private key. 








I'll try to import it somewhere
Thanks for the help!!!

One line is 76 characters long, it doesn't start with a 5, but U2. The whole thing ends with Q=.
I don't know if any of that helps as i'm a noob with this.

I have tried this, dragging it into the square @ 
It just opens the file in Chrome and Edge, I renamed it to wallet.dat aswell
