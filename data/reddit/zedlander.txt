Where do you buy from?
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:59:31
We love Coinbase, we're just trying to provide an even easier way for new people to get into the Bitcoin world and start experimenting. We think that $5 is worth the fast checkout time.
@_date: 2014-09-30 19:55:23
Oh you're right. Definitely missed that
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:21:20
They could just buy on demand from an exchange

Hey guys, this is the story that was aired where we gave away the bitcoin ( Unfortunately there's not a recording of the giveaway, but we sent out an Electrum wallet seed using the [chirp.io]( app. The bitcoins were gone from [the wallet]( within 1 minute.
They were won by who talked about it over on [this thread](

That happens when you opt to have us create a Coinbase account for you. It's part of their onboarding process and not something we can control.
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:10:54
To be fair, they do have a giant red warning on their deposit page. Did you not read it?

Hey, I'm one of the founders. We're not too far from Windsor! And we know several people who run ATMs. Shoot me an email: trevor

That's because they have an attendant physically there to make sure you don't buy more than $3000/day

Hey there,
We definitely only emailed people who signed up on our list. Our branding used to look like this, maybe you forgot you signed up? 
@_date: 2014-04-20 16:56:47
You don't. Lamassu's only do the fiat to bitcoin direction.
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:48:15
Have you tried to buy bitcoins online? It usually takes 4-5 days to get money into an exchange. Cash is fast and non-reversible, though logistically difficult. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:17:13
Unfortunately that means you can't buy from us right now. Would a Google+/Twitter option work better for you?
@_date: 2014-01-20 01:12:59
Yes. Seemed a bit more friendly than a raw private key.
@_date: 2014-01-20 13:23:48
And it's gone! Any of you get it? 
@_date: 2014-09-30 19:16:57
Still a very preliminary idea, so it'll be a while before they figure anything like that out
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:59:04
It's back again now: 
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:13:11
We have plans to change this in the future. Right now, we think it's still a much better experience than having to upload ID scans or link your bank accounts with exchanges, etc

There's actually a pretty funny story behind those "hacker" photos: 
@_date: 2013-08-05 20:57:33
The bot watches (excluding anything nsfw), so theoretically the party will be brought to every subreddit. In practice, only the top 50ish actually make it onto with any kind of regularity.
@_date: 2013-08-06 00:34:52
Haha, this is by far the best way I've ever been sent BTC!
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:26:42
How long did that transfer take to go through?
@_date: 2013-10-11 21:44:56
Thanks for the clarification, Jason.

It has to be a non-trivial amount for non-bitcoiners to be interested! We put in 1 BTC to start, and people donated another 1.8 BTC today :)
