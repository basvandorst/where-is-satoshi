You don't lose your doctor with single payer. The jobs did not come back, they are being subsidized by the government. You're literally commenting on a post about printing more USD, which is one of the major causes of inflation. Stop playing team sports. This is real life.

Such a snowflake, do your own research.

Blog post says they're preparing to expand to more currencies. Wouldn't be surprised if it was on that list.

Looks like if you deposit BTC you earn interest in BTC.

This is probably the best crypto ad yet. Great ad-to-humour ratio. Great job, eToro.

I was wondering when this was going to happen. It was crazy to think the ban would last forever. The review process will probably be annoying, but it'll help the consumer in the end.

You can withdraw on eToro US.

Ebates for BTC? Cool idea.

Shared. I don't know what I would do if that much of my funds were held from me without notice. That's ridiculous.

1) You can use companies like BlockFi to earn interest
2) I have USD that I earn from my job to pay for my place and food.
I don't really understand your point. Not all of everyone's money is in crypto, nor should it be.

I mean, I've had no issues yet and every question I've had has been answered on one of these two pages:
Always verify with your own research. Don't just trust some random blog.

How does that make it a scam? Just like anything in crypto, use it within your tolerance for risk. I don't have my whole bag in there yet, and that's the level I feel safe putting on there. It's different for everyone. For me, it's better than not earning any BTC / ETH from just holding.

Using it doesn't just mean spending it. Earning interest or getting cash-back in Bitcoin counts, imo.

You don't have to give anything to Lolli to earn Bitcoin. It's just cash-back on online purchases.

I think this is what you're looking for:

You can probably ask for some of the collateral back. It's probably more of a matter of keeping your loan's LTV in a safe zone.

Awesome to see this happening. In NYC I’m seeing a lot more Bitcoin ATMs popping up at bodegas. Hoping to hear about more of this going forward.

I think the point is more that you don’t have to sell your BTC to take advantage of the value while you hold. According to the website it also looks like taking a loan is not a taxable event.

Tokenize everything.

I mean, that's a bit of an ideological look at it, but I see your point. Love the debate. I personally see a role, even in the interim, of having elements of "traditional banking" in the blockchain space as on-ramps for people.
There are plenty of people with large bags who have no timetable for selling. And people with a large amount invested might not have a lot of personal liquid assets. So to me it makes sense as a shorter-term opportunity. I mean, if I need a bit of money to take a trip or help with a car payment, it seems like a reasonable option. 
Feel like I should ask some BlockFi folks to come weigh in on this so I don't speak on their behalf. Crypto lending is fascinating.
