I think the part about "30 years" is just a specific detail and can be any length. 6 months to a year is fine.
Here's how it could work:
User sets up one or more addresses that will automatically disperse to specified addresses after a certain time period has passed. This timed dispersal could be represented as a transaction. If there are not enough funds to cover every transaction, then funds should disperse to every address in order until funds are depleted. If no dispersal to any address is small enough to be filled, then the funds should go to a predefined "default" address.
All the owner has to do is to move the coins out of the wallet before the deadline (if he dies the deadline will pass and the coins are dispersed) and redo the whole process again.
The problem is that I really can't see any way this could be securely implemented in the Blockchain and Bitcoin protocol.

Transportation: it may cost some money to reach the meeting place.

Risk: strangers are the ones trading, so there is a higher risk when trading.
Bank accounts: sellers have bank accounts and take the risk of bank account closure when trading with exchanges so you don't have to.
Privacy: sellers are the ones who get raped with ID checks so you don't have to. Many sellers are low enough volume so that they're exempt from AML/KYC rules from which large, high-volume exchanges are not.

BTC is only divisible to the hundred millionth decimal place, and its divisibility is rather arbitrary anyway. It's just that 100,000,000 of the smallest units are known as 1BTC, and about 2.1 quadrillion (10^15) units will ever exist. If the smallest unit somehow becomes too valuable for everyday usage, BTC can be divided, but all other existing wealth would be inversely multiplied. Relative to each other, everyone would still have the same wealth but BTC would now be more divisible.

You actually can create an nLockTime transaction for funds to be released later, send the bytes of that transaction to the receiver and the receiving party can store and broadcast the transaction at a later date when it wants payment. To cancel the subscription, the funds will have to be emptied out of the wallet.

Oh, wow.
It was pretty easy to show taint on one of my own mixed transactions using their service (Blockchain.info will subtract a multiple of a static fee, such as 0.0005, 0.0010... which makes it easy to find the actual coin destinations) and I'm not surprised at all that, once you can identify Blockchain's mixing transactions, you can taint all of the coins used in their mixing service. On top of that, they charge a lot (~$0.30 per tumble, 2 tumbles minimum) for a scam service.
I didn't see him mention anything about the fees for the service which is how I was able to prove a relationship between a set of my own mixed coins. If you can can figure out whether an input into a SharedCoin transaction is from a 3rd party and not from another part of the mixing service, you can figure out where that input is supposed to go just by searching the same or next block for a similar amount of coins but subtracted by a multiple of 0.0005. For example:
Someone sends 1.003 BTC into the mixer, and it is obvious that it's being sent into Blockchain's mixer
I search for an address receiving a similar amount of BTC subtracted by a certain fee, such as 1.0025, 1.002, 1.0015, 1.001, etc...
The coins are now tainted despite mixing effort. This works as long as the amount is pretty unique.

One way to do it is to use some words as an out address, which is the "lazy" way to do this. The "script" can be up to 1.84 * 10^19 bytes long but you have to pay a fee for every whole kilobyte in the transaction and for the remaining bytes.

1) Multibit does phone home looking for updates. It has no offline mode.
Multibit has no reason to ask for a specific balance, but it needs to find a block that holds a transaction related to your wallet's addresses. It probably goes through every block so it probably won't leak any information.
Your transactions, however, can be monitored by your ISP and by any other forces allowing you to connect to the internet. They can see where the funds are coming from and where they are going along with your IP. Transactions are not encrypted but they also can't be changed so it's not a security issue, just a privacy issue.
2) Transactions go to whichever nodes you're connected to. Some record the origin of their transactions, like the nodes at Blockchain.info.

Wallet software could be made to regenerate nLockTime transaction. I'm sure automation will find a way.


Each person could be given a wallet for them to keep secure. The whole idea is messed up if some are not interested in Bitcoin anyway.


Perhaps the transaction should signed to be sent (with nLockTime transactions) to multiple agencies specializing in Bitcoin inheritance. This is the same trust problem again, but the situation is slightly better since one agency can only steal part of the wealth.

Iceland? No.


I think this guy is misunderstanding Iceland's relation to the EU and the EFTA. Although the UK and The Netherlands denominated their debts in Euros, the author should be using the approximate ISK figure (15000-20000K ISK) and not EUR one just to be clear about money in Iceland. This is just a little nitpick but I think that phrasing it the wrong way may cause people to be further confused about Iceland's sovereignty.
That being said, this doesn't belong in @_date: 2014-07-02 04:53:11

Tax treaties. US citizens living abroad must file their taxes with the IRS and local government but they might not owe anything to the US if they are making less than about $100k per month.

You could probably execute a will. A living person could move a wealth of bitcoins before the timelocked transaction gets executed. Keep repeating this and when the user is dead or otherwise incapacitated, the coins will be moved to someone else's wallet.
If propagation isn't very good for long periods of time, then the bytes of the signed transaction could be recorded and given to the receivers or random people for propagation at a later date.

@_date: 2014-05-31 00:57:53


Yep. It's technically not a valid transaction before block X so I think the transaction would temporarily be stuck in limbo (miners can't accept the invalid transaction) before being eventually lost. All you would need to do is save transaction to disk so it can be propagated manually at a later date. I haven't heard of any software that allows save transactions but I'm sure it's an easy job.


That's all you need to do to prevent the transaction from being valid when block X comes around. So long as you're alive and otherwise mentally capable of handling the money (duh), you can move it periodically.

No, the decision doesn't specifically imply this. There could be so many reasons as to why Apple decided to do this. It may simply because of negative PR or because Apple thinks it can get more customers by softening its censorship policy for apps. Corporations are amoral and you can't assume it's because Apple did it "out of the good of its heart".
