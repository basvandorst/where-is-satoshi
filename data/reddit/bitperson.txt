Change the dosage dude! ;) 
Things will slowly change and adapt. No worries.

Which one has more fees?
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:45:15
Fees, and I think Mining pools will provide unique features in the future for a cost. Perhaps merchants will pay small fees to have a pools quickly check a transaction, confirm it's not a double spend, and promise that they will attempt to get it in the next block even if a competing double spend is attempted with bigger fees.

To be anonymous if needed. When you send a payment you actually reveal your ip address to everyone.

True, but unlike actual limited resources, the supply of alternatives is endless and actual physical objects are useful for making things. 
You could almost look at Bitcoin like "gold" but instead of the cliche LTC is "silver" perhaps LTC is "another gold" since they essentially do the same thing.

Unless you know the key you entered to sync it I think you will have to verify your account by emailing them.

It's a device that signs transactions so private keys never have to be on a computer and vulnerable to viruses etc. Makes it hard for your BTC to be stolen.

I get what you are doing but I'm almost certain people want simplicity. I think people will just move the decimal and give it a name instead as the value of BTC increases.
