I didn't say they were fascists.  I said that they are "acting like a bunch of fascists."  Understand the difference and don't give me you bullshit.

Do you find any irony in calling these people antifascist--- when they are acting like a bunch of fascists?

You are right the article is old and its probably the case the Iran has ceased its massive counterfeit operation.  Its just a reminder, however, that Iran as a state counterfeited billions of US dollars.

This is exactly right.  What you have at these rallies is people very much acting like the brownshirts before Hitler came to power.  The fascists had a substantial amount of violent 'rioting' and fighting in the streets especially with communists in Germany during the 1930's.  NAZI representatives in the Reichstag caused complete chaos by boycotting votes and behaving much in the same way as the Dems (but to a greater extent) in the last couple of weeks.

So, its OK to injure or kill? Trump supporters?  Is it OK to injure or kill Bitcoin supporters?  And its OK to do this because some of Trump supporters beat up a hispanic man in Boston?

I like Bitcoin and all.  
But, John McAfee is a crazy person who has fried his brains with an excess of narcotics.  As an aside, he is probably a murderer.   So, you may not want to take investment advice from him.

Do you think that if people had more direct control over EU representatives, the EU would continue to exist or at least continue to do the things that it does.  I sure don't.  The only way the EU continues to exist is if it remains undemocratic.  At every turn, voters refuse to sign up for a more powerful EU and "giving less power to your own government."  There are reasons why the EU has the procedures which are undemocratic.
