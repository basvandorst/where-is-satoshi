Seizures of USD happens every single day in this country when it's connected with drug dealing. Get your head out of your ass.

With it being legal now, insurance companies will definitely impose stricter security measures. Hopefully that helps, but I know in California those places were getting robbed a lot.

I don't need to buy my drugs with BTC my god everyone. Yall are some big nerds.

Just because numbers are up doesn't mean a thing. It matters if they were above or below *expectations*

I just don't like the idea people can see where I send my coins.

It clearly says on the Overstock image that USD were paid.

TMZ is used as an example. What if I go buy coffee with my BTC doesn't that merchant get my address?

Please stop while you're ahead. And by ahead I mean have girl in your user name so guys think you're a girl and want to stick it in your butt.

Your story might grab more headlines if you said you were carrying like 10k instead. Add in some gun shots too, maybe a gay slur. 
You'll be on the front page with those corrections!

I wonder how many times in the next 10 years the Fed will seize the same coins over and over. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:50:37
So some clerk at a store doesn't get my address when I buy coffee?
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:21:41
google wallet?
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:01:32
You want some more?
@_date: 2014-01-17 22:27:46
And by using and accepting them into the network you've basically said ok to the Fed seizing them anytime they desire.

Schoop was the man.

What's the female version of a fedora?

Sad indeed. We need more privacy.

How are people able to see what coins an exchange like Mt gox has but they couldn't see a single person history? Doesn't make sense to me...

It's going to be really funny when companies start paying employees in Bitcoin and the value drops big on a Monday after payday. Your 2k paycheck might be worth 250 bucks in the matter of a day. 
There will be a lot of people crying to their HR departments.

50 Million of Google is a fart in the wind...It's market cap is 370 billion. 
So no, that would not move the price a tiny bit.
