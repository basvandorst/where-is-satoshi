You're crossing into borderline troll territory so I'm probably going to stop after this reply.  You either have to have not been paying attention for the last year or just cant connect the dots because things are happening all over wall st. in preparation for them to enter the market in a big way.  Dont take my word for it though, maybe tag this post to check up on in a year and we'll see who was right.

I probably use 3-4 different wallets at any given time, coinbase included.  Right now I buy with coinbase, transact with Mycelium and screw around with Greenaddress and Blockchain.  Doesn't mean I have a lot stored in wallets like Coinbase, or even Mycelium where I can control the keys.  The bulk is in cold storage but I still responded in the survey that I use Coinbase to store some coins.

I have also [hosted] ( some [successful]( tipping [threads](  I have only ever received positive feedback and had a great time doing it.  I also agree that it is a great way to promote adoption.  
Dogecoin had one thing right, smaller denominations makes using the currency fun because you can reward people with real karma.  Its cool because you can customize how much you want to reward them for their comment or story and even tailor it using custom monikers to make it a joke or more relevant to their comment.
I think it would be a great idea to reach out to other popular subreddits and use those custom monikers to make it very relevant to their fan base.  1 headshot in 1 curiosity rover in 10 fuzzy bunnies in whatever.  You can set the name and amount for each moniker and it really blows peoples minds.

Millibit becomes Kilobit.  Bit, Kilobit and Bitcoin.  That's all that's really needed.  You would no longer refer to things as Millibits because a full bitcoin is no longer the base unit, bits/ubits are now so you would count up from there instead of counting down from a full BTC.

Here's some to play around with to get more comfortable.  
1 roll Security is important with bitcoin but it's not that difficult.  I would purchase using coinbase and enable 2FA on your account.  One you have coins send them to a mobile wallet that allows you to hold onto your private keys like mycelium and follow their backup instructions.  If you end up purchasing more than a few hundred dollars worth you will want to look into what's known as cold storage but the community here would be happy to help you one you're ready.

Two Factor Authentication.  When you log into your account, etc. you will have to enter a code that was sent to you by SMS or from your authenticator app (I recommend google authenticator) to make sure it is actually you who is trying to access your account.

Right now (Phase 1: price discovery) bitcoin acts more as a commodity/deflationary store of wealth, i.e. it is a commodity in the fact that it is traded on the open market and influenced by buy/sell orders like a normal stock would be.  It is a store of wealth in that there is only a limited number that will ever exist and since the supply has a hard cap (the exact opposite of the USD which has about 80 billion issued every month) the price is solely dictated by the demand/adoption.  Since it functions as a better form of money adoption is increasing globally at an exponential pace (maybe not as visible here in the US where our currency is relatively stable and there are several payment options but bitcoin is a global currency and there are a lot of countries that are in chaos right now because their governments are destroying their currencies via inflation or people have no access to banks/atms like in africa).  With increasing adoption and fixed supply price is forced upwards dramatically and will often overshoot its "true" valuation and correct hard (i.e. bubbles) but the overall trend is still very much in the positive direction.  
Phase 2 for bitcoin will be reaching global market saturation at which point it will stay relatively stable in value and only increase or decrease in value based on global economic growth and/or loss of supply from coin mismanagement (although this should greatly decrease with new multisig services that are rolling out).  
[This is a great video]( that discusses in more detail the phases I mentioned above.  


As I said above, we are still in phase 1 at this point so bitcoin will function more as an investment for now (that also happens to be useful for making payments), it behaving as a stable currency will come later.  
In terms of utility, think about travel as an example.  I can already book flights &amp; hotels with bitcoin, etc. but when it comes down to it once bitcoin has global merchant acceptance I wont even need my wallet anymore, I can just use my smartphone to pay for everything and there is no currency conversion if I travel from the US to Brazil to Russia to China, etc. the same bitcoin can be accepted anywhere.  With visa, google wallet, etc. there is still currency conversion going on behind the scenes and you lose with fees/exchange rate in the process.  
Not only that but accepting bitcoin allows merchants to eliminate the 1-3% fees that the credit card companies charge and they will eventually be able to pass this on to consumers directly.  Right now I can buy bitcoin with a 1% fee from coinbase and turn right around and spend it on amazon for 3% back through gyft so I actually save 2% overall rather than just using my credit card.  Other companies (snapcard I think?) already offer 6% off when purchasing using bitcoin.  The cost advantage may not seem like much but it only has to be slightly better than current payment methods for merchants &amp; consumers to gradually adopt it due to their own economic self interest.  As that happens the network effect just makes bitcoin more and more valuable as the dollar continues to decline from inflation.  Eventually there will be a tipping point where people/companies/governments will realize they either need to get with bitcoin or they will be left behind.  It doesn't really matter at what point they adopt bitcoin though, they will still see the benefits (growth) of a deflationary currency until global saturation is reached, its just the later they choose to adopt the smaller the extent of the benefits will be.  
A lot of the other benefits of bitcoin are things that will probably not be fully understood by consumers such as decentralization (i.e. there is no central authority controlling/manipulating the value of their money) but what they will understand is that bitcoin is gaining value while their dollars can buy less and less.  
Let me know if you have any other questions.

I think fountains are way underutilized.  If I was an early adopter with 1000+ coins I would totally dedicate a nice chunk to just hand out in bits to anyone who wanted them.  The difficulty people have in getting their hands on them the first time is a big hindrance to adoption because they can usually see it is a better form of money once they get to use it but many give up because it is not intuitive to acquire.

What if the core protocol always collected the block reward and handled the distribution automatically based on the submitted hashing power?  Then there is no advantage to pooled mining.  Essentially bitcoin core becomes the only pool.

Not necessarily in my opinion.  The blockchain in this case becomes the trusted settlement service primarly handling larger value transactions (pushing out the dust transactions).  The payment providers operate in a totally free market with coin holders able to leave at any moment to the competitor with the lowest fees, highest security, best reputation, easiest UI, personal key storage with multisig, etc.  Eventually the best and most efficient business model wins.

Yes, I have witnessed it first hand as I have been holding coins for over a year, and the volatility I have seen has been very much in the positive direction.  [This is a great video](  explaining bitcoins growth patterns.  
Here's some to play around with, try transferring it between wallets and you may see what I mean about it being a better form of money.  
1 roulette I could send coins from the US to China to Brazil to Russia to Australia to Iceland to India and back in less than a day if I wanted.  Impossible with current methods of money transfer.

Too bad the FAA just shut that down, even for amazon.  Although I suppose if we can decentralize it there's not much they could do to stop it.  Looking forward to seeing some progress made on this front.  3d printers that make other 3d printers that then 3d print massive numbers of drones all running decentralized open source delivery software?

"Any institutional investor who is a fiduciary needs to hold some bitcoin, because it is a possibility that this becomes the main currency of the world" 3:55
"Its more efficient than using credit cards or dollars or any currency that's tied to any government.  This is a very exciting time and it's a technology that i see coming up that really has an amazing future to it, I'm very interested in financial technologies, new financial technologies, because I think the banking world and the investment banking world and the venture capital world are all going to be completely transformed in the next 3 or 4 years." 7:20
"This is as transformative to finance as the internet was to information and communications." 8:42
Also according to the interviewer [Reid Hoffman]( cofounder and chair of LinkedIn: "Bitcoin is the  trend on my mind." 6:40
Near the end there is a portion where he gives high praise to Elon Musk on SpaceX, Tesla, Hyperloop, etc. "If he wants to do another startup I'm ready to back him day 1" "I'll give him money and he can do whatever he wants with it" 11:10

I actually spoke to an attorney recently who was recommended by skyhook about getting an ATM network set up.  He said there are a handful of states, maybe 4-5 (mine being one of them) that have greatly reduced regulations regarding obtaining a money transmitters license.

You can set up a self directed 401k (esssentially the same as a rollover) through broad financial if you are self employed in some aspect (I did it to access my old 401k from a former employer and qualified because I own rental property but there are other ways to qualify as well).

A combination of realizations;
* distributed (no central control to manipulate it and cant be shut down) 
* not tied to any country (which means it can be used by all countries) 
* there is a finite amount that can exist but infinite divisible
* transfers globally instantaneously for nearly free
* secured by cryptography
* can have services built on top of it because it is a value transfer protocol
* already had more processing power than all the supercomputers
* unsiezeable, you alone decide what is done with your money (assuming you have proper security)
* allows access for the unbanked
* etc...

Yea I have heard stories like this about the coinbase mobile app not immediately sending payments.  I use the coinbase mobile app to purchase coins since they make that part easy at least but I immediately send them to a different wallet after they arrive (partly because Coinbase holds your keys which is always a risky proposition).
Blockchain is pretty good, it's secure and sends coins instantly, but their UI could use a little polish in my opinion and I don't like how it displays my balance (including watch only addresses) when I'm sending a payment to someone, if they glanced at my phone they could see how many coins I own.  I recently switched over to mycelium and they seem to have a really good product but I've had my eye on greenaddress.it as well.  Don't really have much experience with either but a lot of people really like mycelium (they have a local trader function too which was another selling point for me) and greenaddress has some cool multisig features.  
I think blockchain is a good place to start for mobile and you can branch out later if you find something else that looks interesting.

bitcointip usage dropped off when the price achieved low earth orbit because everyone saw the price of their coins appreciating so quickly.  When we started reentry they also held on to their coins because they saw how valuable they could eventually become.  I think changetip will take off because throwing around bits and satoshi's is fun because it's easy and not a big financial commitment.  Dogecoin had it right on that one.  100 bits @_date: 2014-05-08 17:21:41

I agree with on this one, the only thing proven about Brock (as far as I am aware) is that he had some shady friends when he was a teenager.

Without pay? Their pay was to con people with a limited understanding of economics into buying into their inflating coin by dangling a cute dog meme in front of them. I'm sure the huge (if temporary) increase in coin value was more than enough to have them laughing all the way to the bank.

Follow up question.  If by chance there was some problem with your RNG would an attacker be able to spend the coins sent to a 2of3 address generated with Entropy?  Or would splitting it into 2of3 prevent them from sweeping coins even if the RNG was compromised?

If they truly understand bitcoin they probably realize that it will threaten them in the long term if it is globally adopted.  This move would most likely make them the  holder behind satoshi which is a position of power they would want to be in.  I don't think they care about making less than a billion dollars right now, what they should care about is being one of the biggest players in the future global currency system.

By the time we are reaching full global adoption there wont be a dramatic crash like in the early stages of price discovery, it will just be a slow increase to full saturation.  [This is a great talk]( that describes the S-curve phenomena and how volatility will dampen over time.

I can confirm this.  I have dealt with guys who would personally go out of their way to create conflict just to watch it unfold.  As an example when I was younger there was a guy who I thought was my friend start stealing my stuff and then blamed his friend for the crime.  He then encouraged me to physically confront his friend just to watch the two of us fight it out and only intervened when I had pinned him and was in a position to inflict serious damage.  This was just one of numerous instances of him completely backstabbing me but he always had a believable (at the time) rationale for his actions that deflected blame onto others.  Really opened my eyes to the ways of the world and made me jaded towards others seemingly benign intentions.  People have to earn my trust now instead of it being automatically given until broken.

And just as many to the contrary.  If we want reversibility we can add the parties on top of the protocol that will assume that risk.  We have that option because irreversibility is a core component of the protocol.  Fiat doesn't have the option of being instantaneous and also irreversible because at its core everything is reversible.

Hey BashCo, I was thinking it would be a cool idea if we could somehow encourage people to start tip threads in their local subreddits to grow the user/merchant base in their local communities (although I'm not sure the best way to organize it, maybe giving them $10 to hand out in bits once the thread is established?).  [I did one a few weeks ago]( in and it was very well received overall.  I think a lot of potential users are hesitant to trust bitcoin since it is somewhat of a nebulous entity not tied to any country or organization and hosting tip threads in local subreddits gives it more of a community feel and helps people imagine using it in their area.  Just a thought, but I think people getting their hands on a few bits to play around with is one of the best ways to promote adoption and I'm open to any ideas towards that goal.

Late adopters would still see slower deflationary growth until full saturation is reached and even then growth would model the planetary economic growth.  Their other option would be to remain in inflating fiat so switching is still a win even for late adopters.

A simple solution would seem to be off chain transactions with trusted third parties (don't hit me) that settle once a day, etc. on the blockchain.  It would be taking a risk to trust a third party to hold coins but ones that proved insecure would fail and the secure/reliable/trustworthy ones would take their market share.  This risk could probably also be mitigated by people gravitating towards third parties that used services like multisig, insurance, etc.

Good questions.


Yes.  Finite supply doesn't matter in terms of utility because bitcoin is infinitely divisible.  If there was only 1 bitcoin that existed on earth because all the others had been destroyed it alone could still store and transact all the wealth of the planet.  


It is much less of an issue than the centralization of wealth that we have currently.  Bitcoin operates in a completely voluntary basis since no one can confiscate/block/intercept/delay bitcoin payments which allows for free innovation and competition with no barrier to entry in the marketplace.  That is not the case with the current system as the global elite have put up huge barriers to innovation for anything that competes with their monopolized interests thereby allowing them to continue hoarding more wealth and suppressing the population with the debt necessary to operate in their structured and protected framework.  
A 1%er in the bitcoin world can use his wealth to invest and grow but he cant force others to use his services since if he abuses his power a competitor is free to create a competing service.  This will drive efficiency across the entire marketplace as companies race to have the lowest fees, best customer service, fastest response times, etc. to get any edge on the competition.  The current system promotes monopolies which have no incentive to innovate (Comcast anyone?) because no one is allowed legally/financially to compete with them, and if someone does get a toehold into their monopoly (Aereo?) they just "lobby" (bribe) politicians to pass laws which act to their sole benefit.  Our current system is completely owned by the rich and once that structure is changed to allow for free innovation we will truly see the next global renaissance.

Had to pay a stack of bills last night and was only partially successful for the following reasons;
* Several companies were only open 9-5 for payment processing (guess what, I work during those hours).  They even had an automated call center addressing any other inquiry I could make but cant figure out how to let me make a credit card payment after 5pm? 
* Some companies required a pin in order to access their payment portal (which I don't have and there was no link to reset it) such as the toll company for my commute to work.  Seriously you can take a picture of my license plate at 80mph and auto generate my bill but you cant give me a simple interface to enter my account number and credit card and be done with it.  
I swear its like these companies dont even want my money, what kind of fucked up logic has companies putting up roadblocks to accepting payment.

Coinbase is definitely legit and the best method of purchasing coins in the US using a bank transfer.  The reason that people recommend that you transfer your coins out of coinbase after you have purchased them is because coinbase holds your private keys when you use their wallet.  This means you are basically accepting an IOU from coinbase that they will give you your coins when you ask for them. 
 If coinbase were to ever cease to exist for any reason you would have no recourse to get your coins.  Other wallets such as blockchain.info and mycelium allow you to store your private keys so even if they go under you can still access your coins.  
In general though it is recommended that you dont keep any more on a mobile wallet than you would be comfortable carrying on you in cash for "on the go" spending.  Anything in excess of that which you are using for "savings" should be transferred to an offline wallet (also known as cold storage or paper wallet).  [Here is a good guide]( for paper wallet creation

90% of bitcoins will have been mined by ~2019 and 99% by ~2032, it will take over 100 years to mine the last 1% of bitcoins.  While you are correct that it will not be truly deflationary until the last coin is mined it will for all intents and purposed behave as a deflationary currency in the very near future.

I met a guy recently who is a VC in several internet companies, drives a Tesla, etc. and the topic of bitcoin came up (not sure how exactly).  I am lauded as the local bitcoin expert by my friends and he was curious about it but the first thing he asked me was "didn't the CEO commit suicide or something?".  It's shocking to me how misinformed the general public (even the seemingly tech inclined) is but I'm guessing that's because its so exciting to me that I'm trying to absorb everything I can about it.

If they dont offer discounts one of their competitors will probably see the opportunity to cut into their market.  They still dont have to allow discounts at that point but it is at their own peril.

Hey.  I started that thread and gave you your second tip.  Don't feel obligated to respond to this dude harassing you, I don't know what it is but some people get a hard on trying screw with dogecoiners.  If he was in a thread I started I wouldnt have been nearly as polite in my replies as you have been.  Its sad I feel like I have to apologize for the behavior of some users around here, honestly it is hard to tell the trolls apart from the anal retentive sometimes but normally they're called out on their behavior.  Anyway, hopefully this won't discourage you too much from trying to participate in the future, if anybody gives you trouble send em my way!  :P

The majority of small transactions (micropayments, satoshi dice, etc.) can move off blockchain while reserving high value transactions for the blockchain which will significantly delay the need to update the 1MB limit.  I am confident they will be able to adequately address it and I am encouraged that they are taking a more measured approach.  
@_date: 2014-06-16 14:59:44

A county can have a temporary effect on the exchange rate but the only way to truly destroy bitcoin would be to shut down the internet and take out Garzik's cubestats.  Even then you would have blockchain transactions being broadcast over AM radio, etc. so I would say it is probably impossible to completely destroy at this point.

I agree they are doing great things and this is an awesome feature but the fact remains if they ever folded for whatever reason (however unlikely I think that may be) your coins would be gone even if they are locked in their "vault".  Until they enable user key management as an option I can't consider storing any large amount of coins with them.

Mycelium allows you to store your private keys which is critical.  You should be the only one who has access to your keys.  Also, it has a good user interface and lot of features.  Plus it has the "local trader" option which lets you find people buying and selling bitcoin in your area, kind of like a bitcoin craigslist.  
@_date: 2014-06-29 12:40:47
One thing I've been curious about, I am currently debt free aside from my mortgage and while I could sell a good portion of my bitcoin holdings and pay it off I would prefer to hold on to my coins as I firmly believe they will appreciate in value.  If I continue to hold my coins and still have my mortgage when the dollar implodes what are the ramifications for me?  Will I no longer be able to pay it back and it will create all kinds of problems?  Will it just go away because the bank will collapse?  Not sure how this situation would play out.  
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:41:33
WTF dude, who gives a crap?  He's not pumping anything btw.  He's probably here in part due to a tipping thread I started in dogecoin trying to show them we all aren't uptight assholes who background check any person who shows the slightest interest in participating in our community, jesus.

I haven't discounted the possibility that the government grabbed them in the same way they claimed authority over the silk road coins.  Gox was the most popular exchange for the period when SR was in it's prime so I could see how the govt could make their own logical leap that those coins belonged to them as well.  In my opinion most likely because they saw that Bitcoin is something they are not going to be able to squash so they needed to get their stake secured under the guise of the war on drugs.  Mark isn't talking blockchain details because he is under explicit instruction from the govt not to.  Just my theory.

A certain percentage of people who try bitcoin will become believers, mainly because it truly is better money but it is much more likely they will realize this by using it instead of studying it like most of us have.  This is why I think tipping is so important, just getting a small amount of bitcoin in someone's hands to play with is much better than lecturing them for an hour on why it is an improvement over current forms of money. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:02:06
There isn't.  Even though they won't admit it, the assholes who yell the loudest about how they have been so wronged by doge secretly love the drama.

I feel partly responsible for the treatment you are receiving in this thread as I approached the doge community with open arms (and met some awesome shibes in the process!!) because I thought we were long overdue for  mending wounds.  The actions of some in this thread would lead me to believe I acted too soon but I don't buy that, they are a very small and unfortunately hostile and vocal minority and I apologize for their behavior.  Doge love really is infectious, I hope you guys will consider sticking around to lighten up the place.    1000 bits @_date: 2014-06-25 19:20:38

Crowdfunded bitcoin marketing.  Sort of like a wiki or kickstarter for collaboration and fundraising for targeting specific sponsorships.  People can propose ideas and vote on the best ones similar to reddit, funding can be held in escrow by the site while taking a commission and is dedicated towards the goal of open community collaboration on promotion of bitcoin.  
It should have an open database/wiki of established marketing materials (flyers, posters, business cards, promotional videos, etc.), proposals for specific markets (global locations for planting seeds of adoption, sporting events, giveaways, etc.), contact database, form letters for media promotion and pitches to owners, etc.

Agreed its more personable this way but also less sustainable because it takes constant effort.  I really believe a lot of people would like to play around with bitcoin but the barrier to entry is sometimes daunting so they never do it.  Once you're able to get your hands on it though you're usually hooked.  It would be nice if the faucet was there just to make it easy for everyone to get their hands on a few bits (like a sidebar link).  We could still do a weekly giveaway thread (or even better pin one to the top of the subreddit) but the faucet could serve as an easy onramp in the meantime.  Just a thought.

Say I take 100 coins from Bitcoin 1.0 and move them over to alternate chain Bitcoin 2.0.  Bitcoin 2.0 then doubles in value relative to 1.0 and I move my coins back to 1.0.  Would I then have 200 coins on 1.0?  It seems like that would not be possible considering the 21MM hard cap on 1.0.

Also, I think there are better resources than what I linked for paper wallet creation (ideally in an ELI5 format for newcomers).  
I also wanted to include a section offering free bitcoins for newcomers to play with and thought about linking my "who wants bits?" thread but figured I would probably be flooded with requests and I both value my free time and am not made of money  :P  
I feel like there should be fountains out there that dont require you to solve captchas in order to get a few coins to play around with but I'm not aware of any (we really need to get on developing this if it doesn't exist.  I'm thinking of a site where people can donate a few millibits to be distributed to newcomers automatically kind of like the automated node creation page).  
Anyway, just a few thoughts, hopefully something comes of it.

For android I'd recommend purchasing bitcoin with the coinbase app (if in the US and you don't mind revealing your personal info).  After you purchase I'd use mycelium over blockchain.info for your mobile wallet.

How does robocoin realistically expect to compete with the likes of Skyhook?  At about 1/15 the price of a Robocoin and with much less intrusive AML/KYC measures I dont see them offering any serious competition to Skyhook.  The natural trend will be towards less expensive atms, the faster we get there so they can be more broadly distributed the better.

1. Silkroad seizure was technically justifiable in their opinion, they would have a much harder time making the case for how this seizure was justified.  
2. They are publicly auctioning off their SR coins since the seizure was also public, the Gox coins however may be for their personal stake for use at a later date (for what purpose only they would know).  
If the US gov wants something bad enough the databases not being on US soil isn't going to stop them.  They have no problem hacking into Chinese databases and I doubt it would be that difficult to convince our ally Japan that it was in everyone's best interest for them to get a handle on this new "money laundering and drug dealing" tool before it had a chance to spread.

The great thing about bitcoin in the event of a dollar collapse is that world governments would never be able to come to a consensus on what the new world currency would be because they would all have their own self interests at play.  Bitcoin wins out in this scenario because it is neutral and can be chosen by the people with the decree of their government.

I admit, when doge first came around i contributed to the hostility myself because it looked like doge was created in the same light as buttcoin as an attempt to discredit the work we are doing.   Since then though Doge has proven that it really is a vibrant community making important contributions to crypto so by now all this hostility is really fucking pointless and I wish we could move past it.

It's probably obvious that the duct tape mockup is hurting the crowdfunding.  My guess is they were excited to show off what they've accomplished and rushed this video out but it's really not that hard to make a cutout out of wood, metal or whatever and it would look a lot more professional.  One of the first rules of business is you have to sell your customer on the idea of the product even more so than the product itself and presentation goes a long way to achieving that.  
That being said, I really like the idea of the NFC payment, this is the digital currency revolution after all, right?  But my guess is the bill collector will still be necessary for broader adoption as the portion of the public who is tech savvy enough to pay for things with NFC using google wallet is probably going to be buying from coinbase already if they want bitcoin exposure.  Also you are introducing chargeback risk it seems by accepting digital payments.

Haha sorry.  I was thinking of just putting it in a reddit post but wanted to run it by you first and maybe let you submit it for feedback.  Could email it but didn't know if you would want to share your address.  Google drive was the next best option but I forgot to change the privacy settings.  It should work now.

Agreed on all points.  The drug war is the most destructive exercise in futility I have ever witnessed (although there are certainly some other govt programs I could put in the same basket as well).  Hoping for a fair trial but I'm sure they will try to make an example of him and layer on some new laws with no basis in reality in the process.  Cannot stress how excited I am for the changes the blockchain is going to bring.  Hard to stay patient.

Each confirmation is a block of transactions that was built on top of your transaction.  Each block is locked using cryptography and it gets exponentially harder to undo transactions the more blocks they have on top of them.  After 1 confirmation it is essentially impossible to undo.

Not sure who ended up getting the tip, maybe it was instead but I'm not sure, that wasn't my intention at least.

Much appreciated crypto brother.

I only took a 15 minute stab at it, really needs more work and I would be happy to put more time in if I knew it was being seriously considered.  
@_date: 2014-06-06 19:01:39
[Here is my first stab at it](  Some sections are still a little light (such as desktop wallets because I dont have as much experience with them) so I was thinking it would be useful if you were to submit it as a suggested update and then ask for feedback from the community, incorporate the best feedback and then update the sticky.  Feel free to edit however you see fit, I just wanted to get the ball rolling.

Paypal is centralized control of your funds.  Maybe you saw the thread last week on the front page about "what company has lost your business forever"?  Paypal was the  &amp;  responses out of several thousand comments with many horror stories following about paypal essentially straight up stealing people's money by siding with scammers even when presented evidence by the merchant.  They have also chosen to just confiscate, block, or hold funds in limbo for months for no apparent justifiable reason.  There is a reason they are disliked and that people are shifting to bitcoin because with bitcoin you are eliminating the middleman (PayPal) who you are essentially accepting an IOU from when it comes to accessing your money.  With bitcoin you alone decided when and where your money moves and you don't need permission from anyone to do so. 


Ultimately its up to each individual whether they want their money stored in an inflationary or deflationary currency.  Bitcoin is volatile because its young and going through a process of price discovery that will take several years but overall the trend has been over 1000% growth every year.  I have had a portion of my wealth stored in bitcoin for over a year now and while volatile on a daily basis I have no complaints whatsoever about the annual growth.  Inflation would eat at least 2-3% purchasing power from dollars sitting in PayPal every year.  As I said, it is up to each person to decide but I can tell you I personally choose Bitcoin.  


This is actually untrue.  Paypal transactions can be reversed weeks later so they are not really confirmed irreversible for over a month.  Bitcoin is irreversible after approximately 10 minutes.  


I would suggest reading satoshis white paper and researching the byzantine generals problem.  This was a problem in computer science that was thought unsolvable for decades until satoshi found a solution using the blockchain and allows for a trustless ledger that has never been possible before in history and has enormous implications for everything from smart contracts, verifiable voting, distributed autonomous corporations, transfer of ownership title, stock issuance, etc. all done without the need for third party intermediaries.  
Bitcoin is a protocol in the same way TCP/IP is a protocol and will become one of the fundamental building blocks of the internet.  The difference is that it wasn't possible to purchase a share of something like TCP/IP, but bitcoin gives you an ownership stake in a distributed consensus protocol.  The magnitude of this cannot be overstated and is going to change the world in huge ways.  
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:30:25

Found a mistake I think.  On the timeline Sept 11, 2013 should be Sept 11, 2012.  Other than that looks great.  Also, is it just me or does it look like the graphs of transaction volume and hash rates are switched?
