I guess that's an issue if your looking to dodge taxes but if your above board then I don't see this as a problem
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:06:39
I'm a huge fan of Decreds hybrid system that uses both PoW and PoS. The PoW mine the blocks and secure the network like in Bitcoin but then the PoS stake holders validate those blocks and ensure the miners are not implementing new code that does not follow the consensus rules (hard forks in BTC, like BCH) 
That system gives you a say in the development of the coin if you own some, I really like that especially if I own a high value position. I like to be able to give my input in a meaningful capacity rather than let some devs or majority hash share mining groups control the future of an asset I'm heavenly invested in.

Having a digital asset that cannot be copied and pasted and duplicate for free like other digital assets seems like intrinsic value to me. Just an opinion though maybe it is worthless who knows but I'm very interested and am not selling for now.

Not so difficult when there's only one exchange operating and you have some significant capital.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:21:46
What you gotta do is take that 1000 out when your at 10,000 so that if this shit happens your playing with house money and have already taken your initial investment out. I usually do this in crypto when my investment gets close to quadruple it's initial value. 
Today my portfolio is down many thousands but I have lost nothing, haveing taken profits for the past month systematically when times were good and maintaining the rest as a long position. I am now even able to buy back what I sold over the last few months at a considerable profit if I feel so inclined.

Lol me to, but in 2011. He said yes and I sent him $20. He hit me up recently to say that his wallet balance in USD in now in the 4 figures. I asked if he had gotten into it after I demoed it for him and he said it was all just the $20 I sent him. 
Good and bad I suppose, the whole reason I sent him the $20 was so he could see how it worked for himself and be more confident to pursue his own investment but whatever I guess. 
At the end of the day the only thing I am left thinking when people tell me why the dislike Bitcoin or what a bad investment it is, is that it made me rich beyond my wildest dreams. And not theoretically or in an unrealized way, I mean like money in my bank account and a diverse stock portfolio and now looking at buying real estate in LA all because I spent a few paychecks on buying Bitcoin years ago. 
I still work my day job, and have this whole time but now the difference is I don't have to, I want to.

That's total BS, I regularly deposit and withdraw much more than that and have been for years. I pay my taxes and I have no issues with the government or local authorities. 
Also if your concerned about tax and government when it comes to your Bitcoin trading I suggest you establish yourself as a business. This will allow you to funnel your trading activity through your corporate accounts and pay gains taxes at a severely discounted tax rate compared to filing as an individual. Then you pay yourself a low salary to keep income tax low and wright off everything in your taxes, your car, your food, any losses you made with poor trading, it's all deductable when you are a business. Not to mention if your established in certain states and living and working in other states you can collect some tax subsidies as well.
Almost the entire USA tax code is about how to not pay taxes, just see what you need to do differently on paper to do the same shit your doing now but with much less taxes
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:45:24
They were talking about mining Bitcoin directly by hashing SHA256 What your doing is probably using nice hash to mine other coins allergens and sell that hash power for Bitcoin (that's what nice hash mining is).

I have made a few bucks here and there on lesser cryptos but for the most part I would have been better off holding bitcoin this year rather than trading. There were only a few trades that really shifted the balance back. I traded 1btc for about 100eth around April, that really blew up, and then I bought about 100 ltc with bitcoin which recently turned into a very solid trade. 
The majority of my gains come from holding over time not from trading. These days I keep like a .5 btc balance  for trading bs alt coins and I have a few alts that I like which I hold long as well. Mostly I hold BTC, DCR, LTC ETH and a bit of NEO

Woah not everyone, I soled 1.5 BTC when we hit 11k no regrets, that just made me back everything I ever invested into bitcoin plus 5k for the holidays. Now I’m just playing with the houses money so it’s easier to remain unemotional in my trades. Sure I could have soled those for more later but hey I’m now 100% in the black no matter what happens tomorrow.

@_date: 2017-12-28 06:19:40
Sure that’s a good investment and a good read, I think I’m loosing my point though. In a nutshell I’m just trying to say short term fluctuations are not a concern when taking a long position. 
All I meant by “if you believe in this” is that you believe in the prospect of your long position and are happy to own the btc at the price you payed. 
I think your right though op needs a better grasp on how to handle his finances before I would be able to call anything he is doing investing. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:43:38
Buying higher than current price is not a concern when your buying for a long position and if you believe in this shit. 
The only thing I can consent to is that a person ‘just trying to make ends meet’ should probably not be investing if they cannot afford to loose their capitol but it has nothing to do with being 18. 
I bought my first coin for 300 and a few weeks later it was 250. A few weeks is not a long position.

@_date: 2017-12-07 02:43:55
Any major exchange will allow you to set limit orders. So you put in a limit sell order for 1BTC @ $15,000 and then if the market ever hits that price, even for a few seconds, you’ll trigger a sell.  You can set a limit buy order in the same way. You should never have to make trades in real time, use limit orders. 
Do this in the mornings and before bed and you’ll be day trading. Just reset orders and let them trigger while you live your life. 
I would also stay away from stop loss or margins, too volatile an asset to hedge with such traditional techniques. You’ll get cleaned out in a flash crash scenario.
Just for shits: you can do this on Gemini, GDAX, Bittrex polonix, kracken, and a shit tone of other USA based exchanges. And most of the non US ones too, I just live in the US so that’s what I use.

Be worried about getting robbed and take appropriate precautions like meeting in a public place and not transacting with cash or another medium that is easily stolen.
Make sure your btc transaction has at least 3 confirmations before handing over the money so that the coins are not double spent and you are scammed.
Also don’t bring any private keys in any form to the meeting, only public keys.
Otherwise you should be golden, good luck and have fun meeting a fellow bitcoin enthusiast.

You straight up cannot know what the world would be like without the USA military industrial complex. It sounds like your making a lot of unfounded assumptions.
Also the USA is in massive debt to China, I'm not looking sticky at GDP. Look at the world trade growth trends in the last 10 years and where the investment money is flowing.
Also those health benefits are available to us in Germany as well, for free. Being poor in the USA is a trap. Even being middle class wealth will still land you massive student loan debt which you cannot in fact bankrupt out of.
I can't even believe you would argue that is an acceptable option to go broke or die because of health issues. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:12:37
That really depends on how much money you have in crypto, it’s very worth it if your pockets are deep enough. 
Also although I speak fluent German it is not necessarily required to live in Germany, everyone under 50 years old speaks fluent English.
Not only that but the 20% I do pay in taxes in Germany I get free healthcare, free higher education, and the for mentioned great infrastructure. What was I getting for my tax money in the USA other than paying politicians pensions?
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:57:04
Yeah no problem.
It's really hard for me to say what you should do though because everyone has different financial situations and what might be right for me might not be reasonable or realistic for you. If you wanna use those same values it is profitable but with 40$ worth it might not be worth the effort. For learning purposes though it might be worth it. It all depends on your personal financial situation.
That said though 2% of $40 is like $0.08 and after the trade fees it is likely choser to $0.05 not necessarily worth the hassle of day trading if your looking at time commitment to profit.

IDK man I have lived in the USA for 15 years and I hate the healthcare system. Unless I am unemployed and not making any money the cost of one month of healthcare coverage is about $350 which is about what it costs for a one bedroom apartment in down town Budapest. (And I'm in my late 20s and not sick) if I get sick here I end up buying antibiotics on the internet instead of going to a doctor.
Most of the people I work with are trapped in astronomical debt even though they work full time they will never pay their way out. Most of the USA financial aid benefits for poor people require those people to remain poor and unemployed or the benefits are cut, essentially providing incentive to remain in poverty. The schools are payed for by property tax so the poor areas have underfunded schools furthering the cycle of poverty and ensuring social mobility is not reasonably accessible. For those reasons I have to starkly disagree with "in America you still have great opportunity to get out of [poverty]" it's not impossible but the system is stacked against you in America if you are poor.
The people may own the debt but there is no way that they can afford their share. Each households share must be in the low 6 figures and just because you and I can afford it does not mean the average American could, I would even say they definitely can't. Printing more money to pay the debt would hyperinflate the USD and disproportionately affect the poor. It's just not a real option. 
I am not a fan of my government putting me into debt, which is what happens here. And for what? Education? Healthcare? No those things are privatized here, so what do I get for all this money? 
Not only that but income tax here is outrageous. One year I made 50k I payed the same % of tax as I did in a year I made 500k. What the fuck is that about? It was great for the 500k year but those taxes were definitely impacting my quality of life in the 50k year. (I work freelance with a lot of ot so I do understand that is not the norm, but still it is unacceptable)
On top of all of this, my political views are not reflected by my elected officials and the government in recent memory can be described in a word: embarrassing.
@_date: 2018-05-26 03:55:45
No clue but it took me over a year to mine 1 whole Bitcoin and I used an antminer S3 in 2014.
But still good luck, it's a major mile stone at this difficulty, especially with a laptop. I don't even run that antminer any more.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:39:26
I disagree with that. Living in the USA is not a great experience unless your rich.
The healthcare breakthroughs are a mute point because healthcare is prohibitively expensive for the majority. Literally millions of people.
I'm not even sure it's the largest economy any more, if it is then I would wager not for much longer. China is coming up hard and a lot of world trade and reserve holdings are shifting out of USD and into Yen and Renminbi.
The only thing making the USA most powerful is it's insanely overinflated military. Which I prefer not footing the bill for.
@_date: 2018-05-27 04:12:45
What am I misunderstanding? Does bitcoin not fork because of a lack of consensus on the network so now we have 2 networks running their own version of the protocol they couldn’t agree on.
And it doesn’t stop at 2. it seems like cause for concern how often and easily bitcoin is forked.

Sell orders are just limit sell orders on any exchanges, you should be able to place them on any exchange order book. Just set the amount you wanna sell and at what price you want the sell to trigger at and that's it.
There are some open source bots you can program like GECKO and I think there's a free version of profit tailor. I do recommend doing the trading by hand first though since it's relatively advanced to set up your own bot for trading and it takes quite some tech know how to set it up properly and give it control of a balance on an exchange account.
It's always better to understand how it all works by hand before attempting to automate the process.
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:46:21
I like to sell incrementally, sells a bit at current price then set limit sell order at a few % higher and another higher than that still. 
If the price continues to fall you will have soled a bit already at a higher price and can then decide to buy back at a profit, if it rises you will sell more on the way up and increase your average sell price and not sell you whole load at the potential bottom.
Same goes for buying, if your in a buying mood buy a bit now and set limit buy orders all the way down, if the price drops more you will average down your purchase price to become profitable faster if it goes up you will be able to chose to sell at a profit.
My personal strategy is executed by a bot so I don't need to deal with it but it's basically this: buy whenever the price drops 1.64% below the 20 day smooth moving average and then to double down on that buy every additional 3% it drops from there (max 4x or I run out of money lol) then sell once it's at a 2% profit over the DCA purchase piece max $500 at a time and continue to sell over $500 worth each additional 0.6% it rises over the initial 2% profit but only once every 1800 seconds.  It works surprisingly well in the recent bear market.
WARNING: don't use stop loss or trade on margins, you'll get cleaned out. Stick to limit orders.

Ooooo absolutely not, you want unbiased information not hype and shilling cryed from bag holders. 
In the same way that I would not go to the Apple store to ask what is a good smartphone to buy. 
I'm invested in Bitcoin so have a vested interest in wanting others to also adopt the system and invest. Therefore I cannot be objective and neither can most of the people here. That's the beauty of open source though, you don't need to trust anyone but your own understanding of the protocol.

There's no real risk just forgetting about an account that has not been connected to any of your bank accounts, but I would email support to have them close your account all the way just for peace of mind.
For a solid hot wallet I really like Exodus (Exodus , io) it's great for many coins including my favorite... Decred
For a good cold wallet is go with Trezor or ledger but paper wallets are good too, and a bit cheaper.

Lol I actually did mine 1 BTC between mid 2013-late 2014. 
Took a little over 1 year using a second hand antminer s3 on slushes pool with f2pool and antpool as the backups.
Total cost of hardware + electricity was around $500
(Could have bought 1.86BTC if I just bought them when I bought the miner, no regrets though because I did also buy some and I wanted to mine to learn and thought of it as a hobby not an investment)

That said I do think it is overinflated and overwhelmingly by uninformed "investors" who are gambling on the hopes of making millions over night. 
It's next to impossible for me to tell you if it's a worthwhile investment for you because I have no idea what you financial situation is and what might be right for me might be lunacy for you. I would say if you can afford to put some money in and then not need that money for the next 3 years it is worthwhile.
@_date: 2018-05-11 23:25:27
1. limit buy order is an order you place at an exchange where you set a price like say I wanna buy 0.1 BTC at a price of 8500 I'll set a limit order for 0.1 at 8500 and it will sit on the order book untill the market price becomes 8500, then it will be filled otherwise it will not.
2. 500 was an example since I don't wanna say exactly how much I buy or sell but let's say I buy $100 when my first buy condition is met, then if it drops another 3% I buy $200 more (double down) then if it drops another 3% I buy $300 more (double down again) next 3% drop is $600 (doubles down, 100+200+300) and finally the last double down the bot is allowed to make is for $1,200 
3. Smooth moving average is a basic investment indicator that averages the price movement and plots it in a smooth line, tradingview.com has some great visual representations of this available for free use. It’s just a way to plot data though.
4. DCA is dollar cost average, so in the  example if my bot bought 4x it would be the average price of all the $2,400 btc I bought where if I soled them all I would break even. ( although some were bought cheaper and some more expensive)
5. I start to sell when I am 2% positive over the average purchase price but instead of selling all $2,400 at a 2% profit I limit my bot to only sell $500 worth every 1800 seconds and to only continue to sell if the price increases 0.6% from that first 2% profitable price. That way I attempt to maximize profit on the way up rather than sell it all for just 2% profit.
@_date: 2018-05-10 09:41:51
I'm not sure why there's no one filling this clearly existing demand, i was able to buy 2oz of gold using Bitcoin and even got a better rate than I would have had I used any other payment method. Seems like there's a much higher demand for stocks than precious metals though.
A big thing for me is the trust relationship required for such a transaction though. if it's a start up with no renown or institutional backing then I'm definitely not sending them bitcoins and hoping they make good. For that reason I went to a large New York based exchange to cash out before transferring into the stock account.
It took forever, almost 2 weeks between my sending the BTC to Gemini to sell and the cash being made available to trade on TD Ameritrade because of all the banking verification times. (Withdraw from Gemini to bank=5 days, deposit into TD Ameritrade account = 1+week to become available for spending)
Bitcoin direct would be amazingly faster

You need a good GPU in your pc to mine altcoins which can then be traded for bitcoin. The days of Mining btc directly with a pc are long gone.
If you wanna see how your existing hardware would fare mining you can download the miner from nicehash and run it on your pc, you’ll find out very quick and easy how much your pc can generate.
Might even be worth it if you own the pc anyway and don’t pay for electricity. My GTX 1070 generates about $2 a day worth of BTC

That said, if more people would stick to their moral convictions when they invest, the world would be a much better place.

Yeah for me the $700 I payed for the 1080ti on launch day of the GPU I made back in mining in just 3 weeks, I then transfer the money to Gemini to sell but waited for another month before I actually soled and when I did I used the extra to buy myself the 1070. 
My GPU s have payed for themselves like 15x or so by now. 
But yeah these days I'm also right around 100$ a month. Still totally worth it because when I'm not mining these are great for VR rendering, CGI simming, and videogames

I have been scammed on OB but only when I didn’t use a moderator. Like doing a direct send to a seller and then the seller just leaves the order as accepted. As a buyer my coins are gone and I cannot leave feedback to warn the next chump who is too trusting.
Overwhelmingly I have good transactions and even do place orders with no moderators to vendors I have a history with.

I'm sorry it's not a secure investment. We just watched it crumble and people lose everything not 10 years ago.
You talk about buying a house as if you buy it and it's yours. It takes decades before your payed up and if the value collapses even while you live in the house its completely a liability and can become unaffordable even if you didn't over stretch your budget when you buy. 
Or are you of the opinion that everyone who lost during the housing market collapse was an idiot who had it coming? 
@_date: 2018-10-16 23:25:38
When you sell your coins on coinbase or anywhere you sell to someone who is buying, not to the exchange. They just facilitate the trade for a fee.
If everyone wanted to sell when the price went up then the price would go down because you cannot sell what no one is buying.
You might look into BTC ATM machines in your area, that could be a solution if you need cash and coinbase isn't playing ball, otherwise VPN like people said. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 16:34:38

That's what I did too. Back in early March 2015 I put an extra payday I wasn't counting on into Bitcoin at about $300 per coin. Later that month it was almost $200. I didn't have more money to average down but I didn't want to realize the loss. I just sort of held and forgot about them until early 2017 when I sold 1/5 of my stash to take out double my initial investment. 
Almost all the money I have today is because of buying those few bitcoins back in 2015 lol

The Decred community was recently taking about a proposal to create such an exchange based on attomic swap. No fees, no specific coin to use, just open source peer to peer atomic swap exchange.
I have been trading on a few neo and ethereum DEXs and really like that I don't have to pay withdraw fees and that I keep ownership of assets in the order books, but they all do still charge trading fees. I think in the future these will make room for fully open free peer to peer protocols.

If I take 1BTC and sell it to you at 9am then you take that 1BTC and sell it at 12pm to someone else and they sell it at 7pm again then the volume is 3BTC although only 1 actual BTC is being sold.

I found Gemini very easy to set up with my boa account and the support is responsive which is nice. Mostly I like that the fees don't scale up disproportionately when you try and buy a low denomination amount. (I know it's avoided by using GDAX I just don't like it as much)

It is possible but recommended to use your own wallet. 
A lot of BTC ATM s have time limits on their transfers and there's definitely a lag between submitting a withdrawal from an exchange and that transaction hitting the block chain. By having the coins in your own wallet you can control the timing of the transactions better and won't run into issues as easy
In my experience

I don’t understand your point but I would like to.
My whole point from the start is that I feel they owe me “fair market value at the time of the incident” which, because they offer the bonus in bitcoin and bitcoin was worth about $1600 at the time of the incident, should be about 5x more than they are sending me now.  Am I mistaken or misunderstanding something?
I’m not even following up with coinbase about it beyond a support email. like I said I bought many times back then and this amount is relatively trivial. I was just pointing out that the resolution was laughable and in my opposition unacceptable. 
I would really like to understand how you find this to be an acceptable resolution though. You know my stance but I’m still not clear on yours now. The last message almost sounds like you agreed that they owe me the difference but your not optimistic it will happen? I would love to understand fully what you consider acceptable given the circumstances.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:09:48

I really don't think so, your suggesting a huge industry of miners will just allow the Network to move out of their control. Maybe a fork of Bitcoin will be PoS but no chance that migration goes smoothly. It will fracture the already fractured Bitcoin network even further.
I'm also much more a fan of a hibrid system of PoW/PoS where the miners still secure the network with the PoW mining but the network will be validated by a PoS layer. Just like Decred, it's the most secure network structure while still giving authority over the network to the token holders instead of the miners. That and no forks ever make for a much better "store of value"
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:23:37
What? you misunderstand. the complaint is that they failed to give me the bonus i was promised at the time it was promised. not only would i have received like 5x the amount they are trying to give me now, but i would also be owed btc. 
And i did agree that if the price went down i would be owed $1, that's what i meant by "the case could be made for me to swallow the loss if the price went down" sorry if that was unclear. 
as things stand i maintain that i am owed the difference. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:38:29
I don’t follow your logic, and I did buy a lot in July and way early. 
The fact is that coin base offers a referral bonus IN BITCOIN for a new user referral. They failed to make good on that offer although I upheld my end. I don’t see where you are loosing me. The referral bonus offer clearly states you will revive the bonus in bitcoin. 
If they sent me the bitcoin equivalent at the then market price I am made whole, regardless if it is $1 today or $100 they owe me $10 IN BITCOIN reflecting the time of the referral. I could go on to say they should also refund me the $10 I was charged initially as I did not initiate that purchase or authorize it.
I really am curious if you believe what your saying or are just arguing for the sake of argument.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:36:39

I stake decred (DCR) for around 20% annual return with no counterparty risk. it could be 6 figures if you have enough staking. still much safer than trading if you're not the best day trader. 
It doesn't have to be dcr, u can stake a bunch of different coins for significant returns while providing nothing more than the coins, I just really like decred lol.

correct if your position is at coinbase you do not yet own the bch tokens and have no way to realize the gain. but come January you will have access along with thousands of other people which might cause a steep drop in price if many sell their positions. if your 10 years long though you're probably not doing too poorly, i'm 4 years long and am doing quite well. also took my own advice last night and sold all my bch at $2100 so far it was a good call lol

If you make profitable trades than day trading is profitable, you do understand that gains taxes are only applied to the gains right?

Gains tax will never be more than the gains made, 
@_date: 2019-04-21 19:16:12

When you trade any coin you calculate the gains for that trade, every time. The same way I just discribeded but 50x over if you trade 50x in one day. 
Each trade has a gain or a loss and at the end of the year you report the sum of them as either a gain or a loss on your taxes for that year.

Sorry it was not worth it for you, I put 20$ in BTC into my phone wallet back in 2013 to try it out. I was able to buy a 6$ cup of coffee with it and then like a year later I found a BTC ATM and pulled out $40 in cash. I also bought a Rick and Morty comic with the BTC in 2016. Today the remaining amount I have left in that same wallet is still worth over 100$ and I started with 20$ and pulled out more than 40 already. 
It was worth it for me in the long run but this is looking back 5 years later, I'm reasonably confident if you held for 5 years you might have a similar story.

@_date: 2018-03-03 19:35:27
The way I understand it is: if you buy coin x with coin y you need to pay gains on coin y at the point of sale of coin x in its USD value, then record that as the USD purchase value for coin x so that when you stell or trade coin x later you calculate the gains again. 
The 3,000 loss limit seems a bit arbitrary but then again it's a largely unregulated market at the moment and I would expect that limit to increase with oversight

I like the public ledger, it's nice to be able to see where money is coming from or going to in a world where there is so much mis-information that the truth is not clear.

Download a wallet and replace the install wallet.dat file with the one your recovered from your pawned laptop. When you launch the wallet it should then read from the .dat file and you can see what sorts of btc were left in the wallets.

I bought a bitcoin miners (antminer s3) in 2013 also just to lear and everyone at the time was like this is not profitable and there's no way I'll see an ROI on my 200$ mining hardware.

The proper response is to beget policy change through political involvement, vote against the policy you disagree with. Simply opting out and saying it's because you disagree with the authority of the law is idiotically childish. 
You know there's other governments in place and that Bitcoin is an international system, if your gonna opt out of regulations then just conduct business in a place where you agree with the policy. See what people in China do when their exchange is deemed illegal, they don't just say well I disagree and continue. They move thier business to other countries.
Germany for instance has no gains tax for crypto, I happen to be a citizen so it makes it easy to conduct trading through German accounts, Bitcoin is an international transaction system after all. (Taking money out however is subject to international income taxes in the USA because of tax laws, it sucks but there is no escaping uncle Sam's greedy mits) 
I vote against this tax robbery and I reach out to my Congress rep to express my disapproval, like a civil person. In the mean time sure, I pay high ass taxes, like a "slave" I suppose. 
Just don't forget that your transactions are recorded on a public ledger and when you are investigated there will be no ambiguity in the case the IRS makes.

Carful it's deflationary as a system but currently 12.5 new BTC are minted every 10 minutes meaning they are added to the total supply, meaning BTC has much steeper inflation than USD today. Long term not so much.

Like I said do what you want, it's your porogative to break the law. You might even get a chance to argue the lack of meaning or effect the laws your breaking have to a judge some day down the line but probably not.
Personally I don't agree with some speed limits on my commute and I chose to fly through those areas, the fact that I haven't been pulled over is not evidence that the laws have no meaning or effect. I'm not the only one on the road and to better serve all us motorist the laws exist, just like your not the only one subject to financial gain from crypto currency. If it's fine for you to not pay taxes what about bittrex and their millions per day in revenue? 
Don't forget there's other people around and your part of a community. If you disagree go vote.

Dealing with government backed fiat even in a decentralized exchange still requires following the laws. If the transaction happens in Texas then Texas state, the federal US government and whatever local municipality you operate in all have a clame to taxes and may impose rules on what is and isn't allowed.
It's hard to regulate but it's how things work and just because you can get away with it easily does not make it "work perfectly". if you live somewhere where such transactions are taxed and gains are owed per trade, just pay the taxes. You stealing from everyone if you Dodge them anyway. Don't be a crook because it's easy, all this shit is recorded on a public ledger anyway sooner or later it can be traced to you.

I would buy it on Gemini if your in the USA. I would buy a thousand bucks worth now and set limit orders in thousand dollar increments all the way down and hope you hit then all. 
If you don't at least your last buy will have been near the bottom of the dip.
Either way don't buy it all at once at one price and try and hit the bottom of a dip, you'll miss probably. Set several orders and average down if it drops more

Dodging taxes is stealing from everyone who pays fair taxes. 
Justify it however you want, I know it goes on at a huge scale but just because everyone else does it does not mean it's ok. 
I payed over just 30% income tax last year on an income under 100,000. Feels like robbery but I pay because I am part of this country ever since I moved here and became naturalized. I see the big corporations not paying their shair but if you don't pay your share how can you expect others to be better, lead by example and at the end of the day at least you did right and you can hold people to a higher standard.

People love to speculate, looks to me like the other world markets derive their value from speculation as well.
At least with Bitcoin you don't need some trusted 3ed party to allow you to transact or limit your access to the speculation show.

I don't understand why not invest directly into startups rather than into a middleman who will invest in startups on your behalf? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:27:29
I'm not saying the value is derived from not needing a middleman, I'm just saying that you can exchange with another person without one and without the need for trust. 
In fact I think I said obviously don't buy crypto if that's what you think. 
Not needing an exchange does make it significantly better in my OPINION. Not like the banking institutions whom we trust with the value of our wealth have a good track record or instill faith that they operate in your interest at all. In fact I would say the opposite seems evident. 
While today Bitcoin and crypto might be limited to speculation (I disagree, for instance it's great for sending money very quickly internationally without the week waiting to clear at a bank and then the massive exchange fees) the world is in dire need of systems that force participants to be honest. Not like we are an honest bunch to begin with. 
It's a fantasy to believe that's what is happening today but not necessarily that it might be possible in 10 years. Now I'm also guessing about the future value this tech may bring.
Btw I have both crypto and stocks, not trying to say one is better or worse just that they for sure both are based on a degree of speculation, crypto more so than stocks maybe.

I'm not pushing you to do anything, it's your choice to break the local laws and you can, should, and likely will be held accountable unless your dealing in negligible amounts. 
You do whatever you want, but it's odd to call people slaves for following the laws.  I'm just clarifying that regulations should be imposed on any financial transaction operated in a governments jurisdiction using that government’s currencies. It’s each individuals prerogative to follow those regulations. 
Good luck with your choices.

Yes? 
Do you not get it? I'm not contradicting myself if that is the implication. 
The point is that "lost" coins are not guaranteed to be lost forever because the legacy addresses they are stored on can be decrypted in time. Not all BTC address, BTC evolves with technology, old "lost" addresses.
Notice how your segwit addresses have fewer vulnerability than the legacy ones? I'm suggesting this progression will continue as BTC develops to a point where current address are perfectly safe but the old legacy addresses can be accessed eventually. 
I'm not saying this will harm BTC, just saying that it's wise to consider the total BTC supply as 21 million, not some aggregate less lost coins.

Most gambel sites operate outside the USA anyway and have no jurisdiction here. I feel you you just hit a jackpot and they are gonna have to swallow the loss which was their fault to begin with. I'd say it's entirely your progressive to be honest and give the money back but I wouldn't do it.

Beyond that though I have been buying back all week. I'm still very invested in Bitcoin and don't think the price is headed even close to 0. From where I'm sitting it looks like things are progressing nicely and there's a lot of interest from new money.

Not true, low volume makes for less stability. 
If the price is stable but the volume is low that means it only takes low quantity buy or sell pressure to move the price up or down. Low volume opens you up for high volitility.

@_date: 2018-07-24 18:52:46
Bitcoin and it's software are open source! This means that the code running your software (developed by other people) is 100% transparent and available to the end user.
That means the end user does not need to trust the developer who made the wallet or software, instead they are free to verify the source code for themselves and can determine it's ligitimacy and security first hand.
There is no trust needed, only an understanding of code which is open source and the tools you need to learn it are available online. Not to mention you can have people explain to you what you don't understand untill you do understand.
DONT TRUST, VERIFY!
@_date: 2018-07-16 07:48:22

The case would be that BTC network would update and users would migrate their coins to new addresses, like how your using segwit addresses now instead of legacy  ones.
When new updates come online that make addresses more secure against things like quantum and people migrate to those addresses, lost coins stay on legacy addresses and those become more vulnerable over time.

I think the problem is more rooted in the power which the wealthy have over there government and over access to the financial system. 
With USD I cannot invest in seed funding rounds or act as angle investor even though I have the funds, because I'm not an accredited investor. My access to the financial system is limited by a minority who has significantly more wealth than me. My access to the system is limited and by extension so is the influence I'm able to afford.
With a system like Bitcoin it does not matter who I am or how rich my friends and family are, I cannot be limited access, nor can I limit the access of others to the system. Regards of if I hold .001 or 100,000 BTC. This uncensored access to the system and the inability of the wealthy to destroy the wealth of the less wealthy is what gives bitcoin an edge over any existing system and is the reason that I personally hold a large portion of my wealth in crypto currency. 
Certainly there are much deeper problems with the American political system than just the monetary system funding it. But the only reasonably conceivable solution would have to be a system that is inherently trust less because that is the only way to remain provably uncensored and Unbiased.
I agree with you that the way forward is better education. Even a small fraction of the military budget shifted to education would accomplish this but it won’t happen because my pockets are not deep enough and I cannot afford enough influence to make this change happened and at the end of the day that’s how the change will happen, when the right people put the right amount of money into the right hands.

In 10 years you still think those legacy addresses will be as resistant as today. 
I'm not saying BTC will be brought down by quantum, I know it's resistant. But as the tech evolves, coins that don't move to updated addresses because they are lost will become more and more vulnerable.
If not quantum then something else maybe. I'm just saying don't consider lost coins as permanently burned, it's not impossible that they can be recovered.

Yeah and those people at the federal reserve tell the rest of the banks how much money they are allowed to create as part of fractional reserve lending, which is how money is created from nothing and it's store of value is destroyed over time. (Not much time ether, at the current inflation rate it's about 18 years to half the value of your money, by this I mean if you stick a$20 under your mattress And pull it out in 18 years to spend it, you'll be able to buy with it what $10 would have bought you when you first put it under that mattress 18 years back)
Fiat is also used to fund government elections and campaigns and almost always that money is funneled through super pacs who's contributers are anonymously enacting their interest on your elected representative. Because you cannot trace these funds in a reliable and trustless way, basically all elected officials are in the pocket of these "special interest" groups. Those interests are not often in line with yours but how can you know?
For example look at how much of the USA budget is used to fund the military industrial complex, and how many people actually agree that this is where the money should go. It's not majority rule it's all about money, Bitcoin and trustless money systems will at least give people the ability to hold their politicians accountable for accepting money from questionable sources.

Well that may be but that does not mean you have to use software that u don’t understand. The system is in fact trust-less, given a technical understanding. 
I think it’s not reasonable to say you have to use something you don’t understand and because you don’t understand it that means it requires trust. You have the option to learn and verify for yourself and just because you chose not to does not mean it requires trust.

I highly recommend using exchanges in your municipalities jurisdiction so you can take legal action in such a case.
I use Gemini because I'm in the USA and so are they and I'm ok with the 1% fees for the peace of mind that there is some legal action I can take in the event of fraudulent action on the exchanges part. 
I would recommend using large more well established exchanges if your thinking about trading with amounts of money you would feel uncomfortable loosing.

From what I am seeing watching the market and the order books you are leaving out one of the very obvious manipulation tactics that are clearly happening.
I'm not sure if you have noticed but there is definitely an individual or a group acting as a single entity manipulating the price by wash trading. (They are buying their own sell orders and selling their own buy orders to drive up the appearance of trade volume and manipulate the entire market price)
It's very obvious that this is happening on bitfinex by a user who seems to have control of somewhere between 60 and 120 million USD worth of BTC and fiat that is regularly being wash traded to manipulate the entire crypto price.
Lately my suspected culprit is the people who run bitfinex themselves, or someone close with them. No one in thier right mind would trust such a sum of value with an unregulated, fly by night, establishment and still have such impunity when it comes to access to those order books.
Wash trading has been illigal in the USA since 2010

The thing your missing is GDAX 
Coinbase has an exchange section at GDAX.com where you can log in with the same credentials as your coinbase account. Once there you place a limit buy order where you specify the price you wanna pay. These orders have much lower fees and they let you set a price and walk away, the exchange will trigger the transaction when the market price lines up with your ask price.
Like in your example if the price shows 8800 then you could place a buy order for 8750 and it will just sit on the order book untill the price condition is met and your buy order triggers automatically.
What I like to do is set buy orders in increments all the way down. Like if it's 9000 now I'll set several 0.05BTC buy orders at 8900, 8800, 8700, 8600... All the way down to like 6500 then when the market moves I'll hit my buy orders all the way down, then when the market turns I start to sell incrementally starting at my average buy price from the previous buy run and increase the price per sale from there in the same way.

In Decred you may delegate your voting power to a voting pool so you do not need to keep any hardware running and you are compensated with more Decred just for participating in the voting process.

I'm fascinated with how simple it's gotten but from a perspective of starting years ago.
I would say it has gotten easy enough that I told my 55 year old dad about it and he got into some cryptos using the Exodus wallet. (I sent him a few so he didn't have to sign up at an exchange)
It has an interface that is very user friendly and handles all the complex stuff for your in an invisible way so it's much less intimateing and holds like 30 coins with a shapeshift exchange app built in. 
Back when I started in 2013 I would say you are right, it was to complex for the average Joe. And the price reflected that. Today I think there are so many user friendly ways to get into BTC it is now in the ball park of any average Joe.
Keep in mind most average Joe people won't have sums of BTC to get a hardware wallet for and many people are content holding through a third party like coinbase which is very simple and relatively safe if you yourself are not fully versed in the crypto security practices to be your own bank.

The thing is that at least a fixed supply can be agreed on and a backing by metals from the ground creates an artificial scarcity. The current system gives way too few people way too much power and impunity

No it's a consensus protocol and can be changed whenever you want, the thing is for a change to be implemented the majority (or at least a good amount) of miners and nodes need to switch over to the new protocol, if they don't the coin forks. One chain is new protocol and one is old.
So the challenge is getting a decentralized network of contributers to agree on upgrades and when to imminent them all without a central Authority giving the word.
Also why I like Decred because the holders have the ability to vote on network changes and protocols and miners cannot just fork the coin unless they have a majority support from the owners of the coins who are participating in voting, it attempts to solve the governance issue Bitcoin has been struggling with very publicly for the past almost 3 years

No they do have a bank widget on their site that lets you log in with your bank account credentials to Easley establish a connection between your bank and the exchange but you can create an account and fund it with traditional wire transfers as well, you don’t have to use that widget.

You got it backwards, buy now and if the price goes up sell if it goes down buy more to average down your purchases price

I have the same GPU the 1080TI 
I mine with nice hash on it and throttle the power consumption to 60%
I get about $2 - 3 a day with it or around 0.00025BTC 
By limiting the power consumption of the GPU to 60% the hash per wat makes this relatively profitable over the electricity cost.

I mined most of the BTC I spent on shit back in the day so if felt more like getting something for nothing than spending potentially millions.
I still buy shit with BTC regularly on purse.io

Capitol gains are not income. It does not matter what tax bracket your income tax is when it comes time to pay gains taxes, gains is basically 20% of profits if you soled in under 1 year or 15% of profits if you sold after holding for over 1 year. 
It's a bit more complex in practice but that's basically the gist.
In you example you should pay income tax on the 8k when you receive it for payment. If you then sell it for 8k you don't own any gains tax. If you sell it for more than 8k you owe gains on the profit and if you sell for less you can write off the loss in your taxes as well.
To be clear you pay income tax on money you earn and you pay gains tax on profits you realize when trading. Receiving payment in Crypto is taxed as income at the USD exchange rate at the time of the payment. Then gains taxes are applicable if you sell the crypto for USD at a profit over the valuation you already payed income tax on.

Other coins seem to be faster and cheaper because no one is really using the network. Now a days Bitcoin is fast and cheap too because of low transaction volume, the difference is the network size and security.
I personally really like Decred and keep a third of all my coins in DCR because I like it's Fundamentals better.

My understanding is you owe income tax at the price of the split, then you owe gains on it if you sell for profit over the price you payed income tax on. 
Might be way off but that was my take

I'm an expert, let me tell you about Bitcoin shares
@_date: 2019-05-02 23:17:00
I like the rounds better than the bars in one oz form. 
Not only are they ligit pirate treasure coins, they are denominated with currency value so you can take them across boarders without claiming it. 
That bar has an import value of $1,300 but my one oz coin from Europe is only worth €100 as far as customs is concerned. The one oz USA golden eagle is $100 you could take like 20 of them across the boarder and legally not need to declare. it it was bulion you would have to declare 20oz
@_date: 2019-05-07 08:44:01
Yeah for sure it's suspicious to carry $25,000 worth of gold in general. But you don't need to declare $2,000 of us currency.
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:44:42
Yeah and you'll also be asked for at least a 25% premium in my experience.
It's not cheap to keep your identity verification out of the picture and it will always cost you at least a 15% premium.

I have bought gold with Bitcoin before. But physical gold, none of those derivatives.
I'm interested in doing so again and maybe online next time, first time was in person.
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:32:06
Yeah its been relatively under the radar. 
I Neve like buying gold online though, I like to see it in person and witness the authenticity testing first hand. I'm too paranoid.
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:27:53
Wow nice catch
@_date: 2019-05-02 23:32:13
gold rounds are denominated in currency for this purpose. 
I have personally brought gold across the boarder several times and was reassured by customs that I did not need to declare my currency if it was under 8k or some threshold, and gold rounds issued by a governments mint and denominated in that currency count as currency. 
Bars would not count as currency but mint rounds do.
Like if you brought 100 silver eagles with you, they are worth $100 because of their denomination not the value of their silver content. Actually worth like $1,500 in raw material. Same goes for gold.

Bitcoin is legitimate, Bitfinex is not. 
The risk in arbitrage is with Bitfinex not Bitcoin

I agree with your long term concerns and I really like the way Decred handles consensus so that there cannot be forks. Also I prefer a store of value where as a holder of the tokens I have input on the consensus rules.
Imagine having a million USD worth of BTC and then some miners or "core devs" decide to implement a protocol change that you are not in support of. As a BTC holder you have basically no say at all, it's up to nodes hosts and miners to agree on consensus rules and when they don't the network fractures (BTC, BCH, BTG, BTPV, BTSV...)
Long term I'm very excited to see how Decred holds up.

Those gold rounds (gold eagles) are one Oz and denominated as $100 by the USA mint so you can take them across-the-board without declaring them unless the currency denominated value exceeds the threashhold.
