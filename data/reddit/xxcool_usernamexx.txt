I always liked the meme where the caption goes something like "but I can't snort cocaine with bitcoin"

i dont know about you, but even if i had that kind of money...i still wouldn't be sending 40 stacks in one go to a fucking crypto exchange after seeing everything that's happened over the years

I got in at 0.9 see how easy it is to lie on the internet?

It's more it's own class of asset now, it's not changing the current money system...just another thing people can own and exchange for other things, but far from being a currency or commodity. Even the CEO of coinbase has said this.

And you wonder why they don't take it seriously
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:03:23

I'm not saying the guy's an Eisenstein level genius, but I'm pretty sure he knows more about this than you, I and the majority of people out there, so yeah, if the CEO of the largest US-based company that makes money off of bitcoin (and other crypto) transactions says something, I'd wager it carries some weight, as there's no reason for it NOT to. Believing otherwise is indicative of having your head somewhere else...the clouds, your ass, under ground...you pick. I mean the sheer principle that many bitcoin hodlers treat the asset like a meme machine and essentially have turned it into a running playground joke says a lot more than a guy who seriously comments on the status of it's future. But that's just like...my opinion man.

no matter what you idiots think. the wealthy will always stay wealthy. fuck this wage gap experiment decentralized nonsense. once billionaires and financial institutions figured out how to game the system and make money off of the asset you all lost all credibility you had it would break society free of the clutches of their power. it's over. pack up your bags and go home. they've had, and will always have a way to dangle the carrot in front of you guys.

when people start viewing it as a currency and not a way to "git rich quick im le meme wizard heh" it'll happen. till then keep shooting yourselves in the foot.

This is akin to saying we owe it to kids who like Lil pump or Post Malone because they talks about "poppin pills and fucking bitches" as if that makes what they talk about legitimate. Kids literally know jack shit about the world around them. That's why the majority of liberal teens turn into conservatives in their 30s and 40s. They came around to how stupid they were as a youngster. You don't see many middle age men or women running around in Jncos or Spencer's attire do you? There's a reason they say youth is wasted on the young. 
What a shit argument.

I remember before the dip sending $3 had almost $20 in fees on coinbase. That's insane. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:39:59
that's why i shuck and jive
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:45:42
My point was that because it lacks intrinsic value it's not defined by certain constraints. Of course this also means risking losing a lot of money but on the other end of it...well, if i'm not mistaken it was $20,000 2 months ago and people still say it can go to multiple hundreds of thousands, with articles coming calling it the new gold, etc etc.   
  
I'm not saying I agree with these people...I've said for a long time that there is no real value to Bitcoin...but I'm not going to fool myself into thinking money can't still be made off of it.

faster tx times and cheaper tx fees are two reasons i can think of off the top of my head
