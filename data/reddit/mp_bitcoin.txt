Some of the comments in here are hilarious. I'll say up front that I am a believer in Bitcoin over the long term. But there is no way that it is "10/10" in it's current state. CC is very fast and easy and protected. I've had two cards compromised and in both cases had it resolved within a few days. Not to mention cash back. We (the community) need to focus on ease of use for mainstream adoption and not get deluded into thinking that the bitcoin ecosystem is even close to where it needs to be.

I encountered a cafe here in Vancouver that ripped down all their bitcoin signs. I asked why and they said that they still accept it but prefer not to transact with it because its slow
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:57:13
i don't understand what this is supposed to mean. being in IT, my technical papers are significantly different than casual emails or messages. not to mention emails from a smartphone.

I tried shopping at Overstock a year or two back and was disappointed that, as a Canadian, i could not purchase on their US website (as virtually every other retailer allows). Instead they force you to their .ca version of the site which of course had very inflated pricing. But since bitcoin doesn't require a billing address, hopefully I can give them my business now

you might have an easier time using CGwatcher in conjunction with CGminer
@_date: 2014-01-24 05:05:52
It's not recognizing your card. I had the same issue, try a different driver and play around with the cgminer config. You should see this middle section with GPU details.

Might collapse. Might grow. There are just as many arguments to be made on both sides. Only invest with what you can afford to lose and so on 
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:17:06
Nobody knows where its going. Period. However, if you BELIEVE in the future of btc, buy some.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:03:35
No one knows what the value will be at any point in the future. Spend what you can afford to lose and get in as soon as possible. And of course, do not panic sell if there is a dip! 
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:10:05
Yeah I calculated this the other day and honestly think its fair. As stated already, it costs money to run the thing. In the end, convenience costs money and thus far the gains in btc far outweigh the commissions of the machine. I would prefer to go this route than to rely on cashing out at some foreign exchange that would really suffer no consequences if they decided to rip you off. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:22:25
It's too early for a merchant like this. The big retailers will sign on when the btc market has stabilized and the smaller businesses have worked out all the kinks in accepting it as a payment

I've been an iPhone user since the 4 and an iOS user since the 2nd iPod touch. I'm currently using an iPhone 5. About a month ago I was in the market for my first tablet and went with the 2nd gen Nexus 7 and wow i love it. So much more freedom in the OS. I'm dumping my iPhone asap in favour of a Nexus 5 once I'm able to scrape some more funds together. I'm using Blockchain and Electrum for my wallets, as well as Bitcoinium widgets for monitoring price

Vancouver also has a physical exchange, give these guys a shout 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:39:46
No one knows. Anyone that claims to is lying. Do your research on how bitcoin works and how it is being used and make a decision on if you believe in it's future or not. If you do, buy now regardless of price.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:04:17
As long as you understand how to receive the btc properly you can't really go wrong. Craigslist is just a private agreement between you and a seller so you can use any payment medium that you both agree on. For EBay though, they don't support btc so you won't be able to transact through their website
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:24:23
Like it or not, the US is part of the world and contains a lot of people. I know a lot of you like to talk tough like the US doesn't matter but it does. Can it single-handedly take down bitcoin? No. Would becoming a 'pro-bitcoin' country help our cause? Absolutely. I'm well aware of how fucked up the US is right now but to act like they have no relevance on the world stage is just silly. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:47:29
Shoot me a message if you want to panic sell! I'd be glad to get some cheap coins
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:54:13
Interesting. I think the Bitcoiniacs guys said they already own 4 more ATMs and are planning to roll them out across Canada, hopefully theres no overlap with yours
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:28:22
Transaction fees probably?
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:29:41
You don't know that. If you believe in btc then buy regardless of price.
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:49:41
Congrats on the purchase! If you're investing in bitcoin's future, don't try to time the market. Just continually invest an amount you're comfortable with and stack those BTC over time. If you want to try and make a few quick bucks daytrading, do your thing and good luck 
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:27:23
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:00:08
Don't wait. If you believe in bitcoin's future, invest now and don't spend any more than you can afford to lose. I keep seeing people waiting for a crash but we very well may never see $500 again. What if it 'crashes' to $650? are you still going to wait?

That's not really true. I've stopped in there quite a few times and it's usually not in use or has 1-3 people waiting. And that 1-3 person line is caused by the current user taking forever by instagram-ing their experience or not knowing what they're doing (which I've helped quite a few people for in the latter). 
Not trying to be a downer on the ATM, just posting my experience. $100k is definitely a great number for the first week but I'm interested to see the weeks to come.

Being a former IT employee that dealt with financial and retail systems of another large chain, I can tell you that a change like this would be AT LEAST a year (most likely 2+) away from even being piloted at a few locations. Best Buy will probably go under before they could implement it. It is probably more effective to save your breath for smaller companies. The large ones will follow when the real-world demand increases and they can see that it works
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:51:16
Congrats! It definitely is fun to have any stake in it, lots of movement in the market. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:11:29
Seconded. But yes it will happen. What I'd really like to do is buy the new WRX in btc!
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:30:55
Don't get me wrong, I would like everyone to be into it. But some people, no matter how much logic or how many facts you throw at them, just need to accept something like this in their own time. I know people that still think it's some kind of scam or scheme, despite the fact that we live in the same city as the ATM and multiple brick and mortar shops that accept it as payment. All I'm saying is that's why I won't be gifting any btc. I do hope it works out on your end though
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:36:35
My two favorite subs coming together!
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:44:56
Just invest whatever you can afford to lose. There is no right or wrong time since no one can predict the market. Buy now, ignore day to day fluctuations and hold for the long term
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:20:19
As someone also from Vancouver... So what? The novelty factor has come and gone, now we just need to get as many of these things out into the world as possible!
@_date: 2013-11-02 03:17:57
Thanks for clarifying!
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:41:15
Their website has had warnings posted on it lately about high volume. The last time I used it, it told me before submitting payment that it may take a few hours to receive the btc. I went to sleep and the transfer was complete when I woke up. Maybe you just missed that part? Otherwise, just send them an email. They seem to be one of the more trustworthy sites at the moment

Congrats on the purchase! As a fellow petrol head, this would be my first purchase too. I'm hoping btc conveniently skyrockets when the next gen WRX goes on sale :) enjoy the new ride
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:05:33
Honestly, aside from day traders (who i assume are experienced enough not to take reddit advice), who really cares about short term? All this bubble talk is getting old. To all the newbies: invest in it if you believe in it regardless of price. Do not invest what you cant afford to lose. Do not panic sell in a dip. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:00:09
Well the benefit here unlike stock is you can buy partial amounts. Just invest whatever dollar amount you're comfortable with so you aren't missing out on the  action
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:28:20
I've had several iOS devices over the years with no complaints..that is until I bought a Nexus 7 tablet a month ago and experienced Android for the first time. So much more freedom and app availability. Simple things like being able to copy files on to the device, no dependance on shit like iTunes. There is a Nexus 5 in my future
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:38:57
Posted this in the other Best Buy thread, but to go from a customer suggestion to being implemented in a store is at the very least a 1-2 year project in a company that size. They'll probably go under before they start accepting btc. Save your breath for smaller companies, the bigger ones will follow when they see the benefits. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:55:47
I think btc would be a great gift for someone that was interested but not ready to buy on their own. I wouldn't push it on anyone that I haven't already built a rapport with. Imagine being gifted a piece of paper with 0.2 units of something you don't understand and don't know what to do with. Some people (in my experience) just aren't ready to accept it.
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:08:01
Really easy to use. The fact that it scans your palm print is a bit off putting at first glance but i decided it didn't really bother me. Other than that, you just tell it to create a paper wallet on the spot or scan in your QR code of an existing wallet then pop in your cash. I think my favorite part is that there's always a few bitcoin-ers hanging around and up for a chat. Makes it easy to meet people. The machine itself doesn't look particularly complicated so I wouldn't be surprised if some competitors to Robocoin came along
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:24:58
Depends on where you are as well. In Canada, as long as you're licensed and buying from a licensed retailer, you can purchase online and have it shipped to your door. Same as any online shopping
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:41:54
I don't think btc are hard to acquire but hard to deal with anything that may go wrong. If an exchange decides to 'lose' your bank transfer, there's no guarantee you're getting it back. If it weren't for being in Vancouver with the ATM, I probably wouldn't have even bought in yet. I hate bank to bank transfers to begin with, let alone bank to foreign-uninsured-possibly-operating-out-of-a-basement exchanges
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:08:49
We don't truly hit parity until the market caps hit parity. Still a ways to go!
