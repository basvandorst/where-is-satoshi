Ok so they raised all that money to basically replicate LibertyX?

Look man, just spend a few minutes thinking about the premise of this start up. Human ATMs sign up to advertise themselves as people carrying a lot of funds. Then they meet up with people in back alleyways to do exchanges. It's all supposedly a really good rate... better than Western Union right? So maybe the human ATM makes 2%. This is supposed to be great for small remittances on the order of $100, right? So you have human ATMs going out with tons of cash to make exchanges, all to make $2 per transaction. No fucking way.

Nope, Goldman has invested in a large chunk of Circle.

It's funny, some CEOs actually do research and get educated BEFORE they make company decisions.

Well... at least 1 good product launched today...

Awesome, Bitreserve's product is very slick.
Just curious if you knew anymore about where they would be offering the bank account functionality? Will it be all across the US? I thought it might be challenging for them to do this because of the money transmitter licenses required and the fact that they are offering something that looks like it should be CFTC regulated.

You idiot, just look through previous post history. He's been pretty reliable in his past posts about events going on at Bitpay

Haha fair point. Would be funny if Goldman ended up owning more successful Bitcoin companies than Barry Silbert

this is actually pretty easy to understand. there are laws that govern money transmission in the US. Circle is subject to those laws... can you figure out the rest?

What's going to happen with Coinbase as they get roundly flanked/obliterated on every business line they have? Fiat onramp/wallet (Circle), exchange (itBit, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Gemini), merchant processing (dead), micropayment (dead)?
