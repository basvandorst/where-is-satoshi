I see what you mean now. Yeah, it is quite a bit cheaper.

Self promotion is more up to the subreddit moderators as there are entire communities based on self promotion here (lots of subreddits are run by companies). You can report him to the admins if you feel he is breaking the rules. 
I'm no fan of the guy but I don't think he deserves a ban for that.

Without people like that bitcoin would have never gotten to where it is today.

quadrigacx is well respected but coinbase is the only one that allows credit cards.

I've bought 500 on coinbase and I still have a 250 limit per week. It says you have to wait 30 days starting after that first 500. You get a 250 per week limit during that 30 day period.
I'm Canadian so not sure if that makes a difference.

My last ER visit cost me $0 here in Canada. My last walk in clinic visit cost me $0 as well and I got in to see them within 20 minutes. I feel bad for my neighbours to the south who have to pay out of pocket.

Maybe if you need the money by Friday, but holding that for another day or two will see it swing back. That's how it's always gone.
Bitcoin is only really risky if you're a day trader. 
Edit: Yes putting everything you own into bitcoin is a bit of a risky move if you might need that in cash in an emergency, I didn't mean to imply that it isn't. It's just not an extremely risky investment like OP was implying.

I would hope so, that's worse than some payday loans.
