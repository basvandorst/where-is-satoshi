Try Paxful. You can buy from various vendors but it all depends on what vouchers and gift cards you have.
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:46:41
You can buy small amounts little by little.
That's what I did when I started out.
You can do that on some exchangers but I prefer Paxful.
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:46:56
If you're dissatisfied, just wait it out then GTFO.
That's what I did when coinbase pulled that stunt on me.
I waited for 6 days only to get an automated response.
I've ran back to dNet and Paxful after they restored my coins and the network became stable-ish.
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:27:58
I don't know about hodling but when I transfer some of my earnings from exchangers like Paxful, I use trezor.
Try hardware storage where you have your own private keys.

Whether he/she endorses it or not doesn't matter. He answered the OP's question.
You're the one out of topic here.
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:21:50
I'm okay with fees but when they responded after 6 days with an automated response despite me getting my account reduced to 0 coins, that was a big turnoff.
I've ran back towards other sites but mainly on Paxful.
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:52:56
Lots of my nigerian friends are into Bitcoin and they were the ones who recommended Paxful to me.
Instantly hooked.
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:50:54
It's never too late to buy bitcoins.
I've never paid attention to all those hoopla
when I bought my first Bitcoin at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:35:38
$50? Well, you can buy small parts of a bitcoin at Paxful and you can work your way up to a whole bitcoin. Yes it may take some time but personally, I think it's worth it.
People don't buy it for various reasons, what I encounter mostly are people not believing in it or is totally oblivious about it. Yay third world country.

@_date: 2017-09-06 21:09:32
Makes sense since It was my close nigerian friends who suggested Paxful to me.
Bitcoin and Cryptos are very popular there AFAIK.
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:26:36
I buy Bitcoins and trade on Paxful.
They have Escrow and 24/7 support &amp; Moderators as well.
They have guides on how to buy bitcoin as well:

They say It's okay but if they had Issues, they should contact CS, wait it out then GTFO.

Agreed. Which is why it so Important for us Crypto users to follow, be informed and support the advances that our trade has made

Hoo boy...Wait `til those new users get a load of awful CS that coinbase has.
Drove me out and onto other exchangers and marketplaces like Paxful.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:08:07
I second this one.
I store all my earnings from exchangers and Paxful onto
my trezor
@_date: 2017-09-06 18:46:44
Always store your bitcoins at a hardware wallet or anywhere that's not an online wallet or default website wallet and also I agree on the private keys.
That's what I do to prevent the gooberman from getting my earnings from trading at Paxful.

If you're dissatisfied, just wait it out some more then GTFO once they restore it.

You should lawyer up If they don't return it, if you think it's worth it.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:36:32
I started like that via Paxful and other exchanges. Best decision I've made so far.

I'd like to see how coinbase plans get around the current
security Issues, network Issues and coin loss with users.
Wait till you talk to their CS.
I don't appreciate that they responded after 6 days with an automated response.
But no worries, I've ran towards Paxful and other trusted sites.
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:49:42
If you're into buying and trading as well, try Paxful.

Don't get discouraged If it goes down.
I've been hodling my BTC earnings from Paxful
since the first day I bought BTC!
KEEP HODLING!!! :D
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:25:39
*ugh coinbase has one of the worst customer service. I even messaged their page and they just put me on "seen" status lol.
CS is essential for me because I'm a clutz. I'm glad at least Paxful responds to me in a timely manner.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:06:23
Seems shady.
Always check if there is 24/7 support
and/or if said platform supports Escrow
which respectable marketplaces like Paxful has.
I always think of that when I buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:02:06
Good for you but...
Not everyone is so almighty, well Informed and has nerves of steel such as you.
Second point: having a good CS ensures Company gets feedback and yeah coinbase, like most companies, needs feedback.
I'd never patronize any anti-consumer practice.
And to answer your question //Are the people complaining about CS not understand how crypto works? Is that the responsibility of coinbase?//
yes, it is their responsibility to educate their users on how their system works and how crypto operates towards their system.
Ever done system analysis and design? You will be required to submit a manual.

I used to buy Steam Cards/Codes via Paxful but I discovered Steam caters to Bitcoin payment.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:09:04
Another hogwash statement.
I've never paid attention to all those hoopla

@_date: 2017-09-01 13:13:31
AFAIK, I didn't have to give any address at Paxful nor did I have to surrender any kind of ID.
Though you might find some vendors will require you to do so but not Paxful themselves.
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:13:57
My nigerian friends use Paxful for buying Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:01:14
Trade somewhere else! Aside from countless Issues they've had, Coinbase is meddling scum. 
Better off trading in other places.
Personally, I got my BTC out of coinbase and went back to dNet, Paxful and other sites.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:01:45

I used to, slow customer service and some issues with their wallet.
Went to Paxful afterwards.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:35:18
You should never trust an online wallet, especially coinbase's wallet.
Transfer it to a personal wallet with private keys or better yet go green(paper wallet).
That's what I do with my coins when I buy from Paxful.
@_date: 2017-07-07 10:36:21
What I did this previous sale was sell my Bitcoins for steam gift cards on Paxful and load it up to my account.
Had sold my bitcoins for higher value and at the same time got lots of games!
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:34:29
Meh! Don't pay attention to the buzz it makes. Just Hodl!
When I bought my first BTC on Paxful, I just looked forward.

I hate verification and stuff.
There are lots of other sites that don't require that like Paxful, etc.
