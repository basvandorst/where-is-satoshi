Yes, downvote me more. So less people actually see the truth behind this.

If the german authorities get to know that simon paid out bitcoins worth of 4 million euros he is DONE. They will sue the fuck out of him. Also, everyone who sold bitcoins on your site is fucked. Good job, simon.
edit: to clarify WHY everyone with fiat is fucked when he pays out the BTC: he doesnt even know how much money he is going to pay because he didnt meet any regulations by the german authorities. they are going to punish him. and he is going to pay in fiat. and who got fiat on the bank accounts? his users. who is not effected? everyone with bitcoins. this is hilariously wrong.

I am also selling in forums. But no personal website.

I am selling in forums and on bitmit, I dont want a discussion about my goods but a discussion about the mentality of most bitcoin users. It seems like everyone is in for the big money.

Except that this is not the government fault, but the site admin. He is clearly a idiot. God, am I angry. I did not lost just 500eur, but (NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS; POLICE). Shit fuck.

Well, I live in germany. Filing a claim will not give me my money back, but slow down the process. If there is going to be any claims fulfilled, this would take up to 2 years. I hope they will solve it on their own.
