Never heard of the meme then. Excuse me then. Be aware that nothing will be ever critical for an network that thrives on financial opportunities against many currencies. That alone makes it already unstoppable and uncensorable. Because nobody could control your own device. That alone will attracts more people, because the world will be gradually more connected to the internet in the time (currently 16.4% - as known in 2016 - of world population is connected to internet).
In a low-time preference, Bitcoin is a screaming buy, because in the long term a new concept of market will arise.
Given that view, everything in a mid-range period (e.g. ∓ 4 years) is just a futile detail.

Thanks for your answer. But I'm not talking about mining. I'm talking about if the bitcoins must be spent, at least &gt;50% of all active nodes need to register it, instead the hashpower. 
The risk is that the government, for example, the US government, have enough money to buy many ASIC and pay the electrical bill, then they have more than 50% of the hashpower of the network. With voting with active node, they're not able to do that anymore.
