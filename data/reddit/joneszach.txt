Thank you for the kind words. BTCvert was created for this exact reason - SUPER simple conversion of BTC, without bullshit, popups, or lack of sufficient technology to make it good enough.

Thanks for the recommendation. That's something I'll look into adding.

Backend is all nodejs. Site is served from static files. index.html is generated when the node worker updates its prices (this helps keep it fast by only serving static files).
Frontend users connect to the backend via socket to keep the prices updated. It seems to work well. Polling sucks when you can push data via socket :)
There is lots of room for improvement, which will come when the time is right.

Both are in the works. Multi currency already works, technically, it's just that users don't have a way to change the currency currently.

Maybe it's a [Dorian]( I don't see the Satoshi appear, yo. [blockchain link](

And the reason the graph shows 0 is because blockchain's API is giving incorrect information since their downtime the other day.

It's not log scale now, but at least it starts at 0. Is that any better, or do you have specific information how to make it better? jquery flot doesn't make it immediately clear how to find the proper algorithm and I'm not Mr. Statistician ;)

I thought I would like btcReport but I ended up confused and disliking it. btcReport's UI is too confusing (see: not natural), it is buggy, the price converter is SUPER confusing and uses a custom number pad which introduces its own problems.
