Japan is opening up to BTC and South Korea is about to follow suit according to recent reports, won't this cause a rise in the BTC price? 
Accordingly, we also have shit going down in France and Germany that could negatively affect the price until they change tack like South Korea, right? This would suggest short-term instability until France and Germany sort things out with a long-term rise?

Financially responsible parents open savings accounts/trusts for their children before they are born and fill them with enough money to do something if the kid ends up being born retarded, gets hit after birth by a car and ends up a cripple or say needs to attend university or buy tools to start work as a tradesman but sure, a 1 year old has no possible use for a bitcoin. *shrugs*

No reason why you couldn't do it but the coins would be single use if not a scam, leaving you with a useless token no one wants after it's spent.

Africa has a over population problem compounded by corruption, not a food supply problem. No amount of BTC can save Africa, only Africans can save Africa, mate.

They claw back the money if the hire changes job, gets sick, dies or gets fired within 3 months. This is a scam to get you to do the work of a real HR company without the hourly rate that carries you between commission payment and the option to recover any money paid to you as a result of doing your job.

You get a 1-up when you get to 100 in SMB, I think the US gets a 1-down if you guys hit 0.

Idea. Buy 10 rupee coins for 1 rupee a piece from people who think they aren't real, bring them to a proper bank, have them converted to notes. You win.
