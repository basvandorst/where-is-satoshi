This is a strong post. He's so right! The reason why we have done so well in 2017 is because of the community! Its because of the constant education and wisdom that is being taught and transferred from the strong hands and early hodlers to the new comers. 
Lets not forget that together we we're able to influence the community to stay behind the open source development of core.  
Lets not forget that together we pushed the miners to implement segwit.
And lets not forget that with the strong will of the community we we're able to fight off the Segwit 2x HF that imposed a great risk to our vision of a more conservative approach, because we know how delicate this innovation is and we don't wanna fuck it up!
Guys! There are so many shills in this forum that will constantly post on every single post just "complaining" about the scaling and the fees BUT what they are really doing is just spreading FUD, trying to put doubt in your head!
DON'T FORGET that we are in this in the long run and that we want Bitcoin to scale safely and properly, with LIGHTNING AND SCHNORR!
HODL ON TO YOUR BTC!! YOU WANTED TO END THE YEAR AT 10K WELL GUESS WHAT ITS GONNA BE MORE THAN THAT! 
Yeah we we're in a bit of a bubble at 20K and we still are! It doesn't matter! We're all in this for the longterm! Don't listen to the other shit people have been saying! All these other shit coins are copy cats and are more centralized than Bitcoin will ever be! 
Don't try to trade and make a quick buck its all just whales pumping and dumping! Theyre pumping coins under 1$ because the world is filled with idiots thinking theyre getting a good price!
HODL HODL HODLLLLLLLL

Bitcoin is a nice experiment, a great idea that came along with a ground-breaking technology however the fundamentals are not stronger than centralized currencies. The bitcoin currency in itself is centralized since the majority of the coins are owned by whales who can manipulate the demand and supply at will, and regular people are constantly getting their coins stolen via 3rd party apps. 
To me bitcoin is a manipulated asset controlled by market makers with the sole purpose of tricking investors to buy high and sell low.
