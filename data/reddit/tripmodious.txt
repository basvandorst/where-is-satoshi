It works - you need to have at least two nodes though.  So make sure it is set up on two computers, and on each, do "addnode (address) add".  Then you can start mining.

"Shorting" means you are betting the price will decrease.H
ere is exactly how you short BitCoins.
First, you need a friend to lend you Bitcoins for a day/week/month (how ever long you want to ride out your "short for)
Once he lends you his bitcoins, you sell them all. Then when you have to return them, you buy them back.  If the price went down in this period, you made money. It's that simple.
Example: You want to short 100 bitcoins for 1 day.  
1) Borrow 100 bitcoins from a friend
2) Sell Bitcoins in the morning for $1000/btc.  You Now have $100,000
3) At the end of the day, bitcoin is down to $800/btc.  So you buy the 100 back for $80,000BTC.  
4)You are done! Your friend has his 100 btc back and you made $20,000 because the price fell.
The downside here though is the price goes UP, then you LOSE money when you have to buy back the bitcoins!
Feel free to tip me if you ever make money doing this!

Good to know. Sorry didn't know there was a scam associated with this.

There was a guy who posted about how he left a bitcoin paper wallet tip at a chinese restaurant and it didn't go so well - people need to stop pushing bitcoin on people who are trying to make a living. Maybe this particular guy was cool with it. But most people will not be. Bitcoin should only be given to people who explicitly accept it IMO.
