You kind of have it the other way round. It is pretty easy to change actually. While block size is much more troublesome with alternative clients having hard fail exceptions on blocks larger then 1MB and other compatibility issues. Not to mention other scaling/propagation issues...
This is how the subsidy is actually calculated
    consensus.nSubsidyHalvingInterval = 210000;
    int halvings = nHeight / consensusParams.nSubsidyHalvingInterval;
    CAmount nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
    // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.
    nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= halvings;

You are correct. Unfortunately too ahead of the common understandings of Bitcoin atm. 
This does tie hard too arguments for Determinism and Free will; A big part of the forkers are hard determinists ( It is like they are stuck in the 18th century and have no concepts of irreversibility, entropy or 2nd law of thermodynamics, chaos theory etc.
Thus they think Laplace's demon is a real thing

1) reddit is not a majority of bitcoin.
2) redditors have many accounts thus are brigading.  (sock puppetry)
3) you can buy aged reddit accounts to spam it. (check histories of a lot of the commenting accounts)
4) These are attacks on the ACTUAL bitcoin consensus. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:06:47

It is a typical Sybil attack. It has all the marks

@_date: 2015-08-16 06:57:29
I was under the impression that's why reddit uses moderators. 
No cost into upvoting/downvoting/creating accounts makes brigading/sockpuppetry/spamming efficient.
Thus you need moderators well... to moderate and keep the subreddits on topic and clean of spam. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:14:28
so.. you want me to appeal to authority?
the fact is 1MB is the HARD RULE of the ACTUAL BITCOIN  chain. 
That is the REAL consensus. 
Beliefs of any of the core developers or xt developers or altcoin developers, redditors matter nil.
Follow the rules or be gone. That's what bitcoin actually does.

No. We only accept bitcoin for deposits. Everything on the platform happens in bitcoin.
No chargebacks or other such non-sense.




See above.


Payouts are between 50%-&gt;65% based on quarterly performance. And are in bitcoin. Channel owners withdraw they're full account balance bitcoin on each withdrawal. And are executed periodically.
@_date: 2015-07-19 21:02:19
Xotika.tv uses only bitcoin for payouts (and altcoins with shapeshift for deposits). No chargebacks. No fraud. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 11:23:44
Kind of. The amount is not always swept unless needed or goes above certain thresholds. But yeah that's about it.
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:14:22
Nothing you said was true. Imagine that

Sure. We're looking for more Javascript/AngularJS developers for the frontend if you're interested send an email to contact[at]xotika.tv?subject=Front-End Developer and we'll definitely  check it out. Payments are in bitcoin of course
@_date: 2015-08-16 06:59:41
But it is not very clear. I have read the comments.
I see a lot of fallacies, bad predictions, no testing and appeal to authority. Am I supposed to be convinced?
This is a clear attack on the ACTUAL bitcoin.


Not really a  lot of people are being turned off by everything reddit and they simply do not care and find it unproductive to participate. Maybe they have work to do?
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:13:38
You should try it on chrome. The frontend app does a lot of rendering and css animations which tend to be taxing or poorly supported. We will have a mode to disable the animations or make the UI more 'light'. 
Current versions only have a heavy mode since we plan on using most of the features for animation in chat and other fun interactive stuff.
@_date: 2015-08-10 03:04:05
I for one am sick of all the yadda/yadda fork bitcoin bullshit.

Edit: Yes yes, a few outlets of bitcoin news. Luckily you get to spam/Sybil and game this one. Maybe its the case for XT to grow some pairs of their own. This 'outlet' has been abused long enough
@_date: 2015-07-17 13:55:56


The biggest issues facing Streamium are:
1) When you use streamium you have to fan out AV data to your viewers. 
Adding large requirements for bandwidth and processing power for each viewer involved.
2) Streamium exposes your IP address. Which for cam workers / bitcoin holders is dangerous and they risk all kinds of security attacks.
3) Lack of discover-ability
4) WebRTC vs RTMP - rtmp(Flash) is a lot more established. It already supports all kinds of hardware/software for Relaying/Streaming/Video Composition/ etc. Which people already use and are accustomed too.
Disclaimer: I am the developer of   - An streaming platform with voluntary bitcoin tipping.

@_date: 2015-07-20 08:21:57


Yep. Xotika.tv is a cam site with a tipping model. Not a bitcoin mixer. Only performers and channel owners that received tips can withdraw where it it supports instant bitcoin withdrawals.


Most of the selling point comes from not having any charge backs possible. It's stupid to introduce 0-conf just to replace them with double spends. Sorry


Your expectations... Are wrong.
@_date: 2015-07-27 23:45:40

@_date: 2015-07-27 19:27:26
For those reasons exactly we use a tipping based model where the customer tips what he wants and the splits start from 50%. If you think about it it's a really sweet deal for all sides.

The Ad itself 
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:04:31
This is a platform for bitcoin. You deposit btc, you tip btc and you withdraw btc.
Now about other cam sites, that attractiveness you talk about is pretty sour. It includes: Chargebacks and other fraud, Long Withdrawal times, Lots of barriers of entry. And much more.
As for justifying i'm sure you know there are server costs, bandwidth costs,  development costs, advertising cost and so much more. Not even to talking about that 50-&gt;65% splits are amazingly good compared to the other cam sites which are around 30% + any other hidden fees along the way.
And our features, which you'll see deployed step by step.

I've been programming for the last 18 years. And have a lot of experience with all kinds of languages.
I do most of my work nowadays in Java and C++.
Also a lot of working experience in Security/Unix/Embedded Systems /etc. 
Long history:p


No. I wrote a trade engine and a bitcoin exchange in 2013. Which failed late 2014. 


No problems really. 


Not much atm. I solved what I needed by hooking to a trusted node with the P2P protocol and getting the extra information I needed from there. I think bitcoin core is fine as is. Would probably need more work into turning it into more of a gateway to the Bitcoin network. But it's usable right now and most of the times it's a lot better then the Electronic Payment Systems software(or servers) you see in the FIAT world .
So that should say a lot
@_date: 2015-07-20 08:16:56


Xotika.tv doesn't split trafic/or pull video from other FIAT based sites. Each model that streams on xotika.tv uses xotika and bitcoin.
The site you mentioned doesn't even appear to have any video showing functionality and too see anything it is pay per view 6.25 mBTC/min.
To me that just look like a proxy, that is proxing between other FIAT websites and BTC. That's not what we're aiming here.


This is for performers since Xotika doesn't differentiate Steamer vs User accounts. And any user can create a channel and start streaming. Initially it was optional and a lot of models forgot to add one which  made it hard to prove who they were for support which caused problems. It doesn't send any non-solicited mail. So you can just input a fake email and it will be fine.


No. Persons under 18-year old or that do not complete the ADULT requirement. Have nothing to do on Xotika.TV .
@_date: 2015-07-27 10:12:16


We do use some open source components which we contribute to. But the platform at hand is not opensource.
We do plan on externalizing API calls and creating API tokens for developers to extend the functionality but that we'll come later.


We use straight up bitcoin transactions for deposits. Payment channels do not really fit the model well.
You deposit as much as you wish, through normal bitcoin transactions and they will be imediatly available for spending in mBTC format after 1 confirmation
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:13:17
Sorry not right now.  But I will prepare a report with the data and post it. Maybe by the end of the week.
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:55:53
Thanks for the kind words!


I don't mind it's not a secret :P
The the frontend is just a thin client written in Javascript/Angular that contacts a backend server and starts working and rendering.
The Xotika.TV backend is written in written in Java. 
As for a database I use Hibernate EntityManager and PostgreSQL together with [Infinispan]( distributed cache. 
Every read is delivered from the cache while writes invalidate the previous data. Thus you get very low latency and high concurrency pretty easy.
Integration with  transaction manager and  for scaling/clustering, is planned for the future. But not really needed right now
As for hosting, I'm a fan of using my own hardware and dedicated servers. I'm ready for automatic scaling but it will just be video or other data that CDN's can handle. I wouldn't trust virtualized solutions with private keys or private user data. Since they can always mess with the runtime and get you owned. 
For bitcoin you can keep it a bit more secure in virtualized environments by using BIP32 PubKeys. So at least you don't have to worry about the private keys. But still they can mess with the runtime pretty easy.


I try to stay away from NodeJS/NPM &amp; co. It's a compatibility nightmare and lacks a lot of the fine-grained locking you need.


We use Bitcoin Core as a gateway to the bitcoin network. And making sure our incoming data is fully validated.  But handle the transaction signing 
Phew.. i've rambled
@_date: 2016-02-02 17:11:32
The platform has html5 support since January. The warning is a bit dated and will probably get edited soon. 
We still have support for flash for delivering low latency video. But now it's switchable.

@_date: 2015-07-27 10:40:58
Mostly because xotika deposits are one way. You deposit and then have it available for immediate spending.
And to carry all this we wrote our own systems to provide addresses and routing for each transaction.
We also don't issue change or refunds per deposits. And all the withdrawals are issued only for the full sum. So there isn't really much need for it
@_date: 2016-02-02 17:09:33
I'd like to address a few points that hopefully will answer your questions:
* All XOtika.tv channels are PUBLIC; And tip based; viewers can report channels which is linked to a active-response filter which will react to reports.
* No underage persons are allowed on xotika. Featured in streams or displayed. 
* Most performers can prove they are of age especially if they used other sites before which do require ID's
* A lot of the channels on xotika.tv are actually verified. 
* Publishers are liable for what they publish.
* XOtika operates lawfully
Peer-To-Peer video is a problem at the moment, expenses for publisher will be big, especially for a lot of viewers. Attacks are also common and security for industry performers extremly low.
@_date: 2016-02-02 18:10:11
The amount was 8.8 btc. Which is the largest single tip ever received on xotika.
When depositing on xotika 1 btc turns into 1000 mBTC. 
The minimum tip amount is 1 mBTC

Hey. At the moment we're using recaptcha to stop a lot of the web bots from moving forward. It's required only one time for receiving an entry token. For Otika.TV it might be removed in the future.
We'll be revamping the Tip button in the future versions into something less annoying and more intuitive.
It only flashes red when no credits are available or low. It goes from green / yellow / red .

You should ask the streamium developers that one.


There is no point to host it there is no connectivity between 'peer servers'. Peer servers are central servers that broker your connections to the streamer.
Or simpler: There is no streamium network.


They are nothing like bitcoin nodes.

You sir are deeply confused and have no idea what you're talking about.
Sorry but I can't use the "Streamium Technology" as a backbone or ANYTHING. Because Streamium is just a HTML Web App with WebRTC 
Streamium is just an Angular HTML app with WebRTC for direct peer-to-peer video delivery and payment channels. It is no way any kind of technology not even a decentralized one.
As for the vote manipulation and other bullshit accusations. It's just figures of your imagination. If you want to see reddit shilling search for streamium.
I mean really I read your post and tried to undertand it; But it just sounds like you've been smoking Streamium :o
@_date: 2015-10-01 12:33:43
I will add that streamium isn't even decentralized. It uses a CENTRALIZED server to do all the peer exchange. And after that it goes to PTP mode with a direct WebRTC connection.
The centralized streamium server is hosted by eordano.com which one of it's developers.
 is the backend for it.
So truly I there is no reason to use any part of it. Unless I want to severely gimp XOTika.tv services.
Hope you wake up and check yo shit.
