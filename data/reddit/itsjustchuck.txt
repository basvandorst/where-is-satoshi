Why does everyone want ripple? Because it's going up? To me it's the bankers crypto. Just look at the board. So sad to see so many people who hate central banks share their same greed.

Or bring value to the table.

I've been following btc since 2012 I didn't miss anything.

I am in it. And not just to win it. Not only do I hold btc but mine it as well. I've chosen not to deal with corrupt coins like Bitcoin cash and ripple. If you want to that's fine just don't cry about corrupt bankers while eating from their hand is all I'm saying. Try being a part of it rather than someone on the sidelines waiting to hop over to whatever side is "winning".

 $0.05/kwh but this summer I'm trying to have my solar/wind setup complete that will give me 3kw hopefully. I've considering 2 S9's but figured if this is a good price then I could test it out first before I drop the cash for 2 S9s

the guy said he got them awhile ago and never figured out how to power them,guessing he doesn't have a power supply.

I've been but I don't know what I'm looking at. They look like 2 s7's and the left on is Spondooliestech sp20. If they are s7's then it would be enough to play with and learn more about mining I suppose, just looking for another opinion.

Awesome thanks for the breakdown! I didn't buy this and doubt I will and just get the 2 S9s like I've been considering so far
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:54:21
No worries thanks again!

I would think this isn't so good. I mean taxes are out of hand. We need to abolish the Federal reserve and make blockchains to replace govts and utilities I would think but never had to care for billions of people before

Sick designs! I could see bitaddress just offering different designs and this could be one of them? I'm building a site thats geocaching for bitcoin paper wallets so I'm interested in anything regarding paper wallets.
if anyone wants to share feedback for my project, love honest criticism. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:03:24
That's awesome thanks! I'll add that as an option under bitaddress.org!

Also why didn't they ever allow players to battle in Pokemon go. Feel that would've made it better

It would be a payment technically. The user can select the % of the amount that goes to either them or another wallet that the person paying has a chance to find. Does that make sense?

Thank you very much for the comment! And that is a great point as when I tried this at my home when they found the pvc pipe with the paper wallet it was wet, but I had a copy just in case of that. Should've done a ziploc haha
I figured a card with (soap+paint) to make a scratch off of the private key, just in case someone tried to snap a pic. Your idea has given me another idea! I'll create some different tips when people create a quest on suggestions on storing it or links to bitadress.org etc. Thanks again!

Eth? Been practicing smart contracts. Thought it would be cool if it made trading cards instead of tokens. Card could be generated from address and some logic. Each wallet is a card basically. Tokens in it  could level up the cards or something. Random stoner thoughts

I love the idea and want it to go there eventually. I figured I'd start with a simple site that can add steps/clues or order a dish for a clue. Just to get it off the ground while I learn how to code the game. But want to allow both a physical quest and a digital one where you don't have to be there or maybe you do but don't have to interact with physical objects

Thanks! Any suggestions? I saw a few Reddit posts hiding some and found a couple games like bitrunner.io and spells of genesis though they're all still concept but way farther than me. Ideally bitquests would be a mix of all of it. How cool would it be to climb a mountain, unlock a riddle and get some legendary sword in world of Warcraft?
