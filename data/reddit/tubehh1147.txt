I would definitely be worried about short term volatility.  Cryto currency is not like the stock market where in the long run it has always increased.  Well, it could be but, I dont think anyone actually knows as cypto currency has no existed before in history.  For all we know it could just die within 1 month or 50 years. 
Edit: It is sad that people are actually downvoting my comment.  Must just be mad that they are losing money on their bitcoins.

Fiat money is backed by the government.  The government does not create money when ever it wants because there is something called inflation.   Please explain to me how bitcoin can be backed by math, I honest to god have no clue what you are talking about.  Bitcoin has gotten its price from people creating a huge demand/buying into it thinking its going to exponentially rise and make them millionaires.  It looks to me like its backed by nothing and has a hugely artificial raised price. Seems like a bubble.

Sorry but how is the quality of life in the US on par with a 2nd world country?  Are you stupid? Have you actually been to a 2nd world country before and seen the quality of life?

haha well said.

My college econ professor says bitcoins are in a bubble also.   We will see soon enough.

Lol, damn dude you got me.  Nice of you to add to the discussion by attacking my character instead of the topic at debate.

Very funny.  I know im in a pro bitcoin subreddit, but the normal economy is bound to go into a recession in the upcoming year or so, bitcoin will no doubt go down with it.   Its already going down as we speak.

What reasoning do you have that bitcoin is unkillable?  It is literally fiat money except its not backed by anything.  If anything its just a huge gamble right now, no different than scratch off cards.  No one knows what the crypto market is going to do.  
People also said the housing market is unkillable.

Nice argument you got there.  Ill just be laughing my ass off when it crashes again.

I think there is a lot of bias in your statements.  The US is a great place to live.  Obviously there are going to be homeless people out there and drug addicts and the mix.   Every country has these type of people.    If you actually think America is a 2nd world country I just dont know what to say to that.  You are cherry picking the worst out of the worst in a country and basing that on classifying a country.  That is a joke.  Take a look at the average GDP per capita and compare that to any 2nd world country.    
I have also traveled the world and been to every continent but Antarctica &amp; Australia.  I have been to 2nd world countries and even the capitals in those countries make you feel scared to just walk around.  
You just have an insane bias of the US and cant seem to look past that.   Also, I have never had a problem with the water in the US, &amp; you are have a stupid amount of confirmation bias about commenting on food safety.  Gimme a break dude, if you have actually been to a 2nd world country you would realize how shitty they actually are.  Most people in those countries live in fucking tiny shacks compared to the US where the average person has a house.

You would likely end up paying more taxes on your bitcoins in any of the countries that you listed as I'm pretty sure the personal income tax in those countries are alot higher than the US.

I feel like these predictions by "experts" are people just saying that to try to artificially raise the price. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:25:25
For sure it might be around, im just saying that it could easily crash.  Seems like its in a bubble right now.

Yes i am aware how banks work.  I have taken multiple economic classes before?  The government of the most powerful country in the world is not going to fail.  I trust the government a hell of a lot more than I trust a random crypto currency  that has super inflated prices.
