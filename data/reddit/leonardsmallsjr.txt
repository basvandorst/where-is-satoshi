800%...is that significant for bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:48:03
Well this was a nice and happy post. You have a wonderful day too!

Stock price is the present value of future dividends. BTC price Incorporated the present value of future energy/mining costs.

It looks like he's falling backwards.
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:15:50
Thanks! How does that work? There's a new account made for that transaction? I'd love to pay that forward in the future :)

Do we need a dominant currency? I would think yes as a common comparison for international trade. So, assuming yes, what could be the replacement? Euro? Bitcoin? Yuan? Two of those had me involuntarily saying "no fucking way".

Sat is like cent (lowest denomination)
Bit is like dollar
Coin is a million bits
Right now, one coin is $6000.
Or, right now 1 bit is $.006 ($1 is 167 bits).
Getting close to where it's easier to talk about bits than coins.

Can we just copy and paste bitcoin cash?

Alice creates the secret key, then when she gets the ETH, releases the key. What's to stop her from immediately going back and unlocking her BTC before the other guy?
@_date: 2018-10-11 22:54:58
Sounds like Tesla. And Facebook. And iRobot. Basically tech stocks.
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:19:18
Thank you. No arbitrage.
@_date: 2019-11-14 19:27:57
This makes a lot of sense. Thanks for following up!

This looks like a story about the Russian mafia with very little to do with cryptos. If Russians were laundering money using beanie babies or other collectibles, would they call this "Beanie Babies"?

What happens if someone in the US has money on that exchange? I noticed I can't see my iota on my app just now and assumed it was just an app bug.
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:51:23
Oh, is that all? So I hodl my IOT then a few years from now I can just pull out BTC? That's no problem!
I was concerned I wouldn't even be able to use the exchange to access my IOT at all.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:03:11
This also works for BTG?
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:08:27
Bitcoin appreciation is taxable
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:35:43
Assuming that argument has to do with fiat having inflation protection?
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:44:35
If I have one BTC on Jaxx, I'll have 1BTC and 1B2X. Can I send my BTC to a trezor to protect against replay and then send my B2X to an exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:13:24
[This]( what you're looking for?
@_date: 2019-02-13 16:28:08
Gotcha. Post-tax contributions. Agreed, and good thought for a "moon" investment!
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:03:21
If you don't mind, tell us more?

I used shapeshift via jaxx chrome extension in ios. Size was limited, so I had to have two transactions: one at .0018 and one at .0036. No idea why the difference. No issues for me. Kind of wish there was an issue or two so I'd be selling now instead of earlier today, but ah well. Can't time the market!
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:28:26
As a new trezor owner, may I ask why?
@_date: 2019-12-06 02:00:06
Long = hodl. Assuming you mean long call option? You'll need an exchange.

A few observations: 
 - XRP now leads 
 - XMR hasn't caught on with the criminal underworld like I thought it would. Or there are fewer criminals than I thought.
Edit for clarity: not shilling any coin. My observations are surprises I found from the link above that show XRP highest very recently. Anyone have thoughts on why?
@_date: 2019-12-25 03:38:24
Since I had to look it up. Others might find this useful.
Hash rate denominations
1 kH/s is 1,000 (one thousand) hashes per second  
1 MH/s is 1,000,000 (one million) hashes per second.  
1 GH/s is 1,000,000,000 (one billion) hashes per second.  
1 (tera) TH/s is 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion) hashes per second.  
1 (peta) PH/s is 1,000,000,000,000,000 (one quadrillion) hashes per second.  
1 (exa) EH/s is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (one quintillion) hashes per second.  
1 (zetta) ZH/s is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (one sextillion) hashes per second.

Rule of thumb: whenever an article title is in the form of a question, the answer is "no".
That said, I think when paying with crypto is as easy as PayPal, we'll see another big upswing.
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:53:27
Nitpicking or not, this was very helpful. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:17:37
Ianal, but wouldn't anything be taxable at the moment you trade for dollars?
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:00:20
I've always just considered:
1 sat
100 sats = 1 bit
1000 bits = 1 kilobit (kb)
1000 kb = 1 coin
Don't really care how it shakes out, but I agree that usable amounts should be easy to say and write.
@_date: 2019-09-10 23:42:09
So there's an ATM nearby charging 19%?
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:10:16
First time I've heard of this one. Looks like a nice exchange, but not a wallet and no control over keys?
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:06:50
Jaxx hasn't done shit either. But back in August they said "two weeks", so I have hope it'll be soon!
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:01:46
If I want to sell BCH now, do I need to simultaneously move my BTC to another address to avoid the risk of someone using that info to grab my BTC?
If it sounds like I'm new at this and smoking the methcrack, it's because I'm smoking methcrack.

250btc?!? I'll sell mine for 100!
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:59:44
A little off-topic, but it's interesting that his point about "when everyone has a voice no one will listen" is pretty accurate looking at the effect Twitter and Facebook have had on news.
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:27:26
And thank you for doing so.
@_date: 2018-07-21 18:36:48
26 panels, so something like 9Kw?  Unless there's a big part of the house not in the picture, that seems like a lot.  Wait, you mine BTC don't you.  Okay, now the math adds up.
@_date: 2019-09-01 21:57:06
The graph looks like one big parabola pointed down. I believe in Bitcoin and am a hodler, but this tea leaf reading is crap.
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:00:17
Personally, I think this is an awesome teaching idea. I'm going to go through this completely to help fully understand the process of what's happening behind the scenes.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:19:23
Thoughts on Jaxx, which he mentioned?
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:41:57
Recommendation? I do think it's time to be less lazy and figure out my paper wallet. 
@_date: 2016-05-12 14:27:52
Can someone knowledgeable follow up on this? I have a few coins there and all seems good and easy. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:19:32
On this topic, if you don't mind, where does Jaxx and other wallets get their money? Do they take a piece of the mining fee?
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:27:07
Also noob. Went to Jaxx. There's talk off security issue but appears to be nothing.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:05:27
If you're reporting taxes honestly, then go through an exchange for cheaper fees. To my knowledge, all exchanges require a bank account connection  (happy to be corrected if wrong). If you want to keep complete anonymity to avoid the tax man, atm sounds reasonable.

I own a billion bitcoin dollars!
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:40:43
Ban ether too! 
@_date: 2019-05-15 04:27:37
I have a Trezor. Super easy to transfer to Coinbase or whatever I want. Also, and I don't know if this really does any good or not, but when I'm sending decent chunks of coin, I send a few sats as a test to make sure I have the right address and am not doing anything stupid. Then send the rest.
@_date: 2019-05-09 16:04:30
In this case, can't &gt;!Thanos and Iron Man!&lt; get along since they serve different purposes?
Edit: just making sure the spoiler tag worked
