Bitcoin has become politicized
Not only is Bitcoin irrevocably flawed, but its community now also stands for what I detest. Censorship for instance. You can bet that this post will soon be [removed] by mods. And none of you will stand up to it. You are complicit because it suits your own vested interests.
The community has forced Bitcoin into an 'us vs. them' situation. You can see this when Andreas proclaims 'the banks are afraid of us' and such, or when people here accuse bearish posters of being paid to post 'FUD'.
I am now not only merely dismissive of Bitcoin, I am against it.
Since I'm also a long-term silver investor, I'll give you a comparison I'm familiar with: Ill never buy a round or bar with Jesus on it, or 'In god we trust' or something like that. Not only because I strongly personally disagree with it and refuse to support it, but also because it alienates potential buyers. A certain proportion of the population's support/interest has just been lost completely.
Bitcoin requires confidence in it if it is to succeed. It needs support; it needs not only to convince people of its feasibility, but also that it is something worth supporting.
Looking at the community of this subreddit, which is heavily biased/censored and full of greedy noob speculators and shills - who outside wants to support it?
Do you know why people are so quick to laugh at it when it crashes? Its not because they 'hate Bitcoin'; its because they hate the community.
Saying 'they'll come in due time' or such is extremely foolish - you have jeopardized the confidence and support of Bitcoin that you desperately need to happen - it cannot succeed alone on its own technical merits (that is, if it has any such 'merits')
