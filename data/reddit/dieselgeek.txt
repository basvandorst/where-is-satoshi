I don't know what that is, but he sure is angry. 
I've used tannerite quite bit, wish so hard I could have got some for today. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:16:11
Thanks man, he sent me a screenshot of the phone. Hoping it comes though. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:14:08
Done !!!   I just need to get home edit and upload
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:00:19
It is, at the end of the video, I describe the rifle. 
It's a custom built gun by  
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:59:22
OP said it was cool that I used my iPhone 4s because I was going to shoot the crap out of it. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:38:56
Dude, is this you're "attack" method?  OH LOOK AT YOUR KARMA, PUSSY FGT VIRGIN BTICH I'D OWN YOU. 
 So Alpha bro. Did you even watch the video? Or any of my videos?  You'd get a good look at my neck beard and MLP shirts... Or the whole reason why I have a large amount of this Karma YOU not me seem to care about.

First shot was at the Banana(which I hit) , 2nd shot I hit the phone and the banana in same shot. 
All good bro, keep on being bad. I don't even shoot. I'm sure you could out shoot me. I'm an awful shot.

Says people are childish about gun control, then asks why he can't have a nuke. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:00:10
Because I was given a new phone for destroying this one.  There was no "donate a phone and I'll give you a phone thread" 
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:41:43
Should be live 
I shot it a lot. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:44:20
I will, I'm getting things loaded up now and waiting for daylight to break. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:37:35
Ha, it' gets hammered.  I really hope everything still works out. I can't reach round-peg right now, and I have a phone that's been shot to holy hell and back. 
I'm also hungry and missing a banana. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:09:42
Oh man, Being Alpha is totally about going on the internet and talking about being super fucking Alpha 
@_date: 2014-02-13 01:34:16
Did you watch the video?  
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:09:07
Cause he's so fucking alpha bro, too alpha for reddit. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:01:09
Thanks man. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:21:35
Thanks man, that's awesome!. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:00:09
I have an iPhone 4s only :/  It has iOS7, and I could could shoot it w/ a pretty powerful rifle.  
* Okay, said I'm in for the rifle shooting.  I'm just getting my shit together and I'll be heading out to the range. 
Here is the phone, the rifle and a banana for scale. 
*edit 2  
It's uploading now. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:50:56
In the thread, I'm supposed to have  reserved. I drove 45 miles to a gun range and shot mine. I'm encoding the video now. 
Link is live
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:58:13
I've been taking w/ him on email. He's confirmed I'm good to go .
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:34:59
Hey, I have to wait for daylight and the range to open, but I can get a couple of different views of my 4s getting hammered by a 136gr Lapua Scenar that leaves my barrel around 2950 fps. 
Here is the rifle 
Any chance I can have one "reserved"  I will deliver.  
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:31:39
Like a Nexus 5?  I was sent a confirmation already from round peg. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:22:15
Yeah, he sent me an email, said it's all good. My shit is taking forever to transcode, but I'll upload it asap.  I blew that mother up! 
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:46:52
I don't understand why posting my user information explains? 
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:20:29
Custom built by 
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:17:54
I normally do, but I had to edit it pretty fast so I could get it up in time. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:06:23
One camera on me and one camera on the phone. At least at first, then the NEX died.  I have a dual view in the video. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:41:53
By the text overlay at the end?    Very slight IMO. I don't have my team jersey on, or a hat on from my sponsors. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:10:07
Nah, I needed to rezero my bolt gun and get some dope on my AR.  I'll be okay. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:52:54
It was freezing cold and i'm very sick. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 02:20:36
6.5 Creedmoor. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:13:18
It's just part of my channel, it's dedicated to long range shooting and the gear related to it. This was a 1 off, but wanted to keep the guns and stuff in it as it's in line w/ the show. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:48:51
I'm supposed to get a Nexus 5 for doing it. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:21:46
You don't need to use the iPhone and still be under contract. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:58:53
Canon HD video camera. VIXIA H1 I think it is. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:58:58
Oh wow, I'm a Virgin now as well. You sound like a real tough guy. 
Don't pander down brah, keep fighting that good fight.  You can have all my Karma, I care not for it. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:01:28
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:02:22
I've already spoken with him, we're all good. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:09:37
Well that's pretty lame, I specially mentioned I and to drive out and do it. I could have just tossed it into a fire, but wanted the video to have some effect.   Oh well I'll upload it anyway. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:46:42
I was supposed to have a reserved spot for # 2 my video is being uploaded now. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:33:58
32g Black!
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:08:03
Yeah, first and 2nd shots hit the banana. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:02:33
he said to give it to the homeless. It would need a contract plan and need to be activated. 
If you're giving money to a charity that would be nice though. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:53:13
Thanks man, I'm really pumped. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:16:14
So much anger. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:13:24
pun? 
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:22:18
Thank you sir!  I'm loaded up now and heading out to the range.  I'm going to PM you my email we can talk further that way. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:25:22
Normally I would have pegged it first round, but it was COLD, and I'm sick, as well as tired.  * looks like I did get it and the banana on the first shot (at the phone) just not a real solid one. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:37:35
Sony NEX and a really old Cannon 
@_date: 2014-02-13 08:29:01
"edit a mock up getting smash" 
I'd be interested to see that.
