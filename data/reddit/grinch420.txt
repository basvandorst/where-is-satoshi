i got 2 of my friends who had only heard of, but never played magic, to start playing because of mtgo.  its very easy to get new players started because of the free download, no registration required to start playing with some pre-constructed decks

i sold bitcoin and bought golf clubs... 2 years ago =(
oh well i use those golf clubs every week
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:31:42
because i have never bought bitcoins.. always mined them.. now they are worth so much!
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:36:57
ahhh why did i lose my 20 coins gambling like a fool when they were worth $10??
EDIT: i found .12 in my wallet... who wants to gamble
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:08:01
dude i lost 25 bitcoins gambling when they were $7
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:00:01

@_date: 2013-07-27 04:20:34
also games, cigs, candy, jewelry, barbeque, hookahs, possibly knives on sale...  whoever runs this place knows whats up
