What annoys me about being asked all these invasive questions, apart from the fact they make you feel like a criminal, is that I've answered all these questions before for them. Nothing has changed.  Why do I have to answer them again.  Unless they thought I was lying the first time.  Again being made feel like a criminal. I also notice that fiat withdrawal times seem to take a day longer now. I think I might consider another exchange if Bitstamp want to treat their old and loyal customers like this.

Not illegal but if you were trying to hide it from the taxman. I know it wouldn't be freshly mined but it would be as untraceable as if it was freshly mined. Wouldn't it?

It's not often there's a 2% drop in such a short space of time anymore so I still think it was valid to ask. And apparently there was a reason. Some of the more helpful people on the thread told me why.

FDIC is US based and bitcoin is beyond borders. That's the beauty of bitcoin. It's organically growing because people are slowly losing trust in the traditional institutions who have for too long been complicit in the devaluation of people's hard earned money.

5,820,203,717 ounces of gold above ground so divide that by 21,000,000 and you get 277.152558 so multiply that by $1234 to get $342,000. I'll take that as parity.

$1. I first heard of them when they were 10c and was reading up about them for a few weeks and they had gone up to $1 in that time. A friend bought some too at the time. We got very excited when they went up to $32 but then they crashed to $7 and he sold his stash and was delighted he made a couple of thousand dollars. I held on to mine. Sold some in 2013 and bought my house. Hopefully will be able to retire before I'm 50. I'm 44 now.

I had a client whose server got infected with ransomware a couple of years ago.  He paid the ransom and got all his files back except one Access db file (most important file he had) and the last usable backup he had was 4 years old.  4 years of financial data lost.  I ran Recuva on the hard disk and manged to find a 'deleted' version of the file 4 months old so not too bad in the end.  Just saying paying the ransom doesn't always work

99.21875% will be mined in 20 years time. If electricity isn't very cheap by then and/or if bitcoin isn't worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, it's hard to imagine anybody wanting to mine then. How will transactions then be verified?

I bought 80 when they were $1 each. My only regret was waiting. I first heard of them when they were 10 cents each.  I knew a guy who recorded a vinyl EP at the time and managed to sell one of them for 30 bitcoins!

Usually you have to install Tor browser and go to a .onion address to buy your encryption recovery key. These guys are amateurs.

I bought a house in 2013 after first investing in 2011. Kind of sorry I did now but still have some coins that will hopefully see me retiring soon.

And miss out on all that partying and poontang?  My college life would have been soooo much better if I had all that money.

I've been in this game since 2011 and from what I've learned is that bitcoin is magic internet money. That's all you need to know.

I'm retiring in 2020 too at age 47 :-)

It's a bit crass don't you think? With the bitcoin symbol on it, it's not stylish at all.  It's as stylish as having gold taps in your bathroom. Real style is understated.

No fiat currency has intrinsic value only for the fact people accept it has. Bitcoin is no different. But bitcoin is better than fiat in many ways.

Pity I can't go to Russia because I'm a gay.

He facilitated the sale of illegal drugs but you could argue that the US Dollar has also done that but you don't see anyone from the Fed being chucked in a prison. 
But if you think he deserves to be in prison, do you think he should die in prison from old age?
That would seem extremely harsh to me.

Duh, because I need one. What's the point in having loads of money if you don't spend it?

It's not $3000 this morning and you're right. I'll wait a month. Thanks for being the voice of reason.
