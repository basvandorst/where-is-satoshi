Well it’s difficult to say weather or not that is an accurate assessment at this point in time. It is impossible to know what bitcoin will do vs whatever his native currency is over the next few years. 
My statement was a bit irresponsible as there are many parameters of his investment goals that I am unaware of. Saying buy the dip has become reflex for many at this point and it really isn’t nearly a comprehensive enough statement to be taken as legit investment advice.

You are commenting in a btc sub Reddit to observe the world like Dave Chapelle ?
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:15:24
Lol I can see why you would say that , but as someone in a bitcoin sub Reddit , why are you here if you don’t believe in the fundamentals of the project. You shouldn’t be investing in something you don’t believe has long term value. If you do , then you shouldn’t have an issue with a dca strategy. 
You don’t buy when you need it , you buy when you can.  
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:22:50
What was your goal when you bought the bitcoin ? Why did you buy it ? If you hoped to sell it for usd some day , did you have a price in mind ? What is your investment time frame? 
Gotta ask these questions before you make an investment or you are just gambling blind in a game that you don’t understand. I have large holdings in other projects that I know will yield dividends in the near future and continue to pay out. Btc is a straight store of value at this point but the volatility can test your hands big time. 
I hold bitcoin because it’s very possible that the value will increase exponentially. I would look elsewhere for diversification if you think blockchain is the future.

If you have trouble keeping the money locked in, you should look into Omisego “omg” when the network gets up and running you will be able to stake (lock your tokens in) and get paid tx fees as network validator.

You like the lighting network ? Wait till Omisego Network is up and running on plasma (Joseph Poons next creation) Gona be a game changer for payments and scaling 
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:38:29
Fair enough ....There are a lot of factors at work in these markets. I’m not recommending anyone go all in on btc (my Primary interest lies elsewhere) but as someone who has pushed off of it a bunch of times to gain equity in my other holdings, you can see an extremely strong support at 13000 , 12500 and 12000 . Up trend support line at around 11000.  H4 rsi looks very healthy 1 day rsi healthy , weekly has cooled down a bit. It doesn’t look grim to me. 
Outside of Ta, Bitcoin has that special something. Yes , the tech is , well, not the best , fastest , or cheapest. I say those aren’t necessarily negatives. Keep it slow , let it be a store of value and shit as cash. Makes people less inclined to panic sell when it’s expensive. I cant go spend a gold brick at 7-11 either.

@_date: 2018-01-14 14:59:08
Now is when you buy. You double down now , and your dca is decreased so when it does make a move up the loss percentage is minimized further until you reach your entry price at which point you will actually be in profit

Reason quoted “because” . Needless to say I went out and stocked up immediately. No hate on xrp but I don’t personally own any. 
The post was just food for thought to maybe take off the blinders to the rest of the space. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:44:02
I would agree in terms of usd amount for now. As liquidity increases that is something which will change. There are projects on the way that are looking to bridge the gap and make crypto world more accessible.  I think no matter what you have in your portfolio that all can agree on ease of access and more real world use being a good thing.

I’m not saying go all in on some random Alt. I just want the potential of the space to be realized. There are projects not in direct competition with btc that have great potential. I feel like a lot of people mistakenly think it’s btc vs all other digital assets when that couldn’t be further from the truth.  Everything is still very young , but the future is looking bright for the blockchain universe. The post was made with the intention to have people take a look around and understand there are lots of opportunities out there to increase their holdings.  Owning digital gold (btc) will always make sense, but there are a lot of promising things to invest in out there as well. I have my own picks , but I’m not shilling anything except for awareness here.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:33:13
I think that a lot of new comers only know bitcoin which is what I was getting at. The fact that you even know the others exist puts you in the minority of hodlers. I think we forget just how uninformed people are in the scheme of things

Oh of course they are in it for the money, and that’s who Controls the direction , not the guys who bought 100$ worth and are waiting for their lambo. I think we are on the same page here lol  There’s no real basis for valuation outside of speculation . Which is why I buy something like Omisego as an investment  (which will have actual metrics for valuation in the near future) and trade btc for that cash money.

I’d talk to your dad about it . Not an area you want to be fucking with unless you are given the green light (I mean , if you like eating dinner and don’t want to risk that not happening anymore). 
Either way he will probably be impressed you are looking to invest at your age and maybe can give you some guidance.

Technical analysis lol. Almost every pullback on the waves leading up to this ath (all time high) has been down to the .618 on the fibonacci Retracement . Depending on weather or not we crack 6250, the retrace according to history say an 85% chance it will be either to around 4200 or 4500. Keep in mind that doesn’t mean it will stay down there , but it’s pretty likely some downside is on the way . If you are a hodler just go about your day as usual as the odds say the next wave will be a juicy one. Try not to get upset when the “usd” in the blockfolio decreases ....who cares about usd at this point anyway
