That's not an actual position based on the technology, community, adoption, or anything other than the name of the coin... That's not a good argument
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:52:09
What makes you say that?

I know this one! Transfer to Coinbase USD from wherever. Transfer USD from CB to CBPro. Buy there. Takes like 1 minute tops to do it, and that's just my slow computer.

Fiat is I believe

I'm not saying whether it is it isn't a currency, but things are called whatever we want them to be called
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:26:09
I agree that there's much more substance than just 2 years ago, but if it moves as quickly as it has been that's speculation
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:11:34
You're ignoring the different timelines of events
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:49:41
No doom. In my eyes it's very possible we'll never see 10k BTC again. But if it goes to 100k in the next month then it's gonna come back down

That's not really what it says though. It says that the electricity used comes from renewables, mostly hydro. So it's just that miners operate in areas with high renewable use by the local grid - and they likely go there for cheaper energy

I haven't heard this, can you link me somewhere?
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:27:10
If you're on that scale, do $1k now and get used to the swings. Then you'll have something if it goes up
@_date: 2019-06-10 02:34:24
Yes it does, and that's great. It's just not nearly the same as the image of miners rigging up solar panels
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:40:03
Where are you seeing that?
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:05:40
I'm not gonna be too greedy about it. If it's slower I'll wait longer. We'll see. Not certain yet, might take half.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:17:02
At 10k I was hoping it would move slower (i.e. more sustainably) but since that didn't happen bubble here we come I'm cashing out at 60k-75k I think

What do you foresee being the benefit? There's a whole extra axis for information, what do you put there?
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:01:30
That's not the goal. The point is to get something your future wife will really like and cherish for the rest of your life. In some ways it can be a physical manifestations of love. It's not that the more expensive a ring is the more you love a person, that's ridiculous and toxic, but it does show a certain amount it care. It doesn't guarantee anything, but that's not what it's trying to do
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:36:01
This is the most gilded thread I've ever seen. Wow! You're making people's day!
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:03:08
Oh absolutely. But for these purposes if there's less than 50M addresses you can answer the question: not yet
@_date: 2018-04-07 13:10:21
Well it's a maximum number of users. Likely inaccurate but still
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:10:34
I mean that's kinda likely to happen if BTC was used as a currency
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:11:46
Why it BTC deflationary?
@_date: 2018-12-24 18:51:31
The government could still borrow money and have a deficit with Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:28:55
This is not the place to ask. The people here are heavily biased in favor.
But, to answer anyway. Yes, on the condition you're ok with seeing that $100 shrink. It could go down. We've fallen a lot from the ATH, and now's probably a pretty good time honestly, but it's very likely that will fall. And when it does, you have to be ok with waiting for it to come back up again, and ok with the fact it might not ever come back up. Bitcoin is really, really cool, and it's powerful and useful, but it's also a long game. You'll need to be ready to wait at least 6 months, ideally years before you ever get that money back out.

I turned green yesterday! Yes exciting!
