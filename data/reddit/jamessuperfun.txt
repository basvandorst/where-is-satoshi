Yeah, that's expensive as hell and makes up the total amount of most of the times I've used it in one day in that case. Our banks charge like a few £ a day, I see its different over there. Shit, that's half the limit of what my bank charges for an *unarranged* overdraft in a month.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:29:10
I see, here in the UK it's not expensive at all. I go over without realising every now and then, the overdraft charges are all applied at the end of the month. Never been more than a couple of quid. Lloyds quotes £1.70 for a day of £1,200.

This is really solid advice, not sure why it's so contraversial
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:18:17


This is a straight up lie, I live in the UK and had an account with no overdraft for years, but then chose to sign up for one because I prefer the convenience of having one. You could also just speak to the bank in order to have the overdraft deactivated, only a maximum overdraft is common. You can even get kids accounts which can't legally have one.
Nationwide FlexBasic -  


Lloyds Classic Account -  


Royal Bank of Scotland Select Account -  


These are not only the first three I checked, but they're three of the largest banks in the UK. They're not even expensive if you have one, as long as you're using it for what it's intended for: Bridging the gap between a few days of payments. All must provide representative examples by law, for Lloyds:


£2 so I can buy this TV now and not wait until that transfer comes through on Thursday? That's fair in my eyes, and a useful service. If you don't want it you have that choice, disliking banks doesn't mean you should lie about them - don't apply for one. And transactions are instant if you use the correct type, if not there's something wrong. Every major bank offers an app where you can see your transactions, as well as pending transactions. Try Nationwide, for example.

As opposed to having it declined? Nah I'd rather just pay £5 to borrow it from the bank for a few days. I don't see how these fees are unreasonable.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:32:07
But you can apply for normal accounts without an overdraft? They aren't relevant to the discussion at hand. There are some accounts without overdrafts which you can only get if you can't get others, but there are other accounts which most people can get without an overdraft, and they're extremely common - which is directly opposed to what you previously said. You can also typically get a better account if you specifically request to not have an overdraft for something else, for example the main product FlexAccount by Nationwide. I'm saying get account A, but you're saying a term in account B says you can't get it. It's a different account, and account A is not restricted in the same manner.
Oh, I see. Have you not asked the bank about this? I find it strange that this isn't an option, if it was a big concern you could even get a prepaid card. Alternatively, standing orders are usually available wherever direct debit is but is of course less convenient. Direct debit also has a host of laws requiring the person to be informed clearly about any charges.
Yeah, so they're borrowing money they can't pay back. That doesn't make the person offering the service morally incorrect, there's a reason it's restricted in who can use it and I don't see any predatory advertising. And what principle, short term small loans? I don't see what's wrong with that? Unless you know that money is on the way, you should not enter an overdraft, and this is clearly stated by the bank. It is intended to bridge the gap between payments, not as a long term tool to support yourself. The simple fact that you're struggling is often enough to have the bill reduced or removed, provided you contact them, with a big hit to your credit score. How is it the banks fault that some customers cannot control their spending? I feel bad and I'm glad these people have support, but that doesn't mean the bank is wrong for having offered the service.
Overdraft fees are far, far higher in America where this is quoting. The fees we're looking at aren't unreasonable and I'd bet our banks are making much less from overdraft fees.

So assuming you don't have another current account, you could get one without an overdraft. While it isn't advertised, I did not have an overdraft on my FlexPlus with them. I did overlook that part on the site though, you're quite right. It says here, for their main account: 


I didn't link you to the basic account, I linked you to the classic account, their main card without additional benefits (which are for a monthly fee). Again, it's clear reading Lloyds FAQs that you can have a normal account without an overdraft. 
Once more, this is not the Foundation account, this is the Select account. You're finding different accounts that are specifically for people with terrible credit that can't open normal accounts, there are normal accounts available that do not support or require overdrafts and most people can open.
You're paying £25 for direct debit? It's free for Nationwide.
My bank just prevents transactions, or it did previously. I understand unarranged overdrafts are a thing, but I can't seem to find any sources on which transaction types these are applied to. Chip and pin, for example, was just denied. MoneyAdviceService are clear that you can have no charges on request. 
£55 a month to borrow £1,200 as an extremely short term loan from the bank? Seriously, that's unreasonable? It's not even common to have an overdraft that large. Don't borrow £1,200 when you can't pay it back? I do feel bad for those who get trapped in debt but you can't blame the person offering this service. It's a perfectly useful service for the majority of users, and doesn't seem in any way predatory to me. Why should I have the choice of paying for such a service taken away from me because some others can't control their spending? Already there are systems in place to deny access to those people.
Are you paying attention to the "Pending transactions" figure? Banks also often charge nothing if the difference is solved within a short period like a day.

Strongly agreed. It's a real pain in the ass to keep having to check the exchange rate, it might be doable roughly in my head if I wasn't counting zeroes. I'd probably find it much easier if it was in a more standard format, mBTC fits.

I'm really struggling to make my mind up on where to go from here. I sold a bit, then bought back in like 10 mins later wasting £20ish lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:59:38
Made a few trades near the bottom then started riding it back up with more than I had, does that count as hodling?

Buyers will need to have money with them (and lots), sellers have a minimum withdraw.

It has been used as a currency by some there, the USD as well, but the government is trying to stop USD being used. Mining is also very popular as the people can earn money from it, electricity is cheap in these places and that same btc can buy you a lot more. Crypto is volatile as fuck like their currency, but bitcoin and various other major altcoins are generally trending up. So yeah, some people are literally using crypto to put food on the table because they have no other choice.

Bastards, I actually went and looked up the notebook (with confusion).

But they're already rich, and probably don't give a shit.

Where does it say it was delayed? Was the 10th and 18th not the original date?

Every exchange is in it for their own gain. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:07:32
No, it doesn't. I don't know where you got that idea. Last year BTC went up nearly every day in December, the biggest drop in a day was 2.58%. 
1st Dec: $755
31st Dec: $966
Largest single day drop: $919 - $895 (2.5%), off a 7% gain the previous day.

You know you can fuck before you marry, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:52:59
As an unmarried, single man, I really don't get this. If the person you married means that much, you should be supportive of their hobbies. The idea that you aren't talking or have to hide this from the person you're supposed to trust the most is crazy to me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:15:41
Most people are having sex whenever they want long before they get married. If that's all you're getting married for, you shouldn't be getting married. Marriage is a purely emotional thing, it isn't about sex. Living together and fucking regularly is normal, without getting married. Most people find they have sex less after marriage. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:28:53
But how is it the bank's fault that customers are transferring money into crypto? I'm struggling to see how this fits into any legal framework driven even remotely by logic. If a customer transfers funds the bank holds in trust, then it's got nothing to do with the bank or the banks taxes, it's about where the consumer chooses to take their money. Unless it can be shown that the bank is somehow encouraging these transactions I can't see how they're responsible.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:29:23
They view it that way because by far the most popular cryptocurrency is terrible at being used as an actual currency. Look at the OP, hell I'm even one of the people who uses it to buy weed. The tech is the future, but it's a really shitty currency.

And I think people are learning the harsh reality that people fucking suck. It will always become about profit.
