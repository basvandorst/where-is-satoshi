Well, I guess we will just have to disagree, but at least this discussion probably has provided some information to someone about the differences between wallets :)
@_date: 2014-06-19 21:11:58
Has been added, yes :)

You shouldn't have to copy-paste anything in order to send BTC, with Pheeva I just scanned the QR-code the waitress provided and hit send; easy.
It might be outside their comfort zone to sign up to a coop, but that wasn't what we were discussing. You claimed that bitwallet is far ahead of any other ios wallet. My counter claim is that Pheeva is a superior ios wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:58:34
Pheeva is miles ahead of bitwallet, check it out.
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:25:31
Also, in the future we might send transactions through more than just one master node, increasing privacy even more.

I laughed xD
Very true, although he's a hell of a smart guy and I enjoy reading many of his posts :)

Your wallet is encrypted like any other wallet and you can make a back up of it. I don't see the problem.
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:49:14
Darkcoin does this at protocol level, decentralized. It scares me that Dark wallet is centralized.. And its an extension for your browser.
Happy cake day btw :)
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:09:27
Pheeva has an easy way to send coins, bitwallet doesn't. I think Pheeva is everything I want in a mobile wallet.
Why does it matter if it is in the app store or not? You do NOT have to jailbreak in order to install Pheeva and it was really easy to do aswell :)
@_date: 2014-04-01 18:30:12
An alternative to DarkWallet is Darkcoin's DarkSend feature which is implemented in the protocol itself for anonymous transactions.
Really interesting technology that I hope to see implemented in Bitcoin some day :)
@_date: 2014-06-20 09:34:06
Pheeva tells you that there is a new version when you launch it along with a button that says update. You click update and it updates itself. I actually think it works better than App Store update as it is actually easier and it tells you when to update.
I think Pheeva will come to the App Store if Apple changes their stand, but I think this is unlikely.
@_date: 2014-06-18 08:51:37
Pheeva is awesome for ios :)
@_date: 2014-12-29 05:05:53
The only laughable thing in your post is that you assume dollars will exist in 2100 :')
@_date: 2014-06-03 08:51:51
Dark Wallet is just another centralized mixing service requiring trust. 
Darkcoin has this built into the protocol. Decentralization is the whole point of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2014-06-18 23:13:30
What do you mean fr key? Do you mean importing paper wallets via QR-code? 'Cause Pheeva supports that.
@_date: 2014-12-29 05:22:21
how so?
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:28:25
Thank you! \^\^
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:56:49
Yes indeed, I loved that one aswell!
I also really like [this by Jeffrey Tucker and Andreas.](
I will email my professor more if he asks for it :)

Bitcoin doesn't have these problems as the finite inflation occouring today will diminish in the future.
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:18:10
Not exactly.. Overstock accepts bitcoin as a payment option from their customers, thus they can use those bitcoins for paying their employees :)

It is a cheap brick called Nokia with an internet connection, a camera and long battery life. This is perfect for poor and rural places.

I'm not saying they should hold for two weeks. All I'm saying is that they can hold for more time than none at all. They will have to decide themselves what is responsible.
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:09:49
Good job :) I once gave away private keys on social media in a similar fashion to challenge my friends. Incredible to see how much easier hosting giveaways like this just became!
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:28:03
You kind of answered your own question: If they had some bills to pay in bitcoin (salaries), they would have a reason for not converting everything. They can mitigate the risk by converting the bitcoin they don't need to usd, and buying more bitcoin if so need be.
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:18:53
Happy cake day :)

I've been playing for like two hours without receiving anything :-/
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:31:55
Thank you for the interesting read :)
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:48:53
and bitcoin hasn't consistently gained value in the past two years?
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:56:05
oh, I see you gave tickets to my reddit username, unfortunately I'm named something else in your app :-/ thx though
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:06:58
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:42:16
What really matters is the total transaction fees in every block. If there's a lot of transactions you don't need so high fee per transaction, but if it's only a few transactions they will have to pay for the whole block.
Another way to read this is: Bitcoin needs to be used by a lot of people in the future in order to be successful.
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:29:47
I tried sharing on facebook, but I didn't get the 5 tickets :-/
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:44:50
Like said: They can convert as much as they need to or seem fit. My point is that it's not an all or nothing kind of question. The best way to do this probably lies somewhere in between; as with most things in this world :)
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:56:57
Too bad :-/ Seems a lot of people got like 20 tips in half an hour, while others like me got none in 2 hours.. sigh
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:47:49
I'm not saying they should keep money they really need in bitcoin. I'm only saying it's a possibility to keep some, and it's up to them.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:22:47
Having the freedom to do what suits you the best is great, huh? :)
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:48:04
If I knew that I'd be very rich :) All I'm saying is that people already buying bitcoin could want to be paid a precentage in bitcoin instead/aswell. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:11:33
Payouts are active again! But the pot is draining fast :S
@_date: 2015-01-08 02:00:10
Poor != technically disinclined
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:41:57
Like said: If I'm already using 20% of my salary to buy it, why not just get it as 20% of my salary? Also, I'll take the daily fluctuations instead of the steady decline in the fiat world. My fiat savings won't be worth anything in the future.
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:45:02
Probably :) 
He says it in [this video]( which I really recommend if you haven't seen it!
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:21:12
You could probably choose how much of the salary you want in bitcoin. Say you choose 20% and use half of it for buying stuff when you get the chance to use bitcoin. Then you only keep 10%, or whatever number, for the long-term risk. It would be completely up to you :)
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:42:21
He said: "Show me a currency you can't buy drugs with, and I'll show you something that isn't a currency." :)
@_date: 2015-01-09 19:25:18
For the same reasons people buy bitcoin: Spending or saving. Also I think you're overlooking the opportunity of only taking a percentage of the salary as bitcoins. Say I'm using 20% of my fiat salary to convert into bitcoin, why wouldn't I want to simplify the process by being paid 20% bitcoin? :)
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:14:02
I actually lol'd
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:05:45
thank you :)

You're welcome :)

Noone is going to exchange paper for something as valuable as FOOD in a country in that dire a situation.
@_date: 2015-01-09 20:18:50
The point in holding an amount you know you will spend is that you don't need to convert it twice, obviously. Like said: What they find to be a responsible period of time to hold is up to them.
@_date: 2015-03-14 13:15:19
I'm humbled by you quoting me, but I'm not a dev though :) hehe
Edit: Thanks for spreading the word!
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:35:39
Yes, Coinjoin **is** flawed because it doesn't use denominations, Darksend uses denominations and **is not** flawed.
You should educate yourself instead of resorting to personal attacks on both me and a good dev which have invented many new technologies. Shame on you.
@_date: 2015-03-19 00:59:33
In the mean time there does exist other currencies providing anonymity as well. Coinjoin is broken :-/
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:27:47
Please elaborate your claim.. Darksend is not a flawed clone of Coinjoin. It actually uses denominations of inputs and several rounds of mixing.
You are welcome to try to break the anonymity if you want; please report your findings.
@_date: 2015-02-04 15:00:57
Another solution is to lock the transactions in place before the next block so that they cannot be forged. An example of an implementation is Darkcoin's InstanTX. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:10:28
It's not moving network-wide consensus to private consensus of masters.. It's about the network locking in place the first transaction received and disregarding others that would have caused collision. It's actually really clever, go look it up :)
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:08:26
Did anyone notice that the address used to claim the coins started with 1PoLE? The BTC attached to a pole was claimed by a PoLE.
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:48:58
I will pass on any tips to worthy causes and people who deserve a little something :-)
