When you buy from coinbase, your funds appear instantly. Register with coinbase, buy the btc there. Then go to gdax and login with your Coinbase username/pw and transfer the funds from there at zero fees.

Depends what you wanna buy. If just BTC, then coinbase is your best bet. Buy, then send them to your own wallet like electrum. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:39:43
Nope. With BTC, you are your own banker.
For future reference: if your transaction doesn't get processed in 2 weeks it gets returned to your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:59:30
Doubt it. You can't use Electrum's seed in any other wallet, for example. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:39:40
What you're "supposed" to do is report all your capital gains for the year. Meaning, if you put in 10k, but the total value at the end of the year is 15k, then your capital gains are 5k. So it doesn't matter if it's in 10 wallets or 1, gains are gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:18:04
If you're *extremely* lucky, you may be able to recover you lost bitcoins from the Mt. Gox hack.
And yes, if you had btc in coinbase during the BCH and BTG forks, you will get them. January 1st coinbase will be releasing the BCH coins. No idea about when BTG will be released. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:07:03
Well, it's all speculative. I'm with you in thinking this is good for BTC. I think there's a chance prices will dip because of this, but soon enough btc will recover and return to its upward trend.
But, like everyone else, I could be wrong. Invest what you can afford to lose.

You can't. Coinbase doesn't allow Canadians to sell back into fiat. You can, however, transfer your BTC to a different exchange that does allow withdrawals to Canadian bank accounts. It takes a while to get ID verified and to get your account set up at almost all of them.
I recommend 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:32:04
Take my upvote! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:05:08
Safest way is to move your BTC to a new wallet with a new seed. After that you can try Electron cash with the old seed for the BCH , and then coinomi using your private keys to get the BTG (it's annoying and time consuming if you have a lot of transactions, but worth it). 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:37:40

I also doubt it. Most people don't even know about the upcoming forks. This is all due to the CME imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:57:57
Yeah. They'll end up somewhere. Either returned to your wallet or on the exchange. I went through the same thing last year. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:08:27
As far as I know you don't get taxed unless you cash out. How would they know about it if you hold your own private keys in a wallet (off an exchange)?

You're WRONG and also rude AF. Electrum is not BIP39, and therefore you absolutely cannot go entering your seed from electrum into another wallet. Get off your high horse and check your facts before you attempt to be a know-it-all prick.

I gifted BTC to a bunch of people who really have no idea what cryptocurrecy is, but have at least heard of Bitcoin.
(I also had the foresight to keep a copy of the private addresses in case they lose their paper wallets).
Like another poster mentioned, I could have used gdax and avoided all fees. My fault entirely.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:41:18
Not gonna say how much, but I got into BTC in 2015. ETH in 2016. More BTC and other alts in early 2017. My portfolio is now more than 7000% my fiat investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:03:22
I believe this fluctuation will stabilize once mass adoption takes place. Bitcoin is still in its infancy in this regard.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:04:25
This was back in 2014 when BTC machines were few and far between where I'm located, and the limit per person per day was $5k/atm. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:03:26
Yes and no. It depends. Most wallets use BIP39, and therefore you can use your seed in them interchangeably. Electrum, on the other hand, does not use BIP39. So, if your seed is from there it can only be used there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:52:36
Good luck to you. I hope you get rich and find help! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:53:32

In all fairness, not *all* forks are to make BCH look bad. Some are just to make money with premining, some are pure scams, some truly believe they have something new/better/innovative to offer, and yes some are to make others look bad (ie. January 2nd Bitcoin Cash Plus fork). 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:51:30
Yeah. Like I said you're "supposed" to report your gains. But technically speaking, if your coins are in a wallet (not on an exchange), how on earth would they ever know what you hold until you decide to cash out.

Happened to a friend of mine at work. They paid to unlock a few crucial computers/servers, and reimage the rest. After the ransom was paid they did regain access. It's a really shitty thing that has happened, but I hope it all works out for you.
Coinbase will only let you buy a tiny amount until you're verified. Depending on the ransom, if you want this paid quickly it may be worth going to a bitcoin ATM and getting them that way.

A little more complicated for getting the BTG in coinomi, as you have to enter in all your private keys. 
Like explosive_diahrrea said, make sure you first transfer your BTC to a new electrum wallet, because you will be using the same keys/seed to access your BCH and BTG.

BTC was first. It has that going for it. Just wait for the lightning network, and Roger won't have anything to say. 
BCH is a knock-off. Is it faster? Yes, for now. Are transactions cheaper? Yes, for now. 
But, what is unique about BCH? Is it the fastest altcoin out there? Not a chance. Is it the cheapest altcoin out there for transactions? No again.

Many people said the exact same thing at 3k, 9k, and 15k (a few days ago).
Does BTC have the potential to go higher? Hell yes. I hope to see it at 100k by this time next year. But if it goes back to 5k, I know it's money I can afford to lose.

I sent more than 6 figures for a $21 fee and it was there and had 3 confirmations in 10 mins or so. I didnt think it was too high at all.
Though, now all the BCH supporters will be telling me I could have done this for pennies even faster with BCH. Blah blah real bitcoin, faster, cheaper, satoshis true vision, blah blah. 
And, my response is if I wanted to deal with BCH I would have. And, if I wanted it FREE I would have done it with IOTA. But I wanted to deal purely with BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-19 18:55:16

My average for today was around $20/transaction.
For example: Transferred 0.009 and only 0.0075 made in into a few wallets. Others were lower and some higher.
It's my fault. I wasn't thinking and should have used GDAX.
On the flip side, I transferred 6 BTC from electrum  and it only cost me $8 and it was processed the next block a few days ago. At the same time I transferred 1 BTC from Ledger Nano and it only cost me $1 (using Segwit).
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:34:35
$100 USD, if purchased right now, would be 0.0068 BTC.
Tomorrow 0.0068 BTC could be worth more than $100 or less than that amount. It depends on the market. Bitcoin has its dips, but the trend is upwards. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:56:35
I haven't invested too much. Low 5 figures. But that's because I got in relatively early a few years ago. My fear now isn't about losing the money I've invested, but rather losing the 50x I've made in profits. Once you invest you'll have new fears, unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:22:08
Agreed. I sent a large sum of btc from electrum to a trezor a few days ago. Paid $XX in fees, it was sent the next block, but that was far less than 0.01% of the total value sent.
Two years ago I paid a few pennies in fees, but the percentage was higher.
It's all relative.

I also bought a bunch when they were relatively cheap. Although I panicked a bit when the "crash" happened a few days ago, I never thought of selling for 3 reasons:
1) I don't need the money right now that badly that I need to cash out. 
2) I am entirely confident BTC will recover from this blip and will continue it's upward trend.
3) I believe in the future of crypto and I don't think I'll ever need to convert it back to fiat.

Every investment is somewhat of a gamble, even gold. BTC rises and falls, but it has an upwards trend and still has massive growth potential. 
With that being said, *Invest what you can afford to lose.*

Canadian here. Bought with a credit card and received coins instantly. Fees are ok.

Please share. Just bought again at ATH.

A few years back I tried convincing my husband to buy. He had no idea what bitcoin was and didn't believe in it. I came into a bunch of cash and went to a few BTC ATMs (5% markup fee at the time) and bought some coins. He advised me to only buy 1, but I didn't listen and bought more. Now he admits I was right, and he's become obsessed with crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:08:45
Exactly. None of this "wait for the dip" stuff. There may be no dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:11:53
It doesn't make me feel any better knowing others are further down than I am.
I am confident BTC will rebound in no time, but it's still a tough thing to HODL through. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:47:10
Bitcoin is actually only a part of the "everything bubble" 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:16:28
Please tell me this is satire. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:43:05
Never too late. I bought at 300, 4500, 7000, and most recently at 14,500.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:46:44
Much easier that way.

I'm not saying Kraken is perfect by any means. Just addressing the first point of your post about the guy that lost 60k.
On the flip side, I contacted Kraken today about a verification issue, and I was responded to and had the issue resolved in less than 10 minutes. I can't say the same for coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:55:11
Perfect comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:05:46
What's to say you wouldn't have sold at $50? Or the next dip. Or the next?

If you build it, we will come.

What about Frank's Red Hot?

Sent 6 figures from Electrum to Ledger Nano S a few days ago for a $21 fee. It was confirmed the next block.

Ha ha? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:54:38
After 2 weeks if the transaction doesn't clear the funds should be returned to your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:31:55
Your first point is the most important. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:50:01
Could be waiting a long time. I know plenty of people waiting for it to dip to 5k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:44:31
Search reddit for users who said the exact same thing at 5k, 7k, 10k, etc. They're still waiting for their "dips".

Hope so, but huge sell walls to burn through. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:12:59
That's how my husband felt about the coins I bought years ago... Until they went up the first 2500%. Now, another year later, he's obsessed with crypto.

Looking at Blockfolio every few hours has definitely become an addiction for me. It's the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning.

I've read in a few places the value of 1 BTC, with mass adoption, would plateau around the 2.5mil USD mark. Is that enough for you to comfortably do everything on your list? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:21:48
What's worse is the crap that gets posted on r/btc. Do they have nothing better to do than complain about Bitcoin (core) day in and day out?! It seems they take everything as a personal attack on them (ie. BTG and BCD), they can't stop praising BCH and comparing it to BTC, and so much whining about being "satoshis vision" and "the real bitcoin". Get over it already. Start taking about the merits of BCH, rather than coming off as a bunch of whiners. Boo hoo. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:59:35
Actually *this* Sunday is kinda a huge deal for BTC. It's the first day it's listed on the futures exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:50:17
2 million. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:20:52
About as much value as BCD, I would imagine. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:11:12
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:05:17
The volume of LTC went nearly ten times a few days before futures. Same happened before segwit2x. Expect it to happen again. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:36:58
You could be waiting for a dip that may never happen. When it was around 3000, I wanted to buy more. It shot up to 3400. I thought I'd wait for a dip. Finally gave in and bought more around 4500. Same thing happened around 7k. Sometimes there simply aren't dips. Even if you buy at an all time high, BTC has an upward trend. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:30:15
My wallet is ready for it! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:57:00
Hey now. Let's not assume all BTC supporters are BCH bashers. Pretty sure the quote you're giving is actually very opposite. More like all over the bitcoin cash sub they say "BTC sucks, small blocks. Our blocks are bigger. Satoshis true vision. Etc." 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:23:05
The reason for the new seed is for security reasons. Your BTC and BCH share the same seed. If you've already transferred your BTC since the fork, or if you're not concerned with potentially risking your BTC, you can skip step 1.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:07:56
1) Yes
2) Aside from Bitcoin, my money is in VTC, POWR, IOTA, LSK, OMG, ARK, XMR, and ETH. 
I also hold smaller amounts in XRP, XEM, XLM, DNT, EMC2, and ZRX. 
And, I'm planning to buy ADA, KNC, WTC, and SALT. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:24:09
Stay-at-home mom. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:58:06
I bought at $300, then $4,500, and today at $7,300 (goodbye BCH) if that makes you feel any better. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:45:11
True story. I have a family member (40+) employed in the investments market. He's always trying to convince me to invest in stocks, annuities, etc. For years I've been telling him about Bitcoin, to which he says, "I don't believe in that. It's a bubble. Worthless bubble." Not a single investment through him would have yielded the same returns I've made from Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:22:56
I like your optimism! To the moon! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:03:12
Honestly I have no idea how I heard about it or what got me to buy. I just rmemeber thinking about it for months in 2015, and then finally going to a bitcoin atm and buying my first bunch of bitcoins (at $300). I also remember my husband saying over and over again it was a waste of money. Well, now he's obsessed with Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:12:51
I'm not worrying about it until I decide to sell. And, should it be a hugely substantial amount of money, I may temporarily emigrate to a country with no capital gains, declare non-residency, and return a year later. It really depends how much money we are taking about. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:18:16
I use Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitfinex, and Yobit. (Preference in that order). 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:42:30
Didn't make major money "yet", I mean. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:09:10
I find this to be like "the fox and the sour grapes". They didn't get in on it early enough to make major money from it, so therefore it must be a bubble. I feel your pain. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:10:56
The difference is the value this "money printed out of thin air" has. Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Cash weren't "printed" with the same value as BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:16:03
Would it be more profitable to just invest in Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:42:58
Sounds like only 10x better. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:42:00
Plus it costs more than you'll ever mine on your own, unless you're very, very lucky. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:56:41
Even with the right equipment and free electricity it's just not profitable. You can't compete with mining farms. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:55:03
Ha. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:26:56
I accidentally sent a 1 sat/byte a few months back. It was for a huge sum, too. 6 long days later the transaction cleared. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:44:17
Same here (March in Canada). 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:26:30
I felt the same way at $300. Then $4500. Then $7200.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:28:55
How can I access my (almost worthless) BTG and dump it? I use Electrum for the most part. Coinomi isn't recognizing my seed. Already got rid of my BCH using my old seed, so I know it works. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:05:31
Easiest is a bitcoin atm. Highest fees, but fastest and easiest. No id necessary. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:42:11
Why do you follow this sub? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:31:35
This. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:20:55
I did this myself today. Sold all my BCH for BTC. And I also use electrum.
1) Create a new wallet in Electrum with a new seed and transfer your BTC to that wallet. Once your coins are in there and confirmed, proceed to step 2. (This took me 36 hours at the highest fee electrum would allow). 
2) Download and install Electron Cash (similar interface to Electrum). Use your original seed from where your BTC originally was when the fork happened to access your BCH.
3) Send your coins from Electron Cash to Bitfinex or any other exchange that supports BTC/BCH.
Edit: Mistakenly thought Electron Cash was made by the same people as Electrum. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:47:17
The sending btc transaction appeared in Electrum and my balance went to 0, but it said 0 confirmations. On my new wallet it showed x number of BTC sent (also 0 confirmations). Then hours later when I opened electrum again, my original wallet showed my full balance and no sent transaction, and my new wallet showed a zero balance and no transactions in progress. This happened numerous times throughout the day where either the transactions disappeared or appeared without confirmations. Eventually, however, it went through.

@_date: 2017-11-28 17:03:41
Did the same last week. No regrets. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:23:14
Not necessarily. With news of an upcoming fork, the demand for BTC was higher. More people invested more money. It wasn't out of nowhere. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:20:17
Or Canada. Cannabis will soon be sold at all LCBO locations throughout Ontario alongside liquor. (Liquor in Ontario is ONLY sold at an LCBO, and soon the sale of cannabis will also be exclusive to these locations). The LCBO is owned and operated by the government.

In what scenario would someone ever say, "No, I don't want to receive xx bitcoins from xx address?"

Yes, exactly this!

No idea about that site. But never sell on PayPal. Even cashing out using a bitcoin ATM is better than PayPal.

@_date: 2017-11-17 05:38:44
Been there, seen that in the past 24 hours. Scary for me because I moved ALL my btc to a new wallet. It shows up, then hours later it's gone. Shows up again, then gone. Eventually, it'll confirm and go through. Mine did at least. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:54:05
Bought myself a Ledger Nano S last night. Time to get them off my computer (electrum) and into the safe.

I have been waiting for this day myself! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:08:25
I have this issue as well. I have a will, but nothing in there about my crypto holdings. I ended up giving all my wallet/exchange info to a trusted family member. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:46:10
Use Electrum wallet. Search Google on how to deposit into an electrum wallet after you set one up. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:43:55
It isn't? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:26:11

I wasn't always a stay-at-home mom, but I decided to put my career on hold when my kids were born. And, I've always been interested in tech stuff. A few years ago I read something about Bitcoins and decided to take a leap of faith and invest a chunk of money into bitcoin (against my husband's and everyone else's "better judgment"). He's changed his tune since then, and we've convinced many family members and friends to follow in our footsteps.
