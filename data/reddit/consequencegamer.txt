Taking a read and going on what you said, it seems there is a disconnect.


This is key, because you would only know in hindsight.
I guess what I am trying to get at, is what you are saying is similar to someone who wins the lottery. Looking back, they beat the odds and won. But compare them to everyone else, and it was just luck.
If there are people buying, the price can rise (but it can also go the other way...). So you selling just before the peak, could be driving the price up. You specifically could have contributed to it going up, or down...it is hard to say which way.
For each trade, there is a buyer and a seller. For a seller to sell before the peak, that means a buyer bought before the peak. That is what I am struggling with, because you are only considering half of it. If selling before a peak helps stabilize things, how? Because for that to happen, someone bought at the peak too.
That is what I gather at least. Reading through the Market Impact wiki, it basically says every trade has an impact. It did not state exactly what you are mentioning.
EDIT: I think I get what you are going for. Lets say the price is rising from $10 to $11 and you sell at $10.50. You are essentially slowing down the value of the stock. Is this what you mean ?

thanks! I get it now. Winner winner chicken dinner.

for an apple guy, this is surprising,
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:16:56
That makes no sense. Can you explain a bit more how it stabilizes the price?
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:38:59
Maybe I'm clueless, but what you suggest simply makes no sense. I'm trying to understand what you are saying but it honestly makes no sense.  Sorry :(

This is an awesome bot!

This. People don't get it. The "value" outside of bitcoin is what people give it. The "general" public give it say 10,000 USD, but some individuals value it more or less. Some might trade it for 10 kittens, while some might do 2 kittens. The value once you go outside of bitcoin to bitcoin can vary greatly. That is what is so interesting about trading it for USD, it kind of gets rid of the whole decentralization of cryptocurrency. I am no expert, just my 2 cents of rambling.

Reading what you wrote, just does not make sense. You are applying hindsight logic to make a correlation. Maybe I am wrong in my understanding, but that is how it appears.
What you are saying, only applies on a peak, or dip. But it is not a peak until it does drop. Otherwise, it is a normal transaction. So, one cannot say someone selling drops the price. Only until the price drops, can you say that. But, it is not always the case.

You joke, but every country will have their own main bitcoin they support. It will eventually turn into how currency is handled today.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:16:33
Because it treats bitcoins as an investment instead of the end goal which is currency. Bitcoin is super volatile right now and what it needs is mass adoption for the true end goal. It cannot hit that if everyone is treating it like an investment.

Again, you cannot tell the future so it is impossible to buy before a full dip, and sell before a peak.

hijacking this since I want this answered and I'm greedy.
Does anyone know of a site that has a list of sites that HAVE been affected? I can check the sites I regularly use but a lot are patched (and I have no way of knowing if they were vulnerable to begin with). I would like to know what sites I have visited which have been affected. 
I have only found a few documents but nothing too in depth.  
@_date: 2014-04-09 21:52:22
Thank you for this, I ended up stumbling on it earlier and failed as a posted to reply back with it.
Edit: I am happy to see that "most" of the top 10,000 that are/were infected are sites I never heard of

You don't hide your folder contents? This guy doesn't "homework" well.

What does this mean? I don't quite understand it.

That type of thinking is how hoarders are created (or, even worse issues). If you never spent a dime, you would own nothing. If you kept everything, you would live in filth. You have to have a reasonable line, otherwise, life will be hectic, and you will drive yourself crazy. "Oh man, I can't spend this penny!!! It might be worth something someday."
No one can tell the future. If you spent $1million worth of bitcoin today, for a pizza back in the day...all the power to you.

blackflag209 is using afford wrong. Your post is pretty helpful, maybe he can understand better.

the nurses I know get paid so much money. They also get their school practically covered and get bonuses for becoming nurses. They are not small bonuses either. If Nurses are underpaid, EVERYONE is grossly underpaid in my area.

I could be a millionaire today if I didn't buy so much (what seems to be) useless junk. I could have been a millionaire if  I bought a bunch of bitcoin in the past. I could have saved myself so much money in debt if I saved up money before going off to school....
Hindsight is a killer. Don't let it eat you up.
