None of their business.  Did they help you make the money somehow?
@_date: 2019-11-25 22:23:55

Sweet, what digital protocol was used?  Olivia, PKS?  Unfortunately you would still need the internet for a transaction, but maybe that will change in future.  It would be almost impossible to to a sync the blockchain over 20m radio,  way to slow over current radio technology.

WTF?  Learn some history!

Not about the flag.  It's what it represents.  The people of the world should know, and know it well.  In the world of instant, unlimited information, it's not that extremely difficult to educate yourself.  Turn off "Dancing with the Stars", "the view" and the other bullshit and wake the fuck up.

Learn it,, or be condemned to repeat it

How they know your intentions?  If they asked,  why did you tell them?

Add some LED background effects.

@_date: 2019-10-30 22:58:29

Most of those type of restrictions are government enacted.  The banks cant not allow you to move money as fast as they can and banks see that as a threat.  That would give you an equal benefit thats only reserved for banks.  Another good reason to support and drive crypto adoption at the peril of fraud banksters.

It is not.  Defacing to alter its value is against the law.

im sold on bitcoin and crypto.  He made some very valid points.   Thats exactly why the world needs a decentralized store of value.

Less new supply, existing circulating BTC will not change.  Idea is to curtail inflation.  In past halving, BTC has increased in price after event.  Its every 210,000 blocks, not really tied to date but estimated bout year from now.  I hope it's a mofo moon shot, and will be if demand for BTC  increases significantly.

They price it in,  they keep mining.
