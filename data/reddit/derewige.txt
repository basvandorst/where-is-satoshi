Kraken is one of the larger teading platforms.
In the last 30 days the tradin volumen for bitcoin on Kraken was 347k. 
That is way over 2 billion dollars.
So they earned somwhere between 2 million and 8 millions in fees for bitcoi  trading alone.
Total fees for all altcoins somwhere between 6 and 32 million dollars.

Strangely enough the fees for withdrawal in Euro is much lower (0.09 Euro) compared to withdrawal in Bitcoin (about 3.5 Euro at current price).
But to be honest: I would be surprised if the income from withdrawal fees amount to more than 1% of the income from trading fees.

Well it did for the past 30 years: 
It is logarithmic scale, so a straight line means exponential growth.
And the number of transistors on a chip still follow it. The only thing that stopped (till now) is the increase in Herz.

I always asumed that all the developed countrys would have something like SEPA in the Euro zone.
How come the USA got stuck in the stone age?

For over 2 months the mempool is now (mostly empty).
For a fee of 5 sat/b you will normaly bee within the next block.
That means that the average waiting time for a 5 sat/b transaction for the first confirmation is about 6 minuts. (Estimation)
5 sat/b nets to less then 10 cent for a normal transaction.

There is a maximum blocksize.
The time it takes to mine a block is constant.
Therefore the blockchain grows in a linear way.
Currently moore's law still holds.
Storage media therefore grow in an exponental way.
As long as this is true.
The cost for a full node will drop again in the future. 
(When the exponental curve overtakes the linear one)

The mempool is empty since 3 momths now.
Fees can't get lower than what they have been for this 3 months.
More batching and increased segwit adoption will help keeping the fees low.
But they do not lower them at this point.

She's feed up by the high fees, bad exchange rates and regulations, that services like western union offer.

Because no other currency matters

Did the monthly average BTC price rise by more than 20% or more in less than 6 months?
If the answer is no, then it is no bull market

Thats easy to explain.
Trading bots. One can easily trade 20 to 100 times as much volume as you own each day.

More context:
After the crash of MtGox I received an mail (real mail, not an e-mail) by the lawyer handling the bankruptcy.
Explaining the situation and how I could submit a claim to my funds.
As I had only very small funds on MtGox at the time of the crash, I did not bother to submit a claim.
After this I received several e-mails remembering me of the deadline to submit my claim.
Then a few years later I received a new mail stating, that the procedure had changed and everyone needed to lay a new claim.
And also everyone not yet claimed could claim again. (Again I did not bother)
3 months ago, I received a notice, that they filled automatic claims for everyone with funds at the time of crash.
(According to the user DB of MtGox)
But other users objected to this. And if I would like to reinforce my claim I would need to do so.
(as I was bored at this time, I wrote back to do so)
Now today I received the mail, that the objection was retracted.
And all auto claims are now valid and no further steps are needed

Using . as decimal seperator and , as thousand seperator (or vice versa) makes for very bad readability.
Is clear in any font and even in bad printouts.

The New Currency Act of 1871 did away with these and established the yen, which was defined as 1.5 g (0.048 troy ounces) of gold, or 24.26 g (0.780 troy ounces) of silver, as the new decimal currency.

Well there are actually more than  10'000 bitcoin selling points in Switzerland. (800 is the number of locations. Some train stations have 30+ vending machines)

No seriously think about it.
Let’s assume bitcoin would rise to be worth 100’000’000 USD.
That would make the smallest possible amount you could pay (1 satoshi) worth 1 USD.
At this point you could no longer use bitcoin for amounts smaller than 1 USD.
(The community can always implement a rule change to increase the precision, but I am talking about the decision of satoshi to have the initial precision of 8 decimal places)
I don’t think this was coincidence.

Isn't that the whole point that p2sh and legacy addresses are compatible. 
So a transaction from / to p2sh can be processed as legacy or segwit?
