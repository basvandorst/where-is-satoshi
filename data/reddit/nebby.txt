people might not be visiting Facebook the website but this has nothing to do with Facebook the platform. Facebook the platform is here to stay. Facebook is evolving into a utility. As soon as another similar platform starts to gain traction they will buy it and absorb it into the borg.

No. The "social networking wars" happened in the 2000's and are now over. Facebook won. They now have all the money and the leverage and will buy any potential competitor before that competitor has a chance to jeopardize their position.

A social network... FOR PETS!

so what you're saying is "that's nice and all but I think you are wrong."
good luck sir you are going to need it. there are such a thing as genuinely bad ideas, and these ideas are ones other people who are more talented than you have tried and failed many times over and not due to a lack of execution but due to a flawed idea. Diaspora and the other corpses of the "Facebook but not evil" product thesis should be enough for you to come up with a better idea for a viable business.

Seriously though, this is one of those ideas that everyone has and lots of people say is a "good idea" but like the pet social network it is a complete disaster because the market has shown no, in fact, nobody gives a shit about privacy if it means they won't get to play Farmville or whatever, just like nobody really cares that their dog doesn't have a place on the Internet to connect with their friends.
Don't waste your time or money. If you really want to do something like this, learn to code and fail the hard way don't bring some poor naive programmer into it to fail with you (and destroy your reputation in the process.)
