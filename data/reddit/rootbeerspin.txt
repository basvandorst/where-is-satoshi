this is dumbest comparison and post. I saw interview live yesterday. Just because someone has flip phone does that mean he has no clue. He is actually top Apple investor (10% of his portfolio) just likes things simple. He lives in same house he grew up. Will give away his fortune when die. Look at his website  it looks like 1992.

I saw the yesterday morning interview with Buffett and Charlie Munger and both are saying it will end badly. Both also added they have no interest to buy or short. Simply refuse to understand because they don't need to.  Buffet also added that asset that could easily decline 40-50% there is something wrong and you should be careful. Munger also added venture capital is also in a bubble and Bitcoin.

And Ferrari said fuck off to Lamborghini. He owned several Ferraris and he had issue with one of them and took it to Ferrari and Enzo said no dude you are wrong. It's a Ferrari nothing is wrong. Lamborghini said watch I'm going to create my own company and kick your ass and he did. I like both cars. Fiat did same to Ferrari when he was trying to get a job young ambitious and broke. And he started Ferrari. Now Fiat owns Ferrari.

@_date: 2017-12-21 18:17:35
someone is betting will hit above 50K end of 2018. This guy must have ton of disposable income to bet this. 1M is probably 100K for him.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:06:45

@_date: 2017-12-12 00:56:27
I saw that actually. The both argument were really stupid. He actually was wrong on at least 3 companies that I owned in last 3 years. Completely wrong. And they have almost tripled or more even with pull back and correction/rotations. He wants to make money and he has the best poker face. He was wrong on the GBTC (bitcoin fund). I own some GBTC he called out that funds big time during 500-800s when premiums were 70-90% it went down. This was when no one was talking about Bitcoin and the fund. Fuck this guy.

If you ever home or at work just log on to CNBC and just watch. I can't believe this is business news? First of all NO on has clue what the fuck is going on with Bitcoin or anything in general. Maybe few. They invite guest so call "experts" they have no fucking  clue. Bubble blah blah. Blockchain is good. Bitcoin is just bubble but we like the blockchain. Smart ass comments and next guy.  "People are taking out mortgages to buy bitcoin, says securities regulator" are you fucking kidding this stuff is out of context they put on their headline. It makes no sense.

@_date: 2018-06-29 12:19:56
Also that e class here in US is around 55-60k and will go down half in price in year or two. You can lease well equipped that under $380s. For 36 month 15k annual miles (if negotiation done right with finance manager). You will loose money if you buy the car vs leasing and you can always purchase after lease terms ends. 
Usually get better deal if you work with dealer after lease ends.

First we need to flush out folks who bought on FOMO. Let them sell and longs will buy those coins and are buying. I bought some more last night. I feel we will continue to see the sell off as weak who are on red will take loss. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:07:57
So its clear who bought in high 10k-18K already sold and took loss and are now full on negative toward Bitcoin. These people are who heard friend was buying or their weekend Uber driver was asking about Bitcoin. Fear or missing out on the action. They bought in and thinking it will go easily 20K-25K thanks to some random guy on CNBC said it will go 50K. Without doing any reading or study most went by the news and forums and 
So this was serious shakeout and it took out millions of people. I feel this will go on till 4K or lower. We are not done here. 
I'm holding Bitcoins here since 1200-3000.

Test your recovery process. If you have a hardware wallet (and you should) send a small amount of crypto to it then wipe it and reload it using your seed. This made me much more confident using the wallet once I had done this and knew that recovery was pretty simple. Also use a passphrase, but make sure it is one you will never forget.
I'm getting my Trezor tomorrow and I want to do that. I'm little scared.

When all they talk about is   how the price has gone up and oh the "fucking bubble." CME will have some hiccups, and Bitcoin is new, and it will crash. I'm ready to take the hit for greater reward.

In stock market we have pennystocks pump and dump companies (in millions or less mkt caps), tech, biotech etc. SEC knows that but thanks to loopholes in the system companies can manipulate and scam investors by splitting or promoting(dumb folks who think 2 cent stock will be $1 one day). Same is happening in cryptocurrency world. We now have over 2000 coins. I'm sure there are few projects that is actually making a difference using blockchain.

this is from WSJ today's paper:
Futures on the shiny metal have fallen 9.8% from their highest level of the year at the end of January, and they're down 1.7% this month alone. Gold hit a 52-week low on Thursday, underscoring the hapless state of gold investing at the moment.
What's more, as gold has fallen, investors have ramped up bearish bets. Open interest in gold futures has been rising fast recently, according to Sundial Capital Research's Jason Goepfert. "This suggests that short sellers are pressing their bets," he wrote in a note to clients last week. Typically the opposite happens when gold prices are bottoming out.
Gold is often associated with fearful investors whose distrust for the financial system leads them to store value in physical assets like the metal. But the recent decline is tied more closely to moves in other markets than anything else.
A rise in the U.S. dollar has been a key catalyst. Like many commodities, gold tends to get hit when the greenback is up because it becomes more expensive for overseas investors to buy the asset, which is priced in the U.S. currency.
Additionally, gold tends to fall when inflation-adjusted rates are rising, as they generally have this year. When so-called real rates are up, interest-bearing assets look more attractive than gold, which doesn't offer any income.
Consumer prices picked up at their highest annual rate in more than six years, Labor Department data showed on July 12. But the climb in inflation has been outmatched by rising nominal rates, a factor pushing real yields higher.
Gold could of course rebound, if the recent dollar rally reverses or real rates fall. Prices climbed Friday with the dollar sliding. Plus, a trade war or other unforeseen event could drive a selloff in risky markets, prompting demand for the safety of gold.
But for the moment, the outlook for gold prices is looking a bit tarnished.
