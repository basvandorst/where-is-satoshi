This cunt is all talk. Bitcoin won't be banned. The stupid cunt can barely hold a government together let alone organise a vote on something like this. Besides when her rich Tory doners realise how much money is to be made in crypto she will be informed by them not to ban it. Great idea dumb bitch, ban blockchain and still want to attract new business from abroad after Brexit. Fuck I hate her.

If it's unexpected and contrary to usual expectation it's ironic. I would agree though that the circumstances of the drop doesn't make this ironic. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:38:16
Oh really? I just transferred a few euro to them from my bank account as per instructions. Should be straightforward to verify.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:14:54
Thanks for proving my point kid. You talk like a 13 year old.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:16:44
Excellent. Love education and rationality. Citing sources everywhere OP. Take my upvote.

Or it's to Bitcoin what silver is to gold.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:48:41
Congratulations OP, you are a terrific human being. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:11:15
Dumb comparison. You are converting back to $ by selling one stock for another. You aren't with crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:05:01
More like $20
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:52:48
You're blind.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:41:22
Anyone in the UK got experience with HMRC on CGT and if applicable any other taxes on BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:40:40
That's because BTC is slow though not due to lack of demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:01:56
What the fuck are you talking about? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:31:25
Need it to plummet more, got more to add... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:56:05
Don't the majority just store their coins on coinbase without bothering with wallets? Assuming you keep your password etc secure surely that's incredible safe?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:17:23
You could still be one. Just buy 2 or 3 Bitcoin. It could reach a million by 2022.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:30:44
Yeah my friend said the exact same thing. I had to explain how he isn't really the owner of Bitcoin but fell on deaf ears. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:00:49
Its done for. 284k unconfirmed transactions and rising. Long waiting times. It can't compete. People have realised this. How do you feel OP?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:02:01
Why do people transfer all BTC in one go for things like this? Surely do it bit by bit, maybe 20% each time. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:38:29
Night before last I dreamt it 'dipped' to 5k. Last night I dreamt it crashed to 500 bucks. I still bought more in the dream to hodl.
Safe to say that was more a nightmare than a dream.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:08:13
If Bitcoin reaches 1 million I will be a very, very happy man.
If it ever makes it to 2, or 3 million or more... well, I wouldn't know what to say. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:37:12
Try 19k friend 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:29:12
Hopefully it crashes to 1k. I can load up bigly and then ride to the moon once the lightning network kicks in next year. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:58
What a stupid fucking comparison. Houses have their own tax. In the UK that's SDLT.
Anyway, I've had my answer. The answer is trading one crypto for another doesn't invoke a tax. Now go away.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:31:01
Just verify your bank account. I had mine sent back from my GBP wallet to my account with ease. They just convert it to Euro then your bank charges a few percent to convert it back to GBP.

You don't even know what left wing is. Good job calling Bush left wing too.

Well I have no BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:58:49
Newbie question - how does it work when there is a fork with Coinbase? Do profits get duplicated for a while until it remerges, but you obviously can't withdraw anything that would improve your RoI if there was only one?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:09:19
This shit show is forcing all cryptos to dip.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:24:39
He didn't say that. Read his post again.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:00:11
Maybe don't treat politics like sports. People die from it.

@_date: 2017-12-02 22:36:45
Huh? That doesn't make sense. If I buy a 1 Bitcoin today that doesn't lower the price.

@_date: 2017-12-12 12:57:56
I feel you brother. I'll be happy with just half a coin, which I think is possible. I sort of hope for a huge dip so I can get a whole coin, but eh.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:17:02
Welp, was holding off adding due to the dip for a lower price but guess it's the time to add after all

@_date: 2017-12-02 20:20:43
What are you comparing it to? This is unprecedented.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:53:20
Yep. Had a couple colleagues ask me for links and explanations on buying. These are smart guys too. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:09:52
Eh, put 1k in and if it does hit a million by 2021 then you've made 100k.
Putting 5k in is no big deal, which would yield half a million. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:04:44
This. Why is everyone ignoring this fact? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:26:18
Bitcoin cash is a scam coin in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:07:43
I think he's saying that he won't spend his BTC, because he's frugal and doesn't spend fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:09:32
I didn't get emails from them and I normally do.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:51:42

Wtf did I just play? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:39:15
I wonder if Wall St and other big players are orchastrating all of this? Seems like a remarkable level of manipulation in order to short the entire crypto market. This is what happens when shit isn't regulated.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:34:49
Knees weak 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:40:48
Haha rekt
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:52:22
Adding now seems obvious. People expect a dip of 5k. Not gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:39:57
80k by Christmas. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:21:48
Yes (UK). It's nothing when thinking about what BTC will be worth in 5 years.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:34:32
Interesting. I've read 1 million in no way would imply a global loss in trust of fiat currencies, rather just a full trust in BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:14:13
I remember hearing about it multiple times online from various people circa 2012, thought it was just a scam. What a fool I was. Hindsight is a wonderful thing though.
What's more annoying is not buying a full bitcoin when it like $5k some months ago. Again though, hindsight. Not rich enough now to buy one. :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:14:00
Only lightning can save it..
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:11:56
Nice crystal ball bro, where did you buy it? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:45:47
Given that actual football has been around far longer and is played by far more people and is globally the bigger sport and most played sport that is a pretty dumb comparison to liken it to BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:57:07
Why would they tax going from one crypto to another? I can't imagine anyone would declare this unless transferring back to $ midway.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:42:17
Fuck Ver.

Lol so many people with coin in coinbase vault having to wait 48 hours before they can sell.
8k by christmas morning.

How much are fees? Haven't sent any myself.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:08:07
Both are 65%?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:32:19
What about finding a way to sell it though? The problem is not the fees upon moving, but the fees upon selling to your local fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:34:49
Only if it's their fault though, apparently.

@_date: 2017-12-10 00:59:46
I remember reading at the last dip a post from some guy on here who said he was in tears because he sold at a huge loss then watched it bounce back. Fool. So many weak hands who have no idea about hodl or long term investing. They think it's just constant green everyday. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:07:16
Cry me a god damn river. You don't have to tell everyone about your wealth. You can live a normal happy live, maybe stop shouting about your wealth to everyone then you don't have to worry about gold diggers etc.

You're a patronising asshole. Offer something of real input would you? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:34:22
I put in a big chunk yesterday and am a bit concerned by coinbase adding bcash. Seems now it could go either way but one will come out on top.
