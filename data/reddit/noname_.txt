Call me old fashioned but in my world a "library" or "open-source library", without any further disambiguation, implies C. 
A C library can be utilized by almost any programming language in existence. Especially one that runs on a server. A node.js library (like this) on the other hand is only ever relevant to people using node.js.
I really think the title should read something like "...Bitcore, an open-source node.js library...".

node.js is server side software and does not run in a browser, dumbass.

Yeah, the title seemed very condescending. Especially coming from a guy who's paying 1000x more per bitcoin than the "amateurs" did.

If you don't plan on trading your coins in the immediate future, *never* store them in an exchange or some other kind of online service. They get hacked *all the time*.
This is not some theoretical "best practice" thing that people bitch about online. It's an actual, real threat to your money.
Just look at poloniex, coinex, bitstamp and of course mtgox. Those are just a couple of examples of services that we *know* have lost coins. Others might as well just continue to operate on a fraction of the coins without being solvent, as if nothing happened.
Use official, open source wallets with encrypted wallet.dat and make backups of it (on your own physical media, not in the cloud). It's not perfectly safe, but it's a lot safer.

Thanks, fixed.

Speaking of which, I just realized that you don't need a bank to practice fractional reserve. The online wallet services could easily do it too.
I don't see anything stopping eg. blockchain.info to simply take, say, 50% (or even more) of all the bitcoins in the wallets they manage.
No-one would ever notice.

I think the point is that it's impossible to do any risk/reward analysis when the manufacturers are delaying their product for months on end. An X Mh/s miner might be worth its price in January, whereas in August it won't nearly make ROI.
Not only don't you have anything mining in the meantime, you've already paid for the equipment so you don't make anything from BTC price going up.
So yeah, I would fault certain manufacturers for being extremely optimistic with their delivery times. Perhaps even straight out lying in some cases.

Are you planning to keep it as BTC or are you going to trade it for a conventional currency, or perhaps gold?
