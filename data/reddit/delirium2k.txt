You are arguing that because government created the internet that is the only way it could ever have happened.  That is a blatantly illogical argument and it is also untestable.  My argument is logical, and while we obviously can't go back in time to test it, the fact that it is logical automatically gives it more weight.
Of course, there is little point in arguing with someone who assumes violence is the best method to solve social problems.  However, I'm sure you aren't even consistent in the application of your solutions because you probably don't go around teaching children to rob and murder anyone that wants to live differently than they do.  You don't even have the courage of your convictions to be consistent with their application.

What counterfactual am I arguing?  Also, do you teach children that stealing is an acceptable way to get what they desire?

And yet you took the time to respond, proving that you do in fact argue with my type, regardless of your imagined excuse not to.  It is not an unproven hypothesis that more than one person can have the same idea.  There are many examples throughout history of people coming up with similar ideas without having communicated with each other to do so.  To suggest that ideas are somehow unique to one single individual on the planet is absurd to the nth degree.  My pointing out that you would rather use violence than logic is not an insult.  It is a verifiable fact that can easily be gleaned from your insistence that others be robbed at gunpoint to fund things that you desire.

So your argument goes as such.
I don't do X.  I am on the metro.  Therefore, I will do X.  See how bad your logic is?

You act as if the internet could never have been built without the government.  That's a logical fallacy.  Don't worry though, you don't have to argue using proper logic. Statists don't need logic, they have violence on their side.

You could dispute the logic of my arguments.  Oh wait, no you couldn't, because you completely lack any grasp of how logical arguments work.
