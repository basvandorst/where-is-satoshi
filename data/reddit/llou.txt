MtGox is already covered in the actual legislation as only banks can do partial reserve banking. MtGox simply scammed its customers and can be prosecuted.
The only thing it should appear in legal text is what kind of asset, property, digial document is bitcoin so judges can apply existing legislation.
They shouldn't try to legislate the network mainly because two reasons:
  - they cannot.
  - there is no need, the network is fair and the rules are clear. 
The bitcoin network is a game where every body agrees that there are some rules there is no juridic person behind it so there is nothing to regulate about it.

What I don't understand is why they sell if they won't be able to buy later. WTF?!

If it is used in free countries it will always have a value, and meanwhile it has value it can be used for payments in non free countries, and payments outside the control of the dictatorial power.

I would say trust is capital. You can exchange it for money even you can buy it.

Why just simply the bitcoin protocol prize the other closests solutions to solve the block as well as the final one, so there is no need for the pool nightmare.
Spreading the bounty between 10 or even more like 100 miners that submit their solutions to the winner that certifies the solution might solve this annoyance.

No way, If you are planning to do so market rules are clear in this point if a product is harder to buy it is more expensive (a restriction in the supply increases prize). Products in the black market are always more expensive that those sold in groceries shops.
It is still time to buy and keep.

He gets very messy when they ask him what to regulate about bitcoin.
In my humble opinion what he should tell them is that bitcoin is no different of other personal software and the law should guarantee the right of privacy and provide how and when the authorities should overcome this right for the public good.
Bitcoin is a protocol like http for example and there's no regulation, as far as I know about about it because the organization behind it already regulates it and it only allows exchange of information and as this is the right of free speech there is nothing to cut here for the lawmakers. It would be like if they regulate printing presses.

Bitcoin is the original project and the leading one, altcoins are there to experiment with new features or focus on other perspective, some of them although are a scam, it is necessary to exist an ecosystem to take the torch if the leading project fails for any reason.

Every crypto-currency has its strengths and its weakness, it is important that all of them have the chance to flourish because humanity needs a decentralized financial system.
Litecoin is a great project driven by a good team and they have their reasons to do what they do. Let time tell who is right and who is wrong.
What I see here is people that is very strong in bitcoins and don't want competence like bankers don't want bitcoin. The same illness grows when money piles up, greed.

Please stop calling them bubbles those are rallies, bubbles last longer and when they pop the psychological effect that drives the value up disappears like a bubble.
Rallies on the other side are caused by over buying due to a constant increase of value that attracts speculative capital, when the price goes to far from fundamentals the main actors stop buying until the price goes to its right equilibrium price.

I you are a freshman a compliment, as the style shows maturity. If not and you are a community manager trying to convince people to sell bitcoins shows incompetence.

They can use external servers for this stuff.

You forget something about the economy, bitcoin it is also a great long term investment product, risky but which is giving returns that outperforms the rivals, and this is I think the force that is driving prices up as It freezes many coins out of the market.
So don't focus only in its use as payment method, that is growing at a slower pace because technology is hard to deploy, but remember also the fact that it is mostly guaranteed to grow at an exponential rate what makes it a very interesting asset to hold.

Just to point out that governments and banks understands bitcoin perfectly and the power it has to undermine their power.

In the programming subculture of open source movement hacker is meant for people who solves creatively a problem and a hack the way it solves the problem. 
From this point of view, bitcoin it is undoubtedly a hack to the financial system, and Satoshi a hacker. I understand that people outside this environment find it pejorative as media uses the term in reference to bad hackers (black hat ones), but I think it is important to make the general public understand the meaning of hacker as smart programmer.

Greenbacks are doing fine just because the huge amounts of money that were printed to save the financial system stayed among big companies, governments and very rich people. This inflated investment products like stocks and bonds making look their markets in a far better shape than they really are.
