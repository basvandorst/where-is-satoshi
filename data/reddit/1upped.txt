I checked blockchain.info and my bitcoins were sent, but I still can't find them in my coin wallet. What do I do? Do I need to specifically download or request to bring my Bitcoins into my wallet?

I appreciate it! My client has been synching for the last 12 or so hours...though it is actually working even if extremely slowly. It's at 92% now, I left it last night at 85% when I went to bed, it must be getting slower the closer it gets to completion. You think another day or two until it's fully done?

I use a wallet on my computer to store, though these BTC should not be in storage for more than a couple days. I intend to spend them. What are the advantages of Dwolla over a direct wire transfer to Mt.gox?

100$ limit there, stated in their FAQ. I created an account and linked it to my bank before I saw this.

Yeah, and they make it actually (to someone with novice tech knowledge) impossible to see from their website what the fees are. These banks are disgusting in their conduct and the way they levy fees. Someone needs to fucking regulate them.

Darn. Just too late for me, need them in the next two weeks.

That's true, it just seems like a lot in comparison to the small amounts I've seen usually talked about. Would it be crazy to make a 2 or 3 Bitcopia deposits?

At the moment I think convenience is most important because I need it in the next two weeks, but in the future cost will definitely be more important. I think for my first large purchase I'll go through Mt.gox, but I'd definitely like to do a nominal amount with you to test it out first (&lt;5btc) and then go from there if it works out nicely.

I am in the US, and I have all options available though I would feel more comfortable buying through an established source and not locally, I don't really know enough to ensure I don't get scammed. From what I'm reading, it seems like I might want to fund my Mt.gox account by wire transfer and then make a several smaller purchases of ~20BTC over the course of a week. Does that make sense?

Sounds good to me then. I'll probably just bite it and wire the money to Mt.gox this time, still pretty cheap compared with bitcopia, bitinstant and aurumxchange I assume. I just made a Dwolla account and will use that in the future.

I'd be interested in that but don't know much about escrow services outside of silk road. How much money would I stand to save over Mt.gox? 
@_date: 2013-02-06 02:20:40
in the US, USD, don't care how I pay. I assume wire transfer is usually cheapest.

What do you mean by take a backup?
