Miners are going to become a lot less relevant in the near future.

No hacker is sitting on the ability to "harvest" those private keys for years. Just start with small amounts until you get more comfortable.

Donated, glad I can help such a great site with bitcoin!

Voters are sent an email with a few form questions, btc address, email address and answer to election. It all goes on a spreadsheet and votes can be verified using a block explorer.
@_date: 2015-05-27 04:15:28
Yes, you can do it anonymously. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 12:14:59
New business idea, Virgin old. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:33:40
Well first of all voters don't have any incentive to screw with the process. But I understand everything needs to be thought through. The voters are asked for their btc address and their answer. So I know which btc address represents you because you submit that. If that btc address submitted sends btc to multiple options it would go to the one that is time stamped first by the block chain. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:02:07
The first one that is time stamped by the blockchain. Each voter is connected to a btc address.

I picked it to smooth out the chart and avoid the boom/bust periods.
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:39:25
Only the email addresses that receive the invite for that election can enter info that will go directly onto the spreadsheet. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 23:31:53
Who owned it?

I used the chart on coindesk's site, using coinbase exchange and it shows $430 as last 2015 and $430 first of 2016. Sorry if this isn't accurate. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:32:48
Nice work, I'll be looking into this.
@_date: 2016-01-01 06:53:13
Congrats goodbtc and Happy New Year! You came the closest to the price - $430. here is $7 in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 07:23:36

Happy New Year everyone, 2016 is going to be a great year for bitcoin.

Here's an example - 7 people on a corporate board need to vote for a new chairman. One of the members starts the election by filling out the questions. Then the invitations get sent to the email addresses. Only one vote can be sent from each invitation. So the seven votes come in and the info gets posted directly to a spreadsheet. All participants can see is each voters btc address and their answer, but not their identity. And the election organizer can be anonymous or not. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the video James says it's better that you can't prove your vote, if you can't prove it's not easy to sell it. He also talks about someone intimating a voter. Yes, these things could happen with my system, but it's not likely. And if you can't prove it then you can't know for sure if your vote was counted. In my system you could prove or not, it's your option. You can find some pros and cons with some of these issues. I like the pros of secure, transparent, electronic, anonymous or public.

1 bitcoin will always = 1 bitcoin.

Just watched the Beacon Theater video. Great show, $5 worth of bitcoin. Keep it going Louie, spread the word. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 02:09:00
Better get your resume tuned up, just in case. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 18:56:05
[suggestion] If you don't understand the ramifications of the     options, you don't need to throw your two cents in. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 23:20:09
And that's why it's going to spread. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 04:48:36
I like the idea and the site, nice work! I'll give it a try this weekend.
@_date: 2015-03-15 01:32:41
Sent tip, she's doing a great job.
