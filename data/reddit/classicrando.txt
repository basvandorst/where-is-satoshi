I am assuming Apple will create a multi-merchant/multi payment vendor iWallet app probably associated with passbook and your iTunes account.  Why would it not be the same as GoogleWallet/NFC?       
    


    
I assume for iWallet, it would be similar to the iTunes requirements but with additional checks, so you are less likely to have fraudulent squating because Apple will be retaining tight control of access to iWallet/passbook "linking" of vendor locations to the vendor profile that would pop up on your iWallet.      
    


     
Almost everything on the internet including the bitcoin ecosystem has massive security holes, as I have repeated said, security issues/concerns have zero to do with adoption rates.
I guess we will see tomorrow, maybe it will be NFC and BLE or NFC only, who knows - but a cynic could abstract out to a level where they would describe both NFC and BLE as "a nifty way to launch the relevant merchant's app in order to pay."      
   
All that matters short term is how people perceive it - if they perceive BLE based systems as easier, it will take off even if they need a per merchant app. Most people buy from the same 5-10 places for years on end anyway. No one cares about security or people would be behaving much differently than they do.

In a null context, all the things you said seem perfectly reasonable. But the level hero worship and hivemindedness with bitcoin shows off some of the worst attibutes of group dynamics. When listening to something Newt Gingrich says, I think it is important to know he was cheating on his wife while publicly crucifying Clinton for the same thing, in the same way I think it is important that the past statements of the core devs are known and give a more full context to their current and future statements.       
       
For example, I think Gavin said that government cooperation would be required for bitcoin to grow -  but that is lost down the memory hole now.

Also, I could see creating a dedicated my-corp coin system that could be used if  several players had relationships where value moved in both directions and needed to be tracked but not necessaarily exported out to fiat or consumed in a given location.

I don't want the devs to be anything specific. If they made decisions in the past that seemed contrary to the greater good (in the view of good project stewardship principles and the wants of the community) I don't want that to be forgotten. If Gavin is gushing about robustness of multiple software genomes being an important part of the bitcoin ecosystem's future, I expect him to own up and say "I was wrong about this before, but I now see the light thanks to a push from blah". That is a sign of a mature and thoughtful person in a position where I (and presumably others) want to see those attributes and would engender trust.         
     
I don't care one way or the other about the govt stuff, but I do care that many people new to bitcoin think that Gavin is (and was) of a similar mind to them regarding govt/bitcoin interactions.

This is fruitless, cjdns is not magic and won't solve huge classes of problems related to internetworking. Most certainly, it would not solve the generalized example of a chat system better than the "servers in Mountain View" system.   A connected graph is not a "bus" just because it is not a full equal node-weight mesh. backbone and bus don't mean the same thing just because you want to use them interchangably. You can't run the current internet on a mesh without creating some backbone-a-like system. You can run an extremely limited, unreliable, prone-to-partitioning, low bps, geographically localized system without a backbone, yes but something bigger or better without specialized equipment, no.

It has nothing to do with past/future until something changes that we can't even imagine yet. "4G" in the US or Africa still uses wires, big fat wires that you couldn't drop a "meshnet" in to replace them. Just because they are a 1/2 mile or so away rather that 100 feet away doesn't change what the OP said copper/fiber it is the same.

Not toothless soon enough though, they poison the well of any services (anywhere that the US has influence over the local governments not just NY state) that want to do anything new/innovative because it gives authorities license to say "You might have some NY residents as customers and you have not conformed to our laws, so our friends at 'your local LE orgs' will stop by and pick up your servers, docs, people, assets, kthxbai".      
    
As has been pointed out - bitcoin is not built for micro-transactions (tips, etc) and to do those well, you have to at least temporarily hold some balances for people involved. There are lots of interesting ideas that may involve holding balances or somehow otherwise violating the proposed regs - supposedly even issuing a digital currency violates the regs.

It is not a red herring if you have 500 million accounts in your store system and those accounts have a proven track record of being willing to use that system to spend billions per year.  Now they are attaching a brick and mortar payment system, I guess people can pretend it won't be big or only brainwashed idiots will use it but my guess is it will surpass google wallet volume in less than 18 months and have above-linear growth curve for the first 4 years.

This is not the case, if you do all of the encryption of the pw on the client, then someone only needs to steal the hashed/encrypted string and then they can access your account. The "current best practices" are to use scrypt or similar with a site-wide salt, an individual "pepper" and then encrypt the username and the pw together so 
scrypt (salt+pepper+username+pw)      
You don't want to do all that on the client side. There are "zero knowledge" systems that can do things differently SRP from Stanford is one and it is supposedly built into the recent versions of openssl but idk if anyone uses it yet. There were some patent questions that de-railed it after it first came out, afaicr.        
     


      
Not really, bitcoin signed messages and transactions are a different kind of crypto process, pulbic key encryption, one way functions, etc.   
Statistically speaking, the likelyhood that someone can guess your private key is slightly less likely than them being god.      


     
Most wallets, websites and clients use different addresses for the change for security and for historical reasons. People have lost their btc due to mistakes when 'manually' using single private keys.        
      
Unless you are a mogul with tons of btc, I would say just use electrum or mycelium and you should be ok.

Right, but this is different afaik, it will be built into the OS/passbook system. So bitcoin apps are allowed and any app can interact/read BLE beacons on any iPhone 4S and up but they probably won't have the same level of access that the Apple iWallet will have. But maybe they will create a lib that has hooks, it will be interesting to see.     
     
My guess is that this new system will create a higher barrier psychologically for people with iOS device relative to bitcoin since they will say - I can do 99% of the bitcoin payment stuff with iWallet (and the bitcoin fan will explain a bunch of other revolutionary uses for bitcoin that the iOS device user will not consider relevant to them until/unless there is a major societal change "ie the highly anticipated 'failure of the US dollar'")

They are, the OP posted a "4) Profit!" scenario, maidsafe and that crap won't replace the internet backbone because they require the internet to work.      
    
Firechat uses bluetooth right now, the bluetooth lib on android is worse than the one on iPhone (that is from a real developer who used them for real work). BLE is too new and mostly on iPhones currently all bluetooths old and new built in to phone are not built to support a number of connections as you would see on a denser mesh network. wifi chip and libs on devices have similar problems - they are not made to be APs, they are made to be clients.

The more important part over and above the fact that it creates high barriers to startups wanting to enter the market (as the other comments mention), it takes a giant pillow and quietly smothers any innovative uses for bitcoin outside of the ones that already exist in the conventional banking/finance systems by creating huge barriers for _customers_ and independent developers (under the proposed law changetip is illegal unless they start doing KYC/AML). So if you can't hold bitcoin for people to be able to do interesting new things without be branded a bank/money transfer business then you kill many new uses in any jurisdiction that NY/US has influence.     
     
Let's say a magic fairy (named Beldar) comes and gives all the cool bitcoin startups enough money to comply with all the laws, who will want to go through all the hassle of setting up accounts, verifying documents, etc - oh, yeah the same people who already do it with banks and paypal and whoever - wow, suddenly those cool, agile startups are old, stodgy, slow moving dinos, chocked full of lawyers nixing every interesting new idea because it may require more infrastructure than is worth the projected revenue - same as their banking bros.

With iBeacons (BLE beacons) and this new wallet thing, Apple is going to become the major force in mobile payments in one fell swoop. And afterwards, people will rage on about how there were BLE and NFC and online payment systems before and apple never invented any of it !!!        
Meanwhile, dump trucks full of money will be filling the coffers at Apple - all because "idiots" want to use beautiful, easy modern stuff and get on with their lives and Apple gives them that. 
     
Apple bashing indicates a disconnect with how "regular middle/upper middle class, people" see electronics/devices/technology vs the people who feel the need to bash Apple. People should heed the history lesson in the slashdot discussion of the iPod and realize that there is a pattern and like it or not, Apple changes the landscape of the markets it enters.

I don't remember if it was him, but there was discussion on bitcointalk when the first alternative server implementation was being discussed (bitcoinj ?) and at least 2 core developers argued vigorously against alternative implementations and even a test suite [edit: I believe they were arguing against a spec, not specifically a test suite (I think Gavin(?) mentioned working on some tests) - but I believe the alt server dev wanted to create a spec then a test suite].

My guess is slightly less open than normal iTunes store vendor access. Yeah, "entirely uninteresting" but possibly the largest mobile payment system by $ volume in a couple years - which is where I started, BLE is going to be huge and one of the huge aspects of BLE will be payment related (without NFC).     


     
You're not thinking like a regular middle class person, those are all "a hassle" compared to BLE.    
      


    
The history of commerce has proven that no one really cares (except us and the history of software development/IT proves that no one listens to us regardless of bulletproof reasoning), why do you keep bringing up security if we are talking about adoption? If security was a priority for most people, then presumably bitcoin adoption would be higher than it is, right? Or changes to the CA system or pervasive use of client side certs or encrypted email or multi-billion companies proactively auditing/funding the security related software that they rely on for revenue - no one cares until after major disasters and even then it is marginal and fleeting.


    
But it removes one of the big "wins" of BLE only systems - no waiting in a checkout line (when combined with RFID readers or other ways of verifying what you are buying).

Well, I and the history of network based software would politely disagree with Satoshi - smtp, dns, tcp/ip xmpp, etc have all benefited from multiple server/client implmentations despite the risk.    
And Gavin supposedly agrees with the idea, and looking at some of the bitcoin protocol related discussions he has for sometime. So it was other devs that were more against it. gmaxwell? others I can't remember who but I remember the tone.

First you said it wouldn't happen due to security problems, then I point to articles showing BLE is being used for payment systems already. Now you are saying that if people ignore your security concerns that is their problem. I already addressed that - no one cares about your security concerns. Are you trying to stand by your implied assertion that BLE payments won't out pace NFC payments in the US in 18 months? Or are you saying only "idiots" will be using BLE payment systems?

Botnets are now trying to use different ways to do "C&amp;C" command and control - the bots have to go somewhere to get orders, recently some bots have used yahoo mail rather than IRC since the good guys are not searching for yahoo mail connections going out from their networks (it would be like driving a silver prius in SF, no one would notice you) and might miss that, similarly traffic to reddit would not be noticed from a network vs IRC or other unusual traffic/ports/protocols.

A VPS or Private server is not what you'd buy when you are pushing 500Mbps - 5 Gbps of traffic. They wouldn't let you do 500 Mbps on a VPS or if they did, it would cost more than several full racks. power and bandwidth  You buy full racks or "cages" and put in all your own equipment and connect via fiber to the Hetzner network.

I didn't contradict myself, they were secret.

Later they were caught and then admitted it after they got caught. Same with Enron - most of their secret entities were found.

There was an old overlay network (mesh-ish) that did address assignment but it used a central authority to assign IPv6 addresses (there was not a good way to do distributed network assignment back then). It was pretty decent for its time, I wish I could remember the name...        
       
I have been excited about ad-hoc/mesh networking for different levels of the internet for a long time, I think it is important but I find the religious exuberance a bit over the top, but this is so I should take it with a grain of salt.

I am not sure what you are talking about. No one in the world sells a "server" for 99 euros that can push that much traffic. I would want some proof beyond some guy on twitter.   
     
Edit: I don't know if you understand hosting and colocation pricing. Here is the server list with the included bandwidth ( 30 TB/ month or 91 Mbps):       
      
      
       
       
So that is a max of 30 TB of traffic "free" - not bad, but nowhere near the multi PBs  of traffic that that node _would have used_ if it was running at that speed for a full month. If you were to really pushing that much traffic, generally most data center/colo/hosting companies will have much lower pricing for higher bandwidth levels for people buying full racks and/or cages than they have for people buying single VPS or dedicated servers.        
      
Edit 2:  The node seems to be gone now and the fastest node is 35,000 KBps (208 Mbps) [in Paris?] or so right now. Maybe they burnt through their free 30 TB and shut it down.

And what is the ratio of credit card (or gift card) use via the respective store systems? Even if Android usage was 99% of the 'smartphone' market, it is not relevant to who is spending money via the smartphone and/or it's respective store.       
     
     


    
A company with a half trillion dollar valuation, easily over 500 million iTunes accounts many with credit card info and a unmatched track record for spending (compared to Android), easily over 500 million devices sold.

Q:   Where to get bitcoin if I don't get paid in bitcoin?        
      
A:  Sell goods for bitcoin.      
    
He is saying so you want me to:     
     
1. Pay fiat for wholesale goods (2 pallet loads of beanie babies)      
2. Sell individual beanie babies for bitcoin     
    
Everyone acts like it is easy to create/provide a service that people will use bitcoin to pay for - that is much harder than trying to buy/obtain bitcoin outright. (And he is saying buying bitcoin is a hassle, too). These things are true I don't know why it is discussed endlessly here as if it is a ding against bitcoin. It is an unavoidable situation for any new payment system/currency; there will always be friction between different systems.     
      
So to recap, daveime is asserting:      
     
fiat -&gt; bitcoin = Level 1 hassle       
fiat -&gt; wholesale goods/materials -&gt; retail sales -&gt; bitcoin = Level 2 hassle     
fiat -&gt; create infrastructure to market and sell a service for bitcoin -&gt; bitcoin  = Level 2+ hassle

Not necessarily. I wouldn't turn on directory serving - it doesn't need to be on every node. There is nothing suspicious about the config other than bitcoin port only traffic.

The whole article is ridiculous, it could be summed up as "Apple Pay is not bitcoin".    
    
And it does not matter if Apple Pay is "another layer of complication" behind the scenes, what matters to real people who will be spending money is that Apple Pay makes life easier/faster for them. Right now, bitcoin is not there yet and in the article the writer doesn't say what hotel he booked in his example but I doubt it was "directly from him to the hotel" and not via some intermediary. The frontier of the American West was amazing and created opportunity and an amazing future for the rest of the continent but it wasn't "easy" and it took people willing to take risks and put in the extra work to pave the way - that is where bitcoin is now, to constantly compare bitcoin to a multi-hundred year old industrial sector that dominates our business and cultural worlds is tiresome when people keep trying to distort reality about the relative use cases for average people and merchants.

I was thinking more , not you, obviously, you try to post thoughtful/useful content and I appreciate that. And when I said naive bystander, I meant naive bystanders viewing our discussion.     
   
And I don't think I view things as black/white. I think that myself and groups I participate in should be aware of and consciously solicit dissent - I try and encourage others to try to create environments like the Shuttle computer project or the 10th man practice from Word War Z .  I even have a saying for startups "if all the 'idea people' always agree on things, we only need one of them". 
So, I guess I am black and white about the idea that good group dynamic response to internal dissent is required for optimal group function and optimal progress to goals.  :)      
      
My strong feelings about this specific topic are strong and I think the results of re-implementation speak for themselves. On other topics within the technical world of bitcoin, I don't necessarily have strong opinions.

Voting won't work in reality.    
    
Two problems -      
1 - votes are micro/nano transactions that the system can't handle volume-wise - hell, miners won't even fill up the current blocks much less the huge blocks that would be required for large voting systems.         
2 - to implement any type of voting you have to tie the voting mechanism to a fraud resistant unique 1-to-1 mapping of digital identity to a human - and no one wants that except people who want to trojan horse a mandatory digital identity system on the populous under the guise of digital voting but google would never do that...

Cool story, bro - but wrong. It was a lengthy drunken discussion about the psychology of holding/selling in times of high volatility.    
   
Most people don't have a way to experience/discuss the psychology of economics/trading in a conscious way, so that alone is a value of bitcoin/cryptocurrencies.

Stuffy econ 101 classes that are completely detached from reality? Who knows, bitcoin might even 'prove' some economic theories about deflationary currencies are not correct when applied to an imperfect live test.

No they won't. Visa et al don't do much in terms of micro transactions and any changes to the limits or protocol will be required to allow bitcoin to just even try to scale to any sizable quantity of tps - just for normal "candybar or coffee" sized transactions or larger much less 1/10 of a cent micro transactions for publications, etc.     
     
Everyone involved in bitcoin from the beginning has said bitcoin is not built for micro transactions - people really need to remove micro transactions from their list of "bitcoin positive attirbutes".   And, yeah, offchain stuff is not bitcoin so it is a completely different discussion.

Apparently, running this node in a non-conventional way really bothers you - try to think about from the POV of someone who doesn't give a damn about the Tor "ecosystem" and just wants to facilitate obfuscating bitcoin traffic and just threw it on the server with minimal configuring, maybe it is configured this way because instead of being overly interested in it, they are _not_ interested in it.

It is a race to the bottom of interacting with the store. What if you can just click a box on your iWallet settings that says "I trust any iWallet vendor"; for you or me, we might never do that. For a busy soccer mom with 3 kids that goes to Starbucks twice a day, Target twice a week, Walgreens every week and Safeway 3 times a week, she will and she'll be plenty happy for Apple to manage the vendor list for her.

Also, I don't know if Apple apparently agrees that NFC is better, it may have been a matter of them being pragmatic about the ecosystem of NFC being available now vs BLE being a thing they just introduced and there is no roll out yet from POS vendors (except for PayPal being high profile about their BLE/POS integration).
@_date: 2014-09-07 04:05:36
BLE beacons can work at longer distances and can be used as an integrated instore and near store advertising and payment system.     
     
   
    
They will make "Minority Report" style advertising systems possible without needing the retinal scanners. Venues will be heavy users of BLE beacons. Museums can create self guided tours, tourist areas can create interactive guides - I thought about designing one for SF.

But when you are asking about adoption, you have to see what normal consumers want and see. Right now, normal consumers see bitcoin as having a high barrier and the "iTunes Store Payment System" as having zero or negative barrier - they use it already. On the merchant side, there is a similar situation, all the POS vendors will rush to integrate the Apple system because merchants will be asking for it because customers will be asking for it in large numbers.     
     
My guess is, yes it will negatively impact areas with significant numbers of iOS users - and what if they decided to create an Android version of the iTunes Wallet? They did Safari on Windows so it is not unpossible.

cellular is a form of wireless between the device and the tower, the tower then has (sometimes several) wires called backhauls. They can be copper or fiber depending on the conditions. So yes, contrary to what people may think cellular networks are only generally wireless for the first portion of the journey that your packet takes through the internet.       
      
Cell based wireless can also use microwave or other other wavelength systems for backhaul in certain conditions (those still connect to wires then).          
       


    
Yes, I know - I said you could not reasonably replace the backhaul for a cell tower with a meshnet (meshnet in current vernacular means wireless)

I am not sure why people can't be more empathetic to businesses - most small ones are hanging by thread and the owners are super busy with a thousand things and most big ones, the decision making authority to say "yes" to anything non-standard is non-existent by design. btc advocates (sometimes) act like bitcoin should be the important thing for a business to focus on _right now_ Minimum wage support line slaves should be able to know how to answer and/or route bitcoin inquiries to where?      
     
It has been this way the whole time, I don't agree with badgering/spamming/pressuring businesses on bitcoin. Yeah, it is chicken and the egg and I don't know how to solve that problem.     
    
Unfortunately, people can't be realistic about the volume of btc transactions that most business get at this point in time. And on the larger issue of group dynamics, there is sadly little self awareness and understand of group psychology. There was recently a post where someone tried to make some very valid points about group processes and they were downvoted into the ground.    
     
A couple years ago someone vehemently insisted I was spreading FUD because I said businesses could not be certain of what the regulatory environment of bitcoin would be in the US since at the time there had not been any clear direction from any US Federal bodies.

Nearly every 256-bit number is a valid private key. Specifically, any 256-bit number between 0x1 and 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4141 is a valid private key. The range of valid private keys is governed by the secp256k1 ECDSA standard used by Bitcoin.      
       
So that is slightly less than the estimated number of atoms in the known universe, so unless we start trading bitcoins with other universes in our multiverse (or heaven forbid, other multiverses), we are probably ok with the current set of address candidates.

You may want to take a stand, and feel that the cost/hassle is worth it.    
Or a case that not many people mention - to try to keep local/small businesses in business, if you take on the burden of whatever fees/friction are required to obtain bitcoin then you can relieve the business from the fees they pay to give people the convenience of paying with a credit card. That 1.5-2% of gross could be the difference between staying in business and closing.

I am familiar with the issues, what I am trying to point out is that this is 180 degrees from the core dev position a couple years ago - where they were openly hostile to 1) a spec, 2) a test suite and 3) alternative server implementations.

I agree, institutional corruption reached a type of peak recently - US govt agencies charged with protecting people (FCC, FDA, VA, etc), financial govt/private systems (baillout, etc), churches (priests and higher ups hiding child molesters and blocking investigations), private businesses (Enron et al), elections being rigged, IranContra, etc. 
    
Well, if an organization that supports the little guy and ideals of the ecosystem can spring up, it will be attacked by many interests and certainly labelled as supporting crime and terrorism. But I think at least some of the people involved in bitcoin want to see transparency in any "institutions" related to bitcoin.         
    
Many people claim that increased transparency correlates well with reduced corruption and transparency advocates claim that corruption increases friction. I don't think an efficient market can exist without very high levels of institutional transparency.    
     
If people want bitcoin and more generally digital currencies to create true societal change, they need the related institutions to be open/transparent - true it is easier to run a closed entity and people will make alot of excuses for _why_ things need to be closed/private but those are just that - excuses.

Yeah I completely _get what you are saying_ and as I said, in general that is possible and to a naive bystander it seems reasonable. But I am saying in this specific case of bitcoin* and at that specific time - prioritizing a spec over some other tasks and not being hostile to people who wanted to do alternate implementations and/or a spec was the right thing to do. But the core-devs have the luxury of having their cake and eating it - people calling for a spec and/or alternate implementations were not treated well and low and behold, the people did not take "go away" for an answer and we got alternate implementations anyway and the bitcoin world is better for it. Nice how that worked out.       
      
Everyone loves to rag on the MPOE guy/girl because he is an abrasive ass but he and others had and have many valid criticisms of the code base and the processes and the decisions and mistakes made by the core devs. But, again as I said, there is too much hero worship and mob-style group dynamics around bitcoin to have logical, rational discussions about the merits of any given facet of the work or the ecosystem.     
     
_* People generally agree that the code base as developed by Satoshi was not a maintenance-friendly, group development friendly, long term thinking type of code base.

2 different types of wireless, so in your case you are talking about an even more powerful "backhaul" system, copper and/or fiber that is slightly further away. wifi used by devices (often whenever they can use wifi over cell even moreso now with iOS 8) suffers the limitation I described.

I didn't miss it, they didn't say "Let's do that later" or something. My point still stands, they didn't want to do it but it is obvious to anyone with a modicum of software development knowledge that a spec should have been as high priority and that a clear testable spec is the way to move a project forward quickly with a little misunderstanding as possible. "The reference code is the spec" is lazy and amateurish, not what you want to build a world changing technology on. And it was not just what they said, but the way it was said.          
           
I am not sure why you are trying to retrospectively white-wash their stance. It was not the right thing for bitcoin at that time, so your theoretical comparisons to Linux are not accurate. The code base was reasonably small, the individual modules/functions were not complex, a spec was appropriate at that time and even before that. It was, as far as I can tell, an ego based decision - "we know best".     
     
Edit: I will add that I notice that the core devs also want it both ways. When there are problems/issues, etc they will argue - "well, bitcoin is an experiment so it might fail and that is ok because it is an experiment". Then when it suits them, they will argue "omg, we can't risk doing X because bitcoin is too valuable".

Slow, expensive, distributed ledger system with an extremely low transaction capacity given the amount of computing power involved - with wildly varying transaction costs and unknown and unpredictable transaction settlement times and the P2P option was removed due to lack of security according to the devs who removed it.     Efforts are and have been afoot to blacklist coins and addresses, as early as the "lighthouse" idea and continuing to blacklisting of addresses by governments. An added benefit of BTC is the extreme friction and scrutiny related to moving value in and out of the system.
