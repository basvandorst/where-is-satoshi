You are wrong, it says very clear in the documentation that only a functionary can process a peg-out. So you need to get one of them to cash you out back to bitcoin.

That's great news! Hopefully they get to know Interledger.

I am just really concerned about multi-party channels, especially when someone tries to maliciously submit an old state, with sub-channels involved.
What does each party have access to claim or steal..

It sounds like you are making this up as you go along? 
Where is the wait time recorded, the normal punishment model has no such wait time for punishing.
Is everyone actually forced to wait when the shit hits the fan and one or more people stop cooperating?

But this scenario expands:
I have to be fearful of every lightning channel created in the multi-party channel that I aren't part of. I would be pushing for on-chain syncing regularly to make sure people there can't ever be the threat of collusion and extortion. 
In fact I'd strongly consider refusing to allow the multi-party channel to proceed if I saw channels by others suggested, and doing so would lockup all of my liquidity in the channel for 1000 blocks. 
All of this game theory decision makes multi-party channels quite unweildy.
If I am actually understanding the system correctly.

I agree, and the results would be that states that involve other people having channels within this factory, always becomes a risk if I ever expect those people to trade with me later on.
This can be mitigated with on-chain checkpointing  or various other things. But I currently see that as a security flaw of multi party channels
@_date: 2019-04-07 11:23:29
A channel factory is what i'm talking about.
It would create one channel on-chain, for the 3 of them.
 But in subsequent states, users can create sub-channels between themselves that exist as normal 2-way multisig LN channels. These sub-channels are instant because they are not on-chain, unless the factory is closed, which would drop them on-chain.

I am used to the standard punishment model of lightning and HTLC's, but from what I've read an heard, stashing your bitcoin in a "channel within a channel" appears to flout this punishment model.

If Alice broadcasts an old state, she does so in a timelocked fashion, giving the others person the ability to beat that timelock using his half commit of THAT SAME STATE  to unlock her funds before she can receive them.
So does Charlie have access to crack open Alice and Bobs channel or not.
Your comment implies, much like the conclusion that Charlie Decker reached.. Bob would be the one with the tools to punish Alice.
@_date: 2019-04-07 11:25:07
Usually, the punishment mechanism in a 2-way LN channel is that if Alice tries to cheat, Charlie can take all the coins. 
My suggestion here is that she can trap her opening balance in a channel with Bob, so that Charlie does not have the opportunity to steal that balance.

I feel like they might just use a spreadsheet if it's internal but that certainly is an option.
And it's worth adding that I accept lightning as a useful solution. I just don't like the mistaking of it as an equal to bitcoin, for poor people priced out of the main chain 
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:00:41
Everybody is trustworthy until they aren't. 
The point being you can't have multi-party channels without trust. Are you saying nobody will ever use these channels?
@_date: 2019-04-06 15:49:52
Let me be clear, multi-party channels having a hard trust requirement is enough for me to be concerned about lightning using them, but this post is about a specific attack vector and whether or not this is a gap in such an implementation. 
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:08:03
This concern grew out of my increasing frustration that bitcoiners are labelling lightning as the trustless, sovereign solution for poorer people who can't afford on-chain fees. 
As we now see, lightning is far from trustless, and some of the more complex and efficient lightning setups might have dangerous flaws. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:52:18
*Likely* , so now there might be coded things stopping me from punishing a cheat? or publishing  what I see as the latest channel state ( innocent or cheating). 
We are just getting so far from trustless sovereignty, and I'm still not convinced that the attack surfaces are adequately by these measures.
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:32:55
No it's not required, but it's a suggested route to offload transactions from the mainchain and reduce fee costs.
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:40:45
For sure it's practical, but its not trustless, and it appears to have gaping holes. Which is why I'm here asking for clarity :D
@_date: 2019-04-07 12:32:43
This is the answer I was most afraid of. 
Even if bob chose not to collude. As soon as Alice decides to cheat, Charlie can take all of the money off the table.
Might aswell simplify the scenario to Alice and Charlie colliding.. she declares her intent to cheat and Charlie swoops in and steals everything.
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:29:36
Every LN transaction uses Nlocktime to say when Revocable delivery transactions can or cannot be broadcast.
Just like you can also skip the nlocktime by closing a channel co-operatively, if you are non-cooperative and attempt to broadcast a cheat, breach remedy transactions can also skip a timelock and be broadcast immediately.

If someone published an old state then they will losevthat channel. But to *whom* bearing in mind as soon as this old state is published, alive has to wait 1000 blocks but it's first some first served for everyone else

Everytime bitcoin moves, the tether peg loosens.
Then bitfinex sells some btc for some cheap USDT, supporting the peg, and strangling btc's bullish move.
This exit scam will continue by tether until all of its tokens are redeemed.
Have a nice day.
