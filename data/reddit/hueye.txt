Hmm... Isn't this evidence of one centralized entity impacting the entire network?

This is r/Bitcoin, people here have an _interesting_ mentality regarding profit.

You were only trying to help.

Hopefully the miner fee didn't screw you.

You know, coming from someone who would've loved for it to be a cryptoCURRENCY, I'm kind of disappointed in the entire buy and horde strategy. If people used the coin it would have more real world applications and it would be deemed less of an intangible asset. I was hoping we could buy More with it.
Watching charts and trading alts is fun, but that's not what most people want or care about. People want money to use too, otherwise what the hell is it for? If nobody will want to use it, it's only worth how much some is willing to pay for it - for investment purposes. That's... Not what I was hoping for. I was hoping it would replace all of these government regulated centralized currencies, and give power to the people finally.

Torn between an upvote or a downvote on this one... I have been following this sub and there is some truth to it, but at the same time don't forget it's the magical internet money of the century!

Riiight. There wasn't a problem with the transaction. There was a problem with the nodes in the network and the fees being astronomically high. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:22:54
Try sending smaller amounts of BTC tho... You'll see that cash or Visa is cheaper and sometimes quicker. Fees are too high for basic transactions.

"Duplicate"? Right... Here's my post again, bad bot
Being the cryptocurrency enthusiast I am, I usually try to spend Bitcoin and Litecoin where I can. A few weeks ago I wanted to build a website, so my first thought was to look for registrars that accept Bitcoin as a payment, and I came across [domains4bitcoins]( So I sent around $25 (at the time) worth of Bitcoin to my [Mycelium wallet]( and then proceeded to pay around $18 to the registrar for my order. The transaction fee was about 118 sat/byte amounting to just a couple of dollars, and this was sent as a low-priority transaction.
But now since the exchange rate of Bitcoin has risen, I have around $10 in my Mycelium wallet that I can't do much with. I wanted to send it back to an exchange to trade for Ethereum (which has more purpose for me than the "store-of-value" people are resorting to lately), given all of the forking drama. I tried to broadcast a transaction last night, and I didn't care how long it would take, so I put a relatively low 63 sat/byte fee. I awoke in the morning to see it not even being broadcasted. I didn't mind all of the forking drama until I realized that I can't even move a $10 without getting scalped for &gt;10%.
So right now I'm stuck with $10 of practically useless Bitcoin sitting in my wallet. I never thought this would be an issue. It's useless because I can't practically use it. I will never buy coffee with it, I won't buy another Steam game because my debit card is cheaper. It just sits there until I decide I want to have someone rob me for 10%. Not even VISA does this.
What have we allowed to happen here? This "Bitcoin" is no longer practical for typical transactions. To me, a $10 bill would be favorable over the $10 in Bitcoin that I can't use. And this is NOT typical of other cryptocurrencies out there that are faster, cheaper, etc. 
Thus, I will no longer be supporting or promoting Bitcoin to my peers. This is not the direction Satoshi envisioned, and it no longer empowers individuals. Don't let Bitcoin steal your money [like this](

How many unconfirmed transactions were in the pool last night compared to now? When I sent last night there were probably around 50k which isn't unusual. But I wasn't able to get my payment broadcasted last night at 63 sat/byte, and didn't notice it until the morning. I sent a payment hoping for it to get executed over night, yet 8-10 hours later it wasn't. That's the problem I had. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:03:08
Oh wow! Thanks for finding that out for me, I could've sworn I had it set for 63!
