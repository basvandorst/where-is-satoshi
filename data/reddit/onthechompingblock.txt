I didn't say what I did or didn't believe.  I was only citing the source and the specific measure of money that they reported.  
The problem with using numbers without supporting them, like "90 trillion held on debts", is that no one knows what you mean and what you're trying to say.  If you want to say something about which measure of money supply is the most appropriate to support a specific point, go right ahead.  It doesn't really matter how much money there is by a specific definition of the concept of money unless one is going to use that information to make some kind of claim.  The $90.4 trillion number includes physical and nonphysical, where nonphysical includes money market, savings, checking, and time deposits.  Money market accounts invest in short term corporate debt, for whatever that's worth.

Which number from that source are you talking about?  Is it the US total debt of $69 trillion?  I don't see a related $90 trillion anywhere. 


From my source, "Coins &amp; Bank Notes - The total value of all of the world's coins and banknotes is $7.6 trillion."  So it's all of the world's coins and bank notes, converted to USD.

You need to start using sources.  
[Global debt is $215 trillion and global equity securities are $73 trillion.]( There's going to be some cancelling out (some companies hold debt as an investment, which counts as equity if someone holds a share), but let's say the total is somewhere around $300 trillion.  
Total amount of currency in the world (not just dollars)? About $7.6 trillion.
