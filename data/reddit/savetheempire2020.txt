"short sighted"
That its market manipulation..? or that we are not close to the amount it hits before this market manipulation causes an undercurrent and it crashes? or that this is the dawn of a new global technology and its a joke that its worth is about 17k when its real value is 10-100 times that amount?

So I totally get the animosity against bcash, but if it possible that as crypto acceptance grows, most folks won't know (or care if hodl is profitable) about the origins of bcash and will inevitably assimilate into our reality? What is the better alternative?

Awesome..good to know OPs been on reddit for a whole *two months* pumping out financial and crypto advice...yet cannot read simple graph.
edit: OP was salty enough to delete his entire account- gotta be a shill with 40 more. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:04:05
Ehh.. you are exactly right in investing what you are comfortable with, but you use a lot of false equivalencies. First, loosing 40% of your worth means more if we are talking thousands, not millions, as it hurts the person much more. You are still super comfortable at 1.8m, this is different than starting at 28k and ending at 18k. At which point you are really saying, poor/regular folks can participate very frugally. This behavior will only lead to a new set of bosses, separate from the current financial system, but a de jure *system* nonetheless. Second, you explanation of whale behavior using 10/100/10k btc is misleading- what really matters is the relative price fluctuations and relative affect on the market, where years ago 10k was not worth a relatively large amount, esp compared to what 10btc is worth today. 
The reality is, bitcoin faces some real problems in the future, and applying the simpleton "hodl" principle instead of actually discussing these issues harms the community. As long as newbies are confused and unsure, cryptos will never gain acceptance by regular ma n pa folks, n thus not see its full potential.

@_date: 2017-09-18 20:41:48
Has the asset tangibly appreciated to justify the inflated price? That's why people say these things, because the value spike is only due to optimistic behaviors/ FOMO, not an actual real world change.

1. Prices fluctuate or swing 5-10% quickly...within a few hours. 2. These fluctuations follow patterns depending on time zone and workdays/weekends. 3. One of the things actually measured is the money coming in- The Money Flow index. Right now, even though the volume of trades is at a high, the actual influx of new money is at near historic lows- its just coordinating trading, back and forth, by different whale investors. 4. This pattern was actually discussed in the last Coindesk weekly update. It was forming for a week before that. 5. Last and most credible, all this information is easily accessible using Kraken, Coindesk and Smith and Crown. Its just a matter of putting together the pieces and having the courage to actually wait for the true low before buying in. Its temping to buy everytime there's a dip, but right now we are at the 2nd shoulder of the Head &amp; Shoulder pattern. I just dont think we are through the entire storm yet.

... so securities fraud, which is exactly what bitcoin haters point to when claiming BTC is going to fail, which examining the history of commodity trading, sec fraud would tank BTC. How does the community address with without creating regulation ? Hoe does the community justify this behavior, yet talk mad shit when major banks trying to do something similar, but 100 times less damaging?  It won't be adaptability or adaptability that tanks BTC.... its the fraud that occurs all day every day and everyone just looks the other way ...

Coinbase is by far the easier interface to work with. All BTC houses/exchanges have fees, so pay attention. Its not just you, the whole blockchain uni/ language is a lil confusing. Just stick with it, youll figure it out. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:52:30
Neither. Whale investor bots competing with each other to manipulate prices. On kraken or trading view you can examine the actual new money influx using the MFI ( money flow index)

So than what should we follow- Im confused as the the tangible advice? You can study the trends for a couple weeks, which may indicate sideways movement, but now, when one steps back, we are clearly headed for a more serious depression (Eth back to 180-220 levels, LTC 40s) Simple indicators that have been true with the market, ADX, RSI, MFI, MACD- ALL indicate a correction back to early/ even pre August levels...I guess at this point, it still seems to be in an artifical uptick, and the time to stock up is still not yet upon us.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:59:44
Sorry, you're talking to the Pro-Bitcoin Echo Chamber. No actual advice or critical thinking as the the actual fluctuations, just a berating of "HODL HODL HODL" (in the rhythm of Monorail Monorail Monorail) What I fear is that it didnt work too well for Springfield. Most the major index and measures indicate a continued downtrend, which common sense SHOULD kick in and tell one to wait for at least some indication of a reversing trend before re initiating buy positions. We have no indication of that happening. NOW, with the Metro news expected on 9/18, ETH could see gains, however, make sure you examine the Money Flow Index to ensure these are real gains, not just whales manipulating the prices. PM me if you want to talk to someone about this who HASNT drank the koolaid. 
Also, reddit is FULL of pro cyrpto shills- they have the telltale "redditor for 4 days/ redditor for 6 weeks" tag. It means they just created an account recently. If you check their comment history, and its nothing but BTC info, def a paid shill. There are several on this very thread. Point is- be careful.

Exxxxxxxactly. Friday when the volume skyrocketed then dropped 24 hours later was the major market shift to SKorea and Japan.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:55:12
Not to mention what I said mimics OPs message....and dude/dudette has NAILED it the past 6 dips...
As far as recovering...define recovering? For BTC, We could see an increase of a few thousand and then buckle down again. You cant read crypto markets the same as standard commodities- the regulation in place for regular markets provides a backdrop of certainty (a fraudulent structure is still a structure) This is why some regs are necessary, to prevent market manipulation. OP acknowledged this in his last statement "something funny going on." This prevents a big chunk of the U.S. Regular peoples money from really entering the market- this type of market manipulation is nothing new- thats why we have the SEC and anti-trust laws. Until thats addressed, its going to be a rollercoaster of mostly recycled money. With that, I think it will be addressed and for those who buy now for the long haul will be happy...Its also all relative, mind you. Waiting and buying at $500 less is worth it if you are buying low volume..
For ETH, like all cryptos, speculation often rues the day and I'm thinking prices will start to rise on the 17th, a few hours before the big Metropolis news. Its still too early to tell if that is enough to slow or even correct this 2 week downtrend. ETH itself is different than BTC, so even thou their relative values seems inexorable intertwined, I could see ETH developing its independence and standing on its own in the next 12 months. This is also based on how Vikalik Buterin is Butterin' up the Rooskies (Russians). (sorry, that was tacky af. my bad.) Also, I expect big things from Atlant, his real estate platform. However, if ICOs keep taking hits, its likely to correct down to levels before the big ICO boom.

@_date: 2017-09-23 15:17:18
Don't worry OP, for those who pay attention, this type of manipulation is done in a daily basis. We all know it, which is why big money investors won't get on board n why Wall Street crooks are actually correct in calling the exchanges a scam. Because they are. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:36:06
I surely hope youre right- it would show the market has actual strength to tough out storms. August was just such an incredible month on top of a incredible year. Market corrections are ok, they are even arguably a natural part of the process. I totally understand the hodlers, I just dont personally think, looking at the market data, right now is the low, i.e. best time to stock up. The current trading is all sideways, meaning its just a few high coin holders using market fluctuations to pump n dump. For them a 8-15 gain is a HUGE profit. However, the actual money in the market is stale- its just recycled trades.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:10:44
Nor is the price an actual measure of whether it's a scam or not... it could just be a bigger, 100k sized scam.  What bad logic, OP. Of course, he's admitted to being the type that gets tripped up on hurdles that are behind him. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:45:06

I was refering specifically to Eth and LTC, but generally BTC I'm saying between 33-3000, esp if the China rumors keep bubbling up. Following the current trend ETH would correct to 200-220, maybe lower to May levels, BUT the Metropolis news will surely allow the whales to spike to price. LTC will correct, bounce around the 50 mark. 
Generally speaking, user confidence will effect price, and user confidence are at historic lows for ETH, the other times seen when the price was about $15 and around $140. Now that could mean were bottoming out, it could mean we are strongly in an existing trend toward pre-bubble prices. I tend to feel the latter. Again however, Metropolis could be a godsend for Eth hodlers. EDIT: 3500 is a strong mental barrier for BTC to drop below. It may hover there.

@_date: 2017-09-17 17:19:22
If you are in a position to "see it all the time", then I dont need to tell you the plethora of regulations and regulatory bodies like the SEC that limit market manipulation tactics. I am in no way saying the current financial system is not corrupt. In fact, the contrary is true- which is why I own altcoins and believe in the BTCs overall future. But we shouldnt deny that, much like ejecting the China uncertainty, ejecting or regulating the whales that manipulate the market to the detriment of the average user and the underlying idea itself, would be for the best.
