Not just in court. A person asserting a claim has the burden of proof by default in a debate.

It smacks of the whole "[faces of atheism]( thing that embarassed out of the default subs.

Those are products—not decentralized technologies. They still rely on one or more entities to produce them. In the same way iTunes is not decentralized, a car or a telephone cannot be decentralized. They are also subject to heavy regulation from a central authority.

A burden of proof is different than a standard of proof. "Beyond a reasonable doubt" is a standard of proof/evidence required to prove certain things. A burden of proof refers to the party required to prove something first in order to shift the burden to the other party.   
  
In normal debates, a person asserting a claim bears the logical burden of proof for the claim they asserted. For example, a person claims "There are aliens on the moon." They bear the initial burden of proof for that claim. The person they are debating is not called on to disprove their assertion.  
  
Here, Newsweek had the initial burden of proving that Dorian Nakamoto was Satoshi Nakamoto. This claim is fairly extraordinary considering how many people have tried to locate Satoshi Nakamoto and the lengths to which Satoshi Nakamoto has gone to conceal his identity. So, the standard of proof is somewhat higher than normal. At a minimum, Newsweek had to show that it was more likely than not that Dorian was the actual Satoshi. The Newsweek report provided basically no evidence to support their claim. They certainly didn't make it seem likely that Dorian was Satoshi. 
  
So, because Newsweek was the party making the initial assertion about Satoshi's identity, and because they failed to meet their burden, we can disregard their report without more evidence. We don't actually reach the question of whether Satoshi's comment was legitimate or not. It doesn't matter.

I just asked my japanese wife and she said, "pretty common."

The original comment that started this conversation is:


"Her" in this instance is referring to Leah McGrath Goodman—the reporter from Newsweek. She still bears the burden to prove her assertion that Dorian is Satoshi. So, we're debating whether Leah met that burden.
Your comment is a bit of a non-sequitur in that it focuses on Satoshi's alleged comment, rather than the substance of this series of comments—whether Leah Goodman met her burden of proving Dorian is Satoshi.
Your point, although valid, is not relevant here to prove or disprove my comments.

Is there anyone in SoCal that was damaged by these events and would be interested in suing?

If your investment in Bitcoin was contingent on your belief that Satoshi Nakamoto was dead, you're an idiot. Personally, I think this single comment enhances the mystery. I can't pull myself away from this subreddit for the first time in years. It's exciting and the increased attention could help the adoption of BTC.

An appeal is not a retrial. Not even close.

OP's explanation doesn't make sense. Seizure of assets is only permitted against criminals—not third parties, like MtGox or Dwolla would be in this case. The government cannot shut down exchanges between Wells Fargo and Chase merely because a criminal once transferred assets between the two. It doesn't work that way. The government in this case obviously believes that either MtGox or Dwolla are themselves criminal suspects.
Also, does the Department of Homeland Security get involved in small crimes like OP suggests?

Are you a merchant and have you used this? If so, how to you account for taxes when accepting BTC? I've been trying to figure this out for a while now and I am not sure how to accept BTC and keep my books organized.

Kind of. These actions seem to suggest that we're in the "Napster-phase" of digital currency. Digital currency was, at first, not taken seriously. Now, it is regularly reported on in the media and eyebrows are being raised. Various interests, like the ~~record labels~~ banks and financial institutions, see their positions of power threatened and may be leveraging their connections to crack down on the exchanges. All the while, they're unable to attack the root of the problem—an inadequate pre-existing monetary system.
Several exchanges will be shut down or attacked by the government in various ways, but new ones will pop up faster than they are shut down. At this point, we'll be in the "KaZaA-phase" of bitcoin. Actions against first-adopting companies like MtGox will continue, all the while leaving new adopters free to find creative work-arounds.
Eventually, several mainstream companies will catch on and adopt Bitcoin in new and intelligent ways. They'll make using Bitcoins easier and more accessible to the public. This will be the "iTunes-phase" of bitcoin. Bitcoin will lose many of the characteristics it currently has, like cheap trading and relative anonymity. But the underlying structure that makes it strong will remain and result in a major increase in popularity. At the same time, the more tech-savvy piratebay-type people that are unable or unwilling to pay more or lose anonymity will use more underground exchanges to participate in Bitcoin.
It's just important to see where we are on the timeline. We're in the very beginning. Governments react slowly to change and won't be able to keep up with, or shut down Bitcoin. But these efforts are important to lend to Bitcoin's legitimacy. If Bitcoin did not withstand trials, we could not reach the next step of adoption, and it would not be adopted by major companies. The confidence simply wouldn't be there unless shareholders were assured that Bitcoin wasn't going anywhere, even in the face of government intervention.
