The O is doubling down offering new incentives to btc friendly buyers, giving 1% of the sale back as club-O rewards points. Personally I think the people over at O get it. This will heftily reduce their credit card transaction fees and boost the interest in their rewards program while simultaneously creating more buzz on the internet.

On top of that, California has voted unanimously to make a move to make the virtual coins fair money and officially legal. 
MIT has a bitcoin club that sold out its tickets in minutes for an influential speaker and had to turn people away at the door because there wasn't even standing room.
Fact of the matter is, the people with brains are going all-in on bitcoin and you should do the same.

Well I guess that's why it's an open letter then, And besides, it benefits everyone, not just the select few. Do you imagine that in the 30th century that they will still be using paper dollars? Absolutely everyone will have moved to electronic currency. They will think about trading paper dollars and gold as if we were bartering goats for grain
 Ultimately, the argument that it is a gamble, and that is a bad idea in case it bottoms out, are relatively irrelevant and outdated modes of thinking which will inevitably be replaced by thoughts which are not obsolete. 
 If you can dispute any of the point that I made that I actually wrote, I would love to hear it. Companies stand to do nothing but profit from the acceptance of this currency and the sooner these facts get out the quicker the myths will be dispelled about this powerful and futuristic tool of trade, capitalism, and democracy.
