You need to upgrade to the latest version. 
Old versions add too low a miner's fee.
Do a Tools | Reset blockchain and transactions afterwards to resync to the network.
Then send again.

That was our reasoning too.

We've run the initial version of MultiBit (which we now call MultiBit Classic) as donationware for several years now.
Unfortunately it is not effective. You can see the transaction traffic here:
Donations don't even cover the cost of servers and SSL certs etc, nevermind labour.
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:57:40
Have a read of the blog article we wrote a while ago explaining our rationale for having (tiny) fees:
It was written a while ago when minimum transaction fees were 10,000 satoshi per KB.
Out of the box MultiBit HD adds 3,000 satoshi per KB for the miners and we have a client fee of 1,000 satoshi per KB.
The cup of coffee I just bought cost £2.45 which is 1,593,750 sat. Thus you could buy over 1500 sends and an infinite number of receives for a cup of coffee.

@_date: 2015-12-05 14:18:36
Fees are worked out per KB of transaction size.
In both MultiBit Classic and HD the default fee rate is 0.1 mBTC / KB.
Small transactions are less than 1000 bytes so would hence have a fee of 0.000 1 BTC.
Users can adjust this fee up and down using a slider but probably most leave it where it is as long as it works.
@_date: 2015-06-10 08:36:45

bitcoinj-alice is a bit too 'BIP44 specific' for it to go into bitcoinj and be used by everyone.
devrandom has a very similar fork so I expect we'll work on it together to get it into the canonical bitcoinj. We can do it all together on the bitcoinj mailing list.
It's fiddly work the HD code as stuff like serialisation roundtripping can catch you out.

1. Agreed.
2. The addresses aren't specific to the wallet id (it's a sample of a bounded set) so in general we cannot match an address to a single wallet id.
3+4 As per our privacy agreement we delete web logs after 2 weeks.

MultiBit HD supports Trezor:

Thanks for your reply.
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:54:52
For the original MultiBit client (which we call MultiBit Classic now) we'll issue maintenance updates for a long time.
These will be things like security, network, bug fixes but all the 'nice' development will go into MultiBit HD.
For MultiBit HD we have all your wallet/ contact/ payment info encrypted on disk which is more secure than MultiBit Classic.
The network behaviour is similar (both use the same library - bitcoinj)
The BIG advantage of MultiBit HD is that you can use a Trezor to secure your funds. This means that your private keys never touch your desktop computer and ups the ante security wise considerably
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:47:29
We bundle up the 1,000 sat per send and every 20 or so transactions attach a transaction output to your transaction that goes to an address we control.
It's randomly added to between 15 and 25 transactions (average 20) and it's position is random in the transaction outputs.
If you don't want any extra outputs added to your transactions any amount sent to the MultiBit donation address in that wallet counts as fee paid. Thus you could send a dollar to us and no client fee would get added for a few hundred sends.
edit: When a wallet is created it does what we call a BRIT exchange with multibit.org and gets a list of 50 addresses (that we control) and adds them into the wallet. It will choose one of these addresses at random to pay fees to each time it needs to.
The list of 50 addresses varies daily.

If you create your new Trezor wallet with MultiBit HD:
+ your seed phrase never leaves your Trezor
+ your master public key (MPK) never leaves your desktop computer
+ your MPK is never saved to your desktop computer, it is read fresh from your Trezor every time you plug it in
@_date: 2015-06-23 10:08:31
Yes - it was unrelated.
The downtime of multibit.org yesterday evening was a network connectivity issue at the datacentre we use.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:19:02
It only picks up localhost.
We've tried very hard to keep MultiBit HD simple for non-bitcoin users   so limit the amount of 'configure everything'
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:36:16
We wrote what coinwallet's intention was in the first paragraph (in the link) for overall context. I believe you are correct though that they 'dialled it down' when they saw what effect they were having.
Even at the level they ran it at it was pretty clear that transactions with lower fees than the stress test transactions were not getting confirmed.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:04:01
The BRIT exchange only happens once, when the wallet is created. We want users to be standalone as much as possible.
For redemption you really need a finite (though large) set of addresses.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:03:37
We do have a 'BRIT wallet id' yes but it is not connected to anything. It is derived from your wallet words at wallet creation using various trapdoor functions. We have no idea where in the world that wallet is. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:14:02
MultiBit HD connects directly to Bitcoin Core/ XT nodes to get transactions whereas Electrum connects to intermediate servers. They both use [SPV]( to verify transactions.
Both support hardware wallets so you can keep your private keys off your main computer.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:05:29
The agreement is part of the setup process for a wallet and also you have to agree to the agreement before you download the installer.
The running total is also shown on the send confirm screen.
It really couldn't be more open. We're not trying to hide anything.

The BRIT exchange is designed flexibly with a version number so can change over time as required.
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:39:25
Hi Alex,
BRIT isn't perfect privacy wise but with the addition of 'donate-and-waive' it's pretty good.
Micropayment systems have various constraints such as:
+ robustness against DDOS of multibit.org
+ you want a bounded set of redemption addresses or redemption gets problematic
+ simplicity - we actually started off with an address derivation scheme (not HD but similar) but it was too complicated in real use.
Privacy isn't all or nothing. For instance, using a typical client like Electrum or Copay gives ALL your tx traffic to a set of servers. We add a - disguised as much as possible single output - to, on average, 20 sends.
TBH, if there wasn't monetisation in MBHD it wouldn't exist as we wouldn't have spent the time on it.
@_date: 2015-12-03 21:45:31
You are thinking of instawallet.com , which was a great wallet in it's day.
If I remember correctly, Jan Moller was the dev. He subsequently wrote the mycelium backend (before moving on).
It was shut down in an orderly fashion I.e. plenty of time to get your bitcoins out. I cannot remember exactly why it was shut down but perhaps someone else can chime in.
@_date: 2015-06-23 06:07:49
A BRIT exchange with multibit.org occurs once when you create a new wallet.
If multibit.org is down when you do this MultiBit HD falls back to a hardwired list of addresses.

Yes it is so we can update them - we often add more detail and clarify things as we go. When we produce a release we bundle the latest copy so as to produce a fall back (it'll be out of date but still useful).
The BRIT addresses are updated daily for reasons as you suggest.

MultiBit HD will automatically pick up a Bitcoin Core/ XT on localhost yes. It connects to _more_ than that as it 'likes' to connect to 10 nodes or so to monitor transaction propagation.

Can you please actually read how BRIT works ?
One transaction output is added to every 15 to 25 sends. Not every transaction.

You can 'optionally donate' in the Tools | Fees screen to do exactly what you ask.
Perhaps have a play with MultiBit HD and see how it works in practice?
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:13:27
It's a small fee per send of 1,000 sat yes.
In beta testing users suggested that it would be nice if any donation made to us (the MultiBit donation address) in that wallet would count towards fees. We added that in. It's a thankyou from us.
It also means that no BRIT transaction outputs get attached to your transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:29:15
The wallet seeds in MultiBit HD are BIP 32 compliant for the normal wallets the user produces.
Trezor wallets are BIP 44.
We only support what in myTrezor.com nomenclature is called 'Account 1' for technical reasons. This is for both types of wallets. There's a more detailed explanation here:
Also in the 'Manage wallet | Wallet dashboard" screen we have a section where the capabilities for that wallet are described. The description of a Trezor wallet, for instance, is:

We don't plan to increase the feature set (particularly) over the summer and that time will be spent hardening the code.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:48:08
That's a great question.
You are right, I am sure any developer of a mainstream Bitcoin wallet could get a well paying software job . . . but then they wouldn't be working fulltime on developing their Bitcoin wallet ! 
It has taken countless hours to get to where we are now. Have a look at the list of issues (=units of work) in the MBHD repo:
This doesn't even address the _other_ repos we have for BRIT server, multibit-hardware, hid4java.
There's also a fork to bitcoinj for BIP 44 support.
Honestly it is thousands of hours of work.
The Starbucks I use as my 'office' I know all the baristas so well I buy them birthday cards.
The reason why there are so few decentralised, open wallets is that they take time to write now, lots of time and that costs money. 
You can see with the slow down of DarkWallet that enthusiasm can only take a project so far. The MacOS version of Hive has a similar problem, the dev really wants to upgrade it to HD but he knows that is a big job and cannot do it in 'hobby mode'.
edit: Missed you question on how much open source software I use. Yes a lot - as much as I can and I am very grateful. I still have bills to pay though. :-)
@_date: 2015-06-23 10:05:25

You want to have a look at BIPs 70, 71, 72.
1) Merchant sends you a payment request with info like amount, addresses to pay to, description, expiry date. Signed by their SSL cert.
2) User choose to pay, or not. Sends off tx to the merchant.
3) Merchant then replies with a payment acknowledgement (=receipt).
4) User stores payment request, payment and payment ack as evidence of payment.
It's implemented in a few wallets like MultiBit HD and BitPay support it in their merchant software
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:52:39
It will add one transaction output on average every 20 sends. One output is about 100 bytes (ish) so there is an overhead of about 5 bytes per send yes.

Sorry that your experience with MultiBit has not gone smoothly. 
Like all software, there's a process of continuous improvement, bug fixing etc. You might like to try the most recent version and be surprised.
To get back to the OP, after Mike's analysis we couldn't in all honesty leave the blockchain.info import code in. We realise it's an inconvenience to people but any code to do with private keys has to be as bulletproof as we can make it.
Since the v0.5.18 release on Monday we've had about 10,000 downloads and so far have not seen any more reports of the original issue (mentioned in the blog article). It generally takes about a month for people to upgrade to a new version so we'll get more feedback over the next few weeks.

Gary Rowe and I are writing a library, called trezorj, to provide low level communications with the Trezor device. We will be using it MultiBit HD- which is on the desktop - but it is written to be standalone
As it is standalone it would be easy for an Android dev to use with OTG. It is Java so would be straightforward to use on an Android device.
It is on github, open source, called 'trezorj'
@_date: 2014-12-17 13:08:32
In the article it states:
" All lightweight bitcoin clients currently use such a workaround."
when talking about intermediate servers.
Note that MultiBit connects directly to the Bitcoin network and doesn't use any intermediate servers. (Well, to be totally accurate, it looks up the in-app help from multibit.org)
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:17:48
If you want to fork MultiBit HD and produce a clone you are free to do so. Make sure you make it clear it's _your_ code appropriately signed so that people know where to go to for support.
We recommend delivering over HTTPS and pony up for an EV cert too so that people can check the 'green bar' in the download URLs.
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:27:01
We are interested in how people think about paying for our work definitely. I think the thing most people hate about DRM is the R - restricted - oh sorry 'rights' :-)
With HD wallets you always have your 12 word seed so can always move your wallet to another client.
In MBHD we also add a contacts database and more payments information. These are encrypted on your disk but there is absolutely no DRM on these files. You need to know your wallet password to decrypt them but there is no vendor lock in or any of that nonsense.
Our philosophy with BRIT is to be quite open and say:
"If you use MBHD we want you to pay a small amount every transaction you send. In return we aren't going to mine you for personal information or target you for ads etc".
We are charging for the app, as you describe, just in a Pay As You Go manner.
It's all open (in every sense of the word) what we are doing so there are no hidden product placements or similar.
@_date: 2014-06-20 12:17:02
There is a WalletTool that Mike Hearn wrote in bitcoinj which gives you a command line interface. You can do things like make a wallet, send a tx and receive bitcoin.
You'd probably end up needing to extend it if you were doing anything serious with it but it's all open source, MIT licence.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:41:20
MultiBit HD connects to Bitcoin Core (or XT) nodes to get all the transaction information and to send transactions.
We use the multibit.org server for various housekeeping things as follows:
+ the help files (we fail over to a copy stored in the app if multibit.org is not available)
+ the BRIT exchange at wallet creation (this fails over to a fixed set of addresses if multibit.org is not available)
+ a check for if there is a new version (continues as normal if it cannot find the appropriate file).
Thus in all cases your local copy of MultiBit HD carries on working. (As long as the Bitcoin network itself is running)

Also, make sure you are using the latest version (currently 0.5.17). There were various fixes that went into 0.5.16 that decreases the chances of transactions getting stuck on a send.
(For instance just before it sends the transaction it pings the servers it knows about to check they are still alive).
@_date: 2014-12-23 10:31:18
Hi Chris,
The main thing with MBHD is that it's not released in production form yet.
Thus it's not ready to be given to newbies just yet. That is the target user base though.
Also, mainly due to people forgetting where they put their wallets with MultiBit Classic we now produce a uniquely named directory for each wallet and it's always put in the user data directory on disk. It does not have a 'portable' mode like Classic.
All the user files e.g wallet, contacts, history etc are all stored encrypted on disk - they are totally opaque without a password or Trezor.
@_date: 2014-04-09 18:38:59
The MultiBit wallets are stored all in memory so you've probably hit a limit in either your physical memory or the size of the Java virtual machine that you've got allocated to it. You can adjust the size allocated to the Java virtual machine - On Windows the app is called something like "Java Console".
Generally it is more useful to everybody if you do bug reports on the bug database as it is better suited to tracking things etc. This is here:
The MultiBit logs, which are in your log directory (next to where our default wallet is stored), would confirm that this was the problem for sure so posting those in any bug report would be useful.
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:02:17
Yeah - it is actually 'hierarchical deterministic' but that is a bit too long to type so everyone just calls them HD.

@_date: 2014-04-11 13:03:27
Nothing. It will all be open source except for our MultiBit branded icons etc that we put in a branch and defend the copyright of.
If someone wants to clone the generic code, brand it themselves, sign the binaries, provide a secure SSL server to download from and support users issues etc then they can do so.
They can do this taking no fee (i.e remove BRIT entirely) or add a fee that gets paid to themselves if they want.
If they think a version with in-app ads is going to more popular, they can do that if they want.
Personally I hate in-app ads and they create security problems and leak privacy but if that's what people want a dev can make it if they want.

MultiBit uses bitcoinj, which keeps track of whether transaction outputs are spent (or not).
If you receive two 'identical' transactions one would get onto a block and the other would get marked as dead in the UI.
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:05:54
On the GUI we are calling it a **client fee** which, I hope you will agree, is pretty clear and easy to localise. 
The **miner's fee** is actually more difficult to describe and localise as it implicitly assumes the reader understands the Bitcoin protocol (we don't really want to assume MultiBit HD users know anything about the nuts and bolts of the Bitcoin protocol itself).
We call it BRIT as it is a nice backronym (we are both British) - it's more a traditional client-server encrypted secret sharing protocol than anything else. If you have a have a read of the technical docs mentioned in the blog article you'll see it uses PGP and AES encryption to pass sensitive information to and fro.

MultiBit dev here.
This is not the way to ask for support on open source projects.
For anyone with a support query about MultiBit please look at the help page on [multibit.org]( There are a number of articles on 'quick fixes' and then the user is pointed to the github issues page:
This solves probably 99% of people's issues.
The OP contacted me by bitcointalk.org privately. Hmm, if privacy is a real issue then that's ok but github is better as it is more efficient (e.g. searchable). But then the OP just posted all my replies on reddit which is hardly privacy aware.
Generally in life if someone says they are 'too busy' to help it either means:
A) There are brushing you off.
B) They actually ARE too busy.
Let me explain why B) is the case here.
Since October 2013 Gary Rowe and I have been working on the next version of MultiBit (MultiBit HD). It has a lot of improvements. Critically for this thread it has deterministic wallets which makes private key regeneration possible and reduces significantly the chance of private key loss.
In addition it has rolling backups, local backups and cloud backups.
It's a big job and it's probably still a month from being in beta.
I work on it every day. I mean EVERY day. I cannot remember the last day I had a completely free day (except for last Christmas).
You can only do so much so there are a whole stack of things in my personal life that are on hold to get MBHD out the door. 
To give one example: My electricity is run from solar/ diesel, running through a battery store. The batteries are old and need replacing. (This is normal - they only last 1000 recharges or so). 
So I need to replace them - this will take a few days to take out the couple hundred kilos of batteries, replace them, wire them up, dispose of them etc.
This job is on hold until MBHD is out.
So my power envelope in the evening is about 6 watts. I can have a couple of 3W LED lights on. That's it.
Getting MBHD out the door will help improve the security of a lot (hundreds of thousands) of people's private keys so I don't mind making a 'short term' sacrifice. By short term I mean six months.
I hope this explains why I told you that there isn't personal support for MultiBit at the moment. The good thing with wallets and bitcoin is that generally they don't go anywhere (except when stolen). Just keep your wallet/ logs etc secure.

Well yes you could separate them if you wanted (and run two services that were very similiar). By knowing the wallet replay date accurately you both save time if someone is restoring their wallet and, more importantly, they get all the transactions for it.
We are expecting with HD wallets that people will have the same seed across multiple devices/ wallets so that adds a little complexity.

We use a very nice dropwizard implementation that Gary Rowe (the other MultiBit developer) developed. There is no front facing bash no.
@_date: 2014-05-24 09:44:52
Thanks for your patience.
We've added in a few features to help users such as:
+ You can recover your password if you forget it (using your seedphrase).
+ The flexibility of creating wallets anywhere and opening and closing them can create usability problems. In MBHD we always create the wallets in the user data directory with a name created from the seed.
+ Each wallet has it's own blockchain so they each sync individually.
+ There's also an option to set up a 'cloud backup directory' so that you can set up a remote sync. This means that if you lose your laptop, or it is stolen, you can recover your wallet and contacts.
+ The UI is simplified to make it easier to use.
+ There are more exchanges available

To sync a wallet from a date MBHD connects to a bitcoin core node and gets the transactions relevant to that wallet (filtered with a bloom filter)
We are encrypting everything and adding in a session id in the message to avoid man in the middling. You could do it differently if you wanted.

We have found that about 1 in a 1000 people who download MultiBit donate so you are part of the 0.1% !
Donations would be a nicer way to fund development but alas we have found that it does not work.

Thanks for your feedback about MultiBit.
Yes as we bundle up the small per transaction amounts over 20 to 30 sends it might be a few months between payments for each user. If you used it, say, once a week. you'd hardly notice it as would be 12 cents every six months.
In the long run (if you have a lot of users) this will smooth out and become a regular income stream.

In the upcoming MultiBit HD we have put the default display unit to millis (shown as an 'm' followed by the font awesome Bitcoin symbol).
Whilst it's a cosmetic change it does seem to make things easier and the numbers appear more normal.
You can also configure it to show: BTC, mBTC, uBTC, sat or use the Bitcoin icon or XBT (with m and u) as you like. The 'u' is rendered as the Greek letter mu as it is an SI prefix.

When a Trezor is initialized, it shows on its screen the 12 words of the HD wallet's seed phrase for you to write down.
These will be compatible with any HD wallet, so you'll be able to get your bitcoin back should your Trezor be crushed by an unfriendly steam roller.
HD wallet support I know is going into at least MultiBit, Electrum and Armory (probably more).
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:41:40
There is one private key for each address in MultiBit.
When you create a new receiving address there is a new private key and hence you need to create new backups.
The change in a transaction goes back to the first address in the wallet if there is a single address and goes back to the second address if there is more than one.
In theory you can have the same private keys in multiple wallets but I don't recommend it as it is very easy to create a confusing mish mosh.

With MultiBit you can:
1) Go to the 'Request' tab.
2) On the top right there is a QR code for the receiving address shown.
3) Add in a label which will be added to the QR code. When people scan your QR code most phone apps show this text to the user.
4) Drag and drop the QR code to your computer desktop. This creates a PNG file that you can send off to your T shirt printer.
Make sure you encrypt and backup the wallet that has the address in.

That looks quite similar to the dark theme that we have.
The balance can also have a fiat amount and exchange - we've put it top left as that is dominant to the top right.
We've also commisioned a new icon that is going top right so it will end up very much like your header but with the left and right switched.

A workaround, which I think you have worked out, is to split your transaction into amounts less that 1000 BTC
@_date: 2014-05-04 19:57:28
You probably didn't need to do an export of your private keys from QT and then import them into MultiBit. This can be difficult to do without error because you also have hidden change addresses in QT.
If you transfered bitcoins via a normal send then the balance will be controlled by the private key of the new address in MultiBit.
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:09:57
It's spam. The amounts will never confirm as they are below the dust limit.
You are best ignoring them.
The bitcoinj based wallets (MultiBit,  Schildbach wallet, Hive) don't even put them in their wallets now - they get 'spamfiltered'.

Have a read of the blog article we wrote after investigating this:
@_date: 2014-05-05 10:33:48
There aren't really more bitcoins.
A transaction has transaction inputs and transaction outputs.
If you have a transaction that pays from an address that is missing in the wallet (but should be there) and sends it to an address that is in the wallet it looks like you are increasing the balance. It looks like someone just sent you bitcoin but actually you've just transfered bitcoin from one address of yours to another.
In the full wallet that has both addresses you would mark the input as spent. As you don't have that address in the smaller wallet it looks like you haven't spent it as you don't consider it is yours.
You can as easily get a balance that is too high as is too low if you don't have all the correct addresses (and transactions).

We have looked at this yes.
At the moment the miner's fee is fairly predictable but in future it will be determined by the supply and demand for blockspace. This won't be for a while yet but it's coming. 
As our costs are unrelated to mining operations we wanted not to couple one to the other as it introduces more volatility.

It is pretty tricky to have a naming service that is resistant to phishing. 
As bitcoin payments are irreversible you have to be sure the address/ address generator for a name is correct.
We have put a Contacts database into MultiBit HD but at the moment it only 'believes' entries you have added in yourself.
We have to be conservative so we will leave off any remote lookup of names for now.
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:27:16
That's one of the reasons why we have opened BRIT so that it can be reviewed widely to look for vulnerabilities.
As for your later points we'll have to see how Bitcoin develops - it's pretty hard to plan more than 6 months or a year ahead I think.
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:53:09
There's a slightly different usage of addresses in MBHD:
When you 'Request bitcoin' you fill out what QR code label you want and a private note. This becomes a 'payment request' a bit like an invoice.
Payment to that address is then matched to that address and shown on the UI.
Change addresses on sends are unique and calculated deterministically.
As we target new users we don't show the details of the actual bitcoin transaction (well, except deep in the Transaction details wizard).
There will be lots of HD compatible wallets - it sounds like you want more advanced features than who MultiBit HD is targeted to. Just try out all the coming wallets and pick the one you most like.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:08:19
HD support is not in the currently released Electrum but I believe ThomasV plans to support BIP32/39 in a future version yes.
I know he and Mike Hearn (who has been writing the BIP32 support into bitcoinj) have been liaising to make sure the two are compatible.
@_date: 2014-04-08 09:51:34
With the randomly generated private keys in MultiBit the 32 bytes that describe it are absolutely critical. (That's why backing up your wallet is so important).
If the private keys in the OP's wallet are damaged and there is no copy in his backups/ private key exports then the OP has a problem yes.
Wallets are only files on a disk at the end of the day so aren't incorruptible.
It does not mean however that there is a systemic problem with ALL MultiBit wallets. There are a lot of MultiBit wallets on people's disks [MultiBit downloads reach 1.5 million] (
Of course it takes time to go through a wallet and logs so that is just an overview.

It is perfectly feasible to distribute Bitcoin software via bittorrent. The main issue is security as people have posted in other posts.
For instance with MultiBit we sign the binaries with PGP and the release notes have all the SHA256 hashes in for people to check against. The release notes themselves we Bitcoin sign with the MultiBit donation address (which only we have the private key for). You can check the Bitcoin signature using the "Tools | Verify signature' within MultiBit itself. 
All these files could be bittorrented.

Try doing a full reset of your wallet rather than setting a date.
In the latest code (0.5.16) this is the only option as it is the safest so you might want to upgrade.

It's hard to say exactly what is in that wallet now without going through it in detail. What that wallet contains now is:
1) The original transactions from QT to the original MultiBit address
2) Some of the private keys that did the sending, but probably missing some of the change addresses.
3) Because MultiBit bloom filters, if there are transactions only involving missing addresses and external addresses then they won't be in the wallet (as they will be bloom filtered out as being not relevant). According to the keys in the MultiBit wallet they are not relevant (But of course in reality they are).
Really its a lot less error prone sending bitcoin rather than importing and exporting private keys.

There are various checks you can do to make sure you have the right installer for MultiBit.
The best starting point is to make sure you downloaded it from 
You can check the SHA256 hash of the file you have. I publish this in the release notes here:
(You can check the release notes are genuine by verifying the bitcoin signature on that release.txt against the MultiBit Bitcoin donation address).
I always upload the installers to virustotal.com so you can cross check against that too.
If you want to check the PGP signatures we provide there is an article here:
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:20:51
You are right to look carefully at the distribution of all of the Bitcoin wallet software.
For the distribution of MultiBit we do the following:
+ we always encourage people to download directly from 
+ multibit.org is hosted on a dedicated server in Strasburg, France.
+ I (Jim Burton) sign all the build artifacts with this PGP key:
(You can see the cosigners of that key at that URL.)
+ The Windows installer is authenticode signed with a 'personal level' certificate from startcom.org. 
+ The Mac version is signed with my Apple developer id
+ The release notes specify the SHA256 hashes of all the installers and executables. 
+ The release notes are bitcoin signed with the multibit.org donation address that I control.
As to trust in me and my abilities. All the code for MultiBit (and the multibit.org website too actually) is open source under the MIT licence.
Gary Rowe is the co-developer of MultiBit HD (the next version of MultiBit) and has recently added a deterministic build process to the building of the build artifacts for MultiBit HD. This means the basic build artifacts can be independently reproduced. The signing process we're not sure how to incorporate into this actually - obviously signing keys aren't distributed.
MultiBit HD will also be open source under the MIT licence except for some branding icons etc that we do not want clones to use as it will confuse users.
As to my technical ability: fortunately the heavy "crypto" lifting for MultiBit is done by bitcoinj - primarily written by Mike Hearn.
My background:
+ I graduated from Cambridge University, England in Maths at the age of twenty.
+ I've worked in the research/ development/ new products area for : Marconi Electronics, Pfizer, SmithKineBeecham, a pharmaceutical contract house (Statwood) and since 2000 for Infor (an accounting software company) and BancTec (a banking software firm).
+ Gary Rowe and I are the directors for the Bitcoin advisory company: Bitcoin Solutions Ltd - the website is here:

Yes - the transaction fee goes to the miner and the client fee goes to the client developers (or upstream projects they use). When you do a send the UI shows everything so there are no surprises.
Currently the miner's fee is set at pretty much the minimum you can use - this is 0.1 milliBTC per KB of transaction. Most 'small' transactions are this size. This is 10,000 satoshi. For BRIT we are adding an additional 0.01 milliBTC (1000 satoshi)
@_date: 2014-05-03 13:03:30
MultiBit uses a CLONE of bitcoinj, not the canonical bitcoinj.
Thus there are some extra classes in the clone. This is mainly for historical reasons - they are the Wallet, some extra methods on Transaction and the store/ load code in the MultiBit variant of the protobuf handler.
The code is all derivative of the original Google work so I left the copyright to respect the original author (Mainly Mike Hearn, who isn't actually at google anymore).
You'll be glad to hear that for the next version of MultiBit we use the canonical bitcoinj library, which eliminates all this.

The biggest advantage is having a 12 word seed phrase from which you can generate all your private keys (and hence recover your bitcoins).
Electrum has of course pioneered this and ThomasV has been working on   supporting HD wallets too.
If we do it right it should be possible to use the same 12 word seed phrase in any HD compatible wallet.

Have a chat with him - he is on reddit and there is an Armory subforum on bitcointalk.org here:
@_date: 2014-07-21 09:54:46
Armory is a great wallet don't get me wrong, but not everyone can run it on their machine as it is quite heavy. 
MultiBit will run on a £200 netbook - that's running everything locally ie connecting directly to the Bitcoin network, not using centralised/ federated servers in the background. Your private keys are only stored on your local machine, encrypted if you wish.
@_date: 2015-05-13 07:37:16
There is a blog article on it here:
When a new wallet is created there is a PGP/AES encrypted exchange with the multibit.org server. A (random) selection of addresses is chosen from a large set of addresses for future BRIT payments. These are stored in the wallet so the exchange only happens once.
There is a list of fallback addresses in case the server is down.
We also always add the MultiBit donation address to the list of receive addresses. Any donation to that address in the wallet is used to waive any future BRIT fees. This is to say thanks.
The BRIT code is all open source, MIT licence. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:21:41
This is a subsystem in the next version of MultiBit (MultiBit HD) that we think other developers might find useful.
We are not proposing to charge for the existing codebase
@_date: 2015-05-12 20:40:52
MultiBit HD is BIP 44 compatible - it provides:
+ Trezor wallets i.e. you plug in a Trezor to do your spends and see your transactions in MultiBit HD.
+ a 'soft' BIP 44 compatible wallet for recovery should you lose your Trezor, as you suggest.
We pregenerate addresses (external and internal) in our wallet so as to make the syncing more efficient.
In the latest code (not released yet - it'll go into Release 0.1) if the user generates a new payment request the user always sees the details in the Payments screen (regardless of if they entered anything on the payment request screen). This might have been confusing to the OP - it was added after user feedback from Beta 8 for exactly this reason.
edit: MultiBit HD also provides 'regular' BIP 32 wallet support.

The first one is a bitcoin address - you can look it up on blockchain.info to see what bitcoin is 'stored' at that address.
The second one is most likely a private key.
DO NOT SHOW THIS TO ANYONE.
The private key is used to redeem the bitcoins at that address.
You can create  a wallet at blockchain.info and import the private key into it.

Thanks for the typo spotting - I'll fix that.
For BRIT there are the following steps:
1) The devs produce a list of (thousands) of Bitcoin addresses that they have in their wallets.
2) There's a server on multibit.org that knows this list.
3) Every day a list of "today's addresses" is chosen from that list. Say 50 bitcoin addresses.
4) When a user downloads MBHD and starts it up for the first time it connects to multibit.org and says "I'm a new install of MBHD, and here is a britWalletId, give me today's addresses'.
5) The install of MBHD saves this list of addresses and will use them to pay to, in a random order.
The wallet replay date is used if you, say, lose your laptop and go to another machine and do a restore from your seed phrase. One of the limitations of the SPV model we use is that you have to create all the private keys and then look on the blockchain from a certain date.
We provide the user with this date at wallet creation time but 'just in case' store a copy, anonymously, on the BRIT server. It's not actually to do with micro-payments but helps the user experience so we added it.
edit: the britWalletId - date encountered link is there so that if you have the SAME wallet on a different machine both copies of MBHD will be using the same list of Bitcoin addresses to pay to. This is so that both of them keep in sync and don't try to ask you to pay the same fee twice

MultiBit dev here.
Always sorry to hear if someone has problems using MultiBit.
I have raised the OPs concerns in our MultiBit issues database here:
I've asked the OP some questions in that thread to track down what the problem is.
For other MultiBit users that want to check their private keys:
You can cross check the private keys in your MultiBit wallet against the receiving addresses by using:
Tool | Check private keys.
The help for this utility is here:

Gary is at the Exeter Bitcoin meetup tonight and is giving a demo of our latest build.
We've made a good amount of progress in the last month - quite good fun coding it up but there's still quite a bit to do.
@_date: 2015-05-02 14:08:09
The WalletTool in the Tools package of bitcoinj is a good place to start.
Here's a snippet from the help:
    WalletTool: print and manipulate wallets
    
    Usage: wallet-tool --flags action-name
           wallet-tool action-name --flags
    
    &gt;&gt;&gt; ACTIONS
      dump                 Loads and prints the given wallet in textual form to stdout. Private keys are only printed
                           if --dump-privkeys is specified.
      raw-dump             Prints the wallet as a raw protobuf with no parsing or sanity checking applied.
      create               Makes a new wallet in the file specified by --wallet.
                           Will complain and require --force if the wallet already exists.
                           If --seed is present, it should specify either a mnemonic code or hex/base58 raw seed bytes.
      marry                Makes the wallet married with other parties, requiring multisig to spend funds.
                           External public keys for other signing parties must be specified with --xpubkeys (comma separated).
      add-key              Adds a new key to the wallet, either specified or freshly generated.
                           If --date is specified, that's the creation date.
                           If --unixtime is specified, that's the creation time and it overrides --date.
                           If --privkey is specified, use as a hex/base58 encoded private key.
                           Don't specify --pubkey in that case, it will be derived automatically.
                           If --pubkey is specified, use as a hex/base58 encoded non-compressed public key.
                           If --lookahead-size is specified, pre-generate at least this many keys ahead of where we are.
      add-addr             Requires --addr to be specified, and adds it as a watching address.
      delete-key           Removes the key specified by --pubkey or --addr from the wallet.
      current-receive-addr Prints the current receive address, deriving one if needed. Addresses derived with this action are
                           independent of addresses derived with the add-key action.
      sync                 Sync the wallet with the latest block chain (download new transactions).
                           If the chain file does not exist this will RESET the wallet.
      reset                Deletes all transactions from the wallet, for if you want to replay the chain.    
      send                 Creates and broadcasts a transaction from the given wallet.

You can monitor the progress of the MultiBit HD release that has the Trezor code in it (0.05beta) in our issues tracking database.
The work we've already done is here:
 (112 items as I type)
The work we currently have outstanding is here:
 (12 items)
Integrating Trezor has been a complex task - for instance to do all the low level USB transport Gary Rowe had to write a whole library (multibit-hardware -  - MIT open source so available for everyone now)
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:00:22
It could be something like there is a lock time attached to the transaction (which would mean it wouldn't confirm until sometime in the future). 
It is basically saying make sure you wait for the transaction to confirm before you, say, dispatch any goods.

There's a fee slider to adjust the fee rate in the latest MultiBit Classic version 0.5.19

You could always try moving your wallet/ private keys to blockchain.info:
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:19:40
In the life of MultiBit (i.e from 2011) there's probably a handful of cases like these. If there is damage to the private key bytes (for whatever reason) and there is no other copy available/ backed up then you've lost access to the bitcoins.

We think having funding for the desktop clients helps both the users and the devs in the long run. It will provide funding for support teams etc 
It also provides a better model for scaling bitcoin usage to a wider community.
@_date: 2016-01-04 13:30:35
Have a read of the support note that covers this here:
Also, transaction relay fees have increased recently so make sure you have the latest version of MultiBit Classic from  It's currently at version 0.5.19.
You can also export your private keys and transfer them to blockchain.info if you want. There is a how to here:
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:56:22
~~The older version is most likely the reason why the transaction did not propagate as the minimum relay fee has increased of late.~~ I see your tx did actually confirm.
When importing to blockchain.info make sure you do an export of your private key UNENCRYPTED. It is a radio button on the 'Export private keys' page. It's in the help but easy to miss.
Once you've imported them ok to blockchain.info make sure you secure delete them from your PC to stop anyone else getting them.
You should then get control back of your bitcoin,
Generally now we recommend using [MultiBit HD]( rather than MultiBit Classic as it is easier to use. For instance the sending algorithm is more robust and wallet recovery is simpler as you have a set of 12 wallet words.

There's 0.0584 mBTC remaining as a spendable output. That's 2 USD cent so it won't make you rich but let me know where you want it sent !
For the record, I used MultiBit HD and did a restore using the seed phrase, making sure I restored it as a 'BIP44' seed phrase. Then I just emptied the wallet.

The latest MultiBit Classic release (0.5.19) has a fee slider in Preferences and the default fee rate worked fine.
Older versions set a fee rate that was OK when they were built but is far too low now.
If you are using an old version please upgrade, or move to [MultiBit HD](
@_date: 2015-05-13 07:06:24
Yes we will have to give users feedback on that as it would have consequences as you point out. Thanks for the feedback.
Each payment request in MBHD is intended as a single request for payment from someone for a particular service/ item (hence the labelling and workflow)
@_date: 2016-01-27 16:48:34
How URI handling works is that the operating system intercepts the request and forwards it to whoever is registered to handle it.
Registration varies from OS to OS. Perhaps with a portable version it isn't done automatically.
@_date: 2016-03-04 10:51:08
It depends on the size of the transaction.
 
You can see the size in bytes if you select the transaction and then do 'Show transaction details'.
Once you know the fee per byte then a good reference to see confirmation times is:

Good stuff.
I don't know why they didn't empty the wallet entirely, but it can be tricky to get the exact amount if you are doing it manually.
Anyhow, good to hear that you/ the OP got their cash back.
@_date: 2016-01-24 10:54:27
Nodes have to do a certain amount of work to service a connection (talk to it, send it data, bloom filter for bitcoinj based clients).
A typical node can maintain (IIRC) 120ish connections before maxing out.
So you want to connect to enough nodes that you can verify your transactions are propagating through the network, but not so many that you are consuming more resource (in terms of node connections) that you need.
For instance, with [MultiBit HD]( we try to maintain 10 connections. When a transaction is sent, it is typically transmitted to 5 nodes and then the other 5 are listened to to indicate if the transaction has propagated through the network or not.

There is an explanation of how MultiBit will deal with larger blocks here:
tl;dr It should just work
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:08:45
Rather than me describing what the code does, it would be better for you to have a look yourself. The code is all here:
Have a look at WalletManagerTest
As with all passwords, YOU have to decide on how complicated a password you require.
If your desktop security/ integrity is a worry to you, then I would recommend you purchase a Trezor hardware wallet and use that with MultiBit HD. That keeps the private keys off your desktop.
@_date: 2015-08-29 09:29:49
As per the blog article, this release is mainly small bug fixes.
We also now have a complete Greek translation.
Also we have have had to temporarily drop Tor support (previously in Labs) as it was causing too many error reports for production code.
@_date: 2015-08-02 10:47:34
You can also use the same seed in Lighthouse if you want to try that.
Also, when you do the restore, make sure you have the correct option in the 'What created these wallet words?' question (underneath where you enter the wallet words).
We changed the wallet format in the Beta program so if your wallet is Beta 7 or earlier you need to follow: 
For a regular MultiBit HD wallet just choose the default option:
"MultiBit HD, Lighthouse (BIP 32)"
@_date: 2015-08-19 17:29:26
MultiBit dev here.
For day to day use of [MultiBit HD]( you use an encrypted wallet (a wallet.aes file) and a password. The password is used to create an AES key, which is then used to decrypt the wallet.
If an attacker can get hold of a wallet.aes file and your password then they can spend your bitcoins.
The stack exchange question touches on a slightly different issue. Can you use a wallet.aes file to do a restore ?
Well no, not easily.
In one of the backup files that are used to do a restore there are several files:
+ wallet
+ contacts
+ extra transaction information
+ the backup encryption key, which is then encrypted with a key derived from the password.
Setting up all of these in just the right way for things to work correctly in the future is not simple.
That's why we created the backups in the first place !
The **most** important thing with a deterministic wallet is to write down the wallet words (seed phrase) so that you can easily recover your bitcoins. In the stack exchange question the user did not have this information.
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:43:36
The latest version of MultiBit is 0.5.18
It is available on the  website.
Click on Downloads in the menu bar and scroll down to the 'Releases and signatures' section. There is a link to the MultiBit Classic downloads.
MultiBit HD is purely deterministic so you cannot import random keys into it.
@_date: 2015-08-14 11:59:53
The [MultiBit HD]( UI is much improved over the old Classic version.
Also, MultiBit HD is now fully deterministic so, as long as you write down your wallet words (seed phrase), you can recreate your private keys and recover your bitcoins if you lose your laptop etc.

Bitcoin Core is obviously the granddaddy of Bitcoin wallets but there are a few wallets still existing from 2011:
+ Schildbach wallet - [first bitcointalk post was March 11 2011](
+ Electrum - [first bitcointalk post was November 5th 2011](
+ blockchain.info - [not exactly sure but sometime in 4Q2011](
+ Armory - [first bitcointalk post]( was Jan 3rd 2012 so also would have existed in 2011 too.
+ Instawallet was very commonly used in 2011 but was shut down, only to be reincarnated as the Mycelium back end and subsequently Mycelium the phone app.

Probably easiest just to empty your wallet into Core using the 'Manage wallet | Empty wallet' option.
Anything in particular you do not like about MultiBit HD ?
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:23:02
Correct - we only support the 'Account 1' in myTrezor.com terminology. 
This is due to technical limitations of us connecting directly to Bitcoin Core/ XT nodes. Here is a [technical write up]( It's the section 'Bloom filtering and single HD account support'.
It's a limitation that unfortunately is unlikely to disappear.
In MultiBit HD in the 'Manage wallet | Wallet dashboard | Wallet capabilities' section we describe each type of wallet and what it supports precisely. This is rather technical prose admittedly but there is no other way to say it.

We think hardware wallets work very nicely to protect users' private keys so have emphasised Trezor support.
For a fully decentralised wallet such as MultiBit HD rendezvous (ie where are the other signees?) is tricky to make intuitive. 
In comparision Trezor support is as simple as plug it in.

Saw this in Stony Stratford (north Milton Keynes) this morning.
I looked around for a Bitcoin street dealer but couldn't see one so it's a mystery
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:56:44
It shouldn't be a surprise in that:
+ It's in the T&amp;Cs on the webpage that you have to agree to to download the installer.
+ In the create wizard / start up - it's the first screen and you have to agree to it.
+ If you didn't read either of those, the client fee appears on the Send Confirmation screen every time you do a send. This is together with the miners' fee. I currently have the miners' fee set at 10,000 sat per KB whereas the client fee is 1,000 sat (=0.3 USD cent)

MultiBit HD has a nice feature on the sign and verify options. Once you have created a signature, you can do  'Copy all' to get a Bitcoin signed message in your paste buffer that looks like this:
-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hello world
-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNATURE-----
Version: MultiBit HD (0.1.1)
Comment: 
Address: 16Z6cjUcUvGEHE4AdAhQj5FbH1PLJDbAEg
"signature goes here"
-----END BITCOIN SIGNATURE-----
(extra lines added for reddit formatting)
Then on the 'Verify message' option there is a 'Paste all' where you can paste a Bitcoin signed message and it will parse it and verify it automatically.
@_date: 2016-02-13 10:49:17
It looks like you sent transactions running an older version of MultiBit Classic. The most recent code not only has a fee adjustment slider (in Preferences) but the default fee is higher to cater for changes in relay fees.
If the transactions didn't propagate then:
1) Do a reset blockchains and transactions
2) Make sure your fee setting is appropiate (default is OK at the moment)
3) Send your transactions again

Very interesting comment there runeks. After all, everything costs time and effort. I do not think I would do it for MultiBit but could see using that model for sister products further down the line. MultiBit I think of as 'bootstrap software' i.e. doing it's bit to get the Bitcoin economy established and unstoppable. 
@_date: 2012-04-26 16:38:25
You can now import your blockchain.info wallet backups (including the double encrypted ones) directly into MultiBit. Unfortunately I have to replay the whole blockchain (2 hours on wifi) so it is more a 'get out if jail free' card rather than something you would do day to day. 
@_date: 2012-12-19 13:11:37
The backup files contain the private keys and the keys' creation date only. 
The wallets contain the private keys, addresses, transactions and transaction status. 
There are also info files (one for each wallet) which contain the wallet and address descriptions.

Piuk wrote an import utility for the encrypted blockchain.info wallets and it is included in MultiBit. It is in the Tools | Import Private Keys option. 
You would not want to use it unless you had to as it has to go back to the genesis block but it means your bitcoin are still available if you need them.

I think you would be better off encrypting your private keys before emailing them. Ordinary mail is not secure and emailing your private key in plain text risks it being viewed en route by any intermediate mail server. Any BTC ever put on that that key in the future could be stolen. 
@_date: 2012-12-10 09:45:57

@_date: 2012-09-04 21:56:48
That is an interesting model but to be honest I never intended MultiBit to be commercial software.  I am quite happy for it to be free, as it encourages things like translations and pull requests. 
@_date: 2012-01-25 20:26:11
In the future, unfortunately, people will lose their bitcoin because they exposed their private keys on an unencrypted wifi and someone sniffed their packets. YOU know not to do that, but BTCBIN makes it easier to create bitcoin addresses generally so not everyone will be aware of how important it is to keep their private keys, well, private. 
@_date: 2012-09-04 14:15:11
There are good reasons why Bitcoin software should be open source but it does make commercial software difficult to produce. 
For instance my 'break-even' price for each download of MultiBit is around 50 millis. This would pay my bills. But when you look at how much people donate, it is only about 1 milli per download on average.
I am happy to do it as Bitcoin is awesome, but there must be tonnes of devs who would work on Bitcoin if they could just pay the bills and keep the kids in shoes. 
@_date: 2012-11-08 16:21:28
Once you have got your private keys . . .
There is help on importing a single private key into MultiBit here:
To do several you just need more rows in the key import file. The only non-obvious thing is the 'birthdate of key' mentioned. This needs to be earlier than the first transaction in your wallet. 
Also: if you just want your bitcoin, can you simply send the bitcoin from the Satoshi client to your new wallet in Electrum / MultiBit ? I think you can send in the Satoshi client as long as you have one confirmation, don't think it has to have caught up the blockchain completely. 
@_date: 2012-06-27 08:08:24
My brother and I ran a small mail redirection company for several years. 
Surprisingly, even with bitcoin as your payment method, your biggest problem will be: credit card fraud. 
Whilst the bulk of clients are genuine a proportion are after a delivery address they can use for items bought with stolen credit cards. You soon get into an 'identity validation' arms race. We started asking for scans of passports at client sign up - after a few months the passport images we received all started having remarkably similar file names. Obviously fake. 
You can soon start having letters from debt collectors and even bailiffs at the door. In the end we decided the headaches were not worth the profit.
Don't let it stop you though - I just wanted to give you a heads up so you build in anti-fraud measures right from the start. 
@_date: 2012-11-05 20:01:16
You want the device that does the signing to show the user:
1) The address being sent to
2) The amount
and then give the user the chance to Confirm/ Cancel.
It has to be on the user's device otherwise an attacker can spoof the display.

Yes it would be in Bitcoin Android Wallet also as that is based on bitcoinj too. 
If you notice in the latest MultiBit/ bitcoinj code it keeps track of how many network peers each transaction has been seen by. I am hoping that what I call the 'Boomerang Rule' will enable your change to be treated as spendable immediately (rather than waiting for a confirmation).
The Boomerang Rule is that if you transmit a transaction out via one peer and you see it come back via (at least one) other peer you can be pretty sure it is wellformed, got to the network, the peer 'likes' it etc and can treat the change as immediately spendable. It is a heuristic rather than an absolute rule but I will probably try it out before Xmas to see if it reliable.

This is going to be very useful for lightweight clients. 
You set a filter on the server end of your network connection. It then filters the data it sends you to just what is important to you (together with some false positives that help privacy). 
Rather than downloading, say, 500KB a block you will just get probably a few KB with the header in and your relevant transactions. 
It needs support added to both the client libraries (eg bitcoinj) and bitcoind for it all to work.

@_date: 2012-07-09 07:33:57
As I understand it, OpenPay is primarily software that bridges the EuroPay Mastercard Visa (EMV) network to the Bitcoin network. The smart card has a Bitcoin private key on it that signs a transaction for the amount requested by the store. You have a PIN.
The network routes the payment request through the EMV network, through the OpenPay bridge, to the Bitcoin network. You then have software (or sign up at a service provider) that recognises the payment request and constructs the transaction for the amount. This transaction then gets returned to the card for signing. To get a card you either self-issue i.e. program one up with your own card reader, or get one from a service provider. 
For reading magnetic stripe cards (for the US) it needs software added to the card readers in the store so that they can support OpenPay (a bit like support for, say, Amex cards). AFAIK for Chip &amp; Pin cards the existing card readers can route the payment request as is but it does need an Issuer Identification Number (IIN) for that routing to work - these are issued to an organisation, hence the author setting up the Open Payment Alliance.
There is also support for:
+ conversion of your local currency payment to bitcoins
+ automatic 'top-up' of your bitcoins if you do not have enough to pay (via an exchange)
+ the store can keep the payments as bitcoin or have them converted to their local currency

Blockchain.info now imports MultiBit private key export files.
You can have your blockchain.info wallet and a MultiBit wallet with the same private keys. You can spend or receive in either and the other updates at the next block. 
Effectively each is a 'live backup' of the other. 
1) Create a wallet in MultiBit - add however many addresses you want. 
2) Run "Tools | Export private keys". 
3) Copy the contents of the generated key file.
4) Go into the blockchain.info wallet 'Import / Export | Import Wallet" option and paste. Press the 'Import Wallet' button. 
5) Sometimes you have to close the tab, reopen and relogin to refresh the BTC totals. (I have mentioned this to piuk). 
There are a few things to be careful of - for instance accidental double spends - but as long as you know what you are doing it works fine.

The essence of fractional reserve banking is to lend out a deposit but for the person making the deposit to still have access to it. Voila - the money supply increases. The main problem for the bank is the risk of a bank run. This is when the depositors take out their money faster than the bank can call in its loans - it is the risk caused by maturity transformation (borrow short, lend long). Without a central bank to print you would have to have some sort of interbank lending so as to prevent bank runs. Time deposits (say 1 year certificate of deposits) would be quite doable. A bitcoin bank could make money on the delta between loan rate and CD rate but thus would be full reserve banking. I think in the days of the pre Fed gold standard banks would be about 20% backed ie 5x leverage and you could probably do that with bitcoin.

Congrats to the Electrum team on the release of their v1.0. The new 'mini-mode' is well worth checking out.
On the MultiBit development side, in addition to the live release on  there is also an alpha of the GUI that supports encrypted wallets at  . 
(It is still in alpha as it still needs test and integration into bitcoinj but I doubt the GUI will change much.) If you would like to help out with some informal user testing please have a look - readme.txt is important.
Screenshot: 
Also, if you are on a slow connection or have a data download limit you might want to check out the 'useCacheManager' option I have added to the alpha. This caches the blocks locally and is handy if you are importing keys often - it is 20 times faster on my machine. It is described in the 'configuration.txt' in the install directory. This will probably be a temporary thing - Matt Corallo is doing some great work on server side Bloom filters which I am hoping will completely replace this when it is ready.
I thought I would put it in though as it give more options to bitcoin users which is all to the good.

MBHD is now fully deterministic so all private keys are derived from a set of wallet words (BIP 32 / 39). This is the same derivation as wallets such as Lighthouse. 
The Trezor private keys are stored in the Trezor device so MBHD does not need to know those.
Bitcoinj is the library talking to the Bitcoin network. It is very solid now IMHO. Dealing with the Bitcoin network directly can be tricky as you cannot assume that a Core node will either stay up or play nice but bitcoinj handles this robustly, swopping one node for another if it stops talking.
In this beta I have upped the number of peers MBHD makes from 6 to 8 which makes a noticable difference on Send responsiveness. Try it out and judge for yourself.

To answer your question: Electrum uses a deterministic wallet. 
From the seed it can generate all your private keys and hence addresses.
It then asks the stratum server(s) it is connected to for the transactions for those addresses and recreates your wallet.

The 'HD' in the name is because it uses hierarchical deterministic address generation - like lots of other wallets now.
Change addresses are also generated as well as receiving addresses.
The main way addresses on the blockchain can be linked (which applies to both HD and Classic) is that all the transaction inputs are signed by the same entity i.e. YOU, so you've demonstrated that you control all the inputs.

Hi 
I am the lead dev on MultiBit.
It does use bitcoinj for the heavy lifting onto the bitcoin network - this the same library as Android bitcoin wallet yes.   Andreas (the dev on this) has made my work much easier by being the first to create a UI using it.
bitcoinfan&lt; you are right - it uses the Simplified Payment Verification model and only downloads the blockchain.   It does not mine nor offer blocks to other peers.   It needs Satoshi client nodes as the backbone of the bitcoin network.
distortednet &lt; MultiBit has been a prototype on the bitcoinj mailing list for a month or so and I did write a UI guideline to get input from the list.   I didn't post on reddit though - perhaps that was someone else on the mailing list.   The google doc with the initial design is in the multibit.org FAQ page (the graphics are a bit out of date but the overall design is the same).
I am using this thread on bitcointalk.org to coordinate the progress on this project:
so please look in on there from time to time if you are interested in how it is developing.
If you use github and are interested in the commits as they go in then you can watch:
Please do have a look at the code - the codebase is still relatively young so the more eyes looking through it the better.

It is early days for MultiBit yet so I have labeled it as 'experimental' code for the moment.   There are still a few things to go in before it is bullet proof enough for the general user.
Please do try it out and post your feedback (preferably on the bitcointalk thread as I monitor that more - though I will check this thread too).   All the dev has been on a Mac so I am especially interested if there are any Windows or Linux quirks I have missed.
It is targeted at the general user so I have tried to simplify the language used as much as possible though that is a bit of a challenge - bitcoins are definitely a bit geeky.   :-)

KeepKey's software is very similar to Trezor's.
Both have the capability in the firmware for the user to set a password that is used in addition to the seed phrase to calculate the addresses.
Some software (myTrezor, Electrum) supports the usage of this extra password but MultiBit HD does not.
We keep things simple with MultiBit HD and there is one wallet only per Trezor or KeepKey.
We actually don't plan to support the seed phrase + password configuration as we cannot support password recovery for that password and if people lose it they lose their bitcoins.
A single wallet contains many private keys and hence you can have many addresses in a single wallet.

MultiBit Classic shows this message if it receives a transaction with an nLockTime that has been set. This can be used to have a transaction that will only confirm after a certain block height.
As it is an unusual structure MultiBit Classic shows a warning.
If it is confirmed on the blockchain it means the nLockTime has passed and the transaction is fine. It can be spent as normal.
For instance, if you did a localbitcoins transaction and saw this warning you'd want to wait until the transaction confirmed before handing over your cash.

There is some help here:
@_date: 2015-10-13 19:53:13
You get this message when the transaction has a non missing nLockTime:
Class: org.multibit.viewsystem.swing.view.panels.ShowTransactionsPanel
Lines: 702 to 705
                    if (transaction.getLockTime() &gt; 0) {
                    // Non standard transaction.
                    transactionTrustfulness=MultiBit.getController().getLocaliser().getString("multiBitFrame.status.notConfirmedAndNotStandard") + ".";
                    }
The reason for this message appearing in MultiBit is: 
Say you accept a transaction in person but the nLockTime is a year in the future. That transaction is not going to make it into ANY block for a year. Whilst the transaction is strictly speaking valid it is almost certainly NOT what you were expecting, hence the message.
edit1: fixed formatting
edit2: if the transaction has made it successfully into a block then the nLockTime must have passed
@_date: 2015-10-18 21:31:39
It indicates that transaction is 'dead'. Another transaction was mined onto a block with the same inputs.
it's the transaction malleability attack most likely
@_date: 2015-10-14 09:45:19
That's a fork so you'd need to co tact the MultiDoge devs

Yeah logically you are correct - the code's all open source so have a look.

Have they blocked the Bitcoin network on port 8333 ?
If not, then if they can get a copy of [MultiBit HD]( they can use bitcoin. It connects directly to Bitcoin Core/ XT nodes.
The Schildbach wallet on Android and Breadwallet on IOS also connect directly to the Bitcoin network
@_date: 2015-11-05 22:37:45
 Glad you managed to get your wallet in a good state.
The problem isn't actually with the encrypting/ decrypting of the wallet, rather transaction malleability is causing us some problems with internal consistency of the wallet data.
(Specifically: Transaction outputs used by transaction inputs don't match and the wallet doesn't load).
As mentioned in other threads the workaround is to restore one of the automatically generated backups and let it sync.
We have various fixes in the pipeline, namely:
+ only allowing transactions with LowS signatures in the wallet
+ giving better feedback as to if it is the password that is wrong or the wallet is not loading for another reason
+ if the wallet is inconsistent at load then MultiBit HD will automatically do a wallet repair which will resync the wallet to the Bitcoin network.
[MultiBit HD]( has been out since June 2015 and the code is relatively stable now. If you are still using the old MultiBit Classic I recommend [you consider upgrading](
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:21:06
Glad the recovery process worked for you.
I think it will be quite common for people to have the same HD wallet 'in two places'. It should just work with sends and receives being seen by both wallets. 
There is a fixed word list yes of 2048 words (2^11). With 12 words you have 128 bits of entropy. (There are some checksum bits). As long as you are using a good random number generator you have a key size of 2^128 for an attacker to search.
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:30:02
With MultiBit HD we have improved the exchange rate support.
When you request bitcoins from someone it stores:
+ the amount in bitcoin
+ the fiat equivalent
+ the exchange rate used
+ the exchange (e.g. Kraken) used
Then when you receive payment it records the same information at time of receipt.
You can see all this information when you double click on a transaction in the Payments screen - there's a little wizard that pops up.
When you export the data you get all this information in CSV files. We do this because we expect some people will need to work out the cost basis at time of invoicing, and some will need it at time of receipt of transaction. And for capital gains tax you'd probably need both. By recording both we give people the opportunity to work things out.
MultiBit HD is still in beta but you try out the installer for yourself at

We don't support having passwords to 'multiplex' wallets on Trezor / KeepKey. This is because we cannot offer password recovery for that password (like we do in MultiBit HD for your regular wallet password).
@_date: 2015-10-11 11:14:03
Disclosure: I am biased as I am one of the authors.
[MultiBit HD]( is designed to be straightforward to use so it is pretty easy to pick up.
The Trezor support (and KeepKey support in the upcoming version v0.1.4) is as integrated as we can make it.
Recently I paid a BIP70 payment request ( with MultiBit HD + Trezor and it was genuinely good fun to:
1) Click on the donate link
2) MultiBit HD opens, syncs and then you get a little alert about the 
payment and do you want to pay it. Click yes.
3) Get a send confirmation screen, click yes and then see the transaction on the Trezor screen
4) Confirm on the Trezor.
5) The transaction gets sent and then you can type in a message directly to Eclipse and they send you a confirmation.
I cannot do that with my fiat online banking !

The code snippet is pretty clear: 
If the nLockTime is greater than zero you will get that message.

In MultiBit HD (in Tools | Labs) you can switch on Tor support. This uses a library called Orchid.
Whilst not a panacea,  this does have the advantage of encrypting your local traffic. Thus if you are on a public network someone packet sniffing won't be able to parse your bitcoin traffic.
If someone can link your traffic after it comes out of an exit node to you it won't help though.
@_date: 2015-10-16 13:01:25
And if that doesn't work, then you can move your wallet to blockchain.info if you like. There is a how-to here
@_date: 2015-10-10 12:02:56
The approach most wallets take is to make all the transaction info available for export, typically into CSV files.
For instance in [MultiBit HD]( you can do an export on the Payments screen and get CSV files with:
+ payments you requested
+ payments other people requested
+ transaction details
You get transaction details, the amount in bitcoin and exchange rates (plus the exchange you used for the lookup).
The reason wallets do this is that the rules for tax liability vary enormously across the globe - it's not practical to integrate it.

You are pretty much describing the architecture used by Electrum.
The local client connects to nodes that efficiently store the UTXO set but all that signing is done locally.
Rereading your post you are proposing the tx is constructed on the server, but I'm pretty sure Electrum does that locally.
Edit: Note that Electrum independently performs SPV checks so it doesn't trust their UTXO servers
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:41:39
Excellent site for BIP32/39 address generation. Use it offline if you are generating private keys.
@_date: 2015-03-14 17:33:30
No - it bundles a library (called Orchid) that implements all the Tor goodness itself.
@_date: 2015-03-23 11:17:45
MultiBit HD supports:
+ BIP39 12,18,24 words. No passphrase encoding. BIP32 wallet with key derivation m/0h. Only the first account.
+ BIP39 + a Trezor 'hard' wallet. This is support for an actual Trezor device you plug in,
That is BIP44 HD key structure (m/44h/0h/0h). Only the first account (what's called 'Account 1' on myTrezor.com).
+ BIP39 + BIP44 'soft' wallet. That is so that if you lose your Trezor you can restore to a wallet on your desktop to recover your bitcoin.
Note that the HD key structure is important. For instance Mycelium uses BIP44 - the same as Trezor. If you try to restore a mnemonic phrase to a wallet using a different path derivation you won't see your addresses.
Think of the mnemonic phrase as the location of particular junction in a big city, say New York. If you know the mnemonic phrase you can get to the junction. The HD path derivation is the direction you look at that junction to see your private keys and addresses.
HD wallets are unfortunately a bit complicated interoperability wise.
I think the easiest way to summarise it is for each wallet team to document and test:
"If you have your bitcoin in &lt;our wallet&gt; then you can/cannot restore to wallet &lt;their wallet&gt;"
@_date: 2015-11-01 17:17:51
Isn't it already in :
If so, then I suggest doing a Tools | Reset blockchain and transactions to resync to the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-10-16 12:59:26
It means the transaction was not successfully transmitted to the bitcoin network.
By resetting the transactions, you sync your wallet to what is on the blockchain. You can then resend the transaction.
@_date: 2015-02-12 14:38:52
When you first start up MultiBit HD you see a 'Welcome' wizard.
This has the usual 'Hello' screen, a 'please accept our licence' screen , a language chooser screen.

Already raised and replied to on the MultiBit classic issues database:
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:11:28
Your local copy of MultiBit HD interacts with multibit.org as follows:
+ At start up it does what we call a 'BRIT exchange' to check the payment addresses and to get a sync date (It only does this once).
 
+ At start up it performs a check on a file we have on our server 'updates.xml' to see if there is a later version. (You are then given the option to download the new version - There are no pushed auto-updates).
+ The help is also hosted on multibit.org (with a local copy to fallback to if there any problems with our servers).
All the Bitcoin network interaction is done via the Bitcoin network nodes it randomly chooses when it connects.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:39:28
The code is open source so you can build it however you want.
@_date: 2015-10-11 11:58:31
That is correct.
We decided to not support it as there is no way to have passphrase recovery for your Trezor passphrase. 
Passphrases are unfortunately imperfect - with a Trezor passphrase if you forget it your bitcoins are unrecoverable.
edit: MultiBit HD does support your Trezor PIN.
(We have password recovery for regular MultiBit HD wallets. Just type in your wallet words and it tells you your password).

Have a read of: 
How our micropayment system (BRIT) works is that ANY payment to a set of addresses in a MultiBit HD wallet counts as fee payment.
We plan to add the MultiBit donation address to this set of addresses.
Thus if you kindheartedly donate, say, 10 millis (1,000,000 sat) then you won't have any BRIT fee transaction outputs added for 1000 sends.
@_date: 2015-02-12 22:48:00
We do not plan to no, mainly on simplicity grounds.
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:46:49
MultiBit HD is still in beta yes - we only advise people to try it out with a few millis.
We will be running MultiBit HD on  until we've had a 'reasonable' number of people using it and ironed out the inevitable glitches. 
Once we've finished off our "Release 0.1" work and have seen enough downloads we will swop " to " and make it our primary offering.

@_date: 2015-10-13 15:22:04
If you delete the request the private key is still in the wallet so you can still receive bitcoins to it.
As you'll typically create a new address everytime you want someone to send bitcoin to you, the amount can be used as a reminder of how much fiat or bitcoin you requested. (Also the exchange rate is stored which is useful for accounts).
There isn't a list of just receive addresses anywhere but if you double click on a transaction you can see all the details, including the original payment request.
You can also search by pretty much anything in the search bar on the Payments screen which is very handy when you have a lot of transactions / addresses
@_date: 2016-05-25 14:53:55
The client (as in MultiBit HD client) has the public key for encrypting traffic to multibit.org so it is out in the field in many thousands of installations.
All the PGP encrypted traffic is also transfered via SSL. KeepKey LLC has a new EV SSL cert for when they roll out their version of the multibit.org website.
They could update the PGP encryption key if they want at the next upgrade. As there is no forced update with MultiBit they'll want to keep the extant key for decrypting older clients's traffic.
@_date: 2016-05-25 15:18:43
The KeepKey hardware wallet integration in MultiBit HD is pretty seamless.
Software engineering is incredibly expensive and so buying an extant product can be a good option.
KeepKey LLC have committed to keeping the codebase MIT licence so anyone will still be able to fork it.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:51:51
The version check runs once when you open it yes.
This is pretty standard in software now - it's actually implemented in the installer code - we did not write it.
Generally people don't check for new software so you need a way to get bug fixes out to people.
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:51:56
We've changed the installer to use Install4j, which is a very complete installer generator. 
It is a bit unconventional yes - delivering nice signed binaries across Win/ Mac/ Linux can involve compromises.
Install4j very nicely bundles a Java runtime with our app and gives a clean "version check and download update" facility.

With MultiBit HD we store:
+ The amount you requested in bitcoin, the fiat equivalent, the exchange rate and exchange used at the time of request.
+ The amount you actually received in bitcoin, the fiat equivalent at time of receipt (with the effective exchange rate and exchange).
If you double click on a payment in the Payments screen you see a little wizard with all this and more.
The export gives you all your payment request details and actual payments, together with transaction ids and addresses so you can match them up.
You can also attach private notes and a public QR code label to every payment request.

In the BRIT system we know very little - the identifier we use is used only for that single purpose and is not tied to your IP address. The messages between you and our server are PGP encrypted inside SSL for extra protection.
Bitcoin has matured now and development costs money. We want to be upfront with what we are doing. All of BRIT is open source, including the server side code.
All the MultiBit HD code is open source (except for our copyrighted icons) so people are free to change the code if they want to.
@_date: 2015-10-16 13:11:58
It's because of the 'reset to 2 days before' most likely.
A transaction output EARLIER than that will have been marked as spent (by the transaction that did not make it to the network).
That's why we dropped the date chooser from the reset page - the safest thing to do is reset the whole wallet from the very first transaction.
The installers for MultiBit Classic are here:
We actually recommend people to use [MultiBit HD]( rather than Classic but perhaps leave that for another day.

Yes - it is in the licence/ T&amp;Cs here :
For every send from MultiBit HD we charge 1000 satoshis. As they are small amounts we bundle them up and add an extra output every 20 sends or so.
The send confirm screen describes what the miner fee and the client/ developer fee are.

An installation of either MultiBit or Electrum is about 10 MB. 
You could install either in a Trucrypt hidden volume and run it locally. 
That would mean the executable, wallet and all the logs were in the hidden volume.
Of course if the attacker knows from other means, eg by blockchain analysis, that you have a hidden wallet then they can just perform a rubber hose attack on you until you tell them

Hi Animazing, 
I think the OP is referring to OSX Mountain Lion. By default it wants the app to be signed by an app developer certificate/ license. (This costs cash but I think I will probably get one). There is a how to to get round it here:  but it is not an ideal user experience.
Signing your app with a Mac cert does mean you can get it into the Mac App store which would be a bonus.
I think Win 8 is similar but haven't used it yet.

Hi Ian,
Thanks for your comment, which is spot on.
At the moment I am deliberately NOT trying to push MultiBit as it does not (yet) have encrypted wallets. These are essential in my opinion but it has taken longer than I expected to get it all done. It is pretty close now. Once that is out the door then a site refresh (adding comments such as yours) is in order. 
That is the main reason we are thinking about the site now.

Much as I love my niece I don't think she is the 'target market' for Bitcoin yet. If I start talking about 'Bitcoin' to her I can tell she just wants to run away as quickly as possible.

@_date: 2013-02-02 22:31:14
You won't have the transactions that happened before the date so your wallet won't be consistent. Best to avoid this. 
The private key export files are primarily to backup the MultiBit wallets - it works out the private key creation date when it outputs them. Using them to import your own private key is ok but you need to get it right. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 14:21:04
It is mainly due to the economics of Bitcoin and open source software. There is effectively a subsidy in Bitcoin (the coinbase transaction) that goes entirely to the miners. This has driven a huge amount of effort in ASICs etc. None of this gets redirected to any other area of Bitcoin development.
Imagine you were going for a job interview to write an open source Bitcoin wallet.
+ The skillset you need is pretty high.
+ There is no pay.
+ The work is difficult and if you get it wrong people lose money.
+ It'll take you months/ years.
+ You'll most likely end up doing all the documentation, testing and support yourself.
Logically speaking no-one would take this job.
@_date: 2013-08-03 09:14:46
Good that the OP has their problem fixed.
They ask: 'whom to ask when things like this happen ?'. 
There is a step-by-step support page here:
It covers the most common gotchas - the first one listed called 'Fast fixes' would have got their wallet back in order.
Also, in the MultiBit help (which is available from within MultiBit and is also on the website) are explanations for:
+ what the transaction icons mean
+ what 'Available to spend' means
+ support notes (one of which is titled 'I sent bitcoin FROM MultiBit but they are stuck' which would be applicable here).
There is also a step-by-step guide of how to transfer your wallet to blockchain.info if that is what you want to do.
As to the root cause of the poor transaction propagation (which caused the unconfirmed transaction) there are 2 most likely reasons:
1) a bad/ intermittent network connection. If you restart MultiBit (once you have fixed your internet connection) it retransmits the transaction.
2) earlier versions of MultiBit only had a simple fee structure. This has now been improved and it also takes into account new network rules for dust outputs.
If you are still using an old version of MultiBit I recommend updating to the current one on the  website.
tl;dr Have a read of the Support page at  Please keep your MultiBit up to date.

As prof7bit eloquently explains, the "File | Close Wallet" simply closes the wallet and is non-destructive. You use "File | Open Wallet" to open it again.
The default directory where wallets are stored varies from operating system to operating system. You can see where this is by opening MultiBit and viewing the Messages tab. The very first line is something like:
The user data directory is "/Users/jim/Library/Application Support/MultiBit".
This is where your wallet is saved by default.

Sorry to hear about your loss btcdamn2. 
Reading through all your posts I see that you used the MultiBit File | Delete to delete the wallet you created. Unfortunately in this scenario this is a secure delete. It overwrites all the wallet contents with nonsense data before deleting the file. This is done to stop an attacker recovering the file and reading your private keys but in this case means even if you recover the file it won't help you. The File | Delete also done the same to the rolling wallet backup for the same reasons. 
It does not help you unfortunately but in the latest code (v0.4.23) the change is sent to the SECOND address in the wallet (if it exists) rather than the first. This is so that change goes to one of the imported keys. Also in the (test) encrypted wallet code when you do an import there is an encrypted timestamped private key export file created. The File | Delete does not touch these files. 
@_date: 2013-02-02 21:48:50
In the private key import files you can also supply a 'private key creation date'. MultiBit will then only sync from then, rather than going back to the genesis block. This saves a lot of time. 
For the exact format of the date, the easiest is to do an private key export of an existing wallet and have a look at the file in a text editor. There is a comment in the top describing the exact date format. 
The date does not have to be exact, it just needs to be before the first transaction for that key.

When you create a MultiBit wallet using the 'File | New Wallet' menu option you can save it in any folder you like. You could also access the wallet in your Truecrypt container directly using the 'File | Open Wallet' menu option. The latest version of MultiBit (v0.5.9rc1) also has a 'File | Close Wallet' option.
The location of the wallet is stored in the multibit.properties in the %USER%\AppData\Roaming\Multibit directory and it will use that path at startup to find the wallet.
If your Truecrypt container was not mounted you would get an error on startup to say that the wallet could not be found but MultiBit would open your other wallets. Thus an attacker who could not mount your Truecrypt container would not be able to see the contents of the wallet (They would know it existed however).
If you wanted to hide the existence of the Truecrypt wallet then you could install MultiBit in the Truecrypt container as well and run it in 'portable' mode - similar to this note on installing in a USB drive:
An installed MultiBit (the 0.5.9rc1 version) is only 10 or 11 MB + add a few MB more for logs, wallets etc - let's say 20 MB in total. You could easily put one installed in your regular Truecrypt volume and one in the hidden volume too should you wish.

They aren't out yet but a dedicated hardware wallet like Trezor would be useful to you.
For day to day work you would not need a password, as pressing the authorisation button on the device is the equivalent.
There is a PIN (to protect against a thief using it) but you can switch this off if you keep the device physically safe.
The wallet recovery phrase - which is 12, 18 or 24 words - is too long for the average human to remember so writing it down is going to be the best way to keep it safe.
Hopefully drugs companies will finally produce something to keep the signs of alzheimers at bay for you.

The server code is open source. There are multiple servers running (about half a dozen I think) for resilience.  The important thing is that the private keys are only known locally ie the server does NOT know your private keys. The servers keep an up to date copy of the blockchain so they can do the 'heavy lifting' rather than the client.

The choice of library used for the network code was the root cause of this limitation.

Yeah, if you open one of the backup wallets in MultiBit it considers it to be a 'primary' wallet (i.e. it must be important because the user opened it). So it starts backing that up as well.

@_date: 2013-12-19 19:49:05
Yes you are correct.
If your wallet is unencrypted then the backups are unencrypted and stored in the 'wallet-unenc-backup' directory.
Then, when you add a password ALL your unencrypted backups are encrypted with your password and the old, unencrypted, copies are secure deleted.
Then all new (encrypted) backups go into the wallet-backup directory.
That way there are no unencrypted copies sat around on your disk.

The wallets that you can see in your directory with the date+time in the name are rolling backup wallets. Every time the wallet writes to disk it keeps a copy of the original. It only keeps a single copy - it secure deletes older ones. This is just in case the power goes off suddenly when writing to disk - it uses the rolling backup for automatic wallet recovery.
The backup wallets are "one step" out of date so it could be that the one you have open is missing a transaction that is in your main wallet. As Gary mentions: a "Tools | Reset blockchain and transactions" should fix this.
In your list of files you have a wallet name with TWO dates in. Once you open a backup wallet using "File | Open" MultiBit promotes it to be a "primary" wallet rather than just a backup. It thus starts backing up THAT wallet too.
Normally you don't have to worry about the rolling backup wallets - they are there for your protection more than anything.

Disclosure: I am one of the MultiBit devs.
The OP is correct that there is an element of trust between the user of any bitcoin software and its author. 
The most important question of any wallet is: 
Who has access to the private keys ?
With MultiBit your wallet is on your desktop and when you encrypt it only you know the password you have used.
Nonetheless, there is still trust required of the developer. For instance with MultiBit you are downloading and installing code that I have written. How do you know what you are running ? There are a few ways:
1) It is open source - you can see every commit that goes into the codebase. 
2) You can build it yourself if you want to. 
3) You can reverse engineer the code to see that it matches what is on the codebase.
The code is signed with my PGP key and for Windows and Mac there are extra signatures (authenticode and a Mac developer id, respectively). This is so that you can check the code is genuine. (This does not actually protect against a rogue developer but protects against other attacks).
There are some other things done which help protect the userbase. For instance with MultiBit there is no automatic update so that you cannot have a new version forced upon you.  This uses 'crowdtesting' and social networks as an extra layer of protection. If a single person gets their BTC stolen by a trojan version of any wallet it will be at the top of reddit within 5 minutes. No-one will download a copy of the new code until it is sorted out.
There have actually been trojan copies of MultiBit (on name squatting websites etc) and you can see the number of downloads of the genuine MultiBit drop dramatically whilst people waited for a few days "just in case".
All the wallet developers for the main wallets are named people i.e. no-one uses pseudonyms. One of the reasons I go to Bitcoin conferences (in addition to them being great fun) is so that people can see who I am and judge for themselves if I am trustworthy.
@_date: 2013-04-04 09:25:31
Yes. You'll always get one created whenever you do anything to the wallet in the future (to backup the wallet) but if you have lots cluttering up your directory you can tidy them up.

If you look at the lite clients they use a variety of techniques to manage the blockchain. For instance in MultiBit the techniques used are:
1) Use block headers instead of full blocks (for the old part of the blockchain).
2) Include the headers only blockchain in the client download so users have it at startup.
3) Top up the headers only blockchain with fastcatchup when the user first starts the app (very quick download speeds).
4) Filter the transactions and only store what is relevant to the wallets.
The filtering of transactions is currently done in MultiBit, but bitcoind-v0.8.0rc1 has the capability of filtering on the server side. Once this is rolled out and the consequent changes are done to the clients this will speed things up and decrease the bandwidth used. (Currently being tested - see  )

If you have the private key you can derive the address from it - the private key is the crucial bit of information.
RE: backing up and restoring. 
What I normally do is:
+ add 'more than enough' receiving addresses in the wallet I am using. (You can add them in bulk now in the 'Create new receiving addresses' dialog).
+ when you create new private keys MultiBit now automatically creates a timestamped, encrypted private key export file so your new keys are in there.
+ then in case of hard disk failure etc, copy the .wallet, .info and the .key files (all of them) to a couple of other locations/devices.
If you create more receiving addresses (ie more private keys) you have to repeat the backup.
That's what I do but there are lots of ways to do it.

The wallet with the number in is a rolling backup. The number is a timestamp. Whenever MultiBit writes to disk it copies the existing wallet to the backup first. It only keeps one level of backup. It is mainly in case you lose power suddenly and the write fails. It is used to automatically recover your wallet. 
You can normally ignore the rolling backup file but it is pretty useful sometimes.
Yes- The wallet files contain roughly the same information as the bitcoind wallet.dat but are not compatible.

I thought I would describe how I backup my MultiBit wallets as you might want to do something similar.
I have a few Truecrypt volumes at various locations that I use for backups.
The top level directory is:
* walletBackups
Then if today I want to backup a wallet called 'saving' I would create a new directory:
* walletBackups/2013-11-05
and in there I would copy:
 * saving.wallet
 * saving.info
 * saving-data (and all its contents)
I don't delete earlier backups (They are only small. You do not want to delete the wrong thing by accident)
This way I can open the file saving.wallet directly in any copy of multibit and check everything is ok.
With the latest code with encrypted wallets you also get automatic export of the private keys in the key-backup directory. If you have an unencrypted wallet you have to do this manually using the 'Tools | Export private keys' menu option.
This help topic has a bit more on wallet backups:
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:45:19
You cannot specify which address(es) you send from but you can specify whichever address you like to send to. These are regular transactions so appear on the blockchain and have a fee.

Yes it covers 2-4. 
For 1 - backups - with encrypted wallets it now automatically creates encrypted, timestamped exports of your private keys whenever you create more. You can use these to recreate the essentials of your wallet with an 'Import Private Keys'. You still need to copy these backups somewhere safe yourself though.

The Electrum team don't provide a site with download stats (to my knowledge) but if you look at the Alexa stats for electrum.org here:
they look pretty similar to the multibit.org ones here:
My guess is that Electrum's download figures are about the same as MultiBit's - which are about 1000 a day currently: 
For comparison, Bitcoin-QT downloads are currently about 8000 a day: 
And blockchain.info is signing up about 3000 new wallets a day:
There are obviously duplicates and people upgrading, but that is a total of about 13,000 new Bitcoin wallets/ downloads every single day (And that's not including other wallet offerings and exchange accounts so the real figure is higher).

It looks from the comments that you have it sorted.
I just wanted to mention that you can use your private key backup to recreate your wallet.
To do this you create a new wallet and import the private key file. It then resyncs your wallet to get all the transactions.
You do lose your labels but all your BTC would be there.

I would not try too hard. 
Just say that it is pretty useful Internet money and that you are happy to use it. 
If your family member thinks it is made out of stinky blue cheese from the planet Jupiter that is up to them. 
After all, what kind of self respecting Ponzi tells other people 'if you are not comfortable with XYZ, don't use it' ?
Bitcoin is doing pretty well all on its own.

MultiBit connects to the bitcoind servers in the Bitcoin network to receive and transmit transactions.
The MultiBit wallets you can export the private keys and they are in the WIF format. You can import those into pretty much everything.

Some projects have more of an emphasis on documentation. 
MultiBit has extensive tooltips, as does Armory. 
In MultiBit there is also context sensitive help with a built in Help reader. The help is onlne here:

Once TrueCrypt mounts a volume (whether normal or hidden) it looks like a normal drive. 
You can install MultiBit into any drive and run everything locally. The how-to notes are here:
These were written for installing it onto a USB drive but the same applies for a TrueCrypt mounted drive.
The whole installation (with blockchain) is about 50 MB.

Looks cleaner than the previous version.
A few comments:
+ Your date format is US based - mm/dd/yyyy rather than dd/mm/yyyy as in the UK. I always use, say,  12 Mar 2013 to avoid the issue and avoid having to have both a US locale and a UK locale.
There is a nice feature in Andreas's Bitcoin Wallet where if the transaction is *today* the time is shown, but if it is yesterday or earlier then the date is shown.
+ The currency symbol's position can vary from prefix and suffix for each currency - I think $10 is more common than 10$ for USD. 
What is the QR code shown next to the balance exactly ?
