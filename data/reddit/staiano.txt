But but, you're not Al Gore???

I'm getting one for someone else.
@_date: 2012-08-01 03:40:07
I did not see those.  I'll try to check it out.  I am just concerned that a tangible coin/note can cause more problems versus a throw-away item like a matchbook. 
@_date: 2012-07-09 21:26:51
Yeah I got that but I started reading the comments and then clicked on your first.
@_date: 2012-07-09 21:02:04
As opposed to wall street which is a visible ponzi scheme?
@_date: 2012-08-01 02:41:01
But couldn't that be harder to manufacture?
@_date: 2012-07-10 02:54:25
I can see your points but I don't agree 100%.  I will agree on the tax structure being a problem for sure.

I wasn't even thinking about the Federal Reserve printing money at will.  Rather it seems the average guy no longer has a chance.  The system is rigged in the favor of those with money.  Things like banks get loans at 0%.  Something the average guy has NO chance of.  I'm not sure why people would have the same faith they had 20 years ago.  
Maybe this is not all 'currency' but it does fall under the monetary system in my eyes.

I like the simplicity of the site.  You do need some info on the about page that is not just from external press.  Why isn't there info on you on the site, why just a link to twitter, etc.?  The support page seems like a good start and I expect it to grow over time.

Having faith in it because you actually believe it is fair/just versus having faith in it because you hope/need it to be fair and just are two totally different things.  I think if too many people blindly have faith in anything dirty shit natually increases but who knows.  Not saying I am running away from CC's and paper money but I certain think there is manipulation there.
As a funny aside, today I was talking to a fellow geek/friend of mine about the NYT articleon [More Demands on Cell Carriers in Surveillance](  He's like "you need a vpn for your phone calls and text messages."  I was like, "makes we want to move to an island and just use bitcoins."

How about linking directly to the post here too?

Your family's ideas were crazy.  Not yours.  No downboat for you.

That's what I meant, I just didn't get specific about affording to pay for the house because you have to pay another loan to someone else.
@_date: 2015-09-29 09:50:47
I think they also have a fear you got the [large amount of] money as a gift but are trying to play it off as your and can't really afford to pay for the house.

Step 1, move to Ecuador.

@_date: 2013-04-09 01:04:03
Are you going to give her a weekly allowance in btc :)

As someone from NYC who thinks of something totally different when they see 'subway,' this is great.
@_date: 2013-07-10 04:04:14
Oh, did not realize.  That sucks.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:53:31
And stick it in a safe in a wall???
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:52:43
What about 5, $100 cards though???
