do you see any links w/ a BTC address?

I've selfishly thought this many times.  It hasn't happened and I don't expect it to.  But it's a nice thought :)  Thanks for that.

Well, buying back in at a minimal amount would be equivalent to a rent payment.  I don't exactly prosper at this point in my life.  Hopefully one day.  Thanks for responding.

Thanks for saying something.  I didn't post this looking for a handout.  I just needed to verbalize it.  This has been my own private hell.

Actually, yes.  You're holding a BTC.  The $2k loss is a drop in my bucket.  Be thankful you're still in the game, you'll do ok down the road.  Enjoy the ride!

Thanks for this, and I wholeheartedly agree.  BTC has brought me much closer to the most important people in my life, and that is invaluable.  That was the whole point of my generosity.  My sadness is that I excluded myself from the circle I created.

BTC will hit more gains and take more loses.  It's part of the roller coaster ride everyone's on.  
I do intend on buying back in at 0.1 when I can gather the funds.  I'm just not in that position at this time in my life.  One day I hope.  Thanks for the reply.

I think you're right.. the bubble will burst, but the bubble has been half the fun :)

Thanks for that thoughtful response.  I had no idea there was follow up on the pizza guy, that made me smile.  
I appreciate your confirmations, and I know I did the right thing.  BTC will never really have a dollar value for me, because it's something I'd hopefully pass down to someone after I'm gone.  I just wish I could be more than a fake smile every day I'm thanked.
