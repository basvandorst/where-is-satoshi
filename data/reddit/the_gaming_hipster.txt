I completely agree with you however, I was coming at this mainly from an investment point of view. Hence the analysis at the bottom comparing it to gold and silver traditional currency investments. Sorry, I guess I should have made this more clear.

But when Bitcoin was priced at $1 that was its fair market value and now its grown from there, prices are set by supply and demand and thus change over time to reflect the changes. I don't think the price of a house has ever had a fair market value of $1 USD by actual supply and demand. Thus it is fair to look at bitcoin's price growth as each increase has the price has been a genuine change in the supply and demand for the currency.

Silver went up 68% during the period from 2009 to 2016 however, since you couldn't invest in bitcoin properly in 2009 I decided to take the investment calculations from 2010 as this was when Mt Gox opened hence the smaller gain for silver as the increase was from 2010 to 2016.

I was only looking at how it performed against the major currencies in this infographic. However, I think I would enjoy creating another infographic comparing the performance of all of the altcoins if you are interested?
@_date: 2016-01-10 11:42:19
I created this infographic myself after hearing that bitcoin was the best performing currency in 2015 as I wanted to see just how well bitcoin stacked up in the previous years and the results surprised me! Please leave feedback about the infographic and if you would like to see more like it!

Well actually their money rather than currency but I couldn't be bothered adding that in anywhere. Gold and silver have been around for thousands of years, much more established forms of money than the new fiat currencies.
@_date: 2016-01-10 23:34:16
So gold and silver have been the favoured choice of money for thousands of years and then government comes along and says now everyone MUST use fiat and that suddenly makes gold and silver no longer moneys? A money is something by definition that is portable, durable, divisible, fungible and a store of value. Which gold and silver tend to fit those criteria more than fiat currencies.

Yep works like any other wallet just with the added feature of being able to buy with PayPal. Although you should beware that atombit charges a premium on their price so I wouldn't suggest buying from them for day trading but you'll have no issues if your in it for the long run.

Sanders would destroy bitcoin don't be fooled! He's a socialist he wants to the government to control everything because he thinks government can handle things better than the markets can. The whole point of bitcoin is to avoid government control, I can assure once Bernie worked out he couldn't control it and that it was being used for things like the silk road he would be strictly against it.

Atombit is an IOS app that you buy btc with PayPal without ID. I'm in the same position as you I'm 17 and thus far it's my only option I've found.

By Jan 1st of 2014 it had already begun falling I believe the price was somewhere in the $700 rang thus from Jan 1st of 2013 until Jan 1st of 2014 the rise was less than from the start of the year until the peak.

To suggest that you would have to move the physical gold around the world is as ridiculous as suggesting that you have to move physical cash around the world. In today's society gold would act like cash just with a more stable price. It would sit in banks and banks would transfer numbers on screens just like they do now when you transfer fiat around the world the cash sits in the bank (well gets loaned out) and the bank transfers numbers on screens to another account around the world. And sure gold and silver haven't always been the currency of choice but generally they have been chosen as mediums of exchange more than other goods and have remained stable for longer periods of time than other mediums of exchange.

At the bottom the sources are there from xe.com and bitcoinhelp.net your welcome to fact check the numbers if you can be bothered redoing the calculations. I do have a spreadsheet but its messy so I'd prefer not to share it. But if you do check numbers do add up.

For all the gold bugs out there as well Gold is just about to pass its all time high in Australian Dollars. It's a great time to be holding hard assets.

what is the ticker for total market cap on tradingview?
@_date: 2015-09-10 05:43:43
The price has dropped $10 USD in just 2 days. I know this is nothing to be worried about at all but I'm used to prices reflecting fundamentals. Is this $10 swing due to something specific or do swings like this occur simply depending on the mood of the traders on any given day?

I completely agree with this statement which is why I'm a huge fan of gold because it has actual value which is set in the market place. However, those investing in gold right now are doing so because of issues in the currency markets. In the worst case scenario if some of the major global currencies were to seriously devalue due to a currency crisis I see a transition back to a gold based system as a long and complicated process (albeit the right process). In the mean time though Bitcoin could substitute for failing currencies in an instance and it is this convenience that I'm interested in should a currency crisis develop. Obviously this is an absolute worst case scenario and is not something that I see likely to happen however, the possibility of this situation makes me think about how this scenario would actually pan out.
@_date: 2015-09-10 05:14:35
I guess stating "all currencies" is a major generalization. I just didn't want people to use the excuse of the recent strengthening USD. But YTD most major currencies Bitcoin has fallen against although I can't see this trend continuing.

Download Atombit on IOS you can buy Bitcoin using PayPal from any country in the world, whereas some credit card buying sites only allow from certain countries. You can then send the Bitcoins from your phone to a private wallet if you wish with Atombit.

For those of you who find it hard to see, the sections of the pie chart follow the legend in a clockwise manner. The sections also go from greatest to smallest in a clockwise manner. Thus Mycelium had the greatest single percentage therefore it at 12 o'clock and is first on the legend. Electrum came second so it follows Mycelium both on the legend and in the pie chart. I hope this helps!

Have you used it before? Can I send money to my own Bitcoin Wallet?
I just checked it out it doesn't have the best of reviews.

These are the top 13 choices (as well as other) from the r/bitcoin's favorite wallet survey. I tried removing any answers that appeared to be submitted several times in succession to eliminate cheating and make the results more realistic. I hope everyone finds this interesting!

Yeah I do live in Australia, I just tried using circle then and when I try to add a debit card is says that my card number is incorrect :(

I have added all "other" responses to official options for the question now. The summary page of results has also been changed to suit these results. If you have any more popular wallet options that you feel are not listed as official options please let me know so I can update the survey. I don't know every single Bitcoin wallet in existence. 
@_date: 2015-09-07 23:37:01
Do you have a personal favourite or know which one charges the smallest transaction fee?
@_date: 2015-09-10 00:14:02
changetip or if you have PayPal you can use the atomBit app on IOS
@_date: 2015-09-20 04:08:31
It was an option in the initial survey however, it did not make the top 13 thus all of it's votes are included in "other."

I own a small amount of bitcoin and my interest comes not from the technology but rather my understanding of financial markets. As many people are aware the fiat system is quickly vanishing with countries slowly turning away from the US Dollar as the FED has it on life support with 0% interest rates and QE. Traditionally I have favored gold much more than bitcoin because unlike fiat and also bitcoin gold has value in the market other than because of its value as money. However, I am a realist and I realize that when the fiat system goes under as every single fiat system in history has, bitcoin is a much more likely currency alternative than gold in the short term as people can quickly buy and spend it. It would be much easier for shops to turn to bitcoin in the event of currency crisis than gold in the short term as we have seen in places like Greece. I still remain very bullish on gold in the long term however, but I still recognize that it is wise to own bitcoin as well, as I don't believe that people will adopt bitcoin by their own choice but they will be forced to adopt it when the inevitable currency crisis hits and demand will go through the roof and take the price of bitcoin with it.

Unfortunately convincing my parents to sign up and buy digital currency on my behalf won't be an option

I have exactly the same issues. You can try circle and buy with credit card but they tend not to work with cards from outside of the US you can give it try though. If you really don't want to provide ID you can try buying bitcoin through Atombit or Changtip but they're expensive and a hassle.
