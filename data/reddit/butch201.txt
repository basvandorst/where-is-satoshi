I asked a similar question (leaving coins on Coinbase) with similar replies. I was convinced to get my coins off of Coinbase, until I started looking into Trezor, Ledger or another hard wallet. The problem is that they’re not reliable either! I’ve seen product failures on both systems! So, now what? Ledger seems the worst because the person owning one has been frozen out of his coins for weeks,  now, with no customer support from the company.
All in all, alt-coins are risky enough without all this bullspit &amp; I’m seriously reconsidering the whole idea of investing in them!
Stocks, gold, etc aren’t perfect, but they certainly have better means of storage than alt-coins, which seem like a real crap-shoot!
I wonder if any insurance company would be willing to insure our alt-coins like they will gold, silver, artworks, or SIPC protecting our stocks &amp; FDIC protecting our bank assets. I kind of doubt it.
Just my rant, sorry to step on your question.

No, he really can't. Ah, can we  skip the 12 hours of arguing about it.
All official material says he had nothing to do with STARTING the fire,

You’re discounting greed! Personally, if it really shot to $25k, I would become VERY reluctant to sell (admittedly, I’m reluctant at $10k, 11k etc). And other people’s FOMO could very well kick in! 
Might I sell one or more BTC? Quite possibly  (my goal is affordable business class seats for long trips!). But, total sell out? No way!

Jeez, I just breezed through a link in a matter of minutes &amp; learned quite a bit - &amp; ain’t nobody giving me squat! You’re a college boy, right?
For $4 million plus, do a little more study than I did, contact a qualified tax attorney who has experience with alt-coins (they’re out there). and go from there to make decisions even more valuable than available on a sub Reddit (believe it or not!)
Good luck &amp; don’t even hesitate to throw me one of those Bitcoins in gratitude for the great advice!

Good idea! Kind of hope we won;t see a down day for Bitcoin (at least for months), but of course, ain’t gonna happen!
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:15:16
Thanks! I was so happy to by at $133/coin so my DCA is shot, but at least I didn’t lose too much fiat!
@_date: 2019-06-16 17:08:05
Very astute! I did opt for the additional security (didn’t even remember, but...).
And, yes, they are more in control of my coins than I am! Worse case, I’ll convert to cash, but I don’t want to.

I’m now positive that version 4 is totally fake. Fortunately, my computer knew it &amp; quarantined it. Only thing now is it’s also quarantining the proper new software (&amp; I’m hoping the version 4 won’t pop up with a new, correct software!)
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:33:21
Well, you change my mind &amp; I’ll change yours! Otherwise, we’ll both be loaded with Bitcoin - which would be horrible ��

I’ll do that. Thanks!
So, after I get the computer, will Bitcoin CORE be ok to use?
Can I then dl the newest version of Electrum just to retrieve my Bitcoin?

My Jazz app can’t find node.dll &amp; something else &amp; asked me to re-install. I can’t find the original .exe so I dl’ed a different version &amp; it’s acting like I have no coins at all. I wrote down my ETH address, thinking that’s all I needed, but that’s apparently useless. Oh well, 2 ETH gone &amp; (hopefully) a lesson learned!

Not so sure that the Internet is so different, but I must say, I saw a bio of John D. Rockefeller and the oil discovery in Pennsylvania reminded me immediately of Bitcoin. The beginning of a massive disruption in all of lives (especially hodlers, but not just us either).
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:53:49
Well, I don’t have money to burn,  but I do have ~$5,000 invested in the Electrum! 
But, I’m confused, does Mac use Linux?
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:03:29
I’d love to save them just because I originally bought 2 ETH at $600 ea, then bought these 2 at $133 ea as I still had faith! I’m thinking my DCA is good &amp; not too far from b/e currently! Then, I find  I can’t access them!
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:35:49
It’s frustrating! Because we have faith that it’s better to profit-take at $12k than at $11k and so forth. Plus. I gotta wonder how many small fry are selling out versus whales selling a bit.

I asked Redditors a similar question: can Coinbase protect my assets better than I. The resounding answer was “NO” &amp; I should remove my “stuff” ASAP. sooo, I tried to do so &amp; they’re saying my address isn’t “white listed”, but won’t let me add it, either! 
I imagine I could convert to cash, but I really didn’t want to. Maybe I should &amp; give up on alt-coinage, I dunno.
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:47:54
Thanks for the reply! 
Now, though, my computer keeps blocking the real program without giving me a chance to override it. Any idea how to get past that?
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:31:54
How the hell does that ALWAYS happen? My stocks, too! It’s gotten that I just shrug &amp; hope the decline isn’t too severe! Maybe it just seems like it, but it sure isn’t 50/50 like you might expect.
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:39:11
Thanks for the reply. 
I think you’re right! I don’t intend to do much other than hodl- probably give to my grandson, down the road, so I think you’re right.
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:42:04
Thanks! Will do more research. I do store the little I currently have of lite coins &amp; bitcoins in a separate disk, so I guess that’s safe from thieves &amp; me screwing up! Hope so, anyway.
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:37:09
Thanks for your reply. 
I’m going to take your suggestion! I do store my little bits of coins off-line  and that seems to be working. And, I never plan on being an active trader (Hodler instead)
