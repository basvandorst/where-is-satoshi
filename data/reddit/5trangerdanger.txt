MSB and MT regulations are different. I know for a fact that they are not registers as an MT in any state.
All the first link you provided shows is that they have registered with FinCen as an MSB and indicated that they are active in all 50 states. MSB registration is done on the federal level no state input or approval is required.
The second article is almost a year old (forever in bitcoin) and says absolutely nothing about MT registration.
MT regulations are done on a state by state basis for 47 states. Coinbase has done 0 of these. Stop spreading lies when you clearly don't have a basic idea of how money transmission laws work. 
Getting an MSB registration is easy compared to MT licenses, and according to guidance released by FinCen Coinbase is clearly an MT business. They are not in compliance with MT regulations right now, not a single bitcoin exchange is. If one of the states wanted to sue to shut them down, they could quite easily.
Edit: just read their MSB filing, they even call themselves a Money Transmitter, even though on their website they claim not to be one. Again the key point is that they are not registered as a MT in any state in the US.

My first argument was that Google is better than apple when it comes to fucking over customers. Are their any companies that announced NSA spying right off, or outright told them to fuck off? If not how can you use it as a metric of any kind. Everyone pays taxes, does that mean that all companies are for the military industrial complex and the US foreign policy that is based around fucking up innocent people halfway across the globe?
The most major difference I can think of is voting rights, The founders at Google still own ~50% of the voting rights meaning they can still make the big decisions without having to worry about shareholders to the same extent that other large companies have to.

I already found a flaw in this second article you linked with a 30 second skim.


mt gox was a fractional reserve....


Author does not understand the definition of order of magnitude, or has 0 understanding of the current cost structure of existing transaction systems


completely ignoring the pluthera of other outcomes possible for bitcoin future ie using itself as a source with no external citations other than its other, prior deranged ramblings


False, see mt gox (definitely fractional reserve) or  even coinbase (could be a fractional reserve, you have no way of knowing)


True, but only once deflation kicks in, not before.
Tell me more about how reliable this site is...It's based almost entirly about assumptions of what the market will look like once bitcoin is already the currency de rigueur, ignoring the long process to get there. Color me unimpressed.

While I can understnad this point of view, I try to look at it from a larger perspective. Ehrsam is a former banker, who knows just what he needs to say to get bankers and the current system to buy into bitcoin. While I don't agree with his ideology, I acknowledge that the buy in of existing systems is important if we want bitcoin to thrive. I'm not saying we need JPM or GS on board, but if banks and regulators work proactively to strictly limit bitcoins availability and usability, its going to be very hard to realize any type of bitcoin based society or belief system.

Can you show me where on any FDIC material it says they cover losses due to anything other than bankruptcy or insolvency?
From glossing over this page:
It seems like their are a lot of variables at play when it comes to banker's blanket bond and that determining appropriate levels of liability which needed to be covered under this insurance product. It's easy for a bank to estimate how much currency can be stolen in physical bank robberies, but almost impossible to determine an estimate for loss due to employee dishonesty, or online theft. The banks may have coverage, but there is no guarantee that they have enough coverage.
Again your shifting the argument from all deposits are guaranteed no matter what, to a very specific case which makes a number of assumptions. My original argument that the FDIC doesn't covered losses due to fraud still stands. Trying to equate theses additional insurance policies which could be inadequate for a number or reasons (counter party risk, inadequate coverage, some failing on the banks part which invalidates the coverage, etc) to FDIC coverage which is backed by the full faith of the federal government is ludicrous and disingenuous. 
I prefer to use facts for my arguments rather than, "conventional wisdom", or relying on something "everyone knows". If that makes me a tinfoil hat guy, I guess I need some more aluminum foil.
edit: it seems that banker's blanket bond are required by some, but not all states. As such you might be right to assert that in some cases, "savings are insured no matter what", but as a general statement, its still false.

The biggest problem with that article is that it relies on both of these statements being simultaniously true:




if the first takes place then the second is no longer valid. Meaning a successful legal attack on bitcoin invalidates the entirety of the article. Since his only argument against the feasibility of such an attack is that such an attack wont succeed, I take issue with his credibility.
If, today, the US government said all bitcoins would be taxed at 35% and any bank that does business with a bitcoin company must enforce this taxation bitcoin would be forced into the black market. At which point it is no longer an assured vessel for wealth accumulation ,meaning its infinity more plausible for government bureaucrats to attack it...
The entire article is one giant self referencing fallacy.

That is a great question, which I have no authority or knowledge to answer. If I had to guess I would think you would technically be responsible for reporting BTC dividends, but like I said I'm not sure.
The best way to check would be to look at how the IRS handles dividends on stocks held in foreign accounts. If that is the correct comparision I would think that you would be liable for BTC based income, taxed at the exchange rate from the day the dividend was distributed. But im not an account or a tax lawyer, and Im not sure guidance has even been issued on this case, given that BTC based exchanges are illegal ipso facto.

comparing the government of Cyprus to the Federal Reserve is extremely erroneous. The Fed has the ability to set the interest rate within the US (and to a largest extent much of the world).

Because that currency doesn't have to be bitcoin. The criticism you lambast is most often levied by people who have a fundamental distrust for deflationary currencies. You can set up the blockchain with an inflationary currency or a currency controlled by a central bank and just use the blockchain as a public ledger. Worried about miner incentives? legislate it. 
It is 100% possible for the technology to succeed without bitcoin, just not in its current iteration. But given enough incentive and time i guarantee you the financial industry and the regulators they own could find a way.

He also failed to predict the financial; crisis (in fact he thought housing was doing great all the way up until 08) and after reversing his position that Europe wouldn't experience a crisis like the US had, he predicted on 10+ separate occasions that the Eruo was ready for immediate collapse...3 years later and we are no closer to a Euro collapse then we were when he made the prediction.
All you need to do is listen to what his actual predictions are, rather than what he says they were, and its blatantly obvious that he doesn't know what the fuck he is talking about.

You're assuming that their is a price at which no one will sell, and ignoring the fact that new bitcoins are created every 10 minutes.
If I had bought $500 billion worth bitcoins and no one wanted to sell me anymore, 10 minutes later when those fresh 25 coins hit the market I would buy each one for $20 million bringing me to a trillion and the market price to $20 million / btc. Could I turn around and sell a bitcoin for $20 million? probably not, but thats not the question were debating here.
Edit: for another thing your second situation will never happen and heres how I can prove it. I have several bitcoins, there are a few that I dont ever intend to sell. If your second scenario played out, I would certianly be willing to sell my single bitcoin for half a trillion dollars. I personally vow to take up that role.

Theft isn't covered by the FDIC, its covered by additional (voluntary) insurance products purchased by banks. That means that if a bank thinks you are guilty of this type of fraud, they can refuse to reimburse you for your "losses." Their is no guarantee that you will get your money (outside of contractual agreements you and the bank agreed to when you open your account, but I definitely didn't read those line by line, as I think most people don't.)

bitcoins rate of deflation will equal the growth of the bitcoin economy. 
deflationary currencies promote slow and steady growth, rather than the insane periods of growth followed by intense prolonged recessions we see now.
Given that all resources are finite, why wouldn't we promote stable growth, reasonable consumption, and rational investing. Inflationary currencies fly in the face of all those things. They support debt, rampant consumerism, and malinvestment. 
edit: people have different risk-reward spectrums, some people will be content with 2%, most wont. The people who invest most of the money in stocks and bonds right now are the wealthiest 10%. They wont be content with 2% returns in any market, otherwise they would buy nothing but treasuries and TIPS.

Citing a blog from the echo chamber to tell me about how everything speculated about in the echo chamber must come to pass is hardly going to convince me of anything...
Just look at the article, its talkign about the success of bitcoin as a method of value transfer, it doesnt even talk about upending fiat or ending government currency. It argues that the only way to attack bitcoin is to make it worhtless. Not only is that untrue, its flat out misleading. The govenrment will be perfectly happy to let bitcoin exist as a method of instutitonal value transfer, but if you think they are going to let it become the dominant currency, you need to read about the military industrial complex, or the federal reserve, you're speculating about industry and organizations you clearly know little about.
Shit the article assumes that people will stop attacking bitcoin because it's more profitable to just buy it...The number of assumptions and incorrect aspirations of motives in that sentence alone is enough to make me reject the entire rest of the article...Even if bitcoin takes off it will never be more profitable than printing money at will...which is literally what central banks have the ability to do today.

That was her responsibility IMO.
Judging from her reaction after the fact, that possibility never crossed her mind. her reaction is not even "my bad"

The problem is that with your CC and simple social engineering it's relatively easy to apply for a new CC in your name. Now the identity thief is running around, charging shit online in your name. While you probably wont have to pay these charges, it will show up on your credit report when they don't pay. Yes it is possible to get these removed, but its not 100% success rate, add in the time that it takes to fight with the credit card companies, reporting agencies, and companies who said identity theft might have defrauded.
Identity theft is serious, just google repercussions and in 2 minutes you can see very real people are suffering as a result. Maybe not as a direct financial result, but in time lost, energy wasted, and possible black marks on a credit history.
You can downplay the risks of identity theft all you want, and just say the CC companies will take care of it, but you've obviously never had to deal with the situation or any kind of serious charge back, because it is not as easy or painless as you seem to think it is.

The long troll!! Well played.
But seriously, you're going to have a hard time convincing Keynesian economists (who control most of the central banks) that a deflationary currency is anything but evil. They might take profits in it personally, but their belif is that widespread deflationary currency use will have horrific economic ramifications. 
You can bet your ass that they will be hypocritical and take profits while outlawing its use or taxing it into obscurity for the masses. Just look at any government organization today and you will see this type of behavior.
Your article also blatently states that a successful attack by the state is possible but that bitcoin will simply move deeper into the black market...hardly a future that causes "the collapse of all fiat everywhere..." More likely than not we will have a dualistic system where deflationary currencies exist along side inflationary ones, but if the deflationary currencies ever truly take hold, expect the statists to intervene with force if necessary. If you dont believe me just look up gold confiscation in the US or read up on the foundings of the existing federal reserve system in the early 20th century.

Where did I ever say that the FDIC is in charge of bailouts? All i'm saying is that if Bank of America had been allowed to go bankrupt the FDIC does not have enough funds to cover all the depositors. Pick any other TBTF bank, if they actually failed the FDIC would in no way shape or form be able to make all depositors under ~100k whole. 
I only involved TARP and the Fed because the allowed the banks to stay alive, thus avoiding the painful reality that the FDIC is not designed to handle massive capital market failures, only small localized ones. A great depression style collapse would wipe out the FDIC's reserves in a matter of weeks.

It's not horrible, their are quite a few reasons it is so low, mostly reinvestment. Also just looking at margin is irrelevant without looking at what the norm in the industry is. Most retail businesses have net profit margins between [2-5%] ( making Amazons not look so bad by comparison.

I guess I sort of assumed that OP was a business owner, no one lies on the internet right? I could see a lot of demand for small service companies who's developers want to be paid in bitcoin (there are literally dozens of us!). But since most of those developers are paid in the fiat equivalent this wouldn't be super relevant at the moment. 
A lot of time new services create the demand which later propels them to success. I'm'sure you cant think of a lot of products/services which there wasn't a market for before the first entrant showed up.
The more I think about it the more I think you're right, its too early for a service like this to really take off (bitpagos excluded, its amazing the demand for bitcoin in countries where the national currency is at best, unstable) . But that doesn't mean that someone cant start working on it. All you really need is a square account, some actuarial knowledge (even that is probably optional if you do rolling reserves), a bit of financial acumen, and that entrepreneurial spirit. After initial coding I imagine fixed costs would be low, meaning you could run it at a loss for a substantial amount of time. This feels like a space where being first to market would be a big advantage. Though if the service starts taking off I'm sure coinbase bitpay and the like would jump all over it, great hedge for their existing activities. 
Sooo yes and no?

Again, payment processor companies will be the most likely ones to bear this risk.
In any case I would say 1 confirmation is enough for the vast majority of transactions (personally I think 0 is fine with a high enough propagation % even given the double-spend outlined in this post. Just like most people don't commit CC fraud or use fake money, most people wont attempt double-spends). As I said somewhere else ITT I don't think this type of double-spend works after even 1 confirmation and those that do require a prohibitive % of hash power. 
I personally don't have a problem waiting 8-15 minutes (30 is a little bit of an exaggeration) during this early adoption phase. I'm confident that when/if bitcoin becomes significantly widespread systems will be set up to deal with this issue, they are already being discussed.
In his example the wait time between the first and second tx was around a minute, how long can that be extended? If its less then the amount of time it takes for a block to be found than that amount of time could be used, rather than waiting for a full block. 
edit: just realized his second double spend had a delay of 3 min, so that last paragraph might not be as meaningful.

Like I said in my original post, no major company discusses potential legal action with the other party over the phone. She wouldn't even have made that request to a US company, she would have sent certified mail which would have been forwarded to the companies lawyer. In some ways her asking to speak over the phone was an insult, as much as his request to talk of IRC IMO.
As far as the PGP issue goes, he goes on to address that in a later email and their are several public central authorities that the SEC could use to authenticate their key. I got the feeling he didnt want to discuss with her over IRC anymore than he did over the phone, so in that sense it's a moot point.
He's treating the SEC the same way they treat the people they investigate, guilty until proven innocent. He just has very little incentive to put up with her bullshit as he's pretty much decided that they have no authority to regulate his enterprise.

That's brutal, has he considered only taking cash? If not then I think the situation is analogous to worrying about double-spends with bitcoins.

I live in the real world, and for the time being the only way banking will get better or worse is via government actions. Of course we all want bitcoin to take of and revolutionize finance, but sadly, that's probably not going to happen. You know as well as I do that the vested interests (Private banks, central banks, governments) parent going to let bitcoin take their power without a fight, and at the end of the day military force&gt;bitcoins increased efficiencies for most people.
Bitcoin has the potential to change some aspects of banking and finance, but not all. For those elements that bitcoin is not going to affect, having good people in the regulatory arm of the government is the only way change will occur.  I have yet to see a realistic proposal for how things will change without good regulators other than "bitcoin hur dur"

IIRC the worst thing that happened was that some of the exchanges shut down for &lt;24 hours...In the world of bitcoins, thats a tiny problem.
In any case, as Andreas pointed out, it was a flaw that was first noted in 2011...exchanges that did their due diligence never had a problem with it.

Microsoft had what amounted to a monopoly, even today they have what amounts to 90% of the OS market. When the monopoly case was filed it was even higher IIRC. In addition all Intel chips had Microsoft, so ya, they had a monopoly. From the wikipedia article:


As you can see the situation was very different from the one currently facing Apple. Not defending apple's actions, just saying that the comparison is not accurate.
edit: also if you were a business in the late 90's when the case was going on, you were forced to buy a microsoft PC. That's the crux of their monopoly ruling, there wasn't a commercially viable alternative to the microsoft OS. Apple was garbage for corporate users (still is for most non-tech companies)

Except that to people who would like to do as much of their business in bitcoin as possible, it is useful. If a company is paying their suppliers in bitcoin its most definitely useful.
While the use case might be limited, there is clearly a demand, and its a service that will only become more in demand as bitcoin becomes more popular. Search engines weren't very useful when they only indexed a handful of pages and most people didn't know how to use them. Does that mean that Google should never have been started?

You forgot the US, were pretty well known for that too, tho morose for our brutal human rights violations against other countries citizens.
In any case none of it supports the idea that Cuba is some dictatorial hell whole ala North Korea and that the US is just blissfully trying to help these poor Cubans.

Ripple and Assembly both use the blockchain tech without bitcoin. And I can think of cases where true decentralization isn't necessary, where a loosely organized federated system works just as well (no single person controls the blockchain, but its not public either a sort of hybrid  system). All of these are examples where bitcoin **might** not be necessary. 
The tweeters point really is that the blockchain tech, in its current form, requires an economic and publicly available incentive and the only one we can think of that makes sense is bitcoin.

You make some good points but I'm going to clarify a few things. I worked for a company that manages retirement and pension plans exclusively so this was kind of my area of expertise. Please excuse the geek-out wall of text that follows. 
You definitely have a choice when it comes to the 401k, you are given a list of funds and get to choose between them. The options might be great but you do have some choice.
With a pension plan you are correct, the investment committee (separate from the board of directors, usually made up of some fiance people, some HR people, and a C level exec or two) gets to decide how to invest that. In reality the consultant is making those decisions and they do so not to maximize profit, but to match potential liabilities and ensure a rate of return that will reach plan goals. They take into consideration a ton of factors (I can go into detail but I'm pretty sure no one outside the industry would really care) and will have multiple actuaries assigned to the plan
People don't realize that they can have a much bigger impact on these investments than people think. If enough employees tell the committee members that they want a socially responsible option, you can bet that they will add one.
Also participants have the option to sue if the plan doesn't garner enough returns, putting the investment committee between a rock and a hard place. They are legally mandated to put the interests of participants first, the real culpable agent are the regulatory agencies who, in a lot of ways, have tied the hands of investment committees. 
I wasn't trying to say that individuals are personally responsible, just that anyone with a retirement account is benefiting from these profit maximizing decisions, not just banksters and hedge fund managers.

I wont even address the video, because, honestly, its laughable. If MC and Visa were worried, you would see super bowl adds, not youtube videos made by someones daughter as a project for her cinematography 201 class. Also SE Asia represents like 12% of MC revenue, not exactly the same as the US organization (52%) coming out and denouncing bitcoin. 
The article you link re lobbying even indicates that their are 5 lobbyists...total..lobbying on bitcoin and mobile payments. Given that Apple just launched a huge mobile payments platform, I think it's a bit arrogant to suggest that 5 people are dedicated solely to lobbying against bitcoin. In any case, these lobbyist were working on digital payments *in addition to* dozens of other issues, according to the article.
As far as governments are concerned I think the map supports the opposite side of your argument. The majority of developed countries have made it legal, the places that are making it illegal are, by and large, authoritarian (Bangladesh, Bolivia, Ecuador and Kyrgyzstan are the only countries which have banned bitcoin, unless you count Icceland, which has essentially banned all forex). They make everything illegal, bitcoin isn't getting any special attention.
IMO the Visa's and MC's of the world, as well as the majority of governments, are looking at bitcoin the way the horse and buggy industry looked at cars in 1902. They were viewed as an eccentric curiosity that wouldn't stand the time. Something only for the rich that would never take off because horses were just so much better (and they were). If anything they lobbied to keep them off the roads, not because they were afraid of being displaced, but out of sheer inconvenience and a dislike for these loud, polluting machines. That's how your average CC company exec views bitcoin, if they have given it any thought at all.

Just woke up so I only read the abstract and conclusion of the paper but I'm having difficulty understanding the relevance. Ill come back to it in a few hours and read the whole thing but for now consider the following:
If their are 100 btc left 100 years from now and I own 1 I own 1% of the market, or 100 million satoshis. Lets say that at that time 1 btc =  10 billion USD giving us a total btc market of value of 1 trillion. (granted it would be much higher since the USD will have inflated away another 95% of its value, but that's irrelevant for our thought experiment.)
What this means is that 1 satoshi = 100 dollars. In order to facilitate smaller transactions a fork is created that allows bitcoins to be divided by another 4 decimal places. Lets call the smallest unit fuckjeahs. each fuckjeah is now worth .01 USD.
Its important to note that no ones wallet balance has changed. I still hold 1 btc, but in addition to dividing it into 100 million satoshis I can divide it into 1 trillion fuckjeahs. Prices remain the same, what used to cost me 1 satoshi now costs me 10,000 fuckjeahs.
I'm having trouble seeing where value is destroyed in this scenario.

I think most people break the law when it comes to taxation, unintentionally or otherwise. Especially people who earn income outside their primary line of work. Does that make it ok? No, but it definitely doesn't vilify bitcoin either. If it did you would have to be just as pissed about people who tutor, or do yard work, or any other part time cash based job to earn extra money on the side. 
I haven't paid taxes on mine, but I haven't sold any either. Technically I should pay taxes every time I buy something with BTC. I find that to be burdensome and a ridiculous requirement. It should be treated like any other currency and I think eventually it will. Given the uncertainty around bitcoin taxation laws, and even legality to a certain extent for a large portion of 2013, it's very understandable that people didn't, or haven't, paid taxes.

The recent history of money would suggest otherwise.


Not necessarily, if im using the blockchain to record property, and full nodes are run by notaries across the country, you have a system where the tokens are irrelevant, yet people are still incentived to mine (their business depends on the security of the property registry). You can even  incentivise people to run nodes and mine with fiat if you so choose, nothing says it has to be bitcoin.


Certainly makes it more attractive to the banking industry who controls the legislative and regulatory process...
I'm all about bitcoins success but dont let your fanboyism get in the way of a realistic assessment of the situation. The blockchain is inherently valuable as a decentralized ledger system. Bitcoin needs the ledger, not the other way around.
Shit 6 years ago decentralized currency was "impossible" are you really going to tell me that you think no one will find a way to make the blockchian valuable without bitcoin? pretty naive.

You're shifting the argument from federally protected to insured. I never said that they weren't covered, just that they are federally guaranteed (as are funds lost during a bank closure or bankruptcy).
The first paragraph says funds MAY be covered but only if your bank has purchased the appropriate insurance policy. Also the paragraph says:


emphasis mine.
The second paragraph doesnt address the question at hand. You are correct that the accounts listed are protected by the FDIC, but again the FDIC only pays out if your bank goes bankrupt.
At the end of the day there is no guarantee that funds stolen by a hacker with access to your online banking would be reimbursed. There is a good chance that they would, but there is no federal guarantee of reimbursement.

Really? The banks that held onto all the toxic mortgage securities weren't deposit taking? Obviously Lehman and Bear sterns weren't. How about BofA? Do they take deposits? I cant recall.Or citigroup, or JPMorgan, or PNC? Do they take deposits?
The cause of the crash (which you believe to be deregulation and I believe to be reckless policies of the Federal Reserve after the dot com bust) is irrelevent to thsi discussion. The fact of the matter is that without TARP funds there would have been quite a few deposit taking banks that went bankrupt. The FDIC would have in no way shape or form been able to make all of the depositors whole given the level of funding they have, and continue to believe is adequate. That's all I'm trying to say.
We can argue about deregulation until the cows come home but it doesn't change the fact that in a serious financial crisis ala the great depression the FDIC would fail in a heartbeat without serious government intervention.

Why? bitcoin companies are already legal as long as they comply with MT and MSB laws. Look at Coinbase, they have $30 million in venture financing and I'm pretty sure they are not compliant with any MT laws at this time, just working on it.
NY offering bitlicenses doesn't change the fact that any exchange will still have to complete 48 different registrations to be able to work with people from anywhere in the US.
Unless a bitlicense includes a MT license by default I dont see how this does anything good for bitcoin. It's just adding more regulation to a regulatory framework that is already super burdensome. 
The only advantage I can think of is clarity on what regulations might come in the future. Other than that, its just another requirement in a long list of requirements to become compliant.

I quote the parts that are relevent to our discussion, you seem to enjoy quoting the rest as some sort of vindication when they are talking about something completely different. They are looking at systemic risks, not micro ones (like fraud and theft), before you get up in arms asking me how I know this, my sister works in the division of the FDIC responsible for monitoring these risks (which has almost nothing to do with consumer protection which is why I didn't bring it up earlier)
You made the blanket assertion that all funds are federally insured no matter what in your first post. I'm just trying to show you that's not true. In states where bankers blanket bonds aren't required are those depositors insured against fraud and theft no matter what? I don't think so. Their is a HUGE difference between the FDIC insuring you against insolvency, and AIG insuring you against theft and fraud. AIG can go out of business, the FDIC can't. Also its important to understand the risks in the financial system, just because most people DGAF doesn't mean I shouldn't either. People assume the government will always take care of them, right up until the point that it doesn't/cant.

Bitcoin is faster in the sense that the merchent will actually have the money faster. When you swipe your debit or CC card and walk out, the merchent doesnt have that money until the CC company completes the transaction. Depending on the situation that can be several hours or several days. 
Again unless more technically proficient doublespend attacks become common 1 confirmation should be enough for anything other than financial instruments or major purchases like a house or a car. In all three of those situations waiting an hour isnt really an issue. 
In any case if you and the merhcant use a payment processor like coinbase or bitpay there is a good chance the transaction will happen offblockchain and will be instant anyway.

The worker bees enforce/implement policy, they dont set it. In any case good luck convincing these drones to invest in an asset which directly threatens their primary source of income (ie their job).
I'm not saying that they wont buy personally, just that they wont endorse it professionally. This kind of hypocracy is everywhere.
In any case all of this is predicated on bitcoin losing its volatility and entering a truly deflationary period (otherwise these worker bees cannot be 100% sure that it will always go up in value). We both might very well be dead by that time.

Interesting, so it sounds like for PayPall the biggest problem would be converting the bitcoins to cash for customers who don't want to hold BTC balances. They would need to have a trusting relationship with one of the major exchanges before they could even consider this.
This is assuming they don't implement a wallet feature which adds all sorts of security, currency hedging, and storage issues.
Even if .5% of paypall transactions went bitcoin, I would think they would need huge volumes to be able to handle it. I know coinbase runs into volume limits with their exchange during volatile periods so I would imagine that that's a big concern for PayPal.
In the long run PayPall would have to lower fees on BTC payments though, as more coinbise type companies enter the market charging the same % on BTC as other payment methods would not be sustainable. I know coinbase is hoping to get to .5% (down from 1%) eventually. 
We live in exciting times!

Australia is an interesting case, median salaries are highly skewed, giving an almost [bimodal distribution] ( You have a few sectors/areas where people can make a ton of money, and as a result keep up with inflation. While a signifigant chuink of the population are far worse off in terms of wage growth relative to inflation.
In addition wealth inequality is just as bad if not worse in Australia than in the US, check GINI coefficient or google Australian wage distribution.
The fed and central bank may be tools, but by their very nature they favor those with first access to credit over those with later access. What this means is that the 1% (big banks and people with large stakes in these banks) get access to newly printed money via the discount window and can spend/invest it before the increased money supply has time to effect prices. They are a tool that is inherently in favor of those who already have money, and inherently biased against people on fixed income (pensioners and retirees especially). They are also great for politicians who want to spend more without raising taxes.
They might be "just a tool" but they are one that's better relegated to a previous age. Buying growth with debt is unsustainable in the long run, and a targeted inflation level is just that. But screw it right? Our kids (or their kids) are the ones who will have to pay.

I think that the heist has never really gone away, its just shifted focus.

If you are trying to truly set up a p2p system you wouldn't need regulatory capture, Im not saying Coinbase should act against their interest, just that we shouldn't be applauding a system that perpetuates an already fucked up way of doing business.
The issue isn't with people acting in self interest, its with the quid pro quo nature of the system. Regulate us favorably while in office, we will give you a fat bonus and a cushy job when you leave.


Come on now, if you think government involvement with bitcoin is going to be temporary you're more naive than I thought.

and that's totally ok. This whole idea that in deflationary environments everyone just holds on to their money is ludicrous at its core. People still have to buy things, most people don't have huge amounts of discretionary income that they would be willing to forgo. At the end of the day would I rather spend $100 on something I enjoy, or wait 12 months and spend $110 on the same thing? TVM works both ways.
At the end of the day most investment in the sense you are thinking is done by the wealthiest 10%. They own most of the stocks and bonds. Now if Keynesians are right, all they need to do is beat inflation. They can easily do that with TIPS. But they don't, they invest in stocks and bonds because they are willing to take on additional risk for a higher reward. This would be exactly the same in a deflationary environment. Would total investment go down? probably, but is that necessarily a bad thing? it simply gives an option to poor people and pensioners to have a viable way to protect the money they save, instead of just having to spend it.
Economies should encourage responsible savings and investment, not the rampant consumerism and investment that lead to asset bubbles and intense recessions. Not to mention the fact that those with first access to credit (large banks) can spend/invest newly printed money before inflationary effects are felt. Inflation is a hidden tax on the poor and pensioners (who are the least likely to invest anyway)

No in this example I pulled out of my ass the miners aren't rewarded. Everyone who is a licensed real estate agent is required to run a single CPU miner, shit maybe NARA even supplies some super low cost miners.
In order to mine you have to have a miner and be a member of NARA. All this particular blockchain is used to do is record home sales. Miners dont get a reward becuase they are inherently rewarded by the strength of the network. Their reward is that they dont have to pay a notary and whoever else every time they close a transaction.

I would assume it is the regulations on money transmitters. AFAIK Coinbase is technically operating illegally right now.

Every time they deal with a  customer in a state where they are not licensed as a money transmitter they are breaking the law.

Once bitcoin stabilizes a bit merchants are going to quickly realize its advantages and will offer substantial discounts, or additional charges for CC purchases.

Shoe banning is obviously a hyperbolic metaphor. Its not really about the shoe banning.
Please tell me how my vote matters. I live in a democratic state, we elect two democratic senators and vote for the democratic president every time, by HUGE margins. If I vote anything but democratic, my vote is irrelevent.
Also in a non-parliamentary system, minority voices are completely silenced. I literally cannot vote for a candidate who opposed the military industrial complex because both the democrats and republicans are in the back pocket of said complex. There is no true ant-war candidate at any level. How is my, and the large % of americans who think we shouldn't be involved in any wars and that our defense budget is too high by orders of magnitude. How do we get our voices heard?

I don't disagree with anything you said, I just don't view Google's decision not to act as a constitutional lawyer on behalf of the country as an "evil" act. 
Since the patriot act and NDAA 2K12 the 4th amendment has come to mean very little. Is that Google's fault? Are they responsible for taking action when the American people clearly don't care? In any case its a much more grey area than taking minorities to gas chambers. Maybe they should be, and if their moto was "do good" rather than "don't be evil" I'd say 100% that they fucked up.

Its like saying that if you raise taxes people wont invest...that's been proven to be bullshit over and over. Just because people can get 2 or 5 or 10% return by sitting on their money doesn't mean that people with lots of money wont want 15 or 20%.
something like 80% of stocks are owned by the top 10% of people. You're telling me those people will be content to earn the same ROI on bitcoin as the rest of us plebes? Thats BS. they will invest, just like they do now, to earn additional revenue.

Except a bank is a single organization, whereas the NAREA, for example, is a collective of individuals. 
You're using the blockchain to force costs more accurately on those who incur them, rather than having the overarching ORG pay for all of them, and then try and figure it out from there. Even in a bank it could be useful if you have different divisions or working groups who access a shared resource. 
The whole point of my post was not to advance a specific idea, just to suggest that maybe our current view on bitcoin is limited compared to the true potential of the technology. I'm not saying this tweeter is wrong or an idiot per se, just that saying something cant be done with any tech has proven to be very shortsighted.

meh, its a very narrow minded view of the technology. It's entirely possible that applications will be developed which make the actual unit of currency irrelevant. Think about using bitcoin for a voting system or property registration.
The question always circles back to how to incentivice minors but IMO that's easy. It can be done legislatively, or just through prudent self regulation. If the national association of real estate agents decided that all registeed agents needed to run a CPU based mining rig for their alt "currency" which would be used to record home sales, the unit of currency becomes irrelevant. Whats important is a federated, publicly available list of transactions, the currency is only necessary when you cant have other incentives.
edit: just wondering how this guy thinks he can know 100% that blockchain tech will never be useful without bitcoins to incentivice miners. Governments and large corporations are very good at developing incentives, who knows how the future will play out.
edit II: This conversation would be so much less vitrolic if he just said cryptocurrency rather than bitcoin :)

I'm pretty sure that only a few hundred were lost PERIOD. There was a thread on bitcointalk where a guy parsed the blockchain looking for examples and found less than 500, most of which were at gox. They shut down because the hype scared people, not because it was a serious problem. And the reason for that hype? Gox lying and saying they lost 750,000 bitcoins to malleability and blaming the protocol, when in reality, it was his incompetence and poor physical security which resulted in the losses.
If there is a known security vulnerability, which has been documented and is easily fixable, but not everyone fixes it, is that a problem with the technology or the implementation? I have high expectations for bitcoin, but low expectations for people like Mark who half ass things and then try to blame a technology when clearly the fault lies with him.
edit: and I'll be the first to admit I don't understand the technical side of it, but the fact that people knew about it in 2011 and no one cared until Gox claimed they lost 750,000 BTC to it in 2013, suggests to me that it wasnt a serious problem.

uhhh what, I can find 13 month data just as easily as you can find 12 month data, if you have the return stream finding annualized or cumulative returns over any period is trivial.
Please tell me why the 12 month period ending December 31 is any more valid for comparative purposes than the 12 month period ending January 15. Some companies end their FY on September 30, is that not a valid 12 month period since it doesn't end December 31? Saying that the period of January 1 to Dec 31 has any more validity in comparison than the period starting February 1 and ending January 31 is straight up stupid.

That cannot happen unless bitcoin achieves legal tender status, which will never happen because it takes away the most powerful tool from centralized governments, economic manipulation. As long as your interaction with government is legislated to take place in fiat, fiat will never collapse.
It's a great dream, but dont let the echo chamber of a bitcoin community distract you from the realities of this world and government. Betamax lost out to VHS, despite being a better technology, and that was without the government's life literally depending on the outcome. If bitcoin starts to look like it is truly threatening the power of central banks, expect it to be outlawe3d or taxed into obscurity immediately. And the excuse will probably be "for the children's/terrorism/drugs/money laundering.
Just because bitcoin is better does not mean it will succeed in the way you think it should. If bitcoin is going to succeed it will be as an institutional method of  money transfer, governments aren't going to give up the idea that inflationary, manipulable currencies are better (for them) just to save a few bps on transaction fees.

@_date: 2015-01-16 00:31:29
sighhhh you are ignoring the point that I can cherry pick any start and end point I want to prove whatever my point is. The period January 1 - December 31 is not a better comparison than any other 365 day period. There is nothing magical about December 31 that makes it a better end date than any other period. 
this is why no one freaks the fuck out that some companies end their FY on September 30, because it doesn't fucking matter. In any case currencies arent stocks, they dont release annual reports, they dont have filings, picking any time period and using it to claim something about anything other than performance over that period is fucking asinine. There is nothing magical about December 31, especially not for currencies or commodities, they trade 24/7/365. That's why no one in finance looks at CY returns as anything other than a talking/selling point for idiots who get their financial news from wherever the fuck you get your financial news from. Anyone serious uses rolling returns over a long period of time, with multiple time frames....because a given CY is a useless piece of data.
If you have a daily return stream calculating 370 or 350 day returns (cumulative or annualized) is trivial. If a fund manager is at -5% on December 31 but up 5% on January 3 do you drop him since his CY performance was shit? No, its fucking irrelevant. 
in any case its pretty clear your knowledge of finance comes straight from CNBC and Jim Cramer, so I really have no interest in continuing this conversation with you.

You're money is protected by an insurance policy your bank takes out with an insurance company. This company is not protected by the FDIC as it is not a deposit taking company. The FDIC only protects you against losses incurred if your bank fails/ it does nothing to protect the bank beyond setting capital requirements. If your bank wont reimburse you for Fraud, the FDIC does not step in. 
Just because most of the time banks reimburse for fraud, doesn't mean they will do it every time or will continue to do so in the future. I bet you if your account got "hacked" 3 or 4 times in a row they wouldn't be reimbursing you any more. Granted, that's an edge case but when your argument is essentially a maxim (all deposits are federally guaranteed 100% of the time) an edge case is all I need to prove to prove you wrong. Gonna change your argument again?
I may be being pedantic but in the world of finance/law definitions are important. Especially when those words or phrases (like federally insured) have very strict definitions.

My guess would be that arbitrage is not feasible for a couple of reasons. Capital controls in China combined with the inability for most people to buy/sell large amounts of btc for USD at the moment combine to make it difficult to arbitrage. 
For someone in the US who buys in USD (if they even can right now given the problems all the exchanges are having) and then sells on bitchina he now has the problem of dealing with Yuan and getting it back into USD (not easy). For someone in China they would have to sell their btc buy dollars get those dollars onto a us xchange (good luck) then buy btc.
Given the lag in getting verified on most exchanges someone would have had to already be ready to arbitrage this before the price divergence appeared. I'm guessing that there are people who do this, but given how problematic it is to do anything on USD based exchanges they probably already exhausted there funds.
Somewhere some hedge fund manager is drooling thinking of all the free money he could make if he could convince his boss/IPC/investors to let him.

In order for bitcoin to be that valuable it will have to become a massive part of every day life. It would represent 20% of the total global money supply. In that scenario bitcoin will be the global reserve currency and transactions in dollars would likely be limited to the US. All of a sudden having a billion dollars US isn't nearly as beneficial as having a few thousand BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:05:30
Linking me to a site which gives exchange rates doesn't change the fact that China has strict capital controls making it difficult to take your money out of the country as an individual.
Also wiring money takes several days, arbitrage by its very nature has to happen quickly. So when you combine the volatility in bitcoin prices, with the delays in getting USD on exchanges, delays in getting your Yuan into USD, and delays getting your Yuan from bitchina to your Chinese bank it becomes an increasingly risky proposition. Arbitrage requires the ability to near transact between securities very quickly any delay adds increased risk and when you are talking about a commodity that goes through 50% price swings in a matter of hours, and delays that can last weeks it becomes very risky indeed.
As you can see from this thread there are a plethora of reasons why arbitrage isn't happening between these exchanges. No one of them is the "right" answer you are looking for.

You need to be very careful with opening a legitimate escrow service. IIRC their are a patchwork of legislative rules which vary by state (assuming you are in the US) as well as SEC regulations, since I assume you will have to register as a money transmitter. Escrow is an extremely highly regulated business, I don't know the details but even a cursory search reveals a hint at the intricacies involved. You are looking at a pretty significant initial capital investment just to get licensed, regulated, etc. Then you have minimum capital requirements (which I think start at 25k) that you have to prove that you keep in reserve.
Don't get me wrong I think this is a great idea and a service that bitcoin 100% needs if it is going to be successful. To do it 100% legally is going to require a lot of money and jumping through a ton of hoops. Currently most escrow companies are either insurance companies or subdivisions of/sponsored by insurance companies. Its not a business you see a lot of new entrants into because the barriers to entry are pretty high.
Best of luck to you though!

Isn't it easier for my PC to get hacked than coinbase? Im not trying to be an ass I'm honestly curious. 
IIRC every guide I've read about safely storing bitcoin says that if the computer you use to generate the private key is compromised by a virus or malware you can be screwed. The solution they give is go buy a cheap[ netbook and never connect it to the internet, that seems impractical for someone who isn't investing serious $$ in btc. 
I guess my question is which is safer, storing your btc on a web wallet with a relatively reputable company like coinbase, or storing them on your personal computer which may have malware, spyware, or viruses?

To those saying $1million is too high....1 million*21 million coins =21 trillion USD which IIRC would put it about twice the money supply of the US dollar. There is something like 100 trillion in total global M2 which would put bitcoin at 20% of that. Granted by the time this happens central banks will undoubtedly have increased m2 significantly (which has the twofold effect of decreasing the % of m2 that bitcoin represents and increasing the price of BTC in terms of fiat). Either way if this does come to pass suffice to say that we will be living in a very different world than we are in now.
Regardless I can almost guarantee that the writers at BI didn't even do the basic math I just did, which took me less than 2 minutes, they just pulled $1 million out of a hat because its a nice round number. Those guys are a joke.
