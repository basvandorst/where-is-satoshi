so if 100% of the bitcoins are mined, the price will continue going up or what?
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:11:33
so the price of bitcoin will no longer go up?

i dont think you can
made a quadriga account. 
transfer bitcoin from coinbase to gdax to wallet to quadriga and then sell if you want to.

@_date: 2017-12-10 05:48:37

@_date: 2017-12-24 20:00:45

@_date: 2017-12-10 05:52:30

@_date: 2017-11-29 08:24:43
What are your thoughts on the other currencies? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:33:12
I feel like an idiot for investing at 13 500 (cad) now 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:06:19
can you explain?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:30:16
Thank you so much for your response btw.
There is a fee associated with moving your coins out of coinbase and into the wallet, i can avoid that by moving it to gdax first, and then into my wallet. 
(quick question: when the bitcoin is in my wallet, its affected by the market correct?, right now i bought if for 13 thousand, couple months from now it could possibly be 0 or 15 thousands, and i could make that profit?) 
(2nd edit: GDAX processing takes forever, i even downloaded the app smh)
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:06:29
hold on
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:24:19
Why cant i sell my bitcoins on coinbase (in cad) 
i just bought some right now, what do i do. 
Someone please help 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:38:29
would there be something wrong with that process? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:48:23
if you have over 1000 invested its a good idea to have one, yes
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:35:01
should i just move my bitcoins to gdax then to exodus, and now the bitcoins are mine? and then when i need to sell them use something like quadrigaCX? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:03:12
is it possible (anything is possible, but realistically speaking) that one day we might look back and see that the other currencies pulled a "bitcoin"
