Would be interested in hearing how Nakamoto's is doing.

Most money laundering laws and know your customer regulations. I can think of OFAC and BSA off the top of my head
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:45:20
Yes, this is highly illegal and asking to be raided by the feds. Go with the BTM as they seem to have a legit operation
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:55:15
Disagree. Don't recommend doing the trading yourself unless you are ready to deal with the onerous compliance procedures and costs associated. The BTM seems like an elegant solution to that, while driving good traffic to you store.

the D machine is often out of cash. 3/5 times I've used it been out. Sold to the new bitcoin ATM on strip 3 times since its opened and its always stocked.

Wow! Will be shocked if Robocoin brand can survive this! Their best shot at any future revenue is a Libel suit that has .000000001% shot of success
Brutal guys, sorry for your dealings

Community rise! We should make this awesome

Can awilkinson make his $25k back in reddit tips??!?!? 
@_date: 2014-10-15 06:54:51
Although Robocoin may be crap, I tried using it there and it was clearly a problem with the wifi at the event. BitAccess demo was down too for same reason
@_date: 2014-08-10 20:19:14
There is now a 2-way bitcoin ATM on strip too 
Vegas is becoming the bitcoin tourist destination!
@_date: 2014-09-29 08:17:32
Great in general. Kind of sucks they are portraying it as being used by extortionists
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:30:41
Very good stuff Fred. Wish he spoke more.

This author Matt Villano I just learned is a freelancer. I encourage us to tip him in bitcoin to reward him and push him to write other high quality pieces in this space.

Lawsky actually exceeded my low expectations today

says 8am to midnight on operators website 
I swear I used it at 1am on a friday night. Maybe gift shop is open later on weekends

Link to BitBet Robocoin bankrupt by Jan 1, 2015?
@_date: 2014-09-25 08:51:53
Sounds like what everyone is saying about bitcoin now. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 04:16:17
Much better than Moneygram and such where you get dinged with fees on each send. Also, bitcoin has a much further reach. Not perfect but more options are better for consumers.

When this launches what does BTC price go to that month? 1000? 2000? 3000?
@_date: 2016-12-09 23:01:24
Interesting the timing of the casino targeting Chinese in Vegas and the addition of a BTM on the casino floor. Very cool.

Is there a way to send bitcoin inside the app? I would donate if they have or make this feature
@_date: 2016-12-09 23:05:20
Reason just did a podcast on this too. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:07:53
Yuge news for bitcoin! Incredible vision Vegas has to target Chinese money and open a Asian casino with a bitcoin ATM. Big steps for bitcoin in the mainstream. Surprised this is not bigger news in BTC community. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 04:01:16
You tried the Strip Robocoin? Different operator than the D and stocked everytime I have sold coin.
@_date: 2016-05-02 06:48:50
How could this be profitable then with only 1 machine charging 7%?
@_date: 2015-03-01 04:08:49
Be very careful on your compliance and legal. i looked into this with an attorney and as per FinCEN regulations a full time compliance officer is needed. This is obviously unrealistic for those operating BTMs but if they ever enforce fines and jail time are not in my interest. I know most of the current operators out there are risking this. 
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:49:41
The operator would be misusing the machine if it was a party to processing funds derived or intended to be used criminally.
@_date: 2016-05-18 18:08:13
Agreed. 
There are also benefits to living in a prosperous society where rule of law is strong (aka your rights to free speech and privacy are generally honored), property rights respected, corruption not ubiquitous, and money laundering is criminalized. Cost of doing business in a place like Manhattan. I'm sure Equatorial Guinea doesn't have much AML/KYC at their BTMs but you might not get some of the other benefits. 
Yikes, I realize now I've been sucked into a hardcore libertarian trollbox.

r/buttcoin is funny at times and offers a needed counter punch to the overzealousness that exists in r/bitcoin
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:22:37
Works great for me
@_date: 2015-10-15 08:21:17
I've looked into it and the setup and ongoing legal/compliance is overwhelmingly the biggest cost of business. Like running a mini bank. I talked to Coin Cloud here in Vegas about franchising a BTM. They used to offer a turnkey package but the CEO said they did away with it recently. Might be worth checking in with them anyways
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:22:05
Selling bitcoin helps with the remittance loop more IMO
@_date: 2016-05-19 04:23:07
ATMs still more anonymous
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:32:25
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:13:59
You mean a money laundering machine? 
@_date: 2016-05-18 17:23:23
To be honest there are a lot of new bitcoiners here that may not remember these guys. Here are a couple of highlights:
