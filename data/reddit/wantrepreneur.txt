@_date: 2013-11-27 16:17:02
hey man; 
XPM is still really new/hasn't been discovered yet.
transaction times are 1minute, even faster than LTC.
mining simultaneously helps solve prime number chains, the first coin to have a useful output.
its also developed by Sunny King, same dev as PPC and the ONLY dev to still be anonymous (BTC dev is already getting harassed to change the algorithm)
the automatic difficulty adjustment every block is also key, makes for a much smoother diff increase rather than just abruptly havling it every few years.
lastly, LTC market cap is over 40x the size of XPM (coinmarketcap.com), so figure theres no way it will maintain a 40x growth rate (same reason people are moving from BTC -&gt; LTC)
make sense kinda-&gt;?

consider the timeframe you'll hold them for.
if longterm, what difference is 24 or 27 if they'll push $100 and beyond?
otherwise, you 're from captchas to timing the market •v•
@_date: 2013-03-10 04:39:39

good point, was only joking.
@_date: 2013-01-29 13:54:23

either way, cheers!

volatility is expected for a $10b currency taking on trillion dollar global markets.

litecoin may seem clone-ish;
though primecoin (xpm) tends to impress with its prime number applications.

@_date: 2013-08-09 01:15:46
