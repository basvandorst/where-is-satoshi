The problem that I have when explaining bitcoin to people is that they don't understand "what it's backed by". I have to go in to proof of work and computational power and such in order to get past this hurdle. Does anyone else have a simple solution?

Prepare for the inevitable hacker that rips all the coins from their site.
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:26:04
It's just the value of currency. Like another user stated, 10000 yen isn't a whole lot. Also, it might sound better if you pronounce it "thirty-four seventy" instead of "three-thousand four hundred seventy"

I guess my question is what steps would I take in the case of large sums of money being added to my account. How do I contact them and say that they need a small percent of it? (or can I just tell them "iz all good man"?)
EDIT: Let me rephrase that: What are the necessary steps I should take before transferring a large amount to my bank account?

That website is all user-driven. You have to type in your order manually to that website, then later update it of you receive it. Some people just add a bullshit order of like 30 MiniSCs and say it was never delivered.

They had a huge problem a while ago. Hackers were involved also selling price dropping to 0.5. Not going back there. Oh and on top of that, I bought a large amount of BTC, and in the process, my wire transfer was denied and I lost $500.
