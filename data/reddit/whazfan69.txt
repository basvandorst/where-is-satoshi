Nearly every example of Bitcoin remittance so far is more expensive then the **best available** fiat alternatives.  The problem is the costs in and out of fiat at each end and the crappy exchange rates from low liquidity at regional exchanges.
In the long run remittance will be awesome with Bitcoin, but it's one of those things that only takes shape after Bitcoin becomes ubiquitous.  It's really not capable of leading the charge, it's more like the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

Litecoin is not only more volatile because of its smaller market cap, but it's also just as prone to whale abuse, what about that 300k dump a few weeks back on btc-e?
Get out of litecoin while you can, it needs to gain 35% on the year just to break even against miners, there isn't enough new money floating around in it right now.  Maybe if BTC rallies big take a 2nd look at LTC but right now it's headed for pain.

Every country that Coinbase has expanded to outside of the US uses SEPA, and SEPA transfers are free or at most a few dollars, either way much less than 2%.  Also, TransferWise is .5% and supports many countries.
The only way BTC will make a dent in remittance is if you can build liquid exchanges and/or a BTC economy in 2nd and 3rd world countries and that are accessible to the local population.  You have to go where most of the population is unbanked and then fulfill that need with the unique features of Bitcoin.  That, unfortunately, is far easier said than done.  
What Coinbase has done here is not a huge remittance play.  Bitcoin is, for the moment, a 1st world novelty item.  Coinbase has just positioned themselves to sell more Bitcoins to geeks and libertarian-minded individuals in the EU.  I'm not saying it's not progress, but you need to scale your expectations for immediate results appropriately.

Where's Joe Newbie market buying on Coinbase at any price to take us higher from here?  He seems to be absent from the party for now.  And because he's not here, there's no FOMO, as a veteran why rush to buy when you know miners are desperate to sell sub 400 regardless?

Paypal is not being integrated directly into consumer Bitcoin wallets.  The integration is for merchants only, and not all merchants, just those who "opt-in" and who sell digital (downloadable) goods like video games, music, ebooks.

The issue here is one of infrastructure and regulation.  Say for example you wanted to reverse the Bitpay model using a debit card that works anywhere, not just BTC focused merchants.  Well the issue you would run into is that these transactions would be tied to a merchant POS system that operates on the interchange network, and thus subject to fees.  Right now almost every installed POS in the country is setup to transact over these existing networks.  There are also issues with KYC/AML etc... that create friction for direct sales of BTC at the B2C level.
I have no doubt your desired reality will eventually happen, but it's not like somebody can just roll out a product overnight that overcomes needed merchant adoption and regulatory guidance.
@_date: 2014-07-30 14:49:44
It's not that you're wrong, it's that the negativity is generally speaking short-sighted.  If you're in a low margin business, such as retail gasoline or online electronics, credit card fees can really eat into your profits.  Bitcoin is a headache, it lacks POS integration, etc... but in a hypothetical scenario where it becomes even mildly popular, it has the potential to pay off big.  It's for this reason that merchants are willing to go near it.
The harder sell is consumers imo.
@_date: 2014-08-09 18:53:41
It's not optimal in the sense that markets are forward looking and attempt to be predictive using available information.  If you mine in GHash up until there's an issue, then we have no way of knowing the elasticity of Ghash's makeup, and to what extent hashing power will or will not shift away.  This essentially places a confidence/risk discount on the price of Bitcoin, so you are mining for fewer dollars in the end.
The real problem here is a tragedy of the commons.  Even after knowing that mining on Ghash / other large pool hurts the price, without being able to precisely quantify that price discount or know to what extent people would follow you in exiting the pool, you cannot have confidence behind a decision to leave; you start to feel that you would only hurt yourself because others would not follow.
@_date: 2014-05-03 10:12:51
Sounds about right.  The issue isn't merchant adoption, it's consumer adoption, and the incentive for most consumers is small for most product categories.  We live in a credit addicted society and most credit card companies are passing through interchange fees directly to the consumer already in the form of cash back rewards.  They make it all back and then some with late payments and interest charges.
I do think Bitcoin has a bright future, but success will take time and will come from many different vectors, and certainly not all of it related to daily transactions between consumers and merchants.

We appreciate the effort saizai. The $100 cap is a bit depressing, but maybe by 2016 audit tools will be stronger or perhaps registered bitcoin addresses will become a thing and then we can move past cash equivalency.  For now, any step in the direction of mass adoption at any scale is a good thing imo.
Also, I think guidance from the top down is necessary.  The last thing we need is more negative publicity around bitcoin as some kind of scapegoat for large scale direct contributions to politicians from the shadows.  I'd much rather see the narrative of bitcoin donations coming from the little guys, in small amounts, to support a more populist narrative.

Somebody already reached out a few weeks ago to the lawyer working on the Winklevoss ETF and the response was basically "no idea, SEC can take as long as they want to approve or deny it, probably another year". [paraphrasing]
As for the Secondmarket exchange (not an ETF), Lawsky hinted earlier this week that NYDFS has been in communication with some groups looking to open regulated exchanges in New York and he thinks one or two might open in the first half of next year.  These exchanges will be nice to have, but they wont be nearly as accessible as an ETF for the mass market.
Neither of these things are likely to come this year.  The guy is just spouting off hearsay speculation that people have been making for months now and which has been refuted by more up to date information.

Take any advice you get from this sub with a grain of salt because it's a very biased place.  That said, I think it's a fairly good long-term investment around this price level.  
The main utility of Bitcoin is international transfer, evading capital controls, and buying drugs / gambling.  Bitcoin and its price will continue to grow as these practices grow.  The reason the price is down so much on the year is that:
1) People overestimated the growth rate of its adoption
2) People overestimated its value proposition for normal payments such as online shopping
There's a lot of other things going on, but generally speaking the selling pressure is beginning to subside.  The final concern for the year I think is tax loss selling and possibly last minute need of money for Christmas shopping, but generally speaking I expect 2015 to be a good year so it's not a bad time to get in.

The technological innovation in Bitcoin is its trustless, decentralized nature that allows it to exist without permission from a central authority.  Cryptography and the Blockchain allow Bitcoin to exist as a nationless, digital currency for the new age, and I think over a very long period of time people will start to see the value in this.
Bitcoin is not better at sending data from point A to point B.  Doing so is essentially instant and free anyway.  It doesn't really cost credit card companies much of anything to process your transaction from a purely technical standpoint.  Now add on to this the value-added services and leverage that credit card companies have.  They can provide a consumer with the ability to build their credit, earn rewards points, and spend money they do not yet have.  Customers turn around and demand card acceptance from merchants, who capitulate in order to retain business and keep up sales volumes.  Credit card companies can also collect fees from merchants because merchants know if they don't accept card XY or Z that their customers will shop somewhere else.  
So credit card companies are generating revenue from interest via irresponsible consumers, and fees from merchants.  They are passing a portion of this back to consumers in the form of rewards.  They also offer chargeback and fraud protection, but with proper policies and procedures and automation technology the cost of providing these services diminishes greatly with economies of scale.  Are there hidden costs to consumers in the form of higher prices from merchants?  Yes, there are, but those costs are subsidized by all consumers (cash paying, debit, etc..) and likely equate to less than the rewards points earned back by the CC customer, either way it's so obfuscated that they're oblivious to it.
tdlr; Economies of scale and alternative revenue sources give credit card companies major advantages.  However this is an apples to oranges comparison because Bitcoin is not designed purely as a payment network, it's something much greater than that, a nationless and hard to manipulate / monopolize store of value.

[**rebit.ph is in fact 1-2% cheaper**](
I don't strongly disagree with anything you've said, just saying there are some silver linings.  One problem that Bitcoin does solve is the need to include an intermediary in a transaction when both parties fully trust each other.  Right now the cost of bad actors is spread across all parties and transactions.
People on this sub greatly overestimate the value proposition of Bitcoin in everyday legal commerce, but that doesn't mean you can just call it useless.  It's greatest potential may be in the illicit domain, but there are still some use cases in legal commerce that make sense.
@_date: 2014-06-24 04:36:37
I wasn't really arguing against inflation as a policy target, I was pointing out that inflation in the supply of Bitcoin can not really be seen as a transaction cost if you look at Bitcoin as more than just a payment network.  Even if you do look at it as a cost though, it's worth pointing out that this situation is likely a temporary growing pain.
Thanks for the brief economics lesson though :)
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:49:23
Nobody can offer you 5% discount over the long term, stop dreaming.  Credit cards cost my business 2% net everything, debit cards 1%, and all of those are pass through to the customer in the form of rewards points which they love.

I honestly hope it's across the board, because that would give PayPal a huge financial incentive to push Bitcoin integration, namely, they can make a ton more on fees compared to credit cards where they essentially perform fee splitting.
As much as I appreciate merchants getting low fees (I'm a Bitcoin merchant myself), consumer adoption is key and rewards points don't come out of thin air.
For the merchants who really want to keep fees down, they can work on a more direct integration.

Two well known whales on Tradingview had a battle of sorts, one was heavy short from 350'ish and pushing down the market by force, while the other had a lot of fiat on the same exchange.  The bullwhale trader defended 331 heavily and ultimately flexed a 16,000 coin buywall.  The bearwhale trader then realized he was in a losing battle and began closing his shorts by the thousands, and that's the story of today's rally.
They are traders, not some secret billionaire or hedge fund. This does not signal the end of the downtrend per se, but it serves as a reminder to bears that they need to keep their greed in check and not over commit because there's plenty of fiat lying around ready to punish.

I paid roughly $1200 for a brand new legacy bank ATM just a few months ago.
However to reply to OP, the cost of a Bitcoin ATM has nothing to do with the cost of the parts, and everything to do with low volume and low demand driven by lack of Bitcoin popularity and also, in the USA, licensing requirements and lack of regulatory clarity.  Hurdles like this mean demand is probably 5-20 units per month, and what kind of business can operate like that without huge markups?
Any buyer looking to "retrofit" an ATM needs to learn about the hardware, and also write software capable of interfacing with that hardware and also the exchanges.

I think they're both doing well.  Coinbase decided to focus on the US market, and it was a solid choice, because at least as far as merchant adoption goes we are leading the charge.
Bitpay went for a more international approach, and they also seem to have a lot more assets working on software development and POS terminal integrations.  This is a long game strategy for sure, but it might pay off huge next year.  I also feel compelled to point out the contributions that Bitpay is making to open source related Bitcoin ecosystem development, including their multisig wallet.
Frankly, I'm glad to have both companies as ambassadors for Bitcoin.  The strong influx of KYC/AML policy growing in Coinbase is a bit of a concern, but hey that was to be expected I guess.

My gas station accepts Bitcoin.  We get maybe one customer a month (out of roughly 30,000+ transactions) so that's not too impressive.  The main issue is lack of POS integration with the pumps and things of that nature, i.e. double entry by cashiers and customers have to come inside the store and stand in line to pay.
When the day comes where I can fully integrate Bitcoin with my retail POS system and it works at the pumps, then I'll make a sincere marketing push with my customers.  For now though, it's too cumbersome of an experience for me to push it in earnest.
I really hope Bitpay or Coinbase is working with Dresser Wayne, Verifone, and/or Gilbarco to make this a thing.

It's true; if there was a truly compelling reason for consumers to use Bitcoin instead of credit cards, well then we'd already be on the moon.
That said, there's plenty of room for Bitcoin to grow in the right areas.  How about rent payments and condo dues?  The unbanked, both at home and abroad.  B2B transactions where the CC fee is passed to the buyer.  Also remittances and international payments.  The list goes on.
@_date: 2014-08-28 15:10:48
It's a valid question, but consider the impact of millions of people/businesses holding even small quantities of spending money in Bitcoin instead of fiat.
Pretend you have $1000 in discretionary spending money from a recent paycheck and decided to convert that into Bitcoin (at a hypothetical cost much lower than today's 1% via Coinbase, perhaps free if paid directly in BTC from employer).
Now assume you will be spending this $1000 over the next two weeks until the next paycheck, but until then you are holding it in BTC form instead of fiat.  If you spent it evenly, this would mean you held on average $500 of BTC but spent it as you would cash meant for short-term expenses.  In this case, you are holding Bitcoin, but not hoarding it.
As more and more merchants become willing to exchange goods and services for BTC, and as competition drives down BTC/Fiat conversion costs, this scenario becomes more viable for larger numbers of people.  As to why somebody might do it, well the biggest reason would be that BTC is deflationary, so if it becomes popular then it trends heavily towards increasing value.  Of course there is always risk with that, but if dealing with discretionary spending then the risk can be managed by simply cutting back at the bars that weekend or whatever if something goes wrong.
Of course this doesn't even touch on all of the very valid uses of Bitcoin in inflationary economies, remittance markets, instant B2B transactions, etc...
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:13:48
As a merchant in multiple business types and locations, I can say that chargebacks are a pain in the butt, but not a major expense.

@_date: 2014-06-18 08:20:11
Sure, there's a theory that Bitcoin would grow as a payment network but not as a store of value.  The idea is that Bitcoin would operate at a level that is not obvious to consumers, and fiat &lt;--&gt; btc conversions would be occurring over short time frames only when confirmations are taking place.  In this scenario, the value of BTC basically settles around the simultaneous transactional needs of the network + modest storage in spending wallets.  Personally I find this outcome to be fairly unlikely.
Another scenario would be Bitcoin failing as a consumer / international payment network and simply remaining a store of value among "bitcoin bugs", basically a commodity for techies and bitcoin hipsters.

Sadly, I think this is correct, and it will result in a good portion of the leftover funds leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem in a potentially violent manner.
The best hope is that the first in line creditors realize the folly of a mass liquidation and convince the trustee to repay debts in BTC, for a smooth transition rather than a violent liquidation.

You can guarantee the fees in Bitcoin are between 0-1%, and my guess is that their actual cost

Standard interchange processing rates are around 2.75% for online transactions, but closer to 2% for some high volume retail applications like gas stations.  I think a reasonable assumption is that Dell pays around 1.5% in CC fees, maybe .7% if it's a debit card.

Bitcoin is first and foremost a store of wealth; it's closest analogy is gold. When merchants accept Bitcoin for payment, it reinforces the idea that Bitcoin has value because businesses are willing to exchange goods and services for it.  Over time, the network effect continues to grow, and more people become comfortable with the idea of storing some of their wealth in the form of Bitcoin (especially in countries with high inflation).  You can view merchant acceptance as a prerequisite of sorts, it doesn't create an immediate demand, but it helps to quietly make the public comfortable with it.

Both debit cards and credit cards incur fees on the interchange network.  Even though it's not a credit card, the "VISA" on your card is there for a reason, the card is being accepted wherever VISA is, and that carries with it a transaction cost.
Merchants normally eat this fee for you because the item they are selling you has been marked up.  In this case though, you can see why Circle is not in a position to eat fees on what is essentially an at-cost currency conversion over visa's network.

So I don't use Bitpay, but I'll throw this out there as an alternative for you.
My store uses a [Coinkite terminal]( which works out nicely in a lot of brick and mortar retail situations because it prints a receipt with a one time QR code on it.  As a restaurant this is nice because you can slip it in that little foldable leather holder just like any other bill.  The terminal can be programmed to spit out paper confirmations to acknowledge payment (including zero-conf), or you can have a tablet open to the account to confirm receipt, either one works.
The whole thing is a lot more noob friendly for your employees, and a bit less clunky than carrying around tablets.  That said, maybe it's not best for you, it kind of depends on the experience you are aiming for.  Also, tips might be an issue, not sure on the best way to handle that.

The price of BTC goes down or stays flat, borrower may be able to repay but there is still a decent chance they were just a scammer to begin with.

If the merchant has proof that a transaction has occurred and product was rendered, they can fight off a charge back.  My store dies about 35000 transactions per month and we have maybe 2 or 3 chargebacks.  Often times it was a legit mistake on our end, not attempted fraud. 
I think there are very specific use cases online where fraud is a big concern, but be careful not to overestimate this as some kind of major expense to most retailers.

Congrats!  I have a question if you don't mind.
I assume the inflows far exceed the outflows, that is to say more people are interested in sending money to family in ph than vice versa.  Wouldn't this require you to find buyers for BTC?  Who are you selling the BTC to?  Do you act as your own exchange, or do you have a rich benefactor looking to acquire BTC who is buying everything you collect?  I guess what I'm really asking is if your model is sustainable if this rapid growth continues; will you be able to keep unloading BTC at a reasonable price in your local market?
P.S. For anyone that cares I did a price comparison of Rebit to PayPal for sending USD, to my surprise [Rebit came out on top.](

It's not in their standard promos, which reinforces my point that it's a niche play.  They might do a BTC specific deal, but anything above a 1-2% discount (beyond what they offer other customers during Black Friday) is a subsidy, and not sustainable long term.
I just get miffed at the circlejerk around here that implies Bitcoin is some massive godsend for retailer profit margins (5%+) and that huge deals will fall from the sky that'll make credit card paying customers wish they had BTC.  If it happens, it will be for ideological or short-term strategic reasons, not sustainable market forces.  Credit card fees for major retailers are significantly less than 2%

The question is, to what extent is Paypal sharing the fees it collects with other entities.  Banks, credit card companies, etc... all take their cut in most PayPal transactions, and Bitcoin represents a way to cut them out.
Convenience and consumer protection are still important in commerce, and Bitcoin is still lacking in this respect for now.  So PayPal can bring these plus its massive user base to the table, and Bitcoin can bring its subsidized low-fee network (debasement through block rewards).  I look forward to seeing this play out.

Now if only a business could get "zero confirmation" notice within 30 seconds or less, instead of 1-9 minutes...
It's a tough hurdle for a retail business like Tim Horton's to let a transaction go on blind faith for 60 seconds or more, even with a zero confirmation policy.  They can't make the customer wait but they have nothing to go on for the first minute or so...  The exception is like inter-company processing, say a coinbase customer wallet sending to a coinbase merchant etc, but that's not really the bitcoin network...  
We need to find a better solution for mass retail adoption.  I wish merchants could pay for faster transactions if they wanted, putting the burden on the buyer at first glance makes little sense.  I doubt this rumor is true other than maybe some kind of limited test trial.

As I said, many chargebacks are actually legitimate, so not all of those dollars were real fraud, some of it is customer/merchant remediation.  Also, 11.8 billion out of 4+ trillion in transaction volume represents a fraction of a percent overall.
Yes, online fraud is a bigger concern in some specific online use cases, but steps are taken every day to reduce the impact of this, some of those things were mentioned in the article.  What about cases where you send Bitcoin to an online merchant and they fail to send you a product, or the product is defective, what then?  If we only used Bitcoin, what would be the year cost of merchant fraud?Customer/Merchant remediation doesn't come free, sometimes the trusted 3rd party is actually useful to have.
I'm not saying Bitcoin isn't useful and I'm not saying there are not some cool solutions to some of these problems, but it's hard for me to accept it as some kind of vastly superior payment tech.  It's a push, not pull system, and that has both benefits and drawbacks.  
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:03:51
I think the best solution would be for your company to hold a small amount of BTC, roughly equivalent to 2-3 days worth of BTC related returns.  At the time of purchase, the customer should know that in the event of a refund, the amount of BTC that will be returned to the customer is market price USD equivalent.  So if BTC went up from the time they bought to the time they return, they get less BTC back, but they still get their return in BTC and it's still the same dollar amount so there is no risk for them.  This strips away any incentive to game the system, but also frames the relationship in a way that the BTC customer should find fair and equitable.  I know some customers can be a pain, but I think the vast majority of BTC users out there do not expect a full 1-to-1 BTC refund; all retailers are pricing in dollar equivalents, so you will be well within the market's expectations.  Don't forget that you will also have some goodwill from being an early adopter.
Now of course your company will have to take a small risk on the BTC that it owns, however if the total amount of BTC you are holding is fairly small as described above (daily BTC returns x 3), then this might be manageable.  Keep in mind that under this scenario, you are not taking a risk on timing issues related to price volatility and returns, but rather a risk on the total value of the BTC as a long term holding.  You could perhaps try to insure against long tail events that might otherwise result in a total loss, but other than that just leave it on the balance sheet and record gains and losses at the end of the accounting period. If BTC drops a lot, you may need to purchase more BTC to maintain pace with returns, but if it goes up then you can actually pull money out.  In the beginning, the size of your risk will be small relative to your company size, and if Bitcoin grows then your $ holding of BTC will increase but the odds of a value drop also goes down because it means BTC is catching fire, and also because a larger market cap is usually correlated with stability.

They wont be going after you, they'll be going after the company and indirectly your investment.  This means the only companies you can invest in are those willing to break the law and are somehow out of the reach of the SEC, requirements that considerably reduce the number of potential good investments, and they are also more likely to be in a position to scam you operating from the shadows.  This may work in a few cases, but it kills the model overall until the law changes yet again.

I own a gas station, so I can relate to this a little bit.  The cost of a credit card transaction to a gas station owner is 2%, lower than most retailers, as they get special rates specifically for the business type.  The cost of a debit transaction is 1%.  Thus, since the 20-cent surcharge for credit actually nets a roughly 4-5% higher take than a cash paying customer, store owners are actually hoping people use credit cards for payment.
The most likely outcome is continued use of surcharges for credit based transactions in low margin businesses like gas stations.  This allows you to give discounts to those who really care, and extract the most amount of money from those that don't.  Every customer has different habits and price sensitivities, and generally speaking a retailer that isn't living hand to mouth has no reason not to meet the needs of both.  Bitcoin has a place in here as well, but to suggest it will be forced in the way you describe, well I strongly doubt it.
At my store we do a 10 cent surcharge, but despite that half of my customers still pay via credit.  I don't mean to tell you how to run your own business, but my guess is if you started accepting credit cards today you'd see an increase in business after six months or so.
@_date: 2014-10-27 01:56:11
Brick and Mortar pay lower rates than online stores, which it sounds like you are.  The reason I do so many transactions per day is I'm a truckstop, so it's a high volume of transactions with low margins.
Worldpay is who I use for merchant services.  It's unlikely you'll get sub 2% if you're web based, unless you're a huge company.

The savings are 1-3%, not 3-6%.  I should know, I'm a retail merchant who accepts Bitcoin and passes on the same discount that I give to my cash paying customers.  Also, as you said, credit card fees are basically passed through to the customer in the form of rewards points, so the discount would basically break even against that.

All good points, I think the one thing I would say though is that BTC is fundamentally more than just the payment network, it is also a currency.  You do not add annual global inflation on to the transaction cost for Visa, so why add the annual inflation of BTC as a transaction cost?
If BTC reaches a point where it's at $100,000 per, then mining for block rewards will continue to dramatically outshine profits from transaction fees, up until some future point where the burden of transactions are insignificant relative to the technology of the time and miners can survive on those alone.
I like to think of the yearly debasement of BTC not as a transaction cost, but as a joint investment by all holders towards building a network capable of competing with other payment schemes at some far out future point, and also to enhance the security of BTC as a store of value.

@_date: 2014-06-17 18:25:01
Not 100% related, but a random thought came to me as I read your post.  
Generally speaking credit card companies pass through their interchange fees to consumers in the form of cash back rewards and points.  This effectively makes the zero fee or low fee structure of the BTC network not very competitive from the consumer facing standpoint, and there is little incentive for consumers to make a switch in tender methods because of it.  Credit card companies make most of their money on annual fees, interest, and late fees.  Coinbase is not currently positioned to operate under a similar model.
There is however room to play with in the world of Bitcoin.  One is the natural debasement of the currency that takes place from mining.  Right now the value derived from this is basically horded by the biggest miners, but what if a portion of these gains were selectively targeted as rebates / rewards to consumers in specific transactions?  If over time the largest processors in the BTC community also became the largest miners, then this might create the opportunity for targeted rewards that could outpace the best offerings credit card companies have to offer.  There would have to be controls and limits on eligible transactions to stop fraud / abuse obviously, but such controls are already common outside the world of Bitcoin, and would not be a tough sell to consumers if through managed services like Coinbase.
I am basically proposing a subsidy targeted at consumers to push adoption. This debasement subsidy already exists, and is passed on to miners, manufacturers, and power companies in full.  Ideally we would develop a mechanism to pass through a portion of it to consumers, either through direct investment by processors or by some clever social engineering among miners.  A possible starting point would be for Coinbase to sponsor a pool that has fees, but all fees are pass through as consumer rewards under tight controls.  That would likely be a rough start, you'd have to make direct investment or partner with a major miners to really make it work, with the challenge being getting all stakeholders to take the long view on the importance of consumer adoption.

The follow up to your point, somewhat implicit in my original post, is whether or not exchange rates make the arbitrage expensive enough that Rebit's costs eventually go up because they are forced to sell BTC at slightly higher prices to make the arb worthwhile, or simply perform the arb on themselves.  Local buyers in the Philippines looking to acquire BTC would be a far more efficient offloading method.  I don't know whether or not their current cost structure is based on the former or the latter.  My OP assumes the latter, but with concerns about scalability, whereas you mentioned the former scales with ease.

It's adds legitimacy to Bitcoin, it allows people to realize that it actually has value, knowing that some other party will trade them goods and services for it.
This allows one to trust that Bitcoin can be used as a store of value, and that's what really drives up the price.  As more people begin to trust it, so too will organizations (made up of people) and eventually they will hold / pay suppliers with it also.

Short answer is whatever it takes, my business cannot function without accepting all payment methods.
The real question for me is, what percentage of my credit paying customers pay the surcharge because they want rewards points and/or rely on credit for purchasing power, and what percentage do so simply because they don't like to handle cash?  The latter, it seems to me, is ripe for Bitcoin adoption, and gas stations are a good vector because of the high ticket sizes.
I'm bullish long term, but when I talk to my customers I realize there's a lot of mental barriers we still need to break down, and it's gonna take awhile.

You're required to pay a 2.9% interchange fee when using a credit card through circle, according to a review posted [here](  That said, having had some personal experience with interchange fees, I'm willing to bet that Circle's actual interchange cost is closer to 2.5%, so this is a potentially unpublicized revenue source for them; not that I have any problem with them making a little money.

Profit is linked to overall demand, if consumers go to a competitor because they accept a desired form of payment then that affects profits.  That's why tons of businesses worldwide accept credit cards despite the merchant fees, or why Apple Pay is making any headway at all with their additional fees on top of what's already out there.
Cost of training is a concern, I'm not disputing that; I'm simply pointing out that the cost of the training would be well worth it if consumers had a real reason to spend Bitcoin over a credit card.  For the most part, they don't.

I think a good portion of people and miners don't want to see Zerocoin implemented directly into btc, because it would likely make regulation like Bitlicense look like a walk in the park.  The invested players want to see BTC go mainstream to cash in, not take it back underground as part of a philosophical movement.
Zerocash as its own altcoin (supposedly 1-3 months away) is probably the best candidate for a private / anonymous currency.  Plenty of other alts are also working on their own version of anonymity, too many to list here, but Zerocash is probably a technological breakthrough compared to them.

Just to be fair to your question I went ahead and checked into this a bit more.  The goto company I always reference when discussing remittance is [TransferWise]( but since they do not yet serve the Philippines, I think the next best option for a comparison is probably PayPal.
**Using PayPal and sending from USA:**
Cost to send 50,000 PHP = $1145, Cost to send 10,000 PHP = $229
**Using Rebit and sending from USA using Coinbase / Circle (Bank Account linked):**
Cost to send 50,000 PHP = 3.39640700 BTC = $1,126, 
Cost to send 10,000 PHP = 0.67928200 BTC = $225
All exchange rates were compared within seconds of each other.  Final verdict, Rebit.ph was infact slightly cheaper than Paypal, by about 1.5%.  Not sure how well things would have gone from a country/currency with less Bitcoin market liquidity, but props to them on the USD &lt;-&gt; PHP.
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:00:47
Lots of credit cards offer 1.5% cash back or 2% in points.  These interchange fees are essentially pass through.
The sad fact is that Bitcoin can at best break even in terms of true costs.  The best solution in my opinion would be for merchant processors like Bitpay and Coinbase to also become miners, and perhaps fund targeted consumer rewards from proceeds from mining.  
Right now we all pay for a roughly 10% debasement per year directly to miners, I wish we had a mechanism to push a fraction of this 800 million towards consumers.

It's essentially allows for bitcoin sales from a storefront as opposed to an ATM.  The Coinkite terminal has features to pull down live exchange rates, let you pre-program fees or markups, and buy/sell BTC as needed.
The idea is that if you are in a retail location with existing staff, then why buy a $30,000 ATM machine in order to get buy/sell capability.  Instead, purchase the exchange enabled Coinkite terminal for less than $1000, and then it's simply a matter of training.
It's a nice idea, and I think it has a role to play, but be warned for U.S. customers you are still subject to KYC/AML laws and a retailer would most likely need to apply for money exchange licenses at both the state and federal level, same as with any bitcoin ATM.

The mining is going faster than it would normally because of strong growth in the hash rate outpacing the difficulty adjustments.  The market is aware that this is happening, most notably because miners have more coins to sell to the market over shorter time frames.  To answer your question, nothing stops, miners just keep on truckin'.
In the short run it increases supply and puts some downward pressure on prices, however it's only one variable of price and there are plenty of other market forces at work in determining the value of a Bitcoin.

Yup, the reserve requirements are a joke.  If a user wants to store on an exchange and wants proof of reserves that's one thing, but banking should have a place in the Bitcoin world too.  One might even argue that the revenue streams open to normal banking operations are critical to building the value proposition of Bitcoin to consumers, because we would be able to offer the same type of cash back rewards while also being cheaper for merchants, and not have to choose one or the other.

eGifter is giving 2% back on CC purchases, 4% back on Paypal, and 6% on BTC.  They've also said that the promotion may be temporary.
The simple fact is that generally speaking credit cards pass their interchange fees through to consumers in full with rewards.  1.5 - 2% in interchange fees vs 1.5 - 2% cash back.  Where they make all the money is on annual fees, late charges, interest, etc...

Brick and Mortar merchant here, do 1100 transactions per day, average rate 1.9%, includes all interchange fees as my rate is interchange + .02 cents per transaction.
What you don't seem to understand is you're the exception, not the rule.  The vast majority of credit card commerce operates below 2.5%, debit cards below 1.5%.
For some merchants, especially non-online ones, passing on discounts is not as easy as you make it out to be.  You have POS issues, signage space concerns, marketing, customer confusion, employee training.  1-2% may be more trouble than it's worth, depending on the business.
If an online retailer, sure, throw in an automatic discount.  That said, lots of customers get 1-2% back from their credit card rewards anyways...

The short answer is no, the merchant has no idea you're even paying with Bitcoin at all.  The transaction is sent over the interchange network, not the bitcoin network.  This is simply Xapo acting like a bank that issues a debit card, with your deposited BTC acting like dollars in your checking account.  
My guess would be the merchant is eating a 1-3% fee depending on the type of business they are, and you are probably going to eat a 1% fee [my speculation] on the BTC / USD conversion that Xapo performs on your behalf when they sell BTC on the exchange to repay themselves in fiat.
Personally I see very little value in this offering from Xapo, except maybe the ability to hold more of your disposable income in BTC form because it is more readily spendable.  At that point, you are hoping that gains in the value of BTC will out pace the fee structure associated with using the Xapo card on a regular basis as you keep paying conversion fees on BTC/USD exchange.

The most likely explanation is the increased use of Bitcoin as a payment method instead of just an asset that you hodl.  Think about how many more transactions some Bitcoin users now engage in than before since the rise of Dell, Expedia, Newegg, Gyft, etc...
The growth of transactions on the Bitcoin network does not necessarily correlate to an increased user base, at least not proportionately.  Prior to major retailers accepting Bitcoin, the most common thing to do with it was hodl it in cold storage, or trade it on an exchange (where it sits in exchange cold storage).  Now people are using it for more transactional purposes.  This doesn't really help the price by itself, because it gets converted back into fiat immediately and so has a high velocity, but the transaction counts go up.
**tldr;** The nature of Bitcoin usage changed slightly, and the rising transaction counts overstate the growth in the Bitcoin user base.

So they solicited non-accredited investors for money without performing any due diligence.  This is illegal, and it's the same reason kickstarter projects offer token incentives instead of real equity.  Is the law moronic?  Probably, but it's still the law of the land for now.
Just as a quick add on, any private US companies raising funds on altcoins or future sidechains that peg coins to equity ownership or revenue streams are also quite likely illegal, and investors should consider this risk ahead of time.

The problem is that those 5% and 10% discounts are not actually sustainable, they are just marketing promotions to draw in Bitcoin lovers.  The real savings from not using credit cards for a merchant is about 2%, and that 2% is generally speaking passed on to the consumer by credit card companies as cash back rewards etc...  The more widespread merchant adoption becomes, the less sustainable a 5% discount is.

Except most major retailers pay about 1.5% - 2% in CC fees, and plenty of credit cards (in the US) now pass through to consumers rewards of 1.5% - 2% cash back.  Merchant fees on Debit are &lt;1%
2% likely tops represents the long term, matured discount rate a store could offer to a customer for using Bitcoin instead of a credit card.  To do this they'll need special marketing materials, employee training, and they'll also have to give up all the money they would have saved on merchant fees.  After adding all this confusion it would still only be equal to the pass through rewards of a good credit card.  Stores could be offering a 1% discount for debit, 2% for cash, yet rarely except at a gas station do you see such a thing, and there's a reason for that, it's generally not worth the hassle.
Bitcoin promotions &gt; 2% are mostly just for show, trying to grab customer loyalty from the zealots.  It's not sustainable in the long run.
@_date: 2014-11-25 15:18:14
Because they don't pay 3% in fees, more like half that.  As for the 1.5% in savings, a portion of that likely goes to Coinbase, and then the rest I'm sure they would like to keep.  What's the point in using your marketing space to advertise a ~1% discount?

A big issue is the lack of cost savings.  Large transactions in the traditional banking system tend to carry a low cost.  If as a business you wanted to make a $50,000 payment to a supplier, you'd spend ~$500 acquiring Bitcoins, or close to zero for ACH push/pull.
Where Bitcoin shines here would be speed, but the use cases where this matters is limited I think.

You don't necessarily need a stable price for bitcoin to work, because transactions peg instantly to the stability of the default fiat currency, and price setting is based on the stable medium of exchange, i.e. retailers price in dollars and adjust to BTC and price discovery takes place outside of the bitcoin ecosystem.

My interpretation is that he thinks ASIC chips will begin to "top out", in so far as efficiency gains from R&amp;D will begin to see substantial diminishing returns.  Once this happens, the trend in the industry will be to revert back to selling miners as hardware to individuals, specifically those with access to "free power" (in the sense that somebody else is paying for it).
The basic premise is that irrational miners / leechers will over time price maximally efficient rational mining operations out of the market.  This can only happen once the massive competitive advantage from each R&amp;D cycle stops producing a next generation ASIC chip that is orders of magnitude superior to its predecessor.  He is forecasting this will eventually happen when he refers to future ASICs as "commodities".

A couple of things to be concerned about.
1.  US securities laws are more expansive than you might think, even to non-US based companies.
2.  High ratio of scamming / poor execution
3.  Most businesses will have to convert a decent portion of the BTC they raise into fiat to cover operating costs.  If BTC goes up significantly, then their ability to repay you in BTC goes down, or if they are repaying in fiat, their returns may be less than what you would have gotten for your BTC.

It's not a flat fee.  Interchange fees are a percentage of sale.  It's likely that Circle is not doing a cash advance, but something closer to a regular transaction.
If you bring your Visa debit card to my store and buy something, I'll pay about 1% in merchant fees if you pay with debit (using PIN), or 2% if we ring it under "credit" (visa probably takes your money next day).  These are fees that I pay as the store owner, your bank doesn't charge you anything.  As a store owner, I eat those costs, but in the case of Circle, they are passing the cost on to you. (maybe squeezing some profit in there - I don't know what their rates are)
Websites typically pay north of 2% because online transactions carry higher risk profiles than brick and mortar.

Just in case anyone is confused, the cost of sending via Bitcoin was not significantly cheaper because OP was forced to use localbitcoins to initially acquire the BTC.  If sending from USA, China, or EU and sourcing from a proper exchange / broker, the cost would have been much lower.
This post is more about how the UK is behind in market depth / accessibility, and less about Rebit.ph.

I heard it secondhand, but did watch the action on Bitcoinwisdom as it happened.  I think most of it went down in a Bitcoin chatroom on TradingView.com

Consumer adoption is going to be very tough, because most of the fees charged to merchants are passed through to consumers already with cash back rewards etc...  Also, many consumers rely on credit and like to build credit history.
If Bitcoin has a killer application, it's probably privacy.  Even for those of us don't so much as jaywalk when it comes to following the rules, privacy can still be important.  Ultimately the privacy issue will probably turn into a high-stakes game with the government, but if we escape without an outright ban, then I think Bitcoin will have a bright future specifically for this purpose.

Indirectly, it's merchants who subsidize those discounts, and they wont go away any time soon.
Bitcoin is an easy sell for merchants because they can save money, but credit card companies and their ilk figured out a long time ago that they have leverage over merchants and can just give all the perks to consumers instead.

The bond doesn't actually cost 100k to acquire, think of it as more like insurance.

Personally, at my brick and mortar store, literally nobody uses it.  Like it's happened 3 times in 6 months and we do 1000+ transactions per day.
We still take it, but it's getting to the point where some of my employees barely know how to work the thing and I start to question if I want to spend my time even showing them.
So that's probably the typical experience in stores that are not web-based.

I'm a merchant who does 1000 transactions per day and allow me to say that 99.9% of my credit card charges go through without incident.  Your 120-day analogy has no relevance in the real world outside of porn sites and other special cases prone to chargeback fraud.
It's true that credit card funds do typically take 1-3 days to show up in my account, depending on the processor.

We knew quite a lot of this already, but point  is the biggest and most significant change from the original proposal and today I believe is the first we've heard of it.
Do take note however that KYC/AML will still have to be performed on the intermediary's own customers.  They simply realized how impossible / unenforceable it would be to track the counterparty.  Coinbase will still be asking you about yourself, but they might stop asking you about where you are sending money to, etc...

Yes I am, but waiting on a sort of "end all" implementation like Zerocash's PCP+CS proof idea described in this [**video.**](  I admit the whole thing goes mostly over my head, but generally speaking if I'm into invest into something and try to build a network effect around it, it needs to be a lasting solution and not an incremental step above current technology already used in Bitcoin mixing.

The main issue you'll run into is that even if you team up with say, Bitpay or Coinbase to facilitate these transfers and automatic fiat conversions, the end result will be a USD balance in their Bitpay or Coinbase account as opposed to their bank account where their business expenses are posting.  They'd still have to go through the normal process of EFT out of Coinbase / Bitpay into their bank account.
If the final need of your client is money in the bank, then there's no way for Bitcoin to bypass transfer mechanisms used by banks.

rebit.ph, by some calculations I did a few months ago they were cheaper than PayPal.
If you're not happy with their services, I believe they have a few other competitors also, google it!

I don't think this company has a large footprint in the US, but it seems to have a big footprint in Europe.  To me it seems similar to Verifone in terms of size and product offerings.
It's probably only for the new terminals, and these things can take years to upgrade, but it's still a big deal.

Better ASICs means a lower cost per hash.  It's entirely possible for hash rate to rise while price drops if there's still legroom in efficiency gains through new technology.  
That said, don't confuse hash rate with network security necessarily.  It's probably cheaper to attack the network now than it has been in a long time, it just takes newer ASICs and a certain budget to do it.  Generally speaking network security will have a pretty solid correlation to market price.  The notable exception is that of course you can no longer use a botnet, or an all-purpose supercomputer, to attack the Bitcoin network, which is great.

The one's you want to add support are companies like Dresser Wayne, they need to add software and firmware support for displaying the codes on screen and integrating that with the POS system inside.
They have very little incentive to do this right now, and their software development tends to move at a snail's pace.  It certainly helps when a major oil company makes a feature request, but those same oil companies tend not to own the stations themselves (franchise model) and so they don't have much incentive.

Bitcoin evades control by authority, but can still be sent instantly over the internet.  This is the primary use case that it does better than anything else, the rest is mostly fluff.
It's for this innovation that Bitcoin is unlikely to die, but at too high of a price it's an expensive network to maintain for a still nascent online black market.
@_date: 2015-01-01 01:19:43
The main issue is that most of their hardware POS systems designed for heavy retail traffic will not support BTC in the software / firmware.  Having to install a separate tablet/terminal to process BTC transactions that isn't integrated with the rest of their accounting will be a tough sell.  Also, volume for BTC transactions off the web is usually pretty low, and profit margins on products sold in malls is usually high enough that they are not sweating the 2% transaction fees for in-person purchases with credit cards.
I don't want to discourage you from supporting Bitcoin but as a retailer myself I think you'll find this to be mostly a waste of your time.  I think you'd be better off hosting educational workshops or something like that, teaching individuals.

But tdlr; the amount of outstanding shorts cut in half, to a fairly low level when expressed in terms of USD.  One can probably safely assume that a solid 80% of shorts got squeezed out and then a few new shorts opened at the peak of the FOMO.

If the product is reliant on 3rd party services they certainly can.  Even so, this is hardly a problem for most people.

If you send PayPal &lt;-&gt; to PayPal it's instant, and you can buy a lot of things from a lot of places using your PayPal balance. 
Eventually these banks and other fiat third parties will facilitate instant transfers with each other, many already do especially in Europe; so it's just a matter of time really.  One could make a fair argument that it'll happen a lot faster than Bitcoin becoming adopted by the masses.
All of that said, speed of transactions isn't what attracts me to Bitcoin anyway.
@_date: 2015-02-06 21:52:35
Fair point I guess, but worth noting that the combined reach of all of Bitcoin is still less than PayPal, and there's always the possibility of companies like PayPal and banks creating a trusted link where instant transfers become possible.  Such a scenario would then create a combined aggregate reach that is greater than Bitcoin would ever achieve.  This would make you point technically true but practically speaking irrelevant.
That said I'm not arguing against Bitcoin by any means, I love cutting out middlemen, just speaking in terms of transaction times.
@_date: 2013-12-28 14:37:49
What he means is taxed at the time of mining, and say the coin is worth $500 when you mine it, but $700 when you convert to fiat, then pay additional capital gains tax on the $200 spread.  If the coins were liquidated at $400 then put $100 on your tax loss and carry it forward.  Ideally you would set this all up as a small business and treat equipment, electricity etc... as expenses so that would also lower your tax burden.
Whether or not this is the correct way of doing it I don't know, but I just wanted to clarify that I don't think he was strictly suggesting double taxation.

Actually, as a retailer this product looks perfect for me.  I would assume the printer is thermal, so no ink required, and paper can be a good thing sometimes to be perfectly honest.  My store will be doing transactions without waiting for confirmation of payment, but the idea that my not-so-tech-savvy manager can confirm payment off paper receipts a bit later is reassuring, cause I don't have the time to babysit every transaction.  Also, we're a truck stop, so speedy service is important.  Being able to hand the customer the receipt with QR code and move on to the next customer while they figure out the scanning etc... will save everyone time.  Lastly, it's an easier sell to the uninitiated than the idea of touching phones or squinting at tablet screens.
For a technocrat something like this might seem dated, but in truth the features of the device are powerful, and the approach makes for a nice bridge between the existing and what might be.

Except they would have to get a ton of merchants to accept bitcoin, which is not easy, and among those who already take it I'm sure they are advertising this fact.
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:05:33
Some customers stay awhile and eat, others leave as quick as they can.  That said, isn't there a way for me to accept payment "on faith" i.e. an unsecured transaction and simply take the risk?
I don't want to let the risk of losing $50 to some douche stop me from serving the other 99.9% of my customers in the best way I can.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:11:07
As a merchant getting ready to start accepting bitcoin, kind of have to agree that I wouldn't do it if it was hard to convert into cash.  I mean already bitcoin is at best a monthly fee and at worst the same fee as a debit card, which is only 1% less than a credit card.  More than anything else it's a novelty at this point from a retailing perspective, unless you're some kind of specialized high margin online store looking to score brownie points with Bitcoin lovers as a marketing tactic.  Simply put, it's already hard to do but I'm into the concept so I'm pushing ahead to help to do my part.  If it was tangibly harder from this point forward though I probably wouldn't bother.
All of that said, more often than not things tend to work themselves out.  I wouldn't bet too heavily against a cool idea nearing critical mass.  History is on the side of the optimists, I feel.

$30 per month with 0% fees sounds very appealing.  Thank you for the link.
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:18:52
I mean the store itself does maybe a million dollars per month in total transactions.  At first Bitcoin is likely to be an extremely small portion of that, unless I can get one of my house accounts to use it for their business.  
However once I get a system in place, I want it to be there for the growth I believe will one day come.  I'm afraid of the Coinbase solution becoming a lot more expensive to me as a merchant after a year or two, but I'm also afraid of not using the most popular solution in the marketplace today and hurting the adoption rate.  
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:18:16
We have strong cell service and also free WiFi at the store.  .15 + 1% is higher than my debit fees but lower than my credit fees.  Paying a fee like that is not ideal but if the phone app is popular then it might speed integration I guess?
What is the promotional period, or rather what is the promotion?
