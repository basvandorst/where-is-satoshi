Can someone post a link to some bitconnect reading?

The fee was 1.22, transfer was 3.90

Relating to 2. So there is effectively no way to deal get all BTC on one key and unless A. I pay numerous transaction fees (based on the number of address I've used) or B. Only do high value transfers to pay lower fees.  
  
I'm more concerned with the most economic way to deal with the fewest keys with this question.

More research is in order. Thanks for the answer!

I did invest a small amount. What I could lose. Given the way this shit is going I thought even a small amount could be worth a lot in the long run. I can afford to risk more than I am. But I don't want to be foolhardy. But I want to be foolhardy.

I just bought my first bitcoin. I spent the whole weekend researching, setting up my computer and getting a wallet up and running. I just put $10 USD into Coinbase, got my bitcoins and transferred them to my software wallet(Bitcoin Core). I did this as a proof of concept for myself and now I have about .0004 BTC in my wallet.  
I have next step questions as follows:  
  
1) Since each address has it's own PK. I need to keep track of each PK for each address(each containing a chuck of BTC?)?  
  
2) If yes to 1: Should I move all received BTC to a new single(or maybe several) address(s) and keep track of the single PK? EX: A main storage address that is new every time I add a significant sum?  
  
3) When moving bitcoin to cold storage. How should I remove it from the computer that received it(simply delete "wallet.dat")?  
    a. Is simply taking my encrypted wallet and moving it to several USBs is the act of "cold storage"?  
    b. Is simply writing down my PK on paper is the act of "Cold Storage"?  
Sorry if these answers could have been found elsewhere. I would really just like to demystify some of the seemingly simple stuff for myself.  
   
Thank you in advance, this sub has already been so helpful to me.
