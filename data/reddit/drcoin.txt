Why would it be useless?
It would still be decentralizes, the control however would be by the creator. It would be transparent, it could be open for everyone. Don´t know why you would say it would be useless.
It would defiantly not represent a decentralized controlled, open source and anonym idea of bitcoin, but not everyone wants it.
IBM want´s to create a IOT, do you really think they are gone create a bussines model, which is fully decentralizes?

Bitcoin is a decentralized it-infastrukture. It is controlled decentralized. Transactions are verifide without trust.
Company Blockchain is a decentralized but regulated it-infastrukture. It is controlled by a third party. Transactions are verifide without trust.
So why wouldent it be benefituall for a company? And yes it would still be decentralized. It just depends on WHAT is decentralized. Transactions would be decentralized, verification would be decentralized, just changes would not be decentralized.

What attack do you mean?

What Part did I get wrong ? :)

So but one thing i can wrap my head around is. What really happens to the transactions? Because not all transactions are included into the blocks. And what happens if a transaction is in one block that gets solved, and then the same transaction is in another block that gets solved later on?
@_date: 2014-09-23 10:48:27
1 block :)
@_date: 2014-12-17 09:20:49
So the transactions are included into the block AFTER the block is solved?

Choosing between Bitcoin being illegal ore regulated, i think regulated is better. Therefore you will have to tax bitcoin IF you use bitcoin in a other way then as a currency. You don't have to pay taxes on the USD. Only if you use it as a instrument of gaining profit. People / Companies that are using bitcoin as a instrument to gain winnings should pay taxes on their winnings.
I do understand that cheap/fast payment can be done far better by a centalized regulated currency. But this is only because we have a lack of investment, where it is needed most --&gt; in evolving the bitcoin protocol!  
Millions of dollars have been spent in order to buy mining rigs. Having a ton of Hash power doesn't increase the security or the performance of the blockchain protocol. The tone of investment only satisfies the miners in gaining more and more bitcoins. If the hash power of the network would be only 10% of what it is today, it still would be as safe as it is today.
What protocol changes to i suggest? Sadly i am not a programmer, and i  only have basic understanding of how the code works. 
But i do thinks it would help if we start thinking about this problem.
Maybe we can change the way the noods are run, and limiting how much hash power can be distributed by one person/company (registered or regulated mining) 
Please do not misunderstand me. I am a bitcoin believer, i just don't like how things are going in terms of Mining companies who's goal it is to gain profit, having such a influence on the protocol and on what changes can be implemented!

The side that would pay ☺

A currency can not prevail  without some sort of regulation, Its just not possible (example is , how do you tax bitcoin. And you have to tax it in some way). 
This regulation does not have to have a negative impact. It can just clearefy how bitcoin is to be treated in the regulated country. 
The idea of a natural curreny? I agree, and i want it to be a natural currency.  But the way things are developing with huge companies mining and having the most control over the network: natural is defenatly sth. els.
And forking it will not stop the influens of the mining pool. Only regulations in the protocoll itself can help us.

Thank you, i like the security aspekt that you pointed out!
I totally agree. Also i belive, that this could take some costs of one company (the it-infastrukture) would be transfered to the network, and if the servers of the main companie have a failure (it crash, power outage etc.) it would not effekt the system :)

Im looking for professional programmers that can help me on a blockchain project. I will not use existing blockchains. That's why its important that the person/company i am seeking is doing this as a profession and not as a hobby.
Later on i will be planning to also connect it to existing blockchains. But i would like to build my own blockchain. I don't plan to copy any existing one. I want to create everything from scratch and change some things. I am not a developer, and I can't go any further into details.
It would be interesting to know, what exactly one needs to create a standalone new blockchain. (In terms of programming)
@_date: 2015-03-30 06:52:33
I Do understand that more details would be nice. But I can't give any. The project is not currency related. I just want to create a blockchain way of transferring assets. And yes I know a lot of companies are doing things in that area but I don't want to use existing blockchains. Later on I belive I could pedge it to bitcoin but for the start I want a standalone blockchain. Some body on reddit has to know what exactly is needed in terms of programming and work power to create a blockchain. so please help :) naming names or giving me links would help a lot !!

Thank you all for the awnsers!

So if you would want to rewright the blocks and transactions of the past, the current difficullty is not important? Just the difficullty in TOTAL of the previus blocks?
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:54:43
So what happens is 99% all miners stop mining , and the difficulty gets adjusted. Then the 99% go back online . Can they re Wright blocks because the difficulty dropped? It's kind of an 51% attac. Just done different ?!
