Not really the same. WhatsApp just has my phone number and some messages where I don't release any sensitive information. That's an amount of privacy that I'm willing to give away for creating a potentially bigger community.

That's still not acceptable for me, I don't want to support a network that profits on advertising, and honestly, I don't care who owns WhatsApp as far as they don't introduce ads in conversations. As far as I know Telegram servers are closed source too, so not fully audited.

In that case I wouldn't be here talking had they discovered something important. I think you're the sheep, your mind is full of fears, get over it.

Now you lost purchasing power AND this discussion.

Anyway, Telegram or TextSecure are nowhere near in terms of usage compared to WhatsApp, that's my only reason to use it.

Being currently in use by about 700 million people? That's the only thing I care at the moment.

Don't want to be targeted by advertisers. On the other side, I miss p2p encryption, but hey, WhatsApp is the most used messaging app.

For me also because most of who I know uses it, so I haven't a better way to communicate with them. I've tried showing people more secure ways but the network effect is just too big for a relatively small number of worried people to fight against it.

Reddit is an exception, it's a huge community from where I can extract a lot of value. WhatsApp is not running on ads, Facebook does, for me is not the same.

There is a lot of controversy about Telegram. You can introduce yourself to it by reading [this]( and then [this](
I'm also excited about TextSecure, but currently people mostly use  WhatsApp for casual messaging.
