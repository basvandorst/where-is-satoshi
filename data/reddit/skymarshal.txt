Actually it would be worse, possibly even destroyed.  The knowledge and experience from 5+ yrs of running Bitcoin in a total adversarial production environment is invaluable to Bitcoin's continued development.
It is a problem that there are so few people in the world with this knowledge, but replacing the few that have it very 2-4-or-6 years would cause far more problems than it solves.

Blockstream is one of the few major companies acting responsibly in attempting to maintain decentralization.  Remember Gavin originally wanted 8*GB* blocks, and all the companies in the ecosystem whose business model depends on low/no fees jumped on that bandwagon.  Now after delaying long enough to get some real research done, we see 4*MB* as the realistic limit.
Thank goodness the Blockstream team and the rest of Core took their time making that decision, or the rest of the ecosystem would have ruined Bitcoin, turned it into just another centralized digital currency.

There's no data b/c it's never happened before.  (and Jtoomin's 23-node simulator is a good start, but not yet large enough to draw reliable inferences about Mainnet.  For example, Bitfury has done internal testing and estimates at least 500 nodes are necessary for a simulator to be useful)
Right now, if it's not axiomatic or formally provable then there's no way to prove the question one way or the other, and the proper decision making strategy becomes one of evaluating the comparative risk of an "Economic/Fee Event" of blocks filling up vs that of a Security Event resulting from fundamental changes to core properties of a complex, non-linear dynamic system.

Another related question - Nick Szabo has been thinking, researching, and writing about digital currency, distributed systems, and smart contracts entirely in the open, completely publicly, on his blog, in public forums, etc for almost two decades before Bitcoin was invented.

No need to convince them, they already know.  In countries whose currencies have collapsed ~4x times in the last ~2 decades, Bitcoin even with all its volatility, is a superior store of value.  Bitcoin doesn't depend on the stability of any one govt, but on the Internet itself, which so far is proving to more reliable than all but a few governments in the world, and transferrable and accepted in any country with the Internet, unlike national currencies.
Americans and others from developed economies don't really get this, we've never known true govt instability, and completely take for granted a stable government and predictable currency.  But a large portion of the world's population has never known that luxury and is ripe for better alternatives.
There's a [book worth reading]( that looks at, among other things, how people in WWII preserved their wealth through the collapse of their governments and national currencies, that might shed more light on this.

True in theory, though in practice the intent and incentives for an entire organization like Ghash.io are not necessarily the same as for individuals within that org.  Imagine a rogue employee/engineer at Ghash.io with millions in shorts on Bitfinex, or the Russian mob hacking their way in and pwning Ghash's control systems.  51% alone is a bad thing, regardless of the org's intent and incentives.
The best available solution right now is for everyone to move to P2Pool, which smooths the variance of bitcoin generation while keeping the block verification function decentralized.
@_date: 2014-08-11 03:15:55


Nitpick - price volatility makes it a poor unit of account, but is orthogonal to store of value.  As long as the average value appreciates over time (or does not depreciate) due to a fundamental structural reason, like, say guaranteed scarcity/limited supply vs increasing demand, then it can still serve as a long-term store of value regardless of volatility.

What's ironic is that Ron Paul is absolutely getting his [competing currencies]( wish, just not quite in the form he envisioned, and he's too set in the old definitions of "money" and "intrinsic value" to understand it.
Fundamentally, that which gives a currency intrinsic value is that there is something inherent to it that causes people to want it, aka drives demand for it.  In the case of gold, it's the inherent psychological effect it has on humans which causes us to want it, covet it, whether rationally or irrationally.  In the case of the USD, it's that it's required to pay taxes in the largest economy in the world, or to buy oil from many of the oil sellers.  In the case of Bitcoin, it provides a unique utility in the form of faster, easier, cheaper wealth transfer than any other available system (among others).
It doesn't matter where that demand comes from, as long as it will reliably persist indefinitely.  Gold's psychological effect will last forever, at least until/unless we genetically re-engineer the entire human race.  The USD will remain the required medium of tax remittance in the US for a long time.  And now that Bitcoin has effectively embedded itself into the Internet, it will last as long as the Internet itself does (presumably outlasting individual governments).
Hence Bitcoin's persisting utility creates enduring demand, which gives it intrinsic value.  Its demand relative to its supply creates its price.
But old school guys like Paul (or Krugman on the other side for that matter) just can't seem to wrap their minds around this.

The fundamental problem is that no one understands the full security ramifications of even small block increases yet.  One could liken it to a butterfly flapping its wings and causing a hurricane, except over time rather than space.  Eg, a small blocksize increase now could result in a considerable security problem in 5, 10, 20, etc. years.  
The folks on the conservative, risk-averse side of this debate are taking that long-term view, because they know Bitcoin's true, and only, value is in privacy, censorship-resistance, and decentralization, *not* as a cheap payment network to compete with Visa or Western Union.

If Satoshi reappeared and sided with one or the other, he'd have to justify it with an argument based on the computer science.  Gotta avoid appeal to authority fallacy, even with Satoshi.  
For instance, one problem he'd need to address is that the only known [provably secure model for Bitcoin]( requires full broadcast, meaning every node must connect and broadcast directly to every other node.  That's obviously not the case today even with 1MB block cap, hence trusted stopgap solutions like the Bitcoin Relay Network.  
That's a problem that still needs to get solved or heavily mitigated before Bitcoin can aspire to the same level of trustworthy-ness as current centralized global reserve currencies.  It would be interesting to hear Satoshi's take on that, esp since he disappeared before that paper was published.

All companies in Bitcoin have conflict of interest.  The ones advocating for larger block sizes have business models that benefit from free transactions.  Large miners benefit from large blocks more than small miners do, but both benefit from a tx fee market.  Consumers who want to buy coffee and trinkets with BTC benefit from low/no tx fees.  Long-term buy-and-holders benefit most from decentralization (although that's probably just an interest minus the conflict).  Etc etc.

Frankly it's the other way around.  The community needs to listen to the core group of engineers who have shepherded Bitcoin through 7 years of success in a 100% adversarial production environment, where over $1B USD worth was lost by incompetent/malfeasant 3rd parties but none by Bitcoin itself, all while staying true to its philosophical roots of privacy, censorship-resistance, and decentralization.
When Mike Hearn included a switch in XT that would enable him to unilaterally kick any arbitrary node off the network for any reason, that *should* have resulted in the "community" realizing several things:
1.  Such a switch is a pathological feature that would ultimately culminate in the same centralized trust system as we have today, with armies of lawyers fighting proxy battles for control of that power over a global currency.
2.  That Mike either doesn't realize this and hence doesn't understand the true nature, value and potential of **permissionless** technology, or he is a closet authoritarian trying to either usurp or sabotage the Bitcoin experiment.
3.  That neither he, nor anyone else who threw their support behind it, are the right people to lead this project.
That *should* have been the end of Hearn's popular support, yet the "community" proved itself incapable of understanding the long-range technological, economic, and political implications of that one feature, and hence lost the right to expect the other core developers, who understood it all too well, to listen to them on similar security-related issues as block size.
Decisions have consequences.  "the community" currently banging on for a blocksize increase without understanding the long-range security implications, has **proven** themselves devoid of sound judgement, or of being worth listening to by those who aren't.

I'm a big fan of negative liberty, and agree it's a concept not widely understood anymore.
The problem is, it's not just governments that encroach on citizens' negative liberty, but any kind of power center, *especially* natural monopolies like infrastructure utilities/businesses with massive market power and control of the foundational platforms of society.
There will and should always be a balance of power between governments directly accountable to citizens and other less or unaccountable power centers.  Some *de jure* laws are intended to maintain that balance of power, preventing *de facto* regulations these other power centers are capable, and desirous, of.

Actually it does depend on the speed at which blocks can propagate, and is very much in the realm of scientific truth.  Only ignorance would suggest otherwise.
There is [only one]( known provably secure model for Bitcoin consensus and it requires full broadcast, aka every node communicates directly with every other node in the network.  Bitcoin is already far from the model, hence provably *not* secure.  Larger blocks, slower propagation, etc. take it even further away from that model.

I've been involved since 2011, saw Mt. Gox first hand, and I maintain this *could* be much worse, if a fork happens and BU wins.  That hasn't happened yet so you're technically correct, it's not worse *yet*, and there's no guarantee it will become so, but it is a realistic possibility now.
If Bitcoin does HF and BU wins it's likely Bitcoin's price will collapse (since the majority of mining power will be supporting BU).  BU's price will increase until their major technical failures begin and then their price will collapse too.  Then we'll be left with a huge mess far worse than Mt. Gox - a forked coin with the technically sound protocol successfully socio-economically attacked and the unsound protocol failing for technical reasons.

Bitcoin Core is more equivalent to the Ethereum Foundation than to Ethcore or Geth.  BC and EF are both responsible for guiding the protocol development, and that activity is equally centralized in both both projects.  BC also develops the canonical reference client, whereas EF used to do that but spun it off into a separate group (the golang client).  But Jeff Wilcke, creator and lead dev of the golang client is one of EF's three board members, alongside Vitalik and Ming, so there's still close coordination b/t EF's protocol development activity and its implementation in Ethereum's canonical client.
TLDR - there's no material difference in "development centralization" b/t Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Ethereum is succeeding b/c of good PR, b/c it's easier for them to promise all sorts of features and functionality ("Dapps"), and b/c some of the permissioned chain world is looking at using Ethereum as the baseline tech for their use cases.

Imho Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies are far too early and immature to try to involve the "average Joe's".  Everyone trying to do that is putting the cart before the horse.  Neither the computer science nor the governance of decentralized systems is well understood enough yet, and needs another 5-10yrs before we get there.  Everyone involved now should only be sophisticated, high-information investors/speculators/etc that understand the risks.
And you know what, that's perfectly ok.  All Bitcoin needs to do over those 5-10 years is provide some reasonably secure, globally accessible version of digital gold.  It doesn't need to perform like a racecar or the Visa network, it just needs to remain secure, reliable, and tamper-proof.  There will probably be another GFC, given that the problems that caused the first were never really solved, just shifted from banks to governments.  Bitcoin will be one of the few global safe havens then, and that's what we're protecting by going slow and not screwing it up.

Conspiracy theorists like accusing Blockstream of blocking a simple blocksize increase b/c that will increase the demand for Sidechains (which Blockstream invented) and Lightning (which they're working on).
What those conspiracy folks conveniently omit is that *all of Blockstream's software Free Software*, and that any other company in the world can use it and build their own stuff with it.  Blockstream has no IP-based competitive moat, their only moat is their ability to attract and retain the rare talent capable of architecting and building this stuff.
So if small blocks do benefit Sidechains and Lightning, technically that benefits the entire ecosystem, not just Blockstream.  Though realistically, how many companies that are capable of taking advantage of that benefit remains to be seen.
@_date: 2016-11-30 20:18:34


This is the fundamental illusion messing up the whole debate, that Segwit is more complex than a blocksize increase.  On the surface maybe, but amortized over years or decades a blocksize increase is less well understood (or understandable) as to its effects on the most critical variable, security via decentralization.  Segwit is actually the less risky of the two.


Blockstream didn't author the LN paper, the Lightning Labs founders did.  Two different teams and companies.
Though yes, LL, Blockstream, Bitfury and one or two others appear to be leading candidates for custom integration services, but depends 100% on their ability to retain talent, not on control of any IP, which is as it should be.  In other words, there's no competitive moat for Blockstream except their ability to hire and retain talent.  And that's a conscious choice on their part, fwiw.  The conspiracy theories about them tend to conveniently ignore that little inconvenient fact.

Part of the problem is that the low hanging fruit has been done, and continued development on Bitcoin is getting increasingly technically sophisticated and difficult to understand.  Increasing the blocksize is a lot easier to understand than SegWit and Lightning, and the potential decentralization consequences of increased blocksize are not immediate and thus easier to write off.  Thus it's easier to justify to oneself kicking the can down the road on an existential issue like centralization (just like traditional politicians do with, say national debt and entitlements), especially when juxtaposed against a more immediate "crisis" of full blocks and fee markets, whether real or imagined.  You can see how non-technical business-oriented folks may then gravitate toward increasing the blocksize.

The ones that get it wrong attempting to satisfy short-term business expediency needs will collapse and fail, while the ones that get it right will endure and become the global decentralized currency/ies of record.  There's probably room at the top for 1-3 major global cryptocurrencies, all the rest will be relegated to small niche players or mere curiosities.  Which future do you want for Bitcoin?

That's not "subsidizing", that's paying a fair fee for services rendered (securing the network).  Subsidies are granted by a third party to either a producer or consumer to achieve an economic end that the producer and consumer together are not willing/capable of.  In this case, the consumers of transaction security and token value are paying a fair fee to the producers of those goods for supplying it.

Hate to break it to you but Bitcoin *can't* remain P2P money in its original form.

That was Bitfinex, not the actual Bitcoin blockchain/protocol itself.
Also, centralized 3rd party services are easier to implement than things like decentralized exchanges, derivatives, prediction markets, etc.  The ecosystem built the former first simply b/c they're easier, and lucrative when there are no other options.  But all the latter are coming, slowly but surely (Lightning enables at least the first two).

Yeah, there's a huge hype cycle going on since ~2012/2013.  There's an unhealthy combination of rightfully-hopeful but technically-uninformed ideology and get-rich-quick speculation happening in parallel that together put the hype cycle into a positive feedback loop, but it's gotten out ahead of the technological realities and now we're in a painful process of readjusting expectations to the reality.
It's not just with Bitcoin, it's with all crypto.  First it was Bitcoin-to-the-moon, then it was Ethereum-to-the-moon (which has even bigger technical hurdles than Bitcoin), next looks to be ICO's-to-the-moon, etc. until they run out of things to hype.  It honestly looks a lot like the speculative bubbles Wall St likes to blow.  But there will probably be a retrenchment similar to the early 2000s Dot-com crash, then after that will come the real success stories, the Google's of the crypto world that actually provide real value.  Imho the game for Bitcoin is to do the hard infrastructure building work now to position itself as the most robust, reliable platform of choice then.

Not exactly.  First, Digix's gold is physical gold, not digital gold.  Only the title to it is digital.  With Digix you can transfer title to physical gold sitting in some safe somewhere, but the gold stays in that safe.  Whoever controls the safe ultimately controls the gold.
With Bitcoin, whoever controls the private key controls the bitcoin, and that private key can be transferred globally for a few cents.  The equivalent would be Digix FedEx'ing bars of gold to your house or other storage *you* control, and that is considerably more expensive than sending Bitcoin around the world.

@_date: 2016-12-03 19:07:39
Exactly, b/c there's demand for it, same as anything else.  But there's a lot of rigid thinking on what is "allowed" to cause people to hold a currency in demand, especially among gold bugs.  But all that's really required is for that demand to be durable and stable across generations of people and governments, and there are multiple different ways that can and has been achieved.  Gold is the most durable, especially across coups and different regimes and whatnot, but if your government is relatively stable and long-lasting, like the US govt, then other means of durable, stable demand become possible.

Negative ghostrider.  All those 10's of cryptos will run into the same scaling problem as Bitcoin.  Bitcoin's best play is to solve that problem more robustly and reliably than all the others, so as to stand the test of time while all the others fail.
There's an ancient Japanese proverb - if you wait patiently by the river long enough, you'll see the body of your enemy floating by.  What it means is, sometimes doing nothing is the winning strategy, let your enemies make all the mistakes and self-destruct.  That's Bitcoin.

Not a good idea to implement hard fork code that doesn't take effect for a long time.  The devs and community will learn a great deal during that time and it's very possible they would come to a different decision.  In critical decisions like this, best to delay action as long as possible so as to gather as much information for the decision as possible.


You don't want to do any last minute rush jobs at any stage, but the decision to put a hard fork switch into production code should be delayed as long as possible so as to gather as much information as possible.  Like seeing how Segwit and Lightning affect the network.

Hard to say, multiple roughly equally viable options.  Ideally you want to learn compsci fundamentals so that you can then recognize how they're implemented in different languages just in different syntax, making it easier to learn any language.  Kind of like how learning Latin first makes it easier to learn any Romance language.
But that takes a lot of time and is super hard to do mid-career, and may be something to instead do in parallel as you ramp up learning a single language.  C++, Java, Go, Python, Javascript, Swift, and Objective C are all common Bitcoin application development languages right now.  Your best bet may be to pick an open source project you really like, see what language it's in, learn that, and start contributing to that project as early as you possibly can.  Becoming a regular contributor to a FOSS project used by many companies is one of the best ways to get "discovered" and get a job in the software industry.  You'll necessarily need to start simple, maybe adding more tests and helping debug/test it first, before graduating to adding features, etc.

Segwit *reduces* complexity and attack surface by eliminating tx malleability, reducing scaling of sighash ops from quadratic to linear, explicitly hashing the input value, upgrading from HASH160 to SHA256 for P2SH, adding script versions, and reducing UTXO set size growth.

1.  Nobody really knows what "reasonable" is.  All transaction history is stored on every full node in the network, and as it grows it becomes more expensive/burdensome to run full nodes, hence there are fewer and fewer.  But we don't know what growth rate is safe and what is dangerous.  For example, it's possible the majority of Bitcoin full nodes already consist of blockchain data analysis companies' research/monitoring nodes rather than actual users.  
2.  A hard fork may or may not be necessary for Bitcoin, but 1) we want to squeeze as many things as possible into it and only do it once, and 2) it's too early for that right now, need more time to develop the stuff that goes into the HF (like Schnorr signatures, if they can't be SF'd in).


Not stupidly, this is Core being fair to the whole community, and ensuring that if SegWit gets activated it is not contentious.  Yes it does expose SegWit activation to the tyranny of the minority, but Core judged it more important to set the bar high enough to ensure almost no contention to this change.  If it doesn't get activated, it doesn't get activated.

It's an interesting question for sure.  Currency can derive its value from both scarcity and utility, and historically most currencies have had a combination of both.  In antiquity, gold coins, one of the best examples of deriving value from scarcity, also derived value from their utility - small, easy to transport, universally accepted medium of exchange across cultures and jurisdictions (because humans are genetically programmed to covet lustrous shiny things, so that source of demand will never fade).
In modernity, the US Dollar on the other hand has no scarcity, but still derives value from its utility.  It is required to purchase US TBills which are still considered a major global safe haven asset in turbulent times, required to buy oil in many places, required to invest in any US market (capital, real estate, etc), and required by 300M+ people to pay taxes and buy everyday goods.  No scarcity, but utility.
Like gold coins, Bitcoin derives its value from both too.  But unlike gold coins, Bitcoin is just software which could theoretically be changed, for example to add some inflation to it as this paper anticipates may be necessary.  Big question is, would its utility compensate enough for the decrease in scarcity for it to remain valuable?

This is critical.  If you closely examine most big block arguments, they break down into fundamentally either a circular argument, appeal to emotion, or short-term business expediency with no regard for risk (eg, same mindset that brought us the GFC).
The exact effect that block size has on level of decentralization and other system characteristics is a fundamental uncertainty, meaning that no amount of logical reasoning or empirical research can prove one course or the other correct.  Thus in the face of that intractable uncertainty, Core's conservative roadmap is optimal.  Baby steps - do everything you can to improve scaling *without a hardfork* first, then sit back, observe, evaluate a year or three, and figure out the next step based on what you learned.
If, after all that, a consensus emerges that everything has been tried and a blocksize increase HF is still needed, then that is a more substantial position than trying to force a HF at present.

Not sure why you're asking me for a source, the burden of proof is on you.  I've explained the simplest possible outcome of Segwit2x adoption, and you're asserting that a more complicated outcome is more likely.  Why?
To reiterate, Core will likely refuse to merge Segwit2x b/c thus far they've publicly said they don't like it.  This will lead to all of the hash rate and users who want to Segwit2x to switch to btc1 instead.
If that happens, and if the switching hash rate and users make up an economic majority, then Bitcoin will effectively become the btc1 version.  After that, the most likely outcome is that those users simply stay on btc1, and don't switch back even if Core eventually bows to the pressure and integrates Segwit2x into their client.  Why would they switch, no point.  It would take extra work for them to then switch back to Core, and presumably anyone who switches to btc1 doesn't even like Core in the first place.
So, why do you think anyone who switches to btc1 would actually switch back to Core after that?
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:34:28
Yes, and the way that happens is that the majority of the hash rate and user base has to stop running canonical bitcoind and switch over to btc1's client, effectively making the btc1 team the new Core.  The old Core can continue developing their version in the hopes the btc1 team will integrate their work into the btc1 client, but btc1 does not have to do that.

Very good reminder.  A similar shakeout will probably happen around 2019 after all the ICO's from this year run out of money, and after industry has spent 2017 and 2018 discovering blockchain isn't a panacea.
Hopefull won't be as bad as the dotcom crash though, just b/c far less money has been invested into it.

* Fragile:  vulnerable to breakage due to stress (disorder, unexpected events, or more formally, of variance and pertebations)
* Robust:  resistant to breakage due to stress
* Antifragile:  gets stronger when stressed
Until he coined the term "antifragile", there was no antonym in the English language for "fragile".  Robust/resilient/resistant are not true antonyms, so he needed a new term to express something that gains and grows stronger from disorder, rather than breaks under or is merely resistant to it.  
The book is a catalogue of examples demonstrating this, and the main thesis is that in a world where extreme events are increasingly common yet no less unpredictable (from contagions to rogue waves, etc), systems and infrastructure should be designed to be antifragile.  This almost always necessitates rethinking them from first principles.

This isn't about the [canonical bitcoin]( client getting an occasional patch from the [btc1]( client, it's about btc1 becoming the canonical bitcoin, and maybe sometimes optionally taking patches from the former canonical bitcoin.  Big difference.

We've been so conditioned, especially by things like the Lean Startup Methodology, to always be doing something, trying something, throwing it against the wall and seeing if it sticks, pivoting when it doesn't, etc.
But that methodology may be inappropriate for global mission-critical infrastructure like Bitcoin.  Sometimes no decision is better than any decision, the status quo better than a potential mistake.  Core appreciates this, but few others do, and this is one subtext of the scaling debate.
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:00:17
Yes but the point is, they won't go back.  They'll stay with btc1 and its team.  That's the whole point of btc1 and the NYA.

Actually yes, I've always been of the mind that small blockers should be advocating for *even smaller* nodes, if only as a rhetorical device to more strongly illustrate their concerns.

Sensitive dependence on initial conditions.  Look it up.  
Not all can see right now how wise Core's prudence on blocksize is, but one day it will be obvious in retrospect.
@_date: 2017-07-03 06:29:01
Take your head out of the sand.  There's a big difference between  being the canonical Bitcoin and  being the canonical client.  Such a transition would effectively "fire" the former, thus firing core.

If that were to happen, and there was no continued development coming from btc1, then yes everyone would eventually switch back.  I doubt btc1 will cease development though.  We shall see.

There are three common methods used discredit someone in politics or business:
* sex scandals
* financial improprieties
* mental disorders
Savvy people should immediately recognize when any of these are being deployed, either directly or via implication, and turn their skepticism first *on the accuser*, at least until burden of proof has been satisfied.
I'm pro-Core, but seeing Core-aligned folks stoop to this tactic is disconcerting.  Keep to the high-road, folks, that's how you win in the end.

And then possibly collapse under its own weight (or become a centralized database).  Ethereum may demonstrate to all who don't grok it yet why big blocks are problematic as blockchains try to scale to more than a few million users.

Yes.  They conceive, architect, implement, and test most of the upgrades that get added to bitcoin (I say most b/c sometimes folks not considered part of Core also conceive upgrades, but Core does most of the grunt work of evaluation, testing, and implementation).


Yes. (miners and full nodes secure the actual network, but of course that depends on how the protocol actually works, and absence of flaws)


Add new features (SegWit, Schnorr, Confidential Transactions, etc).  Fix bugs.  Find and fix security problems.  Lots and lots and lots of compsci research.

The protocol is the blueprint, the network is the house.  Design vs implementation of the design.
PS - one clarification.  The core development team known as "Bitcoin Core" is responsible for the [original Bitcoin client]( but there are other Bitcoin clients with their own core dev teams (btcd, bcoin, etc) too.  But when you hear Bitcoin Core, or just Core (capitalized), it's always referring to [these folks](

This is the key point.  Bitcoin has an opportunity to do one thing really well, to absolutely own a niche, and Paypal 2.0 is not it (though it may be for Lightning, we'll see).  Being an alternative global reserve currency/asset is what Bitcoin is most technologically congruent with.  It is secure and reliable, geographically distributed, capable of moving value globally even if expensive.  You don't expect to move gold around the world cheaply, but that's the price you pay for the ultimate store of value/safe haven.  Fitting the tech to the use case/problem is important, and this is the best fitting use case for Bitcoin.  Attempts to make protocol modifications that are not congruent with its fundamental nature, like expanding the blocksize to make it into Paypal 2.0, risk breaking it *for all use cases*.
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:48:03
Ethereum's technical challenges are even greater than Bitcoin's.  Ethereum supporters' faith in Vitalik has thus far forestalled similar levels of consternation and angst as seen in the Bitcoin community, but I expect at some point that may become more of a thing as the nature of the challenges surfaces more.
@_date: 2017-07-03 21:04:17
So the plan is that btc1 implements SegWit + 2x blocksize,  the economic majority switches to btc1 and hard forks the network, then Core concedes and integrates btc1's changes into their client, and everyone switches back to Core's client?
What I'm missing is, what's the incentive for that last step, everyone switching back to Core's client?
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:01:27


This is the key statement.  Bitcoin needs ASAP SegWit, Schnorr, MAST and whatever else is needed in the base layer to enable all possible innovations in the higher layers.  Once that happens, then the difficulty in changing the base layer becomes an asset, but till then its a problem.

Any ICO that:
1.  is based on the [ERC20]( token standard (a copy-pasta app-coin hosted on Ethereum),
2.  which issued its token before the actual platform launched,
3.  and whose token is trading on exchanges before the actual platform launched.
Which is almost all of them.
ICO's are trying to make the argument that their token is not a security but more like a [paid API key]( that is required to access the functionality of the platform.  But when they can issue a token and have it trading on exchanges *before* there's even a platform for it to grant access to, then regulators are likely to consider it an unregistered security.
There are a handful of ICO's that intentionally did not use ERC20, where they won't issue a token until the platform actually launches, and the token is their own blockchain's native coin, not an app coin based in Ethereum.  They also made it clear in their prospectus that they were running a crowdsale similar to Kickstarter, and that they guarantee nothing in return.  Not sure how regulators will view those, but they're less at risk than the ERC20 ones.

Fwiw, you may be able to drop Windows entirely.  I've been Windows-free since 2007, pure Linux (Ubuntu).  The only remaining issue is sometimes needing MS Word for when people send you .docx files, but I just ask them to save it as a .rtf or .pdf instead and resend.
Worth a try at least.  It is sooooo much nicer being on an OS that was designed from scratch for hosting multiple, mutually untrusting users.  The security framework that prevents them from getting access to each others' files and the system files also helps prevent outside attackers from doing the same thing.
Windows has been playing catchup on that front for a long time.  Amazing how much the Unix folks got right back in the 60s.
