I’m sorry, but I would be so irritated if I got this as a service worker. There is no way the dollar tip you left them is worth the trouble of figuring out how to convert it to real money.  This is a dick move.

This is no different than locking the money in a Rubik’s cube, giving it to the employee and saying ”lol goodluck bro” 
@_date: 2019-03-23 00:49:20
Can the employee pay his rent or taxes with bitcoin? No they can’t

..this is good for bitcoin? How to use bitcoin with no electricity/internet?
@_date: 2019-03-22 23:48:47
If I worked long hours in shitty job the last thing I would wanna do is go home and figure out how to redeem my tip money that is probably desperately needed for rent/food. Don’t be a dick to less fortunate people and just give them cash. 
The tip as a gesture is great. But this is not an appropriate time to shill crypto
@_date: 2019-03-06 04:47:20
Wrong. Capital loss is realized when the asset is SOLD.  OP did not sell his BTC he gave it to a Nigerian prince. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 21:19:20
I think the best part about this is that it can’t even be considered a capital loss since you gave your shit away. No tax write offs for you.
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:43:42
So I’m not supposed to spend it? Why is it called a currency? Isn’t the whole point of a block chain a de-centralized ledger to track payments?
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:27:26
If people are using Apple credit cards wouldn’t that mean less people are using bitcoin as a currency? 
@_date: 2019-03-05 21:15:12
lol the scammer lives in China. The $14,000 lost is a drop in the bucket compared to the fees of an international attorney.

lmao. “I lost a lot of money buying bitcoin cash. Hmm... but with regular bitcoin I would have lost a little less money... that must be the better option!!”
Great logic. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 04:03:23
This is hilarious. All you crypto kids have been going on and on all year “just HODL, institutional money is coming”. Well it finally has, just not in the way you were hoping for. Now you’re all butt hurt about it. 
@_date: 2019-02-26 12:27:35
Walk up to him and laugh in his face for using major credit cards. Tell that soy boy that crypto is the only acceptable currency. And if he’s a true believer he will ONLY accept crypto. We need to spread adoption!!

So if bitcoin is Netscape, won’t it become worthless when the crypto equivalent of chrome comes out?
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:35:44
After 10 years bitcoin has not been able to find a use case that can disrupt any existing industries. Price speculation is the ONLY thing propping it up.

Go door to door and ask whoever is home if they have heard of our lord and savior satoshi nakamoto. Do not leave until they agree to watch a PowerPoint presentation on how blockchain works. Don’t leave until they agree to setup a mining rig in their basement.

@_date: 2019-04-12 23:01:47
How many people use Netscape today?
@_date: 2019-04-13 01:38:36
Bitcoin is the first iteration on the use of blockchain technology. Same as Netscape was an early web browser to the internet. It died when something better came along. Blockchain as a technology has a future. Not bitcoin itself
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:34:15
People like OP make bitcoin sound like a cult. And the kool aid results in financial suicide
@_date: 2019-04-11 23:24:32
[this dude bought a ring for his fiancé.](  and all the comments are calling him an idiot, that he should have held, calling her a shitty investment should have kept the bitcoin.

...But how many are bots?
@_date: 2019-04-11 07:56:57
First of all, it’s transactions. Second, 95% of that is just bots trading with each other
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:13:14
Your doing it wrong. According to this sub your supposed to HODL till you die
@_date: 2019-04-12 22:28:14
There’s gotta be room for improvement... during the peak of the 2017 craze bitcoins transactions times took hours and the fees were super high. Surely a better coin will come around to fix those issues
@_date: 2019-04-28 01:29:57
Why are you idiots happy about this? They charge a 4% fee not including the spread... that’s outrageous. 
This is targeted towards suckers who dont know any better.

@_date: 2019-04-04 22:49:27
Bitcoin has people brainwashed. The “don’t worry about price just HODL” mentality is on the same level as Christians demonizing science to stop people from learning any better
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:28:03

@_date: 2018-11-24 22:43:45
If that’s the case then why is no one flocking to buttcoin right now as the stock market tanks? Wouldn’t this be prime conditions for crypto to flourish?

Your mom accepts bitcoin?

I thought BTC was supposed to replace fiat. why are you still measuring its success to the dollar?
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:13:32
r/personalfinance hates risk. If you make any suggestion on how to make some real money they downvote you. I once asked them for advice on what I should do with a large sum of money I had sitting around. Most replies advised I put it in a CD. I looked up how much a 1 year return would get me and it was 1.5%... are you fucking kidding me? I said fuck that I picked my own stocks, found a high risk/high return mutual fund, learned about bitcoin bought a few and now I’m up 18% in 3 months.

So in which chapter does satoshi get crucified and die for our wallets. And does vitalik gather 2 of each alt coin aboard is ark before the bear market flood arrives?

lol, not only did you yolo invest everything into crypto, you put it into shit coins. And rather than cut your losses at something reasonable like -10% you waited till -97% to admit defeat. Your parents must be proud
