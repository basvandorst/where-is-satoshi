Well, I got their first reply, and have responded (not with these words, mind).
    In periods of heavy traffic, there may be a delay in receiving the SMS. Please allow for up to five minutes to receive the SMS.
Done that, no luck.
    Please ensure that the country code you selected for the mobile phone is the country in which the mobile phone is registered, and not the current country you are in.
    When entering your phone number, do not include the country code. Once you have registered, and selected the country of your mobile phone, the country code will be added automatically.
    Please do not add a zero at the beginning of your phone number, and please do not add spaces
I can't actually enter my number when trying to withdraw BTC, because the use my filed number for that. The one I entered when registering, and worked then. I don't understand why it doesn't work now.
Guess I'll be waiting a bit longer.

I'm pretty sure I tried both with and without country code when trying to enable 2-factor (the only situation where I can manually enter a phone number now).

Thanks, but one of the problems is that I can't change the number associated with my account. Maybe if their support will do that for me.

I sent BTC and did some trading with the intent of getting slightly more BTC back :)
