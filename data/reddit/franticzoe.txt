Both sides seem like dickheads to me. Kind of like US politics.

That's not true, instant 24/7 clearing is a thing now and slowly being adopted across the payments industry.

I think plenty of people would like a way to pay online without handing over their name, address and credit card numbers. Like buy a $100 bitcoin scratch card at the corner store and charge your bitcoin account, then spend from there, sort of like how people use a prepaid credit card (only better).

Sort of. They have a clear pro-Israel bias, and this has been confirmed by independent investigations. The bias is expressed mostly in the news they don't report, i.e. Palestinian casualties and oppression, settlement building, etc. Of course, the Israel lobby attacks their 'anti-Israel bias' but they do that to everybody.
Other than that, they are firmly anchored in the establishment and the general media industry (just look at the people in the governing bodies) and report pretty much what you would expect from them and relatively neutral across the political spectrum.

LOL, I see what you did there.

I like that I have no idea which side either of you are on.

You forgot to mention Hitler. Anyway, it doesn't have to be between "pleasing everyone" and civil war. Aloofness from the core developers in the face of real concerns in the community is making this situation worse. All they need to do is communicate on the level. At this point it is starting to look like passive aggression against everyone who have doubts or questions about the direction.

This is an attack? All I see is carefully worded constructive criticism. With skin so thin no wonder tensions run high.
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:31:05
If there's one thing I can speak to it is that one side seems to be slinging mud and the other not so much.

I hope these are two-way ATMs, since I imagine the number of Greeks wanting to *send* money out of the country (or anywhere) is probably a rather small group compared to people who would like to *receive* money (via bitcoin or otherwise).


If you can't buy or sell stuff with it directly I don't see how it is a solution to "day to day" problems.


If you (a) have money to invest, and (b) think bitcoin is as good as gold. Both seem unlikely to be true for a very large group of greeks right now.


Three hundred inquiries for a thousand ATMs planned? And again I can't really see why a shop would want one, except for the same reason some shops are also a Western Union, which is a pretty small subset of shops in any given place. 
What shops in Greece should have is a machine that also functions as a POS terminal, so people could easily buy stuff directly with the bitcoin relatives send them from abroad. That would be extremely cool.

That's because the sandwich shop is no longer accepting bitcoin, and neither are any other shops.

But in that case you (or the hub operator) would be breaking the law, right? Seems like a death knell for it to be adopted as a mainstream technology.

The world doesn't evolve by the whole world getting together and sensibly agreeing on a perfect standard or protocol for the next new technology. 
It evolves by someone sitting down and building that new thing. Then, once it becomes clear that this thing is happening, everyone else scrambles to get in on it and build on top of it. See: The world wide web. It's why your user-agent starts with "Mozilla/5.0".

I don't want to type in a 12 digit number, a three digit number, then two more two digit numbers, and my full name, authorizing someone to make a deduction (any deduction!) from my bank account whenever they want. Just for buying a pizza.
With bitcoin I can just scan a QR code on the screen and my pizza is paid for. Like cash, but more convenient.

WTF, it's only been a couple of months since it was last at 300. Talk about being obsessive.

For institutions who can't invest good and want to learn other stuff good too!

There is a category of things the Chinese government promotes, a category of things they censor, and then a big category of things they don't care much about one way or the other. I would guess Bitcoin falls into the latter at this point in time.

Banks borrow at the federal funds rate (currently 0.25%) or the discount/repo rate (currently around 1%). 
Newly issued fiat enters the system here first, i.e. before their inflationary effect has rippled to the rest of the economy (so $100 are at that point still $100 dollars worth, a short while later they are less worth when all the new money has been spread around).

"Moxy" would also have been accepted.

Whatever is bad for central banks is bad for commercial banks. Why? Because the main source of income for banks is that they borrow from the central bank at a lower rate than everyone else (actually get first dibs on freshly printed money), then turn around and lend it out at a higher rate.

freelancer.com is the scummiest company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Just my two cents, use Google if interested in details from others with similar expereince.
