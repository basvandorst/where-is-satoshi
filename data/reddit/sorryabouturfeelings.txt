He's also spending a lot of money on ads to get people to sign up for his newsletter where he will supposedly tell his subscribers about the alt coins he thinks will explode thousands or tens of thousands of percent. The date is Feb 2nd. Not sure if he's going to be pumping some alt coins or if it's legit.

There's that joke about Bitcoin.

Dad: $14, why do you need $23 for?

You put in $100 last year and made thousands. I put $100 like 2 months ago and made hundreds but I would've made more with Litecoin.

Different exchanges so different set of buyers/sellers. Some use this arbitrage to profit by buying for a lower price on one and immediately selling at a higher price on the other.

Makes sense. Damn, I guess I should've have created so many addresses. 
So if I send everything to 1 address, say on a Nano S, in the future, if I spend from the Nano, will the fees be small or still big since it's an aggregate of many smaller payments?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:44:37
I sent some to an exchange yesterday, expecting for it to take hours. Got it in less than 20 mins which is really fast for BTC. That or the exchange credited my account with their own money while waiting for my funds to be confirmed, I don't know.

@_date: 2017-12-08 02:48:34
You can. What you can do is use Gdax limit order so it's free. Put a limit order to buy at whatever price you think it will go down to so you don't have to sit at the computer all day. 
Lots of people buy and sell the dips and spikes. The fees can add up but with limit orders on Gdax, no fees.
I'd hold at least some in case BTC spikes and doesn't drop back to those levels.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:12:35
I'd wait to see what happens when bitcoin futures begin trading which I think happens within the next 24 hours. Lots of people are saying prices will tank while some are saying it will increase. 
If anything, buy 1/10th of what you were planning to buy now and see which direction prices go when the futures trading starts.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:02:46
Nice analogy. What does 3500 represent? Number of transactions per block? And 10 minutes is how long it takes to fill a block?

BTC can go down but if the alt goes up, then that's still profit, right?

Oh, didn't know that. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:16:48
I didn't realize you can send from more than 1 address. I would've assumed each of those would be a separate transaction.

I think people are being more cautious, waiting to see how BTC prices react to the CME futures trading availability on Monday. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:02:44
I believe Gdax pays for the fees, but not coinbase. Next time, transfer to Gdax first, then to binance. But there is a fee going back to gdax from binance I believe.

It will dip next Thursday.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:53:57
It goes in ranges.. up and down between a price range, then it breaks and goes up and down between a new range. Sometimes, it will drop back down to an old range for a short time then go back up to the next range again. As long as you believe BTC will be more valuable a year from now than it is today, holding and buying more on pull backs should work out well.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:32:05
Wow, congrats. I wish I had that much to invest.

I read they are FDIC insured ($250k like banks I think) but only for the USD you hold there. If you buy coins and leave it there, it's not insured. I could be wrong though.

You do know people get paid for ideas right? Movie ideas, app ideas, book ideas, business ideas... etc.
Say you came up with the idea of Twitter and told someone and they went on to create Twitter and made a fortune. They don't have to give you anything since there wasn't a contract or anything but if they were feeling generous or grateful for the idea, they might compensate you.

Look at stocks people day trade. Sometimes, prices just goes up because prices go up. People jump in for fear of missing out and no other reason. Eventually, prices drop to a certain point and resume regular price action until another spike happens due to big buyers or some piece of news.

What are the chances of the nano or trezor not working? USB memory card sticks can sometimes just not work. If this happens, are you screwed?
And what are your thoughts on wallets like Electrum?
I don't have enough to worry so the little that I have is sitting in my Coinbase acct but if BTC keeps going up like this, I guess I'll eventually need to worry.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:36:35
According to this site, the fees vary. Is this due to the sender increasing the fee amount for faster confirmations?
Actually, after changing the input to 20k, I see some transactions were only charged like $5 for sending several thousands of dollars. I guess they got lucky?

It's probably due to a cookie on your browser that is showing his ads. 
I looked into it. It's $49/year for a subscription to his monthly newsletter which has articles on various topics as well as a stock he recommends buying and holding long term. There is also a "crypto" section. The main attraction from his ads is him revealing which is the next altcoin that will rival BTC or at least run over 10000% or whatever. The reveal will be before Feb 2, 2018 where he thinks Amazon will announce they will accept cryptos as payment which will cause cryptos to explode.
He was a programmer and said he's looked at the code for the different altcoins and has a list of criteria to determine which altcoins are good and which are scams (says 95% of altcoins are scams). 
Tip: The free bonuses on his sales page, you can google the pdf for those and even find the 6 videos on cryptocurrencies (waste of time unless you're brand new to cryptos).

At all time highs is when people usually predict crashes. No one predicts a downfall when the price is already low.
People have been predicting a crash for the stock market and home prices since 2015 but here we are, still breaking records.

You're on so I assume many will say BTC. Ask this on and they will say LTC. Personally, I'd put it in LTC due to the lower cost.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:34:37
In Gdax, click on "deposit", then "coinbase account". From there you can instantly transfer funds from your Coinbase account into Gdax.
Once that's done, buy using a Limit Order. Just click on "Limit", enter how many BTC you want to buy, then put in a price you want to buy it at. It needs to be less than the current asking price which you can see at the bottom of the red numbers under Order book.
From there, "place order" and wait until your order is filled. 
Same thing for selling, only you'll have to put in a price lower than first row of the green numbers under Order book. 
Oh, and it's **free**, no fees with limit orders. With market orders, "sell/buy right away", the fee is 0.25% or 25 cents for every $100.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:47:22
Depending on what you mean by large amount, put a few coins at different prices rather than all of them at one price. Once you're in cash, start withdrawing. I know GDAX has a daily withdrawal limit so take those limits into consideration. 
I wish to someday have this problem.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:53:01
Create an account on Coinbase (you'll need to upload your id card/license, etc). You can buy there but they charge a 2.99% fee and the price you get is a little bit higher than the current market price. 
If you don't want to pay fees, transfer the money to Gdax.com which is owned by Coinbase. Gdax is an exchange and you can buy bitcoin for free by using a limit order to buy.
It takes a while for your money to be available on Coinbase, over a week sometimes, but once it's in there, transferring it to Gdax should be instant.
With $1k, I wouldn't worry too much about sending your BTC to an offline wallet but it's what's recommended to truly own your coin. Basically, set up a wallet and use the receiving address to send your coin to from your coinbase account. Plenty of guides on how to do that. Although, if you're not going to sell it anytime soon and planning on just holding it for a while, then best to move it offline.
Hope this helps.

@_date: 2017-12-18 05:39:17
The majority of altcoin are scams and won't be around 5 years from today. Many are pump and dumps. So although it's possible for a few other alts to explode to the value of BTC, most will remain at the value of penny stocks.

You really want to win this argument don't you? A homeless person begging for money isn't thinking about giving the opportunity for others to feel generous, they just want money.
The idea I had isn't ground breaking or anything and there likely are already apps out there doing just that but I couldn't find them. The main purpose of my post is for someone to tell me a good app that gives me all of the stores around me that accept BTC and just in case it doesn't exist yet and someone builds an app for it and makes money, why not put the idea out about giving me a piece? 
I know you want to feel special by having posts that have BTC addresses taken down because in your eyes, they're all beggars. My post was taken down so you accomplished your mission. You  must feel good... if that's the case, it was because I gave you the opportunity to feel that way. You're welcome.
@_date: 2018-08-09 06:54:06

If you sold before the crash, that's a good thing isn't it? The key is to buy back in as the price starts going back up again. As long as you get back in lower than your sell price, you'll be ahead.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:47
People sold and once it fell below 10k, a bunch of limit sells were triggered and it just kept going down until it hit all of the buy orders at 9000 and started going back up. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:31:01
If people were fearful, BTC would be dropping. You should be greedy when it's dropping like crazy not rising like crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:26:10
I'm thinking 8k since there was some good resistance there. BTC blew passed 9k and didn't really test it as support so I think it'll be a tad weak but 8k should be solid. But then again, who knows? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:40:10
For it to double in a month at its current price, no, not realistic unless something huge happens like Amazon or Paypal accepting BTC as payment or something. I'd rather see steady growth. It took nearly 10 years to get to 10k. Getting to 20k one year from now will be tough let alone 1 month from now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:10:30
Coinbase is FDIC insured so money wise, you should be fine. Just use another exchange. Now if they take everyone's money as well, riot.

If BTC hits 100k by June 2018, I'll eat right nut.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:01:46
If all at once, it would tank BTC prices but unless there's some fundamental change in how people view BTC, people will buy it back up. So we'll go from 1 guy with 1 million bitcoins to those million coins spread out across a bunch of people.
If he were smart, and I'm sure he is, he'd sell them slowly in order to get better prices.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:05:45
The higher it goes, the harder it will be for some people to invest since many still believe you have to buy 1 bitcoin, like you have to buy 1 share of stock.
Wow, bitcoin hit $10k, but I don't have $10k lying around. Besides, I read that it's a bubbling tulip or something so, no thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:50:58
i think they charge 0.25%, not 100% sure though
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:53:14
Hopefully, 10k will be a strong enough support so even if it does correct, it won't go below 10k. If it does, I expect it to drop to 7-8k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:22
Going to 8k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:27:25
What's your reasoning?
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:12:24
I'd be more interested in knowing when/if $10,000 will become a price BTC will never fall under.

Gotta use limit orders, those are free. If you buy using market orders, there's a fee.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:19:00
Gdax is owned by Coinbase which is FDIC insured, so yes.
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:35:11
Should've bought when it dipped to 5500. It'll likely dip, when and by how much, I don't know. Maybe buy $500 worth now and wait for the dip to buy more.

They're too busy enjoying their yacht to be answering questions on Reddit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:17:50
So you're saying BTC will reach $200k? Thanks for the tip. I'll be sure to sell at $200k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:08:41
If it'll help you sleep better, sell enough to get your initial investment back. Let the rest ride. So even if BTC goes to zero, you'll just be back to before you invested in BTC, minus opportunity cost, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:50:12
holy shit, 50k in 2 days... sucks that it dumped. Didn't know ether ever went that high. I thought 350ish was the highest.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:01:20
You can also use GDAX.com which is owned by Coinbase and buy on their exchange for free by setting a buy limit order rather than a market order. It does take some time to get your deposit through though, like a week.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:31:03
It's right about support level right now. 6000 is the next support, followed by about 5700. So far, it's holding it's current support so hopefully it will bounce from here.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:10:54
You don't know what will happen tomorrow or the days leading up to the split. BCH might be rising faster than BTC now but that doesn't mean that will still be the case a week from now. Fast increases are usually followed by fast pull backs. What if you switch right before BCH pulls back and right after BTC surges a bit faster?
You could always do that with a small amount and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:29:11
Wait for a pull back. We just passed the 9k mark and already at 9400. We'll be at 10k soon or near it but I expect a drop once that happens. 10k is pretty significant.
However, no one knows what the price will do for certain so I advise taking half of what you planned on putting into BTC and buying now. The other half, buy when it dips or even after it breaks 10k. I think if/when it breaks 10k on strength, it will pick up speed but like I said, it will likely pull back before doing that.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:01:16
Most people here would probably tell you to just hold. 
If you want to sell, I say sell shortly after the next hard fork which is on the 16th. The BCH and the BTG fork both caused BTC to dip. If the same thing happens, which it most likely will, you can sell right after the fork happens so you can have some BTG, then wait for the price to come down somewhere below your initial buy price and buy back in.
I bought on the dip last week after the fork when BTC was at around 5600. No idea how much it will dip this time but if you can get in lower than your initial price, it might be worth the trouble of selling and buying back in.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:19:08
In that case, that was the smart thing to do. Sure, you missed out on a lot of gains but had BTC ended up crashing, you'd still owe your uncle $5k right now. Putting borrowed money into a highly volatile investment probably isn't the best idea.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:21
People going nuts in the live chat.

@_date: 2017-11-29 09:47:23
Assuming you bought at $10,000, you put in $100. I wouldn't really worry about wallets for now. Read up about it in your spare time, no need to rush.

I guess I'm confused about the private key part. So once a BTC is sent from one person to another or to an exchange, then you lose the ability to claim the BCH since you don't own the private key anymore?
I guess a more basic question is, does each bitcoin have it's own private key? Or can one person have tons of bitcoin under just 1 private key? If the latter, then if I sent like $100 worth of bitcoin to an exchange but still have more bitcoin in my wallet that I have the private keys to, then I can claim the BCH still but the $100 worth that I sent to the exchange, I can't?
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:04:40
Wait, it did? I thought that doesn't happen until the 25th or something.
