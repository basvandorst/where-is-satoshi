Where can I find company transaction data with Bitcoin? Having a hard time finding companies that releases this information. 
And I can only speak for myself I own Bitcoin as an investment I am happy for my investment when merchants accept Bitcoin as a payment but it doesn't mean I will buy something just because I can use Bitcoin to do it. However, if they have nice things I am interested in I would buy.
Bitcoin doesn't neccesarily make your products more attractive and you still need to reach the Bitcoin user base with your products which is difficult. And I guess it is better to spend marketing efforts at broader audience and unless you sell some "natural Bitcoin" product finding a Bitcoiner among them is like a needle in a haystack.

Great so you found the answer to your question - it was right there in the article. Glad you read it.

The IRS are getting those records.
What you are suggesting is counter-productive to what you want to achieve. 
So you want less government interference in Bitcoin. Then comply, let them see there is nothing here and implement easier ways for users to comply and have companies follow them. Some *criminals* will go down in the process.
The other option is to fight. A fight Bitcoin users will lose.
"Government can't shut down Bitcoin". Users and companies can be shut down. Legitimate trade can be made impossible. Bitcoin is great but let's not live in the world of make-believe we all have a country we are citizens of.
Bitcoiners defend Ross Ulbricht (a drug dealer) and now they rush to defend tax evaders. That undermines privacy. Gov makes the public believe that privacy means crime, and what do privacy advocates do? Begin to defend criminals in the name of privacy.

No but I dont care about its existing state its silly when we could learn so much more to our benefit by changing attitude towards opposing views

Bitcoiners only attacking Circle. Lets lose more businesses and never hear them out eventually they won't even bother to let us know why. Very constructive.

Do you always ask people questions and before they can answer add your convictions to the question? 
Then I think you can stop asking people questions since the "discussion" is a waste of time for both.

I get that Coinbase has a reputation to live up to and defend this.
But it is better to comply now. The IRS are getting those records, the only thing you can do is soften the blow. This should be the priority, not listening to those who want you to 'stick it to the man'. 
Encryption is closed, Gov is open, when the two meet they clash and it just drives them further a part. As this carries on at some point Bitcoiners will view state as totalitarian and state view Bitcoiners are anarchists (unless we find middle-ground). And if we don't find middle-ground, they will become that to one another.
This may become the truth as this is just the beginning of government interference with Bitcoin. Think about how the Bitcoin ecosystem looks like when this scenario becomes the truth. State will have surveillance in place and vanilla users &amp; companies will no longer have a place here.
You can't win this. You will lose either way but you can chose to lose small or lose big. 
The answer seems simple at first but think deeply about this as your actions as a company in a micro situation can hurt the macro of which you are a major player.

I found this submission very intriguing. 
I am very interested in finding out about how much Bitcoin is used for goods and services and so on. 
It is a shame that the larger Bitcoin companies do not publish statements on this as it is important economic research into this new payment system.
I don't understand why people don't discuss these things instead of attacking the author. He raises some valid questions some which can't be answered right now, but still some legitimate questions. 
Sme things are a bit ridiculous but if he's wrong there is no issue with that.

People are not using Bitcoin in your store, but they do use it in some other stores. This post won't solve that bottom line. 
Figure where it went wrong on your end and if the effort to do so is too great then drop Bitcoin as a payment alternative. The alternative is of course to keep it as a payment option and hope.
The customer is always right!

Say I helped the sick and poor. Is my opinion valid now?

I'm sick of Bitcoiners blaming every company or person that leaves. Core developers can do no wrong &amp; Bitcoin is perfect. Bitcoin price is up so all criticism is invalid.
I can't say Core developers have done shit for me since last year or so.  And I'm not grateful to them just because someone else is paying them I think they are doing a terrible job. 
Bitcoin development funding is broken it belongs any corporation or investor willing to put in the most money. They don't even need to own Bitcoin. 
Anyway.. I will wish them Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.. but these worshipping posts are ridiculous.
Realize Bitcoin have problems and solve them instead of attacking everyone who encounters them and speaks up.

Gox had similar arbitrage possibilities. I doubt this arbitrage is a good deal long term but I don't know Indias economy only that their government is coming down on it because a very small percentage (1%~ last I checked) is paying taxes
