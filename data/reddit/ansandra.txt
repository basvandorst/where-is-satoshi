A bit of background on what a future's contract is, from your answer I'm not sure you fully understand the financial instrument that's going to be released on Monday.(Maybe i've just misunderstood what you've typed though).
Back in the day farmers would plant and harvest things like corn and sell it on the market. The problem being that the market price for corn would always change, and a farmer can't 'plan' his buisness if he doesn't know what the price for the corn he just planted now is going to fetch in 6 months when they're harvested.
Enter the "Futures" contract.
Basically the farmer makes a deal with someone. I will give you 10,000 corn in 6 months, and you will pay me 10k for it, regardless what the price is in 6 months.
That's the futures contract. Now the farmer doesn't need to worry about the price fluctuation of corn because he's guaranteed 10k for it.
The trader that bought the contract though can make or lose money. IF the price of corn goes through the roof, the farmer is still  bound to sell him the corn for 10k, and he can turn around and sell that on the open market for 20k and make 10k profit.
If the price of corn tanks though, he is STILL required to pay 10k, to the farmer for the corn, even though on the real market the price of that corn is now only 5k.
This works fine for Corn who's price changes 5 maybe 10% over 6 months.
But BTC's price went up over 500% in the last 6 months, and fluctuated 20% in the last 24 hours.
Everything about the 'future's contract' pricing is MULTIPLIED. If something small happens in the bitocoin community, the price effect on the future's contract will be what people expect that small change to amount to in 6 months, which could be MASSIVE.
Expect this contract to fluctuate between 1k, and 60k. Possibly within a 24 hour period.
Good luck everyone.

The scary thing about futures is it's a contract trying to predict what the price will be in 6 months time.
6 months ago bitcoins price was 2-3k. It's now at 13k.
The price fluctuates almost 20% in 5 minutes. 
Who the flying fuck KNOWS what the price would be in 6 months.
It can be anywhere between 80k a coin and 1k a coin.
