The tricky bit is, opening a payment channel with a node is quite different from picking a Bitcoin node to peer with. It's one thing for a client to offer up a list of good initial peers, but we wouldn't want everybody's first channel to be with the same node.

This would have been back around 2010. I can't remember which list it was (or even with 100% certainty that it was him) but it was a demonstration of using a script to pull a user's public Bitcoin address from their FOAF profile and use that to pay them a tip. The idea was that we'd all have our address stored in RDF and you could get the payment address using Webfinger.
I am unable to find the particular email (for some reason gmail is only showing back to 2011) My first transaction was 2010-07-29, so it was probably a day or two before that if anyone is up to do some sleuthing.
Edit: 
Edit 2: it was this thread specifically. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:25:29
You technically still have it until that transaction is mined as part of a block. The mempool has been inching down, so depending on how low the fee actually was, it's possible it might get picked up soon.

There is a cost to connecting 2 nodes together. The funds involved in that channel have to be locked into a contract laying down the rules that both sides have agreed to use. Forging that contract requires a transaction. This is a significant cost (like 2 sat/byte expensive!) So, opening that channel is like hooking an ethernet cable between the two hosts. Of course, since this is over the internet, the physical distance between each of the nodes makes no difference.
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:42:08
I think I have a goal for the day. I've been running testnet nodes so I could play with LN, but I have been meaning to sync up a mainnet node so that I am ready for when LN is good to go with mainnet peers.

Even if you could see and record the Alice's capacity went down by 10 Ksat to Bob and increased by the same amount to Carol, that doesn't really tell you much. Alice processed a payment for someone and probably took a sat or two for her time, but you don't know who that was or why. This will get even harder to track once money starts flowing around the network for things that aren't even a real transaction. (did someone pay someone else or are they just re-balancing their channels)
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:47:32
The good thing is, with lightning it is dead simple to shuffle funds between your various wallets. It would be easy enough to keep only a couple hundred Ksat or so in your browser wallet and move for funds only when you need to.

This is a graph of the pending transactions that are pending by how much of a fee they're paying. See how it drops down regularly? That's when a block is mined. You want to find your transaction somewhere within the range of what that drop cuts into. Preferably the very bottom layer for the best savings, but if you are in a hurry, go a little higher. Just don't try to get your transaction on top. Unless you're Andreas and you're trying to move out a multi-million dollar tip into cold store, you probably don't have any reason to pay that much.

I mean, sure, they can and probably will move out their non-segwit coins first, but if they're only using segwit addresses by default, sooner or later they're going to run out of coins that are not stored in a segwit wallet. After that point, all their sends will be segwit sends.

I'm right there in the same boat as you. I found it hard to justify spending a bunch of money to secure what was not worth all that much more than the cost of the wallet. After talking it out with a few other Bitcoiners, I've settled on the ColdCard as the best and safest one. I wanted a wallet that was as independent from any external service as possible and that was the one that best checked that box. I only care about Bitcoin, so the ability to store other coins didn't factor in it for me.
Now I'm just waiting for it to ship.

This is one of the reason I don't think Bitcoin will ever kill the banks. Banks do provide some useful services and the secure (and insured) storage of your wealth will still be one of them.

I really hope we see a reliable service that can average data from the major bitcoin exchanges over say a 3-day period (I assume in the future there will be more) and give an easy to read multiplier for sites that want to offer payment via bitcoin, but only want to have to set their price once in USD. That way, the operators wouldn't charge $30 for a bag of skittles.
I would, of course, recommend putting in guards against letting the price fluctuate too much.

Difficulty changes aren't instant. If you could knock a bunch of miners offline then even though it's still going to take a long time to find a hash you have less competition. Might buy you a few extra minutes to get it.

Simple answer is instead of sending out a transaction for every person that needs to be paid, services are waiting a short period of time and batching all their pending transactions together into 1 big transaction. This cuts down on some of the waste and leaves more room for everyone else.

The value still fluctuates, but if you look over the past few days or so, it has been a lot flatter than it was a couple weeks ago. This is a good thing for the market. All the people that were considering accepting bitcoin for their goods/services and those that were considering buying goods/services with bitcoin will be more likely to if they aren't worried about the value swinging dramatically.
Case in point. I bought a lan server / bittorrent downloader from btcdeals. It was listed for 3.5 BTC. At the time it was about $10/btc so I figured it was a decent deal. By the time I got to work the next day, the price was up to $13, then $20, then $26, then $30. Suddenly I was paying a crapload for this dinky little device that I only bought because I feel that the only way to legitimize bitcoin is to patronize legitimate merchants.
Thankfully the guy realized how much I was getting ripped off an gave me a bit of a refund, but in order for us all to not want to hoard our bitcoins all the time, we have to have faith that by the time we make our purchase, get paid, move that money to a market and buy back our bitcoins the price won't have moved too far.
tl;dr - consistent prices == more bitcoin shopping

Part of the data you're hashing includes the address of who is going to get the money. When you're hashing for deepbit, you are including their address and just have to trust that they'll turn around and pay you a bit when they get paid.
If you found a hash for deepbit and then tried to swap out their address with your own you would change that hash and it would no longer be a winning hash.

I'm on Linux, so I use Transmission, but I really only bought it because it seemed like a cool toy and I wanted to support the Bitcoin community.
I bought it when the price was $10. By the next morning it had shot up to $13 and rising. The owner sent me an email and apologized for the delay and gave me a bit of a refund. I was happy, but then I had to wait for the dumb thing to actually ship.
Since then, I try to hit his site every day to see what he's got. I finally found some things I wanted: A remote control for my XBMC setup, and a USB video capture card. That was a month ago.
Last week, I put in an a message to find the statuses of my orders. He responded on monday saying he was looking into all the questions and would get back to us. (we were all BCCed)

The reason for using a payment service is that they can offer payment authorization outside of the normal bitcoin system. If I keep my money in one of these "banks" and you use the same service or a service that has some sort of agreement with mine, then our services can confirm that I have the money and that I have told my service that a certain amount is going to be sent to your service.
This will be the only way POS bitcoin transactions are going to be able to work. If I pull up to the gas pump and want to get some gas, I'm not willing to wait the ~1 hour before that transaction is fully confirmed.
P2P transactions will never go away, but I predict that most of the transactions in the future bitcoin economy will use layers built on top of that system.
@_date: 2011-05-16 03:29:35
I really wish people would get off this whole "you can use bitcoins to buy drugs. OMG!!!" kick. Bitcoin is a currency. You can buy drugs in any currency.

I like to believe that people that are just finding out about Bitcoin now are still early adopters. It may feel like you missed out on opportunities because the BTC is no longer under a dollar and you can't CPU mine for a month and get a hash, but there is still a lot more room for growth.
I was reading an article where they mentioned 1 BTC going for over $500 in some ideal distant future. If that ever happens, getting in at $15-$30 a piece was great.
Bitcoin is a little different than the penny stocks that this video addresses because the rise and fall of bitcoins doesn't represent a company but a whole currency. (The video even mentioned that a pump and dump doesn't always mean the death of that stock)
@_date: 2011-06-28 00:09:03
I really hope it doesn't come soon. I think if anything, these recent "crashes" have made people weary of too large of a growth. While we all may feel that bitcoin is/will be worth $30 again, the market just isn't ready for it yet.
I would rather see a strong push towards keeping the value constant and then introduce a slow steady increase. All an overnight $2 raise is going to do for us is cause another "crash"
