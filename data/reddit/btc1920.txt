Spend more time with friends and family and generally be more relaxed about making more money. I suppose it brings piece of mind.
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:46:27
I will try to follow up yes.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:45:48
Why, thank you for your concern. I have already diversified my portfolio, and have saught expert advice. No need to worry.
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:05:26
I was down in total between 5 and 10. Betting in BTC is dangerous, especially when you bought your coins cheap. Please don't consider me as an example. Just play for fun, because realistically you can never make a profit. Not that I wouldn't want you to win of course.
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:41:16
For the small the chance that it would lead to a result like this. Usually it was to round off the number of BTC in my wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:27:43
I am checking that with a financial advisor. As I understand the law here, you cannot be taxed on winnings in a game of chance. But you can be taxed on exchanging the money.
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:20:58
I was thinking the same thing, so I already cashed out a chunk on Friday (at its top).
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:41:53
I admit, I don't know anything about gambling. I believe in beginner's luck and like to remain a beginner forever.
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:48:53
No I am not. I am in one of the highest taxed countries in the world. At least we have affordable health care. But nobody likes taxes of course.
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:08:39
Ah too bad, it seems you prefer Litecoins :)
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:19:07
I would not know how to prove that without giving up my anonymity... Gotta leave something for the conspiracy theorists I guess.
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:17:34
No Sir! I first considered to leave an amount on a wallet to play with. But in the end, the house always wins. So I am not betting anymore now. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:53:19
Man, this BTC thing sure is expensive...
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:14:56
It would be cool to say that I won with 1 bet only. This winning bet was one of 30. I bet 10x 0.01, then 10x 0.02 and then 10x 0.03.
The whole truth is that I was down about 5 or 10 BTC in total (combination of different wallets). I wasn't betting what I couldn't afford to lose, since the house always wins. Except this time :)
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:22:52
Thanks! To be clear, that's what I was down in total since when I started with Bitcoins. It's not that I was down that amount on 1 day.
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:47:33
What's the point in building a bot, besides the fun of programming it? The more you bet, the more you lose. Why automate that and lose more, faster? Not to say that they don't exist, but I don't see the point.
@_date: 2013-04-19 15:22:57
I still have a fair amount yes. But then we crashed hard...
Now it's up again and I'm selling and buying again.
I also bought 6 Avalons which should pay for my house I hope :)
Thanks for popping in. Last one that popped in begged me for BTC :)
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:44:30
You always hear the stories about the luck ones (mea culpa). Reading this makes me worry a bit about you. I hope you're not in too deep yet.
@_date: 2013-03-29 06:23:21
23.34 to be exact
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:53:33
This is a temporary account to remain somewhat anonymous. I will tip with my main Reddit account.
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:51:21
My wife would kill me if I squandered it. I've been thinking about what good I can do. First thing I thought of was feeding the homeless, but I want to do something longer lasting.
@_date: 2013-03-24 00:16:31
VirtEx is a good investment. Well played
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:04:26
That's a good question. There are some boring things to do, like pay part of the mortgage. Then I will spread the money over different investments with Bitcoin being the main one, as that was what I was investing in initially.
Since it is already all invested in Bitcoin, I have time to decide. The longer I wait, the more it is worth I hope :)
What I am also planning on doing is to give friends and family some coins to get them started with Bitcoin and spread the word.
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:47:06
I know, the miners actually did something for it :)
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:58:14
They can handle it :)
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:51:59
Well that's embarrassing.. if I'd really be a SD employee, I'd be fired now.
@_date: 2013-03-24 16:22:45
I am indeed putting away at least 100 coins for the kid. College cost isn't that high here, so it can be put to use for other important stuff.
@_date: 2013-03-24 13:18:10
In case you haven't seen this yet: 
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:32:26
Well I actually first found out I won by reading that post on Reddit, because of some lag I only received the response from SD the next day.
It's a bit weird to read about yourself, so I just wanted to reply as soon I thought things through a bit more.
@_date: 2013-04-27 20:17:25
Well at least we're getting updates from his lawyers. I appreciate not being left in the dark, even though it's a very shitty situation.
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:01:18
Thanks! Well I am a parent, so I have to be somewhat responsible. I am glad I sold some yesterday, since the price dropped quite a lot :(
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:38:51
I would hate me too.

I hope you are happy now

I misunderstood then, no offence intended. Best of luck.
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:38:17
I understand the problems with that. That's why I didn't play on SD that much anymore (DiceOnCrack seem to have solved that problem). I hope this problem will be resolved one way or another. Either SD or the software and protocol.
However, I don't think SD will change their model unless it becomes financially interesting to do so.

I understand the ethical concerns, my nephew gambled away a big chunk of what would one day be my inheritance. However, as a libertarian I'd think Ron Paul would let people the choice to gamble or not. As long as you don't damage others, I don't see the harm.
I did send 10 BTC to Sean's outpost, as stated in my post, which should feed 400 people according to his website.
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:50:59
What I did find strange was that there seem to be a lot of wins with 0 as the lucky number. But people want to see patterns everywhere.
