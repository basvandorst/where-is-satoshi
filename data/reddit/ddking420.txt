Apparently not, your post literally proves that. Plus the fact you just say "economics degree" and not AA/BA/Master's/Doctorate, lol, you sound like you're just making shit up now and don't even have a degree at all; thinking that telling us "you have an economics degree" is the most relevant thing to investing in the real world.

OP's post history is literally all about doing acid, and a bunch of weird ass trippy music he listens to, and that's literally all lmao. Something tells me this was one of his trips;

I am already out of my position here but I'll watch the stock in the morning at open for some quick scalps. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:01:56
Just sell then. Why do you need us to reinforce your nervousness, lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:57:32
How is it a get rich quick scheme where there is equities and ETF's that are far more volatile than Bitcoin is lol? You sound like someone who doesn't know anything about the Finance world ( then again most of reddit doesn't either ).

If you want to believe every single thing you read on the internet without doing any due diligence feel free to. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:36:54
Well same happens in reverse, the price raises 3-5% and everyone freaks out. Too many people just see a big number and not the percentage ROI.

The point of this post is? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:48:46
There is way better indicator's to use than the Elliot wave. To each their own though but there's a reason EW is barely used at funds.

The fact that you spend your time "arguing with cryptards" says enough.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:32:58
You've never seen a ticker ? o.o
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:47:59
Obviously it's not a crytpo, why would you even think that it was? They never claim to be a crypto.. They are a legitimate public company that acquired a blockchain company.  
  
This is the company summary of Longfin Corp;  
  


  
So why are you stating the obvious? 
  
 And if you know anything about finance anytime a stock's market cap has seen high increases like this in a short time frame some lawyers try and make some quick bucks on fraud, it happens literally all the time and they almost always lose. 
  
**Lastly, that doesn't even matter. I said this post is for trader's not investor's. Traders like myself are already long out of our position on this trade.**

I'm not misleading anyone. You should never take financial advice from reddit of all places, I'm simply stating to look at the % of your ROI not the number itself.  And the shipping rally in my example is just that, an example. There have been plenty of other sector rally's ie; energy, tech, etc, that have produced similar ROI.
  
And your statistic of 99.99%, talk about misleading people, you literally just made that up. At least my sources are not made up, here you go; [$DRYS chart]( and [tons of articles released about shipping stocks rallying 2,000%+ in a few days](
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:46:05
**[$DRYS literally ran over 2500% in the matter of 2-3 days]( BTC has never ran that much in such little time. You're right about buying and selling at the right time, but my point is there have been many massive gains in the past by regular equities, and people need to look at the % of their ROI on BTC not the big irrelevant number. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:31:47
Maybe, a lot of time's I seen a similar saying thrown around it's people implying a top. I see that's not what you meant though. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:17:01
You're stating the obvious, $DRYS crashed hard. What's your point? My only point was it ran over 2500% in a few days. BTC growing 10% a day is nothing crazy. If you want to look at HEALTY chart's look at Nvidea ticker $NVDA, which on a good day runs 5% and on earnings has gone up 10-15%. BTC is not out performing many equities is my point, and it's unwise to get trigger finger over the big number.   
  
**I told you earlier reddit is not a place for giving financial advice** yet I look at your post history and it's all you've been doing on this subreddit. That speaks volumes to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:18:27
Bruh, I'm in it for the long hall. 10K is nothing TBH. It's taken me a few months to make 300% ROI on BTC and I've traded some mid cap equities for over 1000% during major industry rally's. Bitcoin is a buy and hold for LONG term, you're looking at the big number and not the %. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:03:53
I edit my reply to show you sources, since you can't just google "shipping rally 2016" here you go [articles published about multiple shipping stocks in the sector running 2,000%+ in a few days]( Again, that was just 1 sector rally, these things tend to happen a few times a year in various sectors wether it's , shipping, energy, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:15:57
It's gone up 10% in a day, dude chill, that's not crazy at all lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:09:54
It's really not that crazy, look at how some equities perform. For a quick example, last year the shipping industry was literally making 1,000% gains daily on certain stock.
