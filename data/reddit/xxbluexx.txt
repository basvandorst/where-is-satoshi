Mildly offensive comments or tweets. 
I've been tipping on twitter to appreciate edgy humor

Yeah but a Silk Road user can send things to anyone's address. So just because its going to an address does NOT mean that they participated in the transaction. For example, i could send a kilo of cocaine to my neighbor's address. Does this mean my neighbor bought a kilo of coke off the Silk Road? No.

I think being as anonymous as it is(not requiring personal info), bitcoin prevents tying even the address to the person who purchased the contraband.
If not, i would totally send people i hate mini drug packages then tip off the NSA. That would be a funny prison-sentence prank

Why dont people who view bitcoin as a legitimate currency define the "price" as an exchange rate? Has anyone considered the possibility that the dollar is just doing really well? Gas prices are low, and for the time being the USD is in stable condition. While im no economist, but considering what i said to be true, wouldn't the exchange rate favor the dollar in such a scenario?

Thank you very much for both the tip and the comprehensive advice, I hope to hit the ground running! The ATM is less than a mile from my dorm and I couldn't be more excited~

As a freshman at OSU starting in the fall, im extremely curious about Bitcoin on campus (actually a CSE major hoping to gain an education relevant to Bitcoin) 
This may be more personal than you were hoping, but can you make any recommendations about classes, communities, or simply personal tips as to how you began to get involved in-depth with Bitcoin? I love the technology, but im still looking for the first stepping stone on the path to becoming well versed in it.

It might be hard to donate with such a huge throbbing erection.
(I only donated because of Bitcoin, my support for Rand is separate)

I JUST accepted my admission to OSU not even an hour ago, hoping to major in computer science and minor in business. Excited to see Bitcoin is alive and that opportunities like this exist where I'll be spending the next four years!

This man, though not an authority to submit relentlessly too, is a visionary. Well articulated, logical reasoning. This is why im orienting my future to work on Bitcoin. This is what I see in it.
