Elon Musk also once said that PayPal should be the world's bank by now. Not sure how easy that has been, but going from a 90s internet startup to the world bank is no small feat.

So if the USD was created in its current state in 1971, how much longer do we have?

So if Bitstamp just got hacked, why isn't the price of bitcoin crashing?

Your approach is exactly the type of person who will cripple bitcoin. Careful to work with policy makers to get bitcoin legislated? Are you serious?
Bitcoin subverts the nation state legislation, that is the entire point of his video.
Bitcoin will not even lightly damage the nation state? The reverse is true. The nation state will not be able to make even the slightest dent in bitcoin.
Stop spreading the word that bitcoin needs 'careful policy making'.

What languages are you using and what methods are in place for security?
Looks pretty good though.

Ditto. How could possibly know this as fact?

I cannot foresee a time when there will NOT be a demand for anonymous  exchange. This provides the bitcoin marketplace with a huge incentive to develop a cryptocurrency which will be invisible.
Bitcoin technology will continue to subvert the federal state forces and there isn't a whole lot they can do about it. Technology rains superior over judicial regulation. It's that simple.

Try it again. It worked for me at first, then I got logged out and cannot get back it.
Other people are reporting the same.

Seems to be a DDoS attack on their server:

Good idea!
There have been a couple people in the past who have posted on about this very topic. I also know some people from bitcointalk.org live off bitcoin.
I'll see if I can bring up their profiles and post it back here ... maybe we can get them to chime in.

An interesting perspective on the current debate: NO on BIP101.

This is exactly what bitcoinxt represents.

Makes a compelling case for not separating the coin from the ledger! The coin does NOT exist.
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:48:57
I think we are still just getting started.
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:48:56
Who do you despise most in the bitcoin industry?
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:30:06
Wow, an 80% markdown on price? There is the incentive for mass adoption right there.
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:37:05
Who are your biggest influencers in the bitcoin industry today?

Which other countries frame it as VAT exempt?
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:59:36
I'm sure IBM and banks understand this. The choice to use the term 'blockchain' is likely one for PR and because they do not want to add credibility to bitcoin, which they know will disrupt their business models.
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:06:14
BOOM !! Goes the dynamite.
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:13:42
Not entirely save their national economy, but it could help the few who adopt such a bitcoin-like currency.
@_date: 2015-02-23 18:10:06
Maybe some Greeks can escape their situation by jumping into the bitcoin universe. Not the whole country certainly not though.

The ManBearPig. That is simply beautifully done. Is beautiful the right word?
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:29:05
Yes. There is BitPay integration.
