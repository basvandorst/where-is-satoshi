You could have 6 words that would be very high entropy. But to get this entropy:
1) It would have to be purely randomly chosen.
2) Many (most?) of the words possibly chosen would be very obscure.
3) If it end's up being memorable, it probably suffers from less entropy than it appears at first glance, considering some sophisticated dictionary attacks.

No, workers own their labor, and they exchange it to companies for pay. At any time they can withhold the labor, and at any time the company in response can withhold the pay.
The reason a worker controls their labor is because they own it. They are not "capitalists" - capitalists really stands for people who own capital, in this case, it stands for physical capital. They are workers. The capital they own is called human capital. They sell this human capital as what is called "labor".

Well if private companies saw potential they would have beaten the government to it. Admitting otherwise is to say the government was actually ahead of private companies in terms of vision for the future.

See, no one talks to people that describe themselves as Austrians because anyone who raises concerns about their methodology is called a Keynesian. Much like anyone who questions something about bitcoin online to bitcoin enthusiasts is called a troll. It's an amazing mentality you guys share, I'll give you that.
1) I think it is a bit early to claim bitcoin a "success".
2) It will crash because it won't be able to be used as money and be widely accepted if everyone holds onto it. It will at best be a currency like gold - i.e., not a currency, because it is hoarded, but an asset people hold in an effort to make money by not doing anything but holding onto something. Except adoption drives its value, unlike gold which can actually kind of just be valuable because it's an actual material that can be used for things.

Don't make a system that trends towards monopolies? I don't know, I'm not the one saying you can decentralize a system that becomes more difficult and requires larger fixed costs to entry over time.
If you want to decentralize things, fixed costs have to be low so you don't incentivize centralization.
People used to pan for gold in the American west and made fortunes doing it. The difficulty of extracting gold in the new world grew, and now you can't just open up a mining operation by sticking a sign in the ground with your name on it. You need massive amounts of capital to enter the market. The same will happen with bitcoin. Once again, not my system, and I am not getting paid to improve it, so good luck.

I thought you were being the typical user and were saying unless I was doing something to fix this, I was typing pointlessly and/or am part of the problem. Sorry if that was wrong.
I always say, "Hey, bitcoin isn't going to work because xyz is fucked up," yet I get called a troll and downvoted. I've been bitching about issues forever, and now they're just starting to see how fucked their system is - and they've put off trying to fix the problems by 1) relying on a handful of developers, and 2) continually saying any problems will be "fixed in the future."
Surprise, motherfuckers - the future is now. Are things fixed? If not, why are you trying to make bitcoin adoption such a public event? Why do you want to take your new, glitch-filled project and show it to the world so the world can get a horrible impression? Oh - that's right - it's because the arbitrageurs or short-term traders want to make a quick buck by inflating the price by getting a bunch of new adopters buying high. The same greed gene that is killing your currency because miners won't leave a higher paying pool. When are you going to be able to fix that incentive structure? Sometime "in the future" I assume.
(Not bitching at YOU, just cracking up right now because neckbeards don't understand profit motives and why regulations exist).
Disclaimer: I do not own bitcoin... Because the incentive structure is all fucked. And security is horrible. And I don't trust shady exchanges. And I am fairly certain naturally deflationary currencies are not good for growing economies.

The Austrian school is only tangentially related to actual economics. They're more like "philosophers who don't do math".

Look, in the parts of the world that the bitcoin community ACTUALLY cares about - those that are consumer-based societies with a lot of capital flow - pretty much no one but the biggest users of bitcoin will want to be paid in it. Thus, there isn't going to be much of a push from big companies to pay their employees in bitcoin - it's just going to be added paperwork and liabilities they don't want to have to pay lawyers and developers an arm and a leg to take care of.
From a corporation in the developed world, MAYBE it would make sense to pay your outsources labor in btc... but even then, it's probably an even more significant hassle due to tax laws, or just general liability concerns.
I wouldn't expect major companies to do this. Not much incentive.

Get out of here with this government-sponsored "red scare" fear mongering. What a joke to have someone saying it's government sponsored unions pushing companies around - if you are in control of your labor, you can do whatever you want with it, including creating unions, and if a company wants to, they can terminate their employees for forming a union - case in point, the numerous right-to-work states and companies that have done that to remove a laborer's capacity to bargain appropriately. You actually don't even know what communism is if you call labor unions or striking "communism", lol, but I guess that's the trade mark of having been educated in our illustrious high schools in the US.
This is the type of mentality I see constantly supported which makes me not give a single shit as to whether this country succeeds or fails, you have all collectively lost your god damn minds in the midst of a big tech boom and an extreme widespread ignorance of history, thinking the world is some Ayn Rand novel or some silly crap.

That's exactly what I was trying to figure out.
So he offers a discount to bitcoin users - 10%, nothing to sneeze at.
But he is supposedly getting fraudulent chargebacks - chargebacks whose intent it is to get a product for free.
So his discount won't actually do anything but make him lose money. The people who will defraud him will defraud him, and the people who use bitcoin will give him less money.
Probably won't be in business long with this business model.
EDIT: Unless these chargebacks are actually legitimate chargebacks - in which case he will make one sale in bitcoin (if they use it), they will realize the product sucks, can't get a chargeback, and never buy from him again. This is all kind of lose-lose for his original intent.
@_date: 2014-06-14 17:13:34
But see, here's what I don't understand:
So, let's say ghash is down at 40% now. Every pie chart/graph I have ever seen representing market share of miners has a HUGE chunk (~15-20% maybe?) listed as "unknown". And how does one verify that this "unknown" quantity isn't also controlled by any particular mining pool/entity?
So you have ghash OFFICIALLY at 40%, but POTENTIALLY at 60%, which is obviously large enough to cause a problem. The same goes for any of the groups with a large enough market share of mining operation - if your unknown quantity is 20%, any group with 30% or more listed as their official share potentially has greater than 50% of the entire network's mining operations.
AND, that's not even counting potential collusion between pools/groups. What if the owners/lead developers/whoever are in talks with each other privately?
The whole thing seems like a very half-assed situation, IMO. And the issue has been raised enough times in the past that the answer, "Oh well it's a problem that will be fixed in the future," is no longer sufficient. For all the pushing of this stuff on business entities, it's not even in beta. It's barely even in alpha as far as I would be concerned, were I to be given an opportunity to invest - and I won't, because it's so half-assed in my view.

@_date: 2014-06-14 04:49:00
It's not a dumbfuck move though, it's the rational action an individual actor takes in that situation. It might not be SOCIALLY OPTIMAL, but socially optimal situations don't occur with much frequency unless parties bargain and create a contract.
Since there is no desire for regulating mining behavior, and no parties that can negotiate with each other over terms (no body that represents miners and requires them to be licensed to mine, and no body that represents bitcoin users and can petition the mining group for a contract), you're sort of left with this situation.
Miners for the most part aren't in it for some ideological reason, so they're not concerned about the long run prospects of bitcoin. Plus, if they're only capable of pulling so much capital to invest in equipment, as mining rewards become harder to achieve, they'll drop out, having already made their profit. The only people/groups left after enough time will be those who can handle economies of scale, and that will mean a natural monopoly (and, of course, centralization of mining).

Assuming one can remember the pass phrase, it leads me to conclude it lacks any [reasonable amount of entropy](


Seems like passphrases, especially memorable, human-created ones, are pretty much literally the worst things to put as your final solution to security.
P.S. I don't want your magic internet money.

No, I am not missing that, so quit assuming I am to support your argument.
Anyway, have fun with your distorted view of labor relations, I have no need to continue this weird communism/capitalism fight you are looking for. I never said anything about communism, and you bringing it up needlessly when it doesn't pertain to the discussion at hand tells me enough.
EDIT: The point YOU are missing is laborers can refuse their labor briefly to give them a negotiating stance with the employer. You say


but miss the point that laborers may still wish to work with the employer, but have no bargaining chips besides something such as a strike. In this case, they may strike to signal to the employer that they will pull their labor (and their experience, i.e., human capital) from the situation if their demands are not met. The employer can respond by firing the employees, or ceding to their demands, or offering a counter-proposal for the parties to consider. If they fire the employees, they now have to go through the cost of hiring and training new ones. It may be cheaper for them to cede to demands or offer an alternative, but if these are refused and any demands the laborers want met would be more costly to the employer's enterprise than hiring and training new employees, the employer will fire the striking workers and bring in new labor.

True, private industry never makes errors (see oil spills like Exxon Valdez or BP in the gulf, all the security issues leading to hacking scandals like Target, etc) or acts in a malicious manner for profit (Enron, Wall Street fiascos, Madoff, the guy that owns Business Insider, etc).
This place is a nut house of non-thinking.

Yes, I know. Thanks. The point is, if the BTC you get don't cover the electricity, you close up shop.

Merely harbingers of things to come. Wait til difficulty jumps high enough that centralization is needed to turn a profit.

The government wasn't performing the research and development and saying, "When we are done with this you can use it freely." For all they knew, it was going to remain government and they weren't going to see a bit of the action. So, if they saw the value in it, they would have done it themselves in parallel, like companies do today with products and services in competition with each other.


That's what you did with your networking/IS credentials, so I responded in kind.

It's because most of this is actually just hype and fake accounts trying to drive adoption so the VCs that invest in crypto-tech stuff (like exchanges) can make a fortune before leaving "the space" to those who don't realize it isn't worth shit. They've even perfect call-to-actions by spamming forums, subreddits, etc., with accounts saying, "Let's get xyz-brand to accept bitcoin!"
It's brilliant, but will end in tears. And I will masturbate with those tears, because I enjoy schadenfreude sometimes.

And these all trend towards natural monopolies, so obviously your ~~god~~ ~~prophet~~ ~~savior~~ ~~cult leader~~ original developer Mr. Nakamoto wasn't thinking too clearly when he designed the system to trend towards centralization - assuming he actually wanted it decentralized, of course.

Which won't be at the same price they bought it, and if it's specialized enough, won't fetch anything at all since the target consumer is a crypto-currency miner and the equipment is outdated.

The ability to pay for today's mining is part of the cost/benefit analysis.
Here's how it would work per machine:
Revenue = (Amount of BTC received while reward &gt; cost to run) x (Value of 1 BTC in USD)
Cost = (Cost of miner) + (Cost of electricity to run the miner until not receiving enough BTC to cover costs)
Profit = Revenue - Cost
So it all hinges on what the price of BTC is, as well as the price of electricity. If either changes too much in the wrong direction, it makes more sense to shut off the miners until the situation clears itself.

Yes, the government paid for the internet, in a nutshell. You seem to think ISPs just popped up and made it themselves without the government massively funding its inception.
Interesting. I thought they taught this stuff in schools?
