...open buy at 8... no need to fill. I'm okay if price wants to reach 20k now. ^^

This is me. Thought about buying at 9k but did not really understand bitcoin enough. After reading and learning i finally decided to invest and hodl. Meanwhile price went to ~20k and i was quite happy to get in after a "pullback" to 18k. Wasn't too happy to see the price drop further but thought it doesn't really matter if i am aiming for 100k+ anyway. Bought some more at 14k and if price will drop i will buy some more at 12k and 10k. No heart attack because i can afford to lose it but i dont think we saw the top yet.

Had a buy order at 12200. More funds under way. If price will drop to 9-10k meanwhile i will buy some more. After that i will just hodl because i reached my max risk. Good luck everyone and stay strong! At the end, we will make it!

Read title. Expected the rise of some kind of self-help group. Maybe meeting someone else still hodling since 18k. Got dissapointed badly. :'(

Classic thin Bart pattern right there. It's a bullish sign for sure... until it gets bearish, of course!
