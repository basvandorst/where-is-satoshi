What does the "Error Missing inputs" mean? Can I do something to fix this? (thanks a lot for your effort)

International shipping for 1 magnet is "Small Package International: $3.25" &amp; for 2 magnets "Medium Package International: $15.00"? That doesn't really make sense. From which country do you dispatch?

I am at the exactly same position as you. Waited for 4 hours at the "WAIT_FOR_FUNDING_LOCKED". Then tried closing the channel, but couldn't untick "force close". Now stuck at the "CLOSING (uncooperative)" for another 4 hours. Did you find out any solution?

I opened a connection to a LN channel, with an initially sent of 0.002 BTC. If I need to add some more BTC to the channel, do I need to close the channel &amp; open it again? Is there a way to keep the channel open, and just add some BTC to the channel? Could please someone explain how this works? Thanks in advance
