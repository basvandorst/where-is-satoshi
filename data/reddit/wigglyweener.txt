Dude this is such an incorrect way of looking at things. Go on CoinMarketCap.com and look at the volume graph before the 2017 bull run.  You can't even see the volume it's so insignificant.  Then the bull run happened, and MILLIONS of bitcoin traded hands, a huge portion of which were above the current price, meaning ALL of the coins purchased and held up in that region - and remember, this is an enormous percentage - are now sitting on paper losses.  And to everyone else sitting on paper gains, good ever finding enough buyers to purchase all of those bitcoin at a higher price.  Volume is everything, not just price.  The winners bought on the way up and sold out; the losers bought and held the bags, and dream of someone someday coming along and buying them out of their hole.  It can't happen.  That money is gone forever.  This is the nature of a pyramid scheme.  The early adopters win, and everyone else is just hoping that a bigger sucker than themselves comes along later on.  Eventually the slaughter takes place.

If you haven't figured out yet that Bitcoin is EXACTLY house vs gambler's, you're going to be one of the losers. 
Who do you think the real winners are when a bunch of amateurs start trading a worthless piece of code for money in high volumes? I'll give you a hint: it's the exchanges.

I wouldn't give any credit to the opinions of a company that literally just holds BTC and lets people buy their stock on a public exchange which somehow "represents" the value of the BTC this trust holds.  They have massive incentive for BTC to go up, so no surprise they "believe" trillions of dollars are coming their way.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:45:00
You can't just say everyone who bought outside of that window from 12-20k (going both up and down) are a small percentage of buyers.  Look at the volume during that period, compared to every other period of Bitcoin's existence.  Huge volumes traded hands at those high prices, meaning lots of people have cost bases up above 12k (aka sitting on a loss right now).  Not only that, but even the ones who have paper gains right now don't actually have securable gains - the market is not nearly liquid enough.  There's not that much demand at the current price.  If people tried to cash in their gains right now, or over the next month, or even year, guess what would happen to the price?  Don't mistake market cap for market demand - If I go on coinbase right now and buy a bitcoin for 50 thousand dollars, and in this hypothetical example no other trades occur after I buy my 1 bitcoin for 50k, then the market cap of bitcoin would be ~17 million times $50k, which would sound great on paper.  However, no other fools out there would be willing to by your 500 bitcoin from you at $50k/piece.  It's an exaggerated example, but an important concept to grasp with something like bitcoin.  It's about more than just price - it's about mass sentiment.  Most people holding bitcoin right now will not, and cannot, ever break even.  Their money has gone into the hands of Coinbase, wall street, and guys like me that have realized gains and have sold out.  I'm not giving my money back, and neither are the big investors that already took their gains.  "Hodlers" haven't figured out that their money is already gone for good.

@_date: 2019-07-04 02:26:53
If everyone put their money in Bitcoin and stashed it away as a "store of wealth" and stopped trading it, it would lose value very quickly.  It's price is entirely determined by market demand and mania.  If that goes away, it drops.  Why do you think it was at $3500 a few months ago as the hysteria wore off and people went about their lives?  The bitcoin didn't vanish from existence, but merely the interest in trading it did.
@_date: 2019-07-27 17:07:56
Lol stop using words like "fundamentals" to describe currencies.  No such thing.  This word is used by actual investors to describe companies that you can buy through publicly traded stocks.  Companies have fundamentals, crypto's don't.  It's just a foolish idea to think the coin itself has good "fundamentals".

Eh. It is way more an arbitrary good that people are trying to make money off of.  It's a tiny percentage of people who are enjoying bitcoin for it's "usefulness".  Every single post is about buying and holding, cold storage, taking them off of exchanges, or something of the like.  Buying and holding shows bitcoin is literally the opposite of useful.  It's being used like volatile gold, and we talk about the price of gold per ounce, not the "value" of gold.  At least gold is actually useful in a physical way.  Bitcoin is only useful as a transfer of wealth - potentially - and it's not really being used widely for that.

Yeah, this is exactly why they downvote it. It's no longer a good investment.  You've hit the nail on the head.  Posting bad investment ideas in an investment subreddit will get you downvotes.
Bitcoin has done very well, no doubt.  But it's reached insane levels, and people have become rabidly blind to this fact. I see things where people talk about it going to valuations where it would eclipse the value of all the money in the world by 20 fold, and they think this is realistic.  You can't just invent a currency and increase the purchasing power of the world.  Money is just a concept, and ultimately it has to be tied to reality; the reality where economies still have limitations, and money simply represents what your services are worth in physical goods.
@_date: 2019-07-03 12:30:31
Back in the $1 days, it was mostly miners holding bitcoin.  They at least produced something.  For sure, anyone that's held since those days has done well for themselves, I'm not arguing against that point.  However, I would say we've reached, or are very close to, a level where new investors will get burned and never be made whole.  Right now is the best time to be a guy who mined bitcoin 10 years ago, and the worst time to be the fool buying those bitcoin from the miners.  This market is irrational, driven by an insatiable greed and a promise of getting rich.  Bitcoin cannot even be compared to Tesla stock - buying ownership in a company that generates a tangible and relevant product and sells it for billions of dollars a year is not the same as buying a made-up token that has no value and provides you no ownership of anything.  You might as well trade pink sheet stocks that represent fake companies and claim that the stocks themselves have value, and don't need to be backed by tangible assets or provide you ownership of anything.

Hm. So you think it's within the realm of possibilities that one day bitcoin is worth 2.1 quadrillion dollars? For reference, all of the money in the world (not just physical; all of it) is about 80 Trillion. So we're talking bitcoin increasing the global money supply by about 26-fold.

Sure you have.  1) Paper gains are not gains, and 2) keep doubling down and holding, and I guarantee you won't make money.
@_date: 2019-07-27 15:59:02
Terrible assumption. Absolutely terrible.  Assuming something will go up and holding while your value erodes is not how to invest.  This pipedream eutopia where everyone in the world uses bitcoin instead of traditional currencies is getting exhausting, and it's going to cause a lot of amateurs to lose tons of money.  
If you want to play the momentum like the ones of us who've been around a while, go ahead.  But don't make ridiculous assumptions like "it's going to go up 10x eventually". No one knows that, and you're asking for hurt if you assume it.

This is a great strategy to ensure everyone who 'invests' in bitcoin eventually becomes a bagholder.

Oh I have plenty to play with.  I already have played it.  I watch forums like this to get a good grasp of when a bubble is swelling, and when it's done.  I've been keeping an eye on this subreddit because I would hate to miss out on another foolish FOMO run, but I end up feeling bad for the kids on here that think putting their paychecks into bitcoin and letting it erode away is a wise investment. People can't grasp basic concepts like that Bitcoin is a zero-sum game, and for every winner there's a loser. It's actually worse than that, since exchanges are always taking a cut.  The longer this game goes on, the more money the investors AS A WHOLE lose, and the more the exchanges make.  The ones who lose the most will be the ones that buy the whole time Bitcoin is dropping, and one day it will never come back up.  All those winners will only be winners because of all the bag-holding losers.  Zero-sum.
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:51:10
It's definitely a slightly longer term commitment, but how long does anyone really spend jumping around every year?  Early twenties maybe, but after that I'd say most people can settle for 4-5 years at a time, no problem.  
I didn't even touch on the renting opportunity, but it's another excellent option if you own.  I lived by myself in my first home and rented out my spare bedroom to a friend for more than 50% of my mortgage, who consequently was still living in my house cheaper than he could find any 1-bedroom apartment in the area (I think I charged him $320, but when my mortgage was only $540 this was awesome for both of us).

This is all cult-speak, man. "world’s hardest money ever created", most advanced and powerful money and unit of account ever conceived", "fewer and fewer people will want to exchange their bitcoin".  Bullshit.  You've lost touch with reality.  Do you even understand what money is?  Clearly not, the way you describe bitcoin. You somehow think that this huge class of people (bitcoin investors) will one day own this magic currency that has way more buying power than the currencies that "governments" use.  Money doesn't exist, it's just a conceptual agreement between people that allows us to barter with people other than those that we directly perform work for.  Quality of life exists, technology exists, goods exist, and the only way to earn those things is to produce goods or perform services for other people, and they will give you a token (an I-owe-you), which is money.  You've got to understand these concepts on a global scale, if you're going to claim that it's going to become this huge global currency like gold.  Why would the entire world one day just decide "let's all agree that all of our I-owe-you's are worth 1000x what they used to be.  Let's all buy and sell goods and services in bitcoin, but now we can all afford more things". Here's a question, how many bitcoin per year do you then pay employees when everyone only uses bitcoin to represent your earned wages? How many mid-sized sedans should an employee be able to purchase with a year's salary paid in bitcoin?  See where the problems start stacking up?  This is all because you've forgotten money doesn't exist, and neither does bitcoin.  It's a pipe-dream that the world will one day be better because it exists.  There's no getting around it.

Oh come the fuck on, you cannot POSSIBLY be this stupid.  I want so badly to assume you're playing dumb, but I seriously fear you believe what you're saying.  You think Bitcoin is scarce, and thus supply and demand curves apply because "not everyone can own a full bitcoin guys!!1!!11!!" ?? Don't be a fucking moron.  The concept of a "full" bitcoin is meaningless.  Supply is only limited if there's only enough for a limited number of people to own some.  Tesla Model S's are limited. Living human beings are limited. Bitcoin is, for all practical purposes, infinite.
You might as well be arguing that "there's a finite number of particles in the universe, therefore atoms of Carbon are going to go to $1/piece!! Limited supply!!!" Fucking moronic argument.
@_date: 2019-07-17 20:01:59
I'm guessing you're too young to have ever bought and sold a home, but I'll tell you right now you're just plain wrong on your assessment.  
Let's get the obvious assumption out of the way: everyone wants (needs?) somewhere to live, and if they have any income at all, it will be one of the first things they put money towards.  So now that this point is clear...
Scenario 1) Rent.  Let's say you live in the midwest and can get a two bedroom apartment for $1,000/month.  Good for you, it's costing you $12,000/year, indefinitely, and that money is disposed of, but provides you a basic necessity (shelter).
Scenario 2) Buy a home.  Same part of the country, you can easily get a home the same size or bigger than the $1k/mo apartment, for around $100,000 total.  Let's assume 4% interest, no PMI, taxes of $1200/yr, insurance of $1k/year. Guess what your mortage payment comes out to? $660.75.  Wait how can that be, it's less than the rent?! Yes, it is. Guess what else, you're building equity.  In 5 years, you've spent about $40k total, but you have about $10k in equity that you get back when you sell.  Guess what else? Housing markets tend to appreciate, so you'll probably get more for the home than you paid for it - probably another $10-20k or more.  Guess what else? If you're selling the home you live in, you don't pay capital gains on the profit you make from selling the home (you'll pay gains taxes on Bitcoin, stocks, or just about any and every other investment possible in the US, but not your home).  And as you mentioned, the interest and taxes on the mortgage payments are tax deductions.  You can still take the "standard deduction" if it comes out better for you, but you certainly don't lose that option by owning a home. Oh and if you want to ignore all of those benefits, did I mention your monthly expense is STILL LOWER than renting a similar sized apartment? 
Oh and regarding your example of $24k a year in interest, you'd have to take out about a $600,000 mortgage to hit these kinds of numbers.  Think you're talking to the wrong audience if you think that's an applicable example. 
Don't mislead young people on purpose.  Everyone needs to know these basics - they don't teach them in school, but they're incredibly valuable things to thoroughly understand.  The financial decisions you make while young will be the most important ones of your life, more than likely.
@_date: 2019-07-27 18:32:48
Pretend fundamentals is the right word here, which it's not.  At best, it has a few technically sound features.  Its limitations far outweigh its benefits - transaction speed can never be high enough to make it functional on the scale people dream of. "Lightning" layers and all these other bullshit I.O.U. approaches that don't actually use the blockchain to store transactions completely defeat the purpose of blockchain in the first place, so don't try to justify that as the solution.
Secondly, being technically sound doesn't make it valuable. Lots of things are technically sound, and do not have a use as a globally accepted means of storing and transferring value. Toilet paper has limited supply and is very useful, and everyone needs it.  It's still a shit currency.

Yep.  I have been messing around with bitcoin for years, but the stuff I see on this sub has actually turned me into more of a bear than anything.  I can't help but think, if these are the kinds of people keeping bitcoin alive, it's doomed.  There's no real thought, no understanding of global economics, nothing.  Just "it's scarce so infinite potential" and "deflationary currency so fixes all economic problems" bullshit. I thought I knew what bitcoin was and what it could become, but every time I see someone saying it's going to wipe out the US dollar, I cringe and think a little harder about turning away from it and never looking back.
edit: Kind of like you said, some are here to learn.  I think a lot of my frustration stems from coming here to learn, and instead seeing so much manic pumping that just misleads new investors and encourages recklessness. I learned all too well long ago that the forums where the most pumping is taking place is the place you are most likely to lose all your money.

Hope you have no student debt and own your house outright and buy all your cars in cash, because those are the methods of giving banks money.

It's been a great performer, sure.  That has nothing to do with the future.  10 years is a blip, and it could vanish as quickly as it arrived. I'm not saying it will for sure, but it's crazy dangerous to assume it's just going to keep rising. It was able to rise as it gained recognition in VERY small circles of people, and volumes were insanely low throughout most of those 10 years. At this point the niche discovery phase is over, and everyone has heard of bitcoin. Unless the average person develops a real demand for bitcoin, it's done rising.  By real demand, I don't mean buying on the hopes of getting rich quickly, because that's temporary false demand that disappears when the bubble pops.
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:07:46
All of your logic is correct except for the one, and most important, point. Bitcoin has no backing, and therefore no safety net.  If I invest in a mutual fund, I have enormous diversification backed by the continuing success of the companies whose stocks compile the fund.  If I put my retirement in Bitcoin, what confidence do I have that it will even remain stable, let alone appreciate, over the next 40 years? Why would any rational, wealthy person think that Bitcoin is a better investment than an S&amp;P index fund?  The honest answer is, they wouldn't. No one is going to risk their retirement on Bitcoin - no one wise, anyway.  The 100's of billions of dollars will not flow into it the way people think it will, for this exact reason.  It's got no backing.  Maybe it eventually stabilizes in price and becomes usable as a currency, but that's not the same as growing 8% annually for decades on end like the economy does.
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:30:20

I'm certainly no psychic, and not even that good at trading, but I will say I've been doing it with stocks for years, and I've learned one very important lesson: if everyone is saying something's going to happen and the price is going to shoot up when that thing happens, it's definitely NOT going to happen.  The way markets work, if there's something for sure on the horizon, it's already baked into the price.  I see that mistake made all the time on message boards, particularly among penny-stock type message boards.  People will say "oh this thing happens in January, then the price is going to explode!" It never plays out that way.  The thing happens, and almost always the price sinks as all the hopefuls bail out after they realize no one else cares, and everyone already knew it was coming. 
Is bitcoin different? Kind of, yes.  But human psychology drives price movement, and on a large enough scale, it never really changes.

Lotta emotion in this reply.. If we're being honest, then sure, neither of our opinions affect the massive market that is Bitcoin.  I would, however, advise you that emotion is the enemy of making money in any kind of investing.  Feel free to not engage me in conversation if you don't want to have potentially beneficial discussions though.

That just doesn't make logical sense.  Those internet companies turn a profit with the services they offer.  Netflix generates $15B a year in revenue and is only worth 160 billion on the open market (to Bitcoin's 200+ billion).  You think bitcoin's code is worth more to the general public than the services Netflix offers?  Code is worthless by itself.  It has to provide a tangible benefit to people - one that people are wiling to PAY for. Buying bitcoin is not the same as paying for a useful service.  One day probably soon, people will get bored with bitcoin and stop buying it, and it's value will drift down indefinitely. The code won't be worth anything to anyone, except maybe companies like Facebook who stole the ideas and are finding ways to actually monetize it for themselves (i.e. generate a bunch of Libra coins out of thin air and sell them all to suckers).

The world got fooled by bitcoin once, and retail investors lost.  That's what drove the price to 20k, and there are way more losers left out there than winners.  I've not met one single bitcoin millionaire, but I've met tons of people who bought into the hype and lost hundreds, thousands, or more, all while screaming "HODL!" They're still upside down on their investments at 10k, as well as any fool who bought during the last spike and held after the crash began. Do what you want, but at least don't lie to yourself and think holding during a bear market is wise. 
Everyone loves a convincing get-rich-quick scheme.  MLM's still exist all over the place, in spite of the fact that everyone knows most people are better off avoiding them entirely.  Casinos exist and remain jam-packed with fools.  I'm not saying no one wins, but I am saying the majority loses.  Crypto will be no different.

I've been spreading this same wisdom around the sub - people don't seem to understand that planned future events are already baked into price today.  Such an amateur investing mindset.  If money were that easy to make, we'd all have tons of it. 
People need to think about how irrational it is to imagine a bunch of investors looking at a commodity going "this thing is about to happen! I'll wait until it does and THEN buy a bunch of it!" If it was really good news, then everyone bought the moment the news of the event came out. They don't wait for the event to occur to buy in. Only amateurs (and the uninformed, which is almost worse) do that, and as you say, they end up getting dumped on.
Stated more simply, "buy the rumor, sell the news".
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:52:23

If you can't see that companies are, and have been, duping people like you into buying their chuck-e-cheese tokens with real dollars, then you don't get what's going on. ICO's were nothing but a scam for lots of companies to raise money, most of them weren't even mineable cryptos. Libra is no different. How do you get a Libra in your wallet? You give Facebook the equivalent in dollars for permission to use their Chuck-E-Cheese token in their games.  Backed by governments? Who cares, Facebook already won the moment a single person paid them for their shit coin.
Bitcoin has potential, sure, I see that.  What I don't see is why that has to necessarily involve its market cap reaching into multiple trillions.  It might happen, but then again people are irrational and foolish.  I guarantee you in 10 years, people will look back at the crypto nightmare and wonder how so many people lost so much money.  And you know who the real winners will be (and already are)? Coinbase, Facebook, Wall Street, and anyone who made off with the money that young fools threw at something with no inherent value.

This right here kind of defines why I don't believe in a push to 50k or 100k or anything outlandish.  That kind of bull run requires a LOT of money flowing in from a lot of people.  But everyone who knows about bitcoin thinks it will just go up if they hold and refuse to sell. That's just not how supply and demand works.  No demand, no price increase.  Holding won't make it rise.
@_date: 2019-12-18 02:53:35
Bitcoin literally started at zero, so at $0.01 it was up infinity percent.  I don't consider this a valid metric.  It was also a handful of nerdy miners generating coins on their laptops back then.  Maybe a few hundred people made it big.  It didn't go mainstream until 2017, and since the end of 2017 it's been dropping.  Sure you can say the price is astronomically higher, but for the bulk of investors (look at volume charts), it's been a terrible performer for years now.
@_date: 2019-06-29 04:16:34
I have certainly found that buy and hold does and would have performed better than most of my other trade strategies over the years. What scares me about bitcoin is its current size.  When it was worth a few million total, the buy and hold made the most sense - there was so much upside.  Now that it's worth 200 billion, I have a hard time not thinking it's over-stretched.  The question really becomes, is this digital gold that the world will back for the foreseeable future, or a get-rich-quick trend that will fizzle? Honestly, I just don't know. I tend to think it can't really outpace the market cap of gold, meaning the $1m predictions are a bit outlandish, even for a bubble.  Gold has been implanted in human minds for thousands of years as something with inherent value, whereas most people couldn't explain Bitcoin to a stranger if they spent all night trying. It will make it mass-adoption on the scale of gold long-term a very tough sell (I think).

Really look within yourself and ask, do you really care more about the utility than the price?

Are you really so excited to see it "used", even if its value goes down and stays down forever?  The honest answer is no - not a single person who owns bitcoin truly thinks "I just want it to be used, I don't care if it's worth less than what I invested long-term." Zero people.
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:38:39
Why can't humans stop wanting more and more?  I don't know; why can't we stop masturbating and killing people? Why don't we just stop expecting raises every year, and CEO's can just maintain their level of wealth and stop raising prices on products, and wall-street can just be happy with status quo profit reports? Problem solved, inflation defeated. You have to think in terms of the real world, where ideal isn't an option, and solving something on paper doesn't solve problems that human nature perpetuates. Bitcoin, in absolutely no way, solves any real world economic problems.  The sooner you figure that out, the better off you'll be, because informed people almost always outperform the naive. I'm not saying don't fuck around with Bitcoin, I'm just saying plant your expectations in reality.
@_date: 2019-12-02 23:09:14
Ok yes, that's not what was being discussed.  The context was the discussion of the inflation, and how a low level of inflation is necessary for economic growth.  Mathematically, a consistent rate of inflation means an exponential growth in terms of absolute dollars, but your comment seemed to imply inflation rate itself was going to grow out of control, which it's not really. On your actual point though, it's absurd to pretend that this is some kind of runaway process headed for instability.  It's a stable process that has allowed the economy to function incredibly well for almost a hundred years, in spite of the many experimental political policies over the decades.  Sure, every ~30 years or so the cost of goods doubles, but so does my salary. It makes the numbers keep getting bigger, but who cares? If this is what's required in order to keep the largest and most successful economy in the history of mankind stable, so be it.
Also, if you're so concerned with exponential growth making numbers get out of control, try investing in the stock market.  Average of ~7% growth per year for the last 30 years at least, in spite of a huge recession during that time. Subtract out inflation and you're still crushing it.  I don't see the problem, and neither do any of my investment accounts.
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:25:35
Show me a chart where inflation has been on an exponential rise over the long term (it doesn't exist).
Next, imagine a world where the money supply didn't keep up with, say, the population growth.  People keep being born, but no new money enters cirulation.  (Dollars in existence) / (people in existence) actually decreases.  How then does anyone (or everyone) expect to keep increasing their wealth over time?  What happens is the older, established generations keep increasing their wealth, and there's less and less available to the younger generations.  It's a shit concept, move past it.  Bitcoin doesn't 'fix' this, because it's not a problem.  Bitcoin as you imagine it would itself become an enormous problem for the global economy if all other currencies went away.
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:44:14
This article is 100% correct, like it or not.  "solving a problem that doesn't exist" is the best way I can think of to describe almost any cryptocurrency.  Honestly, do any of you struggle to pay for things in fiat? If you do, you're either young or just plain not willing to put in the effort. Venmo already does exactly what bitcoin hopes to some day be able to, and there are no fees. And I can't accidentally mistype a character address and lose my money forever.  Hmmm...

YOU LITERALLY ASKED. Fucking troll. You don't know how to have a conversation, you can't even remember your own line of thinking long enough to remember what questions I'm answering. 
Bottom line, Bitcoin is done. Everyone knows what it is, no one wants it.  It's a ponzi scheme for lazy people, and the only demand for it is that of people looking to sell it to a greater fool. Read this article.  It might as well be titled "Definition of Bitcoin"

"As soon as the big bad market makers stop manipulating, we'll all be rich." Grow the hell up, this is absolute childish foolishness. It doesn't apply to stocks, and it doesn't apply to bitcoin.  There are no evil giants behind the curtain "manipulating" the price downward. It's just good old fashioned free-market economics.  There's no actual demand for bitcoin, and there are no actual real-world uses for it.  Just a bunch of lazy people trying to get rich quick on something they literally don't understand.

Two years ago today, in fact.  How's the S&amp;P done since then? Point being, diversify. Everyone in here should be very, VERY minimally invested in Bitcoin, if at all. Buy bitcoin after you've invested in mutual funds and 401k's and still have money left over.
@_date: 2019-12-19 22:38:52
I've never said stocks outperformed bitcoin in the last decade.  I agreed it did well.  What I have said is that right now, in this moment, it's a terrible investment. The past doesn't matter.  I can point to dozens of stocks that I think still hold real, intrinsic value and are worth buying.  I cannot say a single good thing about the future of bitcoin. 
As to why I'm here, it's partially habit, as I started as a curious noob like anyone and bought in very early on.  I bought a bunch in February 2017 and sold sometime on the run up later that year, as I knew a bubble when I see one. I missed the peak, but I made several multiples of my money.  Sometimes now and then I trade it when I'm feeling bored.  I come here to feel out the sentiment, but I get so bogged down by the horrible and dangerous advice being spread around and I can't help but speak out against it.  Take the original post we're commenting on for example.  It's utter dog shit.  Some retard drew some lines in paint and now high school kids think "the chart guarantees this thing is going to 100,000!!!11!!1!".  It's foolish, it's dangerous, and it hurts young investors that don't have the money to lose.  I see posts about people investing large portions of their weekly paychecks into bitcoin and I want to smack them in the face.  I can't help it at this point, it's compulsory for me to step in.

Lol at the "find me a company". Off the top of my head, Roku is nearly 7x since late 2017, AMD is 42/share and was ~6/share in mid 2016. Many, many more have done 10 fold or better in the last 5-10 years, and companies you've heard of. Broadcom, Amazon, Nvidia, Netflix, Tesla, take two interactive, and on and on. I could Google more if you'd like. The difference is, as these companies gained recognition and adoption, their values skyrocketed. *Since Bitcoin gained notoriety and recognition, its value has steadily declined*. that should concern the fuck out of you. That's what a bubble is, and that's what it looks like. Ran on hype, slowly deflates over years as people realize it was one gigantic nothing-burger.

Sigh... Copied from my response to another guy on here:
Saying "you don't get it" is not an argument - it's a thinly veiled attempt at appearing to be intelligent beyond the opponent's comprehension, but in actuality it's arrogant patronizing. If you want to tell me I "don't get it", you better back it up with facts and logical, reasonable arguments.
Also, it does not change what money is.  To make that claim is to have no understanding of what money is in the first place. It's a different type of currency, sure, but it does not uproot the concept of money, which has existed among the animal kingdom for all of recorded history.
@_date: 2019-09-06 02:07:24
There's so much to unpack here, but I'm being impatient at the moment, so I'm going to keep it short and address the primary flaw in your thinking.  You're thinking too transiently.  In other words, you're only thinking about the point in time where Bitcoin and dollars exist simultaneously.  The price of Bitcoin may go up because demand for it may grow, but this is ONLY because people are buying Bitcoin with fiat.  What happens in your scenario where Bitcoin becomes the primary currency of the world?  How does Bitcoin continue to increase in value when fiat doesn't exist?  What continues to drive this "deflation" of the currency?  Hint: it's nothing.  The 'investment' nature of it ends when transience ends. It becomes exactly like any other currency, and inflates, because inflation isn't a property of the currency, it's inherent to any economy - it's inherent to human nature.  And it's not "the man" driving it.  It's people like you and me that expect raises every year.  It's companies that want higher profit ever year. It's products going up in price because these two things are built into us.  Bitcoin doesn't undo that in any way, shape or form whatsoever.  
Imagine at this very instant every person's fiat in the world is replaced by bitcoin.  At this very instant and every day moving forward, explain to me why bitcoin prevents our new "money" from inflating.  Don't worry, I'll wait.
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:49:27
I think it's an absurd proposition, by any and every analysis.  Internet revolutionized industries in real, tangible ways. Marketing, advertising, purchasing, services provided, media distribution, you name it.  How would anyone suggest that a payment method is going to "revolutionize" any industry?  No significant industries today are sitting around going "man, what our business really needs is a way for our customers to pay us in a more cryptographic manner".  The truth of it is, people are drinking the Kool-Aid if they think the world is just suffering along, barely getting by having to use fiat, waiting for crypto to save them from their own misery.  It's just blind cultishness to suggest such a thing.
Does Bitcoin have a place in wealth storage and investing? Sure - for now, at least. Everything else is nonsensical hype.

Dude you must be a Trump supporter, the way you spew incoherent bullshit and then parade around like you won.  I'm done trying to explain to a fool how much of a fool he is. It's like trying to explain to a Mormon that they're in a cult. You're in the cult of bitcoin, and you've drank the kool-aid.  Your world where this deflationary currency is the only thing that exists is a fantasy that will never come true, so we might as well be arguing about what the zombie apocalypse will be like. I've ignored most of your poorly hashed out arguments because they're not even worth my time.  You think I'm wrong?  Good luck in life then, because you've got a lot of penny stocks and ponzi schemes in your future. I mean, goddamn, you said things like "money is assigned value by the ruling class" and think you've schooled me in the concept of money.  Turn your brain on for about 30 seconds and you'll figure out how asinine this statement is.  Societies as a collective determine the value of money.  They determine EXACTLY what their goods and services are worth, and what another persons goods and services are worth, and if those goods and services cannot be practically exchanged directly between two parties, they use a mutually agreed upon medium as a placeholder for them to go get different goods and services elsewhere.  The man has nothing to do with this process; it's a natural process that has occurred literally forever wherever bartering was not practical. 
And for the record, you and your whole cult's argument that 'omg it's limited supply, that means its value must keep going up foreverrrrrrr!!1" is the stupidest thing I've encountered in all my life.  If, and by "if" I mean "it literally can never happen", all other forms of currency including precious metals, fiat, sticks, pieces of paper with signatures on them, tulip bulbs, and anything else that could represent the concept of money somehow disappeared off the face of the earth and out of every living human's memory and was never thought up again, then sure, bitcoin would be deflationary as population grew.  But this is SUCH A GODDAMN ABSURD hypothetical that I don't even know why I'm trying to explain such a basic truth to you.

I'm not going to fault you for being idealistic, but you have to keep your expectations inside of the realm of possible.  Let's take it one thing at a time:
"Once we dump the banks" - hold it right there.  This won't happen.  Banks are an unbelievably integral part of this world, and all first-world economies.  You don't just "dump them" because you came up with your own currency.  They provide unbelievably vital services through the lending of money.  What happens to the housing market if banks don't exist? Who can afford a home outright?  What happens to businesses, big and small, if there is no one to borrow capital from when cash flow is negative?  How does an entrepreneur even get the capital to start a small business? Banks.  These aren't things Bitcoin in any way replaces, or was ever intended to.  If you want to say banks might one day lend Bitcoin instead of US dollars.. well at least that's within the realm of possible. 
"we can decrease our work by 50% and still retain level of living" - people have been making this claim since, I don't know, the 1920's?  Again, it's idealistic and I'd love for it to come true, don't paint me as the bad guy here for discrediting this, but it's just not realistic.  You think that Bitcoin is going to dismantle capitalism? You think the ruling class is going to be so confounded by Bitcoin that they forget how to rig the economy to work in their favor?  Keep it realistic. 
"when a parasitic banking class does not exist" - Unless you work for a bank, the banking class is probably not who's paying you a wage that requires you to work more than 20 hours a week.  It's your capitalist boss, who won't be wiped out by the advent of Bitcoin.
Again, I'm not the bad guy here, but I've been investing a long time, and I get the excitement and hype around Bitcoin.  But.. I've seen the same pie-in-the-sky hype a thousand times from people that lose touch with reality, and I try to remind people to invest with a level, rational head.  Bitcoin may go up from here, sure, but don't expect it to revolutionize economies and fix all the things wrong with this world.

And, you know, a legal precedent and guarantee that the USD can be used to pay any and all debts.  And a centuries-old social agreement that it's a valid form of money. But you know, sure, boil that down to fear and hype.

Got any proof? Show me hard evidence that Bitcoin will be around in 10 years.  Hell, give me a compelling argument.  I see absolutely no reason why people won't lose interest and drive the value continuously downward over the next 10 years.  The technology is too good you say?  there's over 2000 cryptos ripping it off currently, along with major banks and tech companies trying to make their own better, more marketable, more profitable versions.  Hate to say it, but Bitcoin has no defense against an onslaught of very powerful, very well-funded competition, assuming the technology is even WORTH ripping off in the first place.

"When the economy reaches these low points, the central bank can exacerbate the situation by not providing enough money. If businesses - such as banks and other financial institutions - are unwilling to provide credit to others, it can result in a credit crunch. This means there is simply not enough money to go around for new investment and new jobs."
From the links I provided you.  Try to think on that for a moment.  Imagine an economy where jobs are scarce but the rich don't care because they're rich.  What incentive do they have to hire your broke ass? Unless there's an increasing money supply, there's no incentive for them to give back.  They're incentivized by capitalistic greed - enough is never enough.  This force actually drives the economy for the betterment of every single young person entering the work force.  If you want Bitcoin to take over the world and inflation and money creation to disappear, you better think about the consequences.  The wealth distribution would tend towards absolute inequality (because remember, inflation is not why the rich get richer), and entire generations would be born and die in utter poverty.  Your Bitcoin utopia can't exist - it doesn't even make sense.  Talk to any economist and you'll see you're naive.

"extreme infancy" at a market cap of 150 BILLION dollars? What is your metric for infancy? What company on earth would you call being in it's "extreme infancy" at 150 billion dollar market cap?  Ford motor company's market cap is 36 billion.  It might be time for a reality check, because your delusional reality where these utterly insanely high valuations are just the beginning is foolish.  And don't you dare say some ignorant crap like "but everyone will eventually own and only want Bitcoin!" because it's a baseless crock of shit.  You know what everyone actually does want and use? Cars.  And Ford still can't justify a fraction of the market cap of bitcoin, because bitcoin is in a hyped up bubble that will not sustain. You're misleading yourself, but much more egregious is that you attempt to mislead others.  Just stop with ignorant statements like this.

And off the deep end he goes... You really won this argument. I can't retaliate against your irrelevant personal insults and your complete lack of refuting any points I made. Pat yourself on the back, kid.

"I could very easily bought at $3000" is the same as saying "I bought at 17,000 in 2017 and I'm still waiting on a recovery".  Good joke though.  If you did buy low, you would have said that instead of "I could have"

In an asset that is only valued based on sentiment, no material change is required to change the value.  Fear and hype are the only metrics that matter.  Nothing else.

"pa[i]d dividen[d] which is the same technically as a price increase"
No.. No it's really as far from "technically the same" as it can get. Dividends are paid to shareholders as an incentive for them to keep investing in a company, similar to how interest is paid on a loan. Price increase of the underlying security or stock, or bitcoin, is NOT AT ALL technically the same as a dividend payment.

Lol you're awfully triggered by a few simple observations.  Sure makes me think I'm right.

Lol, ok. Don't be a fool.

Well your money sure is disappearing fast for something that will "eventually be a multi-trillion dollar market cap" based on exactly no solid evidence or even reasonable speculative theory.

How big of an issue what is? Goods not having 'hard, tangible verifiable value caps'?  In what world is A) this a problem, and B) a problem that Bitcoin, with its ever arbitrary valuation, solves?  
I really shouldn't debate with you, since you in no way refuted any of my first comment.  Saying "you don't get it" is not an argument - it's a thinly veiled attempt at appearing to be intelligent beyond the opponent's comprehension, but in actuality it's arrogant patronizing.  If you want to tell me I "don't get it", you better back it up with facts and logical, reasonable arguments.

I don't know if you are one of those people or not.  Your last paragraph was probably the most level-headed responses I've ever gotten on this subreddit.  I think bitcoin is interesting, and I think there's money to be made, but I feel obligated to discourage the rampant blind optimism on this subreddit.  It's dangerous and misleading, and I try to provide some opposite, if not slightly pessimistic, perspectives.  Caution is important in all financial matters.

Oh yikes dude.  You've fallen victim to the common rhetoric that evil banks print money out of thin air as a way of oppressing the common-folk.  It's a popular narrative these days (since the great recession), but it's not an informed viewpoint.  
" they [banks] create money out of thin air"
No, they don't.  The treasury creates money and provides it to the Federal Reserve, who lends it to banks.  
"FIAT banking is immoral" 
No.. just no. I know we can't all be experts on every topic, and economics are enormously complicated and multidimensional, so I don't fault you for misunderstanding.  However, I'd highly recommend doing some reading on the basics of monetary policy.  In essence, the Federal Reserve attempts to *limit* things like inflation and unemployment through the careful controlling of the money supply.  It's a heavily studied process, and the theories have changed over the last couple hundred years based on the achieved results.  But, the fact is creation of money is an absolute essential part of our economy.  I highly recommend reading through this article:   The concepts surrounding monetary policy are not immoral conspiracies, they are proven facts with decades worth of results to back up the various approaches to curbing unemployment and inflation.  
"Stop mixing in irrelevant concepts like capitalism" - this is like saying let's have a discussion about water but only focus on the properties of hydrogen and ignore oxygen's existence.  You'd be convinced water is highly explosive. You can't just remove variables from an equation to make it simpler to understand.  You end up with the wrong answer when you do this. Capitalism is another piece of the economic puzzle that must be considered when discussing things like the creation of money, inflation, lending, etc..
Bitcoin cannot, and will not, make for a better national or global economy.  It just isn't that simple.  You can't look at one element of the economy (inflation) and say "aha, eliminate that and everything becomes perfect!" The world economy has more dimensions than that.
