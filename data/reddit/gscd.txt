Love this post :-)  I got tired of hearing about all of these charities that waste money and don't do any good.  So I started my own. I basically recycle old useless laptops and stick pdfs (books on health, science, food production, water, etc) and language software (english, french, spanish, mandarin, and arabic) on them.  I then fly them down personally to Lilongwe Malawi, and distribute them to libraries, schools, and orphanages.  This way I can donate and I know my time/money will go towards something benificial.....education (and recycling).  Because cloths, food and bibles are cool, but they will not help in the long run, right?  I am currently in need of around $2000 per trip for the flight down, and I have about 30 laptops ready to go now even, just no money to fly. Anybody have any crypto to spare?  Or any old laptops for that matter (old is fine, as long as they still work tho) I know I am asking for a handout, but in all fairness, I am asking on behalf of african children who don't have any internet access to ask themselves........yet :-)  And if even 100 of you donated just $20 worth of crypto each that would get me down there. Check my website out  pm me too and  I can skype with you too for proof if needed.
