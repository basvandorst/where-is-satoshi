Sure can; I can send an old state to the blockchain.

I don't believe them, and don't trust USDT.

User friendly!

You're trusting the client you ran, and the machine you ran it on.

Sorry, all software can be siliconized.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:16:03
are you sure? did you write your own client?

The signed contract is no good if you can't get it to a courtroom. Settlement is King.

"The mempool is filling" -&gt; I can't settle my channel. Bad money.

No, 1GB is plenty, and you can, by the time everyone uses it. That's a few transactions a day for everyone.

Nope, tungsten (19.3 g/cc) has the same density as gold (19.3 g/cc).

I can run a full node on my laptop at 32 MB, and at 1 GB. Without killing adoption.

Double spending is covered on the first page of the Bitcoin whitepaper - everyone should read it, that includes you.
Lightning isn't settlement, and people can double spend. A full mempool with high fees is mutually exclusive with a functional lightning network.

why would I accept money that could disappear if it can't settle to the blockchain before timing out?
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:08:52
Yeah! And its usefulness as money, those buggers.
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:23:21
Not portable, high fees are on the roadmap. Not durable if sizeable fractions are lost to fees.

Because of double spending; only blockchain settlement prevents double spending. It's covered on the first page of the Bitcoin whitepaper.
If I can't do the payment at all, then why bother? Bad money, no utility.
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:01:27
What if fees are $100, and I want to close a $20 channel?
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:49:40
Money that I can't use on chain, and will time out, is bad money.
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:33:33
Are there any fees that are too high for you?
@_date: 2018-06-27 16:32:22
...but if you can't settle those payments, are they real at all?
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:55:05
Yes, a fee is too high if you don't pay it, and find an alternative to transact. A Ferrari is too expensive if you don't buy it, and buy a cheaper alternative.

The mutually exclusive goals of BTC:
1) High fees and small blocks to support mining (transaction fees &gt; mining reward)
2) LN works best with low fees and fast settlement for opening and closing channels.

Miners do want profit - to capture as many profitable transaction fees as possible. The more transactions, the more profit.
1GB of space does enable many use cases. Miners won't sell blockspace for less than it costs. Bandwidth, computation, and storage point towards transaction fees less than $0.0000001 today. That cost decreases with progress.
Bitcoin BTC won't ever increase the blocksize - it's not on any roadmap. That ship sailed in 2015.
