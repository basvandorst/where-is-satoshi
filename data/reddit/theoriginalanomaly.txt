If there is difficulty in getting bitcoin, and there is a demand for it, then there is also an opportunity. I am not saying you should rake your friends over the coals, but providing a method for them to give you cash, and you to give them bitcoin is certainly deserving of a small fee. 
As for the long term, I don't think it will always be this difficult.

Let me rephrase your point the way I read it. The problem is, someone who has never worked a day in their life, and is in the early 20s, and has only existed as a consumer, cannot magically make a pile of money appear, so that they can outbid everyone else on a product produced by someone else. This is bad cause they would like a nice house and to have kids. Therefore they should be allowed to steal a little bit of money from all the savers, through inflation, and get what they want when they want it. 
Also, renting is a bad option, because kids.
At least that is how I read your objection.
A consumer driven model is unsustainable, produces bubbles, and punishes those who live below their means and save, and enriches those that live above their means. Is it not easy to see that this drives unsustainable consumption, and on the way produces ecological disaster?

The internet has been around since the 60's and 70's. Mosaic was just a great new way to access it. 5 years and 1/300th is pretty damn good for being so difficult to access. Developers are working pretty hard to make it easier to store, hold, use safely. Plus, ideas spread much faster now... cause we have the internet.

You could always implement a method like that and run it through some obscure hashes to add some security. Though if you pick a popular hash and just hash it once it will be more secure, but still not super safe. The more hashes, the better. The order of, and  number of different hashes, and the quantity of hashing can add a lot more security. Or xor it with a passphrase block cipher. There are a lot of options to use this kind of method if you know how to do some programming.

There are a few people I have talked to who didn't want to buy any cause they didn't want to invest enough to get a whole bitcoin. The idea of buying a half or a tenth was not appealing. That said, if ticker symbols are are displayed in closer range to what a dollar is worth, it may be helpful. However, I really don't think it will matter much in the endgame. They probably wouldn't have bought a bitcoin at 4.50$ cause they didn't think it'd be worth that much either... in fact they didn't.

I'm self employed... and I would be asking for bitcoin if it was easy for customers to do. At the moment it is not. Asking a customer that doesn't really know me to link their bank account to some site they've never heard of, and to purchase some weird thing they've never heard of would not come across well. Hopefully PayPal integration will make it easier. Then I could spend it more often too.

That is the key that we are agreeing to use when encrypting data and sending it to each other. We both have the shared secret key of 6.  
So when I send you text I am going to first add 6 to each letter. So a = f, b = g... etc so when you get the text, you take the characters and subtract 6. 
Though, that isn't actually how it works, It actually gets xored. It is a binary operation. 1 xor 0 = 1  ;  0 xor 1 = 1 ;   1 xor 1 = 0   ;   0 xor 0 = 0.
Xor is used because there are 2 possible positions for a bit, 0 or 1, and the xor operation has a 50/50 chance of being a 0 or a 1... so it is evenly distributed outcome.

Speech is supposedly protected, yet, if you send data through a wire it is no longer protected? So I suppose if your speech gets digitized in a protocol such as VOIP or Bitcoin... then it needs to get regulated? No one owns a single bitcoin. You control a signature. With that signature you can  address others in a public way, that they provided a quantity of value to you. It isn't a money, it is a ledger. It is well documented public speech in the form of a protocol. Taxing speech is ludicrous!
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:45:25
You don't regulate gold, you don't regulate money, you regulate what humans do with it. Saying "regulate bitcoin" is essentially just shorthand for saying bitcoin is seen as a legal asset. If you would like someone to be arrested for stealing your bitcoins, then you would like to see it legally defined as an asset. If it was just an entry in a public database, then no one can steal it from you... it's just a public entry, and not owned.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the keyspace in bitcoin isn't really the op's question, but it seems rather the seed size in the random number generator. And that would depend on the implementation of the pseudo random number generator. Some prng's seed size is many orders of magnitude smaller in comparison, something like 2^70, which would make it a poor choice, but should hold for a while. In my opinion, you'd be better off trying to crack poorly constructed brain wallets.

Offering longer and longer terms to a loan does not save the consumer money on buying a house. It allows for spenders to outbid savers with further and further out consequence. This not only creates inflation of the money supply, but it inflates house prices. If you couldn't go and sign a paper to get 250,000 at a cost of 1k a month to buy a house, you would have to save up to buy a large purchase. But you wouldn't have to save up 250,000, as house prices would need to come down to a level that is more affordable. Deflation means you have to save for less time.
Its not like home ownership will go away with a deflationary currency. Yes the 30 year mortgage with no money down, and no payments for 6 months might disappear, but houses will be built, sold, and bought.

Bitcoin the network is a networked ledger. Bitcoin the currency is a nominal entry tied into the ledger.
To use bitcoin, you keep a secret file that allows you to make entries on the ledger, and therefore possibly transfer bitcoin the currency.
Wallets is software that helps to make entries on the ledger easier, and it uses your secret file.

You can use it on a daily basis. Not sure why you conflate paying fees with not usable. I do hope everyone who doesn't value the network (those that think they shouldn't have to pay fees), do leave. When block rewards diminish, we'll either lose security.... or pay higher fees.

It doesn't discourage spending, it is a natural price discovery of current value and future productivity gains. Artificially low rates encourage spending artificially. It literally creates boom and bust cycles by reducing the cost of risk. In other words it spurs malinvestment. Not to mention a constant debt based and throw away culture. This doesn't even touch on the amount of control issuers get, or the lack of oversight of government spending by it's citizenry, due to inflationary taxes being easier to extract. So, sure it would decrease spending in poor investments, but not in ones that would create productivity gains.

Fees will get lower when the value rises. You don't even have to issue a fee, and it may get rolled up into the chain eventually. But likely you'll have to wait a long time. Miners set the fees more or less, they can choose which transactions they will put in, and they will prioritize transactions with higher fees

It all seems so magical. Nodes just broadcast messages, and miners add them to the ledger. Too bad your system is completely unusable... it's as if your missing something... perhaps a user, and a key for signatures to request changes to the ledger. If we could for a moment entertain the possibility that our universe doesn't use magic. Perhaps we could develop some software to make bitcoin actually functional. Perhaps we could develop something that stores or uses keys to sign transactions, and then broadcast those transactions to request it to be added to the ledger. That would make it, not only functional, but also easier for a user to make entries in the ledger. Nah, fuck let's just stick with magic telepathy.
@_date: 2015-02-24 10:12:23

Learn a bit about it before you start trying to correct people. Or just grow up and quit trolling. Miners don't make the transactions, they don't have the keys to make the signature. They simply choose which transactions to roll into a new block. They secure the ledger, and add on to it.

Again, you fail and yet continue. You just admitted that wallets creates and broadcasts transactions. Something so far you have been unwilling to do. Congrats you are getting there.

@_date: 2015-02-03 04:52:24
Right exactly. We were discussing how to explain the basics of bitcoin to a layman. Miners are not laymen to bitcoin, users are. As a user you do alter the ledger. If users could not alter the block chain, we would not be here discussing bitcoin, as there would be no users. Wallets help to make that easier. 
""My system is completely unusable" I'm not writing the bitcoin whitepaper, I'm explaining how your post was wrong."
How about this. What are wallets for, if not for creating transactions and broadcasting them? 
If your goal is to impress people with your knowledge, then you are not explaining bitcoin in as simple terms as you could be. And if your goal is to impress people with your knowledge, then you should definitely not stick to failed arguments once you realize you were wrong.
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:12:12
And how do the nodes get the transaction? Perhaps wallets broadcast it to them? Nodes relay the broadcast. Miners don't write the entries, as you said they choose to include them or not into a new block. They don't make the entries.
