Yes, it just doesn’t get a Segwit fee.  But Coinbase eats the withdrawal fee so no impact to you.  
I was skeptical but did just this very thing yesterday - successfully.

Uh, no.   Not sure how many “big BTC users” you associate with to come up with that speculation. Quite the opposite, USB drives are the last thing serious holders would consider using.  Hardware wallets  dominate this space by far.

What exactly are the barriers for exchanges to implement Segwit?  Seems like just two:
* Utilize Core 0.13.1 or later
* Enable BIP49-derived Segwit addressing in custodial wallets and vaults
Even if exchanges have to modify core for their needs, it does seem like an awkwardly long time for something as simple as this - even factoring in the time wasted on B2X.   And Coinbase even deferred the effort to accommodate BCH.

The attackers just had to short B2X futures with significant leverage prior to their announcement to profit far more than they would from dips and alts.

EDA was really not to ensure ten minute blocks.  It was the to facilitate the gaming of hash power between chains.  The purpose of the new DAA is stability because they need it now - for credibility with those to whom the coin is being peddled.

Tried Shapeshift.io for this yesterday and BCH was marked “unavailable” as the input currency .  I used Changelly.com instead.  
Keep in mind that the exchange estimate when you start is just that - an estimate.  The input transaction has to get confirmed six times before the exchange is executed so the rate could change in the meantime.  For example, I started with the rate at 0.21 BTC-BCH and it was 0.20 after the six confirms.  Not a big deal as was essentially a liquidation at $1,430 per BCH - a price I never thought I’d see again so I’m happy. 
TL;DR:   If the block times are long for BCH when you try this the risk of the exchange rate changing is a consideration.

Let's not overlook the obvious - linearly scaling the block size only linearly scales the transaction capacity.  Going from 1MB to 100MB blocks (discounting use of Segwit) is a x100 increase.  Still way off from the Visa / PayPal rate everyone seems to believe is a design target.
Scaling to these levels requires a layer two solution that utilizes the base layer for settlement.

I would be comfortable with this presentation if it was prefaced with "When viewing Bitcoin through the lens of classical valuation theory...".
Most troubling especially given the OP is a recognized expert in valuation, is the analysis fails to consider the very attributes that users of Bitcoin value - decentralization, censorship-resistance, fixed supply/deflationary, etc.   Just because classical valuation theory hasn't had to treat these as variables in the past doesn't mean they're not front and center with cryptocurrencies.

More accurately, it’s a reference node implementation that contains a wallet.  In this version, multiple wallets are supported.

Noob question - 
If Slush Pool is N2X then why have there been 3 blocks mined by them in the past day with NYA in the coinbase text?  (blocks 489556, 489603 and 489639 per coin.dance)    
Can miners signal differently than the stated intentions of the pool to which they belong?
