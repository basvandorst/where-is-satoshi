Can you warn them about limitid scalability? Limited block sizes? And therefore low liquidity? 
Are you able to advise unto other coins ie litecoin, monero, etc? 
How do people feel about slow transactioms and high fees? Or are they drunk off that upswing? I hope they realize its not forever...

If you can't handle uncertainty, and aren't prepared to lose every penny you've invested, then you shouldn't invest. It is inherently risky, and 20% swings are routine

But my portfolio had a number that was way more than I put in, and now it has slightly less but still way more than I put in. I dont want it to go to zero, better sell

It's not about the short game. If you believe in it, this is just an opportunity to get more at a discount. Don't try to time the market. It doesnt work

If my friends hadn't lived in a place with such easy access to everything they needed, I probably would have bought bolitcoin earlier too... I tried when it was sub 100, but it was complicated and I gave up quickly... It was easier for my friends to find what they needed on the street... Damn it.

Oh I know... Ive known about bitcoin as a concept since it was 20. I told myself to buy every step of the way, but it was always too expensive, or I had other things to spend my money on. It wasn't a priority. I absolutely would have sold many times. Probably not my entore stake as ive invested in other markets for years, but I absolutely would have taken profit... Shit... I got in hella late and I still plan on taking profit (provided its available) after the fork

Its going parabolic before the fork. There will be a big sell off after and other cryptos will gain value

I am playing the long game. Part of a successful strategy is to sell some of your holding at peaks to diversify, then buy again at the dip... Again, I wont be trading my entire position, just a portion. Overall im in it for the long haul and will be continually increasing my stakes over time

I have certain things that force me to stay in this area, additionally its where my cliens are. In order to run my business I need a large pool of high end restaurants and hotels to service. Without these businesses to service, I have no income
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:31:14
I have a job, dude. Thanks though
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:35:33
I'm in a skilled labor field. I started my own business almost two years ago after ten years in the trade. I make alright money, but living in the bay area is expensive, and running a business is expensive... So, for now, until I can build my clientele, I live in my work van
