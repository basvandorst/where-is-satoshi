I was in a five star restaurant in Miami Beach and over heard the maître d' try to take a Sonic to-go cup from someone.  I heard a deep southern drawl belt out, "No! That's my roadie!" 
And that's how you find a fellow Arkansan.  So of course I offered a drink on me at the bar to replace the one so rudely taken.

I’d like to jump in here and add, this was a Clipper chip and encryption joke. At the time there was a big public discussion about the future of cryptography in America because strong encryption was regulated by the same laws that governed nuclear weapons. A hold over from WWII. If you wanted a web browser that supported 128-bit SSL connections (say, for banking), you had get a US only copy “not for export”. 
The public wanted to do away with the law. The Clinton administration wanted a “Clipper chip” included in all electronics, hardware encryption with a government backdoor. 
In response online activists started pushing out all sorts of accessible cryptography. “Pretty Good Privacy”, or PGP encryption is one that did actually catch on. 
Israeli firms really started capitalizing on the US export ban. Despite the US private sector having the technology lead, the export laws created a product vacuum around the world. Silicon Valley predictably started flipping its shit about being hamstrung by an archaic export law. So the Clinton administration finally killed clipper and adjusted weapons export law to match reality. 
And while I have you here. Stop with all the posts about the Simpsons predicting iPhones, too. It was called an Apple Newton, we had mobile devices in the 90s.

I can do this, too. Do people just forget the 20th century existed?

I’m actually old enough to remember the show from its beginning on the Tracy Chapman show. I assumed you were either a kid or a stoner to be trying to read so much into what we’re at best mediocre Simpson’s jokes about things that were already comedy and/or sci-fi staples.

You’ll have to link what your talking about. But, uh, you know we’ve been shoving computers, televisions, remote controls, and everything else into watches since the 80s. 
I got my first Casio Databank as a kid in ‘86.
