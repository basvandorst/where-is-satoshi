My Aunt was detained for public intoxication one evening.  she was out by herself and was told by police she had to be taken downtown for her safety.  while she was downtown they put her in a cell.  She was on her period and had to change her pad badly. she didn't know what to do with it because no trash can and you can't flush it.  she called for a guard, no one came. so she rolled up the pad and put it outside the bars of the cell.
In the local paper according to the police report, she shat herself in her pants while waiting in detention and wiped blood all over the floor and refused to clean it up.
I have learned to never trust anyone accused in police reports.

But why would the extra coins just vanish.  Wouldnt they just go back to the original wallet?  It doesnt make sense that the change from a paper wallet would just go poof.

Can someone here please ELI5 on where I safely buy bitcoins without being ripped off. i'm in the us and interested in investing a spare 5k.

I just want to find a place where I can get bitcoins without having to jump through 50 hoops on fire over a pit of snakes.  WHY IS IT SO HARD TO BUY BITCOINS

I've been researching for 5 hours now and STILL don't know where the hell to buy coins safely,  every place has sketchy reviews.  I've downloaded bitcoin wallet but I'm confused because some of the places seem to hold onto your bitcoins. I thought bitcoins were sent directly to your wallet via code?
@_date: 2013-11-22 03:20:26
but how do you get hold of the coins.  does the 'bank' still have them, but say they are yours?  or is there a key that locks them to you?

If bitcoins ever EVER Drop back below $400 I've got 7 k to invest, please tell me how you ordered your bitcoins so I can be prepared?

Really though, how long does it take to mine one block?  back in 2010 when I heard about bitcoins I looked them up cause I wanted to buy some or mine them.  I had no idea how to even start ....  so I didn't, its a shame, I would a made a killing.  so if I were to mine, how long would it take?
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:25:29
