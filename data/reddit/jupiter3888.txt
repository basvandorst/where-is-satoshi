Don't be sad friend, you were a pioneer helping to cut a path through untrodden lands.

Just saw this new one pop up over in it accepts BTC, ltc and doge. Can not verify that it is legit or not. Seems to ship out of India and Singapore.

well [this]( thread says that way back in may 2011 you could have been mining 1 block (50 bitcoins) every ~20 days, but by now that will be way longer. 
but I said fuck and did some digging...
using [THIS GFX CARD HASH RATE COMPARISON RATE]( with [THIS CALCULATOR]( gives me a nice little table:
	Coins	Dollars
    per Day	฿0.14	$2.03 
    per Week	฿0.97	$14.20
    per Month	฿4.21	$61.66
 
so its not actually that bad if you have it running 24/7 and not paying for electricity. set it up on a mining pool and see how it goes :)
edit: should note that the payout will decrease over time as difficulty increases.

Depends on how good/how many graphics cards you have. I don't do it because I don't have the hardware but basically if you want to be making more than the amount you spend on the electricity to mine you need some fairly top of the line GPU's.

Oh, oh wow. Sorry, I haven't bought off coin base before so I thought the price was "locked in" at what the exchange rate was at the time of purchase.

The tipbot won't post a verification reply if the tipee does not include the word 'verify' in the tip. It still sends a pm though

Good work

If you were to introduced 1.5 million dollars worth of ASIC miners all at once you would end up drastically reducing the time for each block to be found until the network recalculates the difficulty every 2016 blocks (approx 2 weeks). Because you would be producing a large percentage of all coins mined during that time and if you hoarded them you would end up starving the supply and probably driving the price up. If you then dumped them all at once the price would drop like a brick. Sure you could take the De Beers method of fake scarcity and slowly trickle them out but we would know from the block chain that somebody is producing and hoarding large amounts of coins. What happens then is anybodies guess. 
Don't do it if you want bitcoin to survive.

It will pm you a verify message by default but won't post a reply verification message unless you tell it to with 'verify' in to stop it looking "spammy" in threads.

very cool, I just so happened to be listening to it when it broke the $100 barrier and there was a CASCADE of transactions/trades as all the auto-bots sold at the $100 trigger :)

only if you want the bot to publicly post a reply stating that the transfer worked.

But if I want to run a full node/client I need to download a full FIVE POINT SIX GIGABYTES! (well actually, it's from the last [block chain lockin]( *and* it's compressed so it's not as much but it's still a lot). 
Ideally I would think a block chain download of &lt;100MB would be sufficient and would promote more people to setup full, independent nodes
@_date: 2013-01-20 11:45:25
Yeah, I found that out the hard way. Spent a month or 2 building up to .2btc and tried to transfer it out only to have it error out on me :(
@_date: 2013-07-07 23:49:23
Http://Bitpiggy.herokuapp.com is pretty easy with internet bank transfer but they've been having a bit of trouble lately getting enough bitcoins to sell. 
I've been using them for over a year.

There might be charitable miners that will include these zero fee transactions in their block mining as an act of good faith or something 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:16:01
Maybe we could get more activity. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:49:33
Who says it's an expensive lesson? If you sell at the moment, then yes, but if it goes up above what you bought at then it is a profit. Check back in a week and see how it is

Megahash per second or in other words, how many millions of hashes per second. each hash is a try at solving the next block in the bitcoin blockchain.

Much better for bitcoin to be attacked and flats discovered + fixed now than in the future when way more finances are at stake
