I was not saying that they are not obligated. You're right of course they are. That being said, they do not know my identity, and I am using their service. My issue is not rendering the service useless, it is just one of the addresses on the account.

IMO, the biggest problem with bitcoin is a massive centralization of hashing power. We now having hashing power devoted to a couple pools, and we're past the stage of ASIC's and the industry has professionalized. How can Bitcoin tout being a decentralized currency if mining is being centralized into the hands of the few?

What's your biggest concern for 2014? Related to bitcoin, politics, finance, etc. I'm interested in the big picture. Thanks for the ama

The layers on bitcoin are still being built, but yes right now it's not as secure as chase. And you can always create paper wallets
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:31:50
all the transactions have been confirmed hundreds of times yes. I think there is an easily correctable glitch (I believe with the calendar because this happened on Jan 1), that withdrew money from my wallet, and now coinbase does not want to tell me i have more money in the wallet, because it is trying to make up for that deficit. 
I realize coinbase is small, I was actually checking out a legal position availability the other day, but at least a "Hey, yeah we see an issue, too, I'll look into it," or something to that effect would put me at ease. 
I am upset because I am finally on vacation for the first time in years and I can't enjoy myself knowing that my miners back at home aren't seeing payouts. :(
EDIT: I think coinbase must have an incredibly strong interest in customer service urgency, because many of the early adopters are so wary of online wallets that coinbase has to fight that established thinking.

i know that? is that your definition of libarism? even after a google search im clueless.. you're missing my point, too btw. When I say money supply. i also mean "entities that control money."
@_date: 2014-04-21 19:00:05
A currency will struggle to function if a single entity possesses the new creation of coins and does not have a monopoly of violence over the people who use it. I was aware that that was the motivating force behind mass adoption; decentralized creation.

English is my first language. That sentence seems quite clear to me. If coinbase only accepts deposits from the addresses the account owner controls, how in the world do they intend to be a service for merchants?

Well we've had countries try to start their own crypto, and they've failed. But if you mean adopt in the sense that they'll use bitcoins to transfer wealth. Sure! That's the fucking point. Crypto gives you the OPTION to use them or not, and that means MC is welcome to join the space. They can create a credit system based on Bitcoin just like they build a credit system on USD.


 You're right its a payment protocol, its a an open system anyone can build layers on top of. Bitcoin is not going to just plop down and run legacy payments out of business; it allows them to join in. If it's a better model, companies will evolve with it, or other companies' superior business models will take marketshare. 
is fine because they rip on the mentality of the whole "OMG $10,000 coins by December 15th, hold on to your butts!" is pretty comical, and I agree, does a hilarious job of exploiting those comment; I subscribe. But their analysis of the technology is shallow and their comedy relies on making fun of the users rather than the technology itself. It's programmable and its changeable. The problems pointed out can be solved. No movement is without itself selfish players or failed ideas, or without its critics, I guess. 
Oh man, the things I do to avoid studying for my evidence final.

Why the hell has no one mentioned scrypt-n or x11 mining. Gpu mining is not dead. Don't mine scrypt 
@_date: 2014-11-26 06:04:09
This is a terrible idea.
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:26:29
alright well we're definitely way off topic. If coinbase means to treat merchants and users differently, they should do a better job of parsing the two types of accounts instead of giving every account "merchant options." Seems quite ambiguous and overly complicated when I can just say, "Hey, this is my BTC address, and my service/product," and stick with the general options for individual addresses for clients. 
Or honestly better yet, use my own personal wallet and just transfer to coinbase for links to fiat. 
The main point, and a complaint I have seen replicated a few times before my problem, is that coinbase should allow for a failover wallet instead of simply dumping coins somewhere else in a case similar to this. but thats my .02
After browsing which I overlooked from the beginning, it seems many people are playing the waiting game, and I am optimistically hoping this will all be resolved by the end of the month. Until then, I'll just watch the payouts pile up on the blockchain, or move the payments to an offline wallet. 
Thanks for your help, @_date: 2014-05-31 18:12:08
Nope. Mine x11 or scrypt-n. I use nicehash.com
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:58:45
Ah. sorry if it was not factually clear.. And yes, coinbase is my mining default address. KYC/AML would absolutely apply. Thanks for your response. 
IF this is the case, then Coinbase could easily handle this a different way, instead of just disappearing my money.  I also do not believe that is the reason for the discrepancy value, though. This is only one miner directed towards one of the addresses on the account that has showed a withdrawal on the blockchain, and no subsequent deposits (I have never withdrawn from the account). The other address on the account is a landing point for another miner, and has been chugging away with no issues.
Furthermore, I have never registered a real name, bank account, or any personal identifying information on the account, so I am not sure how, if Coinbase is obligated to comply with KYC laws, I am able to do anything with coinbase at all.

That is a blanket term that is not applicable in every situation where money is held by one party on behalf of another.
Lawyers hold money on behalf of customers as a trusted entity - not a bank..
Furthermore, banks have a number of roles that not all depository institutions have; **invests money deposited by customers**, pays it out when required, **makes loans at interest**, and exchanges currency.
The term you want is a depository institution, which is a much more blanket term than a bank and would encompass Bitfinex here. Calling Bitfinex a bank implies a lot of things Bitfinex was not doing. Bitfinex should not be treated as a bank, nor should any Bitcoin exchange be treated as a bank. This has been repeated ad nauseum on this forum and elsewhere. The point of Bitcoin is empower yourself by holding your own money, not trusting anyone else but yourself. Anyone that allows a 3rd party to hold their money (without some other purpose besides simply holding).... well, WOOSH! 
For every "hack" or "breach" in Bitcoin, [I can point to a much more damaging "hack" or "breach" in our current mainstream financial system.]( While its cute to point out and laugh at shortcomings and failures of businesses in a completely new industry, it is expected. There are smart people in crypto, and they're not all honest. Everyone here knows (or should know) that they're operating in a high risk/high reward space.
Furthermore, I'm not familiar with Bitfinex's plan to remedy the financial situation of those affected, but they're on the hook to do so, and I'm fairly confident they will. I personally have no funds with them.
EDIT: I should also point out that the space is working to eliminate points of centralization in Bitcoin with new and decentralized exchange technologies that I am honestly not too familiar with. So, like I said, growing pains; technology is being developed that will circumvent these types of breaches.

I understand the societal implications of a decentralized, self-working monetary system. Trust me, I am in love with that idea. but I don't understand it as a long term solution in light of increasing difficulty and the ability for fewer and fewer specialized players to mine.
