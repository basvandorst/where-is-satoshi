This is an order to deal with overseas hackers.  This provides a framework for which to deal with would be hackers.  It does however, contain a provision that states people who donate to these hackers would also be considered criminals.  Although I think the main intent of this Executive Order is to deal with hackers.  Thank Sony for their terrible security practices.

That dude at the beginning sure has a big head.

So there are buy orders, but no one is selling?  It seems that the price of bitcoin will need to rise to entice sellers.

Iceland is a country with a total population of around 325,000.  They have a bigger problem with incest than they do with currency.  They even [created an app]( for your phone to prevent people from hooking up with their cousins.

Thank you for clearing that up.

Woah.  I read that as "Changetip Shuts Down".  I was worried for a second.

When do you ever see the back of the drummer?  Do they have a camera guy behind you while you play?  I hope so, but as others have stated people will just think this is a link to a website.  Congrats on playing Letterman.  Also, please tell us a little more about you, your band, your musical experience, where your from.    People, like me may not be familiar with you.

Had to unexpectedly reset my iphone the other day.  Downloaded the app and as soon as I entered my login details it was back to normal.  SO SIMPLE.  I am truly impressed.

Why did this come from  and not from   Is twitter limiting the API calls?

I've heard a lot of big ideas surrounding Factom.  Of the similar projects out there, they seem to be pretty far along.  I like the idea of using the Bitcoin Blockchain for data point storage, and think that this could apply widely to other areas, but the question I have is:  Will they deliver?  
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:32:07
I like the idea of cold storage, and it is clever to store a usb drive in the coin case.  But did you say, The only way to get the private keys out would be to smash the container?  It seems like a bad idea to smash something containing a micro sd card.

Congrats.  Next step, try not to check how much it's worth every hour.

i agree that people are already building a lot of the infrastructure Coinbase was talking about.  But if it doesn't flow through Coinbase, there is no financial incentive for them.  Coinbase wants all of the bitcoin transaction volume.

With the lack of original ideas in Hollywood these days, this movie has potential to be huge.

This is funny because it illustrates the agents overall lack of understanding of Bitcoin.  They had heard that is was just like cash.  So, they went about stealing it just like they steal cash.

The fact that they stole something traceable is funny because it illustrates an overall lack of understanding of Bitcoin.
