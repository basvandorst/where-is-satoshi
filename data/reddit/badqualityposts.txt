Anytime someone refuses to acknowledge the point and instead focuses on the trivialities of what a person said, you just know he's bigoted and stuck in his views.

So because Obama wasn't the first, that means its perfectly fine to do it. Also you should be aware that it takes a lot of effort to amend the constitution, it doesn't take much effort to use an executive order. 
Also everything you just said about Trump is guaranteed bullshit. That or its from 30 years ago.

Why do you care about this but not the congressmen who literally have duel citizenship in Israel or the people who keep popping up like George Soros who has openly admitted to wanting the destruction of the United States in his book.
The Russian spy connection conspiracy theory is pure propaganda. OMG Trump has friends in Russia HOLY SHIT ITDS DA COMMIES GUISE!!!!! Trump has many international friends being a billionaire property investor for 50 years now. 
And now you're going to say "which is why he is corrupt, look at the ban list"
To which I will respond Trump would make more money continuing his business then he would spending 4 years in the white house. To be perfectly honest Trump probably could have gotten more work done outside the white house then inside it.   
I would have thought that someone who understands the value of bitcoin wouldn't be retarded enough to listen to MSM at all.

Actshually rednecks are the only people in this country actually having children. Everyone else just relies on immigrants to keep the population artificially growing.
