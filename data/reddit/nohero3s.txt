I jumped on BTC when it was originally coming out and everyone was ignoring it. I laughed at Dogecoin, but over the last few weeks I've participated in that much more. They do have a great community, even though I think it's silly, I do think they are building up some great power and massive clientele base.

This is definitely for the better. Although I am all for everyone owning a gun, the prices and selection on that site were pretty terrible. 
It's also better to not have something as controversial as this drawing unneeded attention to SR and BTC.

Paying someone to hold on to your money, and to use your money. Incredible. =\

It can be a relatively slow mining process depending on your computer setup. I have gotten as far as 0.00 as well after a day of messing around with things, which was very discouraging.
However, the general consensus is that using your GPU instead of your CPU will benefit you much better.

They should go after cash too, since cash has traditionally been used in nearly 100% of drug sales.

I would also like to know this. I found plenty of links to Windows specific apps, but not so much OS X.

I went to CVS last Thursday or Friday and made a cash payment, bitinstant had the cash in my Mt Gox account by the time I got home.
