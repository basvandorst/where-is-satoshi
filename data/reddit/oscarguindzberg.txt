The service that bitfinex uses to store its btc
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:58:22
Here is the code I used to find out which keys were used

I have no secret/inside information. I just gathered/processed public info. The txs show keys 1 and 3 were used. If you open a bitgo account, you will notice key 1 is yours, key 2 is backup, key 3 is stored by bitgo. I am not sure whether the hacker had access to the private keys or she managed to control a process that has access to the keys (some ideas on other comments).

Yes. The txs stealing the funds spend P2SH multisig outputs. The tx input format is OP_0 [A's signature] [B's or C's signature] [serialized redeem script] where serialized redeem script is OP_2 [A's pubkey] [B's pubkey] [C's pubkey] OP_3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG. You just have to check the signatures against the pubkeys and see which ones were used.

Looks like the attacker obtained bitfinex private key and one of these:
a) bitgo's private key
b) bitfinex bitgo's username and password and authy's credentials (that allows the hacker to create new api access tokens and remove daily limits)
c) bitfinex bitgo's api access token

Bitgo should not be out of business, since apparently is not their fault. Having said that, there are a number of things to improve on the bitgo side. At least it is not well documented how their system reacts to panic situations, eg someone changing the daily limit, whether they notify you when you are about to reach the daily limit, whether they have hourly limits, if there is a mechanism for manual approval after certain limits.

Another option is an attack on the Bitgo instant system. Bitfinex accepts zero confirmation txs as long as they are cosigned by bitgo. The attacker may have somehow double spent those funds. Not very likely IMO.

You can not figure out the public keys if you just have the p2sh multisig outputs. But here I have txs spending those outputs. The redeem script is embedded the input script. Input script format is OP_0 [A's signature] [B's or C's signature] [serialized redeem script]. The redeem script format is OP_2 [A's pubkey] [B's pubkey] [C's pubkey] OP_3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG

Private keys 1 and 3 of the 2-of-3 multisig were used to steal the funds. Key 1 is bitfinex key, key 3 is the bitgo key. Backup key was not used.
I checked that on theses txs
Looks like the attacker obtained bitfinex private key and 
a) bitgo private key
b) bitfinex's bitgo's username and password and authy's credentials (that allows the hacker to create new tokens and remove daily limits) or
c) bitfinex's bitgo's token

You can get that info from the tx inputs. The inputs have 2  signatures and 3 public keys. You just have to test signature/public key match. I had to write some code to get that info.

I contributed to Microwork.io . They developed a service where human providers get paid in bitcoin to do small tasks

They were covered by mainstream argentina press. eg  (link in spanish)

CoinJoin is another approach
