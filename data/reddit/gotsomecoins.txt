It means that the song is about her... about her youth and naivite.

The criminal action targeted "HSBC Bank USA NA" which is the official name of the US subsidiary. As far as I'm aware the US subsidiary was not accepting cash deposits from Mexican drug dealers.

How exactly is any bank on the receiving end of an international wire supposed to know how the cash was deposited into the originating account?
To the extent the problem was large cash deposits as reported in the media, the enforcement action should surely have been taken by the Mexican government and targeted the institution that actually broke the law....

The US subsidiary is not the parent company of HSBC Mexico....

I actually got a fantastic price from BTCTrip the other day. In the past they had been more expensive, so maybe they've upgraded their systems. Worth checking them out too anyway.

I think you mean that small businesses pay 6% on each transaction. Half when receiving cash and half when spending it.

The deposits were accepted by HSBC Mexico, a Mexican subsidiary that has nothing to do with the United States. If accepting those deposits was illegal, it should have been the Mexican government prosecuting.
Maybe you should park your patriotism and question why it is always foreign banks on the receiving end of major fines.
