My sentiment exactly. Yea there's a chance some huge event will cause Bitcoin to crash but with a limited supply of Bitcoins and infinite decentralized applications I'm optimistic.

Too many people trying to daytrade BTC... either buy and hold or trade something more predictable.

The sad truth is we're all hoping for China to drive up the BTC price and a factor in that is money laundering / dirty money changing hands in China.
QED More fentanyl = higher BTC

No offense to theymos, but that's a theory. Not a fact. There's no 'was not sustainable, here's why'. You should say: Here is an opinion on why it's not sustainable. I could link to several hundred redditor comments stating it will go anywhere from 500 to 1 million / BTC

Bitcoin is secured using the same encryption form everything else on the internet thats "secured" uses, so if that happens RIP everything

When have they ever stolen BTC? Besides.. he can always buy on coinbase then transfer to an offline, cd storage, trezor, paper etc wallet.. "you really want to trade seriously.. use X" makes you sound like you either have a stake in the company or have absolutely no clue what youre talking about

Something you have knowledge of the factors aeffecting it, such as stocks, options, etc. Trade what you know. I realize nothing is really predictable but basically what I meant to say was it's 100% gambling unless you have some special knowledge. I'm sure there are those with inner workings of BTC but I've been talking to too many people who think "Well, trading stocks is hard but speculating on BTC is easy profit!" ..Not really. There are proven strategies that can make money speculating on stocks and other securities. BTC is relatively new so there is less information out there.
