Ugh I can feel the retardation radiating from those comments.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:33:55
This is no joke, my Nan saw something about bitcoin so decided to google it, somehow she ended up getting a call from some foreign dude who was asking for details. Make sure you help them as much as possible, offer your time to help them get set up. Most people only want to buy it and hodl it so it's pretty easy when they don't have to do anything but look after the private key.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:32:46
I'm with you
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:44:48
There will be ways around it.
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:37:12
I got burned and keep getting burned trying to catch these falling knives haha but im enjoying my time in this community. He must have lost a lot of what he wasnt prepared to lose. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:26:16
You can build big walls
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:19:54
What are you basing your opinion on  man, your own sentiment or what?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:07:44
Not necessarily. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:08:07
Same bro lmao
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:23:58
Same I'd but it all on btc. The fork won't destroy it. Long live BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:25:14
So is there anything in there?
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:33:13
So you think there's definitely going to be a drop at the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:00:58
Yea bro good luck let us know :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:15:47
COngrats bro! I own 0.2 currently, will take me a another 6 months to afford 1 I could imagine unless IM ruthless and dont spend anything! I'm also investing the traditional way and I also need to save for future expenses... GAH
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:13:42
I'm a noob who bought at 7400 just bought more now. Cheahoo.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:12:00
What? how? Alts?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:11:49
Duuuuuuuude you are so right about the paypal 2.0 comment... Damn...
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:11:04
Love this.

When I was younger I saw a little bitcoin symbol on some page I was on so decided to have a gander, too young to understand and now i regret not being more curious about it but hey, hindsight is a bitch.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:22:28
Thanks  for these comments guys, interesting shit.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:55:18
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:17:40
I couldn't agree more, seeing 1btc in my wallet would be great though. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:59:24
Also it's just an easy way to store wealth just like gold. It is definitely digital gold. I'm going to chuck a lot into btc but im just not sure if i should wait until after the fork or not. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:44:30
Lol I love this. If we ever hit 1m.. wtf.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:08:16
Good point
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:23:59
No other alts?
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:22:09
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:32:40
It's a good thing for me, I want a whole bitcoin so catastrophe not really but I see what you mean. If you've finished buying good for you.
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:20:00
problem for me as in New Zealand we don't have any decent exchanges where you can do this. We used to have Cryptopia but their bank shut down their account. Also the ammount of slippage buying bitcoin then transferring to binance and changing it to usdt to place limit orders is insane. Can be a lot especially during volatility. So for me the only real option is DCA every week / month into sites like Easy Crypto and Vimba (mycryptosaver). Less fees that way.
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:39:04
Fear is stronger than greed
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:38:38
I love seeing these because it just reinforces the fact new people are discovering this amazing tech each day of every year and won't ever stop.
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:36:48
I guess we make that decision in 2020
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:33:26
24 cents or 23 cents
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:57:53
I hodl because one day i hope to be able to use the tokens/coins i'm hodling. Only have 10 projects and follow them closely. One i'm super excited about it bitdegree because I did bad at school and would like to use it in the future when there are some solid courses set up haha!
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:40:35
yea you can use coinmama but 5% credit cardvfee
@_date: 2018-07-13 03:38:41
What are you on about? You bought when it had an insanely massive run. It's no one else's fault but yours that you were retarded enough to believe you would make anything buying it that high. No one knows what it will do from here, down or up but sulking about it like a manbaby is just annoying. Either sell at a loss or hold and see what happens and stfu. No one likes hearing you whining about your retarded decisions.
So many people are deep in profit still.
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:20:15
I recommend people who don't understand that debt isn't just a bad thing and is actually a crucial part of our current economic system watches the video "the Economic Machine" By Ray Dalio, great video and really lays it out simply on how the Credit and debt economy works. More money lended = more money spended = more income where people are spending.
It's not a perfect system but it's working and we are all more wealthy than ever before. Poverty is being reduced at an insane rate at the cost of inequality.
@_date: 2018-07-12 01:36:51
I would probably say the same, a lot are just so meh.
@_date: 2018-07-13 04:58:34
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:56:40
No worries
@_date: 2018-07-12 01:53:08
This is insanely true on my part as well and would be surprised and impressed if anyone is doing better holding alts over bitcoin. I would have 20% more bitcoin if I just held it and never went into alts.

Same homie
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:30:41
Completely agree.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:37:23
What I meant was - Gave it away to other users on Bitmex cause i had no idea what I was doing.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:09:29
Holy fucking shit I wish I never lost my bitcoin at 3k LOL
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:13:17
Completely and utterly destroyed just like my bitcoin balance on bitmex
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:18:55
A lot of you not being able to concentrate at work because of the price movement, the trick is to get rekt on Bitmex like me! Then it's easy!
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:33:09
i feel
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:25:13
Contact ledge support mate.
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:15:02
You can use a site like coinmama where you can use a credit card but you need to make sure you have a wallet setup first to send the bitcoin to. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:10:42
Hey man, I'm pretty sure if you have 1 or more bitcoin you're doing well for yourself either way in fiat. Remember a lot of people can't afford 1 whole bitcoin even at $800. You're doing great!
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:16:51
I was going to do this but sold and bought a laptop and with the rest I am learning how to short / long. I will probs dca back in over the next few months. I don't trust alts to do too well unless bitcoin gets some growth.
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:07:13
lol at least you're honest bro, probably 90% of people subscribed feel the same way.
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:05:44
Another? Nice bro your part of the ever more exclusive more than 1 btc club haha
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:27:56
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:27:05
Great advice for people just investing imo not worrying much about trading in between
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:28:12
I'm from New Zealand, I've done well in crypto so far at a NET gain. But still have debt from health stuff so can't afford a whole bitcoin right now. It's definitely a goal of mine. 1 bitcoin here is $5000NZD so its quite a lot.
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:13:18
What's important is that you realised your mistake of passing on something based on little to know info. Next time you hear about something interesting like this, just jump into it for an hour! That hour could be your gateway to millions one day.
