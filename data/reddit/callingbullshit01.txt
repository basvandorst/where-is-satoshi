Why would they use a blockchain versus using a centralized database? A centralized system is much more efficient than a blockchain system... The reason the blockchain is useful is because it allows us to build a decentralized and distributed database without having to trust a centralized entity to maintain its integrity.

Huh? Amazon is filled with fakes because they lump items from different vendors into the same bucket. What are you talking about? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:31:23
Actually, what's happening is Amazon is clumping together all products with the same UPC into one big bile (regardless of which vendor it came from). This means that you could purchase something from the legitimate Samsung seller, but still end up receiving a counterfeit product. Amazon has been receiving a ton of flack for this lately, and it's causing a lot of people (myself included) to stop using Amazon for a lot of different things.

@_date: 2015-04-04 15:50:00


Because you don't actually provide any historical examples or connect it to libertarianism in any way. It's just a broad statement.
Increased freedom for one party can (and often times does) mean decreased freedom for another. For example, the whole businesses' rejecting homosexuals in Indiana thing going on right now.


But it does, you initially made the claim that history shows it to be true. Can you provide an example? Freedom is a nice ideal, but I don't think it's something that you can easily define. How would you define freedom? 
Also, I don't really believe that all 'essential state functions' can or would be provided by the 'free market'. Sure there are a lot of things that could probably be done better, but for better or worse there are always going to be regulatory agencies. In some instances that's not really a bad thing.


I can agree with this to an extent, but one important exception is the concept of the state itself. (i.e. a monopoly on violence). I don't think you can prevent that from occurring. One way or another, a 'state' will form.
One more thing, there most definitely have been monopolies that formed that were NOT a result of the state:

@_date: 2015-04-05 02:55:16
You need to work on your reading comprehension man. I didn't say that I support a state or that I'm opposed to anarchism. I said that in an anarchistic system (and libertarianism) we would most likely end up with a state being formed through cartels forming monopolies on violence. Anarchism and Libertarianism are both very broad terms that can be interpreted in VERY different ways. 


That doesn't mean I'm pro authoritarianism, it means that I recognize the pragmatic realities of violence, and that I believe there always have and probably always will be power structures that centralize and exploit that power (i.e. a state). What I am saying is that in order to prevent coercive monopolies on violence from forming, we need to have some types of control structures in place. 
How that power is structured can vary wildly depending on who you ask, even among libertarians and anarchists. Personally I am in favor of decentralized power structures and horizontal hierarchies rather than centralized authorities like we have in place right now.
Anyway, I'm done man. Your reading comprehension sucks and you are taking highly complex issues and dumbing them down into these ideals that you think are infallible. Unfortunately that is just now how things play out in reality.

Yeah, this is just like that. -.-
@_date: 2015-04-04 15:05:00
That's not an argument for libertarianism though. Freedom for who? As far as I know there isn't a single state that could really be considered libertarian that we could compare to (especially since the whole idea of a state goes against the american definition of libertarianism). 
I mean I get it, and I am in agreement with a few libertarian principles, but there are some serious issues with it, imo. For example, how do you prevent cartels from forming and then creating their own monopolies (i.e. a state). 
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:26:23
From an **outside perspective**, it **looks like** you have a problem with semantics.

And he should step down, because he's not serving the best interests of this community. He accuses the members of the very community he's in charge of moderating of being cult-like. He's also a moderator of a community that's dedicated to making fun of and is constantly sending downvote brigades over here. 
Tell me again why he should remain a moderator of this cult-like community that he has no respect for? That's without even mentioning the fact that there are over 160,000 subscribers here. Generalizing all of them as being 'cult-like' is not a very intelligent thing to do.


He is harming the community by deriding the members of it in not only his posts here, but especially in his posts in If he wants to criticize that's fine, but he shouldn't be a moderator of it while holding the opinions of it that he does. Especially when he's also mod of a community that is entirely dedicated towards putting down &gt; In fact, calling out cult like behavior is beneficial to the community. Echo chambers and monocultures are dangerous.

I can certainly agree that that's what's happening right now, and has to a large extent been happening ever since groups of apes started coming together to control one another. 


Well, that's kind of my whole point and the problem I have with libertarianism in general. In principle it sounds like a great idea, but in practice I believe it would just lead us back to where we are, or worse.


There will always be a 'state', imo. I'm not really sure a 'free market' has or ever will exist. Anarchy would eventually give way to a state as well most likely. 
I think the key is to have proper control structures in place so as to prevent the state or anyone from forming monopolies that are harmful to the general population. I would love it if everyone would abide by the NAP and we could all be 'free' without the need for a state, but unfortunately that is just not anywhere close to reality.

@_date: 2015-03-22 16:31:59
I don't think you're understanding what he's saying to you. The reason that bitcoin is setup the way it is with miners having to authenticate transactions is because it's a decentralized trustless system. If your goal is to create a centralized system, then you have no reason to use blockchain technology at all.... It is much more efficient to use SQL, since the authorization happens in a central location. There is no point to have 'miners' in a centralized system, and it's very unlikely that it would be more efficient than a plain SQL setup.
@_date: 2015-03-22 17:49:09
Sure. lol
The 'trustless' aspect of how consensus is achieved is why the way the decentralization is setup is important though. If the authority to transact and obtain balances were centralized to a trusted entity then there's no reason to have miners or a blockchain. It can all just flow through the central authority, which would be more efficient being run as a plain SQL system rather than a blockchain.  
@_date: 2015-03-28 00:24:56
You must be fun at parties.
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:25:22
I totally would like to talk about it more, if you're up for it that is. If you would like maybe we can chat in my IRC server? You can find me by just going here: 
and entering in a username. Or just respond to this or PM me. Either way, thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-22 18:15:59
A centrally controlled "blockchain" is not really a blockchain anymore, it's just a database... To setup a blockchain system with a centralized entity would be pointless and inefficient compared to a SQL system. The whole reason the blockchain exists the way it does is because it allows for consensus to be reached without a centralized entity. 
Also, it's not really a matter of which one is better or worse, they are totally different concepts, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Centralized ledger systems already exist too (e.g. ACH, Swift, etc..)
And sorry, I'm not about to read that web page. It's pretty much an entire book on a single page. If you want to try to explain what you're getting at in a much simpler and concise manner then feel free. I just don't have the time to read an entire book in order to understand the point you're trying to convey.


There system wouldn't involve proof of work or proof of stake, why would it? The proof would be their centralized ledger, which they control entirely.


What? Again, I don't think you're understanding what we're saying. You don't need nodes or miners if there is a centralized entity verifying the transactions. What would be the point? A SQL database and API's that allow people to run certain actions would be much more efficient than trying to use blockchain technology. 
Edit: I just realized that the link you pasted contains numerous different blog posts. I thought it was all just one giant article. My mistake.

I can't cancel it, they've already debited my bank account. I went ahead and added my card and was able to purchase instantly though. I get that fraud is an issue, but it has definitely never been an issue with my account. I'm just annoyed that they didn't give more of a warning when I placed my order. Anyway, you are right, if anything I can just vote with my wallet.
@_date: 2013-10-16 19:18:40
Yeah, I'm not too worried about getting ripped off. Thanks for the assurance though. I really think they should add a notice when purchasing coins that they will no longer be instant though. I now see there is a little box on the side (not in the popup window that confirms), but that's not really enough to catch your eye if you aren't looking for it... Especially if you have already been verified as instant and are accustomed to having your purchase go through right away.

@_date: 2013-11-06 16:57:35
Right. I saw a balance of 3 BTC still there, so I assumed that there was a problem with my previous withdrawal. You would think that if my account really didn't have the funds that they wouldn't allow a duplicate transaction. Then after making that mistake they cancel my FIRST withdrawal, which should be the legitimate one. I feel like someone just saw the problem and decided to push through the later transaction because it was a lesser amount. They then completely removed any record of the original withdrawal having even taken place. Fortunately I got a screenshot with both transaction ID's before that happened.
@_date: 2013-10-16 14:34:37
Maybe they should have added a more noticable warning at the time of purchase..... I got screwed by the same stupid bullshit, and I kind of doubt that my transaction will go through once I add a card. I think it's time for me to find a new marketplace *.

Not quite. Geo-location based on IP is at best 80% accurate or so. And even then it does NOT give an actual street address. Usually it's just a locality that you're able to find. Now if you are a LEO, you can get a warrant and ring up the provider of that IP and get any information they have. 
I'm willing to bet that OP was using a mobile device with location services enabled. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 14:45:40


It's proprietary software, you have no privacy.
@_date: 2013-11-01 14:01:07
And it matched your address exactly? Pretty impressive, it's never worked that well for me. Most Geo-IP API's will only give locality (and are often wrong), so what the original commenter said about any website having your exact location is just not true. The fact that they were able to even guesstimate a street address is because you allowed that website to use location services built into your web browser. 
Your web browser uses as much information about your network as it can to guess a location, and your browser has access to a lot more information than a web server would by default (LAN, for example). You have to explicitly grant the website access for it to be able to get any information from location services. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:54:40
True. I have been wanting to do this for a while, but I'm just lazy. I actually went in one time to close my account, but ended up leaving it open because the bank manager kept assuring me I had a great deal with them because I was still in college (so no fees).
