So nobody has to work? We can just print value tokens and magically everyone will be rich? No.

Making money while you sleep means someone else is working to earn you money. Value is not created out of thin air.

Then enlighten me, where else does the money generated by dividends or interest ultimately come from? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:20:08
Let's see about that. !RemindMe 1 year
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:34:25
Paper money isn't backed by anything. That's why it's called 'Fiat' currency. The only thing the federal reserve does is be the only allowed issuer of it, and as such prevent the value from falling *too* fast.

Use it that way? Then instead of a burrito for $6.50 you have a burrito for 650 sats or 6.50 bits.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:16:11
No there isn't.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:46:41
So how is that any different from this subreddit? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:06:12
I did buy around 20 BTC at $90 as a 'poor' student (basically half my savings). And then I got scammed out of around 15 of them. Bitfunder, Butterflylabs, ASICMINER, ...

Did you mean Bitcoin Cash? That can also use LN.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:14:02
I think it's best to use bits/µBTC. There's a reason many currencies usually have two decimal places. It makes most everyday purchases require only a single digit. So satoshis would be the cents to bit's dollars.
343 sat = 3.43 bits = 0.00000343 BTC
Bitcoin price is currently $0.01701/bit! super cheap!

Are you that thick? It right in the title when you launch it "Bitcoin Core". It's the name of the reference implementation of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:58:56
BCH has the same chain up until the fork, so it jas just as much claim to the Bitcoin name.

txid or it didn't happen
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:55:19
Yeah, sorry, I misread. Once that happens I'm sure there'd be consensus to increase the divisibility of bitcoin further.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:50:16
Yes it would? If it's $5M/btc, 1 bit is 5$ and 1 satoshi is 5 cents. If one bitcoin were to ever reach $100M then, yes, you couldn't address amounts less than 1$. But if it ever were to come to this with enough consensus we could increase the divisibility.

@_date: 2017-11-28 23:17:53
That's precisely why SegWit is so insidious. You don't need consensus for a soft fork. So what do you do when a soft fork gets pushed that you don't agree with? You then have two options, continue using the chain that now contains things you do not agree with, i.e. has been changed, or you hard fork. Bitcoin Cash is people opting for the latter.
@_date: 2012-12-13 11:18:55
What a pointless article. Let me just declare 1 k€ a currency with subdivisions of € and cents and suddenly The k€ is at the top of the list!
@_date: 2011-07-31 18:46:22
But it matters a lot more if it has to do with handling money.
@_date: 2011-07-31 18:56:14
Only a retard (in terms of data security) would lose their wallet.dat. It's all a matter of expertise.
@_date: 2011-07-31 18:59:24
How so?
@_date: 2011-07-31 18:54:15
While they probably will never reach zero, running out of bitcoins does not necessarily mean that there won't be any 'known' bitcoins left. But because (if I'm not mistaken) 10^-8 is the smallest subdivision of a bitcoin the problem that fewer and fewer people have bitcoins will not happen for a while. But for t→∞, the problem remains.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:03:14
Yeah, I was thinking along similar lines when I first heard about the story yesterday. But as you said, there would be easier ways to not give suspicion that you are SN, like not intentionally leaking that info in the first place.
@_date: 2013-03-26 10:50:37
That would violate my right to exercise stupidity!
@_date: 2013-07-27 10:24:50
Honestly, the metal doesn't look realistic at all. Also, why is there reflected text on top of the coins?
For the metal, try something more along the lines of [this]( And build a rudimentary exterior scene that will be visible in the reflections.

"Some wallets"? AFAIK there's absolutely no difference between wallets.
@_date: 2013-02-21 19:06:08
The price will probably drop as more companies enter bitcoin and it feels more 'secure' to them.
@_date: 2013-08-02 23:06:26
U.S. only.
Outside it's 1 BTC for small orders.
@_date: 2013-10-26 08:46:57
Sadly, there's no such link. PayPal Europe seems to be a bit different from the U.S. one.
@_date: 2013-08-18 11:19:45
They are legally required to refund you, on your request, as far as I know.

BTCGuild distributes fees to miners using PPLNS. You could still ask though.

Ask avalon/bfl any other company known to have huge amounts lying around.

Entirely possible, but improbable.

Still overpriced.
| Average difficulty increase   | Total mining income    | Breakeven? (disregarding electricity!)     |
| .2       |          0.6553 BTC|     ☐
| .15  |    0.8374 BTC|  ☐ 
| .125       |        0.9829 BTC|   ☐  
| .1       |        1.2014 BTC|   ☑
| .05       |        2.2936 BTC|   ☑
| .025           |      4.4780 BTC        | ☑
You can get PMB shares for .0035 BTC·s/MH, which works out to just about the same.

If you sell your products on PayPal, you have to ship within 20 days. Additionally, according to FTC regulations, you have to cancel an order if a customer wants you to, if you have not yet shipped the product.

You pay in BTC, you get your mining in BTC. This has nothing to do with fiat exchange rate. If the difficulty rises faster than 12.5% every retarget, you will never get your initial investment of 1 BTC back, regardless of how fast BTC rises.
If you pay in fiat, it'd still be better to just sit on the converted BTC and do nothing.

Ah, okay. I've tried Armory, but the fact that it completely rescans the whole blockchain on every startup is something I find annoying.
 And a few more questions: are change addresses stored in the wallet forever? If yes, are they ever reused once they are emptied?
Why is it necessary to have change addresses, could you not just split up a received transaction into the part you want to send to someone else, and send the rest back to your sending address?
@_date: 2013-08-16 15:53:14
