Did you see the fee charts when coinbase went down? Fees were dropping like crazy and then rose again when coinbase came back online. They need to batch transactions and implement segwit.

Bitcoin has an army of developers. It'd never take 10 years for anything to happen. Bitcoin itself is less than 10 years old.

Still all that matters is the public and private keys. If I own my private key I own my wallet. Even if the private key exists on paper.
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:39:27
Actually this huge decrease is mostly due to a significant increase in hashing power meaning more throughput until next difficulty adjustment.

A bitcoin wallet is just a pair of numbers. They can be generated with very minimal compute power. Good fucking luck regulating a simple math concept.

@_date: 2018-01-23 23:11:00
My point is that if they consciously have to opt for a segwit wallet segwit will fundamentally fail. It should be a default option in all wallets. I mentioned LN because in its current state it's unusable for the majority of people. After looking into it a little I came to the conclusion that if the average user has to think to open a channel, they won't.
At one point in time everyone that used email were computer specialists that didn't mind needing to understand how it works at its core to send a message. Once someone realized how to make things as simple as pressing a button, it became extremely mainstream. The same thing needs to happen to bitcoin. If I ever need to type things into a console to get a feature of my wallet working, the wallet needs to improve.
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:06:38
I don't get why LN capacity is rated in BTC? Is this the total amount in circulation in the network? Is this a cap for the amount anyone can send?
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:15:57
My point is that many people in the community have gotten a little complacent with the complexity of bitcoin. People keep saying "Why isn't segwit being adopted?" I think it's because many people don't realize its better or how to send segwit transactions.

That was probably because the mempool was mostly empty when you were buying your games. Right before steam removed bitcoin transactions it took several hours for a payment to go through.

You can add a fee to your node. Keep in mind the lightning network will use nodes with the lowest fees so don't set your fees too high or else no one will use your node.

The idea with LN is that it'll offer fees significantly lower than VISA so why wouldn't businesses start accepting btc? I'm expecting by the end of the year that LN will be fully functional and will account for the majority of transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:38:39

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:57
Honestly I'd be fine if they removed being able to buy  games directly but still allowed us to put money into our steam wallets. Just send X amounts of BTC to steam and when the transaction gets through you get whatever the exchange rate was. Won't make us repay for games if we add to our steam wallet and verify its enough before we buy.
I don't like them taking away the option completely. They could have added a volatility warning or something but I guess valve is too lazy to do that.
Also they should add paying from alts. Vertcoin looks like a good option since it can be mined at home and can be traded for BTC.

This is big for me. With steam no longer accepting and my unwillingness to sell it seemed like my bitcoins were going to wait in my wallet forever. I guess I'm going to be able to buy more things than I used to if they start accepting it. Hopefully the recent volatility hasn't dissuaded them.

Personally I doubt that the world's largest economy is on the verge of collapse. Keep in mind the US Dollar is closely linked to the stability of the United States. Throughout history the US has been very stable. The only reason Zimbabwe went to shit is because the dictator ran it into the ground to serve his needs, which I kind of doubt will happen to the US.

You realize the protests started because the government raised taxes on gas making people's commutes cost more. They started peacefully enough but quickly devolved into violence for the sake of violence. My hairdresser even commented that she was considering joining the protests afterwards cause they started burning things and it seemed exciting. It's motives were corrupted by those who joined the movement.

It increases transaction throughput more than a simple blocksize increase and I think it paves the way for smart contracts and second layer solutions like LN.

Addressing your final little section:
You don't find small communities anymore for a simple reason: economies of scale. Larger the entity, the cheaper things will be. That's why Europe decided to unite their economies in the EU. It's also why empires expand. It is always cheaper when all parts of the manufacturing process adheres to one entity. You have a nice utopic idea of unparalleled democracy but if history has taught us anything it would quickly devolve into larger nations.

The thing is, you still legally need to report everything to the IRS. If you lie then you have committed a crime. Sure, Bitcoin makes it way harder to get caught but it doesn't change the fact it's a crime. Also keep in mind Bitcoin isn't completely anonymous. If the government has the incentives, I'm sure that they could track it pretty accurately. Maybe a hard-fork to something similar to Monero would slow them down but never expect that something conducted on the internet will ever be 100% anonymous.
