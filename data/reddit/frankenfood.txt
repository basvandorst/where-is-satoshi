Due to the exponential nature modern civ's complexification changes have become exponentially more frequent, not less.
Check into it, you'll be amazed at how many iterations of financial innovations occur in a single 5-year span.
You can start with this guy's MOOC at Columbia business school, (he's a badass)[

cool concept. I love the really old stuff.
There seem to be some major gaps after papyrus. So we go from papyrus to double book accounting? Then from double book to computers?
I understand the necessity of brevity in today's modern age, especially for works of "publicity," as I'm assuming this is. 
Nonetheless, it doesn't do justice to propagating understanding if it's incomplete!  :-{

it would keep the market from falling through the floor. it gives people time to breathe and let the panic wear off and the dust settle.. so that people can come back to their senses, and talk to one another about what may be going on.  
it also gives those who are not at their computer at the time to go find a terminal and make a decision.

that's strange, there should be a lot of liquidity for buy orders if the price just crashed....

All financial models, and all portfolios combinations for all insurance companies, corporate cash savings, pension funds, sovereign funds, and basically any other wealth allocation strategy bases it's risk management and risk analysis models on this premise (the united states treasury note is the safest investment in the world. it is considered as a matter of fact to have the lowest risk of default). If we default, and the credit rating diminishes, the justification for massive treasury holdings for all of those organizations of capital mentioned earlier is suddenly moot, and they will adjust their holdings accordingly. 
"Adjusting holdings accordingly" means that they will start to sell their holdings in the Treasury. 
As will the justification for a US dollar denominated world-currency exchange.
If one or Both of these scenarios were to occur,  it's a BIIIG deal.
I have my theories as to what will happen, and am planning a few long term trades around such a scenario, but I have no idea how all of this is going to play out if the bond market starts to sell off in a big way.
Things will change. I don't know if they will get better or worse for us average joes, but I am quite sure that we will experience a drastic change.
As a currency trader, who has lived and breathed the stuff for over five years, these beez mai two cents.
