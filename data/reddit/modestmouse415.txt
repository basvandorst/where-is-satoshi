By not investing more than I can afford to lose, I’ve **always** been in fuck it mode.

I have no idea what the composition of the market cap is. It’s all speculation really, but still definitely important to consider and watch out for. 
The automated, regularly scheduled large BTC buys could be big players DCA’ing up until the futures trading opens up.

What kind of comment is this? OP’s brother died and you’re calling him a dumbass. What’s wrong with you?

Stay safe out there people. Looks like we broke the parabolic trend:  ��

What do you think Wall Street is planning on doing with the futures market? If I was a big boy on Wall Street I’d be buying as many BTC as I could right now, simultaneously setting up a short on futures. If I was a big enough whale, I would then dump my BTC hopefully creating panic in us commoners and watch the profits from my short position on futures roll in. 
Admittedly a conspiracy, but think about it for a bit. Could this be the greatest short opportunity they’ve seen lately? Possibly.

Segregated Witness. Off-chain scaling to improve transaction times. Bitcoin cash claims to be the bitcoin so they say Segwit isn’t for bitcoin. Bitcoin cash’s philosophy is on-chain scaling ala bigger block size.

+1. I’m curious to see how shorting futures could affect the price of actual BTC

This. The next month could get really ugly.

Complete denial may already be here. We got noobs in here shouting $15k by Christmas and people asking how they set price alerts. The normies are here and the denial is already strong.

you have really cool parents. I've tried to inform mine of blockchain and Bitcoin but they just aren't interested in it.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:31:25
Bitcoin is splitting into 2 separate chains. One could survive, one could die, they both could survive. It's up in the air. Prepare for chaos. I am.

Are you aware of the 2 upcoming forks? Completely oblivious?
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:27:02
I don’t understand this. Why are so many people against the second largest crypto asset? Why is it a binary “1 only” mindset? This other projects are GOOD for the crypto space in general. This isn’t a competition. Think of it like the traditional “tech industry.” Assuming you had the money, would you ONLY invest in Apple? Seems risky and ignorant in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:18:16
Wouldn’t this require vast numbers of people downloading / running malicious software? Maybe it’s naive to think this wouldn’t happen, but I have more faith in people than that... 
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:35:35
And fork again? See this is where ETH has BTC by the balls. These use cases that “smart men” will port to BTC will be A) contentious and B) slow to implement because of A. ETH you just simply write a dApp on top of. Far more developers I. ETH. 
Honest question: how does bitcoin plan to handle smart contracts? I don’t understand this. 
Bitcoin however seems like an incredible store of value and useful currency. I believe it will succeed for these reasons. ETH will succeed for other reasons.
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:31:05
How is it centralized? Just because there isn’t fighting and argument / contention doesn’t mean just a few people are determining what gets shipped. 
I’ll look into rootstock. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:08:32
That’s... not very smart. Not hating on BTC — It’s the future. But there are other projects that can coexist with BTC that are extremely interesting (ETH).

I just looked up rootstock. Seems interesting. Especially that it’s backwards compatible with Ethereum. Smart move. However when are they planning on releasing anything? Seems like Ethereum is light years ahead of rootstock.
