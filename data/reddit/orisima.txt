Ok I figured something out the bitcoin wallet app I use does not show the amount of zeros in front of my amount so i presumed that I had 0.73 but in fact I have mbtc 0.73 which is 0.00072712

I live in north America and in the central area of it. Just trying to find out what good websites that are best to sell. I tried Local bitcoin but it's not wanting to let me get my bitcoins there.

If I was a troll I would have been a lot more forward with asking for bitcoins and would have acted a lot more stupid. The real troll is you man, other then calling people out and saying there worthless even before they start why not help them start with basic info like saying "hey other then selling save up first and then sell when you have x.xx bitcoins" That would make you look less like a dick and more helpful. Like most people say. if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all.

I have almost one bitcoin in a wallet and no I will continue regardless of what you say, so why not instead of insulting people and just go back in your corner and collect your shit and sell it for bitcoins. Next time you reply try to be more considerate then just shitposting on someone.
