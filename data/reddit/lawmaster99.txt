Even if LN does come in 1-2 months... LN is designed to thrive on network effects. It's very very unlikely that even if it was ready for mass adoption today, it would be used by the majority of BTC users in 1-2 months
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:29:25
This whole post is very wrong and it should be downvoted. Microsoft previously allowed to fund an account with Bitcoin and they removed that option today.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:02:17
How so? Bitcoin became unusable for payments with no immediate fix in sight and large merchants like Microsoft and Steam are backing out. That's not big?
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:39:45
And why do you think Bitcoin is a good store of value? In fact, something as volatile as Bitcoin right now cannot be a reliable store of value. The value is currently derived from speculation and people that buy for higher prices than you bought. Think about it and give me one argument why BTC is a good store of value.
In my eyes, it's network effect and scarcity. Both of these can be eliminated when people quit in bunches.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:06:19
So you want to wait until an official statement from MSFT assuming they even make one? For all we know, they could have just ended their relationship with a payment processor. 
I verified it myself and asked many friends to verify also. The truth is that BTC payments are not available now and it's been over 24 hours, which means it's extremely unlikely that it's just a temporary bug or downtime.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:30:14
It is not now. But it has potential to become one. However, I agree with you that Bitcoin is currently just a speculative greed machine. People are making money because other people are buying for higher prices. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 06:55:24
Yea! Because price increases of 1600% are totally good for Bitcoin, right? You guys need to realize that this kind of volatility (either negative or positive) is what is ultimately hurting Bitcoin right now. You want higher prices, which means you want higher adoption from people right? 
The problem is that with higher adoption, more people join and the network gets clogged even more. Now, the mempool is at 180k transactions. Can you imagine what would happen if so many new users joined this year? Bitcoin needs time to stabilize and solve its scalability issues before that happens. Otherwise, it's going to keep losing its dominance to altcoins.
Of course, someone will come in and say that LN is here but the truth is that it's not. And it most likely won't help to relieve the network congestion anytime soon. The same was said about Segwit and adoption is still really small (11% right now). What makes you think that all these exchanges/wallets and new users will adopt LN as soon as it becomes feasible?
It's time to stop focusing on the stupid lambo and price memes and focus on actually helping Bitcoin to be usable again. Now, everyone is just banking that people will keep buying at higher prices so you can make money on your BTC that you bought for cheaper.
Let's solve the issues first and focus on the memes later. This mentality and greed just hurts BTC
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:42:24
I believe this is wishful thinking. But we shall see :) I think BTC is losing its dominance because it doesn't function for what it was intended. To bank the unbanked. To disenfranchise the central banks. And other coins are coming and taking Bitcoin's market cap. The store of value argument is questionable at best. As soon as speculators stop believing that it can keep going up, they will start cashing out. The question is when not if. Can LN actually help before this all happens? Maybe but not likely
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:25:56
What happened to disenfranchising central banks and banking the unbanked?
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:48:13
The stickied post is wrong. Read the edits
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:27:27
I agree 100%. Putting all of their eggs in one basket is and should be considered a big no-no for BTC. I think their ego is in the way of increasing the blocksize now. Just look at Luke Dashjr's twitter. He actually argues for shrinking the blocksize
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:30:14
How does Bitcoin create its value then? Can anything as volatile as Bitcoin even be considered a store of value?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:06:19
Not right now but there are also considerable less transactions in BCH. If it had as many transactions as BTC, it would handle it better but it would also struggle
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:14:10
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:48:35
Man, you're wrong
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:13:46
It's not supposed to be that way
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:12:45
So it's fake news automatically because Microsoft hasn't confirmed it yet? What's the proof? The mod interpreted the article wrong and tried to argue that Microsoft just switched the way they accept payments in BTC. Which is true because the article stated that's the way it was before and NOT now.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:05:33
Yes. This is all a big conspiracy! Microsoft is scared shitless of Bitcoin so it is manipulating it by not accepting it anymore. Yup
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:11:26
Yes and that is precisely what I am saying. If price starts dropping, speculators with weak hands will sell and leave to chase other alts. And trust me, there is a lot of speculators just looking to ride the Bitcoin wave for the gains. When the price inevitably drops, security drops too. Sure, Bitcoin is one of the most, if not most, decentralized crypto. But I believe that what should also be considered is centralization of users. With high fees, only people that are holding more BTC get to use it. It eliminates the poor 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:23:27
Downvoting the news won't help. Don't downvote stuff that doesn't fit your agenda. This is big news for Bitcoin either way
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:05:00
That's a good question and a very hard one to answer. One is a drastic measure that could partially help the network in the short term. The second one is a waiting game and hoping that LN will work. In my eyes, it was a lose lose situation 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:44:56
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:43:14
That plus the option actually not being present anymore. Yesterday you could pay with BTC on Microsoft. Today you can't. It's been now more than 24 hours and it's still not there. This post has been live for more than 6 hours and MSFT didn't dispute it. Is that not enough? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:43:52
Exactly what I am thinking
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:22:48
We need something. The train is leaving now
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:31:31
This is very very true. And not enough people are talking about this
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:22:05
Normally I get sarcasm but I can easily see someone actually saying this here with all seriousness. Sorry!
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:17:36
Yes, I am aware. Not saying it would eliminate it but it would effectively make it drop to sub $1000 levels at least
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:55:31
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:50:19
So why market it as opt-in then?
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:42:51
Agree to disagree. It was most likely a PR move anyway
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:49:26
Bitcoin is far away from a ponzi scheme. It still has some use cases where it performs very good. And as long as it gets its previous ability as medium of exchange, it will go back to being useful.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:13:49
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:23:44
Yep. But the fact that Microsoft is not accepting BTC anymore is true. You can check yourself
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:00:41
This is the way it should work. But you are, unfortunately, a minority
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:01:47
Keep thinking that if it will make you sleep better
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:13:54
It was not cheap/fast transactions. It was cheap/fast transactions combined with decentralized, secure and untouchable by the government. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:39:46
You are assuming that Bitcoin can ever function as a store of value, which is questionable at best. Where does Bitcoin currently get its value? Why has it grown by almost 2000% since January if usability is down and maybe 1% people use Bitcoin for actually sending transactions while the rest just speculates on price
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:02:49
No, happened yesterday. Your source?
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:25:30
It's all good :) Good on you on owning up to making a mistake.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:36:29
It's most likely a combination of volatility and fees. But hard to tell. Even if it was the fact that not many people were using it to pay, it's still a problem. Read this thread: 
It was big news when they started using it but it's not big news when they stopped?
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:39:04
You are being fooled by this post. The news is correct
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:05:35
Sure but high volatility affects the amount of people that will pay with BTC. As do fees
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:40:58
Source? This is wishful thinking IMO. It's a combination of high fees, high volatility and not enough use
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:32:32
It's been going on for more than a day and there is also no official statement disputing that they stopped. Highly unlikely that this is a temporary bug
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:12:23
And then increase the blocksize after the LN is adopted by enough people? Because even the LN whitepaper states that it needs way more than 1MB to function properly
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:49:46
Yea, exactly. It's the network effect that's currently generating the value. When speculators change their sentiment, this whole sub is in for a big surprise.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:41:16
Doesn't matter. They don't even have that now. Who, other than Overstock, accepts Bitcoin directly? I will wait
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:45:56
Belive in the idea. I am the furthest thing away from worshipping Bitcoin as a religion. Stop twisting my words
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:23:55
I also think a major correction is coming. However, with many institutional investors (hedge funds, investment banks) entering, it's really hard to estimate. They have big money in BTC
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:02:15
That's not how it works. Assets can't function as a store of value without an underlying usability, which Bitcoin doesn't have right now
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:07:52
No, it's an opt-in protocol. No one has to do anything because it's built on top of Bitcoin. LN relies on a lot of people using it to create connections for transactions to route through. It's quite a complicated topic but read some arguments here: 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:18:14
I have been and this is big news for me and judging by the fact that this is already on the front page, I am willing to bet that more people think so as well
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:38:34
They are citing something that was said in chat by their tech support. Hard to say if it's reliable. But could be true
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:21:08
Agreed. And it will take a major bear run to clean this space, which will ultimately help BTC
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:54:34
How is this news false? The mod is wrong. Post a proof
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:59:21
Since December of 2014
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:33:42
This whole thing is hypothetical. We don't know how it's going to turn out. We don't know if LN will work and be adopted. We don't know when schnorr signatures will arrive. We don't know anything
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:06:04
Hence "Microsoft joins Steam and stops accepting Bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:43:02
That was one of the biggest selling points of adopting Segwit, which didn't even have consensus at first. That it would be opt-in. I don't get the community's outrage over the fact that an opt-in feature is not being implemented enough.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:08:11
This article states that it STOPPED accepting Bitcoin today
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:58:25
I partially agree but I don't think you can force network participants to adopt a technology that's marketed as opt-in. You can pressure them but the truth is that they are profiting on people that don't know much about BTC and don't follow the news as much
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:44:07
I feel the same way. The selfdestruction is starting
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:58:37
"This indicates that the story, while very poorly written, may indeed be true." 
It's not inclusive but the mod could have done his own research before posting a clearly wrong comment that he stickied and labeled the post as "misleading". Come on man
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:20:35
What if BTC loses its dominance until that happens and some alt overtakes it? Even if LN works the way it's promised, that alt can just implement LN as well as it's an open source protocol.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:55:44
I fully agree
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:28:02
Yes, this post is so wrong... Apparently questioning Bitcoin means shilling now
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:44:54
Go ahead. It's a better reason
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:56:54
It showed confidence in Bitcoin from Microsoft. That's why it was big news
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:39:59
Not a copypasta
@_date: 2017-05-11 12:14:05
Good explanation! One thing that I would add is that it Bitcoin's volatility will likely never reach fiat levels exactly because Bitcoin does not have an institution that would macroeconomically stabilize the exchange rate. However, the volatility levels of Bitcoin will surely approach fiat in the next 3-5 years.
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:54:39
If Bitcoin were to follow the same volatility trends as it did in the past 7 years, the volatility would reach levels that are comparable to established fiat currencies. You can see the forecast in [this graph]( However, the paper also states that it is unlikely that Bitcoin will reduce at the same rate since it does have the ability to make macroeconomic adjustments to stabilize the exchange rate (there is no central bank).
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:34:56
The paper estimates that it would reach fiat levels in 2019-2020 if volatility follows the same trend as in the past 7 years. [This is the graph]( that is attached in the paper. The paper also acknowledges that it is improbable that the volatility will continue to reduce at the current rate because of the absence of central banks and their ability to make macroeconomic adjustments to stabilize the exchange rate. However, we are closer than people think.
