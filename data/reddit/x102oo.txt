No matter what goal you set, historically it would probably be too low when it comes to this space. This probably plays out one more time, regular investors leaving the market when the next bear market hits.  I don't think most early investors even thought about investing in traditional sense. They are very ideological people. Most of them seem to live rather normal life with a lot of bitcoin.

I don't now, but I do know living in a very small 1st world country that the demand for hard currency like USD has always been there, because small currencies tend to be shitty. 
 I imagine this being even stronger in 3rd world countries, even if they had access to banking, due to unstable governments and bad monetary policy. Not to mention people who use things like mobile talk time as money and store of value, because its the best they got. Also it would allow 1st world people/companies to transact directly with 3rd world, this would assist in integrating them in the global economy, which would benefit everybody economically. 
I think bitcoin will have real value there, but the volatility needs to settle down and it is far from ready to do that.

Its just a way of never exposing your private key on to the internet, at least not before you want to spend the coins.
In theory you can create bitcoin "wallet" (meaning public and private key) with pen and paper, and it works. This would be the most raw paper wallet, but normally you just create them in offline computer because its easier. You can send coins there and those will be accessible with the private key only you hold. 
Connection to the network is required only when you send coins, and even then you dont have to expose your private keys if you use offline signing which many wallets support. 
Maybe this helps to get the concept. Its really about the keys and keeping them off the internet so nobody else is not able to use them even in theory.

Bought in about $2, 185 bitcoins, sold them all well before $10, so dont worry. It has never been easy to hodl. I can almost guarantee there arent many large bagholders left from those earlier years. Which is good because they would be crashing the market all the time when dumping.

The main problem is the fee market itself. If people want to pay a lot, everybody pays a lot an only the sky is the limit in theory (because of the competition) even if there was just 1 transaction in the mempool that doesnt fit in the block.
It requires everybody making deal with everybody to pay only certain amount to not artificially bloat the fees. I doubts if its possible to solve by algorithms. There needs to be other channels for payments so that the competition in the fee market doesnt get out of control.
Electrum offers custom fees btw.

Blockchain is basically just an excel spreadsheet, everybody has the copy of the same sheet but can only take coins from their own slots and credit somebody else's slot. The sheet is also updated real time so everyone sees changes all the time. 
Mining is solving puzzle to release new coins and crediting them to a slot of your own control. Its really simple, only if you want to know how it actually works you need some serious studying but this is basically it and it works and thats why everybody talks about it.

Your store of value would be just as reliable with 2 MB blocks which is what the current mess is about. In addition it would enable more people to transact in the chain cheaper.

This has nothing to do with this debate. Bitcoin is secured with electric power and those who have access to cheap power can "secure" or "control" bitcoin better than others and that is a plain fact. China has a policy and resources to encourage cheap electricity, totally unrelated to bitcoin.
Unless you switch to POS miners in China will have an edge in the mining business and more control over bitcoin and whatever they choose to mine. Block size makes no difference. Bitcoin is not about West vs. China its about making nation states less relevant altogether.

Actually I meant avoid sending bitcoins bit by bit if there is a possibility to send them in larger chunks, because its possible that bitcoin fees keep rising and in the future it will become even more expensive to move them further.
For example mining profits used to be payed out bit by bit from the pools, now if somebody has and old wallet where this was done its going to be quite expensive to move them, not to mention about future. 
Sending small value through bitcoin blockchain is pointless already and maybe remains so.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:44:44

$300 000 isnt really a problem, the liquidity is much more meaning there are quite a lot of buy orders of bitcoins at different prices. But yeah, if you unload $300million at once it will be a problem and will crash the market for sure. Obviously you dont want to dump that since you are going to have to sell some bitcoins at very low prices (people can still have market orders set for $50 per bitcoin for example and hope they catch something with it)
ETH had a flash crash some weeks ago where the price went down to less than $1 for a second or so and some people got cheap coins. This would happen due to large market order being filled.
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:42:49

Thats the point, you cant understand if you are rational person looking this from outside. No new person I know who recently got into bitcoin understand why this is such a black flag for many. There are people that just dont want to hard fork bitcoin no matter what and rather deal with the busy blockchain. 
IMO these are just little bit too conservative as 1MB is an arbitrary number that could just as well be 2 and it makes no difference except it scales a bit further, and just a bit. Its absolutely useless to split bitcoin into many projects because of this issue, and if something is an attack is that this will divide the community over and over again until it fights itself do death.

The fact that this is upvoted in the most bullish subreddit suggests that the bubble has still way to go. When complete denial sets in then its close.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:06:41
Serious, but actually Im fairly confident reading the replies there is strong denial that it is impossible for bitcoin to crash for more than 60% or so. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:33:08
Lol, not.
@_date: 2018-11-15 19:06:36


Well, that's not what happened because that's not how it works. By printing currency you don't automatically lower the purchasing power by same amount. Money velocity has gone in the other direction which has balanced that, so the average Joe hasn't lost much purchasing power at all.
But the world is going to a mess mainly because of debt. How that is going to play out is anybody's guess. Hyperinflation is one way to cure it. There is no good way. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 08:38:24
Yes. Hyperinflation is a wealth transfer from those who hold the currency / are creditors in that currency, to those who don't don't hold currency and instead hold something else, or who are debtors in that currency.
Hyperinflation kind of feeds itself because everybody is willing to exchange the currency for anything else for almost any price. That's why its hard to stop.

Is this 3M Novec fluid?

Interesting, been thinking about the same.
Did you do it just for the heck of it or is there some other advantage? Takes much less space? What is the size of the room this setup is in?
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:54:09
Not a bit. Decline is very fast, which means bottom comes soon. 
And there is no systemic crisis like in 2013. Its just wealth transfer.

You are making rational arguments in a middle of a mania here.. It is quite worthless in a middle of a bubble but in other times it might be more useful. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:27:23
We must be near the bottom..
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:33:41
Less than 10%, down from 70% couple weeks ago. I think bear market is imminent. Hodled through the 2013 bubble all the way to 2017 and learned something from the process.

And it was, just like it has been 5 times before. Every time there is a thought that this one must real, but it isnt. And it will not be hardly last bubble either.

Lol. It is only healthy to wipe out FOMOers money every now and then, fact is over long term it does not wipe out money, quite the opposite.

Look at 2013-2014 charts, there is always a big bounce before the final bear slide.. unfortunately unless china reverses its decision it aint going back anytime soon
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:17:58
Nope, but there would be demand for such since these posts appear quite often. You would just have to collect these people somewhere and then moderate it. Not very easy I guess.

The easiest and quite secure way to store them is to go to 
Once you generated the wallet click "print" and make sure it prints the page as it is shown. The left part below "SHARE" is your bitcoin address where you send the coins to. Copy this string somewhere in your computer or elsewhere for easier access, so its not just on paper. You can send coins over and over to this address.  allows you to check the balance of the address by just copying it to to the "search" field.
The right part "SECRET" is the part which allows you or someone else to later use the bitcoins, so keep the paper safe. This part should only be on paper.

Its just some technical analyst employed by Goldman Sachs, they could employ astrologists it makes no difference.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:58:18
Because its probably not going to happen because timing is damn difficult. Predicting bear pattern in my opinion is even harder than the tops.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:37:31
Great story, like the good old times until this sub became memefest.
However I think you are overvaluing gold, new generations do not appreciate physical things any more.

Looking forward for the bear market, long bull markets tend to be very stressful too as a holder. There will be many more cycles in bitcoin, thats almost certain. This one probably is not quite over yet but these times create enormous interest and investments in bitcoin and during bear markets the real work is done, which ultimately creates the infrastructure needed for the future bull markets.

What about bitcoin being currently in hyperinflation?

Based on the responses "we" has changed quite a bit. This is the mindset of pre-2014, bitcoin has grown old now. And it's a lot less anarchistic.

think you got wrong numbers there.
IMO should be (current numbers):
Probability of success on a single trial: .807
Number of trials: 81
Number of successes (x): 65
Gives 60% chance

Next big uncertainty point may be the potential segwit2x fork couple months from now so if that gets bad you might see sub 2000

Flash crashes can happen with the stop-loss bots and all. Ethereum just had one when it dropped about 99% for a second before recovering.

for years, it was a miracle it functioned such a long time when everybody knew there was something shady about it.

Best entry point is when it has crashed 10% or more and youll see a a lot of "should i move to fiat for the time being" -kind of posts. Maybe not exactly this moment.
