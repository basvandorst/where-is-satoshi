If you read this Patrick, good job on being an early adopter of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology, as a business owner using Bitcoin to power our Casino it gives us more belief we made the right choice to use the internet of money!

Sad the only attention Casino's get is when it's negative here. Many are just running a legitimate business like any other in the Bitcoin space.

If anyone has any questions beyond the ones already asked, just let us  know.

Correct, just keep in mind that it takes an average of those 1000 bets to calculate the max bet you can make during your fully forged 20 bets.

Fantastic, it is a huge benefit to Bitcoin to have people like yourself educating the public on it's benefits and uses, best of luck!

We are sorry to hear this Theymos, hopefully nothing too terrible comes of this. The Gambling subforum is a great place for detailed information on our business. While other forums are nice, obviously your site has the largest concentration of players. We wish you well as you sort this out.

The world does not yet understand what it is like to be their own bank, large credit companies will do anything to stop them from becoming informed. All any of us can do in the Bitcoin community is keep telling people about the freedom of controlling your own funds.

HTML5 canvas animation, thank you for your interest!

Hello, do you mean for our countdown or from what you see in our screenshots of the actual site?
@_date: 2015-08-01 01:05:06
I needed that laugh right now thank you sir!

Good luck everyone!

He thought we didn't need him, but in fact we do so everyone doesn't ruin his work. If they centralize Bitcoin you may as well be the figurehead you refused to become.
Satoshi Nakamoto where are you?

Just had a player named magicaltux at our casino probably a coincidence though.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:35:26
No we are a legitimate business but that was pretty good :)
@_date: 2015-07-31 02:24:23
Should be a great time, win or lose players will win if they hit VIP levels.
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:57:17
We are also releasing a 10% affiliate code for all players that will be stack-able with the CashBack club giving people the ability to earn 30% back. This feature should launch later today.

For more details you can see these on social media and our thread on bitcointalk: 
@_date: 2015-08-01 23:47:10
15% referral bonus, link is found in your account page. Payouts for that and Cashback club are sent to your Moneypot secure account wallet every Sunday. Currently our site is undergoing maintenance should be up in the next 24 hours.

In our Casino volume is the most important so I believe you are quite right, there are many parallels :) 
We want to see some big winners for this one.
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:33:50
Thank you for putting this up but don't bother, if it's not a funny picture, blocksize debate, or some random company accepting bitcoin on Mt. Everest then it just gets down voted into oblivion.
I appreciate the gesture though.

For more details or questions see our thread on Bitcointalk, good luck everyone!

Very nice contribution to Bitcoin and for new people especially. Upvoted!

Bitcointalk announcement here: 
@_date: 2015-09-18 18:54:34
Nice to see this hit the front page, while everyone is building on Bitcoin technology our casino and others are trying to bring some entertainment value to it's users.
@_date: 2015-10-01 15:57:03
Accumulation phase, though long has been occurring. To the moon is going to take on a new meaning with the next bubble,  a site that is actively bringing Bitcoin entertainment to the masses. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 14:32:34
This contest is a new way for friendly competition between sites and Bitcoin wagering volumes determines the winner. If you are a volume maker then either site is offering great bonuses, good luck!
