Apple pay is an interface for credit cards payments.
Bitcoin is a technology for value transfer.
I see both as very different things. 
Apple could one day improve the technology: skip credit cards and cut deals directly with the bank. They could reduce double fees when some merchant receiving with apple pay also bought something from another merchant using apple pay, charging no fees when the money didn't leave apple's system. 
Bitcoin companies should improve the interface: quit using qrcodes for everything, create faster wallets, better hardware-software integration and make things more transparent for the end user.

Two main ways are possible: 
1) they are exchange specific vouchers, so now coinbase instead if being a full exchange would simply buy and sell coinbase dollars. This requires trust that the exchange will still exist in the future. So if you had a bunch of mtGox dollars you would certainly lose money but you'd still be holding the tokens and could try to sell them for anyone willing to take the risk. 
2) contract for difference. A bunch of people throw money into the same pile, either betting that bitcoin will gain value or people believing it will lose and wanting to keep their investments stable. If bitcoin falls, the money from the bulls will cover the bears losses, but if the value increases then bulls wil multiply their gains by keeping the bears profits. 
3) futures and other similar financial instruments.

Have you learned nothing people? Yes, it seems that they got the user experience right, but judging from the videos it seems that circle acts like a bank, by keeping your bitcoins with them. So:
* any bitcoin  you put there belongs to them, and they promise to give it back to you. 
* if circle goes under, like neo&amp;bees your money is gone and you'll have to go with the usual legal routes to try to get any of it back. Your money is gone. 
* if they want to lock an account, or if a government orders them to seize your assets, then your money is gone
* if thy decide not to do business with some entity they can also hold those funds. 
* they have no cryptographic proof of their Bitcoin holdings. They can be running (and probably are) as a fractional reserve and if anything happens on the inside, your money is gone. 
In short, the only way in which they are different from paypal or an online bank, is that they are investing part of your funds on bitcoins for you. You are protected not by math, but by the Usual regulations concerning money, trust them as much as you trust the us government. 
Don't say you were not warned.

Yes, but if it's based on a contract then there can be no breach of trust: the contract holds your bitcoin for you while you use ethereum and as soon as you want to release it, it becomes bitcoin again.
Ethereum doesn't want to replace bitcoin, it wants to enhance it. The fact that it's in a different blockchain probably is better for bitcoin also, as it keeps it easier to prune it's giant size if the blockchain isn't carrying all other apps weight..

You know, fungibility will never really be a problem. If someone releases software that allows blacklists, if it became popular and if it wasn't possible to technically evade it, then probably the people doing the blacklisting would be among the first ones blacklisted. And if it somehow became popular then people would simply exchange clean coins for dirty ones - maybe at a fee.
I could imagine a future where all this trading would become automatic, and everyone would fall under someone's else blacklist, based on political, religious or moral views. In the end you'd be paying a "unlikeable tax" that would be proportional to (1) how many people cared about your service and (2) how unlikeable whatever you were doing was seen by those people.

I see your point but still I'm not sure how feasible that is. I don't know a single developer who doesn't have an answer to the question: "if money was not an issue what project would you work on?". Everyone has tier passion, for some is to build a game, an app, a site or a new bitcoin based technology, things that could actually be profitable if he could quit his day job and work only on that for a whole year. But in reality they can't, specially if they're smart people who can get a well paying job. 
The private IPO model that ethereum and master protocol uses are better alternative to the current model of raising money with only a few rich angel investors, it's more like a kickstarter and much like it investors need to know the project might never work or be as great as it seemed. 
Of course if it fails the founder shouldn't be able to walk away with a million dollars, but IMHO the best way to achieve those fair rewards is build them into an open transparent decentralized organization: which is exactly the kind of technology those guys are building.

It's important to note that even if the mike Hearn table proved that chances that Dorian was nakamoto were 90/100 that wouldn't mean that the chands nakamoto were Dorian would be 90/100!
It's the same statistic fallacy in which a 90% confidence test can be wrong 99% of the time. Suppose we run the same test with all the people who ever participated in a cryptography mailing list, who published anything into p2p research, cyberpunk bloggers, reddit and 4chan users etc. How many of them would be proficient in English, use MB instead of Meg, use idioms like AFAIK and have holes in their professional history that weren't accounted for? I don't know, maybe tens of thousands? Suppose we filter most of those and end up with a thousand top candidates, all of them who scored 10/10 out of the test "could possibly ahe created bitcoin". 
If we assume there's only one Satoshi Nakamoto (it's not a team), then of those candidates, the chances of any single one not being the real satoshi is 99.9%..
This is the Newsweek blunder: they were trying to find the best candidate from a biased pool (all Americans called satoshi) which is a statistical and scientific error.

This isn't regulation's fault, this is the implementation's fault. 
Why isn't this as easy as using your credit card? Because with your credit card, they signup you before you can come up to the machine! If laws require robocoin to keep information on everyone who uses it to dispense cash, then they could have used a preregistration using your smartphone: you set up, give the same information the machine is asking, but from your phone, comfortably, when you want. When you want to sell your coins, you could approach your phone to the machine, it would detect it via bluetooth/nfc, send a message to confirm with your phone and you should be able to cash out.
I don't see why the other way around, to buy bitcoins, you couldn't simply buy it with cash, just like you can buy a Best Buy gift card or Farmville credits. If those are legal, a bitcoin gift card should be too..

I understand your point but I believe there's a huge discrepancy between Ross' family defense and this community attitude. Their defense is "Ross is such a nice guy he could never have done it", while your defense is "there's nothing wrong with what he did, because the existing laws are actually going against the public interest". Ross can't have it both ways and this actually hurts his position, after all this is a trial to argue if he broke the law, not about either the law is wrong. 
Unless, of course, the family considers it a lost case and want simply to reduce his sentencing and recoup legal fees, or that the lawyers are going for some sort of public pardon/jury nullification but I don't understand the American legal system enough to know if that's plausible.

There are two things that you can understand as "network": 
1) the literal network of computers running the software. That's true, but does it matter? Miners are attracted to useful (profitable) networks, they don't create usefulness. As long as ethereum has enough miners to e secure, then it's okay. It can even share the network since most bitcoin miners today are ASICs anyway, so it's an opportunity for other computers to mine. 
2) "network effect", which supposed that people who have bitcoin are more likely to use technologies in the bitcoin blockchain. I disagree, first because there will certainly be many bridges that will make the transition Eth-BTC simple enough so bitcoin holders will only need to buy ether as needed for their computation needs and convert back the change. Secondly, there are many more people who don't have either, so out goal is really make it easy for anyone to use it, even of they don't hold any crypto.

It's not actually premined since it's a number created by them, they were never mined they just exist before the minng even starts. 
The way they value is arbitrary: the value is fixed, there's no initial cap, and the amount raised in the fundraiser will affect how many coins will be created in the future. So in a sense instead of allowing the market to determine the price, they're making the market determine the number of currency available.

Just a clarification: just because ethereum runs in it's own blockchain for technical reasons, there's no reason it will only be used with ether.

While I agree with him with coins that are mere bitcoin clones, I can't agree with him about Ethereum or Master protocol.
In fact, the author contradicts himself when he disses ethereum but praises Namecoin.
The argument is: smart contracts are not useful if ether isn't valuable. I think it's the cause effect is the opposite: the value of ether comes from the value of smart contracts.
If you believe Namecoin or Bitmessage is useful, then a protocol that allows you to build services like those is also useful. Sure, if ether isn't liquid a smart contract that gives you ether if your crop plantation fails isn't very useful, but there are other services that can be build on top that benefit from a decentralized programatical consensus, and those will give value to ether which will in turn give value to the crop contract.

But these servers instead of just running bitcoin they can run any program. So imagine you build a nice bot that does some service and makes some money. Instead of managing the servers and etc, the bot simply finds the best deal for his memory and CPU usage to the decentralized network and then pays you the fee. In theory you could release a bot anonymously that would work outside of your control in such a way that it multiplies and evolves by itself as it finds niches and neither you or any government could stop it, I will go on as long as it can make money enough o pay for its existence.

You could argue that of your bitcoin is held in an exchange account then you for actually own any bitcoin, you hold an IOU for a bitcoin in that exchange. 
This sort of thing comes up when trying to come up with how many dollars are out there: if you have some dollars in a bank, but this bank lends some of those dollars around, and you have a mortgage you're still paying that you owe to another bank who also in turn lends most of its money, how do you sum everything up?

Counterparty and Ethereum are two groups trying to enhance bitcoin in different manners. Counterparty tries to add more features (like custom assets) to the bitcoin blockchain, while piggybacking on it, ethereum wants to build an app platform that uses it's own blockchain where you can build any feature you want.
Yesterday the counterparty team took a part of Ethereum's open source code and ported it to their platform. Their point was that smart contracts could be just a new "feature" inside counterparty. 
Today the Ethereum Founder rewrote the main counterparty asset feature in an ethereum language. His point is that custom assets could be just an app inside ethereum.

People are acting out as if Apple Pay is a direct competitor, it's not, they're in different leagues. Apple Pay is a killer user experience for payments. It has nothing to do with actual credit cards or banks except that apple uses them as intermediary. In theory Apple could ignore credit card companies and cut deals directly with banks or apple could be itself a bank. They'll integrate bitcoin only if it's a well established technology that already helps consumers, because they start at user experience and then try to find a solution.
Bitcoin wallets could take many hints in UX from Apple..

Do it in such a way that in order to the money to be moved, you would have to go to at least two different places or if you are not available that at least 2 or 3 trusted family members would have to come together.
* Test everything to be sure it works and when you feel confortable, move whatever value you don't want to touch for the next few years or more into the wallet

What you're proposing is to create an alternative currency that keeps the bitcoin history until a given date, it would not be bitcoin. Since this would make most ASIC miners obsolete, none of them would switch so you'd have a hard time getting that "network power" you're talking about. 
Creating a new blockchain is exactly what ethereum is doing, with the only difference is that ether will start without bitcoin's multiple gigabytes of data, which I believe is a good choice. Instead there are some people building tools that will allow ethereum contracts to query the state of any bitcoin address inside the ethereum network, so this data you are talking about is acessible.

Ethereun is  bitcoin that runs code instead of having a currency. Imagine a software that has these characteristics:
1) it's not controlled by any central computer and can't be shut down. 
2) it pays for the resources it uses. 
3) it can send and receive money around to pay for collaborators or even other software. 
This means that most organizations could be transformed into code: who is paid salary and benefits, who gets a promotion, who gets product shipped, how to contract new people, how to improve and update the organization, etc. This potentially could do to companies and many legal systems what bitcoin wants to do to money.

So in short, mtgox was probably buying bitcoins withou any real money, creating a sort of Ponzi scheme. There are two way forwards, the way I see it. 
1) we what we've always used, trust that more regulation will prevent bad actors, trust that investigators will investigate fraud,  that a fair justice system will punish mt gox enough that the next fraudster might think twice before going forward. 
2) we stop trusting any companies who do used open and decentralized systems. If the company doesn't publish a cryptographic proof of balance, assume they are running a fractional reserve banking (at best, or a Ponzi scheme at worse); if a company isn't issuing blockchain assets for you to trade, assume its trading engine will break down; if you are not holding the private key to your bitcoin, assume you don't have any and the company won't pay you their IOUs. 
The reason bitcoin exists is because some people didn't  trust the previous financial tools of the system. We won't assume they're fixed until we've rewritten them.

The problem with ideological fight is that it oversees the big picture.

So I've seen people dismiss bitcoin not because of the technology but because they don't want States to end.

Colored coins are smart property stored in the bitcoin blockchain. The advantages of storing it there is that if you are buying something valuable enough to warrant a smart property, you want it protected from double spending attacks.
Yes, many people feel that this isn't a good use of blockchain space, so there are multiple other ways to achieve the goal. For now it's a dispute between Mastercoin, coloured coins, ethereum and counterparts, everyone trying to do similar things in a completely different manner. You vote which one you prefer by using it.
But in the end, colored coins are only as good as whatever smart property they track. Buying "blue coins" just because they are coloured is completely meaningless. It's like charging for a blank piece of paper that you can print a car sale contract.

I'm saying you can't build a system that expects people will simply do the right thing because it's unstable. A robust system is one where the behavior you need from the majority is the one most profitable from the individual. 


You're describing the outcome. In the case of bitcoin it's "we need to make system changes so the hashing  power is as decentralized as possible". 
The question is how. To say "Bitcoin miners should leave this pool" is as fruitless, in my opinion as saying "the wealthy should give their money to the poor" if your desired outcome is a more equitable society. 
More equitable and stable societies aren't those were wealthy people are more generous or one where the government forcibly takes wealth away, is ones where doing good pays off.

Did silk road or overstock act as a pegged side chain to bitcoin? Those are just services in proprietary databases inside private servers. But if someone builds an overstock in Ethereum that accepts bitcoin, suddenly it has nothing to do with bitcoin just because information  happens to pass by a different blockchain?

It's different: if I rob your harddrive I don't know whats inside so I might be fooled. But in this scenario the robber doesn't know where the wallet.dat is, he only knows you have instant access to it, and therefore he can blackmail you until you come up with the amount.
The difference from the usual case is that in a movie, when a criminal kidnaps a family and asks for a million dollars, the rich guy will usually say: "ok, just give me 24 hours so I can get it for you" because his money isn't just sitting behind a phrase in his head..

The faster transaction times are a result of mostly using the ghost protocol, which was developed originally for bitcoin and adds orphan blocks, which are discarded in bitcoin, for extra security. But also, the fast computation was a requirement so we've pushed the block time down as much as we could and added a lot of support for smart handling of soft forks on the app side. So if you're moving something very important you might want to wait a few minutes to be assured there won't be a regression. 
We don't want to be digital gold, bitcoin is already great at that, we want to be smart contracts, and I'd argue that those who are trying to cram those functionalities in the bitcoin blockchain are doing it at the cost of those who just want bitcoin to be cheaper, more decentralized and secure store of value. 
We are not the enemy.

I just added it as a webapp and it's the nicest looking bitcoin app I have on my iPhone! This includes blockchain, wich I feel only got approved because the reviewers didn't understand what it did.
One thing got me confused: the big QRCode at the top, is it the public address for deposits or is it the private key for importing the balance? I suppose it's the former but you could make it clearer.
My wishlist:
* You should add some way to reduce the header, specially since I already added it to passbook, I don't need it to be so big. Maybe a collapsible menu?
* Add a currency converter. It's handy to make quick calculations. Nothing too fancy, I like the app's simplicity, just easier way to send $10 dollars to someone without having to go to another app.
* Add brain wallet support. You have your main wallet but can also switch to any other that you can provide a 20 digit password for. 
* Maybe if the qrcode is actually for deposits, you could have an option to display the private key in a qr also. It would be great to print paper wallets.
* Donation button for supporting the team!

I was trying to describe proof of work to avoid double spending, but I guess I mixed up 


I don't get it: is there something special about this transaction? Did he simply send two satoshi nowhere as a homage? Because if its just that then we have to account for all the people who forgot a password for wallets or died before spending so there's a lot less coins.
Ps: is there a way to implement a cryptographical "forgot your password"? Maybe you would have to encrypt your wallet with two distinct passwords (is that even feasible?), the second one being the backup. Or maybe something as simple as keeping an encrypted text file with all your other passwords, the master password for which you kept in a safe...

Anonymity is a feature of bitcoin, but that doesn't mean everything bitcoin needs to be anonymous.

Bitcoin is an border less money transfer. People want a way to take the money they have, and teleport it to someone else pocket, independent of currency or country. This doesn't help that.

Services. 
If I was an Iranian desperate for bitcoins I would sell some of my services online in bitcoins. Not everyone can do this, but designers, programmers, writers, translators, anyone that can work online could function as a international trader bringing bitcoins to Iran. Of course he can't pay his bills with bitcoins so he would have either to set up an informal btc exchange or he could do local work in IRR enough to pay his bills and have btc as backups. 
This has many problems: not everyone can work online; freelance sites could be censored anytime in Iran; he could be jailed for tax evasion, money laundering or maybe a unrelated fake crime; he would have no way to convert the money he already has into bitcoins; etc — but those alternatives still look better than smuggling cars and smartphones.

If the buyer doesn't release the funds he won't get them back either so he has nothing to gain from it and can probably lose some sort of rating or credit (if eBay doesn't allow this buyer reputation score  it's up to the vendors to choose a site that does).

If he moves the coins out of them there's no way to know the actual balance, only how much money was transferred into it. Anyone could fake it to inflate their numbers.

BTC ATMs are a great idea but with one serious catch 22 problem. They're only useful for people using bitcoins as a currency which aren't numerous enough to justify their cost. People are thinking abut ATMs as a banking mechanism where you could withdraw and deposit on your "bitcoin bank". 
I'm just suggesting is that if instead of speaking of them as bank accounts we "sell the idea" of bitcoins as temporary money voucher for crossing a border then it can be incredibly useful with only two machines in the right location. Non bitcoin users can see the value, it could be cheaper than money exchanges and bitcoin could probably escape many of the regulations of sending money away (since no money is ever leaving the country: you're just buyingsomething here  and selling overthere)

Also, a quick fix:
In the text input for the value, change type from "text" to "number" so when I use it on my phone it will show the correct number keyboard. Or even better use "cel" so that it will show a numberpad. The only trouble with the numberpad is that I'm not sure it has the "dot", but that's easily fixable if you limit the decimals to 2 or 3. Then if someone wants to send less than 0.0001 coins he should be able to touch "BTC" and pick a smaller unit ("mBTC", "nBTC") – or maybe even a local currency!

such a nice subreddit you've got here...
@_date: 2012-10-04 17:53:32
The main concept of bitcoins revolves around mining, and it's understandably hard to wrap your head around it.
Let me try to explain:
First, the "creators" of bitcoin are as special as the creator of morse code or the Internet, they created a protocol but can't control what other people do with it. That's what makes it different from Facebook credit or Warcraft gold pieces.
Secondly, bitcoins at solutions for math equations. There is a special algorithm called hashing,  which outputs a unique random number for every input. So if you want to say, know what number hashes to "82718af32h" your only option is to randomly test numbers to see what you get.
So the bitcoin network creates those math problems all the time, and if you can solve them you are awarded one coin. Althought it's hard for anyone to crack the problem, it's easy for anyone to check the solution, and therefore easy for yuto prove you are the owner of that new coin.
As more powerful computers enter the network, the network as a whole increases the difficulty of the problems, so that there is a limited number of coins given everyday, and that number will only decrease until we have 21 million coins in circulation.
A similar process happens when you want to send someone your coin, or part of it: you have to solve a smaller math problem just to ensure you are not sending the same coin to two different persons, and then you use that solution to broadcast to all other nodes who is the new owner of your coin.
Here's a tip: instead of thinking of each  coin as a "thing" you have and own, instead think of the whole network as a big bookeeping text file with a bunch of "I owe you"s being kept on  BitTorrent. The text just says "John has a coin. John sent his coin to Jane. Jane sent half a coin to Alice". Because money isn't really a thing, it's just a way to represent credit.

1) first there's logistics: I would have to somehow buy bitcoins in America using us dollars, then sell them for Reais, and get those dollars back to America, paying fees in every step
2) but even if you overcome this, the main issue is that the market here is just too small. The main bitcoin exchange, mercadobitcoin.com.br trades about 10-50 coins everyday, and a small trade can take hours or days until you find a buyer. 
As a BTC buyer, waiting is bad: since most people interested in buying bitcoins probably believe that it will become more valuable, they assume that waiting too long might make you miss an investment opportunity, if the price increases overnight. 
Also, there's the risk of keeping your money in a small bitcoin exchange: the site can be hacked, or the owners might just run away with everyones money. A typical bitcoin user is probably one that doesn't trust other people with their own money, they prefer having coins in their wallets than "credit" in an exchange.
So bitcoin buyers are willing to pay a premium for the the above reasons, and thus the  20% overhead.
Now if you're willing to take the risks and cann overcome the obstacles, I welcome everyone to do so. This will bring more money to the overvalued bitcoin markets, and hopefully bring all currecies rates closer to their true exchange rate.

Yeah, the bitcoin community is a little too prepotent on this "you can't counterfeit bitcoins!". It's very hard to make true counterfeit money also, but the reason people do is that there's always someone who will fall for an even bad counterfeit bill.
Counterfeiting bitcoins is essentially scamming someone in buying or exchanging real value for something worthless that looks legitimate. There are infinite ways to do that with bitcoins also.

As long as everyone trusts the system and agrees on the same text file, everyone how much money it's on the system and who owns it.

Very interesting! Are you involved with this startup? I wonder if it wouldn't work better with a bump interface, instead of a qrcode.
@_date: 2011-10-13 20:47:37
That's what I'm talking about: why are you adding both the key and the url to the piece of paper? It's hard to type so much, you have to make them small so they fit the paper and if they accidentally rip one letter off they lose everything
Wouldn't it be smarter if you created a bunch of small urls explaining what people should do with it? Since you already have the bitCoinIntro.org url, you could simply say:
This link is worth $1! Go to bitCoinIntro.org/XXX to redeem. XXX is of course a randomly generated hexadecimal code, or maybe a random word. Or this is also one of the few areas where a qrcode could be very useful. 
By using it with urls, you can dinamically change the key as you see fit – if the BTC value goes UP you can change the number of bitcoins you give away, if some code is never used you can add a expiration date, if the code is actually used you can know when it was. Also, you can track which posters where more used: codes posted on so and so university where ignored, while that other place they were all used. Finally, if people are forced to register you can make sure it's only one bitcoin per person..

I believe a serious manner in which bitcoin can go mainstream is if people see it as a way to instantly send money across borders with a very low exchange rate.

It would be a lot better if it was a website, using a tiny url of sorts. Like
or 
**changemoney.com/ShakyDemocracy** (no joke, this was actually the [first random phrase I got here!](
This way the person using it has a place to learn about bitcoin, choose a wallet softwareservice and redeem it's money all in one place. Also, bitcoiners could donate bitcoins to the pool, because spreading the word is the best way to make your own money more worthiwhile.
Another advantadge of having a site is that it could keep the usd-btc value current. If bitcoins devalued to the dollar, it could expire the older codes and spread the value so newer code could keep it's nominal face value ($5, $20 whatever). If bitcoin starts growing in value to the dollar, it could change the associated currency of the unused codes and spread the remaining either to create new codes and send them back to the original lenders (at which point they could either get their money invested back or keep spreading new codes around).
Of course, it's a centralized system, so all trust and security issues hold – and it could be done in open source software, so anyone could create it's own "donate bitcoin site".

The media was in love with bitcoin back in june, declaring it the next big thing that would change the world, mostly because of it's spetacular growth which was in part fueled by the people reading about it in the media. When it came to a sudden crash the media declared it dead. The bitcoin economy hasn't recovered yet.
Personally I don't care about the bubbles and speculation, and doubt bitcoin has a future as a end user currency – but I can really see it as a backend thing, for companies sending money abroad, online purchase, backing virtual money. The user will deal with dollars, euros, zyngacoins, but he is actually trading bitcoins.

The more people use bitcoins, the more valuable one's own bitcoins are. Of course there's a tragedy of commons, since if you're able to convince other people to promote bitcoins without spending yours, you get more. Here's an idea for a promotion that could actually work based on profit:
1. Set up a big promotional site. Grab a cool and short url. This only works if many people are behind it.
2. People lend bitcoins to a common pool. Donors are required to register (they can do so anonymously)
3. Bitcoin reedemable short URLs are created to the value of $5 dollars (fixed in USD, not BTC). Each URL contains a basic intro to bitcoin, list of software to install, finally the actual key for getting the coins and how to use them.
4. The keys are dinamically generated so each bitcoin will always be worth exactly $5, and will always have an expiration date 
5. The URLs are printed in all sorts of medias, real banknotes, fake cupons that look like banknotes, in plastic chips, in billboards whatever. The site follows the success of each medium and measures which campaign is more successful
6. If people use more bitcoins and the value goes up, the whole pool will get more valuable, and it can pay back the lenders with a small raise. First people to lend are the first that get paid back, the more you put in the more you can take back. If lenders choose not to take their money out, the bitcoins are thrown back in the pool, same rules
7. If bitcoin values go down, then the bank is insolvant. For example let's say the original pool was $200, but now is only worth $100. The people who donated the first $100 dollars can take their money out anytime, or allow it to keep there to see if the pile grows back again
There. If it seems I reinvented the wheel, it's true: this is the purpose of a bank. In fact that's pretty much how the government is trying to restart the economy, by throwing random money on it so it can circulate.

 &gt; We don't talk about the strength of the dollar and its ratio to Euros all the time, we talk about how to improve the US economy.
In many nn-US countries, comparing the local currency value to the dollar is one of many indicators of how well the economy is going. If the US isn't going under a big monetary crisis (not the current case) and your currency is losing a lot of value in relation to the USD, then it's a good guess that you are probably under a deep inflationary period. If the economy is strong and stable, and there's too much uncertainty on the dollar, then your local currency grows strong and values with the dollar.
In a country that also depends a lot on imports and exports, the dollar-local is very important also. If your local currency is losing it's value, then you can't buy a new Apple gadget or a Levi's Jeans, etc.
The main evaluation of bitcoin is the dollar and it has to be, since there isn't much (or anything at all) being produced, wages being paid, services being done using bitcoins. And the few cases in which there is, it's usually a real-life product or service, in which the dollar value is obvious. If I sell you a $1 dollar burguer using bitcoin, I bought all the materials using dollars. If I did you a service for 10BTC that I could do it for $50 dollars, then it's obvious that I lost money.
But if there was a strong, virtual community that used bitcoins for things that don't have an obvious real value, then it would be different. Say there was a community like reddit, maybe inside reddit, but instead of Karma, users had a fixed amount of KarmaCoins (one karmacoin valued at 1/10000 BTC, small enough that it wouldn't be really valuable, expensive enough it would be costly to spammers), so you would have to really judge before giving people your upvote. In this case, the Karmacoins would have a real intrinsic value inside the community, that would not depend on the dollar. Maybe the Karmanauts of this community would care about their dollar value, but the other 99% wouldn't really care.
Or imagine if a very popular online game, like farmville, WoW, second life (in it's hayday) or minecraft attached their virtual currency to bitcoins? Buying one sheep would be 1 virtual gold coin, and players wouldn't care about the USD value so much, because they were in it for the in-game value, not because of the dollar value. I'm not sure why a game publisher would do something like that (maybe to fight virtual gold farming?) but the main point would be: 
If you want to have a virtual economy with a strong economy not so dependent on the external factors, then you would have to build a community that has an intrinsic value and trade, and not so much based on real world trade. Countries have the luxury of having citizens and productive lands – who are the citizens of BTCountry?

Can someone explain the purpose of this law? 
What are exactly illegal in making a currency in the US? What I read is that there is but one law that was never enforced. This is what allows many districts and companies print their own "vouchers", "gift cards", or "municipal money" etc. As far as I know there isn't anything making bitcoin illegal.
The only law, as I understand it, is that forces a lender to clear you of debt if you can pay him in dollars – meaning he is forced to accept USD as payment, but he isn't forbidden in accepting anything else.
I think it's a fair system, otherwise I could send a memo to anyone that owes me money that according to my new terms of service I would only be accepting payments in avsabucks, a currency I hold the exclusive right to print and only hand to people in exchange for neck massages.

You're describing a correlation. 
If two things are cyclical but unrelated then the cycles should at some point get off sync, specially when one of the cycles if completely mechanical and we can predict them precisely for millennia and the other is a chaotic pattern. 
If markets had easily predictable patterns of boom and boost then they would have been predicted a long time ago and market forces would be as easily predictable as seasons. 
My point is that there are no real correlation between those two things: unless there are enough people believing in the correlation to make them act, making it into a self fulfilling prophecy.
But even thou it's a fascinating idea, it still works on the premise that MA works and I'm not even convinced of that. There are many forms of divinations that do not work after investigated by any scrutiny, yet people still pass them as knowledge.

It's "smart" because it knows who it belongs to and the ownership and contract conditions can be enforced by software. I can sell you a car and ask you to pay me only by next month.

In fact if you don't pay me I don't even need to get the car back, I can sell it to anyone else online and tell them to go your house and simply take the car in any way you can. Hell, if the car is self-driven I don't even need to do that: the car can simply say "fuck you, I'm out" and then drive to it's new owner's garage (if it's no physically locked inside another garage).

Even without any banker or government interference: the people who would profit more from an increase in the block reward are the same one who control the decision-the miners. 
So there's a perverse incentive to do a similar thing.. Here's a scenario: 
Suppose bitcoin achieves the most optimist scenario where its an essential part of the modern world economy, used for trade worldwide and seen as something that's not going away ever. In this scenario, each bitcoin is worth a lot and mining equipment is very expensive, mostly owned by people who are in for the money — maybe they're banks, corporations or just individuals but what matters is that the pure idealists are the minority. 
Now there's a schedule block reward halving coming up. Then someone finds some  flaw with that: maybe its technical, maybe it's an economic argument, what matters is that, like the Y2K or bank bailouts, its very hard to actually know how big a problem it will be until it actually happens. There's a chance it's a non issue, but there's also a chance that it will be a problem and then the whole system will be crumbling down and we can't afford that risk now can we?
Many heated arguments are held but you know that saying: "it's hard to make someone understand something when their paycheck depends on him not understanding it".. In the end most miners have an economic incentive to believe the issue is real. More than half then agree on postponing the block reward halving until the issue is addressed.  They're not creating more money, just buying some time. 
But then that temporary thing becomes permanent because no one wants to halve their paycheck voluntarily. And sudennly bitcoins are expected to go over the 21 million limit. People complain but since everyone holds bitcoins no one wants to abandon it and move to another currency. 
Once the cat is out, no one can tell what happens next. Maybe the block reward goes up. Maybe the block rewards gets permanent. Who gets to decide it? The same people who profit from it.

A bitcoin is owned by anyone who has a secret passphrase allowing you to move it. Here's what you can do, depending in your technical level:
* Create a paper wallet, print it into a nice diploma paper and give it ® someone you trust that she'll keep safe until she's grown up
* download electrum client which creates multiple addresses based on 12 random words. Create a nice painting with those words in order and give it to her explaining that there's a secret and when she grows she can spend it. 
* create a future transaction that will only be valid at a future date when she's 18.
Still you'd have to get the bitcoins for yourself first and then transfer them.  Beer trust a third party website with your coins for too long.

I'm a developer for the Ethereum foundation and agree with many points in this article: for instance Ethereum must become more than just a platform for token sales if it wants to prove it’s value–and I believe it will eventually, as a great platform for managing those funds in a transparent manner.
But an important clarification: **Vitalik is NOT a member of the “all star team” of Primal base, unlike they are promoting on their site and promoted facebook ads**. He never heard about them, never met (edit: maybe he did meet them, but afaik not as an advisor) them and neither would I if it weren’t for this scammers here trying to use his photo for self promotion. We can't fight all those scams as fast as they pop up.
As a member of that Community I do not share the belief that core developers are to blame for these abuses and many among us speak out against many of them. Also: Vitalik is definitely not a benevolent dictator on the ecossystem, he is more like the queen of england — everyone respects his opinion because he doesn’t force it against anyone.

No it's the voice of someone who's constantly seeing good work being demeaned with people with half truths out of context. 
I was proud to be among the group who tried to save The DAO using just the "rules of the code": they needed a public voice and I volunteered to be one. After that beginning more people came in the group, the techniques became more advanced and I didn't have anything to contribute anymore so o focused on the fork debate. 
I wasn't there by the time the fork came and it became ETC, and I think they did one I'll advised thing, which was to try to avoid refunding the dao token holders (most of which didn't have a classic sync) in eth - and even that they didn't do it anonymously but through a known Swiss entity. And despite people crying for all kinds of terrible things they were trying to do, everything they did was exactly what they promised to do: they refunded every single person who had lost in the dao and held dao tokens, they worked hard, built contracts, created new creative ways to get etc off the black hat, and when the expiration date arrived and people again accused them of running away with millions what did they do? Extend the deadline again. 
So yeah, I have nothing to hide and I'm proud of everything I've done for the crypto community

Sure, in theory an analysis of a passord strength is no different from an analysis of a brainwallet. But most users have grown accostumed to the idea that a password like "Tr0ubador!" or "my hovercraft is full of eels" are strong. They are if we are speaking of passwords for most user accounts.
But imagine if google or apple made their user full user and password table available for download, some of them without salt, and also published how much money there was in every account and allowed anyone that guessed the password to just take the money. That would be the biggest breach ever and those companies would certainly up the requirements of what they considered "strong"..

Good for you because you clearly don't understand one very important thing about bitcoins: the money on exchanges do not belong to you, if the exchange is hacked or closes your money is gone. 
1) google how to create a paper wallet
2) transfer all your bitcoins into it
3) create a wallet on blockchain.info and add your public address as "watch only" so you can always check your balance see his much you have and if it still there
4) keep a few copies of the paper wallet on places you trust 
5) forget about it for a year

Take a look at ripple for example. There are many alt coins but honestly the only one I see traded is litecoin and it seems to be used mostly to mine bitcoins indirectly. But ripple has a real chance of becoming big because if has many advantages. But it has many drawbacks so there's a lot of development going on to add the ripple advantages to bitcoin. 
So can the bitcoin open source bitcoin community create decentralized exchanges and holdings of multiple currencies before Open Coin can make ripple into a true open source decentralized cryptocurrency? I don't know but in the end we all win because both projects get more features. 
Bitcoin won't become obsolete suddenly, the next big thing that will surpass bitcoin will be around for years, mostly flying under the radar. 
That's why you should always diversify: if all your fortune is on bitcoins then you're being a fool. When you see something else you think it's big take money from whatever you hold and think is going down.

I learned about bitcoin in 2011, right before the mtGox Crash. I was instantly hooked with the concept and couldn't take my mind out of it, but it all felt very complex. There was no way to buy it for me, other than a series of international transactions and credit card fees that added 40% over the price of the coin or depositing my money into "some guy who ran an exchange" bank account and pray that his exchange was real.
I kept reading about the technology and falling more and more in love with it. Until I saw the price had recovered from the crash and was at $20, I just realised "this thing isn't going to simply go away", and got in the train.
I don't regret anything: I never put too much money on it, and waited until I actually understood things.

I'm a farmer and I want to buy some equipment. I know the equipment pays itself in two to three years but I don't have the money upfront. I get a loan on my car which, this being the future has a smart cryptographic key. 
If I don't pay back on time the car will be automatically transfered to the lender and it won't even open for me anymore. If it's smart enough it can even drive itself away from my farm and to the lender. Since the loan is 100% secure many lenders will be willing to give me money so I can probably get it for lower rates.

Geeks hated GUI interfaces, hated the mouse, and still hate the the iPad because it's a dumbed down computer. For the true geeks, comand line interface is still there, but for many many people the "dumbed down computer" meant they were able to do more stuff with it, with less risk.
The characteristics of bitcoin that might make someone love, like decentralization, self regulation and anonimity are not what other people might like. And the nice things of those things being possible is that they can be wavered. You can choose to trust a big company with your coins, you can choose to forego anonimity for some security, you choose to pay some fees to have an online wallet with backup, you choose to pay for a middle man. 
If bitcoin is to suceed, it's inevitable that it will have it's Apples, it's Amazons and it's paypals, it's even probable that they will be the same companies.

You deposit X amount of dollars in MtGox. Now MtGox keeps all that money in it's own account and gives you colored coins that are redeemable for the same amount (minus a fee) of dollars. You can't spend the dollars anymore as they are controlled by mtGox, not yourself, and in order to redeem them you have to send MtGox the coins back.
In a sense MtGox stops being an exchange and becomes simply a bank/ credit issuer/buyer and seller of colored coins. MtGox can also host information about bids and ask prices with given addresses but anyone else can do that and these work more like classifieds: they just give buyers and sellers contact information, the transactions are made in private.

They didn't "mine 100% of the currency", they came up with a system where mining is unnecessary and set up an arbitrary starting number. They haven't addressed the distribution problem yet and I'm curious to see what they come up and we should  hold judgment until then. If they decide to stimulate a central bank and distribute it only to their rich partners then I'll agree with you, wrong use it and the currency will probably be worthless. But I believe there's an opportunity for them to do good and come up with a fairer system than bitcoin, a way to distribute wealth evenly to the world population. I don't know about you but if I was setting up a new currency today and had the opportunity to rewrite the power and economic history of the world, I would try not to be a system that enriches even more  college educated people from the western hemisphere with access to spare computers and plentiful electricity...

I understand your concern and it's a valid issue with the technology. The difference is that a bank has decades of online infrastructure and hundreds of years of a legal framework, bitcoin is aiming to replace all that. It's in no way a small task as there's a lot of skepticism which is why you were able to buy them for dimes a few years ago. Since it became more valuable, many hackers an botnets have switched from spamming to bitcoin hacking, so there is a big profit to be made. 
There's also a question of how much money you have: if you had a single bitcoin, I'd say: go to blockchain.info choose a strong password and two actor authentication and you'll be fine. You can even trade with their iPhone app. 
If it was a dozen or so bitcoins I would say: "Follow the first advice for pocket change, but create a paper wallet for the rest of your coins."
More than that and I would get paranoid. See, it's not that's harder to keep 100 or 0.001 bitcoins: just that the cost of mistakes are bigger. 
There may come a day were transacting bitcoin will be super easy and safe even for newcomer. If that day comes then it will e much more expensive, maybe a hundred fold more. But maybe there's a chance that it might not, and their value will crash again. 
Finally, if you cash a big part of it, remember to talk to an accountant, you might have to pay capital gains taxes.

Still according to last mtGox AMA they keep 90% of the funds in cold storage, so most coins in their funds are just kept changing hands inside mt gox never leaving. 
You deposit in mtGox because they provide you a service that you believe will make you more money.
 Suppose mtGox offers a new service called "professional day trader" where they'll use a smart algorithm and some professional day traders to do your trading for you. Or maybe they simply give you a fixed interest in your deposits and loan bitcoins for other people.  Or maybe let's call this service "ASIC miners share", or whatever: the point is that when offered monetary reward in exchange of keeping your coins safe for you, it seems that most people will happily take their chances and trust other people with their money.

I don't understand how people can even fall for this, makes me very sad. 
I just read the article and the argument is basically  "we're innovative", "makes a lot of money", "you can be successful", "you can be a millionaire", therefore "give us money!". 
I'm trying to watch the video but it's incredibly dull, and full of bulshit terms.
Unfortunately I think it's on purpose: the long rambling bullshit is made to turn off smart people as soon as possible, while other people might be dazzled with the "smart sounding terms" with the only terms they understand is money..
As far as I understood it seems you're on the spot: you pay 350 dollars per month to install their "mining software" and the more people you invite, the more bitcoins they can give you. 
They claim they can give everyone a bitcoin per month, but if the network reaches 100,000 people they can give people up to 6 bitcoins per month. Their price is off, since they claim each btc is valued at ~$180 dollars.
So here's the joke:
* They admit, on their own video that you are paying more than the bitcoins they sell you are worth
* They stress that your computer MUST be on the internet for 24/7 for a full month. I suppose they can use this to not send to anyone who has to restart or their internet is down.
* Of course their rules will change with new bitcoin prices, and they'll use it to "prove" their investment is worthwhile: if bitcoin prices rises, here's proof that the people who invested on them made money, if bitocoin prices falls they can raise the rewards and prove that their program is growing and everyone is getting more reward.
It's natural for scammers to take advantage of the technology, but it makes me worry because bitcoin is pretty much unheard of in Brazil and this might be their first introduction to it..

I actually believe that if we move all our trades to digital it will make paying taxes even easier! It's natural that digital wallets will become tools on your personal finance so you'll be able to know how much money you spent and how much you earned etc, which will make figuring out how much taxes you actually owe much much easier. The only difference is that this information will be kept private as it should, and it's up to the individual to do what he believe is right.

Are you the kind of guy that buys gift cards for Christmas and then just sends the redeem code by email? 
Giving a virtual gift doesn't mean not giving anything physical, this is similar to say "instead of buying her a diamond ring I transferred the same amount of money to her bank account". Maybe you're not into rings and that's your choice but personally I think carrying a symbol of my marriage with me to be very romantic: any symbol would do, a ring, necklace, clitoral piercing. 
The whole diamond engagement ring thing is a very American tradition that I find funny: where I come from we just give a gold marriage ring and wear them on the left hand during the engagement. When the wedding comes, we just switch hands: no need to buy a second ring. 
Now if she is a cryptocurrency geek as well then you could have printed her a physical bitcoin ring. There are many ways: engrave the private key, or maybe write a small poem with funny characters that is the key to a brainwallet or, my favorite, use armory to get a n of m signature. Lock a significant number of bitcoins in an account that requires two of three codes embedded in a jewelry: one that you keep, the other that she keeps and a third that's a backup somewhere in case someone loses a ring. 
But that's just me.

I think bitcents is a terrible name. First of all it's not SI: it's centimeters, not metercents. Secondly, it's a bit demeaning: a cent is a small value in most currencies, something almost worthless, and soon enough a hundredth of a bitcoin will be used for most things. Also it doesn't scale: what's smaller than a bitcent? a bitthousandth? I prefer SI units: centibitcoins, milibitcoins, microbitcoins etc.

Thanks. I just googled them and I'm under the impression that are what I'm (mis)calling "light clients". It's a bitcoin client that doesn't download any part of the blockchain and instead relies on a "highly trusted node" to read the transactions. What happens if that node is blocked?
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:49:31
I don't see how that's an "attack": There are legitimate reasons someone might want to have tons of microtransactions. It's a way to disrupt the blockchain, sure, but since there's no profit this way then all that needs to be done is to increase the attack cost. Maybe prevent a block that has too many free transactions and too many private transactions that were not broadcasted to other miners. This way, all transactions are treated equally and if someone wants to create a block with a billion transactions it will have to make sure he will have to keep broadcasting millions of paid transactions to other miners.

"Fix it"? And who are you talking to? Who's going to fix it? There's no one to fix it for you, you're missing the point!
Bitcoin is technology. Like most technology people who improve it are you and me. The PC was hard, some guys in a garage "fixed that" and became Apple and Mocrosoft. The web was hard, then the people who "fixed it" became Yahoo, Google, Facebook. 
Bitcoin isn't going to be made easier by the foundation or western union, it's going to made that way by people not much smarter than me and you. In fact, that's our job, the guys in the frontline. We are here because we love this nascent technology and want to help it grow: even if you're not a programmer you can help by designing, helping, talking or simply putting your coins to a good use by using it to reward the people who help the technology.

Exactly. Some people bought Apple or Google shares at the right time and became millionaires. Some people buy lottery tickets and become millionaire.

Also, millionaires don't sit on piles of money all day: they invest in other companies, buy things, lose money.

Bitcoin is related to the finding of prime numbers: he is thinking about another kind of cryptography and it's false.
Bitcoiners own special numbers: false. A private key is ideally a meaningless random number.

The cost of a double spend attack. Even without a single entity having 50% of the hash power, it still possible to do a double spend and reverse a single transaction with a moderate amount of computing power. 
The more confirmations and thus the more time you wait, it becomes harder. So it might be profitable to do a double spend attack and reverse a $3000 dollar cash transaction, but not a $50 one, so it would make more sense for a machine to allow cash withdrawals for small bills with few or no confirmations, to allow a quick experience, and still require 10 confirmations for a $1000 dollar withdrawal.

"Fortunes are made by buying low and selling too soon".
Don't try to predict markets, if moves were predictable then the price would be already there. I buy when I have money to spare and sell when I need cash.
So I assume you're not broke. If you have hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin and want to hear advice from random internet people here's mine: stop day trading and consider angel investing in bit coin companies.
This doesn't mean "day trade btw shares" it means "find people who are building interesting things in bitcoin, call them up and say "I want to give you 50k dollars for you to continue building this nice stuff and in exchange you'll give me a % of your new bitcoin startup". Go to a startup accelerator and ask about bitcoins. Most of them will fail but invest in a few and there's a chance you'll have a major position in the next PayPal or Square.

Imagine I take a dollar bill and write on it "I, avsa, promise to give a cow to whoever gives me this dollar bill". Now, if you trust me and want a cow, I can sell you that dollar bill for a value higher than $1. You can then go in the city and trade it for a goat. Then the goat shepherd can find me and give me the dollar bill and demand I give him the cow.
Now, of course I can refuse to give the ~~goat~~ cow: so the goat shepherd now only has a dollar bill, but he will go back to the city and tell everyone my promises are worthless and I shouldn't be trusted and I'll go out of business. 
It's basically the same, but with bitcoins instead of dollar bills, and because of the blockchain anyone can take a look on how many "avsa cow certificates" are in circulation and therefore deduce if I'm just making this thing up or if I actually have any cows.

Even if someone is a true believer and never wants to touch fiat again, leaving 10 million dollars in a single address is crazy risky. If you created an address in 2010, when bitcoin barely existed for a few years, what are the chances that there was some bug in the random number generator, or a malware in his computer or whatever? Chances are slim, but would you risk 10M? Also, the more visible those addresses are, the more likely they are to be researched, identified and linked to someone. 
It's simply more sensible to split them in multiple addresses using more modern safety measures (like 2 auth or SSS) and distribute them in multiple backups.

Also, Paypal has little to gain by jumping on the Bitcoin bandwagon now. They are not interested in bitcoin as an investment, so they don't need to buy now to sell later. As a currency it's not as interesting for them: since they already own both sides of the transactions they would be paying more fees to miners in which currently they receive fees.
They have a lot to lose also: their customers will blame them if they lose money, are scammed or their purchase power drops because of the bitcoin price fluctuation, meaning they would have to keep values in USD and keep all private keys to themselves, becoming an online wallet.
There's only a few scenario where Paypal gains: first if bitcoin really becomes popular on the consumer side and many people start holding wallets and want to purchase on ebay and paypal affiliates: paypal becomes bitpay. Secondly if bitcoin becomes very popular among merchants and paypal sees an opportunity on making current paypal users be able to buy in sites that do not accept paypal: paypal becomes blockchain.info.
In both cases Paypal doesn't need to do anything right now. If they want to be ready they can build a service in secret and leave it ready to ship, but since they can probably build a product very quickly that wouldn't be necessary...

When they give away a ripple they can't control or print more of it. The client is already open source, once the server code is open source someone else could set up a splinter group completely separated from Open Coin.
I also believe they control too much of the initial coins, and I think that if they don't release them fairly and within a reasonable timeframe, no one will trust them. But I don't believe it's a "get-rich-quick" scheme: convincing the world that their own currency is worth something won't be fast or easy. 
Their business model is worthy: they are building something different, if the world think it's useful then they will be rich, if the world think it's useless then no harm is done and they just wasted their time and investors money. Lots of great things are built that way.

Oh, now I see.. Well the same criticism stands: if you want people, particularly the kind of people who don't trust third parties that would like your service, then you need to look a lot more professional. I understand you want to have a "fluid" site, but in the link I sent you previously you'll find dozens of "responsive" designs that will work on any platform and will look more professional.
Think of your business as a Nash equilibrium, your site and company is your "risk funds". Customers going in, having a bad experience and trashing your site is a lose-lose situation. You need to  invest enough in your site, company and reputation so that you have a Nash equilibrium incentive to do the right thing. 
This includes not only using a professional template, but putting your money, name and reputation on the line.
Hope that heps!

You know, Hollywood usually loves physical stuff because, the saying goes, making a heist with guns and explosions on a safe full of money is much cooler than a nerd typing on a keyboard. 
But I think a movie based on this premise would actually be very cool. Imagine the main character is a hacker, living in a shared SF apartment. He has OC and has to switch on and off his lights  multiple times whenever he comes in his house. He looks like a regular guy but is secretly a drug distribution lord. The FBI is watching him and his money closely and one day they breaks into his home and arrests him: except when they come in they turn the lights on without switching it off multiple times. Suddenly all the addresses the FBI was watching starts beeping: his money is disappearing from his wallets, draining into obscure corners and disappearing while the guy is handcuffed. Turns out he wasn't compulsive at all, he had simply programmed a dead's men switch on his light switches, so that if he didn't turned it on and off an exact number of times the money would be taken away to a safe haven. Money, evidence, data, it's all gone.
At some point later he makes a deal. He just says, in prison "truce cloy catfish montane homesick barter". And poof, the money is back.

You donated money to a person who runs a forum. If he hasn't spent the money the way you wished, then you can call him out and ask people not to donate again, but that's not a scam...
If you donated $250 dollars to a local pet shelter and cane back one year and a half later and the shelter hadn't done a paint job, would you call them scammers? Maybe the owner of the shelter ran with the money, maybe he just misspent it, maybe running a shelter is more expensive and complicated than both of you thought. But you certainly can't ask for $5000 back because that's how much you could have made by investing it somewhere else, that's plainly silly.

By the last attempt at accounting someone calculated that just by keeping the first bitcoin node running for a year satoshi must have mined at least 1 million BTC. He could have easily mined another million if he wanted and no one will ever know, so realistically satoshi owns ~~10-20%~~ 4-9% of all bitcoins that will ever exist (and 10-20% the ones in circulation right now). 
Those coins were never spent so theres a chance that he didn't keep the key but if he did I think he deserve it. Same thing for the Opencoin team: they created ripple they deserve to get rich developing it IF the world decides its a useful thing, and a very important part of them deciding is how fairly they distribute the remaining 70%..

The best way I can describe it is: bitcoin is a zero trust currency. You don't need to trust anyone other than yourself to use it. Ripple is a tradeable trust currency. You choose a validator to trust to check your transactions, you choose a third party to trust with debt, you trust a gateway to owe you money, etc. 
In the end if no one trusts it, the ripples will be worth fractions of cents, so OpenCoin has all the incentive in the world to aquire that trust.

Read up a bit on **smart property** and talks by **Mike Hearn**. Bitcoin technology could really help improve loans to reduce risks, increase competition and therefore reduce interest.
1) Bob owns an object that understand smart property. It means that you bought it with bitcoins, and the change of ownership was recorded in the blockchain, in such way that the object itself understand you are his new owner: maybe it's a computer or smartphone that will only decrypt for someone who can prove ownership of a given private key, or a door that will only unlock for it's owner, or maybe a vehicle that will only accept orders from it's owner and is able to drive itself to a new location.
2) Bob needs some cash, maybe to pay for this new fancy smart object he just bought, or maybe to pay for another project of his own. Alice has money and is willing to lend it to bob for some interest.
3) Alice gives the money to Bob and they sign a digital contract saying Bob has X months to pay back the money, in such and such conditions and with such and such number of payments. He offers his smart object as a collateral for the loan and it is included on the contract. This contract is an independent computer program that has multiple inputs: Bob's signature, Alice's signature, the Object's signature, payments, time and maybe a given bit coin exchange rate, and based on those variables it will do one of these scenarios.
4a) After some time Bob pays back the amounts he owes with interest. All conditions are met and the contract is now null, so he retains back all ownership of the object, and Alice has now more bitcoins than she had before.
4b) Bob isn't able to meet all the conditions of the loan. The contract knows this, and contacts his smart object which now automatically changes it's ownership to either Alice or a middle man that will renegotiate with Bob. If it's a computer, it will now refuse to work for Bob, if it's a car it will drive itself to a new parking lot, if it's a door it will not open for Bob anymore. 
In all cases, notice that everyone got what they wanted. In either way Bob got to keep his money to do what he wanted. If what Bob tried to accomplish fails he loses his car/computer/house but that's exactly what he willingly signed for. In either way Alice gets either her money or the car/computer/house back, which may or may not be the same value, but again that's what she also willingly signed for. She doesn't even need to go collect it in person, she can simply resell the object on the block chain and allow the new owner to claim it from Bob (if the object cannot move by itself).
Everyone knows exactly their risks and consequences. No lawyer, police, banker or thug needs to be involved. Since it's all in the network the contract will be enforced no matter what. Since Alice doesn't need to do anything to get her money or collateral back, she doesn't need to be even in the same country: meaning that Bob can choose the lender that will give him, literally, the most favourable rate **in the world**. Everyone wins. Except, of course, bankers,  lawyers and thugs.

Think that instead of selling a "coin" you're selling a physical wallet, in which people can put their own money, or it comes with a few already. 
I would never trust to buy a coin with a qr code that I didn't generate myself so you have a few options:
* allow the buyer of the coin to Print and embed the codes themselves, so in a sense you'd be selling fancy bitcoin paper and a bit looking place o store it
* create a encrypted address: search for it on the wiki in not sure the correct name but mostly it's a shared address where I send you an encrypted code without revealing the private key and you use that with a random code you create I generate a public address that can only be redeemed with the original passphrase.

Maybe we agree more than you think. "I wish I had bought in 2011 when it was cheap!" is something you hear a lot around here. But many people forget it was freaking hard to buy it in 2011. You had probably to know someone who had it, or give your credit card to an unknown site, or deposit money in some stranger's bank account, and then had to pray you were actually paying the good guys, not the scammers, and that the service you chose to put your money in wouldn't be hacked. Hell, when I first heard about bitcoins the only place in my country to buy it from was from a "dude" that lived a thousand kilometers away.
Bitcoin was hard and risky back then, therefore no one wanted, so it was also cheaper. Bitcoin is still hard and insecure but it's a lot easier and there are much better tools around today than last year or the year before that. So the price rose.

Here's a true story that migh help get things started:
There's a pacific island that or many centuries, the only currency they had were round disks of a given stone. But that stone isn't exist anywhere in the island and the disks had to be produced far away and brought back to the island by canoe, making the process very hard. Because the biggest the stone, the harder they were to carry, the bigger were more valuable and by the 16th century most "coins" would weigh over a 100kg, making them impossible to carry. 
But still they were very valuable, used mostly for important trades like a dowry or a home and owning just one would make you a wealthy man on the island. But since they were so cumbersome to carry, they could be traded multiple times without ever being moved: trades/gifts were made in public gatherings and everyone knew whose stone belonged to whom. 
One day an islander was bringing home a great and beautiful coin that he had labored over months  in the other island when his canoe flip sides and the coin went to the bottom of the sea. 
Luckily everyone in the canoe survived and had seen the stone and told everyone in the island about it. So since everyone knew the stone actually existed, it still held value and could be traded like the others. Like most stones it wasn't moved but everyone knew who was the current owner of the stone in the bottom of the sea...
Some reflections:
1) Why did the villagers "decide" to use a kind of stone that wasn't available in the island? Couldn't they use a more common thing like seashells?
2) If the stones didn't actually need to be moved to hold value, why bother moving them to the island in the first place?
3) Like the stone in the bottom of the ocean, you rarely actually see the money in your bank. When you send money to somewhere else, *what the bank actually moves*? 
4) The stones still exist today and are sometimes given as symbolic gifts in weddings but their demise as an economic system ended when Europeans started trading island goods with large quantities of stones they were bringing themselves. What *piece of technology* ultimately ended up destroying that economic system and what exactly did it do?

A insurance company ran by ten very smart engineers is much more efficient than one with thousands of low level employees, managers, accountants and salespeople, and thanks to bitcoin the former could have as many clients as the latter. 
It all really depends on what exactly you're ensuring. In the end, an insurance is a bet: I bet there will be a tornado in my area, that my house will catch fire, that I'll have a car accident, that Ill need to go to the hospital. The insurance company bets I won't and we settle this bet every month. 
Of course some of those things are harder to verify than others, some bets are actually an incentive, specially if I can bet that my neighbors house will catch fire. 
But the important thing, its a solvable problem, and if one particular one isn't the others are. Also insurance is just one example: micro lending, donations to a cause, venture capitalists, all those are big institutions that move money.

This has nothing to do with OP claims, but I'm answering. They didn't "premine" anything, they created the coin and have a stake on making it be of any value. 
Bitcoin mining is also arbitrary: why do people who happened to have a powerful computer somewhere in 2009-2013 have 50% of all coins in existence? Why is it "fair" that people who happened to have gold or oil in their property are the ones who can sell them?  
If OpenCoin fails to find a way to distribute it in such a way most people would consider "fair" then Ripple as a technology will fail and XRPs will be worth 0.

This might seem a large number but its less than eBay's monthly revenue which was if 14B in 2012. It's fees are ~10% which means eBay must be moving around 140B from buyers to sellers pocket.  
Amazon made 61B in revenue last year from its various services and Paypal (eBay company) made 5.6B in revenue mostly from 10-2% fees. 
Those numbers are hard to compare of course: how much of the bitcoin economy is used for moving goods and paying for services? How many dollars do these companies move?

Hi. Thanks for the long answer. I own a non-bitcoin related site which falls pretty much on the category you describe as the "perfect match for advertisers": tons of pageviews, low engagement. It's a content business in portuguese, we pay people to write content, we publish it. As a result we make some money with advertisment, not enough to become rich but enough to pay our writers and a few employees.
I'm just interested in bitcoin as a medium for international money exchange, as at least 10% of our revenue is eaten by banks transfer fees. My readers never heard about it, and honestly the owners haven't either.

I'm sorry that's not a valid argument. If bitcoin can't handle a site like Silk Road, then it has a very big problem. If there's any future in it, then it should allow as many transactions daily as there are cash exchanges. 
Also I never bought the concept of "spamming the network". Just prune the history already? The only thing you need to know about it are how many unspent coins there are. Leave the test in a hash and someone else keeps a copy..

Take a look at "smart property" on the bitcoin wiki. You might be interested in that. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:27:45
In bitcoin:
* client finds an exchange or service willing to trade  dollars for bitcoins (ie. BitPay)
* You send the client your bitcoin address and the client sends you the bitcoins
* you find an exchange or service willing to trade bitcoins for dollars (ie. MtGox or your trusted friend Bob)
In Ripple:
* You send the client your ripple address and the client tries to send you the X dollars.
* Ripple will try to see if they can find a trust path between you and the client.
* If it finds one, then it makes the transaction and in the system there will be a notice saying that some person you know (Your trusted friend Bob) or a company you trust  (ie. RipplePay) now owes you X amount of dollars.
* If it doesn't find a path then you'll have to find a common path, probably signing up (say RippleGox) or they can send you Ripples in which case the process is similar to bitcoins.
I have a ripples and bitcoins and I find both fascinating.

Well this only works if you care about the taint. If Alice says Bob's coins are tainted, Carol can simply ignore Alice and accept them anyway. The same goes both ways: if Alice claims their coins are worth a ton of gold, Bob can take a look at the blockchain, realize that Alice has a 100 trillion  worth of gold in her taint and simply value it as satoshis.

Please please read carefully about bit coin security. Download Armory and practice creating wallets before you connect to your computer. Do not open you flash drive on a computer that's online, preferably do it after booting in safe mode. Do not move all your coins to the same place, and do not move them to an online wallet or exchange. If you lose it, if some hacker gets it, or if you make an error, they will be gone.
But other than that, feel free to cash them. Keep some just for good luck's sake. The price is going up, approaching an all time high and can go higher still or drop drastically, but it's unlikely to go under a $100 anytime soon, and it will only go under $10 if some catastrophe happens in the bit coin world. If you bought them at cents, you'll be okay either way.

If you could predict the next one then you'd sell just before it happened. If everyone did that, then the crash would happen the day before that, which logically would make it the day before that one also, ad infinitum. You would conclude then that (1) the crash would happen as soon as anyone could predict any crash happening at one point in the future or (2) the new price would adjust for the future conditions so no crash would happen.
In reality no one can ever predict the market unless you have some information that no one does.

Actually I think it's not self excludent: unless there's a method that can keep the blockchain in a reasonably small size (and "reasonably" really depends on what kind of device we're talking) then it's still a problem.
Say we manage to prune 99% of the blockchain size. But bitcoin goes viral and the number of transactions increase 100 fold, and we're back to the same issue.
Or say we manage to keep the blockchain at 1GB. It's still too big for a cheap smart phone, meaning that anyone using a phone (which I suspect will be the majority of users) will have to rely on using a webwallet or a light wallet, both that connect to a small numbers of servers that could be blacklisted by a government or ISP.

@_date: 2013-05-01 13:43:55
OpenCoin has stated that it will keep 20% of all XRPs to fund it's operation and distribute the remaining 80%. The last time I saw, it was calculated that just by running the first bitcoin node for a year, Satoshi mined at least a million coins in unspent addresses, but it could easily twice that. If they kept their private keys, this meants that Satoshi owns at least 10-20% of all bitcoins ever – I doubt anyone in this sub would have a problem with that.
The issue is really about what they do with the other 80%. I believe that if they don't announce exactly how they plan addressing it then they will lose the community trust, but I'm holding judgement for now.

In bitcoin every satoshi is accounted for and can be traced from your pocket to every previous owner until the original block it was mined from. I have 1 bitcoin in my wallet and I color them with a public label like "these are worth 100 hours of my time". Any money I sent from that point from that address is therefore "colored".
Yes, if I send more "uncolored" money to the same address or if I mix color and uncolored money, things can be complicated to sort out, but that's why it should be managed by the client software.

In your scheme a untrusted partner could also use your passphrase and transfer to his own wallet. You have to trust your partner in this.
Or even not: Give someone a signed transaction for to transfer X amount of coins, anytime, to address N, that you control. Also give him a signed transaction to send a smaller amount from address N to an address your partner controls, as his service fee, but this second transaction has a time delay of a few days. So if he transfers the money while you are still free, you can always revert the transaction before him.

1. Premined: premined is a misnomer. Bitcoin has a built-in distribution system, Ripple doesn't have. They haven't solved the distribution problem yet and if they don't soon their invention won't be worth much. What's the problem here?
2. It's only like that because there's only one node, and it's only like that because they haven't yet released the nodes. There's no "51% attack" on ripple, because it works in a different way: you decide which nodes you "trust" and if you see that there's a group of nodes colluding to block someone, then you can simply decide not to trust them anymore..
3. It's not fully open source.. yet. Let's debate this again in a year.
4. That's a fair criticism, but it's a economic criticism not a technical one, like the "deflationary death spiral" criticism of bitcoins. I say: the only way to find out these theories is to test them in the wild, and cryptocurrencies finally allows us to make economic theory into a testable science...
5. False: Anyone can be a node in Ripple, like anyone can set up his own servers for the world wide web. Most servers in the WWW are owned by corporations, but that doesn't mean it's not open..
There's one big criticism of ripple that no one addresses:
6.It's completelly not anonymous, in a much more severe way than bitcoin. "Trust connections", which are essential to the systme, will be very similar to social network connections, meaning that if you can figure out a small portion of the identity of the addresses you can probably figure out everyone else..

Yes, but those are just immediate problems we need to solve: for bitcoin to succeed it must run on a cheap prepaid phone in the Sahara, it must be as easy to send money as an SMS, and it must be incredibly easy to make it secure and have a backup.

Yes, that's what I did and that's why I didn't lose any money. But it's also a matter of luck: deposits take time to process, orders take time to find other people to fulfill them, and the smaller the exchange the more time it takes. Last time I logged in it took me hours to find a seller willing to sell me for $85 (it was last week when Bitcoins were still $60 at MtGox). 
When you're in a small exchange you are willing to pay more or sell for less just to be able to take you money quickly, which explains the bad rates..

false. They came up with a system that doesn't require mining, so to kickstart they simply created a fixed large number.


They intend to keep 20% to fund their operations and give away the remaining. I see no problem with the 20% – would you be mad if you knew Satoshi had 2-4 million bitcoins? The haven't made clear how or when they plan on distributing the remaining 80%, they could be all FED or Paypal about it, or they can be all Ghandi about it, we can't know yet.


It's unclear on how users will use XRP, but it's obvious that OpenCoin believes that they will be of value.


It will only be profitable if other people see value and use it. I see no problem in someone profiting from something they created. 


They created a completelly different system than bitcoin. It's not clear wether consensus can work better than a proof of work, or if destroying transaction fees is better than sending fees to people running the software – I applaud anyone that tries to do something different, even if it doesn't work in the end.

Why do so many bitcoin supporters have so much hate for ripple? It's the only alternative currency that's actually trying to do something different than "bitcoin with a few parameter changes". 
Sure ripple has some big issues, the uncertainty about the distribution and central control the biggest one: but *if opencoin fails to address those issues and distribute the existing xrps fairly their investment will be worthless*, so they have an incentive to play nice, and once the xrps are distributed they will have as much control of ripple as Gavin has of bitcoins. 
I see some great features of ripple:
* faster confirmation times (a few seconds until the ledger closes)
* no blockchain to be downloaded 
* works with local currencies 
They also have a different approach to contracts and smart property. 
I'm holding a bit of ripple (but more bitcoins) and I'm just watching in the sidelines to see who evolves and develops quicker. It's like seeing the personal computer OS wars all over again. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:56:42
There's no way to "prove" how many people own which bitcoins, so it's pure speculation.
There has been sellouts of millions of dollar of bitcoins in a short time and the price recovered very quickly, but of course there's a chance that dumping enough money out might just be able to crash it. Notice that in the end he WILL have less bitcoins: if a sell order of a million coins crashes the price, attempting to buy the same number of coins back will raise the price again, it's a symmetrical game.
And every time something like this happens, then that early adopter has just distributed his bitcoins among other players and he is unable to do it again, having just helped distribute the coins more. 
Can the price be manipulated: yes. 
But a bitcoin worth $100 or $10,000 are still technologically useful for the same reasons. So if you want to get in because it's interesting technology, it shouldn't affect that. If you want to get in to get rich quick, then you'll probably lose money as soon as the price crashes.

If the technology is sound, the code is open, and the distribution issue becomes a problem someone else can always fork it.
Thing is, mining is a necessary part of bitcoin, because it works with proof of work and "work" requires more and more powerful computers: so it makes sense to pay them back with the same coin.
Ripple uses consensus and there's no available way to distribute it. Do you give it away as a lottery? Do you simulate mining? Do you give them away to the people with bitcoins?
If I was creating a currency, I would make it so that every person would be awarded with a single coin, every year, on their birthday. But I can't think of any way of doing that which doesn't require a central government and the loss of anonymity...

This would require that all clients be refactored to support the new blockchain and the way it's mined etc, this would also mean that you wouldn't have the power of all the miners combined power of securing the bitcoin blockchain.
Colored coins are backward compatible: If my "colored coin" supporting client sends you a new coin you can receive it and prove ownership to anyone even if you client doesn't support colored coins – you would only have to be careful not to send any other amount to that same address or spend it in anyway – unless you wish to pay your transaction fee in gold..

I know the plural of anecdote isn't data but my personal experience is that I actually prefer spending bitcoins than credit cards when the option is available. Because as I bought those coins a while ago  for less than they're worth now, I feel like I have a discount on everything. Keeping a portion of bitcoins made me want to save more so I can spend them later, not hoard them infinitely. 
The thing is: I simply cannot see how someone could even create a inflationary currency without rewarding some players more than others and I can't see how this is good for the economy. 
But this is all theoretical: the huge increase in value of bitcoin is not related to the inflationary aspect it has, but of an Increase of demand. If demand didn't change then BTC should experience inflation since over $150k is being created every hour.

Actually they don't need to change a thing on the customer side, the end customer doesn't need to know about bitcoins. They can accept fiat money in one end, give fiat money the other and transfer it the least expensive legal way they can: bitcoins, ripples, gold. If they move funds in enough amounts they can get better prices and cut special deals in multiple exchanges. 
This is the best way for a business to keep improving: innovate on the inside so when they need external innovation they're ready to go public. In fact they can keep charging their high rates and increase substantially their profit for a time until the market forces them to cut down prices.

I trust you're genuinelly curious and isn't just trolling me because I simply  believe on people. 
I'm trying to explain a escrow solution withou custom software (bitcoin contracts) and without a third party (which is how 100% of electronic transactions occur today).
Jack wants an item that amy sells. Jack doesn't trust seriousbtcescrow.com, doesn't trust his friend Mary that volunteered to escrow for them, doesn't trust paypal, doesn't trust dollars and he certainly doesn't trust Amy. Right now he has absolutely no options to buy it online. He can not buy it at all – or he could go to a slitgly convoluted but possible option. This may look hard because I'm explaining each step but suppose that it can be automated and made a lot easier by well written software.
Jack deposits 10 BTC on account A, 5 BTC on account B and Amy deposits 10 BTC on account C.
Accounts passwords are randomly generated and are, respectively: Kittens-Horses, Correct-Battery and Slot-Butter. The word "kittens" is sent to Jack and the word "horses" is sent to Amy. The same thing is done with all the other accounts.
Scenario 1: Jack receives the widget. He approves the transaction sends amy an email saying thank you amy and the words "kittens and slot". Now amy can use that password to withdraw her money from account A and C. Amy sends an email saying "You're welcome, battery!" and jack can get his deposit back by using the password correct-battery
Scenario 2: Jack isn't happy. While he doesn't send amy an email no one will ever be able to withdraw from the account and the money is lost. It doesn't stay with the escrow, it just stays forever in a bitcoin account. 
Some things you might not understand:
* There is no "collecting interest" in bitcoins, they either lose or gain value in dollars but 1 btc will always be 1btc.
* In this scenario the account isn't in any bank, it's just on the bitcoin blockchain and without the password it's lost forever.
* If bitcoins are lost you can say that all other bitcoins gain in value therefore all bitcoiners gain a little.
* Sure jack can send amy the password and she may not send him the password back: but that's why you automate such things and at some point you'll have to trust the code.
* If jack still doesn't like that option he can always not buy anything.

Sure Paypal could compete with BitPay, that's one scenario I outlined. But that would only worthwhile to PayPal if there's a large number of customers with Bitcoins burning a hole in their pocket. Currently this is not the case, at least not for now. There are many bitcoin users, but I would bet their number is pretty insignicant when we compare to the amount of credit cards that services like PayPal, Amazon or iTunes have registered.
So if Paypal moves now they have little to gain, percentage wise, and a lots to lose: if bitcoin crashes they will have their name associated with it, if they will be high valued targets for hackers etc.
I doubt Paypal is interest in holding bitcoins as a stock for their future value increase. They are not in the business of daytrading: do you see EBay announcing how much money they made by selling oil futures or shorting gold?

The china scenario is a very interesting one! It really depends on how much mining power is walled off and how effective the wall is. 
What would happen immediately is that the hash power of the network would go down but since it can take up to two weeks for the difficulty to adjust, then in practice blocks would take a lot longer to be found and transactions a lot longer to confirm. Because of that the time until an adjustment would also take longer so we could be up to four weeks in this slow schedule. 
If the mining power of china is low that would basically mean that they would be walled off bitcoins until a connection is reestablished. 
If the power was close to half on each side a very interesting race would occur. Suppose each half keeps mining normally and struggling to find blocks and include local transactions on them for a few hours. Because bitcoin nodes automatically switch to the longest chain this means that the minute someone crosses the border with a USB stick with a longer chain than the other side ALL transactions that happened in the smaller chain are reverted, as if they never occurred. All mined coins rewarded to the loser chain ceased to exist as if they were never connected to the real blockchain (because, technically, the weren't)
This creates two things: if you're not absolutely sure that the other side of the wall found less blocks than you then you're advised not to do any transactions. 
Secondly: since a guy with a USB or a ham radio can disrupt a huge number if transactions and decide who gets potentially millions in new coins then this longer blockchain  file is incredibly valuable. Which means that there's a huge incentive for people to break the wall, hich makes me think it would be very hard for china to do it.

Of course the more information is available about the market, the better informed people will be when deciding when to buy or sell. In that sense, every new information: an estimate on how many real people use bitcoin, what is the true market cap, who is using it, the velocity of money, all of those might influence the market one way or the other. But they all influence just two factors: the demand for coins and the true, liquid of coins on sale which is what really matters for the price.

I think you did a great job answering the questions but unfortunately she trapped you in an alley by asking the wrong questions, as it's the case. Most people start by asking who creates bitcoins, which leads to questions about the miners, then questions about the "solving a puzzle" which then leads to thinking this is all a big joke and who is backing and why does it have any value?
Whenever I explain to people I try to divert those questions into another area, more like:
'Bitcoins aren't a "thing" they are a big book of who gave money to whom and were the money went. To sync all those transactions a lot of computing power is required.. To reward the people who contribute to that computing power there's a "lottery" that gives new coins to the anyone who runs the computers who keep the network running.'
Using the idea of "lottery" explains better the purpose of the hashing than the "puzzle" in my opinion.

Don't preach. Talk about it when the topic is relevant like any other topic: if you invested in apple you shouldn't be trying to convince other people to switch to macs. 
It's a lose lose scenario: if they don't invest and the price rises they'll think you're just lucky or in a crazy pyramid scheme. If they buy and the price drops then they'll blame you for losing their money. If they win any money on it and don't understand it they'll might still lose it for a lack of security and still blame you.

The same way it has with gold since banking was invented.
Suppose you hold an account with mtGox: you're not holding these bitcoins you're trusting mtGox with your coins because you trust they will honor it and they provide you a service. Do you know how much bitcoins mtGox actually holds? They claim they don't do reserve banking but they also claimed in a recent reddit AMA that they hold 90% of all funds in cold storage, meaning that during most times less than 10% of all BTC is actually acessible by all users. 
This is of course a security measure and a good thing, but how do  actually know? Unless there's a bank run and everyone tries to cash out (or -god forbid!- there's some kind of government regulation going on that inspects it) no one can guarantee they aren't borrowing from that bitcoin pile. Of course mtGox could in theory publish their cold backup public adresses so everyone can verify they have the money they claim, but afaik no one is doing that voluntarily.

I believe one should never try to convince someone else into investing at anything because the golden rule of investing IMHO is to put money in things you understand and believe. You don't want to take the blame for a poor investment on someone else part.
If he believes in it, he'll put his money. You can't make him believe, you can only make him understand, and only if he is interested on it.
If you want to make him interested in it, then give him some. Print a nice looking paper wallet and put $100 (or whatever you think would make a nice gift). Don't print the value in dollars on the wallet, just teach him what it is, and how to figure out the price.
If he is interested in having more, he'll ask you about it. If he's not, you won't end up sounding like a door to door evangelical since all you did was give him one nice thing.

Two things I love: bitcoin and logical fallacies!
Circular logic/begging the question: all money is state backed, bitcoin is not therefore bitcoin will fail. You can't use your premise as your argument: you have to argue why state money will always win. 
Historical fallacy: money has always been his way therefore it cannot be any other way.
I doubt the notion that most money in history was state backed (gold and silver coins, private banknotes etc) but even if it is this isn't an argument. A lot of things have never been done before and are successfully done. 
Right wing money: this is ad hominem attack. Who cares if the money is left or right wing, money doesn't have a political affiliation and this isn't an argument. 
The remaining arguments are about stability and "what backs this value" which has been written a hundred times already.

Because a brainwallet is just a password. Passwords are usually hidden behind a server that has to be hacked, tied to an account which can have other security measures on top of it and then you usually you have to hack some other obstacles to access the funds. If you have a bad password you're relatively safe until a lot of other things get hacked. And if your email or facebook password gets hacked, they still have to do something to get their money.
In a brainwallet, anyone that downloads the blockchain can bruteforce all the accounts there. I can guarantee you there must be, right now, thousands of bots constantly perusing the blockchain looking for weak brainwallets or private keys generated from a client with a flawed implementation. They can do it offline, limitlessly, constantly, they can prioritize high balance accounts. They can use old mining rigs that became obsolete – if it guesses one wallet every month it can cash out instantly. 
If you have a bad brainwallet or a guessable private key, you will be stolen.

Well most assets can't be truly transferable digitally. Bitcoin can only transfer bitcoins which is kind of redundant since transferring bitcoins is why it was made for. 
In the same manner, Ripple can transfer ripples which isn't a very interesting currency right now because of the central control, but Ripple is more than the ripples. 
Remember, most exchanges work on proprietary closed softwares and all of them use a private centrally controlled database of credit. The same applies to all ecommerce sites even the ones who accept bitcoin. When you buy anything or convert bitcoins to credit, once the bitcoin is out of your wallet all you have is promise from someone in some server.  Ripple could be a vast improvement over that.
Of course there are ways of implementing digital ownership and open transactions using bitcoins but, like Ripple, they're under development. 
I'm not a bitcoiner or a rippler fan, I'm  a fan of developing technologies and I really think people shouldn't call them scams until they ship.

Yes, you're not going to brute force all of them, but what many people would consider "safe", like a phrase of a few dictionary words, a sentence from some best selling book, is breakable. It doesn't need to be incredibly profitable, but it doens't require an investment like mining does and if you stumble upon 5 btcs like in OP's post, then someone will do.

1) as soon as you exchange it move your funds to a local wallet you control
2) if you don't plan on moving your funds around then move part of them to a paper wallet or a USB key that has never been online

Saying that a company is too expensive is very different than accusing them of being dishonest. I saw nothing dishonest about that contract and I'm downvoting you for it. If your post had said "beware of robocoin contract and fees!" or "attention: robocoin fees are very high and competitors are better" then you'd be in the right.
If the company is charging too much, then that's a problem between the company and potential buyers to decide.

Inflation happens when the government adds more dollars to the total dollar supply yes, but it only affects prices when they add it to their side. If there is a trillion dollars around and the government creates another trillion, then everyone's else's money is worth less. If instead, the us government decided to issue a new dollar, where each old dollar is worth a million new dollars, inflation would not be affected, you wouldn't become richer or poorer, just your base currency mumber would change.

I any speak for other countries but among Brazil many problems, government control of the economy  isn't one that most people care about. There's no libertarian tradition, "right wing" is mostly associated with military coups and privatizing public companies and has a bad rep, and I doubt most people even realize that there could be such a thing as a country without a central bank. 
Protests are in a consensus  asking government to use the tax money and oil royalties into more public transportation, public health, public education and expansion of social welfare — I haven't seen a single poster asking for less government. Less government spending with salaries but never less Government  If this was the early nineties however (ultra inflation, weak economy, weaker currency), bitcoin would be soaring.

Sure if you want to move money around, create multiple adresses and spend them a paper wallet isn't very practical. If you want to keep a portion of your money safe, completely offline and safe then your best options are exactly as you said: plug your computer off, save your private key in an offline media and don't ever allow it to touch the Internet again. Your encrypted wallet on a cloud service is relatively safe but cloud services can be compromised, files te corrupt and encryption passwords can be keylogged.
Then it's a choice of choosing a media for saving your private keys. Paper is a surprisingly reliable option: it can survive  centuries, won't demagnetize, won't scratch, wont become obsolete and can be made waterproof. Do you still have any digital files from 10 in a USB or CD? What about 15, 20 years? You also have many other important papers (birth certificate, passport, diplomas) that you keep around in a folder somewhere so you already know how to keep paper safe and not misplace it.
The only risk of a paper wallet then really is if you lose all your documents in a house fire or something like that, but that's why you should keep a backup in a trusted persons house.

They don't look bad at all! Are those laser printed or what?
Just remember that when you give a coin to someone, they are as worth as they can trust you, since you could, in theory withdraw all te balance at any moment, or if you keep the private keys on a unsafe computer they could be stolen and all your coins will be worth zero. 
If you're using them just as a conversation starter here's an idea: Print an expiration date on them, like "valid until Nov 2015" on each batch. So you can give them away freely to anyone but if they lose the coins or throw it away, you can still redeem hte same value in the future and print new coins to gift someone who cares. 
That way the fact you keep the private keys is a feature, not a liability.

Lets create an email service with offline accounts where you don't need to register before receiving emails! 
Here's how it works, you can make up any email address on the fly, let's say tom and give it to people. To later check your mail the password is just your username reversed, in this case username Tom82, password 28MOT. 
But Avsa, that's stupid as anyone can guess everyone else's password!
I guess you're right. So lets reverse the process: first you think a passphrase ("janitors obey nobody!") and then you have to calculate the username: well get the first letter of every three and then do a sum of  the value of each letter. In the above example the email is Tom325
We just created a system where you can invent offline email addresses: you make them up on the fly and nobody knows they even exist. The system also never stores any email until the account receives the first message. No, it's not very secure: you can probably use a computer to generate a valid password for any email account, so you would want a even more complicated algorithm for generating passwords and accounts, but you understand the process. 
Bitcoin is a bit like that, but you're sending coins instead of emails.

I'm a user of both and looking at this thread its the "RIPPLE IS A SCAM" people that are making the biggest noise. 
Having competition is good: personally I love seeing both compete on features, philosophy and even the way it's built. Here's how I would describe them: bitcoin is a 0 trust currency - you don't need to trust anyone, not  the miners, not the merchants, not the developers, not even the unknown creator. Ripple uses trust as the currency: you trade trust among friends, you deposit or remove trust on the validators of the network, the very foundation funds itself by the trust you might have on them in the future.

Bitcoin is suffering from the same thing that most open source software has: as soon as something is technically possible by a geek the priority changes and they work on other "more important" feature. Most open source projects see design as an afterthought, just a nice coat of paint, and thus lack user experience, user testing, usability etc. 
The most usable apps and beautiful I've seen are usually made by small teams working full time on either a startup or a paid app. BTC can't have that. 
A wallet require a high level of trust, so most of them are open source. The technical skills necessary are very high (the whole system can fall apart if you choose the wrong random number generator or the wrong variation of a variation of a encryption method) so it's hard to find a small multidisciplinary team. 
I don't know how to solve that. Maybe rich bitcoiners could fund small teams to work on those features for their own benefit (dpr would be better off had he done this), maybe venture capitalists find a way to bet on small bitcoin teams, maybe someone makes a open source system that pays developers for each git branch, maybe the bitcoin foundation focuses on working more on high level SDKs that allows small teams to build more usable software.

While I agree with point 2 and 3, for the first one I would like to point that almost all digital money (except cryptocurrencies) are IOUs in a way. Your money (both in dollars and bitcoins) in mt gox is just a promise from mt gox to honor that number, so with any other exchange. Bitpay issues IOUs for their merchants, money in eBay is an IOU, your amazon credits also. In fact the money in your bank account is an IOU and any other one that's not under your mattress. 
Ripple could eliminate much of the attrition in between all those virtual wallets; you could use the credit in your mtGox to pay for something in amazon or think geek, it could be a very useful payment system. 
But in order to do that they have to release the server code and be transparent and quick in how they plan to distribute XRP

The only way I see this happening is if the buyer has an app that creates a new address for each transaction, but since he already has an app why not use to send the funds?
One advantage is that if you print multiple paper wallets with fixed denomination, the cashier can import the keys and make a transaction immediately, so the customer doesn't need to wait for any confirmations. 
It's an interesting but long process and unless ATM machines that print fixed denomination bills become common, it's highly impractical. 
But you're correct: never ever share a private key for an address  you don't want to empty.

I believe you are misunderstanding how bitcoins work, which is natural as it's a complex system. 
But the coins themselves are not contained inside the block. The blockchain doesn't keep any identifying information about the computers who own each coin. There's only a single proof of ownership: the private key. Of you have that code, then you can move the funds elsewhere, if you don't then they won't be moved. That key isn't contained inside the blockchain, otherwise anyone would be able to claim it!

I don't see how companies would cease to exist because of deflation. I understand the common idea, but I just can't see it as science, just common economic theory. 
If my money under my mattress grows at an stable rate, so does everyone's money, and if that's the case everyone's  purchasing power will be the same. if everyone expect money to be worth more in the future, prices just adjust to it. If someone can invest in something and double my return rate, he will do it and therefore companies keep getting investors.
Let's do a a mental exercise and create a currency with stable 1% a year of return for everyone. What happens, is that since everyone is getting the same % then the value of total money doesn't actually change, we're just adding zeros. In order to create inflation you have to give  different returns to different people, for your money to be devalued, someone must be getting more value out of it. Do you tax people whose money is not moving, maybe by randomly eroding coins from any wallet that hasn't moved? You can't do that without violating the privacy of the owners, otherwise people would just keep moving their own money around. Do you reward the miners? That's just describing bitcoin.
The problem is, you can't have inflation withou a government creating valuable money by diluting the value of others, inflation is the government saying, you better put your money in banks or I'll take it away!

Those are directly related: people treat it as if it was te same scenario as today but they are very different. It was very hard to buy and sell bitcoins back then if you didn't know anyone in the scene or wasn't in a handful of countries who had good services. In 2009 bitcoin was just a weird idea with a handful of services. Also, keeping bitcoins for so long isn't that easy as it sounds: most services  were hacked in the past four years at some point, there wasn't as many options of storing, most people weren't aware of the proper way to keep them, and a lot of people have simply lost their wallet files. 
For example in 2010 or 2011 NPR's planet money did a pretty good program on bitcoin. Had you bought them at the time they were still under $30, but had you bought them by getting the program advice you'd probably use a service called mywallet.com which a few months later was hacked/shut down/owner ran with everyone's money. 
And this was many years after it was created. I might be wrong but I believe on early 2009 the only options you had to buy bitcoin were by giving money to a friend who had them. He probably had mined using a buggy command line only software and you two had agreed to the price randomly based on a few forum posts since there wasn't a single trusted source of info in the current price.

I think the mix of Byzantine generals with CPU power and wifi passwords made the metaphor a bit confusing. Let me try:
A large number of Byzantine generals are surrounding the walls of Constantinople. If they can overpower the king only if the majority of them can coordinate a time and place, but that's complicated since they refuse to take orders from others, cannot all meet in the same place, the communication is slow and unreliable and there's always the risk of double agents intercepting and faking the letters. 
The solution is that all letters are to be written with very precise rules: they have to write in sonnets, with all words starting in alphabetical orders, they also must be palindromes and a bunch of other rules that vary according the weekday, weather and last received letter. This means that the messages take a a few hours  to be composed  even with their best scribes and that they can't start writing beforehand. 
So a general decides to attack on a given hour and asks his scribes to start composing the letter. After a few hours they copy the text in a dozen letters and send them to all other generals. 
As soon as a general receives any communication they must write back a reply to all generals, appending the original text and further composing their own poems. If a general receives more than one letter, they must ignore the shorter ones and append the longest. The process is repeated multiple times: they receive letters, if its a longer chain than the ones they signed they take a few hours appending and writing back. 
At some point the chain letter will be multiple pages of a very hard to compose poetry, detailing the time and details of the attack. It's easy to check if all texts conform to the rules, but its very hard to fake an entire chain as it would take more man hours than any single general (or the king) had. So all generals can coordinate their movements by consent without any one of them being able to overrun the others. 
So there's the solution to the Byzantine general problem. Its not a very practical one to actual generals but it can be done with computers. The generals are bitcoin miners, the palindromic alphabetic sonnets are hash functions and the orders are the bitcoin transactions.

Apple isn't valuable because it's all hype and marketing. It's because they have products that work well. 
Jobs wasn't a marketing genius, he was a guy who knew how to put great people working together into a great vision. 
You know why there are so many great proprietary software that looks and works great and so many shitty open source software? Because software that makes money is able to support a paid team. Do you know why startups attract millions of dollar in investment? Because people believe they can make billions from the shares of the company. 
So I would say if you want for bitcoin to succeed you could start by dropping that idea that ripple is a premined scam. I've seen similar claims about mastercoin and about any creator of cryptocoins, satoshi included (oh it must be bad because the creator made money!)
Things that make money for their creators are things that have teams of talented people working on them, if ripple, mastercoin or litecoin  succeeds I see no reason why their creators shouldn't become billionaires: this exact possibility is what why their founders and team is working so hard at making it succeed.

The 80% number is how many the foundation wants to give away, its my understanding that they will keep 20% to themselves to find further development. 
The last article I read estimated that just the original bitcoin mining machine mined at least 1 million coins that were never spent, that's 10% of all coins. Whoever is behind satoshi could as easily have mined another million in other wallets just by being among the first miners. 
The only difference is that mining is an essential part of the bitcoin protocol while ripple was built in such a way that the energy spent in mining is unnecessary. They could (they still can) have set up a system where the do a simulacrum of mining and coins are given as lottery proportionally to CPU of the early adopters - would that make it any more fair? Both systems are just arbitrary. 
Here's how I see it: they created a system where mining is unnecessary and haven't figured out how to fairly distribute coins. It's a big problem an like all other big issues if they don't solve it right ripple won't catch on (no one is being forced to).

This is why it hasn't been lifted yet. Developers are trying multiple methods to circumvent the problem and pruning the block chain.


Miners will always run full nodes and there will be always people and corporations (specially bitcoin related) doing it so. AFAIK running a full note is basically a vote for the new codebase of protocol, every time you run a full node and update your software to a given version you are accepting that new change, usually a small change like a new method to prune or up the block size limit. As in any democracy, more votes is better, but it's not necessary for everyone or even more than half of the people to vote. Also, if some very controversial issue arises, more people can decide to run a full node, and if even that issue cannot be decided what will happen is that the blockchain will be forked. But that would be an extreme case, like a peaceful civil war were everyone who didn't like the new laws simply declared a new country.


You can accept transactions of low volume with zero confirmations, there are also other ways to solve it like green addresses and off chain transactions, but I personally think that simply accepting a zero confirmation is already low risk.


People who want to hide their money would not use a single address and would try to mix their transactions. But as was said in the senate by the FBI lady (I think) "cash is still the preferred way to launder money" and "criminals usually prefer to take their money to centralized issuers in countries that they believe will look the other way"


There are very cool ways to use bitcoin to automate money. This is very easily done by simply putting money into a an address and giving the private key to someone: now you are in a situation where the person among you that takes the money out of there first, keeps it. You can even create two transactions, the second one only redeemable in the future, so the first person has an advantage.


Well, lending will have to adapt itself to this, by using smart property, a way where objects know who their real owner is and only accept orders from them. You can create smart properties in such way that I lend you money with your car as an collateral. You, me and the car, sign a contract stating that if you fail to send X amount of money until a given date, the car will automatically drive itself to the new owner. Less risk for lender means probably less interests for borrower.


Who knows how the protocol will evolve, but I just hope it stays open and decentralized.

There's a lot of misinformation here, so I'll repost something I just commented on another post. Yes, its possible to loan bitcoins, and they work even better that way. Sure, the price of the coin can vary but that's included on the description below.
Read up a bit on **smart property** and talks by **Mike Hearn**. Bitcoin technology could really help improve loans to reduce risks, increase competition and therefore reduce interest.
1) Bob owns an object that understand smart property. It means that you bought it with bitcoins, and the change of ownership was recorded in the blockchain, in such way that the object itself understand you are his new owner: maybe it's a computer or smartphone that will only decrypt for someone who can prove ownership of a given private key, or a door that will only unlock for it's owner, or maybe a vehicle that will only accept orders from it's owner and is able to drive itself to a new location.
2) Bob needs some cash, maybe to pay for this new fancy smart object he just bought, or maybe to pay for another project of his own. Alice has money and is willing to lend it to bob for some interest.
3) Alice gives the money to Bob and they sign a digital contract saying Bob has X months to pay back the money, in such and such conditions and with such and such number of payments. He offers his smart object as a collateral for the loan and it is included on the contract. This contract is an independent computer program that has multiple inputs: Bob's signature, Alice's signature, the Object's signature, payments, time and maybe a given bit coin exchange rate (so it accounts for volatility and can add some custom triggers in extreme cases), and based on those variables it will do one of these scenarios.
4a) After some time Bob pays back the amounts he owes with interest. All conditions are met and the contract is now null, so he retains back all ownership of the object, and Alice has now more bitcoins than she had before.
4b) Bob isn't able to meet all the conditions of the loan. The contract knows this, and contacts his smart object which now automatically changes it's ownership to either Alice or a middle man that will renegotiate with Bob. If it's a computer, it will now refuse to work for Bob, if it's a car it will drive itself to a new parking lot, if it's a door it will not open for Bob anymore. 
In all cases, notice that everyone got what they wanted. In either way Bob got his money to do what he wanted. If what Bob tried to accomplish fails he loses his car/computer/house but that's exactly what he willingly signed for, but he knows he will not be in debt  or suffer long term effects of failing to pay. In either way Alice gets either her money or the car/computer/house back, which may or may not be the same value, but again that's what she also willingly signed for. She doesn't even need to go collect it in person, she can simply resell the object on the block chain and allow the new owner to claim it from Bob (if the object cannot move by itself).
Everyone knows exactly their risks and consequences. No lawyer, police, banker or thug needs to be involved. Since it's all in the network the contract will be enforced no matter what. Since Alice doesn't need to do anything to get her money or collateral back, she doesn't need to be even in the same country: meaning that Bob can choose the lender that will give him, literally, the most favourable rate **in the world**. Everyone wins. Except, of course, bankers,  lawyers and thugs.

Thanks, I've been following this idea very closely. It's a hard complex but once you understand it, it makes a lot of sense.
I just don't get one thing? Do you plan to make it functional at some point in the near future? Because you mention "open an account", "make a post" etc, but I didn't see any buttons or links to do that. As far as I could tell, it's a site trying to explain a complex idea that is just on the conceptual stage.
If you already have a working system in place then, don't take it personally, but you're going the wrong way at it. If you want people to post items, you should put the focus on that. Instead of spending so many words explaining it, I would start with the premise.
I don't want to be an nosy, but here's how I would do it:
NashX is a trust-free system that allows you to buy anything online anonimously and without middle men, even if you don't trust the other party. Using NashX, both parties set up a guarantee fund in such way that both will have more to lose by being dishonest. (of course, the text could change)
POST AN OFFER NOW (big button, with call to action. Maybe add a "no registration needed" or something similar)
Latest Offers:
* Bob wants to sell his he-man action figure. Value: $1, risked funds $10.
* Alice wants to sell her alpaca socks. Value $20, risked funds $25
* See more
Then add two or three common questions like: How does nashX works exactly?
Explain in two sentences, refer to the FAQ. Don't put too much text, otherwise you make an otherwise complicated subject seems even more daunting.
Also: get a new site look. If you don't have a designer, buy a theme from [theme forest for $15]( (I'm not afiliated to them) and you'll look a dozen times more trustworthy. And drop the video: I know it was probably hard to make, but it's too amateurish...
Hope I was too forward, but that's what I do for a living and wanted to help you a little bit.

Probably the best places for them to put machines would be in international airports. Everyone is looking for ways to get rid of local currencies, exposure to lots of travelers and airplanes rides are short enough for the exchange value to remain constant. For many it would be a way to exchange dollars to euros (or whatever) cheaply. If it printed a paper wallet you wouldn't even need a smartphone.
Bitcoins would simply mean for many people a voucher for exchanging "real money" across borders. The next logical step would be to install them in hotels and near where travelers are, so they don't need to exchange it at the airport. At some point the hotel could start accepting Bitcoins directly and then it's mainstream..

Suppose OpenCoin announces that it will distribute ripples for free to anyone who can prove to be a real person - like a facebook identity or an active reddit user, would that be fair? Suppose opencoin decides that it will give it away in a lottery, based on the computing power of your machine, would that be fairer?
I assume that this whole "OpenCoin owns all the coins" is simply because Open Coin hasn't announced yet how they will be distributed - because they didn't figure it out yet.

This seems like a very bad solution: if bitcoin prices rises dramatically again then the bitcoin price of a colored coin can be a significant cost. Sound like bleaching dollar bills to use it to issue an IOU, it can be done but its not cost effective. 
Also, one of the big advantages of colored coins is to make dollar-BTC exchange more decentralized: exchanges could simply credit people with colored coins worth the dollar amount they deposited and then they could exchange it on the free market: you'd be  giving significant bitcoin value using a fixed exchange rate. 
Colored coins are useful if the cost of producing one is insignificant for the issuer. 
Can you give transaction fees that are worth more than the bitcoins being passed? If I  send 100 colored  satoshis and pay a transaction fee of 1 non colored milibitcoin, will my transaction be accepted by miners?

The most interesting part is that in this scenario the guy who didn't believe in bitcoin had no way to lose. Here's how this could work:
There are two groups of people: conservador bears who believe bitcoin will go down and want to keep their money, and risk taking bulls, who want to bet on bitcoin rising. 
So everyone buys a fixed amount of bitcoins and it goes in one pile. If bitcoin ends up falling then the bulls money is used to pay the bears their original value in fiat, so depending on how big the bull pile is their money is insured up to 100%. If bitcoin goes up then a small part of pile is used to pay back the conservative bears the same amount of money back, and the rest goes to bulls which multiplies their winnings. 
In this scenario the more people are betting on bitcoin falling then the bigger is the reward for those betting on it rising, attracting more bulls. And the more people betting in bitcoin rising then the bigger is the insurance pile for bears, and the safer their money is from big falls. 
Setting this up removes the problem of stability for those who don't want it and increases rewards for those who want risk. Everyone wins!
 I'm pretty sure this already has a name in financing and were reinventing the wheel.

Ripple labs recently announced they were using a model similar to bitcoin mining to distribute xrps by using "proof of useful work" essentially giving away xrps for people who donate computing power to one specific cloud computing research group. Like many things from open coin, it's a neat idea implemente in a centralized way and I started thinking how this could be implemented in bitcoin in a decentralized shape. 
There could be even three players: people wanting to give CPU/GPU/memory in exchange for bitcoins, companies and universities needing that power and a third group donating bitcoins to research they wanted to fund.

No, thank you for the great story!
Now some more ideas I had:
* Don’t teach them to day trade. With grown ups it’s already a very ridiculous gamble and I don’t think kids should try to play “predict the bubble” at all. 
* Instead, he was right in thinking of it as a stock: the answer of “will apple stocks rise” is related to “will Apple the company grow” and it’s based on things he can relate to: Is this year’s iPad as cool as it was last year? Are your friends wanting iPods for christmas, or do they prefer XBOXs and PS4s? Based on what his friends are into, will Microsoft, Sony or Nintendo grow? So if he asks you “will bitcoin price go up or down in the future”, ask him “based on what you understand about it, do you still believe bitcoin will be more useful than it’s alternatives in the future?
* Bitcoin is complex but the more interesting things I learned about them are about economics: what makes the dollar worth? Is it based on gold? Why is gold valuable
* I believe the best way to introduce the craziness of money to kids is to tell about the [Giant Stone Coins of Yap]( which at first looks like a crazy unpractical system, but after you think about it it’s actually a much saner system than the ones we have.
* If you want to explain Cryptography, I think [this is the best explanation]( I ever saw of public key cryptography: it uses a metaphor of color paints to explain something much harder
* If you want to go into math of hashing, here’s a simple example of an asymmetrical operation: A and B are both primes and less than 100, and A x B = 3149. Now imagine you ask everyone to figure out A and B and the first one gets a reward. It’s a hard work of repetitive operations (even with a calculator!), but if anyone finds it out they’re 47 and 67, anyone can quickly verify. Now give a reward to the first person: you just figured out mining by hand (using a different algorithm, of course)
Of course, those are too many topics to go in one session, but anyone individually is easy for any kid to grasp, specially one smart like him. I would take some time to explain each topic to him and go through what it meant (it’s your private crash course on history of economics!), and then let him pick out what he wants to talk about. As a plus, get him to ask questions and give away his microbitcoins as reward, plus a few for everyone who attends, and bingo, you have a micro economy running.
Extra: add all the microbitcoins public addresses as watch only addresses to a blockchain.info wallet, with email backups: that way, if anyone imports one of the private keys and moves the values around, a notice will be sent by email. Boom, you have a secure, decentralized currency system far superior than any “school cupom system” the school could come up after a ten thousand dollar investment..

They are probably talking about Mercado Bitcoin. It's not a "fund" and it never promised any return to anyone. It's just an exchange, (the only exchange in Brazil AFAIK).
Other than that, no glaring errors, but nothing new. They spend a lot of time explaining the basics, which is always needed in an introductory article, but adds nothing new, really. How is the state of bitcoin in brazil? Did they talk to a brazilian lawyer to give an opinion on how the national regulations might affect it? Did they reach some government representative to get his opinion? 
Seems to me that Exame just spoke to two bitcoin enthusiasts and lifted the rest from the internet..

In practice it doesn't matter. The value of the coins today is based on how many people are wanting to buy them vs how many coins are being put in the market. Coins that are not on the market, either lost or being held aren't factored in.
Here's a way to think about it: if someone today decides he wants to cash a 5000 coins, the price would feel a push downwards. Every day that million dollar isn't cashed out, that's one less push downwards. If these coins are lost, that day will never come. Repeat the process over for each block of untouched 5000 coins.

3) If the private key was in his home and police found no evidence linking him to the DPR in his house, then he has a nice defense to base on..

It's a natural thing about a growing market: in expanding markets there is usually lower volumens, high barriers to entry and bigger profits. In mature markets it's easier to buy and sell, but the profit margins are thin.
I've heard that during the 90's when ex-soviet republics were opening up to the west, one could walk in with a bag full of used jeans and make a small fortune that would pay for his whole trip. After some time, when brand stores opened this market went away, but it existed for a time frame.

@_date: 2013-04-18 16:17:27
Of course it allows: the fees are in the redeemability of the money. MtGox could give you 99 cents for every mtgox dollar you redeem, and can give you $0.99 credit for every dollar you put in their system.
The exchange part is just a problem of information. Buyers need a way to advertise how much they are willing to pay for and sellers idem, but this doesn't need to be in MtGox servers. I'm aware that there's also a P2P protocol that needs to be in place so that you can initiate an open ended transaction and wait until someone wants to accept your offer.
Also, the actual transaction is not going to happen on the classified site, it happens on your client, so there's no lag: if you put up an offer for X the trade can only happen if you allow it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:24:38
My point is that if the problem are exchanges and charts, then everyone should contact their preferred service and ask them to add the options. If a merchant is using fractions, email him and let him know. If no one listens, we build those things ourselves.

I'm not saying it doesn't matter: the price of bitcoin is in a way a reflection of how much the market trusts and values the system. 
But if you are a believer in bitcoin you should emphasise to other people not the dollar value, but the technological value: what does it really brings to the table? How is it superior to other electronic money? That's what will make it stick on the long run
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:01:59
This argument is constantly made  and I think it's a fallacy and here's why: 
When you deal with large quantities of money, any small percentage will look huge. Paying thousands of dollars for anything seems large, but if you are dealing with millions being transacted, it's not as significant. I suppose if all Subway franchises changed their brand of toilet paper or added 1mg of wheat less in some bun we would be talking about tens of thousands of dollars in difference: you have to consider what would that change also mean.
You can't really compare a 1% fee cost with bitcoin because it's value varies by that much in less than 10 minutes! So if all Subway franchises accepted bitcoin, and the value dropped, in 30 days from $750 to $730, then the bitcoin community would be cheering about stability while these franchises would have lost tens of thousands of dollars.

1. Code: bitcoin isn't one software is a protocol. And there are a lot of smart people helping write it.
2. Exploits. The reward works both ways: by rewarding exploits the system is constantly under attack. This also makes it resilient as there are many very smart people taking a look at that code. See 1.
3. Government. This is the biggest thread. The trend in the US has been positivie, with endorsement from many politicians. If bitcoin finds one good safe haven in a big country like the US, then it can survive in the other countries. As more legitimate business adopt it, there's more incentive to keep it legal.
4. Corporate sabotage. Corporations can't kill an idea. They can try to sabotage bitcoin, but see 1 and 2: there are a lot of people activelly trying to defend it. The music and movie industry also wishes P2P never existed and look how far that took them.
5. Fundamentals. This is the stronger point of them all. Also see 1, 2, 3 and 4: there are many smart people behind bitcoins, and they all have a financial incentive on working around those issues.
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:16:17
I think one huge way on which you could legitimize this as helpin the content creator (instead of just feeding the black market) would be invert and put torrent hashes in the blockchain instead of bitcoin addresses in torrents. 
The idea is that by putting a hash in a bitcoin address, you're effectively proving without a shadow of doubt you had access to that file before anyone and before it was made public so when you send money to that address you know you're sending it to the content creator. 
This creates an incentive for content creators to deliver it first in this protocol. There must be a clever way also to differentiate works that were already public: for example you need a minimum amount of time being the only person with that torrent to prove that the file didn't simply "leak" or was public already: for example I expect dozens of hashes for Star Wars to appear in the same day, and therefore none of them era credit as "creator"..

Yes, you can do that with Bitcoin contracts (but I don't think they're implemented yet), you can also probably do it the way Blockchain.info does which is some sort of client side decryption magic, or finally you can simply use the exchange as a mediator between two accounts. In any case you would still be needed to sign on in order to authorize the order, which takes away the automation and speed that some people like.
There are also [some great ideas here]( on how to make a decentralized exchange using a social graph.
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:55:16
Yes but you can't plot this against price, you have to measure against bitcoin adoption which is harder to measure. 
Maybe compare number of mtGox accounts or number of blockchain wallets vs the price and you can see how much of it is pure speculation and how much is real usage

Also, has she moved her stuff completely and has her landlord already already replaced the renter? Because otherwise I would say she wasn't forced to move to a crackhouse, she decided to spend a few days there voluntarily for her article..

Fellow brazilian. I agree, I'm a fan of Bitcoins but here's why I doubt it will grow in Brazil before anywhere else:
1) Inflation isn't a big problem. Recently we've had some of it, but it's not the crazy hyperinflation of the early 90's
2) Currency manipulation/exchange isn't a big issue. You can change dollars freely. This isn't argentina or venezuela.
3) Brazil never had a libertarian history. I've never heard any politician debating against the central bank – I mean most at some point disagree with what the central bank does, but I never heard anyone claiming it should not exist.
4) The protests aren't against corruption and government overspending in stadiums and underspending in health and education. Bitcoin doens't solve those. Notice: while everyone is complaining of the cost of the world cup, most people I know wish the government spent that same money elsewhere (health and education). This isn't a big government issue, it's a bad government issue.
5) While taxes are excessive, most people I know want reduced taxes and aren't fans of people who skip on their taxes. If bitcoin is seen as a way not to pay taxes it will get a bad rep in Brazil..

Most bitcoiners are bitcoin users because they think current wallets are already usable, so it's not a great selling point. Of course there's lots of people that haven't used a wallet before that your low barrier of entry might be great but they don't dream about bitcoin wallets so your tag line keeps them away.
