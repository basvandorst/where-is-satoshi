This was predicted back in 2016 and a lot of people doubted it. People didn't even look into it. Now entire world is after bitcoin. It's best to do research and be open minded about certain things. I just wanted to share this to let the community know about this. Hope you guys get motivation from this ����

Mining Bitcoins is not as profitable as it was, Unless you are a investor with huge investing power that's able to not only invest in the technology part but also able to harvest the solar energy that will be used to fire up the machines. Than it will be a profitable investment!
