Nonsense, economies are not a zero sum game.  To make my point simple to digest I offer the following.
Peter and Paul sell apples and oranges at the market, in a world where only 10 sea shells (money)exist.  Jane has a coconut tree and would like to sell too.  So would Mike who has melons.  Where does the $ for these transactions come from?  What would be cool is if someone came up with a way to make more sea shells to exchange for these goods?  Why would the shells be worth any less if there is economic development and demand for the new products to match?  Fractional reserve lending while being the source of many conspiracy theories is the most ingenious method I've ever heard of for supporting economic growth.  That said, there are a ton of flaws with the system, but YouTube videos about the evil federal reserve aren't doing anything but muddying the waters and confusing people who don't understand that controling the growth of an economy is a little different from sitting at the dinner table hammering out a household budget.

Nature's never changed, humans have deviated.  Though it seems you would agree a merit based system is what is needed.

Shit, you don't even have to go to darknet.  You'd be surprised what is being sold openly on places like Alibaba and Indiamart, many even offering "discreet" shipping.  These fuckers can't contain us anymore.

Why would anyone be forced to carry credit cards?  I have cards attached to multiple accounts and beyond a bit of overdraft protection, there is no credit involved.

You'll need one to rent cars as well, but my impression was that he was implying that the German government would be forcing people to use credit cards by eliminating cash.  Was simply pointing out that there are other cashless options.  Wouldn't ever want to be without credit cards personally.

@ 40 I would pick up at least 100.
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:44:38
Yeah, cuz with the steady increase in transaction volume, it's definitely going to zero by the end of the year.

Ex convict here, can confirm.  Spent the better part of 4 years in an economy that used postage stamps as money.

This.  I use Turo when I want to drive something stupid.  You get the awesome newness without the disappointment of having to keep paying when it becomes no big deal.

In most cases I would call you a idiot, but i believe The Fed will be hiking rates and we're going to begin seeing a pretty serious contraction by mid 2020.

That's state; he's talking federal.  He's correct.

Not to be negative, but nearly unlimited upside is also a selling point for a lot of worthless penny stocks.  
That said I do see a lot more value in bitcoin and will almost certainly be investing.  One more thing; you mention the possibility of another currency fixing a "fatal flaw".  If there is one with Bitcoin, what is it?
@_date: 2018-07-07 11:32:57
Cool story bro.
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:12:57
Thanks, appreciate the input.  I'm here for due diligence before dumping some money into it and it's refreshing to deal with grown ups who don't get defensive and snotty about my questions.  As I've mentioned elsewhere, inviting the scrutiny and answering the tough questions is the only way the Bitcoin community will ever attract serious investors.   
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:26:51
Thanks a lot.  This was very informative, honest and presented some things I hadn't considered.  I appreciate your time.  Shit, have a lot more reading to do now.  
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:47:17
Sorry, my question is poorly worded.  I was more speaking for myself and associates who already have the app on our phones.
@_date: 2015-09-28 04:25:39
Relevant as fuck right there; have an upvote.
@_date: 2015-04-15 09:10:17
No, I used it today.   It's free for personal use and the money is there now; I think you read about the "Pro" version which is just a business payment processing system.

@_date: 2015-04-15 17:06:36
Perfect, thanks.  I'm here for purposes of due diligence, but have often run into people who are very defensive about Bitcoin and it's weaknesses; I appreciate your honesty.  I don't understand how some others here can expect the world to jump on the Bitcoin train while many in the community, not only don't want to discuss potential risks, but become angry or defensive when others probe.  The community should learn to welcome scrutiny, because it's the only way real investors will get on board.
@_date: 2018-07-07 01:07:03
Sounds like sour grapes.  Wonder why.
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:52:33
I understand it's not available in other countries.  But again back to my original premise; I'm talking about myself and my circle who already have the app on our phones.  There is nothing (other than data charges) that would prevent me from using this or a similar app anywhere in the world, so long as service is available.

Why would Squarecash not work internationally?
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:30:02
Serious question here guys; I'm not rich or anything, but I am a business man and make decent money.   I have no reason to ever want to hide or obscure anything I am doing financially.  A very close circle of people I'm involved with, all move money to and from each other using Square Cash (myself included).  Shit is free, and super easy.  
That said, what is the benefit of Bitcoin for people like us?  Again I'm not here to stir up shit or ruffle feathers I'm  genuine in the asking here.  Thanks  in advance.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:27:05
Yeah but $.05.
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:45:26
Cool, thanks for the info man.
@_date: 2018-07-06 18:48:25
I will buy @ 3.5-3.9k, and sell @ 19.9k before mid 2019.
