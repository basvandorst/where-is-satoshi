yeah again my bad man, I really did not mean anything by what I was saying. I was pointing it out that I had to look up what that acronym meant and understood(inflation).


So easy when it's handed to you like candy out of high school.(credit cards)




When I think about investments I think you need to have some money like $10K or something on the side. I'm not at that stage myself, but I'm about to be a full time web developer/freelance on the side/hopefully in time I'll get out of debt/start saving/get to that point.
I see your point in the spreadsheet too, I mean $2,500 is not much(to me it is, I don't even have that after taxes/debt settlement obliterated my savings)
But I also think I want to live in the moment/young... but as mentioned I'll get old too, so do both right... think about the inevitable(old).


I get that man. That's why I'm on the side of "build SaSS products" businesses/develop content(youtube videos or whatever)/blogs/publish books that sort of thing. Also just be skilled so you're worth something. Live within your means.
Once I get out of this rut that I've been in I fucking hope I don't forget how retarded I was/still am.


yeah that's the plan man, save months/year(s) of living expenses. Currently as a single person I can survive on like $10-$20k/year but I f'd myself with school/credit cards/phone... My school loans accrue like $2-3K per year... they're on hold for now... but man. In the grand scheme my price tag of $50K roughly is not much but yeah... will take a little time.
People tell you too like "Don't do this, don't be a fuck up" and you still do it... hahaha I don't understand.
Oh well still alive.
Thanks for sharing.

**edit** see I'm dumb IRA has nothing to do with investments, it's retirement.
I wasn't arguing anything, that was just rambling irrelevant on my part. After the first line(floating rate note) the rest was me spewing crap from my fingers/mind.
This company I will start working for soon(hopefully for a while), they offer some IRA matching and I wonder... everyone gets old. I'll get old(hopefully if not die) but I'm super f'd financially now and I'm inclined to just say I need that now versus set it aside. But I've seen/get the concept of compounding interest.
My idea of investments also is building products that make money on the side but if you don't know how to do that then others can do it for you eg. invest.

Good term, floating rate note hmm
Is the idea of "earned" a joke?
I don't know, like a poor person could rake leaves all day and "earn" 50 cents, like "wow I earned this money" but a person investing or someone who lives on royalties etc... almost seems like a lie to satisfy your mind. But different people different values... "materialism" I know I hate being poor/stressed out from debt so... I know which side I'd rather be on.
I don't know... what is value
Put in the effort and make it happen, I did that recently, it's great(got a job I wanted).

that's fine man, I mostly got out(most recently) in March granted I had like practically nothing. When I did my tax returns apparently I made some money but not much(under $100) but buying through Coinbase pretty sure I lost money haha. I'd buy $5 and the fee like base is usually always $0.99 so yeah... dumb
I had more fun writing my own little trader between block.io and shapeshift but I don't actually know how to trade/read charts so that didn't really go anywhere. Also lost 200 Reddcoin when I sent it to a litecoin address by mistake.
edit: I didn't get to the "back to USD" part through GDAX/possibly Coinbase's api. All I could do was "shift" between crypto currencies using block.io as the programmatic wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:15:10
Dude it's lucky I didn't make money, I'm so stupid.
I'm gonna buy $5 bitcoin today! (Coinbase - $0.99) haha
I did file though, and what sucked was tracing all my transactions on shapeshift across different devices, that was not great.

I guess faith in faith hahaha I know, it's the argument of gold, you can't eat it, but it's rare/could buy you a lot of food. I don't know I am ignorant in this subject for sure.
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:10:16
Conceptually I don't even understand this. Like I mean... your bank account is just digits. What is it tied to. Faith/responsibility that someone will honor their standing?
I guess the contract would "buy money" or someone has "real money" to begin with and then tie the money to a key but how are they actually linked together other than keeping a tab of "this contract has this much money"
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:43:24
Any big news right now? My low alerts are going off and I'm starting to buy into the dip but I'm like why does it keep dropping? haha

I'm doing programmatic trades. I did it already with block.io/shapeshift but I'm looking for a wallet that offers more options than btc/ltc/dogecoin.
Though I could just use those main coins and trade those. I have to actually work on the analytics part that makes the decision to trade. Don't worry I'm dealing with the tiny ones eg. Dogecoin. Hence why I was looking for a different wallet that provided other alts like Voxels, Reddcoin, Potcoin, etc... (currencies under $1 each preferably $0.001 or so)
It's dumb, distraction, I'm not a math/trade guy so... it will more than likely lead to loss. But I'll hook it up to Twillio (probably not use Slack it's free) and get the notifications like ```trading_bot_002 made a trade of 200 reddcoin```
Problem right now is sending into Coinomi addresses I can't get it back (with code). Coinomi has multiple wallets for at least 6+ of the &lt;$1 altcoins
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:33:02
I heard about this recently if his private key or something showed up in a transaction that's one way you could prove who satoshi is. Maybe not key signature or something. Was his the very first transaction ever with a bank or something man my memory is shot.
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:51:48
Interesting point. I assumed since I can't afford much I would stick to the cheaper ones, but the low volume makes sense.
Though what about the fees? It's not proportional eg. cheaper = less
Is there a reason that the major coins are few eg. Bitcoin being number one?
@_date: 2018-03-04 04:48:03
I sold almost 90% today, no particular reason, BTC is the only one I gained on. Hilarious how every sell on Coinbase costs you $3.00 I guess at least it's fixed? Buys cost $1-$2 Overall I still lost like $30.00 not to mention when I was messing around writing a trade function between Block.io and shapeshift I sent 200 redcoin into an LTC wallet address ahh... a beautiful mind moment
@_date: 2018-03-06 02:52:22
Wouldn't say I know 100%.
I was kind of shocked? By the $3 sell, $1-2 buy fee from Coinbase. With the trading the minerfee usually is like 0.01 which I'm not sure what unit that is (time to go read) anyway thanks for your time. I'll look into this more, I have currently cashed out majority of my "holdings". At a loss though like $30 sucks.
I did buy on that dip when BTC went back down to ~&lt;$6K but not that much
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:14:25
Yeah man, gotta write some dom traversing scripts to build an excel file/JSON output then hope you don't get banned/blocked.
I'm hoping it is not too expensive the API cost, probably coindesk I'm thinking. I want to get into programmatic exchanges through shapeshift/others but I wonder if the fees per exchange... still cool though.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:30:25
@_date: 2018-03-04 21:41:46
I'll have to look into that. You have to do the same stuff about validating your identity and what not? How about api not sure if you know anything about that.
Thanks for the tip.

I will have to read up on this if I deem it necessary to do so. 
My current experience with Tor is just running it as a browser, I don't know how I would bridge CURL with Tor unless you're saying that I have a VPS through Tor with an onion url or something? I don't know. I would use CURL with PHP that's what I do at this time.

Oh I thought like you know planets spin haha, that could make sense I guess? Would the spinning stop eventually because of the strong gravitational pull? I don't know. Since it's an oblong I could see the tangential force (moment arm) on the outer-most tip of the planet, then the rocking... I don't know sucks when you don't use physics/science you lose it.
I looked at some derivatives from a level 100 math class I took all the way up to calc iii and diff eq man... blank... haha
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:23:47
What does that mean? I have/use Tor, I use it for external ip source. How would you create proxy (numerous) just by saying Tor?
If you do know let me know that would be pretty interesting to programmatically interact with Tor as a thing you can change the ip eg. refresh the page and get a new endpoint.
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:22:38
I'm even right now (bought again at the recent dip) a couple of them are above though like 10% gains, I'm just wondering, how do you make money if when you sell you lose it (as you said).
Sell when it's made 50%? Also can continue buying... I don't know. I'm definitely trying to have it to "diversify" my financial interests.
@_date: 2018-02-17 03:33:52
Will put in my 2 cents, it was my own mistake. I traded into ETH and I thought I selected ETH but selected another version of ETH (or is it fork/type?) so I thought my money disappeared but it was in another coin.

Yeah that was a pain in the ass to do. Ended up forking over the $30 to import the transactions into a tracker. What was the worst was tracking shapeshift especially going to different devices.
At least with Coinbase I can buy knowing I'll have that CSV. But damn I'm so stupid every buy has a fee between $0.99 to $1.49 if not higher and selling it's $2.99 or something.... So yeah in the quantities I buy eg. $10 here $15 there it's stupid. Gotta look into gdax

I saw CoinBase has their own gains calculator in beta, not all of my stuff is in there but when I ran it, there was 0 gain output... 
I get it costs time to develop software, but the whole login thing... sure couple of clicks. Maybe I'll still do it though, my taxes were almost done I just  got hung up on this crypto thing though I'm quite sure I have only lost money.
edit: I'll give cointracking a shot, at least I'll do the first two lines above and a withdraw to see how they calculate the numbers.
edit: this is actually not that helpful, I'll try to just import something and see but when I try to add a transaction it is based on selling so I can't just add buys and then add a sell later on to see how the total buys are averaged/accumulated/treated as when you decided to sell some BTC that is less than the total of what you own, that you bought at varying prices.
edit: I'm probably not understanding what a trade is I guess. Though in my coinbase csv example, I sold three times and when imported, cointracking did not pick them up as trades. That could be on me for misunderstanding not sure.
edit: so I just decided to go with bitcoin.tax
Important to note, make sure to check the spending tab, when importing from Coinbase for example, the coin balance leaving your coinbase wallet doesn't mean that you sold it/spent it. In many cases for me I was just transferring it to another wallet outside of CB so you have to find those transactions and mark them as transfer instead of spent.
You'll probably get a mismatch error saying you spent more than you earned of a particular coin.
edit: son of a bitch... can't import the report to Turbo Tax, have to get their desktop software or mail it in... god...
