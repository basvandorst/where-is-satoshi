True, good tip for coinbase users. In general though, there is always a fee to move your coins. GDax covers the fee for that initial transfer into your personal wallet, but after that, you've gotta pay the piper. Of course you could choose to set a 0 fee (if that option is available in your wallet) but that also doesn't guarantee that your transaction will be moved in a reasonable amount of time, or ever (though that is unlikely).

I would probably hate it having to live through a mess like that. However, I love dystopian fiction and it made me a little excited as I fantasized about living in that bleak future. Someone could write a pretty cool novel based on the concept. Could probably have a decent niche market in the crypto world, too.

Yes. It always costs a fee to move the coins.

I made this post Sunday but it got auto modded and was later manually approved, gained no traction. Maybe it will help you.

Don't hold on an exchange unless you want to risk losing your coins. Hardware wallet should be fine but no one knows for sure how the fork may play out, information will likely come available as time draws nearer.

!!!! Bitcoin is meant to be used as well as stored. Without him and others using the currency as he did, its value would not be where it is today. And you're being annoying that's why.

Look at my post history you will find an idiot guide I made. Mine were trapped on Blockchain.info wallet as well. Ask if u have any questions.

Haha same I have to wait I can only buy in small increments!

Great point. It's fun to join the ride but unless you are betting on long term here, it's not safe to get your hopes too high. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:40:35
Good opportunity if true. Hopefully everyone saved a bit for that chance.

Read the sticky thread at the top of this sub. Great place to start, and a good time to start as well. 
Short answer though, start with Coinbase or Gemini, make an account and go through the hoops to get your checking account linked. Buy small amount of bitcoin, and while you wait for it to arrive, learn about and choose the wallet you want to store your coins in.  Have fun!

Killer. I'm in for the long haul and have largely been ignoring the recent downward volatility. This is an important message for those of us who truly do, or wish to believe in the ideals of this "revolution." 
For those looking to make fast gains: have fun but keep a level head about the fact that you are playing with an untested (in the long term) technology, and nothing is guaranteed. But while you invest and gain (or lose), look into the technology and try to understand it. It's not just another investment tool, even though right now, it is also that. 
I hope one day videos such as this will be in history e-books, looking back at where the technology humbly began. Be excited about that possibility, and don't bet your god damned house for the chance to be a millionaire! (Or do, it's your business). 
Start an online business, sell services for bitcoin. Become part of this history as a participant, it is a great feeling. Thanks for sharing.

It means you need 20k to really be able to throw around money and be able to make significant money while day trading. Sure you could day trade with less, but you won't have enough to make important money-making deals go through.

For me it happened almost immediately. Maybe try again and retype the pass phrase. Make sure you have a space between each word.

Still would be free money, and worth releasing the anxiety for some of us. I think that's the sentiment.

How can someone so closely tied to cryptocurrency be so dumb as to store keys on their computer? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:23:26
Seems pretty obvious to me yes...maybe I'm missing something? I can tell you are very very smart, but the vagueness of that response hasn't helped clear anything up. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:30:02
Thanks. That was kinda the whole intent of my original comment: 'how could he be so ignorant about something he relies on?' 
I understand, people be dumb, but it just shocks me still.
