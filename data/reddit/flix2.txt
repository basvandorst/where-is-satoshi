bitsquare is still in the very early days. Liquidity, volume, depth... they are not there yet. It looks promising for the future, but it does not solve our problems yet.
Ther are also remaining doubts over how useful p2p exchanges will be for some types of trading where instant settlement is important.
I think that these issues can be overcome... but nobody knows for sure.

If you can connect those 3 apps to Bitcoin, you have onboarded half the world.

Right now  claims that the median tx (250 bytes) requires $0.02 to be included in the next block (but it's a Sunday, on weekdays it's closer to $0.04).
If demand doubles by 2017 and SegWit provides 2MB equivalent blocks (NOT max_block_size)... and wallets get smart enough to help create a more efficient fee market... we could see fees in the $0.04-0.10 range. If the price of Bitcoin also doubles that would put us in the $0.10-$0.20 range (for a 250 byte tx) which is $1 per kB.
I can imagine people paying that, especially for international payments... but it would push a LOT of use cases to look for alternatives. Definitely no coffee on-chain.
It would be interesting to study how much additional safety or decentralisation is provided by staying at 1MB or 2MB... it would make the supposed trade-off more explicit.
How unsafe would it really be to be at 4MB equivalent (2MB + SegWit) in 2017? Or is it more a worry about slippery slopes and HFs?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but even if Segwit gives us 2MB *equivalent* blocks... actual max block size (in your scenario) will still be 1MB so the numbers for $1 per kB should be:
$1 * 1000 = $1000 per block = $144,000 per day
If Segwit allows twice as many txs per block that will be fewer $$$ per tx, but not fewer $$$ per Kb.

**Closing the loop** is a beautiful dream... but in the real world the only way it happens is that it becomes so easy to exchange btc for other currencies that people are already familiar with... that users start to become more confident in accepting btc directly, holding btc balances, etc...
So actually what Chip-chap is doing is helping enormously to get to where you want. Very few Greeks are going to set up OpenBazaar bitcoin-only shops to sell their goods/services unless they know that it will be easy to spend those bitcoins on their daily needs... or easily convert them to local currency.

Even beyond the risk of centralized exchanges going bust due to business incompetence or hacks, there are many other reasons why P2P exchanges make a lot of sense:
* Regulation (Exchanges being banned in many countries)
* Privacy (KYC requirements on exchanges)
* Banks (blocking exchanges)
* Security (central exchanges are huge honeypots)
* Market manipulation
* Fraud (exit scams are frequent)
* Speed of adoption (it takes a long time to set up exchanges in many countries)
* Fees 
@_date: 2018-09-18 08:41:09
It is very hard. But not impossible. There are several approaches that can work. One is Bisq's double-security deposit system. Another one is fractioning trades into increments (Coinffeine had a system like that).   Eventually atomic swaps should be an option...
@_date: 2018-09-18 08:45:33
The impact on privacy of asking for ID for all users vs only for arbitration (0.01% of cases) is simply not comparable.
Eventually there will be proof-of-payment tools that allow even arbitration to happen without ID. But for now this system is orders of magnitude better than centralized exchanges doing KYC on all.

Coordination is a big problem for markets. It's hard to get buyers and sellers to be in the same place at the same time.  Market-makers can bridge the gap... but they will not be attracted to a shallow market.

Miners are not subsidizing user transactions. Investors (hodlers) are subsidizing miners and users.

The IRS has two basic ways of knowing your income:
1.  You tell them.
2.  Your bank tells them.
That covers 99% of the info they receive.
The other 1% is people reporting you for revenge. (ex-wives, inheritance disputes, labor disputes, lawsuits...).
So if you don't tell them and the funds don't go through a bank (an incoming wire from a bitcoin exchange will probably trigger an SAR) you are probably safe.
On the other hand none of this is specific to Bitcoin. Cash income is exactly the same.

This could be used as evidence that it is a hoax... or that a disgruntled employee with inside info wanted to out him.
Somebody with access to that type of info (internal company documents, confidential e-mails) would have had access to stronger evidence. For example Satoshi's e-mails to other devs. His code. His early work. His recent work. 
However IF Wright is not Satoshi himself, he could very easily fabricate all of the "evidence" and leak it selectively.
I have to go with Ockham's Razor here: Wright has been hinting that he is Satoshi for a while... for bragging rights... and either was becoming impatient with nobody catching on (hence his attacks on Szabo) and decided to out himself... or an annoyed employee who believed the story decided to blackmail him.

My suggestion is that if I was a bank shareholder or executive I would be very seriously considering the impact that this will have on profits over the next 5 years. They are going to face global competition in what was once a very protected and stable local market.

Someone able to keep a big secret from everyone for 7 years has to be extremely in control and also not very outspoken to begin with.

When even Shapeshift is giving in to KYC, we really need to start thinking about  decentralized exchanges. The biggest problem with existing  is lack of liquidity. This could be solved if a sufficient number of people agree to try it at the same time.

Loans and credit are still possible with full reserve. Capital is still deployed and invested. There are a million words written debating this topic by some of the top minds in economics.
You are quick to dismiss it. 
I would venture that most people don't know much about how fractional reserve works. If they knew that "their" money in the bank is just a bank liability and that they are unsecured creditors... they would never lend it to the bank at near-to-zero (or even negative!) interest.
Most people surveyed think that a current account balance (demand deposit) is a custodial contract (like a car park). It isn't. It's a loan contract. Depositors are unsecured creditors. Unfortunately they will only find out when the bank goes under and they are bailed-in (see Cyprus).
@_date: 2018-09-17 17:05:12
Volume is very low. I would really like to know why: is it because people don't care about privacy, etc? Or is it something wrong with Bisq UX which should be fixed?
I suspect it's the former... but I really hope it's the latter because that can be fixed.
Or maybe it's just a chicken-and-egg problem of low liquidity. If that is so getting many people to try it on the same day might work in bootstrapping it.
I remember back in the day when Localbitcoins had only a handful of ads... maybe it just takes time.

@_date: 2018-09-17 18:36:01
Unfortunately that cannot easily be done as Bisq does not require identity. 
Your Bisq client *does* record (locally) data on your counterparts and identifies (by their onion address) traders you've done business with in the past. So you can build a reputation of sorts...
...but the whole idea of Bisq is that fraud-prevention is done via smart contract and not via reputation score, so that even anonymous people can interact with little trust needed.
Having tried both systems... so far I have seen less fraud on Bisq than on Localbitcoins. I suspect that scammers are really not happy to lock up funds in a public multisig transaction.

If you know of any non-working ATM there is a button you can click in coinatmradar. They do their best to keep the list updated, but help from users is also very necessary.
As for "get used once a month" it is certainly not true. I've seen the numbers from several ATMs and most are profitable for the operators. Those that aren't don't last long.
Of course the more complicated to use ones with lots of KYC (like Robocoin) are losing out against the simpler interfaces. No surprises there.

Sure the confusion and mess in the short term is a given. I mean long-term consequences... like when the forks are sufficiently different that they trade separately like altcoins...
Imagine for example that:
-50% of miners, 80% of devs, 20% of wallets, 20% of holders initially support Bitcoin X....
-50% of miners, 20% of devs, 80% of wallets, 80% of holders initially support Bitcoin Y...
-100% of Exchanges support both.
What would be the consequences 2 years after the fork? Would having 2 Bitcoins help or hurt adoption? Would miners switch to the more valuable coin or would holders migrate to the more secure coin? Would both coins co-exist or would there be a clear winner and loser? Would each coin find a niche (zeroconf &amp; cheap vs slow and secure? coffee vs settlement?)? Would overall adoption increase as both coins cater to a larger combined market? Would the sum of both coins be less or more than if Bitcoin stayed united because of network effects?
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:06:08
No. That is not how full-reserve banking works.
You can still make loans. You just have to get money from savers first and have these savers commit to a certain amount of time during which the money will not be available to them (term deposit).
What banks will not be able to do is long-term loans backed by short-term deposits. Or backed by money available in on-demand deposits. (ie: 20 yr mortgages financed by money in current accounts).
@_date: 2015-12-22 15:34:53
Decentralised consensus *online* would be more expensive than a newly designed centralised *online* consensus.... but that is not the case for banks, WU or even Paypal in many cases. Bitcoin is competing with huge bureaucracies burdened by very costly regulations and attempting to do a million different things.
Bitcoin does only one thing. By keeping it simple it will be able to compete on fees for the foreseeable future.
Also... Yes, licensed and regulated industries with massive barriers to entry tend to have higher-than-average profit margins... and inefficiencies. It comes with the territory when you use government licensing privileges to keep out the competition. The longer the privilege lasts, the more inefficiencies accumulate.

It is not the same making Bitcoin a settlement-not-coffee network now as when it reaches 100 million users.

I agree. That it is a voluntary system is for me the most important virtue of Bitcoin. 
Nevertheless miners vote and that vote has consequences. It is healthier for them to vote and show their preference than to be silent.
Why? 
First because it shows if consensus is possible (I still think it is -both camps still have the same long-term goals for bitcoin). Secondly it gives all of us a public signal and information which we can use to plan ahead.
Right now there is information asymmetry. A few people who have been to the right meetings know much more than the rest of us.

Originally it was... "one CPU one vote" from Satoshi's white paper, it isn't now.
In the short term it will have to do: miners vote with hashpower, hodlers vote with their money.
However the more explicit and granular people's reasons for voting can be made, the easier it is to see if there is room for compromise. A "red vs blue" election gives little info. A graduated scale with multiple proposals is better...

The only way to reach consensus is to see what users actually want. Only then a compromise that satisfies 90% can be reached.

Both Chinese miners and Core seemed happy with the Hong Kong agreement... 2MB HF + SegWit.

@_date: 2016-01-14 12:03:02
This is how I imagine it would work:
1. Oracle reports on price of asset (eg: S&amp;P500)
2. Issuer creates smart contract and locks 0.50 BTC
3. Buyer signs smart contract by sending/locking 0.50 BTC
4. On expiry contract asks Oracle if S&amp;P &lt; 1900 True/False
5. Contract pays 1 BTC to winner.
As long as the oracle is reliable and the contract is properly written the relationship between issuer and buyer is complete and finished the moment the contract is created.
Also there is no need for any data to be collected from investors. It basically eliminates/disintermediates brokerage.

Each node runs the software that they want to run. As long as it is compatible there is runtime consensus.
Any incompatible update should have a high activation threshold (75-90%?) before it provokes a fork.
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:41:29
Try a little empathy. Put yourself in their position. 
Do you think that they would be making this huge investment and effort and taking a huge risk if Bitcoin Core 0.14 included SegWit + a 2MB hard fork with a 90% activation threshold?
No... they would be putting all their efforts into trying to reach that 90% as soon as possible. We would probably have peace until 2018.
@_date: 2016-03-16 13:08:17
Agreed. If 90% of miners mine blocks with a version that is rejected by 90% of nodes (and exchanges, wallet providers, etc...) they will be mining worthless blocks.
But what happens if 90% of miners mine blocks with a version that 70% of nodes accept?
Then their vote *is* relevant.
In any case I see internal pool voting as a good thing. It will show how centralised hashpower really is.

People have a very mistaken idea about how safe haven assets behave in a liquidity crunch. 
Gold for example acted as a safe haven in the 2008 crash... but that doesn't mean that it's price did not fall. It fell as much as stocks, commodities and other financial assets. **When forced to panic sell, people sell everything!** However gold recovered and ended 2007  almost flat and only in 2008 went much higher. Proving to be the true safe haven asset.
It's not during the fall that an asset proves to be safe... it's in the aftermath when new money switches sectors. 
Because of this I think that in the next recession (2020?) Bitcoin will fall with the rest of financial markets in the panic, but then recover much faster thanks to its scarcity (and low % allocation from traditional investors)... and from there head into the next bubble.

Regulated companies are required to do KYC, AML. There is no avoiding it. I agree that it's bad ux, but blame the regulators.

@_date: 2018-10-15 14:48:56
One possible solution was implemented some years ago by **Coinffeine**. It didn't take off, but I think the idea has a lot of merit... 
It involved using an API-enabled payment processor combined with a smart contract. The payment would be broken up into micro-payments and until the API confirmed that each fragment was completed the next one would not be started. This allowed the re-use of a small security deposit many times to perform a larger trade without ever risking more funds than were covered by the security deposit.  That is, the security deposit was small, but it always covered 100% of funds being traded.
This was a very elegant solution, but it does require both parties to be on the same payment processor that allows instant, free, API-connected micro-payments.
I have yet to see something like this working beyond beta. But I'm hopeful.
@_date: 2017-01-26 10:18:12
Because there are limits. Only a small amount of KYC is needed for $10... but once you get to higher amounts more documents are required. 
Same thing happened to me with Revolut a few days ago... I reached the $300 tx limit and now I have to upload docs. It's a pain. But it's not a surprise.
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:37:14
That's a very good question. It is not a problem that has been properly solved yet and needs more work.
Some decentralized exchanges use a reputation system. Others use escrow or security deposits. Most avoid payment systems were chargebacks are easy.
\-**Reputation** normally means giving up on some privacy. 
\-**Security deposits** mean losing control of some funds for the duration of the trade.
\-**Escrow** can mean temporarily ceding control of all funds to a trusted third party.
No system is perfect. Until we can find some way of doing non-reversible atomic swaps between fiat and crypto, this problem will be  a big one and whoever can come up with the best solution stands to make a large and well-deserved profit.

The way things work in the real world:
First you achieve broad distribution and charge high margins to compensate risk of being first. Then.. after business model is proven and shown to be profitable, competition and efficiencies bring margins down.
If you believe that broad demand is already there.. then I suggest that you set up a competing network right across the street charging only 5%. 
If demand is not there... then high margins seem justified.

Bitsquare is amazing.
To all the naysayers complaining *(annoying voice) "but, but it's not very useful right now because of low volume"*
It seems to me that you are missing an amazing opportunity to be the first to create that volume. Just create a bunch of buy and sell orders at mkt price +/- 4%.

Just think about it! How much income do YOU personally generate for the bank in commissions, interest? 50? 100 bucks a year?
They would much rather lose you as a client than risk a problem with compliance that could cost them their jobs or a problem with regulators that could cost many 1000s in legal fees.
And no bank employee is going to risk 5 years in jail for giving you true advice on how to avoid a SAR. Even mentioning a SAR to a client can involve penalties for the bank employee from the bank's compliance department.

Please suggest what additional payment processors you would like them to add next. They want as much feedback as possible on that front!
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:51:21
Not having to trust an exchange with your bitcoins is at least 50% safer than centralised exhanges.
On the fiat side you still have to go through a payment processor... but eventually you will have many choices. Reducing risk substantially.
Also, any payment processor with millions of users is going to be safer and less prone to going bust than a 2 year old Bitcoin startup. Paypal has many flaws, but they are not going to disappear overnight.
Most importantly... the software is open source! It will eventually be able to connect to any processor with an API that does irreversible transactions. (As well as being useful for crypto-to-crypto markets).

Using a political analogy, in an anarchic Bitcoin Republic:
*  the Bitcoin protocol would be the Constitution. 
*  BIP would be constitutional amendments
*  A hard fork would be a referendum
*  Selling/buying Coin A/B would be migration or capital flight
The last two options are traumatic, divisive, volatile and harmful. However, as long as they exist they preserve freedom and the last resort of voting with your feet (and money). As long as there is little friction to exit and participation remains voluntary... there is liberty.

Your bank is not your friend. They don't work for you, they work for the Feds. 
Better to ask a friend, a lawyer or somebody who works at another bank where you do not currently hold an account.
The first thing your banker will do, must do if you ask them about this is to make a big note on your profile "50k in Bitcoin" and perhaps that by itself will be enough to ensure a SAR is filed. 
And by law they CANNOT warn you or tell you about it, else they risk running afoul of structuring regulations.
Bitcoin is a red flag. Gambling is a red flag. $50k is a red flag.
Better avoid banks. You are almost guaranteed a SAR.

There are many many changes on which there is unanimity. Most of the previous BIPs were implemented without objection.
Bitcoin core is very buggy and still needs a lot of work. It makes sense to focus on non-controversial fixes and upgrades first.
Also, the overwhelming consensus is only needed for changes which require a hard fork. (It is advisable anyway because a contested hard fork would cause huge uncertainty.)
There are a million changes, soft forks included, which can be done without consensus in different implementations, wallet software, other layers, sidechains, etc...
@_date: 2015-08-26 18:01:01
It is also worth mentioning that incentives are very different for these different groups... a **developer** holding little value in Bitcoin has little to lose by threatening the stability of the network, but a lot to gain by capturing the leadership of the project and becoming "benevolent dictator".
**Miners** with large amounts of capital invested in equipment, which they need to make a return on, are a force for stability. A 6 month contested hard fork with high price volatility could bankrupt them or at least reduce their profits while their rigs and asics become obsolete.
Merchant processors and **exchanges** would also be harmed. Incompatibility issues resulting from lack of consensus could also cause a lot of trouble to wallet providers and any other company providing software and infrastructure. Monitoring two blockchains would not be difficult, but would surely be troublesome and expose a lot of security issues (especially double spending risk).
In conclusion... it seems to be in the best interest of exchanges, miners, processors, etc.. to put as much pressure as possible on **developers** to come to their senses and reach a compromise. After all most developers will at some point probably expect to get a job, consulting fees or some kind of help from the well funded players in Bitcoin... and it is them that they are hurting the most by prolonging this indecision.
 
@_date: 2015-08-09 13:48:27
Check out  or  You will see several. Eg: BitUSD.
The HOW is extremely easy. As long as the issuer is ready to buy and sell to keep the price stable at the peg, it will work. (Within some tolerance limits).
In fact you could do it yourself with colored coins in about 5 minutes if you wanted to. Just issue 10 "dollarcoins" and promise to redeem each for $1 worth of Bitcoin. As long as you have $10 in reserve to keep your promise, it's simple.
A certain degree of trust is required that the issuer will maintain the peg, but it is less trust than what is needed if you hand over your money to a bank (or bitcoin equivalent).

Actually, I think that their system might actually work with Paypal where others have failed for 2 reasons:
-They want to use the micropayment feature in Paypal that allows for irreversible transfers
-Bitcoin or coinffeine will appear nowhere on the transaction. All that paypal will see is a bunch of p2p microtransactions (about $2 each) between two of its users. 
But we'll see I suppose...
@_date: 2015-08-09 20:31:50
As I said, it requires trust. But less than allowing them to hold your funds. Plus liquidity and the ability to sell your dollar- or eurocoins immediately is better.
Obviously I only recommend this as an alternative to using a third party value-lock system. It is not my preferred option at the moment.
Much better to hold bitcoins and cash directly. Avoid US banks except for small balances when possible.

I don't think you've understood how their escrow system works. 
From what I've read it seems a lot harder to hack (and with smaller rewards) than any of the other P2P exchanges.
Take a peek:
@_date: 2015-07-23 11:24:38
@_date: 2015-08-31 19:12:05
Should be possible... but they have not announced it for next releases. In theory their system is compatible with any payment processor or system that does non-reversible payments.
@_date: 2015-07-03 14:54:57
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:31:17
I am more optimistic. Each of these steps has added one more degree of decentralisation.
Coinffeine goes one step further... but it could still do more.
Obviously if you touch digital fiat you are going to have to go through a mainstream financial gatekeeper.
You could stick to physical cash &lt;--&gt; btc  
(either in person or via ATMs)... but this reduces reach and speed enormously.
@_date: 2015-07-23 11:25:11
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:35:59
When you say that they are not trustless... do you mean that Coinffeine can control your bitcoins? can they lose them or steal them?
Or are you talking about the fiat held at the payment processor?
Please elaborate.
@_date: 2015-07-21 09:06:16
You don't have to trust anyone with your bitcoins. You keep them in your own wallet.
There's no KYC/AML on Coinffeine's side, since they are just a software provider.
Payment processors do require verification.  (Although you can use an unverified OKPay account for small amounts).
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:58:05

BitUSD is not fiat. It does not provide an on/off ramp to crypto world.
Ripple is super centralised with gatekeepers and account blocking.
Only Locabitcoins.com allows you to exchange fiat &lt;-&gt; Bitcoin between peers. But it is very limited, is still somewhat centralised (because lbc keeps escrow funds) and is slow. Fraud is still a big issue.
Once Coinffeine reaches its full potential, with multiple payment processors connected, multiple currencies and enough liquidity... it will provide a much better market than anything we have right now. 
...and especially a much more resilient one, that cannot be taken down or regulated into irrelevance.
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:49:33
So the problem is with the payment processor, on the fiat side. That's why I asked before. You were unclear.
The thing about payment processors (like OKPay) is that some of them have APIs which allow programmed and automatic payments. I think Coinffeine is using this feature.
Of course they could shut down that feature... but as long as it works... as long as there is one payment processor available with this option....

-Limited to OKPay for now (It's a Beta!). Multiple payment processors can and will be added.
-Leverages Bitcoin payment channels to limit risk to a tiny fraction. First good use of this feature I've seen so far.
-Bank sponsored? It's a startup. They managed to get funding from a bank for a Bitcoin company? That is incredible.
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:17:03
If I understand Coinffeine correctly... there is no person behind the escrow. They use smart contracts and the properties of Bitcoin (esp. payment channels) to do the escrow automatically.
Because they can re-use the escrow amount multiple times.. it means that you never risk more than a tiny amount, even when doing large transactions.

SARs are unconstitutional. They directly violate the 4th and 5th ammendments. They belong in fascist police states.
On the other hand, as long as you keep your interaction with the bank to a minimum, it is very unlikely that you will be targeted. 
Enforcement is highly selective and motivated by asset forfeiture... If your balance is low, it is not worth it for them to go after you.
Just avoid banks as much as you can. The very fact that moving your own money as you like can result in doing something illegal, just because you made 5 wires instead of one... Shows you how arbitrary and dangerous banks have become.
Lock the value of your Bitcoins if you are worried about volatility. Better to avoid US banks altogether except for tiny balances (or loans).

There's different models... but they generally use some kind of multisig escrow or smart contract so that the exchange company does not need to ever control the funds. 
There are several projects: Coinffeine, Multisigna, OpenBazaar, BitSquare...
An intermediate model are P2P exchanges with centralised escrow, like Localbitcoins.... but these have a central point of failure and can be blocked by regulations... ie: Lbc is blocked in Germany.
I really liked the Coinffeine model... they actually had an open beta working at the end of last year. However it looks like the project has been discontinued. As far as I can tell it had nothing to do with their system, which worked really well, but more to do with their investors wanting to use the tech for other stuff. But is was open source... so maybe somebody will be able to pick it up and build on it.

Iza Kaminska:










As Tabb states:






Foreign exchange — time-zone differences which impede real-time settlement in general.
Allocations/confirmations/block process — you can’t easily fragment large purchases for liquidity reasons if your name is attached to every trade, opening the door to information leakage. Then there’s the issue of aggregating small trades into larger blocks, because an immutable, immediate ledger would prevent cost-averaging for group transactions.


Netting –moving to blockchain would prevent netting and thus require the processing of up to 2.9m more settlement records a day. Not efficient. Especially if you require consensus for everyone of those trades.
Technology infrastructure — record keeping isn’t everything and blockchain doesn’t solve or improve on the ability to manage accounts, drive P&amp;L, calculate risk etc.

First of all it would start gradually... no employee is going to want 100% of their salary in Bitcoin, but they might consider 10% and, if it works well, gradually increase.
Secondly 20k a day is pretty manageable for a Bitcoin ATM.
Thirdly.. any problems with cash management that the BTM operator might have are exactly the same as the dispensary currently has. Reducing the latter (or outsourcing it) is precisely the point. Obviously this won't be free... but if there is value added, finding the right fee to make it a win-win is just math.
Finally... no need for insults. As a former BTM operator I do actually know a bit about this...

The price and market cap is also a lot higher... so even if the market is more diversified and mature... is it 20x more mature?
Neither was 2013 the first bubble to follow this pattern... there were at least 4 previous ones and all looked very similar.
So when I say "2013-2015 is the base case scenario... but here is how I think it will be different this time" I am taking into account all the changes in the ecosystem *and* also the higher price and market cap.
But sure... use wishful thinking as a guide if you prefer it to scenario analysis ;-)

# Keep it simple!
If you don't initially expect more than 5-10 bitcoin payments a month, it's better to have a **paper wallet** (for in-person payments) or a simple bitcoin address than to go to all the trouble of setting up a payment processor.
You will receive a million overcomplicated tips here. Don't listen. Remember that simple works best and the more complicated the setup the more time and maintenance you will need... so if you end up not using it much you will give up. Whereas if it's simple, even if little used the mental cost is low.
I helped launch a Bitcoin Boulevard in 2013. 5 years later the only shops still accepting Bitcoin payments were the ones that used a **laminated paper with a QR code and Bitcoin address** stuck to the register (connected to a mobile wallet on the owner's phone).
Even with such a simple setup the owner lost his Bitcoin wallet several times, thankfully I had made sure that he had written a recovery seed on paper and put it away in a safe place in his house. He had to use it 3 times! (every time he changed phones he had to call me to help him do it again).

Anyone who thinks that we will have less than 6 months of consolidation and bottom-building after the correction from December 2017 bubble is ignoring history.
I do believe this time we will see new highs in less time than after 2013 bubble, where it took almost 2 years. But I'm thinking 6-12 months.
However the base case scenario is a repeat of 2013-2015: Bubble, correction, long consolidation until next run-up. So be prepared for a 2 year consolidation.

Yeah, you have not understood correctly. Bisq is 100% open source. You only need to change 1 line of code to remove that fee.

I think the idea is to just use it as a web GUI... for example you have your Bisq full client running on your desktop... but at the same time can manage your orders from your phone remotely. I might be wrong in my interpretation... but I don't see the downside of having this option as long as you are still connecting to your own Bisq node.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:46:24
The idea is to coordinate traders to place more offers on the order book for a week and then measure if that has an impact on volume traded.
The hypothesis is that a more populated order book attracts more activity from offer takers and first time users, hence more trading volume.
It is only a theory... but if it proves true then it could be used as a template to kickstart several p2p markets.

Actually this type of complex regression models are normally quite accurate... but they basically predict a repetition of previous cycles, so the value added is little.

Let's imagine that all the Bitcoin devs were arrested by a tyrannical government or bought by an evil mega-corp and forced to change a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin. Let us further imagine that this evil cabal managed to control 80% of mining power and used it to support the evil fork.
What aspect of Bitcoin, if it were changed, would make you reject such a fork and stay on the original chain against all odds? What change would you consider would destroy the fundamental virtues of Bitcoin?
Regular users, holders and nodes could block any fork by refusing to adopt, even against the devs and miners... but what is important enough that a significant majority would do so?

@_date: 2015-11-26 15:25:36
Exactly. The market is a price discovery mechanism. Participants have different subjective valuations. 
There are always attempts to "objectively" value assets based on different metrics (normally yield and risk related) and there are even such models for valuing commodities (based on structural supply-demand) and currencies (based on macro data like size of economy, growth, etc). 
However the value of these valuation models is eventually limited. Things change. The world changes. Industries disappear. Currencies die.
So yes a currency can be overvalued or undervalued just like a stock or anything else. The key question is which valuation model you are using.
IMHO any proper valuation model for Bitcoin would have "X = number of users" as the most significant variable.

Anything can be faked. But it is harder to fake market cap and volume in a highly decentralized system with diverse participants. 
You basically have to get a large percentage of volume to collude to maintain inflated prices... while at the same time preventing holders from unloading at those inflated prices. 
It's difficult. There's a real prisoner's dilemma there.
On the other hand.. in a centralized system like XRP where the volume and the holders are the same few people... it is very, very easy to pull off.

...but not much has been done in the past months and miners will soon have to choose between an existing, working implementation in BIP101 and doing nothing (or waiting indefinitely for consensus).

How NOT to reach consensus:
* Step 1: Backroom deal. 
* Step 2: Write ad-hoc code based on backroom deal.

This is how you do things in the old, corporate and political world. It does not work in a decentralized system where any backroom deal necessarily excludes a majority of users, devs, miners who should be participating in the decision.

A quick update to the crypto used should make Bitcoin quantum-proof. If we can get the devs to agree on which one that is....
But there are several crypto algorithms which have already been proposed and would make this a non-issue.
IIRC it is only ECDSA which is vulnerable to quantum and would have to be replaced. SHA256 would continue to be fine, at least for a while....

Auctions of forfeited goods remove the criminal "taint" and absolve the buyer of any liability related to previous ownership. Hence in all but the strictest most legalistic sense, the coins are laundered and re-enter circulation clean. 
You can nitpick definitions if you like, but the effect is the same. Vaultoro is correct.

Adoption comes in stages. Too few users to have network effect which would allow this direct p2p use on a large scale at the moment.  
However for Uber, Airbnb it would make a lot of sense as even if only 1% of their users take this option it would be worth it for them. Plus in many countries they have few payment options available. Sure this would mean 2 intermediaries: Uber + Bitpay.
But once you have millions of Bitcoin users paying via Uber... some drivers will catch on and eliminate the middleman. Others will become hodlers and eliminate both middlemen... or even replace Uber with an OpenBazaar-based decentralized app...

The current financial system is a centrally planned monopoly at the top with a banking cartel below and completely voiceless users at the bottom.
Bitcoin users have the final word on which currency to hold, which nodes to run. But miners are not voiceless either, the decide which chain to secure with their machines.
Will miners decide to mine the more valuable chain or will users move value to the more secure chain? 
I don't know which comes first, but I do know that both will have their own choice to make. No monopoly, no force.

Can't you piggyback the signal by embedding it into a GPS device? Hide a hashed tx inside the regular GPS positioning messages.... and then have another relay receive it as if it was doing triangulation.. but in fact be reading the Bitcoin tx hidden inside the positioning data.
In fact if you code a grid.. you can even send crypto messages by physically MOVING within that grid. The geo-location would translate to alphanumeric which could be decoded as a tx by a special node.

@_date: 2015-10-15 13:08:30
OK, let me give it a shot....
1. **Banks go the way of Newspapers.**
They won't disappear, but they change focus to value-added services like lending, intermediation and lose their current massive scale. Many disappear or break up, the most flexible go online for everything and start going after clients in a global way. In 2025 surviving banks are more like those newspapers that have survived the blogging revolution: different business model, focus on quality and brand-recognition and permanently aware that there are a million alternatives out there ready to eat their lunch if they don't treat clients well.
2. **Central banks go the way of the Postal Service.**
They will still exist, still think that they matter and still perform some functions... but their influence will be hugely reduced. They will be almost universally ignored... just the same way as central bank presidents in dollarised Latin American countries just focus on supervision and fraud prevention and have little to say on monetary policy. In 2025 they will still be able to move interest rates and do QE... but the ease of capital flight to quality and yield will mean that they cannot use these tools as freely as they do now for fear of seeing an immediate reaction in the FX/Crypto markets which negates their intended effects.
3. **Taxes will trend to fee-for-services and real estate.**
As capital becomes more mobile and it becomes ever easier to escape tax-heavy jurisdictions, governments will tend to tax more heavily assets that cannot be moved (real estate) and also services that they provide (toll-road model). Tax competition will increase... countries and cities will try to become attractive for investors and residents through lower taxes and more choice. The world will look a bit more like Swizerland where taxes are mostly collected and spent at the Canton (regional) level.
4.  **Africa will become much richer.**
As millions of people can suddenly interact directly and get paid by employers in the developed world or receive remittances from their families at zero cost and without their local governments easily confiscating them. Anyone with technical and language skills in Africa who can get online will suddenly be able to compete with US and European workers for jobs and wages. In 2025 people living in extreme poverty will be less than 5% of the world population.
5. **More Peace.**
The increased difficulty in collecting taxes or printing money for unpopular causes like war will mean that wars last less and are more limited in the harm that they do. We will see tax revolts as a form of anti-war protest, with millions of people refusing to pay VAT or income tax until the government listens to their cries for peace, and unable to do anything to persecute such a large passive, peaceful resistance movement.
6. **Technological Renaissance.**
As capital accumulation in the technology sector grows and is less stifled by taxes, regulations and monopolies... investment in R&amp;D grows and the rate of technological advance increases. Technological and economic growth see exponential rates last seen in the Industrial Revolution or the Renaissance. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 16:08:45

@_date: 2015-10-15 13:55:02
Important addition to point 1.
Banks will be forced by client demand to use multi-sig deposits, so that they no longer have the power to confiscate or block deposits in current accounts. People would once again be owners of the money that they have in their current account, instead of creditors of the bank.  (Term deposits would still be bank liabilities... but smart contracts would probably put limits on what banks can do with them).

How to become a market maker:
Choose a currency and payment method. Have some bitcoin reserves and balance ready in your currency wallet. For example buy/sell BTC for CNY with OKPay.
Create offers to BUY Bitcoin in CNY:
* offer to buy 0.25 BTC at market price - 1%
* offer to buy 0.50 BTC at market price - 2%
* offer to buy 1.00 BTC at market price - 5%
Create offers to SELL Bitcoin in CNY
* offer to sell 0.25 BTC at market price +1%
* offer to sell 0.50 BTC at market price + 2%
* offer to sell 1.00 BTC at market price + 5%
..and you have just made the BTC/CNY market much more liquid for everyone. Your reward? The 2-10% spread between your buying and selling price.
Step 2... if/when demand justifies it... increase the size of your offers x10.

A trend is defined (Dow Theory) as a succession of higher highs and higher lows (uptrend) or a succession of lower lows and lower highs (downtrend). 
Since the low at $150 on January 2015 you can clearly see that each low has been higher and there have been 2 attempts to break $300. Another higher high (say at $310) would confirm this. A drop below $150 would break the trend.
Markets never move in straight lines, they zig-zag. That is why trends are never defined by an individual price point.

...and still for over the past months every media feature of Bitcoin has always opened with "The price has crashed from $1000". Not once have I seen a talking head mention that a couple of years ago it was under $10, or even that it has been in an uptrend for 9 months now.

Well if 1 million people spend BTC each in payment to 5 different people it would look like this:
If each step takes 1 year it would take 10 years to get to 2 billion owning some bits. Although I suspect that once it catches on it will be much faster than that.

"Conflating central banks with central planning is spurious"
Exactly what Micklethwait would say. Next you'll tell me that financial market regulation and government intervention is not intervention or regulation.
But, bigger debates aside, I have read every single article that they have published on Bitcoin since 2010: they have always disparaged it. Even in this overall positive article, the opening shots are vicious:
"BITCOIN has a bad reputation. The decentralised digital cryptocurrency, powered by a vast computer network, is notorious for the wild fluctuations in its value, the zeal of its supporters and its degenerate uses, such as extortion, buying drugs and hiring hitmen in the online bazaars of the “dark net”."
...it is only partially rhetorical device...

The Bisq exchange, despite relatively low volumes, is a huge success in achieving truly decentralized bitcoin p2p exchange. An exchange that respects **privacy**, **user control of funds** and is **uncensorable** is still extremely necessary for Bitcoin to go global.
It will be very interesting to see if the Bisq DAO can prosper without the founder. Even if it doesn't... thanks to Bisq being open source, the code will be there when it is once again urgently needed.

Bitcoin trading volume was surging in Iran... so **LocalBitcoins** is being forced by regulations to block the country. This will happen again and again to other countries: first countries under sanctions, then OFAC list, then any country deemed "high risk" by banks...

1. Because XMR users care about privacy
2. Altcoin trading is faster and more secure than anything with fiat

In this case it should be:
To be **uncensorable** you need it to be decentralized. Any centralized exchange can be  banned... as we have see in China, India, etc, etc.
To be **private** you need it decentralized. Any centralized exchange can be forced to implement KYC.. as we have seen in US, EU...
To be **secure** you need it decentralized. Any centralized exchange can be hacked, exit scammed, go bankrupt or incompetently lose user funds... as we have seen with MtGox, Bitfinex, Binance, Coincheck, etc, etc, etc...
And in practice Bisq works. 25.000+ completed trades and only 3 cases of fraud. I see it as an amazing success story.
Can it scale to millions of users? I don't know. That is the next challenge for the DAO. (Or for whoever thinks they can do it better... it is open source after all).

It's a fact that people with large unrealized paper gains in their book are prone to panic sell, or at least to very rationally reduce exposure. So the fact that price is up 1500% in 2 years is a significant factor.
Of course markets are people... and an event trigger serves as emotional motivator. But it's wrong to conclude the trigger is the cause.
It's a property of emergent systems (like price discovery in markets) that determining cause and effect is very complicated.

It's a first step in the right direction. If it is successful, Uber will copy it in other countries. When the volume is large enough... they will integrate with Bitpay... eventually they will just accept Bitcoin directly.

By the time Satoshi liquidates his stash, if ever, confidential transactions and full Bitcoin fungibility will be standard. He will also choose a jurisdiction with no Bitcoin capital gains tax to do so.
With that kind of money you can even buy your own country.

Right now Bisq Network is the closest thing there is to a full DEX for BTC-fiat exchange.
