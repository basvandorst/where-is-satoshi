My guess is he meant innovative in the sense of an actual improvement for what they're trying to do. 
I'm not sure though, maybe it is at least innovative/improving in a way that it makes it harder for them to fuck each other over.

hehe, look at all these proofs he's giving. very convincing :-)

I wouldnt be surprised if BitcoinBelle is somehow related to the Cointelegraph/Bytecoin/Coinmarketcap Scam. Check how often she got featured and/or painted by one of their graphic design guys.

not sure where to start... but a good introductory read is 
the company/people behind cointelegraph are also operating coinmarketcap, that's why there are exclusive ads for cointelegraph all the time and bytecoin is listed as not being premined :D 
I hope it's fine if you go through the linked reddit thread first, but I'd be happy to try digging out some more what others have gathered so far, if there are still questions left.
edit: if you want you can also add the exchange hitbitc.com and thebinary trading site [btclevels.com!]( to their scammy network. follow the link for a laugh ;)

Bitsquare is an awesome piece of open-source software, I've already completed two trades in the last weeks without any bigger problems. Sure the liquidity might be low right now, but it is improving. I also like the arbitration system Manfred has come up with. 
Btw I've read somewhere that Manfred has paid the development completely out of his own pocket. If true, please show the bitsquare guys some extra love everybody :-) (

agree with the dude here, not showing any proof while showing a lot of butthurtness won't help you.

not sure who you refer to by "most people". but the most people I know are clicking on almost anything popping up in their browser.

hm, define legit... ;-) 
if you haven't tried already, it is possible to participate in the bankroll of some casinos/gambling sites. however be very careful which site you choose. generally the longer it has been running the better, but there is no guarantee of course. exit scams have happenend before and will happen again. a nice overview of the rather trusted sites can be found here (including lots of stats)

yip, on btct it says: "News: Due to DDoS attacks, there may be periodic downtime."

let's just say that I don't trust his moral compass:

yep, people shouldnt forget his massive bitcoinica/intersango fuckup. a lot of people lost a lot of bitcoin and amir simply disappeared, pretending nothing ever happened.
he is NOT one of the good guys.
edit: most of the time it appears that after he gets into something new, he is completely stoked about it/hyping it, but as soon as there appear bigger obstacles he just vanishs. how many of the projects he touched are still alive or have ever been finished?

I saw the steem pump the last days. isn't that essentially zapchain all over but with own tokens? not sure what happened to zapchain, but haven't seen anything from it in a while...

you can google that info really really easy. takes less than a few mins to get your answers.

There is also the possibility to participate/invest in the bankroll of some bitcoin casinos and gambling sites, getting you a percentual share of their profit (and in case of lucky players their losses too ofc ;-)). Not sure if you deem this legit though, but it is a clear +EV investment.
A few of those are running succesfully for years now being maintained by known bitcoin community members.
