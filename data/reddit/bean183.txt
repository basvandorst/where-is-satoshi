He said on the Joe Rogan experience specifically that he was not a bitcoin millionaire.

Not going to lie, I didn't watch the video, I was trying to respond to that troll spouting nonsense but his comments kept getting deleted

No. Its a stupid fantasy calculator. Don't invest anything you aren't ready to completely lose.

If the internet goes down the global economy goes with it. BTC will be a drop in the bucket in the amount of panic generated.

What is on the horizon to make bitcoin easier for the end user? The steps to move things in and out of cold storage are a little ridiculous sounding; it effectively locks non technologically minded people out of bitcoin completely.

I was just reading up on coinbase through old Reddit posts and thought i would recognize your great advice! 
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:31:54
This guy is awesome. I hope he is the real SN, but don't really care either way.

I would say this doesn't exactly contradict my response, it is supplemental information. The point I was trying to get across is that if its anything TOO simple and a common phrase it will be in a dictionary attack. So a three digit password of 'dog' is easily guessed in a dictionary attack, but  '₥⊢➷' is not. So 'bartsimpson' is not safe from a dictionary attack, but would be from a brute force attack on BIP38.

You are 100% correct in all of your points. Don't click links in bitcoin/new if you don't know what they are. If something has no comments and you don't know what it is, assume it's malware until proven otherwise.  
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:17:50
Yeah I guess I really wouldn't. It was the first thing that popped into my mind though. 
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:56:00
I don't care what it is, I WANT TO INVEST!!

Since his parent post got deleted Ill just post this to you since it supports you - 
Saying bitcoins can be mined at any value is like saying you can find a giant nugget of gold by luck. YOU COULD, but on average gold costs ~1000 oz to get out of the ground, and on average bitcoins have a price to be mined.

entropy is always important. Don't leave yourself open to dictionary attacks. bartsimpson3 isnt good enough either.
