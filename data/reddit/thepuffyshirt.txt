Everyone here is like a gold miner in the Wild West.  You guys stumbled upon something incredible, but best believe there is someone who is going to be trying to take it from you every which way possible until it's boiled down to a business.  The trust is not there.  That's what Bitcoin is to me, an incredible opportunity spoiled by the masses as well as corporate greed.  It's a shame.

Not comparing digital currency to Apple pay, just saying it will rip away momentum and growth. It's *apples* to oranges.

I don't at all, nor did I ever say that.  I just think it is vastly detrimental to the value of the original aka BC.  Couldn't care less though, promise you that.

There are a plethora of companies that are using digital currency that is NOT bit coin, and major companies are basically trying to phase it out to create market space for themselves or use their own brands version.  ApplePay is going to smash the idea of bit coin to pieces sadly just because of essential rebranding and foundation related success...

 " I rarely cite the WP but this should really help explain to you why your BC are only going to keep dropping in value.  At least in the next couple years.  Long term who knows... Too many variables though to work and too many middle miners devaluing.

Tell that to the millions of people who lost their lives to Madoff or any other Ponzi.  A true Ponzi scheme is only one if it is structured in a way where there is long term reappropriate ability.  It's so sad to watch you guys wishful thinking because you already invested rather than covering your asses and bailing while you can.  Bitcoin has already failed.  We are now in the stages of weeding and pulling out all the unnecessary factors which will render the currency meaningless.  TheGlobe.com. Look it up.  100 billion dollar company that never made a cent.  It is now trading at $0.000000000001 cent.  This is a massive bubble and officially the Worst performing currency in the entire world.  Worse than the Rubble or even Greece.

My sentiments exactly.
