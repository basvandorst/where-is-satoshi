I really don’t want this fucking idiot associated in any way w| crypto if I could be totally honest here....... ��
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:04:42
Lmao you know a bunch of 26+ that are desperately holding on to a dream that will never pay off but hey if ya love the sport that much who am I to argue I suppose ��‍♂️ Thank goodness for social safety nets am I right ��
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:26:55
Lmfao wow don’t go giving up your bitcoin anytime soon �� you seem like the type that’s gonna desperately need it in the future, if you think Trump has any level of respect as a “businessman”.

“Bad at assumptions” then goes on to name &amp; assume positions on a bunch of irrelevant stories that have nothing to do with anything �� as if anyone here cares about anything you listed, you’re in a crypto sub buddy put the kool aid down. I have no bags as heavy as NANO. Stop while you’re behind.

Lmao what. I’m years removed from that. I’m 25. Played football &amp; wrestled (4 year varsity) in high school, but I took 10 APs so went to University of Miami on a bit of an academic scholarship. Wasn’t willing to cut weight at the college level for wrestling, &amp; wasn’t probably getting more than D3 for football. You fresh out of high school? I’ll tell you right now, as a D2 athlete just enjoy it while you can, there is over a 99.9% chance there is no next level. It happens that I develop software for a gym I have a heavy interest in, I’m in crazy good shape �� 5’10 ~190 strongest I’ve ever been but still relatively lean ~11/12%. I sincerely hope you’ve got something outside of athletics going for you. &amp; if not that bring us around to my first point, don’t go gambling away your crypto. By the way I’m also nice af at basketball ��

I came to explain reasons you’re wrong &amp; why you’ve been bamboozled into this way of thinking, but I see you own NANO. 
There’s no helping you.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:28:18
The people behind it &amp; the short sighted nature of it’s “solution.” 
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:12:19
Yea imagine playing games &amp; trading crypto �� I just peeped yours tho it’s kinda rough. Lotta dank_memes, the_Donald, I mean dude literally has a post in lol. Are you finding fulfillment in your life? Seems like something’s missing. Find a gym bro get on a a consistent fitness regime get in shape &amp; shit. Take that .0061BTC &amp; head down to Fort Lauderdale or Miami treat yo self to a nice dinner or some drinks. Meet a nice liberal college girl tell her you own bitcoin &amp; make memes it’ll be amazing. I’m telling you man you’ve got this whole life thing completely wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:29:44
Step on up where lmao
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:31:55
That last scenario seems most likely to me, or a bit of a lull period then YoY explodes for a little then settles back down 
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:30:32
I was pretty sure none of this was really worth the time but “I drink seltzer because I’m a D2 athlete bro” just made it worth it ��

@_date: 2017-11-21 20:16:34
Wow the comments here are so disheartening I thought we were supposed to be smarter than your average over here...

Remember? If you’re not using it every day (losing your wallet every day) you won’t be doing much remembering. Write it down keep it somewhere safe.
