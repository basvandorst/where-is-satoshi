That's what I'm trying to do but I'm sitting here with 0 confirmations on my transfer after 24 hours as we get closer to the 9th
Edit: grammar

I hope you didn't use Coinbase or GDAX because they just lost a suit and are now reporting all transactions of $20,000 or more. It's only a matter of time before they release all transactions.
The IRS doesn't come at you with guns, they freeze your assets and take everything you're worth.
Pay your taxes dude.

When you moved from Mycelium, what mining fee did you choose? I went economic and waited about 48 hours, but at priority it took 20 minutes
Take a look at this for some perspective. There are almost 100k unconfirmed transactions and without a good mining fee it is less likely for your transaction to be confirmed quickly

Just know if you do this to keep record because it's a taxable event

HODL most of your investment? Sure, but there is nothing wrong with selling off a percent or two at milestones to recoup some of your initial investment and really feel the benefits of Bitcoin

That's funny, it's actually the opposite. The IRS targets every day Joe's who can't afford attorneys to fight back. They have a much better prosecution rate that way. They don't go for he rich because they know they'll run into off shore accounts

Don't forget to set some aside for your upcoming tax return

Agreed, and when I made my first purchase my credit card company checked with me. I just think it's BS that they cancelled his transaction anyway

I really wish it would drop to 14k levels

Funds received as income must be declared as such on your 1040 as miscellaneous income. So that $60 of capital gains will likely just decrease your tax return by a small margin

Interesting, and how are you going to turn your bitcoin into cash without an intermediary bank account in your name with unexplained funds?

If you were lent $3000 to invest for a year, you would have to pay long-term capital gains taxes. 
For an example lets say $3000 = 1BTC
You take the loan, and the value of BTC triples over the year you hold it. it's important to know that until you sell, you do not owe taxes. Keeping the money on an exchange does not protect you from owing taxes though. The act of selling is a taxable event. 
Since you held for 1 year, your gains are subject to long-term capital gains taxes (depends on your bracket, but unless you're very wealthy its 15%). So your 9000 profit is subject to 15% capital gains taxes ($1350). You then need to repay your loan. If he isn't charging you interest, that leaves you with $4350 of profit in your pocket.
