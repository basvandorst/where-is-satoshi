From what i know as soon as you give the money to the bank, its not your money anymore, its bank's money, you exchanged your money for a contract between you and the bank, on the bank's terms, the bank gave you no option to negociate it. If you can't get your money, by traditional means, the last option is always to take them to court the bank or the state whoever has the money, the trick is both bank and state can change laws and rules about what happens to the money without asking or informing you, because its a centralized system.

I am not sure how reliable is cointelligence website, but here what their review says about estonian B2BX:
"***After studying the exchange’s volume and trading patterns, we came to the sad conclusion that most of the volume B2BX displays is faked and does not represent an accurate picture of what’s going on at the exchange at all. This only raises our suspicions that the exchange is involved in other shady business, although we currently do not have another thing to point to as suspicious behavior.***
***To conclude, while we do not believe B2BX to be knowingly operating an illegitimate operation, they do apparently fake their volume numbers – a very concerning fact – and there are several key metrics which prevent us from recommending the exchange."***
