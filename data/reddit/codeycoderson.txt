I'm super new to this so sorry if a dumb question. I have my wallet in Coinbase, correct? Is there a way to transfer my bitcoin to a wallet on Gemini? Is the wallet independent? Can I have a wallet on Gemini and transfer contents to Coinbase? Vice versa?
Thanks for any help.

Right now, because I just bought a large amount :(. It's current on the most drastic dip in a past few days.

Can someone answer this? I'm really new to bitcoin and bought $300 worth a day ago. It was through coinbase. What's another reputable exchange that I can use a debit card to purchase? Gemini like OP said?

I bought bitcoin through coinbase less than 24 hours ago. First dip into the crytpocurrency world. 
Did I make a mistake using coinbase? :(

Same bull.

It's gone up ~$400 in 24 hours...?

Please, bitcoin gods, just tell me if I should buy more right now.

Looks like it just might. Bought at the top of the bubble...

I've been waiting for almost 2 weeks to get my bitcoin from Coinbase. It says they should arrive today. I downloaded breadwallet yesterday, created the wallet.
My question is, am I going to have to pay these high fees everyone is discussing in order to send the bitcoins from my Coinbase account to my breadwallet?
thanks for any help or explanation.

Why not sign up with Coinbase or breadwallet and buy right away?
Assuming coinbase is working atm.

Doesn't this answer your initial question? If you think 8 bucks will be 300 (i'm aware you're just throwing numbers out), why wouldn't you buy more?

OP posted a link that has people talking about a 1.3 dollar drop back in ~~2008~~ 2011. You guys don't even look at the fucking post?
