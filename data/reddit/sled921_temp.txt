Thanks for explaining all that. I appreciate it, and I'm impressed by the detail.
Seems it was quite the comedy of errors. Or perfect storm. Or something.


Speaking of your hours of operation, please consider also posting them on your website. (That might have done the trick for me, too.)


Same here. Thanks Cade.
EDIT: See "EDIT2" in the OP.

Thanks for sending the login info. I did receive it, and was able to take over the account. Mission accomplished, finally.
Can we talk a little about all these miscommunications?


The very first email I received from you guys (automated response to my order submission) included the following info:








Between that, and the fact that you were posting replies in on Sunday, I thought it seemed reasonable to expect a response over the weekend. (Even so, I did figure I might not receive a response until today, so I was kind of waiting.)
Can you elaborate on your hours, etc.? Is the email wrong?


This is...mysterious, because I sent some via your website, and some via email to you and others, and PMs to you and others from this account. But, I am not going to go back and count all the messages I sent. If you can shed any light, please do.


Yeah, that really made a bad situation worse. Do you know anything about how, why, or when it happened, or who did it?
And lastly: I plan to choose a different (more reliable) email provider soon. Would you be willing to provide this service for me again sometime, via email (without phone)?
