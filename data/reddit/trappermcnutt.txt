could you expand on this? i see nowhere to change the password in account settings.  i reached a 're-set' password link by doing a search, which they sent me, but i still can't change it to my own password?
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:21:19
that'd be lame
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:18:00
yeah it's been like this for a few days since i first tried. might they deactivate inactive accounts or something?
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:45:22
thanks that kind of worked - but now it's saying invalid username/password.
eh - who knows.  guess i dont' really need to get on there.
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:34:14
ok thanks i will try that.  how do i find the txid on block explorer? 
edit: i mean I've got the transaction open in block explorer - is it the value on the first line?
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:46:30
that totally worked - 3 confirmations now
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:09:28
I won't fucking talk to people about bitcoin any more its exhausting.  everyone wants to talk when it's 20k: "should i buy? how do i buy? how many do you have?"
my answer everytime: "get your money to a point where you "CAN" buy (on an exchange).  start considering your options when you have the ability to act.  secondly: no don't buy now - wait until the price halves.
now that the price has halved: "nah nm i'm not that into it anymore"
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:57:51
yeah they eventually will. i had another handfull of friends this last news cycle ask about how to buy crypto.  people who have heard of it for years now are starting to realize that it's not going anywhere and the tech is still rapidly evolving and they want to get in.  we were all someone at some point who had never bought bitcoin, and then did. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:42:18
well fuck that's discouraging
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:15:24
rolling stone (or maybe it was forbes) article about silk road
@_date: 2013-05-29 14:49:18
no i guess not. but they would have needed to have access to her email and know exactly where she was traveling. and they only asked for a few hundred dollars. if i was scamming i'd at least ask for $500. sounds legit
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:43:03
first of all it can't at this point. not gonna get into the technicals b/c you can research that on your won. but it's the same way you can 'magically produce' money by digging up diamonds or gold.  it's not magic, it takes work, there's a lot of competition, but in the end yes a powerful computer consuming electricity can find these things that are rare and others consider valuable.

I see product worth $100USD going for &lt;.5btc
will the hedge negate that or should we be BUYING DRUGS!!
@_date: 2013-08-12 20:27:50
yeah i checked them out.  i like the idea but i can probably do better than %2.  
funny because i bought a similar domain name earlier this spring but couldn't quite figure out the business model and forgot about it until now. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:13:22
perfect. i love larry david i forgot all about that show i'm gonna get back into
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:19:13
get a bunch of awesome drugs. if you want to cash out to dollars - just sell the drugs (for more).
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:52:51
ok that clears some things up. but then why are people often suggesting that one needs another offline computer.  couldn't i just take my computer offline, generate the wallet, and then export it to said devices above? 
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:14:41
i did not know css had an 'animation' property
@_date: 2013-05-14 21:05:56
yeah ok. after a brief initial panic that my usd would be frozen i read some more and realized that DHS has just inconvenienced me in moving money in and out of Gox.  I'm sure there are and will be other ways.  In the past two years i've never actually sent USD out of gox anyway - just spent btc.

@_date: 2013-04-12 22:41:17
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:38:08
yeah I guess. just seems so dumb.  especially if you're working with serious money - I'd rather be on an exchange that was built for bitcoin from the ground up.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:33:24
that's strange but true. maybe not the same - but i've heard very similar things from drug dealers and other criminals who report immense relief when they finally get caught.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:00:58
these were the hardest i laughed all day
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:32:30
interested in what people think of the "scaling" portion of that article
@_date: 2013-09-03 00:55:21
not sure what you mean by 'not bitcoin' - this would be all bitcoin. but yes i agree the potential for fraud here is high - i just thought maybe someone could think of a secure way to make the deal.
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:41:44
does that only apply if your placing market orders? do people actually do that?
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:20:56
dammit shupack - that's not the advice i was looking for. and yes i AM going to do that now. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:23:53
how do you know these things?
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:41:11
don't sweat. as long as you don't sell for a loss you can't lose. it'll be back there eventually patience is key
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:56:33
wow this game kinda sucks... i mean 0 entertainment value
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:13:22
jesus that sucks
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:13:54
oh yeah i've noticed that. how do you do that? just make it up?
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:16:57
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:01:16
well by fiatless i meant fiatless on the exchange. i've still got plenty of money for milk.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:36:15
yeah being only responsible for yourself is fucking awesome
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:43:47
ok nm i think i got it. apparently i had pinned the wrong armory client to my desktop and had opened the offline version?
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:16:49
gotta love the enthusiasm kid keep it up - it's refreshing. sounds like you're in it for the long haul. nice name by the way
@_date: 2013-05-25 12:40:53

the only way to beat the house is to drink the rake. a shot and a beer every hour...
otherwise - yes level headed and consistent poker players can definitely beat out bad one's. 
@_date: 2013-03-18 23:35:21
how do you know these things - where can i see?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:57:08
i believe it opens this hour. am i wrong?
@_date: 2013-08-12 20:41:23
lotta hate on their facebook page
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:56:57
bitcoin you cock-tease
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:06:24
Don't hold. BUY!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:09:51
so people are just placing market orders with a 1h lag?
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:15:20
Yeah i just ordered a lot of "fixes" considering the coin value on the road is still double that of the exchanges.  that' some arbitrage
@_date: 2013-03-28 18:10:07
okay so no one really holds any bitcoins but we hold keys that give access to the network agreed upon location of a bitcoin?
and so there is no bitcoin anywhere - just the agreement that they were created and exist and have been passed around? not quite there yet but starting. to. grasp....
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:05:40
just STAHP
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:21:22
I agree we need a /r/ for speculators and technical analysis and gambling advice. i would love it
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:37:03
hmm. i'm thinking about 20 coin orders at 100 and 80. that would leave me fiatless
edit: not fiatless in life - fiatless on the exchange with what i'm put aside for bitcoin speculating
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:21:06
Bitcoin is just like these coins that you can use to spend stuff.  Some people have lots of them cause they mined them out of the internet with computers and we know how much they cost because if you count all of the bitcoins you can tell. google doesn't tell you much about it youre better offs just buy some bitcoin on the street or just look for some on google until you can find some to download and invest in it and then print them out. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:32:06
very currency, wow!
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:55:21
gawd bless em
@_date: 2013-05-07 23:05:47
I think he already made them rich
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:00:41
where can you view these individual orders?
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:33:03
Old wise bull and young bull hanging out in the pasture. Adjacent to them and separated by a fence is the cow pasture. One night a storm blows through and breaks the fence.  In the morning young bull sees this and exclaims:
"holy shit - old wise bull look! there's a hole in the fence. let's run over there and fuck one of those cows!"
old wise bull shakes his head slowly:
"young bull... so much to learn. no we're not going to run over there and fuck one of those cows. we're going to *walk* over there, and fuck *all* of those cows."
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:45:13
who is they? how are they coordinated?
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:55:56
so that article says i did not need to download qt and the blockhain first? everything i've read on the armory site seemed to say it needed to sync with bitcoin-qt.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:59:41
that's fucking huge as far as i'm concerned -bitcoin buying FOOD (that stuff is important). I know people who use foodler alot.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:27:22
yes. on the dashboard it says Bitcoin-QT is not running but it is.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:46:56
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:27:08
that was awesome. i wonder what the rest of the scene looked like? nobody dancing?
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:04:58
well shit i don't know. we'll see i already western unioned. the scammer would need her id and be in the specified country to receive it right? that's what they said at the shop.
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:52:44
"cashing out just as bitcoin peaks" is impossible. nobody knows when it's going to peak.  as CafeClope said who's to say they didn't cash out when it 'peaked' at $10 to realize their %10,000 profits.
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:13:45
dammit i know. but they'd need her ID to pick it up so they said at the western union office. so how would scammer do it?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:13:45
which is?
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:38:05
wasn't really scared of it going down per say - just a bitcoinaholic here....mmmm love that coinahol
@_date: 2013-05-02 00:49:42
well yes, we all know bitcoin could utterly fail, but the chances the price never touches 140 again before failure is pretty small imo.  i'm just saying be patient, price goes up and down.  make your decisions and stick with them rather than chasing woulda, coulda, shouldas. patient traders win b/c they wait for the market to turn in their favor instead of panic selling and buying and LOCKING in losses.  
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:56:23
Have they released any statements as to what's going on?
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:34:46
what exactly is lagging?
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:34:03
so what if i've got an ask in for $1000 and they make the typo?
@_date: 2013-04-27 00:40:46
Yeah not saying I played it perfectly. I'm new to markets. But in the end I still cashed out a few hundred percent profits and am now re-invested with house money.
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:23:45
Is there a chance they can seize and/or freeze the mt. gox accounts? I've got a bunch of USD sitting on gox. It sounds like as of now they've frozen Mt. Gox's american processing arm, but can they touch Gox itself?
Might it be a good time to convert my USD to bitcoin and move it elsewhere?
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:04:26
yeah ok i thought better of it and cancelled the transfer. so...thanks western union. ha i guess i coulda been out some money if i did actually send bitcoin.  which raises a question - is there a way for bitcoin addresses to be recognizable among friends/family as to confirm someone's identity in scammy email situations like this?  
@_date: 2013-04-29 01:57:14
search around a little this has been mathematically analyzed much better than i can. but basically the answer is trillions upon trillions of years. possibility effectively = zero
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:56:20
what do you enter for the trailing stop order? a percentage? or a set number like "10" - if the price drops 10 from the current then it sells?
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:30:17
so that shows the number of coins being bid/asked at a particular price - could be a combination of orders?
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:12:04
perfect thanks
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:30:31
price stabalizing right around the all-time high seems like a great sign of strength to me. it will likely continue to rise soon - its only been three days since it jumped $40!
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:00:36
No not really, but he's saying don't assume you're going to make money.  We're definitely in this for the money.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:35:56
what is my from address?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:24:31
sellers also have an option to hedge orders so that the dollar amount stays the same. silk road takes the difference - so as long as the whole website doesn't R.U.N.N.O.F.T i think i'd be alrigte
@_date: 2013-08-12 23:09:34
ok. so i buy 2 x $1000 money orders on 3 separate days. and then mail them in - either all once or one day after another. bout 5 days from the first mail in the money should be coming in? all anonymous right so i can buy terroristy things with my bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:55:59
k thanks that worked
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:22:09
hm interesting point. at least half of it is held in escrow i believe so that mitigates some of that risk.
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:31:27
ok so possible malware is still an issue.  what are ways to mitigate this threat less going cold storage? it seems like this would be an issue for anybody who has a cash wallet and isn't storing all of their coins away on an offline computer.
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:39:52
if not for drugs i would have never gotten bitcoins in the first place
