But they aren’t.  RT = journalists installed by the state,  NYT = journalists hirer by management.
RT = run by government
NYT = run by its managers

No I want you to tell me who you think “they” are.  I’m not going to go do research on something for you
@_date: 2018-09-17 15:53:09
I just don’t get how it even crosses your mind that a literal government run newspaper would be anywhere close to a private news paper just because a specific family runs that newspaper.  
We can argue about the merits of the New York Times but Russian Times is literally not comparable in terms of accuracy

Idk why this sub loves the economy crashing.  I’m assuming the price of bitcoin would dip significantly with the economy since people are selling off coins that they were planning on holding/ not buying more?
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:57:32
Lol this guy.  Are you advocating for Mccarthism? The era in American history where many people were ostracized and fired based on no evidence of them actually being communism, just because one person accused them of it? Hmmm
Also I do agree we should get rid of nazis, they are making a comeback and it’s gross.
sure the Nazis were left (I guess, that is a much longer conversation) but socialism didn’t kill Jews, socialism didn’t kill Russians, leaders did.  
I would say the only true deaths would be Maos famine, and any deaths due to economic collapse from poor government operation.
But wait a second! Democratic socialist countries are doing well in Europe right now and are beating the US in pretty much every measure you can measure.
Also what? The left is anti immigrant? People complain that the left is too immigrant friendly? Conservatives are much more anti immigrant than liberals, especially in america

You don’t think there is a difference between a media outlet that is literally ran by the government and one that may have a slight reporting bias?
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:12:36
Hahahahahahaha alright man.  
@_date: 2018-09-12 21:47:18
You guys act like it’s crazy to be skeptical automatically of a media source of a semi-democratic country.  Of course RT is biased for the interests of the Russian state
@_date: 2018-09-27 14:40:19
1. Man you really don’t like socialists Hahahaha.
2.  Why not just say nazis? It sounds like you hate socialist nazis but are fine with modern nazis?
@_date: 2018-09-18 01:56:57
Who are THEY?
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:59:51
Lol it’s because “they” is just a boogie man people are scared of.  
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:55:11
Hmmm no they are not.  CNN does not work for the state.  New York Times may have a “bias” in how they write but Russian Times won’t publish bad news against the government or literal fake news against enemies.  Huge difference
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:57:36
How is blockchain fake?  Bitcoin uses blockchain to function right?
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:46:06
But these are private banks that are giving out loans not attached to any gold, whereas before they could only give out money that they had backed.  
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:05:28
So you can can just create smaller and smaller denominations of bitcoins? How is that a limited supply of bitcoins? 
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:29:43
I just want to hear about the cancer being solved.  Rich people die from cancer all the time?  If THEY had a cure, wouldnt THEY give it to THEMSELVES instead of dying?
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:36:25
Hmmm ya I guess I’m kind of thinking like inflation but that would almost be deflation?
But I just thought that there is only a reasonable number of bitcoin you can go to until it isn’t worth any fiat, assuming the price stayed constant? So wouldn’t that run into my initial problem? That it is tied to a finite number 
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:11:27
Ya definitely man I’m going to get right on that 
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:08:47
The two books you told me to read are considered homeopathy.  But I’m still curious - why do you believe in that kind of research instead of the research that says your two books are wrong?
@_date: 2018-06-01 14:34:44
This portfolio is not diverse in an sense of the word though? If bitcoin goes up, alt coins go up; if bitcoin goes down, alt coins go down
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:18:25
Well with gold a big problem was that if a company needed to expand, it couldn’t because there was a set number of gold pieces.  They couldn’t take out loans from banks because you had to have that gold 
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:03:08
But then you are going to run into the same problem as gold? The economy can’t grow if the only supply of money is fixed.  If there are only 100 bitcoins then the guy that needs one bitcoin is screwed?  
@_date: 2018-06-04 03:46:09
So cancer hasnt been cured, those people just need to have positive thoughts and they will get cured?  
You sound like you do a lot of research and im genuinely curious.  You cited 2 books that say that homeopathy works, but there are thousands of books that say it doesnt.  So why do you believe it does?
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:08:39
Libertarians believe the government should be involved in some places.  I wouldn’t call myself a full libertarian but I like some of their ideas 
@_date: 2018-11-16 16:06:14
And to add on to the person above me, libertarians believe in bringing the power closer to the people where there is (usually) more accountability.  So cities should have more freedom to choose their path instead of the federal government
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:19:25
Gotcha! Misinterpretation hahaha.  But what’s good for the country may be bad for a state.  And the definition of “good for the country” is going to be different for different people.  
Lastly, if every state is doing what it thinks is best and what the majority of its citizens think is best then why would that be bad for the country?
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:26:26
Which is why we have to be careful and create institutions to prevent this.  Smaller regions are extremely susceptible to corruption and capture, but they also the most knowledgeable about what’s going on in their area with their citizens.  It’s a balancing act between  these two principals 
@_date: 2018-11-17 07:46:22
Lol okay.  What am I supposed to fill, define and commit to?
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:47:26
What?  No it isnt.  Whats easier: giving 50 states the ability to run a program, or creating a program that accounts for all the variation in 50 states and still being efficient?  
Some states are going to run it poorly, some states are going to run it well.  Ideally the people in the states running it poorly, look at the states running it well and change their programs.  
My largest roadblock to libertarianism is voter rights.  People need to have the ability to fully voice their concerns
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:09:52
“The best individual answer, is not always the best answer for the group”.  Doesn’t that prove my point? If the federal government wanted to make a policy it’s not going to be good for the group.
If California wants to do one thing and Kansas wants to do another, shouldnt we let them? Instead of forcing California to do Kansas thing and vice versa.
Also the prisoners dilemma would only be relevant if one states decision effected another state, which would make it a federal issue (in this ideal world).
@_date: 2018-11-17 01:10:49
Slavery wasn’t very good for slaves, if they had the ability to vote they would probably vote against it.  Labor standards are in the states interest in a populist government.  Who do you think are the laborers? Cities in California have passed 15 minimum wage laws.  But some states feel like those labor standards hurt so they don’t do that.  Isn’t that great? It would suck if the minimum wage was 15 everywhere 
@_date: 2018-11-17 07:45:42
Okay so states can start putting minimum wages on prison labor and we can see the results of that.  Some states are starting to allow  felons to vote.  Wouldn’t it be super shitty if the federal government said felons can’t vote and banned every state from it?  Idk why allot states to make their own decisions is such a controversial topic
@_date: 2019-01-17 02:05:59
Did you just make an incredibly biased example to prove an entirely different point? Market cap is a great metric, don’t be obtuse 
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:16:21
People need to hold, sell, and spend bitcoin for it to work.  But I definitely get OPs concern, everyone in this subreddit solely focus on holding which is not necessarily the best for the coin.  Balanced approaches for the win
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:24:06
If you think that bitcoin is going to be worth a fuckload wouldnt it be smarter to not use it to pay for things like haircuts?  Im not a crypto expert but that just kind of seems like common sense
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:24:13
Libertarian believes that the local government should be the most powerful mode of government with the state and federal having less and the least amount of power.  They believe that a government should only deal with those issues that are a concern of those affected.  
So for example if California is stealing water from Colorado, that’s a federal issue.  If Los Angeles is stealing water from San Francisco that’s a state issue, and if I’m stealing water from my neighbor that’s a local issue.  
Libertarians also believe that the government should allow individuals to have maximum liberty and prioritize it over other values such as security.  Some libertarians believe the government should correct externalities some think it shouldn’t.  I believe it should
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:59:07
Lol like I can like whatever I want.  Who are you to say whether I am or am not something/like something hahahaha
@_date: 2018-07-14 21:04:31
Ya same, I spent 19k I didnt have only on essentials and now the bank wants me to give the money back to the owner?  Wow what dicks, buy bitcoins
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:24:32
hahahahahaha alright man, totally.  The whole banking system runs the country.  Why dont you elect people who arent controlled by the banks?  
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:23:39
Do you seriously not trust any politician? Jesus they are just normal people
@_date: 2018-07-22 00:06:55
Alright.  Do I trust politicians? No.  Am I going to give up the dollar and turn everything I own into bitcoin? No.  Jesus guys, it’s just a currency 
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:54:25
No man I totally agree, shit is fucked up! Let’s change it through the political process, voting for individuals who agree with changing the system
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:57:26
Eh I think that’s both true and untrue.  Gotta look at the individual candidate
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:33:43
Income inequality is actually very bad for the taxpayer.  If you look at it from a pure coat basis, paying for preventive measures is often much cheaper than reactive measures.  High school graduation is much cheaper than prison. Giving people a place to stay is much cheaper than having homeless.  Giving people the ability to use clinics and such for free is much cheaper than them using the emergency room.
Thus the taxpayer gets benefits from paying for things, even if they don’t actually use the service.
Lastly, just don’t be a dick.  I always laugh when people paying taxes ask what’s in it for them.  Is it really too much to ask that you pay like $1 to make sure the guy down the street doesn’t lose his home? Like damn people, your tax requirement is always a % of your income so be grateful you pay a lot in taxes, it’s better than getting money from the government I guarantee it 
@_date: 2018-07-14 20:19:05
So they just received 19k and didnt notice?  like ya the bank is at fault but come on, you should have some sort of financial sense.
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:05:30
Also when people say “oh Facebook lost this much value in a day”. The stock just dipped for a second, not many people actually sold and soon enough it will be going even higher.
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:22:54
Oh i know, these posts are just absurd
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:56:37
Seriously fuck citizens united! But there are still some hold out candidates!!!!
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:02:17
So what about those politicians that voted against banker interests?
