Its merits are that it was hostile for absolutely no reason:


I rarely post in or and I am once again reminded why.

Oh dear. I'm not an advocate for BCH at all, was a completely neutral comment. Clearly you are not willing to discuss.

Late to this thread. But if this is true, then BTC (not just BCH) as it was envisioned is doomed. The whole philosophy behind BTC is to carefully balance the incentives for each participating party.
If it turns out that this is so inbalanced when it scales that another layer is needed, then BTC as a project has failed (except in the research sense, as it has propelled further research).

You get your own IBAN with Revolut too. Fidor looked promising, but I just phoned them and they confirmed that the transfer will come from the name of Fidor, not your own name :(
I think all of these "virtual" bank accounts will be the same - they don't actually give you your own account. You can receive money using your own name, but when you send it will be coming from the bank.

That's weird. I guess I'll try sending a small amount to BTC-e as a test. Thanks for the info - I'll let you know if it works.

Yeah exactly, previously I've bought on Localbitcoins but it's really expensive.
I have just found another option: 
As far as I can tell, you can use it to buy a BTC-e "code", which you then redeem on BTC-e for USD credit.
For example, at the moment, BTC-e price is about $2150. To get $2150 worth of credit, you have to pay £1720 on Unichange right now. That's much cheaper than any UK price.
I can't find info on Unichange though. So don't how reputable they are. And I would worry that the BTC-e code just doesn't work.
