Thanks for the info... 
How long does it normally take for ID to be verified with these sites as waiting for bittylicious. Managed to get it up to maximum 0.2...

Bittylicious is saying i can only buy 0.098 bitcoins.  I am looking to buy 0.55.  Is there anyway to do this quickly?

Thanks alot people, 
I have started verifying myself and this is now starting to increase my limit.  
Just to confirm.
I find a rate that i am happy with. I send a domestic faster payment to the sort code and account number provided with the amount that would give me 0.55.  I provide an address for my wallet.  I log onto my wallet a while later and the 0.55 bitcoins should be appearing there and then i can transfer the bitcoins to another address to make my game purchase?
what is the best wallet to go for if you do not mind me asking.

I understand the there is risks.  Thats why i have requested information from people that have experience in buying bitcoins.  As soon as i buy the bitcoins i plan on buying games with them ASAP would this lower the risk?  I have registered for an account with bittylicious and it is still only offering 0.098.

Thanks alot for your help.  Is it a UK sort code and account number where you send the payment, i guess they give you a reference so it credits your wallet?  Is bittybot also a wallet?  How quickly are the coins received?
