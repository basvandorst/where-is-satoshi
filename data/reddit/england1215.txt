@_date: 2019-08-09 14:31:15
you are going to have to provide way more information than that... are you trading? sending money to unknow addresses? or do you have a hole in your pocket and does you spare change keep falling out?

no because a fork to a higher level of encryption to keep up with what ever speed of decryption would be fine.

yeah but that wouldn't be too noticeable, he only takes about $3.50

no, keep your gold. get a second job if needs be to pay for bitcoin purchases
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:45:39
it is always a scam, if you get in early and get out early you might be able to reap some benefits but they always shut down and leave with a bunch of peoples btc.

 **If we say that fiat will gradually decrease in value in upcoming years, how this can be massively adopted? Lets say I wanna buy a drink with my cash and today’s cost is 5 USD, next month if remains the same, technically if USD looses value my drink will be less expensive...**

who has the lower fees for the end user and yourself? or are they the same
@_date: 2019-09-13 16:41:38
you could find someone who has a bank that works and give them cash
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:40:26
you are unable to get the BTC or any other crypto out of robin hood, so for a long term solution not good, i guess if you just wanted to get in low and sell higher and get out it would be an ok solution.
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:18:32
start by checking your router logs and see if packets are being blocked or the firewall is blocking traffic to the pools IP address. then work your way back through the OSI model layers until you find the culprit.
