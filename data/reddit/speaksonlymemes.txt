All states have rulers. Even the USA has devolved into steep oligarchy.  Every state on earth has an explicit ruler or a practical one.  I can't think of a single exception.  The Magna Carta did not rid of us of that. Not did the US Constitution.  
Above you stated that Bitcoin will not replace fiat.  Sure the Church and the post office still exist but they can be easily bypassed. Such is the fate for fiat money and ultimately the state altogether.
Is it possible to live without a state? Start imagining so.  It has to come to be that none possess the lethality and cruelty that that institution possesses. Cruelty and violence are not justice.  War is a game of power not righteousness. Truth requires an absence of authority not the assertion of it.  
You will only interfere with the inevitability of the deletion of the divine rights of Windsor, Putin or Xi if you don't at least stand down in your defense of the most despicable human invention, the state.

I do want money and finance cleaved from the state.  I  know how state money works and I know how cryptocurrency works.  The good news for both you and me is that neither the state nor Bitcoin can prevent the other's existence.  It is sufficient for my purposes that cryptofinance exists (It still needs to grow some, but that is happening). Stone age? Quite the opposite.  
If you prefer to wallow in bloody slave money, be my guest.  If I prefer this neutral protocol, I  am free to do so.  As are you.  
Anyway I do hope that you will take a step back to consider that you are hopelessly gaslit.  The Democrats are disgusting just as The Republicans are.  To accept one abuser over the other especially when they both serve the same powers is pathetic. There are other options.  For your own sake.

That's beside the point.  I get the argument that money supply should  be elastic so that economic growth doesn't lead to deflationary pressure on the currency.  I  disagree with it but I understand it.  
The point is that some people get the benefit of free money and others bear the cost.  That's larceny and slavery.

I really like this type of conversation but I think it would be better for the author to stick with one topic per article.  
Equilibrium of the Nash variety is reached when competing players in a competitive game know enough about the others' strategies that they reach an unspoken stable bargain.  
In the game of fiat money competition, the US bank-state strategy is pretty clearly to create world unipolar dominance of the currencies under its auspices (USD, Euro, Yen, CdnD, Pound, Franc, AusD and many more). Competition is not tolerated.  States who attempt to compete are destroyed.  
Additionally the few standing competitors are not substantially differentiated in their goals.  All central banks compete against their own citizens.  
So only considering the game of central banks does not portray a Nash type equilibrium.  Despite the author's claim that central banks reveal their strategies through "forward guidance," even casual observation should reveal that their entire business model is to lie, lie and lie more.  The Cantillon effect which describes today's increasingly  oligarchical conditions shows the result.  Things are clearly not in equilibrium.  
Bitcoin creates a protocol open to any person's use.  There is no compulsion to use it or not to use it.  It is not associated with any state actor.  
This creates a radical shot across the bow of central banks and a radical potentiality to corral central banks into a true Nashian Equilibrium.  Bitcoin's strategy is open, non-state associated, has no barriers and is absolutely neutral.  And it can not be defeated by state shenanigans.  Eventually the bank-state will be compelled to compete with Bitcoin.  That is, as more and more people choose a fair, open, non-hierarchical, non-censorable value store and transfer, banks will have to emulate this.  This makes their lies more constrained and their strategies more transparent (though not open). 
Then we can foresee a world not dominated by a one world hierarchy where a few trillionaires dictate to the rest of us what we should value (their currency!) while their power increases via printing their scrip. 
Here is to Misters Turing Nash and Nakamoto.

Money is about confidence.  
Do you really have confidence in government? The most confidence inspiring governments are actually the ruthless ones.  Democracies are clown shows and the Republic of USA has devolved to a theatre between oligarchy and clown show.  
Gold is divine but lacking in many ways.  The quantity is unknown. It has no native digital transaction capability. It is difficult to verify.
I  think this blockchain stuff is by far the most confidence inspiring in its basic qualities.  The social acceptance just keeps self-reinforcing. 
I am a semi-Bitcoin maximalist. Only Monero has better base properties but it highly lacks the same social acceptance.

You can try to pigeonhole me but I know myself. 
I am no middle roader. I am far away from left-right or middle.  I find no interest in any of those corrals.  
Russia has an interest in US politics. So does Canada. Just as every country has varying interests in every other country. Get over it.  The Democrat candidate also had significant involvement with Russia (and Saudi Arabia and Israel and and and...) You really can't be this naive. I have seen all that evidence.  It's not good but it isn't nearly as damning as it is against the process crimes of the Democrats in my opinion. The Steele Dossier was fake and paid for by Democrats.  Comey knew it, Mueller knew it. That makes the whole thing criminal and farcical.  If a cop arrests you under faked pretense, nothing he finds subsequent matters.  Do you understand that principle?  The process crimes are far greater than the political interference. The media frenzy just reveals it is all obviously gamed.  The process crimes are real.  But your wilful partisan blindness won't let you see that. 
Speaking of political interference, how do.you feel that Alphabet Corp (Google, YouTube) was the top corporate donor to Mrs. Clinton for 2016? I  suppose you are unaware or more likely don't care that they are clearly manipulator of opinion. 
Shut the southern border completely of any crossing using the military in the short term and more cost effectively a physical barrier in the long term.  Millions are crossing per year and already 10% of the US population is undocumented illegal aliens (many who vote!!!) Free healthcare for all of them! Disaster. The economic resources are not available now to care for all current Americans. I  am not against providing some health insurance for poor people.  It would be cruel not to.  I  am against state compelled universality.  
Are you seriously not aware of the depersoning of people from media?  No one gets to choose who speaks or what is spoken.  Alex Jones is low brow, narrow band and blunt and is so often incorrect that he isn't worth the time.  Should he be disconnected from commerce by the banks? You tell me. Milo Yanopolis? Laura Loomer? etc etc etc etc etc?  Not a problem for you is it?  Is it?  I  get the impression that you might not even be aware of it.  Either way, that you are in the dark or accept or approve of limiting speech, you delight in your gaslit existence.   Funny how liberals used to advocate for free speech.
CNN is garbage mostly, so is Fox. All centralized media become garbage and tools of abuse, including Youtube,Twitter and Facebook.  It is not easy getting clean information.  I try to get a good array and try to consider only facts, but that is a real challenge. 
I  am  for a much more free world.  I don't see that on offer from any politician.

He was harassed by the US government and even institutionalized. 
He was schizophrenic by not dangerously. 
His crime?  He published a proof that showed that in the arms race between cryptography and deciphering cryptography, cryptography trivially wins.  That is, given  the state of technology of any time, cryptography can not be defeated even with enormously asymmetrical resources.  
This means that the common man can keep secrets from the state. He thought this would be of high interest to the US government, who then pursued him as a pariah.  
The movie The Beautiful Mind was objected to by him and is a propaganda piece.  Nice movie. I  really liked it until I found out the truth.

Whew.  Well then go ahead and create some blockchain and let me know if anybody else values the coins.  Or go ahead and create Bitcoins. They will have to comply with the rules which means you will compete with miners and therefore will spend a lot of money and energy in the process.  Bitcoin mining is expensive.  
You seem to think that because Bitcoins are transferred weightlessly that they are not expensive to create.  They are.  Those data entries in the Bitcoin blockchain are very secure due to that energy expenditure.  That is the furthest thing from thin air.

Ok. But this is a man who was chemically castrated by the state because he loved against the state prescribed manner.  
Nothing holds as much potency for the eventual defeat of the state than computation and cryptography.  
Note that there is not a Turing-coin (even Turing-complete Ethereum does not use his brand).
We can rightly think that it is ironic that a man who, more than any other singular man, gave the Americans an island to launch D-day from preserving  freedom in Western Europe, who was then so grotesquely abused by the state is now a celebrated symbol of the state.

So I said I  would get back to you... 
On the question of how will we get along in the absence of a state, the following are some of my thoughts:
Most importantly, it just doesn't matter.  This is a moral argument. The immorality inherent in the notion of the state is enough to drop the existence of the state.  A permit for mass murder, imprisonment (and subsequent license to rape provided to stronger inmates) given to some is not a good solution to any problem.  The consequences that you fear are really secondary. Lawlessness by a few in order to create order makes no moral (or practical) sense.  I  trust that you can see the grotesque consequences of trusting fallible but self interested humans with the power of the state.  I guess I would say it is up to you to demonstrate some compensating improvement from those atrocities.  
Secondly, the mechanisms for the individual to trust that rules will be followed and contracts honoured are now abundant.  There are almost no secrets now.  In any city, the whereabouts of any vehicle or cell phone are trivially known.  As are any audible sounds or utterance via text can  attributable to you.  It is not much of a reach to the point that it is well known what any person does.  Standards of behaviour need not be set by instruments as blunt as politics.  Information, reputation and sanction via insurance would cover most scenarios. If you were to purchase insurance against you committing what we call crime today, people could verify that and trust you far more than the trust that a police car might show up in time.  I  would have the choice to associate with you or not based on the condition of your insurance and reputation.  Law and punishment are really a catch all lowest common denominator insurance as it is today.  I  suppose there might be left some iota for taxers to still do something I  that regard.  
This is a Bitcoin forum. I  hope you know that this is a great example of regulation which is an enormous improvement over the corrupted stupidity  and violence of the regulation of "The Financial System."   When the last Bitcoin price peak and crash happened there was a tremendous explosion of absolutely novel financial applications sprouting. Enough variety to supplant money, debt, equity and insurance plus a whole array of types completely unavailable without blockchains.   Blockchains are also better at registering ownership.  There are problems to be solved such as the "oracle problem" but that is a tiny gap as compared to trusting Donald Trump (or Kamala Harris or Boris Johnson or Justin Trudeau, bleccch to all of them) Oracles are simply testament to the real world conditions that smart contracts pay on. Human oracles themselves can be made prone to blockchains, reputation and insurance.  As Bitcoin emerges from price winter, so will all those concepts and much more.  
In terms of implementation, I just think if you starve the beast slowly the innovation will take care of itself.  But it would be.important to choose which public enterprises can be abandoned first, which will be more prone to some of these solutions.   Unfortunately, it will probably come down to crisis.  When the ability to borrow money from future generations (via money printing) loses the underlying economy that it needs.   With all due respect, a good part of the blame for the crisis is intelligent people like yourself continuing to swallow the gaslighting when the moral and economic unsustainability are staring at you point blank.

Hashrate is directly proportional to the real world value of the block reward.  Hashrate follows price.   Price follows aggregate user preference.  Developers can offer implementation options but users are not beholden to use these options. 
Users choose the protocol via price.  Miners will follow reward.  Miners have no power or say in choosing the protocol.  Nor can they attack the blockchain except in some highly uneconomic fraud.

Your last sentence is the Bitcoin potential to bring all fiat currencies in line to an approximation of Nashian Equilibrium.  Bitcoin's strategy is open and without human corruption.  In order to compete for the faith that money requires, they can no longer get away with gaslighting their livestock into accepting their costless scrip.  (who actually fell for Mnuchin's performances?)   If they are to survive at all, they will need to be a lot more open about their agendas.  That is the very essence of Nashian Equilibrium.  The fact that Mnuchin openly stated twice this week that US National Security depends upon the USD being top global reserve asset is already an open statement of strategy. A wicked and bloody strategy but Nash Equilibrium only requires that the competing players know each other's strategy, not any morality.

1) Russiagate.  That is an absolute joke.  The only thing interesting it revealed is a mountain of process crime committed by law enforcement, judiciary and Mr. Obama.  High crime and abuse by Democrats.  All fake drama.  That the Steele Dossier was paid for by Democrat money or that various top law enforcers knew that and proceeded anyway should have halted the whole process. That it ever had political legs is due to gaslighting and complicity of media.  Swallow deep. 
2) The Clintons. War criminals each. Serial murderer of inconvenient people. Mongers of state secrets. Information security failures. Child traffickers. Sexual deviants. Surrounded by pedophiles.

Bitcoin is not created out of thin air.  It is created by very particular rules which are accepted by the users of the coin.  The users trade real resources for the artefacts of the rules.  This protocol in some ways parallels the rules of fiat Money, at least in terms of numeric accounting.
The rules that create fiat are far more corruptible and corrupted.  No amount of assets (or liabilities) constrains the quantity of dollars.  Most assets controlled by the government are only assets inasmuch as they might be valued by private enterprise.  Government operations, by definition, operate at a loss and would otherwise have negative valuation.

I think he pursued the idea of ideal money as a natural extension of his Equilibrium Theories.  
Ideal money neuters political money.  But his pursuit was flawed.  It assumed that the masters of fiat were motivated for general human well being rather than the slavers that they are.  
His real contributions to the idea of money are that a political economy can be defeated by an anarchistic one because power is neutralized (equilibrium theory) and that cryptography will trivially outrun deciphering  (with all due respect to Mr. Turing).  If the Axis powers had developed computation algorithms and computers first, it would be a different world.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:20:00
I  would agree with much of what you have said if the states of the world were to admit to their crimes and compensate for them. Britain is headed by a family and banking clan that is worth Trillions of dollars.  A corporation does not get away from its liabilities just because times change.  
It is not me that has drawn the line that says, "I am your ruler and you shall obey."  I have not chosen the "they and us" paradigm. I  would demolish that due to its moral illogic.  
I  would say that the most important project for humanity is how to have a modicum of peace and morality without the most unpeaceful and immoral institution devised.  
Separation of money from state is a good start.
Perhaps you think the vast suffering of the 20th Century and the far more vast potential suffering embodied in  the current bank-state has little to do with the imposition of the "ruler-subject" line that is drawn by the sovereigns.

@_date: 2019-07-15 17:49:14
The movie of course is a simplification. But it skips the most important elements of his life.  He proved that cryptography done correctly can always outrun deciphering which is  a potent threat to the notion that some will have secrets carefully tended by stone walls and guards while the vast remainder will not.  He was violently arrested and institutionalized. He later stopped trying to emphatically convince people and in words I remember  reading and paraphrase here, just went along with things quietly in order to avoid jail. He quit his medications.  So the movie is rife with lies. Big ones. Not leastly treating his crypto proof (with enormous implication for those that have power, the end of power really) as lunatic rantings. He was schizophrenic but he was not wrong about that.
Since you are of the rare sort that can disagree agreeable, riddle me this:

Are you referring to a Bank's ability to reverse a transaction in the event of some dispute like theft or fraud?
If so that is a feature of that bank money is a product of a contract  and is actually thereby not money but currency.  This is a feature of the bank being a body corporate capable of forming contract.  Bitcoin certainly can not form contracts. (lol as you kids say)., but a Bitcoin bank  sure could. There are even some limited function semi automated escrow smart contracts that can hypothetically not clear funds until the parties are satisfied.

@_date: 2019-07-20 18:32:20
I  was hoping the author would take his reasoning a few steps further.  
Nash Equilibrium does not  really apply in a world of only central banks.  Even if they are largely competing, they are still a limited set of actors with interests quite closely aligned and fairly divergent from the interests of most other players that use their money.  They do not openly reveal their strategies.  If people study the inflation/deflation cycle of the 1970s and 1980s, they might lose some of the current confidence that the central banks always inflate.  It is this incorrect confidence that causes great cost to those who assume they know central bank future actions.   Central banks also largely coordinate; some people declare that they are mostly ultimately one bank. 
However in a world with Bitcoin, the potency of central bank "surprise" is greatly diminished.  
Open source code, a vast array of coins, ad hoc participation, no counterparty, global reach all add up to the ability of the individual to act outside of the corral of the local legal tender.  This is the source for equilibrium.  
It frees the individual from the effects of bankers acting in their own selfish interests.  So the potency of the bank strategy is zero to the Bitcoiner.  
Banks can not interfere with the commerce of Bitcoiners.  (That the likes of bankers are to judge on morality is pretty rich!) 
Most importantly the open protocol of Bitcoin means that Bitcoin has no agenda.  It can always be used to escape the agenda of The Bank.  So we no longer are prone to the unknown strategy of The Bank.  
The Bank then must in turn become much more trustworthy as the individual has a way out. The Bank's strategy is then far more known.   Therein is a closer approximation to Nashian Equilibrium.

This is not quite true.  Once the gold standard of Breton Woods was abandoned, the money printing and inflation ran high.  Confidence in fiat was nearly lost.  The Central banks instituted 20% interest rates to kill inflation.  In the 1980s', so it was not a continuum as you suggest.
"Inflation is always a monetary phenomenon." --Milton Friedman
Don't imagine that it is impossible for that happen again.  The quantity of currency is under tight central control and whichever direction leads to most profit for those in control will happen.  Inflation is hand feeding the wild ducks.  Deflation is autumn harvest. 
What should terrify you is that you can be ruined by either effect and it is at the whim of nasty nasty people

It is not only very expensive of capital for a rogue cartel of miners to get that hashpower, double spends are expensive of operating cost..   
The cost of rewriting the chain to reverse that number of blocks is proportional to the block reward (even exceeding it when Bitcoin prices are decreasing). The block reward is worth about $125,000. 
So if the recipient waits 10 confirmations, (less than 2 hours), the cost of the attack is in the order of 125 BTC.  $ 1.25M USD plus other risks of being a thief.

Eventually they will.  
The Bitcoin scaling debate proved that Bitcoin  can not be defeated by evil millionaires.  Libra will prove that Bitcoin can not be defeated by evil billionaires.  When we do get Fedcoin, it will be proven that Bitcoin  can not be defeated by evil trillionaires.  
The user can choose whatever protocol he wants, trillionaires be damned.  
So unless it's more user agnostic than Bitcoin or Monero, the user will never choose Fedcoin.  And if it is more anarchistic than Bitcoin, they will have ended their own game.  
Game Over.

No. There is nothing hypothetical about what I said about fiat banks or about Bitcoin as a protocol.  Those are real. Additional indeed there are Bitcoin "banks" already emerging that offer fiat point of sale conversion (Coinbase does this among several) and, wait for it... reversability of the transaction in case of dispute.  This is rare in comparison to the general fiat world, but it exists.  
The difference that you seem to be really trying hard to not accept is that companies  (banks, both fiat and Bitcoin)with balance sheets can reverse transactions. The Bitcoin protocol can not.
