The greatest minds babble endlessly. Ponder that.

That's the beauty of it, platform independent, eradicating threats from multiple operating system environments, continuously cleaning the internet effectively stopping the propagation.
This coin is going to be the Neo of the Matrix.

Technology is only limited by imagination. Don't make me quote Jules Verne.
This isn't science fiction, guys/haters.

Well, opinions are like assholes, everybody has one, and most stink.
If you can't actually, factually, prove me wrong aren't you just another closed-minded innovation inhibitor?
It's "magic" if it does something amazing that you can't wrap your head around.

I didn't realize that you already attempted this and hit a solid wall indicating that this technological feat isn't possible. Oh wait, you didn't, and you've just admitted in a roundabout way that you're a negative nelly put on this earth to stop or slowdown advancements to better humanity.

Well there's definitely more than one way to skin a cat, and frankly the project can turn directions at this stage.
One day soon you will have a Bitcoin/Litecoin replacement that actively protects devices supporting it's network.
Use your imagination.

Well, at what point in the millennia are we at, Really? Skepticism is healthy, but come on now people.

I was actually going to use the god analogy in my previous message, so I totally agree with you there.
This conversation made you think. You're interested in this topic. I take that as a sign to keep moving forward. =)

I think this is a novel idea; I mentioned it to a mfc model I know and she's signing up. Looks like more talent is coming your way. =)

You're over-thinking it while simultaneously under-thinking it. A phenomenon more common in engineering than you think, or over-think. Picture a gear magically moving, powered by the people. That's the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:07:15
You have to see the blockchain for what it's worth. While it performs what you say, at it's core it's performing work. This work, provided there's some sort of perceived value, will undoubtedly be accommodated by the masses and inevitably sustained, regardless of efficiency, Bitcoin for example.
Now, how do you connect the dots? Well, in your mathematical mind, can you phrase the activity of say an anti-virus program into a series of complex mathematical situations where the outcome is POW verifiable and a sector of the internet is clean by it's definition?
Multiple genres of math have to coincide in perfect harmony in order for this to succeed.

That form of thinking is fundamentally flawed and will only hamper your progress. I would've recognized that during the interview and you wouldn't have gotten the job. You should change that.
Enterprise would know what hit them if it were a car, so your analogy is lacking. I would also change that.
Instead of critiquing something you may not have your mind around, how about offering deeper insight into the possibilities. I'd like to learn more, and you seem quite knowledgeable in this particular arena of crypto. What have you?
