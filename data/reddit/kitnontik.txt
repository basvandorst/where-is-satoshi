What happens when you run out of battery???

I have a 8600M GT, which supposedly should net 4.93 Mhash/s, but I only seem to be getting around 1800 khash/s in poclbm. Any ideas?

How exposed it is to speculation right now. The craziness with the USD/BTC exchange right now just makes everything seem like some sort of scam to some, and a get rich quick scheme to others. How the early adopters/miners (again, something else that just makes it look like some sort of get rich quick scam. Make money with GPUs!) own so much of the currency.

No harm done! :) You can bookmark this post if you want so you can look back on the day you "pwned so hard".

Why would people choose to flee to BTC over the dozens of proven, established currencies currently being traded in the world, or even commodities such as gold?
@_date: 2011-06-28 01:49:40
Why do you assume that's going to happen at all?
@_date: 2011-06-16 23:05:48
Yep. I have a 8600M GT, and the guide says 8600M GT 	4.93 (I copy pasted this, this is not a typo).
Not that I was expecting to get rich on my 2008 laptop GPU, but still.

More like Engadget on Bitcoins.

You are clinging onto the past too much... Accept that things change... And so do my posts.

 You on the other hand seem to have trouble moving on.

They know they killed Bitcoin as their volumes dropped dramatically after their catastrophic crash... Now they're trying to get people back on board... Infuriating and pathetic. Good job, Magic The Gathering Online Exchange.

In a world where BTC is actually used as a currency, sure.

They also said Abraham Lincoln was dead. Well he is.

Do you live in 2030?

What I want to understand is why we need a dark pool in the first place, if it's not a way to deceive small investors.

People getting angry on the Internet.
@_date: 2011-07-02 15:45:52
Yeah, sorry if we are a bit apprehensive about a website with such a great history.

3% is too similar to what VISA &amp; Co. already practice, and might put off people that were relying on the whole "no transaction fees" characteristic of Bitcoin. I suggest lowering that to 1% or less, which would strengthen your moral ground. Of course I am not taking into account whatever business model you are running on.

no decent place to sell your music online? try bandcamp and tunecore

Yeah brah. Bitcoins are definitely worth 15$.
