Not zero sum since expanding market cap means everyone can win. It's literally the definition of wealth Creation

ITT: Prof bought BTC and has the perfect audience 
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:16:09
I think you're missing my point. As long as market cap is growing, it is not a zero sum game. The only way it is zero sum is if bitcoin drops back to $0, then the amount won will be equal to the amount lost.
As an easy example, imagine the first guy bought BTC at $100 and sold to the second guy at $1000, who sold to the third guy at $10k, who sold to the fourth guy at $14k. 
In that example, all four have "won" money. It's no zero-sum

And yet, with all this demand for Lambos, their price might actually go up 
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:24:30
BTC is considered a capital asset and not a currency in the US. So if you trade your huge gains for a lambo or a mansion, thats taxed just as if you cashed out to fiat. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:44:06
At this point I think its safe to rule out an overnight trip to 20k 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:18:14
Nah I doubt it. Might go up, but bonuses won't be the cause. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:09:56
I doubt the banks straight up lent him money to go play with bitcoin. I can see two ways to do this: first, have a house with no mortgage, and then take a mortgage against 80% of the house. Or second, have a house with equity and refinance. 
But whatever you do, don't tell the bank you're taking it out to go play with bitcoins
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:45:51
its almost like everyone already owns btc and we are running out of n00bs
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:14:37
The thing is, if something goes wrong with my online bank then I just call the bank, and they've always fixed any concerns I have (which isnt even often). With BTC, it sounds like there's some pitfalls which can cause the BTC to disappear permanently. I'm a long term hodler, but I'm very hesitant to actually make transactions or move my BTC to cold storage because I'm afraid I'll send them somewhere and not be able to find them anymore. Perhaps stupid, but I'd rather not lose $. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:36:12
Good post. Arent CME futures cash settled, DAILY? That means that he expiration of a futures contract wouldnt have a huge effect because if you are up, or down, you already had to post the cash on prior days. Its not a “built up” postion the way an option might be.
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:26:49
Why are you even studying finance since it only deals w fiat anyways? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:48:16
Thanks. I will check out that sub and might hit you up. At the moment I'm content to hodl,  but I'd like to move to a nano s sometime this spring so that's when I'll need to research transactions in more depth

Just saying, the dollar has given a lot of people a high quality of life, myself included, so I find it a bit hard to root against it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:55:44
Not much but people just desperate to make a narrative. The thinking is that the market is being manipulated down so the futures holders can profit on the last day,but there's no evidence other than gossip
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:54:00
This is good for Bitcoin. Everything is good for Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:12:35
I doubt the banks follow up on how you use the money. In exchange for the loan (which is really just a mortgage) their two primary considerations are 1) the value of your house and 2) whether you receive a pay check every two weeks that is sufficient to make the monthly payments. 
Basically you'd be leveraging a combination of your house and your future earnings.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:34:03
Just curious, why would you do that?

Lol that's actually a clever strategy. Rather than figuring out which coins to hodl, just be the guy selling Lambos to the winners

You better check with a tax professional but I am 75% sure you are actually incorrect 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:57:31
Yeah thats the hardest part. I have no doubt there will be SOME bounce in the next day or two, the only question is whether the bounce will be sustained long/strong enough to make it worth buying into...

Not sure, but given that market orders are typically executed pretty much instantaneously, I would imagine you don't really see it in the order book but you might see it under the"trade history" section 
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:36:33
I'm not sure what you mean - can you elaborate? And just to clarify the point that I think I'm trying to make - if you own BTC futures, you have to settle the price change daily I think...is that not true? What does the daily settlement refer to? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:05:18
It was more sarcasm I dont think that people trying to rationalize this as tax selling are being logical. 
If I had to make up a tax related reason, id say a lot of sellers didn't want to sell in December to avoid piling up 2017 taxes. 
But none of that really means BTC is going back to 20k anytime soon 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:54:11
Relative to a week ago obviously :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:03:09
I think the concept of a leveraged BTC ETF was not disclosed previously. Those sound like fun to play with

I jumped yesterday...pretty glad I did. Still got eth and might buy back btc but at the moment BTC looks pretty fucked 
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:07:07
Eh, we got to borrow a lot of $ and inflate our way out of debt because the USD is the reserve currency 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:42:58
Probably selling so they can buy even more. This is good for BTC in the long run 
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:45:28
I doubt this will move the needle
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:58:39
Yeah, if the 4th guy is left holding the bag (e.g. BTC = $0), then its zero sum. But if BTC stabalizes at $14k then the first 3 made money and the 4th guy broke even. Its simply not zero sum. 
And you really can't count the 1st guy's missed opportunity as zero sum, because he would have had to hold btc for a while to realize the remaining 13.9k, but instead he got his money back and had the opportunity to use it for something else - perhaps an even more profitable altcoin, or maybe a life necessity like paying car insurance, etc. 
BTC growing is no different than AAPL growing. In both cases, wealth is created. The only real question is the ending - does the bubble pop? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:09:44
Its not a rumor, its an easily verifiable fact 
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:00:53
Trade your fiat for it. Fiat is worthless anyways 
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:09:12
You mist not be American, huh?
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:17:11
We might have to agree to disagree. The value of BTC is whatever the current market rate is. Of course it's possible that we look back one day and say BTC was worthless all along, but as of today there are plenty of people willing to pay 14k for it. You have to measure it by it's current value, just like apple is measured by it's current value. 
Your examples of buying a pen or  buying a car are irrelevant because you are implying people paying something other than the current market rate. If someone paid 100k for BTC today, then they'd be a loser by 86k. If someone paid 14k for a $1 pen, they'd be losers too. But buying BTC at 14k today doesn't make you a loser since you can immediately sell it for 14k if you change you mind. Paying market rate for any product does not make you a loser. 
Lastly, BTC growing in value is the exact same as every other asset growing in value. Yes it's true that apple has an underlying company which has evolved, but that doesn't matter. People want to pay 14k for BTC today, it's as simple as that...if you listen to people on this board, then apparently BTC is going to 100k soon. Who cares if the underlying BTC hasn't changed? People pay for expensive art work, and it's value rises too, even though the painting remains the same 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:33:14
Got it, thanks. Do I need to do that before the 28th, or anytime? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:20:15
BTC has gotten way to big (in terms of market cap and volume) to be sustained by retail individuals pumping their gift $$$ into it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:36:55

Its a very elegant argument but I see some flaws with it. First, it is said that electricity should be used in areas where it is cheap...but there is no mention of possible alternative uses for the electricity, expspecially the possibility that the electricity could be used to further imorove human living conditions. The argument glosses over that as basically saying "well its cheap so they must nit like electricity so the best thing we can do is mine btc with it." 
Second - and this is more important to btc holders - it does nothin pg to address future scenarios where the cheap electricity becomes expensive. I think the video vaugely implies that miners will just go somewhere else...but...not sure I buy it

I'm with you on that. I'm looking at the 17750 range as being pretty critical support based on the 1day chart. Somehow I have a bad feeling its gonna crash through and drop to the 12-15 range, but so far its holding which is good I guess 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:08:49
It looks kind shaky to me, but I guess we can each have our opinion. I like ETH. Beyond that, I'm vaguely interested in XRP and IOTA, and barely interested in Dash or Monero even though I don't understand them particularly well at the moment. What are your thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:09:04
I just want that feeling of ripping up again :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:29:18
I doubt its intentional. They are probably getting hit with way more volume than they can handle. They were in the perfect place at the perfect time - making $ off transactions from a very popular product to trade. The problem is that they are relatively young and can't handle the 100k+ sign ups, and all the transactions that come with it. 
I don't carry the flag for them or anything, but they really look like someone who is overwhelmed. 
Also, there isn't really a great motive for manipulating. They're already in prime position to profit from all this trading. They are win-win since they make money regardless of price...do you really think they ALSO want to expose themselves to price risk?

@_date: 2017-12-01 17:15:25
Yeah thanks, my disconnect comes from the fact that people on this sub continue to imply that BTC will be driven down by short selling, which is different than saying you have a negative Delta position. 
Having futures will not make it easier to short BTC, which is a bit more complicated at the moment than shorting other stuff 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:54:38
This market can't catch a bid for more than an hour at a time. You'll probably see much cheaper in the next few days. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:04:21
Probably because that's exactly when they get flooded with panic sell orders. Also, I dont recall them halting anything prior to the BCH addition. I suspect Coinbase is probably pretty fucked on a technical level right now. Probably tons of young 20-something software coders getting yelled at right now because their shit doesnt work 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:57:14
I'm with you. I think we're talking about the same thing. I'm trying to learn more about the short interest in BTC and there isn't much info available. I don't even think large scale shorting is possible since nobody wants to lend their BTC for obvious reasons 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:03:31
Hope youre right. The volume has been good at the bottom. That said I just dont really see any buying pressure, but I hope I'm wrong on that! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:48:33
The only thing you can "do" is take what the market gives you. Unless you got a few extra billion sitting around, you wont change the course of btc...if youre worried, diversify and add some altcoins
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:01:56
So I guess your view is that by keeping the futures price low, the market will adjust and the price of the underlying will drop accordingly? That's a logical point I just want to understand what you're saying. I don't think you're saying that you will (hypothetically) drive the price of BTC by shorting BTC, are you? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:11:56
Haha I wanna know where the support trends are though 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:44:12
I think an ETF would move the needle much more than the futures did (or, the futures didnt, as the case may be). An ETF deals directly in BTC, whereas the futures are all cash settled and therefore have no direct, true connection to BTC (except arbitrage). 
Also an ETF on the NYSE would open BTC to basically every American with a stock account, including retirement accounts. Not saying every American would buy, but the gates would then be wide open to at least the possiblitly.

Ive read a lot about LN and one question that persists is this. My understanding is that you have to keep $ committed to a channel...thereby limiting the number of open channels you can ever have, and also limiting the amount you could spend on one channel (since I would presumably want like ten equal channels open) 
Nobody has been able to answer that...I dont know if its because Im dense or there just isnt a good answer
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:41:34

Hmm awesome, thanks. The replay protection, I believe, refers to the potential issue of spending one of the coins and having someone "replay" the transaction for your other coin, since they are duplicates of each other 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:40:55
I think there some fear that BTC capitulated to the upside. Once every kid with their grandma's Xmas money is in the market, then there aren't any new buyers coming and it becomes time to sell. It's the greater fool theory, and we might be running out of new fools to get into the market 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:07:36
lol hindsight is 20/20 man. I have tons of regrets if I think that way...
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:11:38
do whales have eggs?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:12:21
Ok that's a fair enough view point. My opinion is that the technology behind BTC, as well as other alts, is still far enough away from being main stream that there will be massive volatitly in the coin pricing for the next year or two 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:03:51
Right, I agree with your overall point, but ETH and IOTA aren't trading at 15k with 200b+ market cap. At BTC's valuation, there's an expectation that the technology actually works well. Can't talk about mooning BTC to 100k+ and then also say "TX time is all good because it'll get fixed in the future and BTW others suck too" 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:34:02
I got in under .70 but now of course I regret not buying enough haha
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:36:23
Hint: they dont. The "whales" just got blamed when in fact BTC is just volatile. Why is it up 3x since Thanksgiving? Because the whales want it to be? 
Look, the past three or four days have been low volume. GDax is showing something like three days in the 20s and one at 16. For comparison, first week of December was crossing 50000 every day. 
What you should understand from this is that there arent some secret whales pushing massive volume through. In fact the volatility may be coming from the absense of buyers, nothing else. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:34:01
its a pattern but if youre asking how traders interpret it, most of them will tell you to see if it breaches the neckline before trading on it. if it breaches, then its on like donkey kong 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:52:22
It just showed up on your coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:18:19
Yeah looks like next support would be 12k 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:55:02
Coinbase is post-only for the first hour, so might be calm for 67 more minutes. After that, my logic would expect BCH to be sold and $ to move to BTC, but my gut says its gonna be a bloodbath for BTC down to 12k. We'll see
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:36:31
Good question. I imagine the analogy you need to research is stock splits. (Not the 2:1 type, but the scenario where you get stock in a second company, e.g. owning Phillip Morris and receiving Kraft after the spin off).
My best guess, and its really just a guess, is that you take your cost basis for the original BTC and then your gain is the (current value of BTC + current value of BCH)...something like that. BUt yeah, you'll get a tax hit... 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:38:48
I got 6k too, my regret is not getting more 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:33:03
Yes, thats pretty much how every market works. The "walls" are different in each market but the concept is that same
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:28:18
holy f-, massive volume to defend the 13k. Didn't see that one coming :) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:23:52
Good post. I believe BTC price can make a come back but only if the tx issue is resolved - one way or another. Hard to tell people to pay $20k+ per BTC if the technology behind it is only going to be ready "in the future." Look at all the altcoins who have promised but nothing to show as of today - their market caps are nowhere near what BTC was. 
The way I see it, the problem boils down to whether the technology can catch up quick enough, before all the confidence is out. Once confidence is out, its reallyyyy hard to bounce back 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:38:01
Thats your common sense speaking. When demand increases as price increases, then you know its time to rock and roll. The more it costs, the more people fear missing out. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:09:46
Id aim for 60 or so 
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:08:57

@_date: 2017-12-22 21:35:03
I mean, a little bit yeah...haha whats a little fry guy? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:32:48
Fair enough, I understand what youre saying and can respect that viewpoint 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:53:30
til: BTC sub is full of vegetarians 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:21:14
yeah but only if it breaks below the neckline first 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:05:05
probably because no transactions went through at that price. happens on the stock market sometimes too
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:09
Basically it started with some heavy selling pressure, which in turned caused a loss of confidence. Now basically everyone wants out (either to lock in profits, or because the pain of the losses is getting too painful) and there isn't really anyone who wants to get in anymore 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:06:23
They said its post-only for "at least" one hour. I don't think there's been any indication that its going live 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:42:43
I'd bet a lot...I got friends who trade (i.e. trade other people's big $ for a living) and they spend half the day working the phones to get the rumors. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:00:56
Is there any meta data in the word file that tells you what was autocorrected?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:01:21
Sell. I hardly know anythig about it but that return is great and Imsuspect you can get "safer" positions such as btc, eth, or even dash or xrp
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:43:21
I see. Is it implies that this would be good for BTC price, or just a good advance in technology (realizing that the two offen Go hand in hand ) 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:13:29
Unless Zuck buys 3b of BTC...then theyd literally never be able to catch him
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:38:58
Not really. It's the resulting equilibrium between buyers and sellers. That's how every market works. It seems there are tons of people willing to bis between 12-14k, but no buyers above that. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:35:25
Where are they spreading FUD? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:29:55
Can you elaborate? How can a smart contract represent ownership of a car - e.g what links that car to that contract? ETH sounds cool but the notion of smart contracts is just so abstract to me. Loke I can send you title to my car just like sending you a BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:17:59
Whats the impedes for a turn around here? Is there anything that would cause people to think its a good idea to bid this back to 19k? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:42:56
Not trying to rain on your parade, but when are you going to pay back the principal on the loan?
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:04:52
The biggest problem with your analogy is that you confuse believing in one's own ability w believing in something totally beyond your control. If I work hard, I can accomplish many things. If I believe hard, BTC will go up? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:36:58
I'm not necessarily sympathetic to them - they saw the chance to make money, took on customers, and now they can't service them. 
That said, I just don't think this is some sort of conspiracy to build up sell walls. BTC's confidence is broken, thats why all the selling 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:15:48
ETF would be huge. If its anything like existing etfs, it will hold BTC (and possibly some futures). But holding BTC would be important because it means there is a direct path for anyone with a stock account to move money into BTC. In summary, it means that all stock accounts become potential btc buyers, and potential buyers means price increase. ETF would have a bigger effect than futures because its much more widely available (e.g. trading futures is only for wealthier traders) and has a more direct correlation to btc (futures are cash settled and therefore only indirectly able to influence btc)
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:41:47
Kind of, yes. Whats golds cap? Like 8t right? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:14:28
unconfirmed txs down to 192k from a recent high of about 270k. Maybe a slight positive sign 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:01:12
To be clear, the tax bill clarifies that like for loke can only be used for real estate. However, I hink you should carefully research whether the current law allows like for like exchanges on cryptos. My non-accountant understanding is that you could probably never use like for like on cryptos, so that tax bill doesnt change anything
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:56:52
Probably because its too far away. NYSE just filed for it ... in crypto terms, it might as well be a decade away. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:09:39
lol thats awesome! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:46:23
Have you thought about $5 wrenching him yet? Admit it, the thought crossed your mind
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:14:54
Just wait til the first futures expire in January. Volatility is guaranteed, but profits are possible too 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:22:34
Yeah that's what a lot of people are saying, but this seems like a smaller fork so not sure it'll cause much havoc 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:10:05
probably because you owned BTC on the day of the fork. Otherwise maybe they just like you 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:54:11
Isn't the only etf currently available gbtc? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:56:40
Would love to have some sustained buying pressure here. Looks ok, but we've seen this bounce a few times over the past few days. Hopefully this one marks a turn around. 1H chart shorts a doji from 8-9am, with some volume, usually a sign of a turn around in stocks, but who the hell knows w crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:46:54
Yeah, I actually decided early on to hold through this even though I knew it'd be ugly. I'm ok with that. My bigger problem at the moment is that I had a couple of shares of GBTC which were riding real high and are now crashing hard. I know I should have avoided that ETF haha 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:02:46
I mean, according the the IRS its a capital asset not a currency
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:10:41

The real question - was she cute?
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:56:37
Is there a good resource you know which explains how to claim the forked b2x? Ive been hodling on coinbase for a few months now...but dont really know how to use a wallet etc...but obviously want to learn. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:33:59
Yeah, you're right about exchanging BTC for fiat. I didnt think of that 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:14:30
I hope youre right. ... 7k pop would be awesome
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:43:07
This is the coolest thing ive heard today. Lets hear some stories!
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:21:43
I'm thinking it's a coincidence. Unless you think everyone is a last minute shopper. Plus, that's not a phenomenon that is ever seen in the stock market. 
I'm glad we're back from the drop but don't kid yourself - last week we saw what a loss of confidence looks like, not see perfectly normal Christmas shopping
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:16:21
We should pool our $ and buy the whole thing up 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:01
Lol we broke every support. Is that good or bad? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:10:36
What's the difference? You seem to be implying the cme will be settled in BTC? I couldn't find any info online
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:01:20
They market gdax as the professional version of coinbase...for whatever that's worth...
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:13:16
Yeah...unless Zuck Just buys more BTC than the twins, then they'll be screwed again 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:33:56
Hopefully you're right. I have never seen anything like this. Do you have a lot of trading experience beyond crypto? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:27:23
You might be right. I've only been in it a few months, but have years of experience w stocks...just looks like BTC is picking up velocity to the downside and you know what they say about falling knives...but maybe in crypto land its not a big deal 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:17:07
I dont think theres any correlation 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:11
Gdax is frozen, that price isn't liquid and therefore basically worthless.  
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:15:02
Is it a risk that they all disappear in the long run?
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:57:01
Do you mean support or resistance?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:43:13
allegedly through gdax but I haven't tried it 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:22
Lol oh the irony 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:14:28
In fairness, most people buy assets hoping they appreciate, not to support because their mentality aligns with some ideology of what the technology could do. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:11:19
Meh I doubt bankers are shorting BTC. Shorting BTC is much harder to do than shorting, say Tesla. Moreover, check out the Feb, Mar, and June futures - all over 20k. 
This is called volatility. Not some nefarious bank plot. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:17:10
If I were you'd I'd literally just let it sit and not even check on it more than once a week. You don't have time to learn trading right now, IMO, as focusing on education will likely be much more beneficial for you in the long run - not that I'm trying to tell you what to do or anything.
Also, you have time on your side. You'll thank yourself later if you wake up in your mid 20s one day and the cryptos blew up.
And finally, not to belittle the amount or anything, but you'll really ramp up your income in the next 5-8 years. So say you put in $500 now and you don't have a job because you're in high school...but say you get a summer job at $15/hour...That means in one week (40 hours) you can recover the $500 you put in (more, actually). 
So basically just let it ride and enjoy your life, there is literally nothing you need to do with this right now other than not losing the password/keys
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:07:55
The price varies a bit depending on what your source is. GDAX is pretty popular around here 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:01:11
Its a pretty serious gut check isnt it 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:52:27
Price looks pretty vulnerable here, hopefully there's a strong bounce back although I doubt it happens today 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:48:40
Why dont you just sell it now? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:38:35
Cool, thanks, Do you think theres a lot of short interest out there? Can it be measured as with stocks?
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:55:39
I mean, to be fair...it takes something like $25k margin requirement to even begin playing on the futures market. Most people with that type of money aren't as dumb as one might think 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:48:23
TBH, as much as I enjoy indulging in the whale speculation on this sub, the real problem at the moment is that we have less buyers than sellers. It's not really a grand conspiracy or anything 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:44:02
I wish an apartment (condo actually) could be bought for 3 btc in my city. Im looking at 30btc min to get in the game 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:53:40
Would be nice, but I doubt that represents a large number of people or BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:34:39
I think the premise of your post is wrong. Cost basis is 0, not initial trading value. There's no tax advantage
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:45:21
I think a lot of BTC holders are getting access to their forked off bch for the first time today and probably wanna flip it immediately 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:57:49
Im always open to learning more. However, my understanding is that you said (perhaps implicitly) that Gold's 8trillion market cap is nothing, and that derivatives are 1.2quadrillion. I think you were saying that to suggest that BTC market cap is more comparable to that of derivatives than of gold. 
Thus, I am asking why you think that. I understand derivates plenty well. Just like you said, BTC is a commodity, not a derivative, so why did you refer to their 1.2Q market cap?
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:48:43
I'm saying that just because electricity is cheap doesn't mean there aren't poor people who may need it for everyday life. In other words, who is to say it's overproduction, as opposed to bring priced low because it's consumers are poor. So as BTC "arbitrates" the energy costs, is it also pricing people out of electricity they need? 
It may not be, but the point is unacknowledged. 
Also, what happens if there isn't "cheap" electricity available any more? 
Not saying the argument is totally without merit...it's pretty clever, like I said,.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:12
How would you short? I did a little research on this and didn't find any/many places that would lend coins to short. I actually think that there's very little true shorting of BTC going on, which makes this dip all the more amazing 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:07:42
Nothing. But I think this line of the thread is asking about what happens once there are competing needs for electricity - will the BTC miners return the electricity once its needed for somrthing else?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:48:21
That's why they say only invest what you can afford to lose. I think the trick is that you should focus on other parts of your financial life - i.e. review your budget, build some savings, etc., and just kinda forget about the crypto investment for like 6 months. Easier said than done :D 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:12
Eastern or central? I think we're about to see a massive drop like we havent even seen yet 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:39:23

Show them the wild swings, thats all they need to know :D
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:35:28
Nope. But I think part of the delay comes from coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:42:11
This won't move the needle much. Wait til some of the first contracts expire, I'll bet it gets wild then 
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:33:35
I'd expect a lot of action around those days. Could be downside action too though 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:25:16
this is untrue. My understanding is the IRS is comsidering "spending as a currency" to be a taxable event
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:43:55
Yup, I thought I saw a 280 or 290k number in there somewhere. What do you think is causing the reduction? Randomness? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:00:28
I doubt this is a conspiracy. They are probably in over their heads on a technical level 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:03:21
RemindMe! 11 days
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:38:22

OP - hows the hodling going? We want some updates 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:36:49
Awesome, you rock, thanks. I should probably learn to use a wallet anyways in the near future 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:31:35
Sorry, I know, I was on mobile. 
BTC - Pros: I like the store-of-value use case; I like the "legitimacy" of futures and probably upcoming ETFs, I think the first mover advantage is helpful. Cons: Obviously tx time and cost. 
ETH - Pros: Tech seems to have the best combo of use cases and adaption; community seems stable; and I think the cryptokitties are actually good publicity, rather than a nuance 
XRP - Pros: Again, cool technology, cool use cases; likely  to get more use cases in the future; good marketing. Cons: Not sure how Ripple as a technology affects xrp as a currency. I see a very real possibility that the tech company succeeds without the coin rising in value, in which case I've wasted my time and money. This sorta applies to ETH too, to a lesser degree.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:50:53
Pretty much agree spot on, though I don't like it one bit 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:09:28
Futures trading in isolation doesn't affect the price of the underlying. But it often brings a lot of volume to the underlying too, they kind of go hand in hand. So it's the indirect effects that are being discussed in this thread
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:29:34
True, but what do you think B2X value will be? If it's the same as BTC, then obviously you'd be able to double your $ in one day. I doubt that's the case though...more likely BTC will drop a little and b2x will drop a lot, and we'll come out roughly the same as we are now 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:20:31
I get that. My quibble is this idea that a futures contract can "short" BTC, but the responses in this thread are making clear that what people actually mean is that traders will take short positions to combine w their futures positions. I like precise statements :)
That being said, I would like to learn more about shorting BTC because my current understanding is that its not as easy to do as shorting, say, MSFT. It seems there is little available to short and the rate is high. Do you have any insight? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:01:27
I hodled all my btc, so I'm feeling a bit better now ... the bleeding seems to have stopped, which is half the battled. I got weak and dumped my gbtc, which turned out to be a mistake, but whatever I guess! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:12:12
Maybe buy a small amount? The crash isn't done though and worse, I don't think the bubble is coming back 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:22:11
Yes you can. If you want you could just get out of BTC and trade futures exclusively. Trading futures requires margin though, in other words you gotta have some relatively serious $ in your brokerage account and they'll be watching to make sure you always have enough cash in case your trade goes bad. You can trade futures on TD Ameritrade but you gotta get your account qualified. 
I have no idea how experienced you are or how much cash you have, but generally speaking, this isn't something that people with small $ and no experience should be doing.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:17:09

@_date: 2017-12-18 01:17:35
I didnt downvote you, but most likely others are because this has nothing to do with "the banks." It shouldnt come as a surprise that something which rips up 300% since thanksgiving can also rip down pretty quickly. Its called symetry 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:16:47
I thought that was hilarious. Doubt it impacts BTC directly, but its always a good sign when the mania reaches the point where frauds are being busted 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:24:58
This is obviously more of a gamble than some sort of well-considered financial planning. But you can't say it lacks excitement
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:54:07
No. With stocks and mutualmfunds, you dont incurr a tax until you actually sell. So if you hold for ten years and its skyrocketing, you might not be on the hook for anything until you sell in the tenth year. 
What you are thinking of (e.g. taxed depending on how much the overall portfolio went up or down) is called mark-to-market accounting and is sort of sophisitcated and does not apply to individuals.

Fingers crossed bud! The bleeding definitely stopped. Still not convinced there's real big bids here, but hoping for it. Kicking myself for not trading the crash better. But Like I said, my BTC is ��% Hodl so my bottom line is basically just sitting back and hoping for the best!

Great answer, I can respect that. Nonetheless, I am not sure that there is enough Bitcoin available to short on an institutional scale. I have been searching google about this for a while now and cant find a brokerage that would let me short btc. Do you have any experience/knowledge w shorting BTC? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:47:54
Yeah, I actually decided early on to hold through this even though I knew it'd be ugly. I'm ok with that. My bigger problem at the moment is that I had a couple of shares of GBTC which were riding real high and are now crashing hard. I know I should have avoided that ETF haha

Do I get bch even if I didn't own BTC until after the fork?

Crashed through support at 12k. New target is 8.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:02:22
Possibly. I don't know. But the pound is a currency and BTC is not. BTC is capital asset. You better do your own research though since I'm not a tax pro 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:00:30
If youre looking for a good day-trade, that one is worth making. Situation is changing so quickly...I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if BTC drops once BCH is unfrozen but the uncertainty/volatility is what your reward will be based on if you are right 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:19:47
Here comes the plunge. -1000 in about 3 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:16:19
I keep hearing that, but I don't understand why people say this. How does buying or selling a future "short" the underlying? It doesn't. If you disagree, I'd love to hear an explanation. I have a background in options, so admittedly my futures experience is very limited. I could be wrong, but I don't think so. 
 The mechanics of shorting BTC are actually quite impractical. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:26:21
But, was it really enough???
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:12:14
will you cover my $233? Ill pay it back once we hit 20k
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:40:30
I like Ripple's business model but I just dont really understand why their coin should increase in value. It's not viewed as a "store of value" the way BTC is. Basically its like 3-D chess: 1) Replace Swift 2) ??? 3) XRP to the moon! 
In any event, I got a little bit of it and thinking of buying more but only because I'm hoping a greater fool will pay more for it later 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:14:36
I think "trading" BTC has been a great educational experience for a lot of people with little experience of how markets work. Even the "regulated" markets have people who are spoofing, high frequency trading, etc...If theres a chance to make money in a market, rest assured that all sorts of strategies - legal, illegal, and somewhere in the middle - will find their way into the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:00:28

I don't know. I try to block out everything other than the facts, whether it be good or bad. With respect to the article you posted though, its not really FUD. Sounds like scammers were trying to manipulate their little stock...that's fraud, not FUD, and it happens in every mania...
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:10:18
I'm on the fence. On one hand, the selling pressure has been intense and I could see another down leg. On the other hand, crpyto changes so quickly that it's totally possible we get a big run in the next two weeks. It would really help to have some positive news, e.g. lightning network comes online, to drive the price 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:37:32
I have a feeling we're gonna see some volatility here in the next six hours...could be a crash down to 12 or a rip to 19...will be exciting for sure 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:01:40
I'm kinda getting the feeling there's a big drop coming in the next day or so. But might be back to 20k by NYE, its BTC which moves so fast and unpredictable...

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:15:20
Yup 12k easily. It seems the first wave of selling has ended but there is no confidence for buyers to come back. That's all BTC really ever was, a "store of value" that "stored value" because other people would pay more for it in the future. Without people lining up to pay more for it, the price will get ugly here I think 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:04:41
The word you're looking for is "support."

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:44
My totally uninformed opinion is selling BCH to buy BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:11:00
To be fair, it's bch that existed all along but can be accessed by coinbase accounts for the first time today
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:10:08
Anyone think we'll get a good run today or tomorrow? Maybe 19-20k?

@_date: 2017-12-24 00:29:04
Ah good explanation. But he's also ripping on coinbase, it seems. So why would this necessarily be a positive endorsement of BTC, rather than just, say, a new exchange opening or something like that?

@_date: 2017-12-21 05:28:39
I must be totally stupid bc I didnt know about this. Currently on an exchange,  how much do you think Id get by moving to a hw wallet?

tell us how much more cash you have on the sidelines 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:09:58
Why wouldnt people just convert to USD and trade through that? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:30:22
Youre not really wrong. Many coins such as XRP are basically used just to facilitate the product. Your phrase "priviledged access" is actually really on point. The hope basically is that people will pay more for that access in the future than today. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:16

@_date: 2017-12-18 23:00:05
Pretty sure, but I haven't researched it in detail. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:42:42
Yes, keep buying low and selling high, its a pretty good way to get rich 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:40:07
Sometimes you hold combinations of the commodity and the derivative to create hedges or risk profiles that suit your desire/tolerance
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:11:01
Since you seem knowledgeable re: b2x fork...if I keep mine on coinbase, will they credit me the b2x? Or do I need to move to a hardware wallet to and claim it myself? 
Also, what's the deal w replay protection? Previously I read that I can only use one of the two coins, while the unused one will disappear
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:08:10
Everyone's style and risk tolerance is different. From what you're describing, it doesn't sound like active trading is necessarily the best for you at this time. But regardless of what you want, I think the first important step is that you only bought an amount which you don't REALLY care about. 
If the amount is causing you anxiety, my first suggestion is don't panic...we could easily see 17k next week. But if its absolutely unbearable, trim your position by rounding down a little. E.g. if you bought like $1,400, trim to $1k. If you bought 15k, trim down to 10k. Whatever.
Second, this is just a thought, but consider buying some SPY (if you haven't already) so that your investments include some U.S. equities, which are not perfect but also not nearly as volatile. 
Thirs, if you really want to get into trading, take an amount that is really small, or even make a paper account (is that a thing for BTC)? Take like $500 and just start day trading, but understand that you need to keep fees low becasue they'll kill you. Expect to learn a hard lesson (e.g. lose money) but at least then you'll have your taste of trading and be able to decide if its for you.
In short, yout BTC LTC ETH strategy is perfectly fine though. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:53:45
I hope so. Looks like we're running out of buyers for the moment though. This 19k has been a tough nut to crack the last few days 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:20
At least BTC is catching bids over the past hour. Hopefully that continues overnight

Good question. I tend to think eth is the never one due for a good run, so I'll pick eth at 2k. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:13:59
My speculation is that there aren't enough buyers, and there's a loss of confidence. BTC is largely a confidence game, and right now there isn't any big money looking to get into the game
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:24:41
It shows you how many buy (green) and sell (red) orders there are at any given price. So right now you might see a ton of people willing to buy around 18100 or 18200, while there is a fairly steady stream of sellers aroind 18500-18700. So basically supply and demand work themselves out through a matching engine, and the price is bouncing somewhere in the middle 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:29:12
I agree with you in concept, but I can't help but wonder how much this damages confidence in BTC ... which at this point, is really the only thing that matters. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:23:25
Yup! BTC is like "last night I took an L but today I bounce back!!!" 
How long you think this will run?

I guess I'm in need of some education, then. "Shorting" a futures contract does not short the underlying. Are you saying I'm wrong? (I'm wrong all the time in life, so no offense taken) 
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:42:04

@_date: 2017-11-14 19:39:45
I'm not familiar with the Chinese example you provided, but if one trades at a discount to the other, why isn't that discount eliminated by arbitrage? That's a normal consequence in virtually all markets. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:38:19
Yeah, the fallacy of the pizza is that literally every one of us could have bought BTC that day. We all missed the same opportunity

Then you just need to own more bitcoins, duh
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:54:43
Haha in that case, what would be a version that does pay enough? I'm in the market for something along those lines...
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:49:41
Great questions, you are on the right path. 
Imagine a grocery store and a farmer want to get some certainty and predictability about next year's costs and revenues. The store may give the farmer $500 today in exchange for the right to buy one bushel of corn at 7,500 next summer. 
Fast forward to next summer. Say the price of corn has gone to 10,000. The store comes out ahead because the farmer is obligated to deliver the corn at 7,500, which is cheaper than the market rate of 10,000. So the store "saves," e.g. "wins" $2,500 because they are getting corn cheaper than market value (technically only $2,000 since the store paid $500 up front). In this scenario, the farmer has missed out on $2,500 in profit.
Conversely, imagine corn drops to $5,000. The store still has to pay $7,500 so now the farmer comes out $2,500 ahead (plus the $500 up front) because he gets to sell the corn at above market value. Conversely, the store "loses" since they have to buy corn at 7,500, when it's value is only $5,000. Has the store just waited to buy corn next summer, they could have saved $2,500. 
These contracts are intended to give parties certainty. If you are a farmer with a family to feed, you may not want to wait and find out the hard way of corn will be worth 10,000, 5,000, or 0 next summer. 
As a practical matter, what I suspect people will do with regard to BTC futures, is use them as a way to gamble that the price of BTC will skyrocket. E.g there will be people who say "I will give you $500 today in exchange for the right to buy BTC from you at 7,500 next year." The hope, of course, is that Bitcoin goes to 25,000, in which case the owner of that contract will have a great day buying BTC at 7,500 and instantly flipping it on an exchange for 25,000 or whatever. 
It's worth noting that there are a few requirements before any brokerage will let you buy futures. You need to have certain amount of cash, because, as you can see from the example above, it would be very problematic if you promised to buy BTC at 10,000 next summer and it drops to 5,000, and you don't have the cash to cover the lose. 
Banks and brokerages that let you trade futures will be watching very closely to make sure traders have the cash to back up their bets 
Edit: I messed up the part about paying $500 up front. There is no such payment. My background is in options and my familiarity with futures is second hand, so please forgive me. But heres a good link explaining:
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:58:25
Got it. Is that basically on par w a hardware wallet such as ledger?  Also, if you store on hardware, how do you handle forks? 
I'm learning pretty quick from this sub. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:51:12
Just curious - how does futures help short BTC? The answer is, it doesnt. Shorting BTC is possible but not easy, and not really doable on an institutional scale at the moment, to my understanding. 
Also, cme futures will NOT make it easier for people to buy BTC. Getting your account cleared for futures trading is much harder than getting a coinbase account.

I agree with what you're saying, but wouldn't call it "linkage." It's a natural consequence of a (relatively) efficient and rational marketplace. 
But based on some of the posts I'm reading here, people seem to think that there is some mandatory link, or worse, that the CME is somehow promising something to BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:56:36
Which, if we are being honest, we laready know the rules dont stop them
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:33:05
I don't think "their good word" links the future to BTC. There is no link, real or perceived. The only link is that the value of a futures contract goes up if BTC goes up, and the value goes down if BTC goes down. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:32:54
Yup, that's one way to create a hedged position 
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:18:17
Close, but that's one area where futures and options differ. If you buy the future, you are in a binding contract - it's no longer the "right" to buy, but rather mandatory to buy. So in a futures contract, if the price moves against you, you still have to complete the transaction. 
With an options contract,  if the price moves against you, you just don't have to go through with the transaction - i.e. it is "optional."
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:58:13
Yup thats exactly the name of the game. Only thing thats different here is that I dont think shorting BTC is particularly practical. 
But, theyll just sell large positions to go neutral and pick up $ on the short futures
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:55:31
RSI is a technical trading indicator. Hes saying the RSI is indicating "overbought" which shoild not come as a surprise given the run up. Hes further suggesting that the RSI, viewed on 1 week increments, looks like itll bounce in another one or two weeks. 
Id like to see the chart hes looking at since I cant find one 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:31:33
Buying or selling a futures contract does not involve any BTC transaction. It's like betting on a football game - you can bet that the Patriots will beat the Falcons, but your bet does not in any way influence the actual game.
That said, many traders like to pair the futures contract with some ownership of the underlying asset. That means that some people who want to play in the futures market will also buy BTC in order to hedge their positions. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:02:08
As best I can tell, its really hard to short BTC at the moment since few places will (safely and reliably) lend the BTC to sell short. This creates an upward bias IMO
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:05:40
Haha yeah, I guess I count a "buy and hodl" as a trade, even though I guess that's a loose use of the term 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:57:35
What's your job? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:50:35
Haha your warning is noted 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:30:01
At its core, a futures contract is really nothing more or less than a gamble on Bitcoin prices. A pretty decent analogy is sports betting, where you are given a point spread and then pick which side you want. 
In the futures market, you are basically saying "I think the price of Bitcoin will exceed XXXX (e.g. $8,000) on a certain date in the future (e.g. March, 2018)." If the price of Bitcoin in fact exceeds $8k on March, 2018, then you will "win" cash. If the price is lower, you lost cash.
It can get a bit more complicated than that - e.g. if the price goes to $8,001 then the amount you "win" would be $1 and that might not be enough to cover your premium and/or transaction costs, so you might still be a "loser."
The origin of futures contracts is largely in commodities, where farmers and/or miners wanted to place bets on the price in the future as a hedge against a potentially bad harvest season. E.g. a farmer might try to make a "negative" bet on the price of corn, that way he will "win the bet" if his corn harvest sucks (e.g. due to weather) and at least he will have some money to make up for the shitty harvest. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:14:11
Yeah. Options and futures can both be used as a hedge especially in scenarios where your position includes more than just one contract. If your objective is truly hedging (and not just speculating, which I suspect is what BTC futures will be used for) then you can buy and sell a number of different contracts, and/or also own the underlying asset. Depending on what you combine, you can achieve different risk profiles
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:02:51
Pretty good post, but there is one aspect I think you could elaborate on more. While I agree that cryptos (and likely, Bitcoin) are here to stay, and that their limited nature makes them uniquely suited to store value, I found your post a bit short on WHAT that value should be. 
For example, if BTC does not continue to be adapted,  then its only purpose will be speculative. What I mean is that, if stores dont accept BTC, and transaction fees are high, then people will use BTC only to speculate and not to transact. That will create a danger to BTCs value. 
Also, your post is a bit short on competition. If BTCs value gets TOO high, what is to stop people from buying competing altcoins? As with most things, there is supply and demand, and when demand outweighs supply then competitors come online. 
Nonetheless, a good contribution to the conversation.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:08:35

Who is spreading that propaganda? I guess I haven't consumed enough propaganda. All I see is the retail "investors" who came into the market in Nov. getting back out now

3x profit = "decent"???
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:36:29
Damn, looks like you're missing the best dip of all then?

Wow! BTC forum just keeps giving. Ive been wondering about this for a long time: Ill be in the bathroom at work and some old dude will come in, shit, not wipe, and leave, faster than I can take a leak. Now I know, those guys metamucil!!!
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:34:26
Shhh get out of here with your logic. What are you, some kind of bank shill?
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:55:32
Well hopefully you've been following instructions

Eh, TBH it wouldn't be that hard to sell 10k of BTC. It's seen 5-10k in daily volume throughout Jan. You'd just have to be a little clever about not selling it all at once. Would be a fun problem to have :) 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:16:03
Well no matter how bad BTC has been, at least I don't own any xiv :DDD
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:00:48
Probably need to divide market cap by $-weighted daily volume, which would tell you how many days it would take to cycle through each coin in existence. Seems like a pretty reasonable metric, esp since its not hard to put together 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:13:34
So this is good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:41:09
I eat ton of veggies and I still wipe.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:51:54
You'd be surprised how stupid people can be
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:26:46
Hopefully the SEC starts buying soon 
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:29:34
We might have, but it will take 10-14 days to confirm IMO. At the moment BTC is still seeing lower lows and lower highs, and it's been tanking about one day out of every 7. I'd want to see the 10k level sustained before feeling "comfortable" about a bottom 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:12:45
You know the best way to fight such an attack? If everyone woild keep buying!
