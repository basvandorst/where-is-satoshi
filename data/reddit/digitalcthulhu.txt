Good but wallets tips for comparison (popup windows) dissapeared. It was usefull.

i had the same problem with poloniex but i have made 3 attempts - uploaded documents and after couple of weeks my account is unlocked.

Seems like it's just a fake. Website polit.com.ua is a dirty place with SEO articles and links. No news in other media which I read every day ( AIN.ua , Liga.net ). Some comments and original post is from fresh reddit accounts.

That's the way Google works. No images for me at all. It's OK.
@_date: 2017-09-23 10:01:40
I think Luke means someone have to make BIP on github first.
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:23:37
Bitcoin users are community. 
Github is place for open-source software: 
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:39:07
[xvideos.com]( is not enough?
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:52:25
have you found solution? 
the same problem here.
node worked fine but now unreachable.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:48:27
They want to stop **UASF**.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:14:47
i support UASF.
i think it's very important some exchanges to support BIP148 too. maybe they need developers help or manual how to upgrade their software to be ready for BIP148?
@_date: 2017-05-03 13:08:55
Thank you! Will try )
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:35:11
 - broken link
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:32:49
they just trying to stop UASF at August 1.
@_date: 2017-05-28 06:24:49
Is there a text version? My english is not fluent :)
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:30:19
Look at Ethereum: seems like having one tech leader is good for development while network is decentralized. If UASF fails i will use ethereum.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:29:29
They just trying to cancel UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:39:12
In my case it was router issue.
@_date: 2017-05-03 19:22:09
Want to tell about preliminary results. 
Found out that Schildbach Bitcoin Wallet is freezing after i press "Request" button and "skip regular peer discovery" is checked ("on") and "trusted peer" defined (in Settings). It's on Motorola Droid Turbo (Android). 
Later will try Greenbits.

i'm not sure, but are there any bitfury miners? 
 
@_date: 2017-07-06 17:34:07
i've downoaded here: bitcoinuasf.org
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:54:10
So maybe do something )
@_date: 2017-07-03 10:07:06
@_date: 2017-07-03 21:52:59
But I don't need pony )
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:59:02
@_date: 2017-07-03 21:46:09
Is it related in some way with segwit deployment via BIP148? More info here: [BIP148 wiki](
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:27:46
Thank you for this link!
@_date: 2017-07-02 13:35:48
Yes, my node is one of my wallets.
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:42:35
Seems like you hate Pony. Eric Cartman, is it you?
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:16:36
Can't find binary download. Where is it?
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:53:43
Here: bitcoinuasf.org . It uses the same chain data if you had bitcoin core before on the same computer. So even no need to sync data again.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:21:15
fresh news: [bitfury the first miner to signal with nya](
I'm not sure it's good for bitcoin because segwit2x is not well-tested. It can be disaster for bitcoin. I trust Core Developers only.
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:39:17
Don't keep bitcoins on Poloniex anyway. Use software, hardware or paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:44:29
hope it's temporarily )
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:06:14
They support Segwit2Mb proposal: 
[Supporters as of May 25]( 
So not sure if they change their mind.
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:00:53


Maybe he means "hardware GUI wallet" ?
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:56:58
I hope BitFury will support UASF in last minute.
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:58:55
but why not here: 
[github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases]( )  ?
