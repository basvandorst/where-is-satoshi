I 100% agree. I'm genuinely curious about something though because there is still 1 concern that I have about Bitcoin that I'm trying to figure out if it'll be a real issue. Do you think the fact that there are wallets that literally have half a percentage of all of the Bitcoin could lead to the same powerful elite forming that we have today?

This answer is underrated. Financial innovation is cool and all. But to say that you are spending Bitcoin at a Starbucks would be about as accurate as  saying that I personally lead the rebel alliance to defeat the empire in star wars. No I merely watched someone act it out on TV.

In essence, everything in life is a gamble of some kind. A job is low risk, low reward and investing in Bitcoin is higher risk, higher reward. Life is about choosing your gambles, enjoying the moments of reward, and living with the moments of loss

I would agree a little bit I think it all depends on how easy we can make it for the laymen. For example, almost anyone can change a light bulb by themselves and therefore they usually do. But tell the average person to repair the electrical damage done behind the walls of their house and they'd laugh at you. Not because they don't want to know how but because they probably don't have the time to learn. Yes we could all grow our own food and rebuild our houses when they break down but I don't really blame people who choose to spend their time and energy on other things. But if managing your money in a trustless way is as easy as changing a light bulb, then yeah I would have no sympathy for someone who still chooses to let centralized authority manage their money for them anyways

Ya I understand the backing up of the key. But your options are 1) keep the hw wallet and paper backup in your house and risk burglary of one of them or a fire destroying both of them or 2) take one out of the house with you and risk it getting stolen. (Am I sounding paranoid yet? lol) This is why I like the idea of multisig.

It's a little apples to oranges but I think I'd still disagree. 1971 was actually when the first email was sent. Meaning this video was showing what 13 years of email development got us! Windows 95 was when internet technology really became dumbed down enough for the average consumer to feel comfortable in their household for non business reasons. That's 24 years later! Now we are 10 years into crypto tech. While key management is still not easy for the average Joe, any consumer can at the very least open a Coinbase account. But even better, anyone can download a custodial lightning app like Blue Wallet and can send and receive Bitcoin in a matter of seconds. So ya, I'd say that while we have a long way to go, we're moving right along at a good speed

Not sure why you got downvoted. I'm a Bitcoin fan as much as the next guy but I can still admit the truth in your statement. We saw how high fees got in 2017. Can you imagine if everyone in China started using Bitcoin for their daily purchases? Lightning is great too, but until we can make sure all the bugs are worked out, we shouldn't expect people to bet their paychecks on it (unless they choose to out of their own interest in the technology of course). The arrogance I see around Bitcoin is interesting at times. We want everyone to use it but we don't want to admit that it has a long ways to go before everyone CAN use it. And I'm not saying that we need to be Bitcoin SV or anything, I'm just saying that $1000 transaction fees and a 100TB blockchain is our future if we aren't careful.

Even though I'm a software engineer for work, everything else computer related for hobby, I didn't feel like putting in the effort into crypto. Then one day someone sent me 100 Satoshi over lightning and I was amazed. I started showing lightning off to my friends and family and they all thought it was cool too. I decided that I needed a little more to fund my demos so I learned how to buy a little on Coinbase and move it into lightning. Eventually I was storing Bitcoin in my own wallet and eventually Ethereum in a web wallet. I started trading tokens on DEX's, playing web3 games etc. I continued to invest more and more, learn about all kinds of different new technologies. It also pushed me to study economics and learn how the American financial and banking system works. This all happened over the course of a year. A lot of the things I've learned, I've been able to explain to non technical people and they get it immediately. Some people around me invested into crypto themselves not because they know how the blockchain works, but because they come to realize how simple it is from a user standpoint. This is why I'm thankful that easier to use technologies continue to come out to help people get introduced to the world of crypto. For those people around me, a 30 second lightning demo is all it takes for them to be convinced just like it was for me a year ago.

I'm educating people on all aspects of crypto. If the investment route is what it takes for some people to get exposure then so be it. The point isn't to tell people what they're allowed to do with crypto. The point is to just get them doing *something* with it for now. Besides, didn't you read the part of my comment where I said that the thing I do to convince them that crypto is worth something is that I demo LN for them first?

@_date: 2019-10-02 14:31:49
Well I don't think it'd be very effective for me to tell people "hey you need to stop buying things with USD today and start using Bitcoin". People purchase with Bitcoin when merchants all start excepting it in the easiest possible way. Merchants accept Bitcoin when everyone is holding Bitcoin, otherwise there would be no point in accepting it. Everyone holds Bitcoin when they feel like they have some reason to (like maybe they think it'll hedge them from the issues with centralized banking economies). But even before that, it all starts with exposure and education. The rest will happen on its own

And then there's people who spent $1000 on Bitcoin in 2013...
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:27:55
The thing I've learned about people is they don't want to be told what to spend their money on. The most success I've had with people is just educating them when they're interested in learning. But that means I have to first educate myself. I study the tech, the latest conveniences, and so on. I also study the current state of the USD and everything that goes into it's success or failure. I help people understand those ideas and sometimes it has led to people deciding themselves without any coersion on my part that they want to get some Bitcoin for themselves. I also think it's a good sign that people want Bitcoin only when they understand it.

No you're right. I totally understand how the arrogance in my country must look like to the rest of the world. It took me visiting other countries to snap out of it and see how limited and self centered our perspective is. And you're right, I should probably be more careful about saying things like American. I just wish we had a cooler name than US citizen...
One more thought, isn't it also self centered to act like we're the only country with states?

I learned my lesson with centralized exchanges when Poloniex screwed me over. I wish DEXs were higher volume because it's so nice to not have to trust the exchange. IDEX has been great for me lately but once again, doesn't have the same volume as Kraken and Poloniex.

Not long ago I bought some crypto and put it into Poloniex so that I could learn about investing and trading. Not long afterwards they, without warning said that if you want to withdraw a single cent of your own money, you have to give them your SSN and a picture of your passport. Since I'm not going to give that kind of info to an exchange that already had a history of being hacked, has a BBB rating of an F, and now is using a hostage technique to get people to abandon their own money I walked away and gave up on crypto for a while. It was only recently that I got back into trading with a DEX that I learned that it can be something for the average Joe to get into. Moral of the story is, crypto is trustless for a reason and the moment you combine it with a system where you have to trust people, you will get screwed over in the end. As long as it stays trustless, then yes, anyone can learn about investing and trading with crypto

People try to tell me about football daily even though I look at them with a blank stare that obviously says "I have no idea what your talking about and I don't care" and I shrug it off and move on. Then I find something in a conversation that relates to Bitcoin and I share a thought about it and they respond like you. Moral of the story, if you love talking about men running into each other repeatedly then you're doing everyone a favor but if you like talking about the current transformation of the monetary system of the world, then you're just polluting the air with your voice and wasting everyone's time. Sounds fair.

There's a different between being Bitcoin-friendly and being Bitcoin-aware. Keep in mind that this happened not long after Libra was announced. It seems to me like the companies that have been long established in the financial sector are all looking for a "corporate" solution, not decentralized. Just look at JPMorganCoin. But you need people to understand the original blockchain technologies if your going to get them to understand the corporate ones.
That being said, remember that Visa is merely a tool and banks do the actual lending. So it's up to the banks to do it first. And not just any random bank in the world, but ones that Visa can trust are meeting government rules and regulations. The closest thing we have to that are banks that let you deposit crypto and then lend you cash having the crypto be used as collateral as a replacement to the credit score system. And there are already Visa cards that exist for those banks. You'll have to give it time to see where it all ends up
@_date: 2019-09-21 06:04:07
I'm curious why you think that is. It feels like we're on a roll to keep doubling qubits every year or so. 15 years sounds like too big of an estimate unless development slows down.
@_date: 2019-09-18 23:13:07
Here's my understanding of what actually happened (at least someone else explained this to me). Nobody gets paid that money. The federal reserve can reduce interest rates on overnight lending by purchasing one-day treasury bonds. So after a day, the money goes right back to the reserve. So since there was a strange spike in overnight lending interest rates (nobody really knows why it happened), the Fed was able to counteract that by pumping a ton of money into those one day bonds. After 24 hours, everything goes back to normal (theoretically). The scary part is that the last time a spike in overnight interest rates happened was I'm 2008. It's a scary market indicator just like the inversion of the yield curve and so on.
