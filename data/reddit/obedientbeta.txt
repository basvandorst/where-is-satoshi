It was the same before Bitcoin, the  internet, and your smart phone. How old are the people posting in this thread? Mid 20s? Well let me give you a trinket: This is life. You might have gotten lucky with a trade, but most of the world lives on a dollar or two a day. Most of the world has to haggle, harangue, and hack for a few bits. Most of the world toils everyday just to scrape by. What, did you think the word "grind" came from a video game?  Existence is suffering, money is power, what else haven't you kids learned yet? Ok ok I will get off my soapbox and apologies for sounding condescending, that's what happens when you get old and everyone around you sounds as naive as a bright-eyed bushy-tailed squirrel. Now you kids get off my lawn.

It's only $1800 to mine in China, where most of the mining goes on.

Just asking for a basic valuation model for Bitcoin. If you own it wouldn't you want to have a model that explains it's valuation? 
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:29:07
Down. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:16:56
It will go to the bottom, maybe not zero, but close to worthless. Maybe I'm just upset and speaking from emotion, but the air is coming out of the balloon. Does anyone have a fundamental valuation model for Bitcoin? Not just theories, one that's backed with numbers and clearly shows what the value of Bitcoin should be? Thanks.

When it doesn't happen this year, and it won't, the meltdown will get worse.  Funny to hear all the talk of a loan bubble and fiat bubble while the biggest bubble in history is slowly popping.

I'm familiar with how Bitcoin works, The limited supply of coins, the growing network, the process of mining and halfing, etc.  I believe the value of Bitcoin can be determined by the size of the network, I'm just not exactly sure to value the network. 
Precisely how is owning stock in a company bullshit?  Give me reasons not just some vague feeling you have. Are the price to earnings ratios too high for you?  At least with a stock I can say the company earns X, the multiple for this industry is Y and derive a price/share. What's bullshit about that?
 Please peddle your doomsday scenarios elsewhere, if Zombie day comes it's more likely than not that we have no electricity making Bitcoin worthless.

Which makes him even more duplicitous. Defending someone who is a scam artist just because you are "close friends" is ethically worse than just being a dope.

So I guess you will be twice as strong when Bitcoin gets halved from here?

Actually if you give me any stock traded on the NYSE I can find 10 amaylsts that cover that company, and they can give me valuation models for the stock price. That shouldn't be too hard to ask for Bitcoin. And it has nothing to do with manipulation, doesn't anyone understand what I'm asking?

No that's wrong about gold, it rises and falls depending things like inflafion, sentiment of the economy, etc.

I think it's interesting to Value Bitcoin on a future total market value. That could be one useful method. 
I disagree with you on its value relative to gold. Believe it or not, you can take gold to any pawn shop in the US and get a very fair price for it. As well, during any doomsday scenario, my gold is going to be worth my life, my Bitcoin encryption keys on some computer that has no electricity is going to be worthless. But at least that's a start, one possible way to Value Bitcoin. 
I guess the questions would be: what would be size, what are your assumptions regarding the size, and what discount rate is given to determine the value of each coin relative to the size of the market. 
Still doesn't solve my problem, but it's at least a potential model and a good framework to start with.

Rule  It's always about Price. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:07:37
If I were a big player I would sell every time it goes up and push the price down, and wait for low-volume buys to push the price up again and then sell, the way it's been reacting since December.
@_date: 2018-06-17 14:56:08
But the "general market" is everybody, valuing Bitcoin based in consensus sounds flimsy at best. I want to know how they determine it's value, there has to be a method of all this is just pure speculation. I don't believe it's pure spec, so there must be a way to value Bitcoin. 
I do understand it doesn't create cash flows like a traditional business. But the dollar and other fiat act the same in this manner. Say what you will about fiat, the US Dollar is backed by the US economy, the faith in its institutions, and government stability.  Bitcoin has it's network, which I believe has a value, but I'm not sure what that value is or how to measure it. Kind of important questions right?
@_date: 2018-06-17 05:24:51
So you just guess at a total end value for Bitcoin? What's the guess based on?  A hunch? A good feeling?

Interesting article about this in the WSJ as well. The difference between the worst quarters: losing $7,000 per coin is a lot more painful than losing $11 per coin. Another takeaway, the futures market allowed traders with big money to short and those positions dominated the quarter. Lastly, with tax season approaching, expect more of a selloff. If no news is good news, then how bad is bad news?
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:48:53
Yeah, I'm going to go down with the ship. I figure the money I spent is never coming back, lesson learned. A friend of mine who trades commodities gave me some sage advice: Pigs get slaughtered. Wish I had heard that before I "invested." Oink.

I thought those things were good for Bitcoin? Decentralized and not tied to fiat? Isn't it like gold, going up when the market melts down? I can definitely see 1-2k in the future.

Dear Bot,
Read what I read above.

Adoption rate should be a percentage of households not X million users, in order to get a more accurate view. If not, population growth will skew the results.

The thing is, Bitcoin is up almost 600% in a year. To.me that means it is still way over bought and has a ways to fall.
