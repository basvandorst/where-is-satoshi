When I thought of all the movie plots that Bitcoin invalidated... There was a thread a while ago that listed a few but the first thing that came to mind was Jackie Brown. 
I think my realisation also came when I sent my first Bitcoin payment. It was the same feeling I had when I sent my first email; that sense of 'so this is how things will work from now on'. 
I think fundamentally though, Bitcoin (in spite of its flaws) represents a paradigm shift: never before has humankind had the ability to transfer wealth over distance without the assistance and permission of a third party.

Bitcoin viewpoints trend towards the super libertarian, I agree, but I think that being able to understand the economic model of something like bitcoin gives you something to compare to your own country's currency before you try to learn about it, which I think helps put things in context a lot.

Well on one hand, they never explicitly said they banned it forever and were never going to allow crypto on the app store. It might be they just wanted to hold back until they could confirm that they wouldn't be liable for money laundering apps; and now it *appears* that they've done some research and are opening the floodgates. I hope. 
I always felt like we should be a little more patient with huge companies adopting crypto as it's a brand new technology and there's still a lot of grey area surrounding it.

What I'm wondering then is are you willing to pay an extra 5-10% on top of whatever you're buying just to use Bitcoin? Or are you somehow buying Bitcoin exactly on spot price somewhere? 
For most people not current involved in crypto there is actually an incentive not to use crypto if they're just buying a coffee. However services like piiko are only really available for crypto (AFAIK).

It's also important to remember these bars only show how many bitcoins are being converted into fiat and/or bitcoin, they don't show how many bitcoins are being spent or traded for services.
[This]( would be a good example of the levels of bitcoins being sent around and give you another way to look at the volume of bitcoins moving hands.

Tend to buy a little every month and use it for any internet related purchases.

Either way it's not by a lot though so I have no problem spending it; usually using Snapcard for amazon purchases.

"Bitcoin is to money what emails were to letters"
@_date: 2014-10-24 09:02:03
I think that another approach to this problem is not to think about what the killer app is for Bitcoin, but rather to think about what we already have on the Internet but is now 'monetizable' thanks to Bitcoin. 
To give an example, tech support websites. Before, people would submit problems and hope someone out there would help them, and for the most part this works because IT people seem to be very generous and helpful even in their spare time. But what happens if you can now offer Bitcoin bounties on your problem? Can't get your printer to work with your Linux computer? Put a $10 bounty on someone solving the problem. 
I could see an entire industry popping up around something like this; teenagers all over the world could spend their free time solving problems and earning spare cash. People in India could potentially earn a living wage by offering tech support without needing any overhead. 
There are obvious problems associated with this model (how would we know their problem had been fixed?) but I'm just making a generalised example. My main point though is that before Bitcoin, that tech website would have to implement some kind of PayPal payment system, and pay all kinds of associated fees with sending money. They'd probably have to trust the website itself to hold their cash for them and 'charge' their account with high amounts to begin with to save on fees. However post Bitcoin, the website doesn't even have to hold any of the cash; it could all potentially be done completely trust-less and for extremely low fees. 
EDIT: There, I've given someone a free business idea potentially worth millions... The eBay of tech support! You're welcome. I'd do it myself but I don't know how to code. To anyone reading this, if you do end up becoming a millionaire please at least either credit me with the idea or buy me a drink (using Bitcoin)

I can see some barriers to acceptance here; first is obviously that there's no real exchange yet other than Localbitcoins.com and looks to have low volume, second that the technological literacy rate is low. The upper and middle class all seem to posess smartphones though, so my opinion is that the only thing missing from the equation is that, like my waiter last night, people literally just haven't heard of it yet. 
Shoutout to :)
Here in Bogota though there are two independant bars along Septima, one of their main streets, that accept bitcoin, so I would say it's gradually gaining momentum. Once they see the difference it will make there will be demand, at least from the merchant side of things. Colombians are born entrepreneurs, and are industrious and business-savvy people; the possibilities of bitcoin will not escape them for long.  
As a side note, I've noticed that many of my friends and colleagues here even those that have office jobs all tend to have completely unrelated side businesses of one form or another. I'd wonder if they would be more flexible accepting bitcoin for one business and being able to support themselves with the other, rather than putting all their eggs in one basket, so to speak. 
Another thing I've noticed here is that on meetup.com several of the largest groups are all 'hacker' groups and bitcoin specific groups. This makes me feel quite positive that several areas are catching on and spreading awareness.

As someone who travels a lot, paying for services to help me when I'm abroad would be fantastic and bitcoin would be perfect for that. Piiko has been a game changer for me as I carry a little container filled with foreign SIM cards and love being able to charge any of them at will depending on where I am. 
Broadly though, I want to see services for things that I CAN'T use fiat for rather than being able to pay for things in Bitcoin that I already use with fiat.

I also think this will get much easier in the future as the Bitcoin economy grows too, but at the moment I think it's not all there, though you're right in many cases I think it would beat 15% from western union. 
I tried as a test sending some money to the states from the UK and found it didn't beat a standard bank order, mostly because of the difference between the buy value on localbitcoins vs the sell price on coinbase.

Nice enough news. 
I think college campuses and bitcoin are an interesting idea. The college sphere tends to be quite an insular one where different ideas like bitcoin are more readily accepted than in other spheres. Being able to readily buy and sell a listed commodity would have been fairly popular among a large crowd at my uni, back in the day. 
Either way, if bitcoin does prove to be worth it's salt and becomes a major platform for innovation in the future, then I think the next mark zuckerberg or woz just received his first bitcoins.

Not really sure this is a great idea; reminds me a little too much of the posts in where people would complain about churchgoers leaving fake dollar bills with bible verses on them as tips. 
Maybe the polite thing to do would be to ask the waiter/ress if they prefer bitcoin or dollars. Even then though I'd find it kind of cringe. Maybe just do this at restaurants that have openly stated they accept bitcoin up front.

Very true. It's also quite interesting that with bitcoin you don't need the website to integrate anything to have it work, someone can just build their own code and integrate it seamlessly. 
Think of how hard it would be to get tipping working using something like Paypal... What a nightmare it would be to integrate and pay for all their overhead, and now think of how trivial it is for Bitcoin.

Reading through his history of posts, you really get the sense that he was a man who took security and encryption seriously. He certainly knew enough to develop bitcoin. He saw far enough ahead that he bought the bitcoin.org website with an untraceable anonymous service... and yet, we're supposed to believe he used his real name on the website after all that? On one of his posts he told someone to check his PGP signature to verify it was from him. Using his own name, after all those precautions, would be careless on a level that can barely be fathomed, and it doesn't add up at all. 
This above anything else makes me very suspicious about the newsweek story, I don't care what the reporter is saying he said.

Personally; I think of the aforementioned killer apps; Microtransactions has the best potential for getting into the mainstream, that also gives people a real reason to buy any in the first place. 
Depending on it's implementation, there are already many niche markets where this could take hold (MMORPG communities like WoW and Minecraft are the first to come to mind) and be implemented quickly, if consumers can be persuaded to pay for digital content; a trend that I see increasing with younger generations.

I want to send money to someone in Hong Kong, but they don't want to keep the money in bitcoins and need cash/bank deposit. 
If I send them bitcoins, how can they cash them in or sell them relatively easily? They're willing to try it but just need some guidance. 
As a side note, they initially asked me to send western union and provided me with 4-5 separate pieces of information I needed to send them money. Incredible to me that this is apparently the best method for international payments.

I like my explanation not only because it's a true elevator pitch, but because it actually contains a lot of information. 
The follow up I give to this is usually "think about how you would send money to someone in New Zealand or China. It would be a nightmare in this current system, and it would cost you more or less money depending on how close they are and how common their currency is, and it would take at least a week depending on how much you paid for the service. With bitcoin, that exchange happens near instantaneously, whether it's a working day or not, and costs the same as sending money to your neighbor. This is just one of many revolutionary advantages bitcoin has over traditional banks and money, and this is just the start."

Inflation is just a financial tool, it can be really great if used correctly or really, really bad if used wrong... just look at Argentina. Either way, I think, from my limited experience, that its a good idea to at least have one avenue or haven of deflationary assets such as gold or, IMO, bitcoin, to offset these effects to some degree. 
The gold standard isn't the end all solution to all the problems in the financial world but an inflationary currency has it's share of problems too. 
Is there a subreddit where people talk about this stuff? I'd be fascinated to learn an discuss things like this more but I have no idea where to go or start.

You have a room filled with people all telling you that 2+2=4. Everyone is saying this out loud, over and over, and if one of those people says 2+2=5, then everyone starts shouting 2+2=4 at him until he shuts up. 
Those people start forming into cliques and little groups. Some of them give their groups names, but they're still all shouting 2+2=4. 
The problem is one of those groups of people is getting bigger, and if they occupy half of the room then they can shout louder than the other people, and if they start shouting 2+2=5 then the other people won't be able to shout 2+2=4 loud enough to cancel them out, and we'll have the wrong answer.

While I don't actually know how to do this, you can put your coins in one address, sign a transaction to another address you have the private key for, for 7 years from now and then burn or delete the original private key. 
That transaction will only be valid in 7 years, and until then you won't be able to access your coins.

As others have pointed out before, and as Litecoin has recently discovered, the real value of BTC is in it's unmatched hashing rate. Any infrastructure from here on out really needs to be built on top of the existing infrastructure to be reliable. Unless I misunderstood the article.

I think remittances are hard, because to use Bitcoin to move fiat, you get hit on both sides by exchange rates which end up being higher than sending fiat money the traditional way. Great if Bitcoin goes up in price enough to make it feasible and you have enough time to wait. 
Only in an ideal world where you never needed to convert out of Bitcoin would it become viable for remittances.

British currency used to be denoted in pounds, shillings and pence.

Shillings had 1, 2 and 2.5 (called a 'half crown' shillings. 1 shilling = 12 pence
Pounds were as normal, and 1 pound = 8 half crowns or 240 pence.

Bloomberg's ticker was another big one that made me pause for thought. I was listening to an older bitcoin podcast from Feb where someone from wall street said that no-one will take it seriously until it had it's own ticker on Bloomberg. When I tell people about bitcoin for the first time, it makes a huge difference when I tell them it's a listed commodity on Bloomberg.

[Coinfloor]( is a UK-based exchange for those who don't know; and allow free UK bank deposits over £500 (if memory serves). Their BTC price is usually around £10 cheaper per coin than localbitcoins so are becoming a viable option for many higher volume purchasers.

Ah, I see. So maybe something might happen where someone selling bitcoins on localbitcoins would have to register as a money transmitter and the like if regulations went through in NYC.

I think after the rampant expectations of 2014, a dose of under-balling things might be good ;) 
Good point about Bitcoins' Killer app. To be honest though of the many things that attracted me about bitcoin in the first place only a few have come to be implemented so far; tipping for example. I'm still waiting on the original attractions to really come into being, for instance autonomous corporations, micropayments implemented in more than 50% of the online services I use, international money transfers cheaper than my bank, etc. 
Hell, I'm still waiting on a quick way I can buy bitcoins reliably at or very very near to market value where I live. Come on coinbase, get your shit together!
To me the biggest thing to happen in 2015 will be the inevitability; the 'when' and not 'if' a company is going to accept bitcoin and then the service offerings that will entail. It sounds small, but to me it will be fascinating to see what Silicon valley can do when they don't need the banks anymore. 
I'm also not convinced we'll see a bubble in 2015; the only thing on the horizon that would trigger something like that for me is The Halvening of 2016, and even then it might take a while.

Interesting, what kinds of features could ethereum implement that bitcoin couldn't? 
@_date: 2014-06-20 06:56:57
Don't know for sure if it will or not, but if it does it will be because it's inherent properties (programmable, open source, decentralised value) lead to widespread use on the internet for digital services and value exchange. 
Want to add a tipping service to your Internet forum? You don't have to wait for paypal to write the software or get permission from your bank, and you won't have to pay the fees they'd want to charge for the micro transactions. 
Want to incorporate value transfer into your minecraft server or some other kind of multiplayer game? That's cool, we'll just wait until Chase Bank implement some kind of API and have minecraft players stop what their doing and input their credit card details every time they want to pay for something. Or.... we can write our own software and seamlessly integrate payments with bitcoin, without permission from anyone. 
Somewhere out there is an all rounder killer app for bitcoin, that would make even your aunts and uncles want to learn how to use it, much in the same way that media distribution was the internet's killer app. Want to spread an article you wrote, a video, or a photo? Imagine trying to do any of that pre-internet. Good luck unless you're working for a newspaper, Cable channel company, or national geographic. The internet was just orders of magnitude better and was so good even tech-phobes wanted to figure it out. 
So far I don't think we've seen this killer app yet, likely it will be in many different shapes and forms in the same way media distribution was, but like the internet the groundwork has been lain, and all it will take is someone to implement it.

You know, I know exactly what you mean.... I originally had some money set aside for a high-risk high-return investment of some kind that I had yet to decide on, and was starting to lean towards investing in Facebook because I thought it was a hugely undervalued company. But the process of trying to register for a stock exchange, and needing a US address and the bullshit that came along as well as the waiting period was SUCH a pain I never ended up getting around to it. 
Then one fateful friday afternoon, I read an article about bitcoin, I think it was about the norwegian guy who bought an apartment with it... and started googling around. I couldn't stop thinking about it all the way home from work, and ended up spending the entire weekend gorging myself on information and watching youtube videos. 
No matter how low the price has gone, I have never lost my initial fascination with the possibilities that Bitcoin represents and the underlying technology, and there is no way I could not be part of this.

You know what really grinds my gears? How hard it is to get onto the internet.

Nevermind that you can then only talk to people who ALSO have a computer connected to the internet... This is probably seriously holding the internet back and could be it's downfall.

Not disagreeing with you, but just wanted to point out:
- if you think bitcoin is energy wasting or environmentally unfriendly, you should read up on gold mining
- as for government impotence and online crime, you're basically making the following choice with bitcoin: "would I rather have law and order via giving the government total control and oversight of of my finances and communication, or would I rather have personal freedom and law and order via a better policing system?". Just because bitcoin makes crime easier and more anonymous does not make it a bad thing, it means our police need to get better.

You know, thinking about it, I think blogs are kind of redundant now. You would be better off posting self-posts here in the bitcoin subreddit, where people would actually read and comment on them, and you could be voted up or down depending on the zeitgeist of the subreddit. 
Which makes me wonder if or why not website like Wordpress haven't already done something similar? Say you're a science blogger and you write really interesting blogposts about science. For someone to read them currently you have to have them 'discover' your blog, link to you on theirs and play a bizzare popularity game where you get more and more readers. 
Instead, wordpress should just let blogs pick, like, 5 categories for their blog, and have a front page for each category. There would be a 'new' and a 'controversial' just like reddit but the front page would collect them all. 
Then if you liked that person's post, you could go read the rest of their blog or subscribe to them personally. Reddit's good at the voting system and is fairly savvy dealing with astroturfing, but not so good for the blogging side of things; i.e. I can't flick through all your comments and submissions easily and they're not organised as well as a blog is. 
Nothing to do with bitcoin, just a thought.

Holy unnecessary religious parallels, batman!
Well since you've asked, I'm now known in my circle of friends as the bitcoin obsessive, so I guess I'll look like an idiot if this all goes down in flames, (yay, reputations!) and every now and again people approach me to find out how they can get some or what they can use it for; so at least they have a contact that can guide them through the process. 
After a lot of these encounters, what I've realised is that Bitcoin really needs a 'killer app' before any of them will want to put money into it. 
I'm not sure what that killer app will be... possibly, it will be a lot of things to a lot of people. Maybe in WoW, Bitcoin will become the default method for buying weapons or whatever, and that will be a killer app if you play WoW, or maybe the next Candy Crush will feature bitcoin payments and that will be a killer app to the 18-30 year old women who like those. Maybe online porn will adopt it and that will be a killer app for people willing to pay for porn. I know there are certainly a few countries out there where Bitcoin's killer app is it's security for wealth storage, and capital flight. 
To me, bitcoin has a lot of 'killer app' features but none of them are of any interest to the vast majority of the people around me, who are only interested in counting their pennies... I don't know how to pitch bitcoin to them. 
I've almost always been an early adopter of any new technology so this doesn't really surprise me. Right now what I'm seeing is a shit load of infrastructure being built (ATM's going up in major cities, walk-in exchanges, bitcoin banks in Cyprus) but I'm still waiting to see the Killer App that will make even the average person need some.

The problem (if you're a government) with bitcoin is that as long as it has value somewhere in the world, you can't stop your citizens from buying and using it. Even if the US outright banned it tomorrow the rest of the world could still adopt it and they'd just be left out of the loop. 
This will stunt the price in the short term but eventually they're only stopping themselves from gaining from it in the long run.

For myself so far, even in this nascent stage of it's development, and in spite of it's volatility, 'killer' applications so far have been:
- Having a banking system that I can use in any country without incurring extra fees, or spending/withdrawal limits. 
- Sending monetary value abroad, and to places banks won't go (Ukraine &amp;amp; Snowden)
- A much more streamlined and safe online internet payment system
- Free banking to Merchants: I like the idea that if you're a mom &amp; pop store selling general goods, you could accept bitcoin and choose to be paid straight out to fiat or even HODL some as bitcoin without having to go through a bank or credit card service, and that many of these businesses which live or die on tiny margins, will be able to bypass all of the current system completely (except for needing a standard bank account to deposit fiat into).

Dude, you are blowing my freaking mind. I would like to subscribe to your newsletter. 
What really shits me up is that... this is all pretty much ready to go... all the infrastructure is there. All it needs is for someone to program it in. No need to make huge deals and negotiations with banks, decide on payment provider, anything. Just a few programmers and a lot of coffee. 
Going back to MMO's for a second, I think bitcoin is ripe for EvE players to take it and run with it. They're already dealing in a live financial environment and used to having real-world money bleeding into the game, this will just make it that much easier. Your idea of putting real-world rewards (like subscription time or just simply bitcoin payouts) into the game for players providing a service is extremely potent, especially with their side-game Dust. Imagine players having to invest bitcoin to build structures, which is then given as a reward to any army that takes it over.  
One other thought; what if people could start pledging bitcoin towards large tournaments? Twitch already has the audience for it. People could create large pools to have teams play each other and fund their own tournaments to be streamed live. 
DOTA and Starcraft seems a likely candidate for this...  Someone get an exchange over to South Korea!

This is what I'm interested in; seeing the coinbase-like business model being set up in multiple countries, allowing people to send money faster and potentially cheaper than other methods. The more streamlined this method gets the more people will use it.

Definitely. If the NYC exchange is selling at 10% higher than the people on localbitcoins even a wall street 'fat cat' will just go down the road instead.

While those fees are pretty high; remember that if someone takes bitcoin they get hit with 1% taking it out of changetip and then another 1% exchanging BTC to fiat somewhere else like coinbase; plus their BTC might lose 20% of it's value by the end of the month and will fluctuate a lot in between; suddenly that 5% cut doesn't seem so bad. 
Crypto nerds like us will of course be OK with that but it does worry me that this will be preferable for *most of* the US and other countries. The better option doesn't always win in the long run. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 06:35:06
I think this is interesting he's talking a lot about remittances, but actually I think this might be more of an attack on visa. 
Coinbase in these countries means that merchants can process bitcoin payments and pay a flat 1% fee compared to whatever paypal and visa charge in their countries (2%?); which might be a lot in some of the more obscure ones. A lot of those merchants might be living on a margin of only 5% so that's quite big.

As I understand it, there can only be one block in the blockchain per 10 minutes, and this means that Bitcoin as it currently stands couldn't handle true mass adoption yet? For instance if snoop dogg released his album only in Bitcoin, it would bring the entire network to a halt. 
Is this true? And if so, are the developers doing anything to fix it?

It's similar to if a coin accumulated 'days' while sitting in an address. When you send that coin, it resets back to '0' and it'd 'Bitcoin days' are 'destroyed'. 
Hence when you see huge amounts of Bitcoin days being destroyed, it means some coins that haven't moved in a very long time have just been moved. Possibly someone who had been sitting on their coins from the beginning just sold them or moved them into a different address.

Yeah interesting point. We're also missing the seamless way to buy bitcoin for the average consumer at market price and start using it to pay for things; hence why I'm feeling slightly pessimistic in that regard with paypal not offering conversion services. Coinbase still seems to be the best model for that (not sure what will happen with Circle, but then again I don't live in a country where either are supported yet so maybe I'm biased). 
Best case scenario Paypal or Coinbase allows instantaneous conversion at near market rates, or Circle does this and spreads across the globe. That, or if bitcoin becomes a normal use currency on the internet, for your workplace to offer part of your salary in bitcoin (which I would sign up for, frankly).
Also good point about the 'killer app' for average consumer. My feeling is that rather than a killer app becoming the reason for people to use bitcoin, it will just get to the point where certain websites we take for granted become hard to use without it; i.e. what if youtube offered an ad-free micropayment viewing option, or you're heavily involved with skyrim and want to buy mods? It will just start to become a situation where you're gradually shut off from all these cool services you want to use. 
Note: Microsoft owns Minecraft now. 
I'd be looking at companies like Google, Apple, Valve and Microsoft to see what 'killer apps' they can come up with, especially once they bake bitcoin right into the core of their code. If I knew what that app was going to be I wouldn't be working where I am right now.

Disclaimer: the only headphones I use are Apple's, because they're cheap and expendable and for some reason in-ear headphones don't tend to work for me. 
If I had any real opinions, I'd say that all headphones in general are going to suck and they're a compromise for listening to music while you're walking around. 
There's also the fact that the majority of big over-the-ear headphones looks ridiculous on me (same problem with hats) and for people that want over the ear headphones maybe beats are the only ones that don't look stupid. 
I'm just saying there's more to the equation... and frankly if you're (not *you* specifically, people in general) the kind of person that starts pulling out charts to show frequency content for different headphones, then you have no business talking to the average (i.e. doesn't read reviews of different headphones) consumer.

You are quite correct to see this trend; but I think that the world by and large will trend towards the open source system that doesn't require permission than waiting around for the credit cards to get off their asses and give them all permission (after filling out forms to register) individually on a case by case basis. 
I'd also wonder why you would create an internet service, accessible anywhere in the world, and then only let people pay in dollars when by using bitcoin anyone can pay. 
This goes back to my thinking of currencies as economic systems; by having dollars you are able to participate in US-based dollar economies, by having bitcoin you are able to take part in a world-wide digital economy. In time, I think the second of the two will be the busier. 
Ask yourself this; why can't I tip you a dollar on reddit using a credit card?

I can't even tell you how happy news like this makes me, but honestly, in a country with currency controls as strict as they are in Argentina, I just can't see for the life of me how a legitimate exchange could be set up without some kind of crippling tax or outright ban from the government to make it completely worthless. 
On that note, I think that if the government did actually ban Bitcoin down there it would cause a cascade of buying the likes of which even god has never seen.

- Most common mistake is making a brain wallet using a non-random input, like song lyrics. Brain wallets are safe, but ONLY if you use a long, totally random input. See some of my [beginners guides]( for more details on this. 
- My personal opinion on this is to use Diceware to generate a long, unique and random input as a brain wallet which makes it easier to generate a comprehensible, random input that you could feasibly write down, assuming you're not dyslexic. Again, read my guide on this for more info.

My personal opinion is that for BTC to overcome this problem, we would need one or all of the following: 
a) hardware that is comparable to contactless visa payments, not entirely out of the realm of possibility as bitcoin is hackable, programmable, and open source. 
b) services for bitcoin not possible or easy with fiat; i.e. website tipping, IT support forum micro payments, news website pay-per-view, etc etc. One great example of this so for me, someone who travels a lot, is piiko.com which has already saved my ass on numerous occasions. 
c) coinbase-like options that make it so damn easy to buy bitcoin that it becomes a trivial thing. 
d) specific areas in cities where you can spend bitcoins up and down an entire street. Enthusiasts would probably start going out of your way to use these businesses and it would become a hub for crypto. 
I personally think we'll see more of B options before anything else; but I think for now your debit card is probably good enough for things like coffee ;)

Last year we would have shit a brick if anyone from PayPal had even mentioned bitcoin in passing. This is pretty big. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 11:27:20
A couple of things:
**1. Most people still have no idea bitcoin even exists** 
Your conclusion relies on the vast majority of people who potentially might use bitcoin to have heard of bitcoin, looked into it and decided it wasn't worth their time. In my own sphere of 600+ people I would say less than 20 of them have even heard of bitcoin outside me telling them about it. Of those 600+ almost all of them use facebook and email, which makes them potential bitcoin users. Even in Argentina, where bitcoin could be a ground breaking innovation, according to most articles I've read most people there have never even heard of it. [I've posted]( my own thoughts on what bitcoin could potentially mean for both Argentinians and other South Americans. 
I also want to give you an example of when someone went from not caring about bitcoin to being fascinated by it. If I took the average joe and told them I could buy a coffee in starbucks with bitcoin, they wouldn't give the slightest crap. But if I bought them a coffee in starbucks from the other side of the world, instantaneously, they would be impressed. I met a fairly knowledgeable bitcoin skeptic while travelling not too long ago who thought it was a crock of shit. He needed to go into town that day to recharge his phone, so I recharged it for him using bitcoin and [piiko]( near instantaneously; it blew his mind. Suddenly, bitcoin was a hugely useful tool. Even if he didn't have bitcoin, he could just message me with his number and I could have recharged it even when I flew back to my country. 
See? People aren't necessarily blown away by bitcoin as it stands; they're going to be blown away by the kinds of services that traditional business models can't do, but can be built [by only two people]( when you use bitcoin (as is the case with piiko). Whether you think these services will continue to be built in the future is up to you; the current BTC startup investment (of which most was in the last year) stands at around $260M. 
EDIT: I wanted to add that I probably heard of bitcoin 3 or 4 times on forums and other places before I seriously looked into it and bought some. I'd wonder if there wasn't some kind of latency where not only have people not heard of bitcoin, they need to hear about it several times before really taking it seriously. 
**2. People will follow profit, competition favours the tech-savvy**
People don't care about bitcoin yet because they can't profit/use it to save money yet. My personal opinion is that as soon as one small group of people find a way to use it to profit then others will find out and follow suit. An example of this might be when remittances are cheaper using bitcoin than any other service; immigrants who use it will profit more than those who don't and the others will follow suit. 
This is of course assuming someone figures out how to do remittances using bitcoin. As of right now though, a Filipino living and working abroad can already [pay his/her family's utilities bills]( cheaper than if he wired money back via western union.   
Another thing for you to consider: how would a service like piiko happen without bitcoin? You would need a bank in every country for people that wanted to use your service, and then you would have to negotiate a system with those banks to pay for top ups and move money around, so maybe it would be US only and you'd lose business from several other countries... you get my point. IMO this is a paradigm shift for startup companies; so much more is possible now because of bitcoin that wasn't before. The services traditionally supplied by banks aren't good enough for the digital age, they're holding back innovation and are ripe for disruption. 
The best example of this is my [previous post]( on the credit card situation in south america. If a merchant is paying upwards of 10% fees for credit cards, how do you think they're going to react to people paying with bitcoin and getting to exchange it to pesos for 1% as is the case with [Bitpagos]( That is a revolutionary, tectonic-sized paradigm shift. 
Another example of something that is trivially easy to set up compared to fiat money: website and forum tipping i.e Changetip. 
**3. Bitcoin isn't a novel concept**
There have been many precursors to bitcoin, and people have been trying to have a digital worldwide currency for years. Look at egold and liberty dollars; there is a demand for something like bitcoin to exist, but the only question is whether bitcoin is 'it'. The critical innovation that Satoshi gave to digital currency that had been missing before was it's decentralization. My opinion is that Satoshi has in fact 'cracked' it, and then some. This technology will impact economics, politics, computer science and international commerce, in ways we can't even predict yet. An open source decentralised ledger is a fundamental paradigm shift never before seen in history. This is the most interesting and exciting technology I have seen introduced in my lifetime. 
**4. Bitcoin isn't even a finished product yet**
One thing you're neglecting is that every time someone makes even a simple innovation to bitcoin, it creates a gigantic chain reaction of innovation along with it. This year that innovation was multisignatures, allowing a private key to be broken down into three or more components. A simple concept, but it's already made things like Open Bazaar and Bitgo possible. Your opinion seems to rest on bitcoin being a static invention, a finished product, when in fact it's still under heavy development and innovation. 
Hopefully some of this made sense, I'm writing this in a hurry. I'm entirely open to the possibility I'll end up being wrong about bitcoin, but these are some of the reasons I think you need to look at the long term and think about your position. 
EDIT: Thanks for the gold xxx

Colombia also has one of the lowest inflation rates in South America; though it's still high at around 15%... do you think this matters to most of the people there?

If I understand correctly, the maximum transactions per second wouldn't be able to handle the traffic so bitcoin would come to a grinding halt until someone figured out how to increase it. 
Worse; this would mean the only transactions that could go through are the ones with the highest fees, so you would see that increase to a huge extent too.

Yes, steam would be a game changer. I'd take Steam over any of the other guys in the short term. 
Imagine tipping someone a game, and the changetip bot finds out how much the game is instantly and varies the tip based on whether it's on sale or not, or whether they own the game already (you could have the option to register your steam account with changetip for example). Or imagine if you could access their wishlist and tip the smallest or largest thing on there for instance.

I'm happy to hear this news but I'm also skeptical of how well this will really work in practice. If everyone held bitcoins they would be safe from government interference in Cyprus; however centralising them under one roof (especially in physical cold storage) still makes them vulnerable to government interference; i.e. seizing bitcoins or worse. 
Still; glad to see progress being made and services for the average joes popping up.

Thanks for the explanation; some good ideas in there, but I guess my gut reaction is that untraceable transactions are not as high on the priority list for most people as dark'ers might believe, and it's better to use Coinjoin for those that need it rather than try to build a whole new crypto for it. In fact although the mood seems to be that Coinjoin will never be put into the BTC core, that's probably all it would take to kill off something like DRK.

Before bitcoin, the technology that detailed transactions between banks and across countries was guarded, closed down, and no to very limited access given to anyone who wanted to innovate and build on the technology. One bad actor with access to this technology could bring the whole network down. The Linus Torvalds, the Steve Jobs, the Bill Gates etc of the banking world would never have been allowed inside the building where they could innovate and build on the technology. Any innovation has to be vetted by a huge group of banking managers, and there is no incentive for them to ever do anything that would benefit the common person. 
With bitcoin, the technology is open source, anyone with the right knowledge can innovate with the technology, and as long as they don't control 51% of the network power the technology is safe. 
Somewhere out there in the world, right now, a teenager is reading the wikipedia article on bitcoin and he's already thinking of a technology he could build with it that will make entire industries obsolete.

Well no it's not perfect, but my follow up to this is to consider sending a letter to your neighbour vs sending a letter to someone in New Zealand in the pre-email days. 
Pre email, sending a letter was orders of magnitude both more expensive, and more time consuming than sending a message to your neighbour. Not only that, it was more complicated because you had to include several pieces of data (name, street, country...). 
Then email came along and you only needed one piece of information; their email. Not only that, it was orders of magnitude quicker than letters and just as cheap as sending a letter to your neighbour. 
Consider what it's like to send money to someone next door to you vs sending money to New Zealand.... it's a complete pain in the ass, the same situation we were in before emails. Bitcoin is an obvious answer to that problem, it levels the entire internet connected world. 
Ps- thanks for the tip though! Er... 1 whole satoshi!

Not until there's a way of directly outputting sent money as fiat. Currently the best way is to send BTC and then that person sells it on localbitcoins (maybe even for a profit). 
But if we're all using bitcoins to buy things on a day to day basis, then maybe.

Your average person does not know about this. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:41:52
You say currently; if the price of Bitcoin goes past the good parity we hit in November would this make small mining operations profitable? 
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:27:37
This definitely sounds like a good idea. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 08:19:13
The rule for the last year seems to have been "if it's not going up then it's going down" ie sideways action always seems to be followed by huge dumping

De ja vu

But the blockchain app is still there bizarrely... 
As an apple fan I think this is just a sign of a company taking time to adjust to new technology and being overly paranoid at the offset... Give them time, I think they'll come around. 
Or I'm wrong and they're evil, I don't know.

Your last question has been my primary daydream of late.

I'll take it

And he seems crazy and eccentric enough to force these businesses to accept it. Could be interesting. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:00:25
This is me now. I'm more interested in the mechanisms and especially the different things people are doing with it than I am with price shifts :)
Just took my friend through creating an online wallet and buying his first BTC... sniff... he's all growed up now.... 
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:08:37
websites like blockchain.info will allow you to upload addresses to a wallet using the private key. Clients like Armory or Electrum should also import addresses but I'm not 100% sure about this. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:19:10
Is there a version that wont burn in my screen? 
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:18:26
I agree, but what would an easier seamless way of buying Bitcoins look like? I'm imagining something like the BTC ATM machines popping up in malls and such.

It will increase in the long term, probably, but in the short term it will go up and down between 20% gain and 60% loss. 
Stick my entire savings in that? No thanks. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:39:27
Is that a typo in the title? Did he mean freenode instead of freednode?
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:42:42
I think this is awesome and would personally love to see the spread of bitcoin in Colombia :) 
Keep up the great work! 
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:38:14
I meant it protects the US, not the USD. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:11:16
Yes!!! Awesome!
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:27:09
Right now the USD is still a world currency. By 2020 that will likely not be the case anymore. If the usd switched to BTC and BTC became a major currency (if!) then it would have dodged a bullet. If they did it quickly enough they could crater the other countries banks before they flooded the market with USD. 
Not that I think this will happen, just theorising. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:48:06

1oz Platinum = $1476.78
That's a good mark for when bitcoin surpasses gold :)

That will be youtube gold in 5 years if Bitcoin goes to the moon

Where or how do you accept the tip? Just curious as I'm still figuring it out.

This is the gif on bitcoinity:
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:16:47
I think Amazon accepting Bitcoin will turn out to be a watershed moment. Really interested to see when this happens. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:41:00
I know this was a long time ago, but could you elaborate on this? How does coin base handle offline transactions? How does it help? 
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:12:31
This is interesting to me because I actually asked my local comic book store if they took bitcoin and they just laughed at me, but I think these stores are ideally poised to be one of the first starters whose crowds would be more tech savvy and into something like bitcoin.

Holy shit, this is an honour and a privilege sir. Consider my fedora tipped. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:17:07
The first that came off the top of my head are:
1. Reaching $1000/BTC (already there now)
2. 1BTC = 1oz Gold
3. Bitcoin symbol being put on keyboards
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:51:59
I see your point; but honestly do you have the stomach to watch your entire house deposit lose and gain by that much every day? If I lost 60% of my savings in one day like that last dip I'd probably feel sick, even if I thought I was sure it would go back up eventually. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:46:49
I absolutely love this idea. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:25:12
Perfect, that's exactly what I was wondering. However if I'm not planning on spending any of my cold storage coins for a few years (hence, why they're in cold storage) then this second step isn't necessary until I need to sell them right? 
i.e. in five years I can just open up a new installation with the created wallet files and sell them that way? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:43:34
Good point

How safe is blockchain.info? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:47:07
Mate, read up on diamonds some more, biggest pile of bullshit marketing you will ever come across. Not a good comparison for Bitcoins (unless I and a lot of other people are sorely mistaken). 
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:36:39
Did anyone watch it till the end and catch the  complete nutcase at around 22.50? What the fuck is the teleos of Christ?

I'd love to use armory but he seems fixed on developing for linux first and everything else later
@_date: 2013-11-11 11:53:16
If I just create a new user on my OSX machine and not connect to the Internet and do all this, isn't it just as safe as using Linux?

My great grandparents grew up in a world that had horses and carriages, and ended their lives in a world where man was walking on the moon. 
It is absolutely staggering for me to think, in view of this, what will happen in our lifetimes.

There's a new website called bitflog, but as far as I can tell it doesn't have much in the way of features like seller rating etc 
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:42:26
Amazon and Starbucks accepting Bitcoin will be the tipping point for me I think. That's when average joe will find out about it.
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:47:59
Thinking about this, it would probably be a good idea to have your wallets each only containing less than it would be profitable to spend the time hacking into them by someone else. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:56:10
This is an exellent idea.
