"Looking at the situation one quarter later, it is clear to us that the Blockstream fork of bitcoin diverges so radically from the ideas presented in the Bitcoin white paper, that it is an evolutionary dead end. " Blockstream fork, they did not fork :D

There is some pump-n-dump right now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:14:05
The b-trash fanboys are pumping and dumping, that's all. We have seen in and we will be seeing it in future... they try to take our btc cheap.

mempool is being spamed by low fee "dust" transaction, it costs about $5 mln a day, they will stop sooner or later :)
no matter, that they collect from fees when mining double the amount...
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:32:17

@_date: 2018-05-28 18:43:51
Only the golden one! The rest are forks.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:18:28
Trollbox exploded
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:47:03
It’s so secure, that one day even you won’t remember how to access the coins.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:23:09
Because it is centralised! And I’m far from scared, after each artificial pump, price slowly deflates, it will always be like this.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:35:32

Just keep small amount of btc on a exchange and after the fork send to all your private addresses from the exchange. Their coins will be tinted and after that your transactions won’t be possible to be replayed on the b2x chain.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:53:11
Is this an official financial advise? Would you pay me back if it turns out is not the best scenario?!

@_date: 2017-11-04 20:14:26
come and see ;)
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:24:38
No man, keep your main amount of btc at offline wallet. After the fork send small amount from the exchange to your private offline wallet(same address your coins are in). Then you can move the btc and use the private key to obtain the b2x. The btc will be safe and unreplayable. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:51:20
After 4 hours they will
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:27:40
Hahah, nice one :) I make fun of bicash, u get it?
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:03:46
There is still time other pools to pull back, they need to restart in order to remove the NYA tag.
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:15:22
Little bit too early, I think.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:13:57
