Damn, I wish i could go back in time and sell.  I'm still disappointed that my wife said "wait until it hits 25k", when it was at 19.5+

Holy shit!!  Yup. That’s the same image.  
Maybe this was all a giant con.

I bought in at just under 10k... and slowly have been buying in, here and there when I can, with small drops. 
I'm holding out as long as I can.  Like most advice, I haven't invested more than I'm willing to lose. 
My wife invested at both 13400 (two days ago)  and 14000 (today). Again, nothing more than were willing to lose if bitcoin tanks to complete 0.  I asked her today if she wanted to sell her first investment for some profit she said "nah, let's see what happens, this is fun."     
We talk about this daily. Yes, I regret not investing in BTC when I heard about it more than 4 years ago, but hey, I probably would've sold out on the first big jump, so it isn't as if I would've been a billionaire or anything. 
I love you guys, thanks for the new hobby

This.   
I too missed the boat when I didn’t follow my gut instincts.   This is twice in my life, first with early google stock. Next was my friend letting me know about bit coin when it was about a year or less old. 
But as someone else said. Most people wouldn’t have held onto it past the first jump, let alone from now until today.  
I agree with Brody, look into the next thing.

This isn’t good.    
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:21:52
...so for those of us who invested in at 10K you say we should take the 4k dip then? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:44:18
Respond with susccess.  Don’t engage someone who has no interest, it wastes both of your time. 
I work with two people who can’t grasp this concept.  They say bubble bubble bubble and this won’t ever go up.  Yaddi    Same bullshit everyone else who is a sclerotic says.  Yet I’m about to double my investment.   So there is that.

This is a move to STOP trading coins and push everything back to what they understand and control.  
This could make it so that all is based traction’s must go through them.

How does this differ than any of the hundred other botnets for sell / rent floating around on the internet ? 
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:08:47
Well they do have the credit of being the people who rented a botnet and took down a already weakened service. 
Anyone with half a brain would know that they're already on the FBI's hit list, and you're just asking to be caught renting anything from these guys. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:41:34
You have a point. 
I would say that publicly bragging about it and doing an interview with the BBC isn't the smartest decision in the first place.  Sony's network is already under investigation from the FBI about the recent hack. 
I can easily see Sony pointing the blame towards those who actually hacked them, at these group of kids as well. So they're basically F'd in the A. when it comes down to it.

The irony is that people are telling other people not to sell because it benefits them, not the people who want to sell. 
take everything you read with a grain of salt. If you want out, sell. It is your money, do what you want with it.

it should. op has a vested interest in you holding so he can sell his share before you do ;)
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:21:29
agree. 
the dude was a piece of shit.   just because other people out there are pieces of shits, it doesn't take away from what he did.

You can do this through a proxy. Find someone who is not in our country, Canada perhaps, and donate to him. What he does with the funds after given to him, makes no difference to you.  As long as you did not willingly know what he was going to do with them, you should be in the clear.
