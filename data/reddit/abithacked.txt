You're talking like you have your 60% assets back already. All you have is a shady company on extremely thin legal ice making illegal propositions and empty promises at the moment. I just can't fathom why you would heap praise on a company which just lost 70mill worth of customer funds and is essentially denying all liability and throwing the customer under the bus. On top of all this there's no formal press conference, just some kid on here flip flopping about what resolution the company will take and avoiding tough questions. Push over wanks like you is why companies get away with this illegal shit.
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:54:28
Well, given that they are leaning towards the resolution I alluded to it seems I have a better understanding than you. I'm not being selfish, you don't even know my position and what I own in terms of assets on BFX - I'm simply giving you my honest opinion and with some relevant experience on these matters.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:22:13
No. Bitcoin was stolen, no alts nor USD. Off-setting bitcoin loss would require them to take my USD and disperse it between users, which I forbid them to do. Their terms of service cover them from bitcoin loss. Legal counsel? LOL, they are winging this 100%. Go on, ask your pal Zane about the legality in what they're doing.
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:28:03
Mind my own business? Lol a company essentially misappropriating 10s of thousands of my dollars is kind of my business, shill.
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:15:16
Agreed. But these criminals have taken it upon themselves to divvy up everyone's assets like a fucking birthday cake

They would have much less legal issues if they let bitcoin holders take the hit. 
I wonder how much our BFX coin will be worth once they're liquidated.
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:51:36
I dont believe what they are doing is legal in the slightest. They are citing a liquidation scenario wiithout going bankrupt - it's ludicrous. The blatent illegal activity makes me think no one will see a dime. Not to mention the complete 180 in direction in terms of socialised losses, they have no idea what they are doing
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:45:58
Yeah, but they are treating customer accounts as their own and distributing them as they please. There's still 120,000 bitcoins missing. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:28:17
That's because Synapse understand legal implications of withholding USD - BFX either don't understand or are purposely committing theft. Most likely the latter.
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:44:44
stfu - they have not answered one question of substance. Furthermore, they have dragged all their customers into their fuckup and are proposing an illegal distribution of customer assets. "Honorable"? Shill.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:46:28
So only 40%? Oh wow, that's great news. Only tens of thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:38:04
I deposited USD at your exchange to trade digital currencies, not to buy shares in you incompetent, clown of a company. Is Bitfinex making financial decisions for its customers now? Send us our fucking money back it has nothing to do with your hack
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:29:54
Let me reiterate - THEY HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHT OVER CUSTOMER ASSETS AND DISBURSING THEM AGAINST YOUR WILL IS NOTHING LESS THAN CRIMINAL. (Until they are ordered to liquidate.)
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:55:46
Yeah, you would say that. Unfortunately, unless they file for bankruptcy they can't simply reimburse your stolen bitcoins with others' USD - that's just retarded and illegal.
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:23:28
We just invested involuntarily into a company which is currently not operational, has lost trust of 99.99% of customers, is completely insecure, run by apparent morons and just had $80,000,000 of assets wiped from the books.
Whatever it's worth I think we overpaid.
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:39:07
Yeap, we need full transparency. But we won't get it, they are shady mofos
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:48:00
40% on fresh, untraded USD deposits is criminal.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:34:04
They obviously dont have legal counsel, they make this shit up as they go
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:16:36
We thought you already did, that's what you stated anyway.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:28:10
There is no BANKCRUPTCY, Bitfinex has NO legal liability in regards to the hack. You CANNOT SIMULATE LIQUIDATION. It either happens or doesn't. They are ILLEGALLY allocating USD to cover another asset class from a set of customers who had bitcoin stolen. The irony is they will probably go bankrupt once all the lawsuits come.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:41:18
The other important point is Mt. Gox filed bankcruptcy and was liquidated. Bitfinex is proposing to distribute customer funds without any formal process. FUCKING ILLEGAL
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:59:50
New all times highs? So what your saying is our potential loss is many times greater than 36%. Thanks for the consolation.
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:16:48
What BFX is proposing is more illegal than the hack itself
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:13:48
They obviously have no legal counsel and are winging this whole thing. You are correct, they have no legal right to distribute and allocate our USD as they please. They are citing a liquidation scenario and in the meantime looking for investors lol what a bunch of criminals. BFX coin is going to be worthless like the repuation of the company
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:16:19
If bitcoin deposited after is not affected, then how about USD deposits after?
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:11:57
70mill stolen.. you'd think that would warrant a press conference or something or some kind of formal Q+A. Instead they send some kid to reddit to cherry pick questions. Their recent 180 on socialising the loss across all asset classes just shows they're making this shit up. We still don't even know what percentage of BTC the hack affected, USD holders probably got burned to cover legal costs for future lawsuits. Corporate crooks
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:48:27
Errr, allocating my cash deposit to other users without my authorisation and against my direct orders? Yeah, that's criminal
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:17:58
"The BFX tokens will remain outstanding until redeemed in full by Bitfinex or possibly exchanged—upon the creditor’s request and Bitfinex’s acceptance—for shares of iFinex Inc. "
No one else is worried about this shit? Bitfinex needs to accept our tokens for shares. What if they don't accept? Where else could they possibly derive any value from?
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:34:06
Well, I hope you see this. You have alluded to fresh bitcoin deposits (post hack) not being subject to haircuts. Surely this is also true for USD deposits??
@_date: 2016-08-07 18:58:16
+1 illegal
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:20:01
As someone who recently sent USD funds which were not even credited to my account, I refuse to bail out anyone or take any kind of a 'haircut'. If someone gets mugged on a train, its not up to all the passengers to compensate their ill-fate. Your reputation will never recover. Let the people who lost coins take the hit and slowly repay them, regain their trust you were so fucking reckless with.
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:49:06
Why do people keep bringing up insolvency? As far as I can tell, these crooks aren't legally liable for anything. Instead, they're illegally off setting customer losses with other customer assets in some attempt to soften the blow for btc holders. They seem to think they have ownership of customer funds. This shit is going to sink quicker than hot lead in shit
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:00:16
Yeap. Agreed.
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:41:30
Fortunately for Fiat holders, Bitfinex has absolutely no legal right to try and cover losses with customers' USD funds. Whatever ambiguity they may try to hide behind in regards to digital coins or their lack of liability outlined in the terms and services, they can't pull any bs with our cash. That's if they remain solvent anyway.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:47:01
It's not insolvent if it doesn't accept liability of your stolen bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:31:03
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:21:09
They're pretty easy to spot. They say things like: 
"Wow, this is not actually too bad. 40% reduction in net wealth overnight - oh well better than waiting 4 years".
"It's all our fault for having anything to do with Bitcoin - it's the Wild West out here!"
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:28:10
And why the sudden change in plan? You still havent explained any reasoning what so ever.
@_date: 2016-08-12 09:01:03
Upvoted all comments to help counter corrupt downvoting. Good luck boys
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:32:46
Yeah... NO. its not fucking legal. Bitfinex will be sued to oblivion, fuck with fiat and you're playing with the big boys
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:51:50
Mate, read the terms of service. Shit creek unfortunately.
@_date: 2016-08-07 01:41:47
40% of my funds down the shitter to bail out an asset class I had nothing to do with and no reasonable explanation or progress in access to my remaining 60%. Yeah, excellent news.
@_date: 2016-09-02 06:27:09
Accurate books? LOL
