How often do the dips like we had couple of days ago happen?
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:04:11
Would you call the one we had couple of days ago where it fell from 11.2k to 8k a crash?
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:25:35
this is amazing
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:43:11
Is this the first wave?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:35:32
I hope so. I want to buy at a dip.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:30:45
Feels like the calm before the storm.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:16:53
When did the last crash happen?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:02:48
We need a wall.

I put $200-250 on 15 to 20 altcoins each and set sell orders on all of them for around %10 profit.
Is this a good strategy? It takes hours, days or weeks for some of them to hit the mark but when it does I make profit. Would it be better just to hold?
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:59:23
These are good advices.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:31:02
Haha. No, not all of my money. Only the amount I decided investing in. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:09
I just wanted to ask something as I have only recently joined this business.
3/4 of my money is on bitcoin and some altcoins. The rest I use to buy some altcoins when they are low and sell when they are high. Is this a good strategy to make money in the long term? Or should I just put everything on bitcoin and hodl?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:34:48
My bad. English is not my native language.
I invested only some money in this coin business. If things go well I might put in a little more.
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:02:09
I understand people who put couple of months worth of salary into bitcoin. They are having fun. But this? No.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:54:19
Comments like this makes me wanna abandon crypto completely. 


What makes you say that?
@_date: 2018-11-22 05:28:02
Bro i'm totaly OK with it going back to 10k. I'm not asking for new ATH. Be humble.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:49:56
Can confirm. I am from Turkey and during the summer our currency lost a lot of value against almost every currency and exchanges fixed the converting rates. I converted most of my money to bitcoin and avoided losing money. I even made profit. This really changed my whole view on crypto currency. Yes it's not stable but it gives people a chance to be their own bank. You don't understand how important this is until you are put in a position like I've been in.

So many people are claiming that BTC will rise again and most of them show BTC's previous crashes as proof. This is so dumb. If you are investing in bitcoin then you are gambling. No one can know what's gonna happen to it in the next 2 years. Please stop giving people false hope. Crash or moon we don't know what's gonna happen.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:28:14
Yeah but the real rates were 1 USD = 7 TL while exchanges fixed the rates lower than that. I could buy USD at 7.1-7.2 and sell it at 6.8-6.9.
Turkish money's value was so volatile that they did this. It was impossible to avoid loss by converting fiat to fiat. Bitcoin was the only way.
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:39:57
It's best to wait and observe these next couple of months. People are saying it's bear market but it can go much lower than this. There is no point in taking a risk. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:05:45
Yeah but has bitcoin ever seen such huge exposure to everyday people like it has in 2017? What makes you think we will see a new all time high?
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:44:12

People wanna make others believe that this is a cycle and the current situation is only temporary. We don't fucking know that. Bitcoin has always been volatile. It could remain volatile in the $1000-2000 range for the next 5 years.
