does it matter if he is 8 or 89 or if he is a ceo or not? 
he asked for help to find a solution . 
its a shame so manny of you get personel on him. 
why not focus on the question 
what service would work for him? 
he said coinbase does not 
so what service would ? bitpay?

if this is a seriouse question well 
first it gets my biz back to me 
my bank knows all about my moves what i buy where i life where i go 
couse they see all my money transaktions even if i pay in a restaurant they see my bill 
second bitcoin is fast my bank isnt 
if i like to transfer on a sonday its inposible 
the transfer is done on next workday 
bitcoin transfers in seconds and usualy is confirmed in an hour. 
if there is a bailin well i am not sure if my money is save in my bank 
in my bitcoinwallet it is save 
but what is most important to me is that i am not anylonger transparent for the bank 
or the creditcard or the shop where i buy stuff
