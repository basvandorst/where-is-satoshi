Thank you. but the first link you gave is for adsense, instead of adwords.
It's not easy to find the correct link to report abuse of adwords.
I did not find it.
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:10:24
But if you take 1 penny from that, you will become criminal.
@_date: 2014-06-01 08:12:36
I knew this link, but I have reported it for 24 hours but his adwords account is still alive.
So I don't know if I choose the correct point.
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:12:00
More people got stolen by that on Google search. Check my post history.

You said "wait one week"? His ads stayed there for about one year.
He has many ad account, one being banned, he will use another.
"waiting to see" makes no sense.

It seems you hate what I am doing. By the way, I am curious which "one of these scammers" do you refer to? 
If you are scammers, I will go on to kill all these phishing site. Hope you can find a better job in the future.
If you are not one of these scammers, and if you love bitcoin, you can spend your time searching them and reporting them.

@_date: 2014-06-09 01:57:23
I reported several phishing sites and told people here to report, 
One moderator dislikes my action and he said "wait".
One of my friends here also received response for deleting his post  "I know you guys mean well, but that has been posted about 10 times in the last 24 hours. For the next few days, additional postings of this will be considered a duplicate, and removed accordingly."
