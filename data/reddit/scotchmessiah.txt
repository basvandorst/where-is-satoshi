Nice. Maybe the next step is Valve accepting BTC directly

I think the major issue is the inability to purchase many of the things you need day-to-day with bitcoin, especially giving how volatile the currency is relative to USD.
If I'm paid in BTC, I still need dollars to buy my lunch/gas/movie tickets in pretty much every place. So if I get paid in BTC at the beginning of the month when BTC is woth 100$, but by the middle of the month it's 80$, I'll have a serious problem paying for all those things.
That is, until there's a big enough BTC economy to not require any exchanges between it and fiat money, but that's probably a long way away....

But why does it only show BTC/CAD and not BTC/USD?

In the very general sense - it sends a message of instability and insecurity. The knowledge that the major (80-90% ?) exchange can easily go offline for hours is concerning, and many people will quickly drop whatever BTC they have.
That said - with every iteration this affect seems to be weaker an weaker. I believe the initial one was when BTC dropped from 32$ to under 1$. the last one with 250$ -&gt; 50$, and this time we didn't even go under the 100$ line. So people are wising up, realizing that an attack on Gox is not an attack on bitcoin.

I'm pretty sure my BTC got into MtGox with 5...

How feasible is it that large suppliers will accept bitcoin? Or that anyone will receive a paycheck in bitcoins?

A bitcoin would be worth a bitcoin.... since you'll do all trade in bitcoins anyway, and avoid the fringe government fiat.
