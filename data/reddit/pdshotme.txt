Unfortunately the only way to avoid scams is regulation. Until there are rules to prevent scams, there will be scams. The only two options are regulation or theft. Regulation is absolutely necessary for Bitcoin to grow beyond this point.

@_date: 2018-01-17 17:16:48
God you're annoying. You must be brand new to this. Do you not see the pattern of going up 500% then down 30-50% the up another 500%. The only people that panic are the ones that bought high. I'm riding the same wave as you. Am I happy it's dropping 50%, no, but it's still up 20% since 2 months ago and 1000% over the last year.  
Chill the fuck out.

If you've been in BTC at least a year you can always just look at the 1 year chart and see you're still up over 1000% in that time and the dip doesn't bother you at all.

I don't need to watch any more than what I saw when he starts justifying his clout because he's rich. Doesn't matter what was said before that if you're coming with that level of arrogance. Also, there's an entire history of this guy being just as much of a prick in other interviews, including the main post here. 
I honestly didn't really know much about this guy until this week and I'm not even sure what side of the BTC or BCH fence I land on since now I own close to equal values of both. Go listen to people like Andreas Antonopoulos, Charlie Shrem, Charlie Lee, Gavin Andresen, or Tim Draper speak about Bitcoin and Crypto. It's markedly calmer, less ego, more information, less selfishness, more community based than the way Roger Ver's egotistical, flamboyant, bombastic and "LOOK AT ME" way of speaking. He goes by the name "Bitcoin Jesus" for CHRIST'S sake. I mean.... COME ON
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:21:33
That's a lot of words speaking to the politics of this which is precisely what I'm sick of hearing about. I get the personal some of this but in the end that's business. People fight, people have different ideas.... But rather than some with the people I'd like to evaluate each idea.  To your analogy, Bill Gates "forked off" of Apple to create Microsoft so that doesn't really hold water.

Substitute the word debit for credit and the point remains the exact same. There is no card that debits transactions from Bitcoin account's directly. There are cards that debit to exchanges and exchange BTC for fiat for a fee. 
When I use my debit or credit cards I don't pay a fee. There in lies the difference.

Yeah, I get the shady nature of it which I mentioned in my original post where I was asking for some technical arguments against Bcash instead of arguments against Ver
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:50:32
Genuine curiosity, what causes the distain in r/Bitcoin toward BCH. Is it solely about Roger Ver and his shady cohorts? Do people have issues with the technical merits of Bcash? I've not seen many or any arguments about the technical merits that Ver claims about the coin. Everyone just hates *this guy* and seemingly a competitor to Bitcoin. 
I'm sure I'm going to be told I'm some sort of shill here because that's the climate all the sudden but I'm curious because I'm one of the people that had a healthy sum of Bcash deposited into his coinbase account this week and  trying to decide what to do with it. It's hard for me to react to what people are saying here on r/Bitcoin because it's so personal and basically a bunch of ad hominem attacks. 
EDIT- TLDR- Explain why Bitcoin Cash is bad without mentioning the words "Roger Ver" "the real Bitcoin",  "stolen" , "r/bch" ... I don't care about the politics or pissing matches. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:29:39
There are exactly zero Bitcoin credit cards.  I have Shift card. It's not a Bitcoin credit card but rather a card that converts Bitcoin into fiat, requiring transaction fees. As you probably know, fees are through the roof right now. A problem you don't run into with usable currencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:48:48
Yeah, no shit! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:56:40
It's funny how people complain constantly about the idea of Bitcoin being regulated. Then people get angry when rich and powerful people do fucked up shit that looks like cheating on the surface but isn't because there's no regulation. 
News flash- if there's no rule against something and someone can make money doing it, it will be done. Bitcoin needs regulation to survive or it will be sucked dry by the people who are already doing this with fiat currency *with* all sorts of regulation.

I'm sorry for your loss but your brother killed himself because he had mental demons. Many things can set issues like this off whether it's the loss of a lover, job, career, or sometimes financial losses. The underlying cause of your brother killing himself was chemical, happening in his brain. Often times in this country we try to attack the symptom of a problem rather than the cause of the problem.  BTC might have been a catalyst but it didn't kill your brother. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:15:02
Yeah, I see that. What im looking for is someone to argue against the technical merits of the changes made in BCH vs BTC. I've not found that here. 
I don't really care about the politics of any of these coins. In the end the politics aren't going to determine the values, it will be the usability. I've seen many videos of Roger being a total dickhead but I have not seen many people take aim at the things he claims about scaling up, transaction times, and fees.

"if the price wants to shoot up or plummet"...
Prices don't have free will, wants or desires. Prices are reflections of humans reacting to news, making them buy or sell. It's still news of some sort that humans are receiving that's causing the price to go up and down.

Still wrong. If someone said "Bob literally said..." than whatever you are about to say next should be word for word what Bob said. Literally is being applied to the words "said" not the meaning.

Incorrect. It's bad news right now because many companies were in the middle of debating whether or not they should accept Bitcoin. They are probably going to pass on it now and it won't be up for discussion in these companies for a long time. Lets hope that wasn't Amazon, Google, Netflix or any of the other rumored big companies.
At some point for Bitcoin to flourish there needs to be an extended period of time without a flash crash. Every time the price fluctuates down 50%+ that's going to scare companies and big investors away. This issue might get fixed but that doesn't mean it fixes the collateral damage.

It's not about the price fall for me. It's about the overall confidence now that the microscope is on Bitcoin. It can only take so many massive hits that everyone seems to think are "actually good news". I  wonder how many companies were in the process of considering accepting Bitcoin just before this happened. When they scrap the plan they don't revisit it in 3 weeks when everything is "all better". Companies that have already decided to accept Bitcoin won't keep riding this roller coaster. Price is a determination of consumer confidence, it's not decided out of thin air.
Confidence is heading toward an all time low in this new era of Bitcoin where the world is watching and making decisions.

The problem with financial disasters is they are compounding and exponential. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 02:22:33
Actually, it doesn't represent any increase. It just represents 4% of average sales. Given that January through March are typically VERY slow months for retail sales (with January being the slowest month) I'd venture to bet that it was far higher than 4% of yesterday's sales. Also, just because it is 4% of sales doesn't mean it's a 4% increase in sales. Sure, a certain percentage of those sales were an increase but anyone who was already a customer or was planning on buying from Overstock and just happened to pay with Bitcoin shouldn't be included as "an increase".

Uhhhh. I'm not sure if you are serious or not but you tell me which is more utility 22 Bitcoins or 0.38 .... Also,  if you look at the article you would have seen that this happened when they were worth $1,100 a coin. So $1,100 x 22 vs $400 x 0.38 which has greater utility?
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:08:53
It's not a disaster but it's bordering on it. I'm not new here. I've been here long enough to know that the last time these flash crashes happened Bitcoin wasn't under the watch of the mainstream eye. Major companies weren't on the verge of considering taking Bitcoin as payment. 
Things are different now. Every time things like this happen now it's exponentially worse than the last time it happened. So while the  previous crashes like Feb 2012 or a few times during 2013 might have done more damage to the overall price, this dive is causing a significant amount more collateral damage. 
EDIT- Don't try to patronize people with the phrase "you must be new here". Most of the people I see saying that are a lot of talk but don't really understand what they are saying. Most of the most experienced Bitcoiners never utter the phrase. Using the phrase is like wearing a scarlet letter.

No bank is giving any home loans if you only have $800 and no assets. Secondly, looking at your transactions via WF alone says nothing about what BTC you actually own. I could route all of my paychecks to buy BTC on Coinbase then spend my BTC. At the end of the year it might show that I bought 60 BTC but it doesn't mean I'm still holding 60 BTC.

That absolutely isn't how Bitcoin trading works. The point you're making in theory works for commodities but not in reality and certainly not for a currency. The only part of what you said  that makes sense is baked into the supply/demand curve.
Bitcoin is a currency that can act as a commodity. Longer term investors treat it more like gold, holding as it appreciates. But there are constant transactions of it being used as a currency as well. Over time it's used more as a currency than a commodity, less people holding it, more people using it daily. 
You can pretty much eliminate the investors/holders from the equation. They are freezing part of the supply as well as the demand. 
The value increases as more people want Bitcoin to use as a currency (increasing demand) faster than the supply grows (people selling coins/mined coins entering the market). Since mining is based on transactions the supply of new coins won't outpace the rate they are being demanded. So that only leaves one way for coins to appreciate in value..... People have to flood the market with demand, aka injecting money into Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:04:15
It absolutely is. The difference between stocks and currencies is value can be added by potential or perceived value. Currencies are always accurately valued based on transactions. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:12:12
The climb wouldn't have been as steep either.. In general, margin creates volatility with higher highs and lower lows for traders but shouldn't have much effect on the overall asset's value for investors.

@_date: 2017-08-15 04:34:25
Actually that's exactly how trading a currency works. The only way for it to increase in value is to increase its demand faster than its supply relative to the currency you're comparing it against. I'm assuming we're using USD for this conversation. If one BTC is worth $4000 USD then for BTC to increase in value its demand vs USD needs to increase, meaning people have to shift money out of USD and "inject" it into BTC. 
That or USD just needs to crash.

I don't know how you use it but to me Bitcoin is most definitely a currency, my main currency. I put my entire paycheck (minus other investments) into my Bitcoin account and spend it as I would cash using this card... 
Everything I spend is essentially discounted as Bitcoin appreciates, saving me thousands over the years. Everything I don't spend is saved in my Bitcoin account, just held, growing by the day at an interest rate astronomically higher than anywhere else I could put my money other than semiconductor stocks (highly recommend SOXL and UCTT btw). Anywhere Visa is accepted I can spend my Bitcoin. Tell me how this isn't a currency the way I use it?

You dorealize when you pay for anything with a card you're just tapping into some digital store of value that is input as dollars and exits as dollars and in between is nothing more than code storing the value. Do you think there are actual dollars sitting somewhere that are yours? All currency beyond actual cash is some digital store of value that is converted into whatever currency you pay with. If I buy something in Yen with my visa my digital store of value converts to yen to pay whoever I'm paying. You store your value in whatever currency  you want. It's the basic principal of international banking and forex.

Hate to break it to you but that's exactly how your dollars currently work as well. Fiat currency has a store of value and once it's converted to 1's and 0's it's just sitting there waiting to be converted back into dollars once transactions happen. Whatever value the dollar is when you convert back is what gets pulled. More similar to Venmo or Paypal balances. Just digital currency that get converted back to dollars but currencies no less. 
Not if I'm swiping my card. The point of sale transaction happens the moment I swipe and the value of the currency in that moment is the cost I pay. I don't need to sell, that's on Shift. When I swipe my card it's an instantaneous transaction on my end that goes into a ledger on Shift's end of when I made the transaction and the value of BTC in that moment. Sometimes, like last night, when the value shoots up unexpectedly I'll use my card to buy any big ticket items or pay any debts/bills I owe for the month before the value corrects a bit a few hours later. 
You're speaking to a broader scope of people but if you choose to use it as a currency the absolute option is there. It's a currency if you want it to be. I 100% use it as a currency and have for years. If it can be used as a currency, it is. End of story. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:34:09
What's the difference between me and "most people"? Just because most people aren't doing it doesn't mean it's not there as an option. Most people don't eat eggplant but eggplant is still a food. I'm not different than anyone else I just choose to use it as a currency and I do. It's a currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:47:31
I pay my rent using my shift card. If you can pay tax liabilities using a Visa card then then you've got no problem using BTC. I could get my employer to deposit my money in BTC (I'm a partner in my company with the other partners also heavily invested into the use of BTC so that's a bit of a different story). I choose to accept the money into my bank account as USD and convert when I want rather than a direct deposit that could hit at a peak. 
You're talking about risk like fiat has no risk. You're talking about BTC like it's unusable as a currency. I use it 100% as a currency, therefore it is one.

I think you were missing my point. Sure, I'll fake the week to understand what's going on but the masses of society will never take the time. Nor would devoting a single week to studying bitcoins do most people any good. I just Dont see this as being something that's for everyone like many people around here believe. The way many people in this subreddit talk they act as if bitcoins are being handed down directly from god with all the freedom and choice to start utopia on earth. Right now its a great investment opportunity and it will grow larger making it a nice place to store money. But once that surge from speculators dies down what will remain? The demand for BTC is being completely driven by speculators. I suspect the people driving BTC demand for its intended use are likely people who cannot risk performing traceable transactions. Until this currency can drive demand as a widely accepted and used currency by everyday joes, its just a bubble waiting to burst. I'm willing to ride the bubble and educate myself enough to do so.

When I hear this type of technological jargon being thrown around I feel less and less certain that cryptocurrency will ever be something the average Joe will ever partake in. If it isn't something everyday people will be able to do, it's doomed to fail. I'm getting the feeling the entire market is nothing but speculators and criminals. It would take me an entire week to fully understand what you just said, and yet, it seems as though it's vitally important that I understand it if I want to get involved in BTC beyond my current level. I consider myself a fairly technologically savvy guy, knowing far more about the world of technology and computing than 95% of my peers and yet so much of this Bitcoin world is so far over my head. How can the hopeful speculators truly expect this will be something that average people will adopt? Sure, get in while the going is good. It's California in 1849 all over again "mining for gold". But frankly, I feel like the guy's selling shovels will be the ones walking away with the biggest pile of cash in the end. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:31:57
It's highly unlikely that with a market cap of over $8bil that one investor's trade of *some* of his coins could possibly send BTC down 33% of it's value. Right now half the sites that sell coins are flooded with orders and can't seem to get their hands on coins. Coinbase is taking orders today that won't be processed until Friday, at Friday's price. Cashintocoins.com usually quotes 30 minute process times pushed their times to 6 hours then completely stopped taking orders saying they were backed up for 2 days. 
When a market moves like it did for the past week and more specifically the last 24 hours people start doing crazy things. The most likely and notable crazy thing that people do is invest money they shouldn't be risking. Savings, pulling from other investments, next month's mortgage/rent/bill money etc. The go *all in* while the going is good but they know they can't really risk that money so at the first little sign of any downturn they pull out that "unriskable" money. That run up was a mini bubble caused by a perfect storm of good news, the word getting out about BTC and a huge spike already taking place. The mini bubble burst causing a correction because people didn't want to be *all in* anymore, just halfway in. 
There might be some guy in Seattle who unloaded a ton of coins but this thing is far too big for one person to driving the price.

No 1% wouldn't make a significant difference. If 1% of all Bitcoins were to disappear right now (currently 12,000,000 down to 11,880,000)it would take the value from $950 to $959.

The one that I am curiously watching is Dogecoin. It seems like it was started as a joke, sort of a circlejerk to Bitcoin but all the sudden it's gained a lot of steam. Last I looked it was already up to  on the list of coins by market cap. It definitely wouldn't be the first "joke" on reddit that turned into a real thing. The power of reddit is strong. I do think it will just come and go and be forgotten but I've got my eye on it anyway. I've thought about pumping a few bucks in there, like you said, just in case.

Nobody is telling you not to. In fact, nobody is even specifically talking to you. I was making a general point which you seem to have taken so personally as if I killed all your hopes and dreams. It's like a small dose of reality jumped up and slapped you across the face and now you are trying to take your revenge. Many people in this subreddit are exhibiting all the typical [social psychological factors]( that lead to wild bubbles of speculation. Yes, there will be money made and it's being made now. But like all "too good to be true" bubbles, the ride comes to an end eventually. All I'm saying is that the factor that will eventually end the ride I predict will be lack of security for the average user without a degree in computer science. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 07:57:32
Let's be honest here, what's driving this currency is two things... 1) The ability for criminal enterprises to make untraceable transactions which might be hacking into accounts and stealing Bitcoins or just buying and selling stolen/illegal goods digitally without getting caught. 2) Speculators that see an arbitrage opportunity.
The criminal wants to see the speculators succeed because it opens the door to more and more opportunities to "do business" and the speculator is fairly accepting of the criminal because the criminal activity helps drive demand and inflate the price of the currency. 
I'll be honest, i'm here for the investment opportunity. There's money to be made. But once that well dries up, I don't see myself dealing in Bitcoins on a day to day basis. This entire thing is wrapped in this heartwarming story of "Freedom and dreams", give me a break. It's all about the money one way or another.

In 10 years there will be about 19mil coins making the value $37,000 based on your math. However, I think taking over 25% of credit card transactions is a bit overzealous and gold is rather irrelevant in this.
The way I always think about it is like this.. There is an equivalent value of approx $22 trillion of all currencies in the world combined (value denominated in USD of course). For every 1% of the overall currency market BTC captures it takes BTC's market cap up approx $220 billion. Divide that by the number of coins that are in circulation and you get your overall value. Lets assume that in 10 years BTC can capture 1% of the world's currency each Bitcoin would be worth approx $11,500. 
Another thing to consider in this equation is that some Bitcoins are lost forever. In 10 years there will be 19 million coins in circulation but a certain number of coins will be gone from the market all together from misplaced coins, coins sent to the wrong address, inside a locked wallet with no way of recovering, people dying with the next of kin never knowing about the Bitcoins etc.. I would assume there will be a way of estimating how many Bitcoins are lost each year by then which will drive the price of each coin up as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:25:07

Digital currency now that it's here won't pass by as a fad. There is a genuine use for it just as there was for the internet. I suppose something could knock Bitcoin off the perch as top dog like how Myspace crashed and burned while Facebook took over the world but just like the internet or social media, cryptocurrency is here to stay. It isn't a fad. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:38:24
Yep.. I agree. Just like there are multiple government regulated currencies I think there will be multiple cryptocurrencies. I think Bitcoin is definitely  and will remain  but as Bitcoin goes mainstream places that take Bitcoin might start taking one altcoin as well. Right now that would look like Litecoin but that being said I think we are still a few years off from mainstream Bitcoin acceptance. Whatever coin has the second largest market cap at that time will probably be the alt coin that makes it. Beyond that I think these coins will exist but not ever become useful. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:54:42
The entire point I am debating his point that Bitcoin was a fad, aka not here to stay. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:42:55
I also think part of it is older investors have seen so many fly-by-night "cant miss" investment opportunities pop up and disappear just as quickly that anything something new comes around they are reluctant to try it or even try to understand it until they know it is here to stay. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 07:19:43
SO... MUCH...BUTTHURT... 
Relax. 
A- It wasn't the same people saying that about the internet. What some people were saying about the internet in the beginning however was that it was a giant swelling [economic bubble]( just waiting to burst. Just like now, there were people then that were saying "This bubble ain't never burstin'" ... .
B- Everything that is considered good about Bitcoin is also what makes it bad. To have the true safety, you have to get rid of the anonymity. If you get rid of the anonymity it loses it's inherent value. 
C- Early adopters are playing a high risk, high reward wild west style investment game which is just about the only thing that makes it enticing. Take away the reward factor (which can't be had without the risk) and you just have another currency, just like gold, the USD or EUR. I don't see soccer moms, and good ole boy dads lining up to exchange their native currency in the current FX market. The people doing this are speculators. Once the speculation is gone, the lights will come up and the curtain will close. Yes, a lot of money has been made. Yes, more will be made. But is this a currency that the entire world will adopt on a daily basis by Average Joe in mom and pop shops? Naaaahh.. Not even close.

@_date: 2013-11-20 09:26:48
I had to just stop reading at "speculation has created a massive bubble that will burst" ... A bubble is only created when the value of something is artificially inflated by speculative demand exceeding intrinsic value. 
An international currency with inexpensive transactions that can happen immediately most definitely has intrinsic value. 
If all the currency in the world were converted to USD right now it would be close to $22 trillion. Lets assume that Bitcoin is only ever able to tap into 1% of that total. That would mean the equivalent of $220 billion (USD) would be funneled into Bitcoin. Granted there will only ever be (long after we are dead and gone) 21 million total coins that would mean each coin would be worth roughly $10,400. 
I actually believe we will see more than 1% of the total world currency go into Bitcoins in our lifetime and we will never live to see all 21 million coins mined meaning in our lifetime we *should* see Bitcoin go over this $10,000 mark. As crazy as that seems now, the math behind it makes perfect sense. 
Eventually there will be a bubble and along the way to that bubble there will be spikes and corrections but we are absolutely nowhere near that bubble yet. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere anytime soon. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:59:45

It's hard to be knowledgeable about something that hasn't existed and is virtually unknown. If she didn't know what the internet was now that would be one thing but not knowing in 1994 is about par for the course. 1994 I was 13 and was fairly up on current and future technology.  A friend down the road had Prodigy and he was the only person I knew for years that had access to the internet. When I graduated high school in 1999 there were a few computers in the library that could connect to the internet. By then I had an AOL account, which was all the rage and Ebay was starting to become known. I knew how to play online games (like chess and trivia) and I knew all the lingo in chatrooms. In 1994 most people didn't know anything about the internet. Unless you were some sort of computer scientist the only thing you might have known about the internet was it was being dubbed as "the next big thing" and the phrase "Information superhighway" was thrown around a lot. I remember Time magazine came out with an issue that said on the cover "How to Use the Internet" and I feel like everything exploded right after that.

What is this bitcointip? I see it all over the place now?

So you've been told that you will receive your coins on December 2nd and you came here to ask when you will get your coins?  Not to mention you could have used [THIS]( instead of making a new post

At this point though, if you owned bitcoins would buy things with them? Seems like the worst way to spend $400 for a toaster.

Except you need the US to adopt bitcoin to drive up demand. We all do.... Just not yet!

I am in the exact same boat now a month into trying to buy. I made my first purchase on Coinbase 2 weeks ago and after waiting a week for the coins the transaction was canceled by my bank because they deemed it to be suspicious activity. I dumped that bank and went to another, waited another week to get my account verified then bought. It's been a week since I bought, supposed to get my coins tomorrow. I've been sitting on the sidelines with cash in hand wanting to buy... I've seen the price go from $210 to now close to $700 trying to make my first purchase. So fucking frustrating.

Again proving the point that currency trading/for ex has as much to do with psychology as it does numbers.

I expect this type of behavior out of members of the House. But this is the Senate. He's a fucking SENATOR!! Not only is he a Senator, he's the Senator of Illinois, where the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is.

No, it's still fraud. You just get away with it. If you murder someone and don't get caught you still committed murder. With all due respect you sir are an idiot.
