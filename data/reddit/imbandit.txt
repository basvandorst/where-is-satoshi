Thank you for saying this. Autistic people absolutely aren't stupid, and there's no reason we should be talking trash about them.

Hmmmm...because there's no drama on I don't even hold any BCH and sometimes the mentality here disgusts me.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:27:15
I'm happy bitcoin cash exists. I don't hold any of it, but seems to me that alternatives are good
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:33:32
Never mind that I can actually use it today for about 1 penny. Obviously that's not relevant
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:34:35
You're being very patient. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:33:37
yes, but what if you want to buy coffee from a store that you'll probably never go back to.  You still have to pay the $20 fucking transaction fee to open a channel.  
Or you need to have a small number of highly centralized hubs that everyone uses for channels, and if the currency actually functioning is contingent upon those hubs, it almost begins to beg the question why have a decentralized currency at all?

Perhaps it's worth considering it a "lack of connection" between the miners and the developers(instead of lack of education). When you don't have trust/understanding /shared language/personal connections to go off of, anyone's intentions can be easily mistaken. Add an element of escalation to that, and things could get out of hand pretty quick :P  
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:37:04
I think this is true under the assumption that bitcoin as a network grows substantially in pair with Lightning Network.  What would it look like for miners if Lightning Network was running right this moment, with the same amount of bitcoin usage that has been going on. I suspect that they'd be making quite a bit less.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:55:25
I can't help but think maybe there is some cultural landscape interfering with things here still. As far as I see it, Jihan posted something that was deeply honest (even if he didn't write it).  He exposed his own desires/motivations.  Yes, one of those motivations is continuing to have a economic place in bitcoin.  The fact that he is leveling with us is huge.  Perhaps you could encourage your own Corporation to speak more of it's own true situation.
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:38:52


Good point. Blockstream is what I was referring to.


What I mean is both the body of miners that this post is "speaking for", and Blockstream are subject to economic pressure and both are in position with very strong possibility for their viewpoint being influenced by their own incentives. The miners are starting to talk about it openly, acknowledging that it is a conflict of interest.
I haven't heard blockstream mention the fact that they have powerful investors who are would really like to see a return on their investment. I haven't even heard them bring it up into public discussion. You can bet it's a central pillar of discussion inside the company, and yet they continue to pretend that it doesn't exist or at least abstain from discussing it publicly.
How can you have a group that is radically transparent when they can't even tell you what the goal of their business model is?
*edited for formatting*
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:09:03
^ This!! I can't believe this isn't being discussed more. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:39:35
^ THIS!!!  I even support core mostly.  I totally appreciate Jihan's Open approach to talking about the heart of the matter. I would greatly appreciate Core stepping up to his level of public integrity here.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:40:08
It's always worth investing small amounts if you intend to hold for four+ years. This spring I told my mother not to buy in at a thousand because i thought it wasn't a good time to buy. You just never know.
But buying small amounts over a period of time and holding is always a winning game

There are countless ways. First is the distinction if you want to cash out through a financial institution or through a regular human. 
* If you want less of a paper trail use localbitcoins.com to find someone to trade with.... Either in person or through online bank systems.
* If you want to use an established financial institution... Sign up for one of the dozens of bitcoin exchanges in the world. Depends which country you're in... But if you're in the states, I would recommend Gemini. Otherwise Google bitcoin exchange. It hooks up to your bank account... You sell bitcoin, money arrives 3 business days later
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:37:05
Yes. Indian culture is that different. Everyone loves Bollywood. Men sing and dance, then they go kill each other. 
Also men touching each other in public, ie hugs, hand holding, etc is super common.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:34:34
You can buy anything on Amazon.com via purse.io with discounts from five to forty percent. 
If a shop doesn't accept it there are multiple bitcoin debit card issuers, where you can spend your bitcoin anywhere with a debit card. 
Also you can just sell it on localbitcoins.com for cash or bank transfers. 
So it's actually stupidly easy to use, even if the people you want to transact with don't know anything about it yet.

@_date: 2017-08-14 14:53:09
Bitcoin is a drop in the bucket compared to modern financial systems. You haven't seen anything yet. The key...
* Only invest what you feel comfortable losing
* Buy in with small increments over a period of time
* Forget about it for at least four years
That last one is way harder then it seems. Good luck
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:37:55
Bitcoin is exceptionally rare. Twenty one million bitcoins will ever exist... But many have been lost, so no more then 21 million. That means that one bitcoin is as rare as 19 lbs of pure gold. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:45:20
Nobody uses gold because clipping .1356 grams of gold off your coin and weighing it at the gas station is a massive waste of everyone's time...
But for thousands of years, that was the norm... Minus the gas station of course.
Also, people aren't rational. I love spending bitcoin, given the option, I will spend bitcoin every time because it's awesome and I love it.

Yeah, thats good advice.  36k isn't quite nothing to me, it's certainly more money then I spend in a year.  And yeah, exchanges are definitely better I think..
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:33:46
A) Would you prefer I held the bitcoin cash?  We've all had to deal with it one way or another, I was selling it. Point remains that Changelly has a bunch of my money and they're not making any effort to get it back to me.
B) No, it was definitely BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:14:34

@_date: 2017-11-16 23:36:19

Hey NewYorker!
Thanks for the co-miseration! Yeah, it's a strange and sometimes painful world. I remember once thinking that somebody stole something out of my house, it was very traumatic, turns out thankfully it had fallen into a tight place, but god darn if the whole experience didn't shake me to core.  
I'll help you get started again, send me your BTC address.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:05:32
Maybe, wouldn't surprise me.  Doesn't explain why it's taken two days to respond to fucking support request though.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:06:30
I already sent you a refund address.  Sent it again. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:51:28

@_date: 2015-07-29 16:36:19
wow!!! so beautiful =)  i love it  $5
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:06:56
Nope, I sent them the refund address in my support request.  But no, I've heard nothing from them.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:45:49
I know it's not bitcoin, but I figured this would get Changelly's attention faster on and I don't really hang out at anyhow.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:04:45
no, the problem is that Changelly either had a problem with their software or they willfully batch canceled a bunch of transactions to save money, and now they aren't communicating or getting around to refunding me, causing me to keep losing thousands of dollars as the price of BCH falls.
There was no confusion about BCH / BTC here, I was selling BCH for Lisk.  I posted on because I'm not really a huge fan of @_date: 2017-11-16 21:34:32

@_date: 2016-09-16 13:28:56
Usaa is super bitcoin friendly, they even invested a big chunk of money into bitcoin companies. All online, free atms anywhere, actually integrate with coinbase...
Also, they are incredibly not nosy. And the customer support is phenomenal. And you can use ups stores kind of like a teller for certain things you might want a brick and mortar location for
@_date: 2017-09-28 02:47:59
I'm fine with that.  I'm still going to choose to support decentralized currency rather then put my money in blood backed US petrodollars.

I must say, I thought it was pretty tastefully describing the middle ground in the whole situation.
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:10:37
It's worth noting that his reply is stringently one dimensional. Some might say Ver was trying to save bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-05-24 13:00:10
God! That statement feels so appropriate. What weird time we live in
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:58:24
Wow.... I'm a total core supporter, and that's just about the stupidest argument I've ever heard. 
"Choose the status quo". 
Fuck. Because the status quo has been working so well I'm everything else in life.
So what happens if you apply that argument to someone who doesn't is maybe thinking about how they want to bank, or invest. Choose the status quo. Welp, that sure as shit isn't bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:02:59
Why am I getting the feeling that most of what you're saying is nothing more then thinly veiled ad hominems against "the other". It's days like this that make me sad about how bitcoin is turning out. We used to be a revolution, now...i don't know... But things have changed
@_date: 2017-05-21 04:10:44
I think the majority of the pushback against segwit is actually pushback against the people and the ways behind it. Not necessarily against segwit, but especially against how it's been done. 
This whole space is so weird to be apart of. Does anyone else find it strange that we built a money system that was supposed to be a-political. And our whole community has split into vehemently opposed factions.
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:55:08
There is no truth.

Seems like a poke to me.
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:53:54
What about small costs to creating a user, and small cost to leaving a review. 
If you took a half a percent of the purchase value for instance, and automatically tied it up in a review somehow. It would be coming from the sellers pocket, so users wouldn't be disincentized to leave a review... But there might be considerable cost to "building your own reputation ecosystem" apart from others. 
* This is just some threads of an idea, obviously not fully fleshed out* 
Maybe the amount of money tied up in reviews would also serve as an indicator of trust.
I'm not sure where the money would go, whether it's burnt, or if it could have a feasible output.

People don't just hold it. Speculators and people purely in it to "get rich" hold it. 
Lots of people are using it to, just not the normative populace. There are millions and millions of usd in bitcoin flowing through the dark net at all times. Thousands of small illicit businesses require it to function.
Also, many bitcoin revolutionaries spend it all the time. I will *always* spend bitcoin over my usd. I probably spend bitcoin every day. I go out of my way to frequent businesses where i can spend bitcoin.

right, there is no reason you can't purchase .0005 of a bitcoin, but who wants to own .0005 of anything??  there is a definite psychological barrier to it, it's LESS then 1.  
1 is the loneliest of numbers, if you have LESS then 1, it's just embaressing.  I think this is a really important issue actually.

Hey OP, I'm sure you understand that bitcoin is already volatile as a currency.  Getting over that hump, here is my best answer to your question.  The two best investments I have at the moment are AsicMiner-PT and RTM in the Bitfunder platform.  (Stocks).  They are both mining companies...they both seem very reliable, honest, and transparent.  RTM pays out dividends on a daily basis. AM on a weekly basis.  Using the last month's worth of dividends for calculation at buy current prices, AM pays out annual 110.76% in dividends, and RTM pays out 94.12% in dividends.  Obviously the difficulty of mining will increase over time, and who the hell knows what will happen with these companies or with bitcoin.  Also disclaimer, I own about 150 btc of combined shared in these two companies.  So your purchasing will increase the value of my holdings.

I encourage you to do your own research.  But this is an honest go at answering your question.
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:08:05
Hi Greg!  Man, I can't imagine the amount of different discussions and thoughts you are juggling at the moment. You probably deserve a very long vacation that likely isn't coming. I, for one, wouldn't be able to handle the amount of processing and making sense of everything that's on your plate right now. And that's just in the social sense, much less in the technical sense, which is also a lot. 
You were one of the first people I ever felt really inspired me to think about bitcoin. I watched a video of you talking about the blockchain years ago, and it fired me up. Ive always wanted to meet you. A friend of mine works pretty closely with you these days I believe. I'm kind of jealous of him! At any rate, many of us don't have the time, energy, and predisposition to see the technical system in the way that you are able to. 
At the same time, there are so many different actors in the crypto sphere, and many of us don't really know each other as people. In a very real way, you hold special access to a system that is very dear to all of us. In many instances, it's through your words that we are able to get a glimpse of what that system actually is. You're kind of a modern techno-priest. The fellow above, whatever his methods, is experiencing some fear that maybe your stance is affected by your obligations to your immediate community of all of the people who are involved with Blockstream, whether they're hacking code, herding cats, strategizing about the future, or paying everyone's salaries. 
I want to ask you if you could speak to that for a moment. Is there pressure within Blockstream to turn a profit? Is lightning network going to help keep Blockstream alive? Does Blockstream need lightning network? 
I sincerely hope we get there, to lighting network, Greg, regardless. There is a lot of fear in the sphere Greg... We're all afraid of each other =(

How would you know if it wasn't? 
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:28:41
Fine.  But never the less...
1. The entire value of the ripple concept is in widespread adoption.
2. Now it's being developed bya serious and well funded organization, who will be more successful at promoting it's usage then Ryan Fugger ever was.
3. It will be publicly available, and the barrier to entry for everyday use will be practically non existent.
So who the fuck cares if people scramble to buy up XRPs.  It won't matter.  If you don't like them, you STILL get a group of capable funded people spreading Ripple across the world, and for the price of a couple of dollars, you will be able to utilize their network for your ENTIRE life.

^this.  I don't have a problem with OpenCoin.  Their system is incredibly powerful and if it gains widespread adoption could completely rewrite history.  XRP is barely a footnote.

it really has nothing to do with ripple or bitcoin.  It's way more like paypal to be honest...Google probably would have been smart to do this in 2008.  Paypal allowed you to send money to email addresses since day one

Guess it's an old fashioned bank run

What's a 502 mean for nginx?  I figured it's just overloaded.  Does it mean something else?

They are in very early level of this.  They are going to target existing large networks, and distribute enough XRP for those systems to enlist their existing users.  
Facebook, SevenEleven, Banks, etc...
But they need a successful proving ground first, and that's where this community comes in.  It's not within their interest to hoard them, if their system doesn't gain global mass, their holdings are worthless.

Send them a request!!!  Uber is a perfect example of technological innovation disrupting old stagnant industries.  They've already built a better taxi system (UberX).  And it's positioned to grow immensely.  Their payment systems are all automatic, done online.  Lets get them to accept bitcoin!  
They would be perfect, if Uber started accepting bitcoin, then you could book independent local taxis nearly anywhere in the world for bitcoin!!!

I think you've hit the real crux of angry bitcoiners here...
@_date: 2013-05-17 17:32:37
Well, if you could increase your bitcoin holdings by 50% in one year.  Would that be worth it for you?  You still have to deal with the risk of the value of bitcoin...but assuming that the value goes up, a well placed investment would compound your profit over and above just holding on to the currency.  (more risk, taking on the liability of the company you are investing in...but possibility of more gain)

seems to be missing any concrete support...I would summarize the author like thus.... "people will never spend bitcoin and it will crumble and die terribly,  thankyou"
