I went onto eBay. I specifically searched for people in Greece and bought a lot of 25 drachmas 83% silver.
It was a tad overpriced above spot but I'd like to I helped someone over there. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 18:25:28
And what if metals are banned? Btc on a few paper wallets are a lot easier to hide and even transport.

Wow never heard of Circle.  I'm getting an error screen confirming my email.


We are currently unable to verify the type of device or browser you are using. We check this in order to provide better security for your Circle account.
Please try accessing Circle from another device or browser. If the problem persists, please contact support for additional help.
Is it because I'm on the internet with a network adapter?

I tried selling a camera on eBay. The buyer did a buy it now option and instantly started to text me on my phone to give him my paypal email. I told him it was linked to ebay and that I will assume this is a scam if not done thru eBay listing. 
After awhile of not getting paid I assume it was a scam and ignored it. About a month later eBay hit me with close to 100 bucks in fees for the listing (right after I got a email from eBay telling me it's a possible scam account). 
Thanks eBay.

Is it ok to try and contact the seller before the 4 days is up. All that the moderator person does is cancel the trade when in reality I really want it to happen. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 01:55:51
I had some good experiences with bitsquare but my last two attempted buys seemed to be duds.
I am using clearxchange but whenever I add the seller to the clearxchange list I get 
*"Sorry, at this time, this recipient’s bank does not enable its customers to receive person-to-person payments from the clearXchange service. You can add a different recipient, or select Cancel to return to the prior screen."*
Seems like they change their info before I put it in.  Last time this happened the seller has their email and I was unable to sent funds.  I accepted another offer they had which listed their cell number.  
This has been happening another and its been making me wary with bitsquare.

Upstate ny here. 
I shouldn't have to move but our safe act is pretty bad here too. So seems like it's getting worse. 
I use circle, btce, and bittrex. I haven't gotten a single notice to gtfo yet. 
I didn't even know this licensing debacle passed.

Me too. First the safe act now this.

That's understandable. Not everyone have the time or resources  to study. 
What do you do with the ones that say "I don't care"?
I continuously hear that on my end.
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:24:13
He's probably fed up. He probably tried to help as much people as possible by trying to inform them. Most, if not all probably said "I don't care". Some may even be his own family. 
It gets tiring sometimes even soul crushing. I've been there. I enjoy talking about this sort of thing but I usually get blue in the face trying to make sense of it to others. 
I've accepted a lot of people will be burnt. I've not only tried to explain the situation but I bought the ones I care about silver (which I think they lost) and offered them some BTC too. 
It's wrong to rub another's misfortune in their face. But at some point you have to walk away and let them deal with their own choices.

FDIC insurance only holds a couple billion while there are trillions in the banking system. There will be a lot of pissed off people. 
It's now considered that people are no longer depositors they are now investors in the bank. So if the bank fails they face losses. Pretty much meaning a possible haircut in their accounts. It's in the fine print now.

Not much had changed since 2008 tbh.

The free market could do better. I could argue that the cost of schools and hospitals are mainly a fact of government regulation.  Over a trillion dollars of student loan debt that is delinquent. Thats mainly due to one of the reasons for gov loans, free money for students and schools see this and raise the prices accordingly.

Right, I hope people here have stacked some kind of physical before playing around with btc.  But I doubt it.
But if you keep up with people like peter schiff he made one video about the crazy oil prices.  Yet they were only crazy when priced in dollars.  When priced in goldgrams it was actually pretty stable.
