If bitcoins' price &amp; transaction volume stays at the current levels from now on, then at some future point mining won't be profitable meaning blockchain will be less &amp; less secure meaning protocol becomes vulnerable to 51% attack meaning use of bitcoin through colored coin is not secure. Therefore, bitcoins' use as colored coins will require sustaining the miners incentive to adequately secure the blockchain forever which means once the block reward becomes low enough, the miners fee should be sufficient to keep the miners interested in continuing to secure the blockchain which would require much higher price levels &amp; a higher transaction volume. This means that bitcoin necessarily has to become a viable currency for it to function as a reliable method of transferring &amp; tracking other assets via colored coins in the long term.

User adoption is the only thing that will take care of the long term miner incentive problem &amp; there is sufficient time before the block rewards run out to increase adoption to levels that sustain the miners incentive. Also, anyone who has plans to utilize colored coins on the bitcoin blockchain for the long haul has an incentive to ensure adequate long term security of the network before using it.

20 to 40 yrs is way too long. Bitcoin should be huge or dead within the next 5 yrs as it is just an internet application, so no need to lay cables, servers etc. as opposed to the internet. Also network effect of money will be the greatest &amp; the current technological &amp; macro level environment are extremely favorable towards Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-10 12:12:31
The current liquidity &amp; price level is too low to support low cost remittances. For bitcoin to become widespread as a means for remittances, it will need much higher liquidity, possibly a market cap of $50 billion or more, well on its way towards moon. Once it becomes successful in remittances, there is no stopping it. The network effect of money kicks in, which means that the bigger bitcoin becomes, even bigger is its future expected growth. It will experience exponential growth all the way to the moon. On the other hand, if an as yet undiscovered flaw in the core protocol (if such a thing even exists) is exploited by some hacker to render the technology unusable, then this will cause collapse in confidence &amp; the price will go towards 0. As far as online gambling is concerned, it is already a success as evidenced by large number of transactions to gambling sites. Hence, only 2 possible outcomes for bitcoin in my view. The timing of either one is debatable. But this should play out in the next 5 to 10 years.

The potential for bitcoin is huge in a country like India that is a major receiver of international remittances. But I think most Indians have a very risk averse &amp; orthodox mindset that anything new tends to scare them, more so when dealing with money. The government &amp; law enforcement bodies are corrupted control freaks oblivious to this new technology. Hard to see bitcoin gaining traction in such an environment unless a serious effort to spread awareness &amp; educate the masses about this technology is undertaken. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 15:20:10
OK. How about Bitcoin achieving its fullest potential = 2.5 billion people in the world supporting themselves by earning in bitcoin &amp; consuming &amp; investing using bitcoin.

So, there is a long way to go towards achieving its fullest potential from its present state.
@_date: 2014-12-20 06:50:02

Huge chunk of that $35 billion is fees..right. If bitcoin markets gain sufficient liquidity, it should be able to substantially lower it. Not to mention the other advantages of bitcoin such as no need to wait 3-4 business days, available 24x7 etc. That being said, Andreas either exaggerated the number or misspoke but that doesn't change the fact that remittances are clearly in bitcoin's crosshairs along with many other financial services business models. Still love Andreas though for the sheer passion.

My 2 satoshis at this:
Bitcoin is a decentralized peer to peer internet protocol that allows you to transfer digital tokens known as bitcoins to a recipient anywhere in the world, effectively functioning as money over internet without the need for third parties like banks, just like bittorrent functions as file sharing over internet without the need for centralized servers. The supply of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million which are generated over time through a process called mining. It can be seen as a hybrid of gold &amp; cash tailor made for the internet &amp; offers faster &amp; cheaper transactions than traditional money transfers.

These regulations, while they can have short term impact, are meaningless in the long term.

In that sense, the regulators are sowing the seeds of their own disruption.
@_date: 2014-12-16 10:57:28
Don't worry about the price unless you're a serious trader. The technology works like a charm regardless of the price. A small amount of money that one can afford to lose should definitely be allocated to bitcoins in a well diversified portfolio. Take advantage of drops in price to accumulate it &amp; be thankful that such an asset class has been made available to the pubic by a stranger going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin's success or failure can only be known after at least 4 to 5 years have passed not in the next hour or so.

@_date: 2014-12-03 15:59:59
There are 2 points here:
1. Creating conduits to facilitate remittances would mean using bitcoin technology only as a payment mechanism. Unless the liquidity of bitcoin market increases manifold from the present levels, it would be very difficult to offer such a service at a cheaper cost than the existing money transfer companies. Conversion of fiat into BTC &amp; back to fiat itself drives up the cost. Add to it regulatory compliance costs. Raising public awareness of the technology is not needed in this case. But liquidity determines whether such a service can be offered at competitive rates.
2. **(or when the recipients can easily spend the BTC directly)** would mean bitcoin technology is used as both a payment mechanism &amp; a currency. This requires people to be able to know how to send &amp; receive bitcoins, how to secure them, how to deal with the fluctuating price of BTC so as to judge whether prices of goods &amp; services are fair in terms of BTC, other basics of bitcoin like transaction confirmations etc. This will require raising public awareness of bitcoin on a massive scale as well as very high liquidity in bitcoin market.
Therefore, liquidity in the bitcoin markets is the critical component. Once sufficient liquidity has been gained, option 1 becomes feasible which over time will lead to option 2 causing disruption on a massive scale. The endgame of bitcoin is option 2. The technology is too damn good to be used only as a payment mechanism &amp; raising public awareness of bitcoin is as important as offering remittance service at a cheaper cost.
@_date: 2014-12-27 11:40:34
The only positive thing here is that he didn't outright reject the idea of bitcoin. He did peddle the usual arguments of concerns related to security &amp; volatility like any other central banker.

His technical know-how is top notch. Just listen to his talks in Australia. I think the amount of good he does for bitcoin far outweighs the occasional lapses that frankly are bound to happen with a nascent technology that invites people with intentions ranging from extremely benign to extremely malicious &amp; everything in between due to its monetary nature. Given the context, I think he is doing an excellent job. Anyone else in his place wouldn't have fared any better. Also, thanks for the tip.

It can't stay at 300-400$ for that long. Either it will be moon or it will be 0. The probability of the price hovering around $300 to $400 for the next 6 years is close to 0. If it is moon then I'd be happy as fuck. If it is 0 then it would've been fun while it lasted. Also, the ultimate measure of bitcoin's success is whether it has been able to uplift the lives of a significant portion of the unbanked population in the world or as Andreas would call it "the other 6 billion".

That is largely because of the small marketcap of bitcoin. Once the scalability issue is sorted &amp; the marketcap increases, there won't be any need to convert to fiat.

I'm telling everyone I encounter about bitcoin. Spreading awareness of the alternative that bitcoin presents in laymans language is the need of the hour. Most people don't think in terms of what money is until the money they take for granted stops working for them which is when they look for alternatives &amp; bitcoin is the best alternative that is out there. I think bitcoin is just one catastrophic economic event away from mass adoption &amp; the chances of such an event occurring is quite high in a financial system that is global in nature.

I don't know if Buffet has privately invested in bitcoin or not. Regardless of what he does in private, he is not going to publicly endorse a technology that has the potential to disrupt the business models of the very institutions in which he holds significant stake. Mass adoption of bitcoin will mean drastically altered business models, elimination of rent seeking behavior &amp; low profit margins resulting in low or negative investment returns to the banking &amp; financial services segment of his portfolio than what his firm expects. So unlike Bill Gates, who knows that mass bitcoin adoption is not going to radically disrupt Microsoft &amp; can publicly endorse the technology, Buffet is in a conflicted position.

My **guess** would be that there will be a bubble that will break ATH &amp; the price will then settle around 850$ but only if no serious technical flaws are discovered in the core protocol during the year. Regardless of what actually happens the tech has captivated my interest to keep me glued in to the developments surrounding it.

This is a pointless exercise. Even if you provide detailed, fact based explanation to all these questions, they are not going to be convinced &amp; you will most likely be ridiculed for challenging the status quo. Even the manner in which they have put up the questions is intended to ridicule your audacity to make such bold claims. Like many other countries, these political parties are in the pockets of the banks who will never embrace a technology that threatens their business model unless forced to do so. By all means, go ahead &amp; give answers as best as you can but don't expect any positive response from their end. You'll be better off directing your efforts at spreading awareness of the technology among the more tech oriented people than these tech-illiterate, clueless &amp; corrupt politicians.

If one looks at the timeline of adoption of new technologies with respect to geography, one can conclude that adoption in developing countries lag adoption in developed countries by at least 2-3 years. It has been the case with personal computers, internet, online commerce, social media, smartphones &amp; other technologies. I admit that bitcoin could reverse this trend due to the nature of technology being more useful to people in developing countries than developed countries but I just don't see that happening in places like India. It could be places where local currencies have become a joke like Argentina &amp; Venezuela where mass bitcoin adoption proves to be the catalyst that sparks adoption in rest of the world. Also, mass adoption of bitcoin taking off in US can't be ruled out as most of bitcoin related activity seems to be happening there &amp; it already has the technological infrastructure &amp; a fragile economy.

TA is useless in a market dominated by whales who can move the price in whatever direction they want. Unfortunately for bitcoin, majority of the whales are bearish. Unless a bullwhale tosses in a few millions, it is not looking good in the short term.

I concur. Bitcoins' endgame of global monetary dominance, if it has to happen, is not going to happen overnight. I was merely pointing out that the idea of anything else, other than fiat or gold as we know it, being treated as money by the masses never really occurred to me before I came across bitcoin. I guess it was the year where I began to question the nature of something that we chase everyday yet don't really understand it well.

And bitcoin or bitcoin like cryptocurrency is supposed to be a solution to this. But with well funded companies like Coinbase &amp; sheeples inherent desire for convenience, we are a long way away from achieving true financial freedom that bitcoin promises. Companies like Coinbase help popularize bitcoin. This is the only good thing they do for bitcoin. Other than this, it is the same banking shit they fling onto their customers in order to comply with **regulations**. Hopefully these companies won't exist in 5 to 7 years.
@_date: 2015-01-01 04:56:46
For me, 2014 was the year where the idea that anything can be money provided a large number of people agree that it is money took hold, all because of bitcoin. Never before did I think about money in such a manner in spite of working in the financial sector. Bitcoin has excellent properties to become a truly global currency once the issues related to security, volatility &amp; scalability are addressed successfully &amp; that is what makes it really really interesting as we move forward, even topping some of the best hollywood movie scripts.

I know. There are huge expectations from the new government to make sweeping changes to the dysfunctional &amp; corrupt bureaucracy &amp; the so called crony capitalism that has existed for decades but frankly they are oblivious to the existence of bitcoin &amp; the people are generally afraid to use anything that doesn't have the government's seal of approval. I live in India &amp; would love to see bitcoin gain some traction especially since the country receives huge remittance flows &amp; bitcoin could potentially find use on a decent scale in this particular area in the short term. But this can only happen if the government gives a green signal to the use of bitcoin which I highly doubt will happen in the short to medium term even after they become cognizant of the technology.

Who is to say they won't introduce lending facility in say 2017 on their way towards becoming a full fledged bitcoin bank with both deposit &amp; lending operations based on fractional reserve. I'm sure regulations that govern their lending activity will get added to whatever regulations they're presently complying with.

Bitcoin will organically develop over time to make these centralized institutions obsolete. It really doesn't matter what his views about bitcoin are now in the the long run. It is a pity that aspiring bitcoin entrepreneurs are forced to ask permission from the very entities that bitcoin will inevitably disrupt whether they like it or not. In 10 years, this guy will be seeking a job that pays in bitcoin.

Oh how ironic, one of the companies that bitcoin is meant to disrupt, that Warren "Bitcoin is a Mirage" Buffet is an investor in now invests in a bitcoin company.

Centralized blockchain is an oxymoron. If these companies create their own coin with in house mining, it will be very inefficient with questionable security as compared to their existing RDBMS to maintain their ledger &amp; will most likely impact their bottomline negatively. So they are better off continuing with the status quo instead of adopting a half baked version of the bitcoin tech. On the other hand, they can create a decentralized altcoin that fulfills a specific market need that bitcoin is not able to meet presently. In that case, they will end up disrupting themselves through that altcoin instead of getting disrupted by bitcoin. So one way or another, disruption is coming more so to the finance industry.

Bitcoin's value when it was released to the public in 2009 was 0. Right now it is around 220$ &amp; has seen multiple bullish &amp; bearish phases with many more to come in the future. It has created many jobs, has attracted big name investors. I'd consider this a success. Just because you entered late in the game doesn't mean that it is a flop. It flops when a critical flaw is discovered in its consensus mechanism that renders the tech unusable &amp; not because you didn't become rich off of it.

Any changes they propose will obviously be vetted by many members of the community &amp; can only be introduced after a certain level of consensus among the stakeholders is reached. Good luck convincing the developers to introduce changes that benefit only them at the expense of others. They can fuck with the dollar price of bitcoin but not with how bitcoin actually works.

Boom &amp; Bust occurring naturally in markets is how it is supposed to be. But in central bank based fiat systems, the bust phase of the market is forcibly prevented through money printing, ever increasing debt &amp; market interventions in the name of "accommodating" the weak economy &amp; in the process enriching the tiny few like this idiot who legitimately benefited from the boom phase &amp; can't weather the bust phase without his cronies in the central bank while screwing the retirees, young &amp; the unborn big time. With bitcoin, people who benefit from boom phase will have the anticipate the bust phase &amp; keep adjusting &amp; innovating to preserve and/or thrive in the marketplace without the cronies with power &amp; influence &amp; this will be a much better system for all of mankind.

While I appreciate the effort put in by people who think about the legal, financial &amp; tax implications of bitcoins in a certain geography, the very nature of the technology doesn't give a damn about it. The tech will continue to exist wherever internet is available regardless of the legal status that the government goons in that region ascribe it. This will be a victory for truth, reason, math &amp; logic based technology over the irrational, arbitrary &amp; capricious control freaks that currently lord over the populace by financially raping them with their elaborate machinations.

Who would want such an outcome? Oh yeah.....the banksters. Thankfully, this should be short term damage &amp; I have some fiat to set up bids in the low 200s should this come to pass.
