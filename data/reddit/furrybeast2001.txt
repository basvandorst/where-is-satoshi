Big buy-in with some of my pension money was about 4000; The day before the Jamie Dimon comments. I've cashed out enough now to be playing entirely with "house money" so totally relaxed about this dip. A few months times we'll be looking back at this correction with a misty-eyed fondness.

Here's the UK version for comparison:
I have 100k in my pension pot. Due to tax relief on contribution, it has only cost 80k to get there. I buy XBT bitcoin tracker fund that mirrors the fiat value. This costs 2.5% admin pa. Once I reach 55, I can withdraw 25% as lump sum completely tax free. The remainder is taxed at the same rate as income when withdrawn (you can even reinvest to get you tax relief all over again)
Sounds like a better deal than you guys get?

Hi, I have a SIPP with Hargreaves Lansdown. You can invest in XBT provider ETNs. Please be very careful though. I have a health issue that means I am unlikely to reach old age, so me investing in bitcoin was less risky than a healthy person. I still only invested what i could swallow losing 100%
@_date: 2019-07-24 23:17:27

I'm now heavily invested in bitcoin (or more correctly, it's pound/dollar value) Whilst I am an idealist, not unlike yourself, I am now in a position where I can use the substantial paper profit I have made thus far to provide me some reassurance that whatever happens to bitcoin I will not end up worse off than when I started this  journey.

I'm currently "cashing out" 10% of my bitcoin holding into traditional investments every time it reaches a certain figure. I'm getting close to having enough "secure" investments to be able to let the remaining bitcoin run it's course and see where it ends up. My goal is retiring at 55. If bitcoin continues to rise in price, even at a much, much reduced rate, I'll have the maximum allowable in my pension pot at 55. It's a great feeling.

I currently have around 25% of my UK retirement fund in a tracker ETF. I changed a considerable amount back into more traditional instruments at the tail end of 2017 when price was rocketing. It has made retirement at 55 a very real prospect (I'm 50 just now) I have been very lucky with timing. I guess lots of others have been less so. I still strongly believe the remaining  25% I have will outperform my remaining investments for the next 5 years - otherwise I would have pulled the lot by now.

That's the whole point. Traders can bail out of their crypto assets, if they feel they will drop in value, without exchanging back to fiat currency. Various advantages, including reduced taxable events. (I'm not a trader, nor have I ever owned Tether so I'm not particularly qualified to answer)

@_date: 2018-06-06 20:43:52
I completely agree. If anything, I think your estimates will be very conservative. I have held a substantial percentage of my UK pension fund in a bitcoin ETF for a considerable time.

Earlier tonight I sent £200 by bank transfer to coinbase pro. It appeared as usable funds about one minute later and I bought bitcoin with a limit order for £1 fee. I then sent it to bitmex with no fee. All done and dusted in under 15mins (including the transfer)

Xbt provider is the company you are looking for. I have some of my pension with them.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:31:06
I have a similar amount of my money tied up in an ETF. (I'm UK based) My view is long term since I can't legally withdraw the cash for another 5 years.
I can see the reasoning for DCA, but if you're brave just lump it all in. The hard part is not becoming obsessed with price fluctuation. (I invested my money the day before the Dimon/China dip!)
If your investment turns good, draw out some of your profits and invest somewhere less volatile as security for your future in case it all goes horribly wrong down the line.
Last piece of advice - don't take financial advice from strangers on the internet.

I'm UK based so can invest my pension fund in a bitcoin based ETF. I done so 3 months ago (approx 40% invested) and obviously the returns up to now have been incredible. I'm 49 and was lucky enough to have an above average pension pot for my age. My bitcoin ETF now accounts for 75% of my portfolio and the price swings are becoming pretty stressful! 
Under UK law I can't touch my pension money until I'm 55, so my aim is to have enough to retire by then. If it all goes horribly wrong, it just means I will have to work until I die - no bigie.

I'm more concerned at the moment by my traditional equity investments than my bitcoin based investment. I believe many other investors will have a similar hedging approach in the future. World markets (especially US) are well overdue a 20%+ correction, and that won't recover in a week!
To clarify, I think many more traditional investors will dip their toes into bitcoin as a hedge against a stock market crash - obviously that would be great for bitcoin.

I've asked the question - no reply as yet. Their terms do indicate the holding company (now coinshare.co.uk) have moved the bitcoin they own to storage that will recognise both coins. That however doesn't answer the question of how the unit value will be calculated during the 3 month post-fork "observation period" - presuming they follow the same path as the BCH fork.
I'm certainly considering pulling my investment before the fork unless these basic questions are addressed fully.

Without asking what you earn now, I take it trading on Localbitcoin is an "adequate" replacement for you salary? - Something I may consider once I retire at 55 for a hobby!

Utter shit. If I had to pay for downvotes, I would in this case. Awful "journalism"

I bought around £19000 worth on the 11sept. Was a bit nervous for a few days after! All is good now though.

My name is John Doe. I am middle aged, average salary. I have a hefty mortgage, and little savings. I believe in decentalised currency but can't really risk putting too much of my rainy day fund into it.
What I do have is fairly healthy pension savings. With a regulated ETF I can "invest" a proportion of that cash in the future of bitcoin, simply, cheaply and with no requirement to know anything about security.
How many John Does are there out there? Quite a few I'd wager.

On that one exchange, at that particular moment, that is what it would have cost to buy all the bitcoin for sale on the ask side up to $9000.
My main interest would be how the other markets would react, and how quickly they would react.

It has served my purposes well in the UK. I can't see what harm further adoption will do. If you are considering trading in ETFs, then by definition you have enough financial savvy to understand the risks.

You do know you don't actually own any bitcoin when you convert with revolut? Only the value of your fiat converted at the current market value.

The signal and battery candles would confuse me. Nice idea though - keep up with development

All the coins in the Mt Gox trustee account will eventually move - that is what the trustee is paid to do...

Great response. Thanks

Last night I sent £500 from my bank to Coinbase (no charge), I then moved it to CoinbasePro (no charge) bought bitcoin on a limit order (£0.75 charge) and then sent to Bitmex (no charge)
The entire process was was completed in under 30 mins.
Say what the hell you like about Coinbase, but with service like that I won't be looking anywhere else for now.

Trading has not stopped, only deposits and withdrawals

Is it just me, or is this the stupidest idea I've heard since the last stupid thing that happened?
Exchanges all over the world having to move funds from deep cold storage "just in case" everyone makes a run on their funds on the 3rd? Clogging up the network and costing everyone involved fees for no reason. Bitcoiners on the whole a intelligent, rational people; I'm sure they have all weighed up the risks of keeping whatever proportion of their funds they're comfortable keeping on an exchange for trading/ease of access. Just a DUMB idea.

As a one-time deal, I'll sell you some BTC for $50k to take back with you. Pm me for details on how to pay.
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:52:44
Take out what you initially invested. You're then left with free Bitcoin, and far less likely to sweat over volatility
@_date: 2019-05-27 23:57:48
Playing devils advocate. Why would I choose your service over Coinbase? At the moment I can send funds straight to CoinbasePro from my UK bank account, buy crypto at MARKET price with tiny fee (0.25%?), Send crypto to external address with no fee, or withdraw back to bank/PayPal, again with no fee.
Apart from being UK based, what's the benefit of me changing?
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:36:00
What worked for me was taking 10% once it reaches a certain figure. You will quickly recover your initial investment in a strong bull market - up to you if you hodl-on after that. I'm sitting with a decent chunk of bitcoin that effectively cost me nothing.
@_date: 2018-12-26 09:53:23
I shall ensure I send all my cold storage coins to an exchange on this date.

Do not tell anyone what to do with THEIR possessions. Your opinion is valid, as is mine. Let's keep it that way.

I'm confused. Are you waiting for a 4k thousand dollar dollar bitcoin or a $4hundred00 dollar?

After a week of wild, unpredictable 10%+ swings, the SEC are going to say, "hell yeah, this is an instrument our pension funds need access to IMMEDIATELY!"
