[I wonder if we'll ever find out?](

But he's lying out of his ass about this. He claimed it was an accident, which is *absurd.*


"Haha! We pranked our users and they'll never know it! Also we made money off of it! April fools!"
Yeah, bullshit. He's lying.

Right. Because everybody isn't falling over themselves to excuse illegal and obviously planned behaviour, it's a conspiracy from the mythical hivemind.


*The massive profit they would have made if they hadn't been caught.* You think they would have turned this off themselves? Nope. They'd just keep on mining.


*There was no fucking joke.* It's not "in bad taste," it's just nonexistent. Where is the joke? HAHA, I STEALTH INSTALLED MALWARE ON YOUR COMPUTER, ISN'T THAT FUNNY? No. No it's not funny because *nobody's gonna notice.* The only way people notice is if it lasts more than a day, in which case it's not exactly an April fucking fools joke, is it?


I know he's got an incredibly scummy reputation. Now I know why.
You're worse than a goddamn Biodrone.

I've already apologized in private, but I may as well do it publicly as well. I acted like a jerk here, and there was absolutely no reason to. I totally disagree with everything you said, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm right, only that I think I am. Even if it does turn out that I'm totally correct, I didn't need to respond like this. 100% my bad.

"We considered doing something extremely illegal and unethical, but decided getting caught wasn't worth the consequences."
That's really not any better, even if it's true, which it isn't. And the fact that they keep saying that makes it worse, because it shows forethought and planning. This wasn't just some stupid and impulsive idea.

Funny story. A couple threads were locked before the big one that blew up.
Also, there is absolutely fucking nothing that is funny about installing malware on someone's computer. Not even in a "too far" sense. There's just no damn joke. The *only* reason you do it is if you intend to profit off of it. This was not an April fools joke, and anyone who believes him when he says that is a complete moron.
Also, he's changed his story several times already just in the last couple hours.
