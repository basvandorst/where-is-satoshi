Thank you for sharing your views, I find them very enlightening. 
I agree that shnorr, mast, LN are absolutely critical to the future of bitcoin. 
Regarding what you said about the spam attacks,  the increases are so minimal that it would take a year to double to 2mb from my understanding. In this time LN will be enabled allowing the mempool to be cleared and bitcoin to be viewed as a successful currency. Upon bitcoin becoming a useable network/p2p cash system wouldn’t that heavily reduce the viability of these attacks?
I am all for this new technology but as I said before the current fees are utterly ridiculous and the fact that it is cheaper for me to mail a copy of my private key to someone is absurd.
Could you possibly explain to me what is the big problem with raising the blocksize to 2mb or 1.25mb? I hear the slippery-slope argument a lot but I don’t believe that would happen with the future technology that is coming as you stated. 
From what I understand, what you’re saying is if the blocks are a little bigger and fees are cheaper we will witness more attacks and the blockchain will be massive. But we’re not making it 8mb. We shouldn’t give in to these attacks which limit our network and force us to have these high fees. I don’t see how 1.25 or 2mb blocks would create such a huge issue regarding bloating. 
Thanks for your replies and knowledgeable responses!

This is the real question. I am all for the legacy chain but I do not understand why not a simple **small** increase in block size. I agree with erik voorhees on the matter that a minimal increase in size would reduce fees astronomically. Look where we are at now $30-$40 txn fees. That's honestly utterly ridiculous. 
Jesus do we need lightning network ASAP. Thank goodness it'll be out in &lt;6 months.

If we made it 2mb there would be a HUGE difference. The fees would be reduced exponentially and newcomers to bitcoin would be welcomed again. 
These fees are driving away people who are just finding out about bitcoin. Think about it. If I bought $60 in bitcoin and I was completely new to this and had heard I should store my savings in a cold wallet, upon transfer I would be extremely upset half of my money has just vanished. 
What I saw in another post here on the subreddit was a great idea. An increase of 50kb or something every time the daily block average is &gt;95% full and a decrease of 50kb every time the daily block average is &lt;85% full. This would make bitcoin more dynamic while carefully adjusting to the needs of the network. Why not implement a change like this? At most in a year we double to 2mb. Blocksize increases will be necessary for btc so why not start slowly and safely now?
