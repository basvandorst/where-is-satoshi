Well I guess an acronym is fine, I thought it was just a meme that meant nothing. Still a pretty good indicator of how clueless a lot of this community is lol.

how are you defining money? Bitcoin is subject to capital gains tax. Money/asset = store of value, tax implications aside 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:24:08
All assets are by definition stores of value, it’s more a matter of their liquidity 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:01:41
Money isn’t an asset...?

You should pay them all off get a job and keep buying BTC.
Seriously.

Eh, every stock and bond individually has different levels of liquidity - I’d say bitcoin is pretty liquid, in relating it to a stock or bond you need to look at it’s spread and volume. Those can indicate liquidity more accurately in all asset classes.

Lol he said this while JPM has been having its clients invest in bitcoin ETN’s. He’s either a moron or he made this statement in an attempt to drive down prices to better position his firm/clients.
