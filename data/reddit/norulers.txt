A corollary that usually keeps me from impulse buying when something is "on sale" is: 
"There will always be another sale" .

What if don't sell for dollars, but, instead, you send it from your Exchange to some arbitrary address (like maybe one generated by a hardware wallet)?

I disagree. Government is willing to go to war over anything that will keep it in power - especially non-real (fiat) money.

It won't even become that if it never develops as an acceptable means of exchange first. The reason gold is still useful as a store of value it that it has a very long and well known history as a means of exchange. That cultural memory of gold's legacy is the only thing keeping its current store of value status intact.

Very cool. Thank you!

Thank you! Something like this is what I was looking for.

It's not necessary for everyone who uses bitcoin to run a full node - for the same reason that not everyone in the general population needs to carry a concealed weapon. If it is well known that a few percent of the population is armed at any given time or location, that is usually enough to deter criminals.

Technically, true. But very hard to track. And very unlikely the IRS will bother you. By law, every private barter transaction is a potentially a taxable event. Nobody reports them. Because the IRS can't trace them. You would be a fool to report them. 
The IRS can really only tax you on transactions that involve US dollars *and* that leave an easy paper trail (i.e. 1099, etc). Any transactions that involve BTC like cash can't (easily) be traced to you. In rare cases, they will go after high rollers based on visible assets that are "unreasonable" for their known fiat currency income. 
If you buy a product or service with Bitcoin that doesn't leave a some kind of significant paper trail, you *may* legally owe taxes in theory, but reporting it on your 1040 is just silly. Would you really report 0.03 BTC that you receive into your AirBitz wallet in exchange for your comic book collection that you sell at your garage sale?

Pretty trippy analysis. But, it has a ring of truth.

There is no such thing as intrinsic value. Not for gold. Not for BTC. Not for anything. Value is ALWAYS subjective. Something is only **worth** what **you** are willing to trade for it. If I have a gallon of water and you need it to avoid dying, you will trade me your chest of gold for my gallon of water. To me, your gold was worth a gallon of water. To you, my water was worth a chest of gold.
