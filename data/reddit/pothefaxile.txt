Hah the math is off by a digit you are right, I attended a fun Easter party in my defense :)
$5,000,000 * ~18,000,000BTC = 9e13
~90,000,000,000,000 = 90T
So it looks like a 5 million dollar coin would be a 90T market cap you were right about 100T. 
Getting to a 90T market cap would be like super end game, it would require Bitcoin to fully penetrate most of the largest global markets absorbing a sizable percentage of the following markets below.
If Bitcoin can digest a portion of the derivative markets, and some others, it is possible to see the market cap get in the 10's of trillions. Some estimate that 1.2 Quadrillion dollars of "wealth" exists in the global derivative contract markets but no one knows the true value of all derivatives.
A more likely number we could see in 10 years if things work out well, would probably be a factor of 10 less than I suggested previously, prices per coin could reach well above 250k-500k by 2030.

One thing we know is the new floor will be roughly 3-5 times higher than the previous floor.

Probably not but actually it could be... for 5m BTC it would be ~9 trillion dollar market cap. I think all gold in the world is something like 14 trillion, bitcoin can affect other markets with as much or more money as well so it could grow to 9 trillion or higher market cap as it cannibalizes even some percentages of other markets.

In someone's defense for purchasing $5 a week, if Bitcoin does go up 1000 times its value over next 10 years. Sure would be great to have made $5000 a week investing 5 bucks.

Altcoins usually trade ahead of Bitcoin swings. After we breached 6100, I expect us to raise slowly over a day or 2 until some price we hit the bull trap, that will seem at the time like this bull run is over and the bears are back in town. But in reality its just institutional investors taking their profits they cant pass up those gains, after this happens we will see huge gains and new all time highs. Be patient
