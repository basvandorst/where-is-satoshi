Unfortunately, it doesn't actually work like that.
I'm a hypnotist, so it's not that I'm not taking it seriously. There are definitely times when information is in there and hypnosis can help dig it out. This is one of the cases where it's not actually in there. 
"Photographic memory" appears to not actually exist - and the people with "photographic-like" memory actually use their brains very differently to put information *into* memory, not just to retrieve it.
We don't actually commit everything to memory. We also get the the impression that we see everything around us in detail, though our eyes only have high resolution at the center. We think we're actually reading words, yet miss misspellings and doubled words (reread this paragraph carefully). 
We're actually just looking at our brains representation of reality and the appearance of detail is really just a detailed "table of contents". We can't clearly see things out of the corner of our eyes, but it's clear that we could if we wanted to. Even if it was plainly visible and some one asked you to count the small handful of skittles on the table - if you closed your eyes before knowing to take special note of what the skittles looked like, they're gone.
It's like those dreams where you only realize that no one had faces after waking up and trying to recount your dream. If your friend had never taken special note to remember the key - or had to actually recite it over and over instead of using copy/paste, then it's likely that it was never represented by anything more than "string of random characters" in his brain, and hypnosis would not help.
However, if he did at some point recite it or try to memorize it, you might get something. Even if you don't get all the digits, there may be enough that you can brute force the rest.
