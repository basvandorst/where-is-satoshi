They ran an offer for 1.06 bitcoin for every bitcoin you send them.
Everyone of course was skeptical and sent .002 and .02 and .1 and then built up to 1 over the course of the day. We were all talking to the guy running it and he was answering all tweets, getting things fixed, paying us out. ACTING LIKE A CSR REP FOR A PROFESSIONAL COMPANY. 
Then when I got back a full bitcoin plus .06 I was like...okay this guy is actually doing this. I'll try more. 
45 minutes turned into 2 hours turned into 24. At midnight at Xmas the description on the site disappeared and all there was, was a rude image of a girl flipping us off "happy  a giant F U. 
fuck me. I didn't even lose that much. It's just sad someone would take that from me on xmas. I was about to donate 1btc to Sean's outpost too for the holidays

It didn't seem that way as it unfolded. It really didn't.

You know, you really didn't see how it panned out. It wasn't obvious. I know people who were taken for 2-4 times more than I put down. They are having a really bad day. I feel bad for them.
I'm not here looking for sympathy. I'm asking people to not make my mistakes.

Not so happy, but appreciate the sentiment.
Maybe I'll go sell my ass on the street for btc. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:20:31
about 3k.

hindsight is 20/20. It clearly is a textbook ponzi.

If I have something in cold storage I can't spend it as easily ;) 
Just because I didn't articulate the obvious lesson doesn't mean there aren't others to learn.
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:24:39
Absolutely. That's the worst part of the whole thing.
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:21:01
Painfully so..
@_date: 2013-12-25 05:35:57
Thats why I did the tests.
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:53:18
Did not even make sense until the rest of the site disappeared. It just seemed like an out of place graphic.
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:24:24
A lesson harshly learned. Talking with the others who lost some..
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:52:48
Im not sure we can. They are sending the btc through a tumbler and have escaped with 30+ BTC total from everyone. 
I am...so broke. On Christmas.. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:47:44
This experience has solidified my belief in cold storage. Out of sight. Out of mind. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:43:33
It was. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:57:00
if I had any left.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:13:53
didn't quite go down like that.
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:53:35
No one deserves to be robbed on Christmas. Through stupidity or otherwise.

It was an expression meaning I just have to be a little more frugal than normal.
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:56:52
It wasn't a large amount in the long run. It's enough to make me think long and hard on it. But not enough to ruin my life. I'll just be eating ramen the next 3-4 months.

Best Bitcoin Scam.
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:28:25
Till then. Fuck me.
