Nope.

Don’t diversify! Just hold btc. U will be much better off. Also look into using something like ledn.io to custody your btc if your not confident in doing it yourself. They also pay interest in bitcoin which further helps your odds of success!!
holding is a hard game both in the down lows and in the up highs. But it’s fun either way you look at it!

Your electrum wallet may be SegWit. Are ur addresses starting with 3 or bc1? Then it’s a SegWit wallet and any transaction from that Electrum wallet counts as a SegWit tx. The coinbase to Electrum is not

No, no answer found- my question was prompted by thinking about how to secure my phrases. It’s more important than securing the HW wallet. So most people think splitting the words up makes most sense. But not recommended. 
Better to use multi sig wallets and give the full key to trusted people. 
Read Pamela Morgan’s book it’s excellent and shows the best way to long term HODL.

Different strokes for different folks. 
Why trust when you can verify for yourself? It’s really pretty easy to start a full node. I guess these days there are a number of reputable organizations you can check with. When I first started I didn’t know who is trustworthy. Except that I can verify for myself. Also let’s say you trust coinbase. Then then your chain forks and they follow the ‘other chain’ well now you don’t get a choice anymore. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 06:12:47
Kinda rambling, but yeah- point is - How do you know someone sold you bitcoin? You validate it using a full node!

Thanks for the great examples. Im glad you gave a second example because Hz and RPM are pretty much the same thing;) 
So, I understand that it’s comparing apples and oranges, but is there a rule of thumb  for how many FLOPs are needed to produce a hash?
Comparing different blockchain’s difficulty and hash rate gives a good comparison of network security, but I am trying to get a handle of how secure it is in terms of computer power. 
Say Pinky and The Brain try to take over the world by replacing all the BOINC computers to mine bitcoin... would that be a worthwhile attempt for my lil villains?
Also on a side there are over 150,000 active participants on the BOINC network. Consider each one is a node, they are about 10x more distributed than bitcoin.

Bitcoin could go to the moon and you will still be renting or homeless. Take care of you basic needs first. Then invest what you can for the future. Maybe use your 22k to get a mortgage you can afford, then buy a house and keep 10k of your low interest mortgage and buy bitcoin. Then make sure to pay your interest+principal down each year.

“Now Mimblewimble, Monero, even Namecoin, very old things like Namecoin are interesting or like jokes like Doge coin. To do a coin that represent a joke is interesting but the problem is that you should expect, use speculation. You cannot really use that as money. At best, it could be a collectible, like a digital collectible. You can have fun with it. You can sell it, maybe make some money, but it will not be reliable in the future as a tool for economical trade.” -Giacamo Zucco from the Tatiana show Ep 89.
