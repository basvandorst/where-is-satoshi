Yes, that's my question, but a new commitment may add a new output.

The point is to avoid stealing coins by someone broadcasting one of the former (revoked) commitments. If one acts non cooperatively, you have a window of 1000 blocks to resolve it, and the only way is by broadcasting.

How is LN hidden when everything is public?
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:56:39
I believe that a transaction that exceeds channel capacity can be split into multiple transactions. Since the confirmation time is expected to be less than a couple of milliseconds, even partitioning into 100 chunks  would not cause exceeding one second.
Not sure if it is LN protocol functionality all wallet functionality. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:32:42
Great that the diagram is plotted in logarithmic scale. Linear is misleading.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:38:59
Originally, the channel could be funded with one party only. Recent approach to LN - I believe - requires that both parties fund equally a multisig transaction. I based this on Andreas' 2nd edition of Managing Bitcoin that is newer than many of the former approaches.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:27:01
I understand that the payer and payee must agree on the total amount to be transfered, no matter what routing will be applied for the individual chunks. The only question is that the payment would not be atomic. This is like sending a file over TCP/IP, when higher level application keeps track of all the packets to be sent. 
@_date: 2019-07-19 17:38:56
Unfortunately, it does not enable recovery of the private keys and addresses. It only allow for sending funds to another address
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:36:33
1. Everybody reading this forum knows that if you don't own the private keys, you don't own the Bitcoin. It is obvious since MtGox 4 years ago.
2. 1% is very poor. Typical spread (eg. Bitstamp) i below 0.1%.
3. If you want real exchange rates, I recommend using bitpay.com credit card. The rate matches that of Coinbase that is usually higher than average. No commission. Account credited in USD or EUR.

Any discussion on LN is pointless, as most of the wallets did not implement segwit yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:59:25
Hope so. But Coinbase could benefit from segwit now and did not implement it for now 4 months (could have started implementation even before it was launched). Yet, Coinbase has the highest inflow of new customers. If there is a conspiracy between Coinbase, Roger and miners, they wouldn't bother about minority using LN, as they do not bother about those using ETH and LTN for transfers today.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:23:01
Technically, the transfer is done within a few seconds. For reasons not fully understood, most recipients want # confirmations, ranging 1-6, sometimes more. 100 to claim coinbase.

Good idead - didn't think about it before. Buying miners instead of mining equipment. Actually, may be more profitable.

A better solution may be Ethereum approach - smaller blocks and shorter block time - uncles instead of orphans. Now ETH avg block time is 10-15 sec, and they talk about 500 ms. 133 MB is equivalent of 1 MB blocks with 5 sec block time.

Once they run out of money, they will start imposing higher taxes on properties that will cause bankruptcies and foreclosures.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:08:39
Andreas didn't highlight one of the most important arguments. Any profitable human activity may eventually be reduced to energy consumption. If mining shit-coin is more profitable, people will move to shit-coin. If mining gold is more profitable, people consume energy to mine gold, or crude oil, or coal, etc. The calculation must take into account ALL consumption, including the energy consumed by the company employees at households. Thus altogether this is about how much money to invest to make more money. Bitcoin mining does not differ from any other activity in this sense. Should POW be replaced with POS, the energy would also be consumed on the same level, but in another way.

The only legit altcoin is Litecoin 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:48:18
Basically, I do agree.
Technically, futures may last one year, but only the oldest series matters, and investors rollover every 3 months.
I also doubt that shorting futures would be profitable, because the basic instrument is expected to rise. If there is 90% probability that the final price will be higher, there is enough money to buy long positions to stop decline (technically, number of short/long positions is equal, but it is about the capital to stop the drop).
I also suppose that the current rise is caused by investors buying BTC to hedge future investments.

To be honest, I am happy thar not so many newbies enter the market before it is mature, meaning scalable, with LN implemented, no bottleneck on exchanges - including bottleneck with new applications, etc. 
On the other hand, however, the sooner the number of users (voters?) achieves the point of no return, the better to stop the possibility of bad regulations or banning.

For each futures series (code) there is a target date it expires, usually one year ahead. The final payoffs will  be set according to the underlying security (bitcoin) price. We can rationally assume that the price a year from now will be higher than today. It means that there is more investors willing to buy long position than short position at the current price. As OP said, each long position has a counterpart short. If there is more willing to buy long, the market should move up until the equilibrium is achieved. I believe it is currently at around $30.000.

BTC is not altcoin
@_date: 2018-08-15 07:57:37
Besides the fact that I'm also against the ETFs, custodial BTC services do already exist and people want them. One example is Revolut which lets one trade BTC without actually having access to private keys and addresses. On larger scale, there are Swiss banks that offer custodial services, because this is the very reason why the banks do exist. If one wants to invest $10M in BTC, one does not want to assume responsibility for the keys storage and management. Instead, a large financial institution with 100+ years history and substantial capitalization will do the trades in client's name. Should it lose the keys, the loses would be covered by the its other funds. No one can stop people from trusting others in order to manage their wealth. I do not know, however, how would the agreement between the client and custodian resolve the question of voting rights. It is very likely, however, that - similar to voting rights from owning stocks being also managed by a custodian - it is the client who maintains the voting right, or the custodian votes according to the client's instructions.

The logic is that Chinese buy BTC for Yuan, transfer abroad and convert to USD. The "withdrawal" ban means ones you buy BTC on exchange, you can't send it to your private address.
@_date: 2017-02-13 18:11:05
We need to forget about fiat and do payments in BTC only. Any EXCHANGE, unless payment is done with cash, is related to a government controlled bank account.
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:12:25
Yes. Actually, the sell off might have also been caused by the fact that they have BTC stored on the exchange and the only way to withdraw the value (now) is by converting it to Yuan.
On the other hand, BTC as a way to transferring Chinese money out is not a very effective method. There was a post on reddit by a guy who said that he attempted to make a business by offering transfer abroad by means of BTC. Eventually, he found out that other methods as cheap as 0.1% commission exist in China.
Consequently, the "logic" of the ban on BTC withdrawal is not a big deal for China. It is merely, I suppose, a question of meeting AML/KYC regulations.

A theory that adding ETFs to security increases volatility seems doubtful. Rather, while BTC owners are encouraged not to keep open position on exchanges (for safety reasons) unless they are going to do a trade soon, a move may be caused with a relatively small investment. ETFs/futures should make a counter effect.
Once there was a ban on opening short positions on some securities during the 2008 crisis, with an intent to limit volatility, and the result was just an opposite.

"block size is always a HF by definition"
There is a SF alternative possible: block size increase with extension blocks.
I believe, it is possible to join SW and block size as SF, and then continue with payment channels, and forget about touching the main protocol forever. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:48:48
The logic is correct.
A Chinese has a plan:
1. Send Yuan to exchange
2. Convert Yuan to BTC (buy)
3. Transfer BTC to another exchange (like Bitstamp), i.e. BTC address -&gt; BTC address.
4. Convert BTC to USD (sell)
5. Witdraw USD
The operation "3." is just BTC withdrawal - the same problem as was the case of Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:22:43
We have also to consider an option that a payment channel scalability will be introduced without solving malleability, or even without a SF/HF. The best proposal to date is TumbleBit.
Possibly, many incompatible implementations will be built on top of the current Bitcoin protocol. As far as I can understand, TumbleBit requires action from the waller providers only, not Core/BU signalling/activation. It is probably the fastest approach that may pass through, either.
@_date: 2017-02-01 09:22:45

@_date: 2017-03-06 15:42:55
If neither Core nor BU give up, what other options do we have? A TubleBit w/o HF/SF? The functionality of Bitcoin becomes dramatic. Now I have a transaction stuck for 7 hours w/o a single confirmation yet, at 105 s/byte (a default value set by blockchain.info).
@_date: 2017-03-01 14:58:08
The point is, the growth in RMB/USD doesn't necessarily mean that more people actually trade BTC on LocalBitcoins. It may merely reflect the fact that they pay more. BTC price has grown 20% during last 2 weeks. Possibly, the shown diagram presents a combined effect of both. Please note also, that the diagram's baseline is not ZERO but 80, and only top 10% of the price range is shown.
Global trading on LB doesn't exceed 5%, and 8% in CNY (last day).

Amid impossibility of getting a winner (BU or Core) in the near future, wouldn't it be right from the Core to offer SegWit + one time block size increament to 2 MB? If the proposal gets 95% mining power, the risk related to HF would be negligible. Wouldn't it be a fulfilling of the HK agrement?
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:22:55
It is unlikely that SegWit will be activated ever, even if a majority of miners moves to BU. The 95% threshold is too high and there is a deadline of Nov 15th.

In case of Ethereum, it was the forked currency that maintained the original name ETH, and the original currency is now called ETC (classic). Possibly, BU will be named BTC and Core will be named BTL (limited?). Who owns the names?
Now, eight month after the Ethereum fork, the best strategy for the owners was to HODL. The combined value (USD) is now more than before the fork. As for today, however, conversion to BTC was a better strategy, if done before the fork, not after.

Miners are not the working class, because workers do not invest their own money, while the miners do. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 07:08:10
The idea that users rather than miners control bitcoin is similar to when employees rather than owners control a company. They have trade unions and worker's councils, and make a claim of representing a majority. This is a pure socialism against the libertarian view, the latter also a foundation of bitcoin. Eventually, it is the trade union leaders that control the minds of majority, with little investment, by means of eg. discussion lists. Their role is to make the majority think the leader's opinion is deeply their own.
I do not clearly definitely support Core, BU or None. I believe that the very Satoshi's idea that the miners control bitcoin is better than anything like UASF. People change opinions if, by supporting the 'ideas', they are going to risk some money. If it is not hash power, we will be back with resolving who is a real personality or a bot, who imposes ban on Reddit forum, eventually who is going to invest more money, but indirectly rather than via hash power control.
@_date: 2019-03-27 15:26:55
The very reason why we need Bitcoin is that with a Bitcoin payment both parties always know where the money actually is. As for banks, even in case of SEPA/IBAN transfer, one party may always maintain that the money was sent, while the other that didn't receive. The money resides in a sort of limbo. Just recently I made a SEPA/IBAN payment and still waiting for my account to be credited - now 7 days - and don't know which party to trust.

I would, however, avoid trading with Bitstamp in future, as the risk of freezing my funds seems too high. As a matter of fact, all the correspondence is conducted via a bloody 'support ticket'.

Let me explain to you that your answer is a complete nonsense. Look at the original post, i.e., the support guy asking about passing to Bitstamp 'addresses' that hold bitcoin. Let's assume that someone tells you the address that holds 2 BTC. Then, in a week, a deposits of 2 BTC is done from another address. Would you freeze the funding then as money laundering?
The problem is that the guy asking does not understand the Bitcoin infrastructure. Nowadays, 99% of the BTC in circulation (those frequently deposited/withdrawn, not those hold in cold storage for centuries) are kept in HD wallets. Without going into details, the HD wallet policy forces one time address usage (for spending). More than that, HD Wallet users are usually not aware of the addresses they are spending from, unless doing more scrutiny.
If depositing Bitstamp exchange is not the only reason for owning Bitcoin, then it is highly likely that the information passed to Bitstamp becomes obsolete very quickly.  Hence, such information passed is completely useless. 
I understand that Bitstamp must observe many regulations, however, if one goes into details, the questions asked do not provide any valuable information for goal they are intended to meet.

The current price is always a trade-off between the fear and the hope. It is exactly the same as the meaning of the term: PREDICTION MARKET. The market knows the price best. Should more overall trust be gained, it would be immediately reflected in the price. 
An early investor is someone who has more understanding of the BTC, or secret knowledge, or just more luck. It's usually very hard to list the pros and cons that influence the current price. Since pros are more common at this forum, let us consider one the well know cons for a while: the fate of the Ethereum project. Then, how likely it is that a group of smart guys will hard-fork BTC one day in order that some of their targets have not been met so far? And if one listens to what Vitalik says, he is so jealous about the success of BTC that he is openly predicting a forthcoming HF.

I may be wrong by I suppose that first we must see what happens when segwit is activated. Then we will   see if block are full again. May be that 1mb + segwit is enough for long time. May be that 2mb is not enough. A decision to increase block size may be postponed until results of segwit are known. If LN is inevitable, it does not matter if we have 1mb or 2mb,  and with 1mb it is easier.

There is, however, still a potential risk o stealing ones coins with a sort of double-spend attack, not to happen in the near future, however.

Definitely, governments is the main concern.
There is a point, however. A country, like US, may be afraid that banning BTC in US, while not banning in China, will leave US technologically far behind China (just like not sending man on Mars).

Virtually every human business activity is ultimately converson of energy into money. Even if an entrepreneur purchases other goods than energy (in the manufacturing process), their price is eventually dependent on their energy consumption. The price of hiring a human worker is also dependent on overall that person's energy consumption. There is no difference between mining BTC, gold or any other business activity. What matters is how much provision one can make but it also converges (decreases) to some value set by the free market.

Now 5 blocks already. Doesn't seem that BTC lost a substantial share of the mining power. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:04:48
The reasons of delay in making next block are obvious:
1. ViaBTC reduced BCH hash power from 210 to 70 PH
2. Mysterious HK miner that has found most of the fork blocks (possibly using more power, than ViaBTC) has probably quit, as he announced earlier today.
However, some assert that miner do it intentionally to trigger difficulty retarget. Personally, I do not believe that, becuase that would force them to admit that 20 blocks withdrawal condition has been met. Delaying withdrawals is now the only way to maintain impression that BCH has any real value.
On the other hand, however, if I am wrong, that would be happy day for me, because 2700 + 700 = 3400.

When the space of private keys (256-bit) is comparable to the space of bitcoin addresses (160 bit), the mapping is either surjective or nearly surjective (even if colission exists, it is not likely that will ever be found). This is not the case of finding the terms that sum up to a given result, which has multiple solutions for natural numbers and infinitely many for integers.

Yes, there is 2^96 collisions for each address, but for practical purposes there is no collision. Satoshi could have made addresses 256-bits long + 32 bits for checksum, making a total of 288+ bits, but he found it impractical and decided to limit the address length. The point is, we do not expect a collision to happen. 
To be honest, there is 50% probabilty that the collision would happen after sqrt(2^160) = 2^80 private keys have been created. We may be unaware of it, as a check still requires 2^160 comparisons. On the other hand, however, the number 2^80 is not that big, it is around 10^24 keys, or 10^14 keys per person, provided each individual uses BTC. I hope, the number of unspent outputs would be much lower and the collision is not going to happen within the unsent outputs. 
Possibly, the demand for new keys will not be so high, once the LN takes over the majority of transactions.

...The speed at which you download a new copy of the blockchain is more dependent on the # of connections you have with the network. To increase the number of connections to the Bitcoin network and improve Block chain speed open/forward port 8333 to the computer which is running the client.
This will reduce the delay (latency) between the time new transaction/blocks occur and when you learn of them. Having more connections means on average you are closer to any event (the a node submitting a new transaction, or new block solution) and thus learn about it quicker.

ICO style shares are w/o lawyers. In future, we could have regular shares and real estate property rights as colored Bitcoin tokens, as well, subject to changes in regulations. In general, however, wherever the ETH token is applicable, it is much better if implemented as colored Bitcoin, because of larger economy (safety) is behind. 
There is many more on the lower scale. Imagine trading a sword (colored coin) of an online RPG. Hardly its value would be more than the current minimum mining fee. This is the reason why we would prefer trading it on LN, not to mention speed and P2P manner (i.e. not letting the whole world learn that you have just purchased a sword).

External/Independent blockchain is a flawed idea by itself, because:
\- to be decentralized, someone has to mine it, effectively creating a new crypto coin
\- economy is not big enough to gain confidence, risking a 50% atack
\- any blockchain that is not a copycat of Bitcoin requires substantial effort, scrutiny, testing, etc.
The ultimate approach to future economy is a single blockchain (the one of Bitcoin) and all the tokens implemented as colored Bitcoins. This is the best way to guarantee that a legal/trading event will not be accidentally or intentionally revoked.

The rule "never invest more than you can afford to loose" is fundamentally wroing. Every investment entails a risk. If you do not invest, but keep your funds in fiat, you risk as well, as was the case of those fiat hodlers in Cyprus in 2013 or USD hodlers in USA in 1933. The former ones lost everything, the latter around 50% of their lifetime savings.
Every enterprise is a question of evaluation of a risk and a bit of luck. There are investments that are fundamentally senseless, like buying lottery tickets or funding state backed pension system above the minimum required by law. 
As for today, nobody can tell for sure what is a better method of keeping the savings than in bitcoin. One may argue that diversification is the right way, yet there is no simple answer.

"Currently, a single bitcoin transaction consumes enough electricity to power a house for a few days, and can cost more than $20 USD."
I did one yesterday for 0.07 USD (more than 1000 EUR) - 30 minutes. To compare, the SEPA transfers at HSBC are priced:  For amounts up to €1,000 flat charge of €1.00. For amounts over €1,000 flat charge of €4.00. Non-SEPA Euro transfer to other banks. Flat charge of €4.00. Most do not confirm in less than 24h, but I'm not sure who to blame.
It is 15-60 times more expensive than Bitcoin transfer.  And the elctricity usage is directly convertible to money, as well.

The plot of the film is far from logical. 
The youtuber, whose real surname is Dubiel, and who plays himself, issues a cryptocurrency named - Dubiel Coin. In the beginning, he manages to sell the cryptocurrency to an undisclosed person, possibly for fiat. In the final scene, however, another person pronounces a success of scamming someone, while counting fiat notes. Did Dubiel buy back the crypto?
In the end the Chevrolet Corvette C7 Stingray is encumbered to force a payment of a parking ticket. 
The obvious conclusion after watching the film - buy bitcoin, keep away from other cryptocurriencies.

The bad practice of waiting for 6 confirmations lies on the seller's side and is not a limitation of Bitcoin. Once a transaction has been broadcasted, it may be assummed as valid within a couple of seconds with nearly 100% certainty, possibly higher than a CC payment. The risk of double spending is negligible. The question of whether it will be included in one or another (possibly orphaned) block is meaningless. It is of even less concern, if a seller is doing hundreds of sales with a value of a coffee each.
Sadly, if that is a concern for the sellers, side channels will not resolve it. I can imagine sellers waiting until a side channel transaction is eventually converted back to the regular bitcoin, which - instead of expediting - will slower accepting bitcoin.

Frankly, there is no fully trustless system. How many of the Bitcoin users do really understand why elliptic curve encryption or SHA256 are unbreakable, why there exist attacks on prime factorization but not on SHA256 (yet), how likely it is that quantum computing will break ECDSA, how do we know that our computer is not compromised on hardware level?
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:37:09
What do you mean by fake? A transaction must be valid, i.e. properly formatted and referred to unsent outputs. The only possibility for the attacker is a double spend attempt. A window for having an opportunity to file a second transaction for the same output(s) lasts only a few seconds - more or less the time it takes for a TCP packet to travel round the world. The attacker must be relatively powerful to have a chance to succeed, one for whom making $3 deal is negligible. A properly configured merchants node can decrease the risk even further. A risk of starting a claim/dispute in case of CC payment is much higher, especially because the payment processor may accept a claim w/o even asking the merchant. 
My point is not so much technical but practical. I see no reason why a coffee bar would need waiting for BTC payment 30 minutes, while a CC transaction is accepted in a couple of seconds on regular basis.

Buying BTC and making a paper wallet are two separate questions.
You can buy BTC on any exchange, like: 
Then you have to make a paper wallet here: 
Then witdraw your purchased BTC to the address on the paper wallet, keeping the wallet's private key secret.
To be honest, a "paper walet" is any case when you print private key on paper, or write it down with a pen, or print a QR code representing the string.
I you know the private key, you do not need the public address anymore, as it can be "computed" from the private key.

The main reason a government does not label Bitcoin illegal is because it fears the other government would not. It's like the OECD list of tax haven countries - its existence is backed by the mutual agreement of the majority of the states.
To clarify, the US government would be happy to ban Bitcoin, but it fears the Chinese would not and gain a technological/economical progress that would eventually lead to them landing on Mars first. They also do fear that, once they ban Bitcoin on this early stage, it will be replaced with much more challenging Bitcoin Unbannable. The territory of virtual currencies is still mostly unchartered.
I do also hope that many if not most of the decision makers have already secured a portion of their assets in Bitcoin. The share of the assets protected by means of Bitcoin will be growing due to Bitcoin surpassing other investments. Eventually, I can't imagine why would they cut the branch they are sitting on.

All that matters is the safety of your private key. You can store it in many ways: print on paper, memorize in your brain, or even store on paper and have it encrypted with another password. You can also memorize a passphrase (aka: braiwallet) that is not the private key, but can easily be converted to. You can purchase a USB-like hardware wallet, commonly referred to as "trezor", like  (many vendors). Not only your private key may be stolen. It may also be lost accidentally. 
If you have the private key, you can create a spending transaction w/o any "wallets", but it requires a bit of understanding and skills. A transaction can be prepared on a computer completely disconnected from the web, with tools like:  Once the transaction is created (a string of 300 bytes), you can share it with anybody, provided the private key is still safe. Anybody can broadcast transaction now or any time in future.
Most users, however, upload their private key to a "wallet", a web site or smartphone application. You do not have to keep it in the wallet all the time. You can upload it right before spending. In theory, wallets like Mycelium on smartphone andBreadwallet on iOS are safe, because the private key is uploaded to the device only, not elsewhere. The safety, however, is only guaranteed by the reputation of the application provider, and by safety of the smartphone  (no virus).
Depending on how much BTC you want to purchase, I would also recommend spliting to multiple private keys, and making experiments with amounts as low as a couple of $$$.
Also beware fake web sites that mimic original sites (do phishing). Do not trust Google results - double check the spelling of the url, like blockchain.info, and not eg. biockchain.info

A hard fork does not require 100% nodes, not even 1% nodes to be correct. After a hard fork we hope the majority will follow one of the chains. It need not be the case, however. We had a fork ETC/ETH a year ago and still both currencies exist and have market value. As another example, original BIP 141 (SF)  was based on BIP9 95% mining majority, and did not happen w/o BIP91 (HF) 80%, and now Core developers declare not to use BIP9 anymore, as the threshold is too high. 
Future bitcoin hardforks are inevitable and they are also a part of Core schedule. Even if 2mb HF will not happen, other planned improvements require HF, like Schnorr Signatures.

No like Hillary. In this case the probability may be accurately computed, provided the  a priori probability of the hashrate distribution, which - on the other hand - is estimated only. I don't know if someone really calculated the 90% figure, but it may be calculated accurately. It is a probability, either, and does not take into account factors like a pool dropping, sudden DDOS, etc. Therefore we must wait until the actual 80% is reached.

I believe, even having Segwit2MB - effectively up to 8 MB block - it will soon become congested, because of so many people wanting to secure their funds in more trusted format. Even if 99% of day to day traffic moves to side channels, the remaining 1% will soon exceed 8MB.

To be honest, NYA is basically a Chinese initiative and the resistance to BIP91 comes mainly from Core  members. Failure of segwit2x and UASF instead, while risking a split, may be welcomed by Core rather than the miners, as potentially advantageous in the long term (smaller blocks, more incentive towards off chain solutions).

If you mean "the probability of minining in less than 3 minutes" compared to e.g. "the probability of minining in less than 30 minutes", it may be the same. I am not sure, but once AntPool is give more time to mine, the odds of other party to mine increase, as well. Not sure if it could be easily computed.

It is not that logarithmic scale should be used exclusively for the Bitcoin. Logarithmic scale is natural for all securities and all other economic measures, like interest rate, GDP. The reason being that - what matters - is what percentage can one make rather than what is the face value. It is only the logarithmic scale that 2 points in time may be easily (visually) compared in terms of the percentage of gains or losses.

It's simple. The OP asks:
- Btc end the year in 4k?
I understand the question as follows:
- Is there any chance that one Bitcoin will be worth 4000 USD at the and of the year 2017?
My best answer is:
- No way! It will not drop to 4000 USD. It means, I expect BTC to rise to $12.784,02 and I do not expect it to drop to less than $10.000,- , and even in the latter case momentarily only.
Simple, isn't it?

To be honest - nobody knows for sure what price of BTC, or any other security, would be in future. Price is always a balance of the market forces, an equilibrium between those who think it will go down and go up. If a market signal comes that causes people believe that price will go up (like recent acceptance of BTC in Japan), the price momentarily moves to a higher equilibrium. This happens because there is enough money on the market that people want to invest if the promise is to make more gains than by buying US bonds. 
More precisely, there is also a risk factor. If I can make only 10% more (not 10 percent points) with BTC than with US bonds, the higher risk of sudden drop may restrain me from investing. If, however, the monthly gains could be a 10-fold or 100-fold of US bonds, I can calculate the risk and assume that - on average - I would gain. 
The so called BTC "hodlers" are more dragon believers than informed investors, not excluding myself. I believe, the price would be $4k at the end of 2017, if scaling issue is NOT resolved. If a solution is agreed, however, and implemented (or on a path to be implemented), the price would probably quickly jump beyond $10k, because so many BTC projects are there ready for launch provided the scaling issue is resolved.
