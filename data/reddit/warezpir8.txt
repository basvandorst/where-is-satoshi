the graphical design of the faux reserve note in and of itself is fairly decent...
but most of the actual meat of the piece is shite as far as what you have written and want people to pay for.
"in code we trust" ?
my imagination is vivid but i'm having a hard time seeing someone pay money for this.  i could see you selling some high quality glossy poster prints at a low price but it would be to people who aren't serious about bitcoin.  there is most assuredly bitcoin art worth $900 to someone with old money in bitcoin, but this isn't it.  
imho its trash.
i'm not trying to hate and at first glance the note looks decent but all the details are fucking cringe.

The issue is that the more successful one gets, the more one thinks that they actually know what they are doing regarding something which moves independently.   Ultimately, getting "pretty good" at day trading means you are a successful guesser.  The people who gave the stock reply "never sell lower than you buy" were looking for "never put more on the exchange than you will be willing to write off as a total loss"

The hashrate probably hasnt been climbing during a bearish market period due to herds of people deciding to turn on current gen miners and break even while the price headed down.  The more logical explanation would seem to be massive amounts of next gen hardware being tested for ~~profit~~  efficiency.  So they are basically already a part of the hash rate is my answer.

lol fellow reddit user.  i'm sorry for hurting your feelings.  
it wasn't meant as a personal attack on you as the artist, you might be a decent enough person.  it was my opinion of the work you shared.  
to answer your question, it helped me reconcile how i felt about seeing poseur level garbage be marketed as something worthy of spending that much money on.  
i don't like it, and its not the "creative" aspect of it.  you shouldn't care if i like it, and you shouldn't be worried abuot me convicing people with $900 to spend on it not to if its worth $900.

They are free to accumulate bitcoin; it would be a wise move by them, and it would pump the price with a network effect when people realized that it was rated as a buy by the chinese government.  However, they want a coin that they birthed, and bitcoin can't help them there.  They would rather make their own coin than learn to manage a supply of bitcoin properly.

my memory is that others have been trying to get them to unlock your account with full proof of identity in hand.  
if the situation is really as you have outlined then your attorney will be the one to get you the results you need, not airing your shit out on reddit.

if everything is exactly as you said then your lawyer bringing legal action against them in the appropriate jurisdiction seems to be the only thing likely to get them to return your funds.
what i did see official binance say was that you arent going to get results out of them via this medium.  
at this point you need to comply with them since they hold your funds.  
if you want to take your funds back by force then you either need to get the law on your side in their jurisdiction via your attorney, or perhaps get out your checkbook and contact ibm x-force red or portcullis at cisco

People of all ages and cultures respond to humour. Most people are able to experience humour—be amused, smile or laugh at something funny—and thus are considered to have a sense of humour. The hypothetical person lacking a sense of humour would likely find the behaviour inducing it to be inexplicable, strange, or even irrational. Though ultimately decided by personal taste, the extent to which a person finds something humorous depends on a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence and context. For example, young children may favour slapstick such as Punch and Judy puppet shows or the Tom and Jerry cartoons, whose physical nature makes it accessible to them. By contrast, more sophisticated forms of humour such as satire require an understanding of its social meaning and context, and thus tend to appeal to a more mature audience.

there seems to be a general lack of understanding about the nature of the threat of a chinese hosted centralization.
if the entire bitcoin blockchain were running on chinese ip space, then their government could very easily shut down bitcoin.
however, since it that isn't the case (and -never- will be with bitcoin) they can feel free to turn off any and all chinese boxes related to the bitcoin mainnet and the bitcoin network would automatically adjust and continue to function as intended.
this is kind of bitcoin 101 folks, its built to withstand china.

some sort of bip where consensus rule would allow such coins to be marked as tainted.  its complicated even if it's safe to say nobody behind bitcoin supports this type of activity directly or indirectly themselves.  if i have concerns about someone's site i can get it blackholed and have their dns pulled and so on.  whether or not bitcoin can include such things raises the issues of central authority and consensus.  it also creates a slippery slope where if this type of feature is incorporated into bitcoin, then some people will feel coins marked for narcotics, prostitution, or gambling should also be tainted.  at that point we would be losing cabin pressure.

in the opinion of the moderators of this space, it is not a safe practice to maintain a bitcoin balance which you do not hold the private keys for. if you are doing this, your coins are not really yours, since the private key is what grants exclusive access to those bitcoins.
in our opinion, no central bitcoin holder is trustworthy. it creates a huge attack surface and a powerful human urge within that entity to steal funds. if it hasnt happened to your exchange, our view would be that it hasn't happened yet.
but people wont read it, or will tell themselves it doesnt apply to them. and then we have to hear from everyone who has to use an exchange, and how unreasonable you're being. you end up splitting hairs. it's ultimately beyond obvious that any funds you send to an exchange could be gone forever. merely broadcasting a bitcoin transaction is somewhat a leap of faith.

One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than ����, where �� is the absolute temperature of the system and ��
is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)
Given that ��=1.38⋅10−16erg/∘Kelvin
, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2∘K, an ideal computer running at 3.2∘K would consume 4.4⋅10−16
ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.
Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21⋅1041
ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7⋅1056 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all of its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2192
. Of course, it wouldn’t have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.
But that’s just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 1051
ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.
These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.

i feel like you're saying bitcoin doesnt have a definition.  that's not correct, and no matter how much you attempt to condescend about it to me, that fact won't change but you will be putting your ignorance on front street..  
like i said, i've identified that there will be no meeting of the minds on this and am walking away from this particular discussion with no embedded hard feelings or likelihood to attach this conversation to your reddit name if it randomly pops up in another conversation.

bitcoin is a huge fucking waste, but you are have made tons on bitcoin.  got in soon after hal finney and will never offer a shred of proof, but sold enough btc near the peak to do most of what you wanted to do.

isnt it beyond a bold move to fraudulently use the bitcoin twitter user against jack and isnt this the perfect time for it to be either quarantined or reclaimed through eminent domain

@_date: 2019-02-07 15:28:07
i'm not looking for an argument but jack is the ceo of twitter and bitcoin cash is not bitcoin.  i don't see what you saying as addressing the fact that the bitcoin handle is being used on his platform which allows for verified user status to push an alternate version of bitcoin.

this certainly isnt an argument in favor of wells fargo or fractional reserve fiat cartel laundry facilities, but all banks have regular scheduled maintenance.  that may not be what this is if its during business hours, but you'll find most banks will have something like an hour of downtime weekly.
most major exchanges couldnt handle the traffic whenever bitcoin hit a new peak during the last bull run, so this in and of itself isnt really much more than a screenshot with a hyperbole driven title.

i feel as if we've reached a philosophical impasse regarding handling of the bitcoin twitter handle
i'm having a hard time imagining  being wielded well by anyone, thus quarantine still seems legitimate to me.
i feel as if twitter would not let someone other than themselves use  and thus there is some line to be drawn.
even if bitcoin is by nature anti branding, it still has a name with a reputation tied to it and there is some break where free speech ends, even if it is arbitrary
i guess you have me on board as far as i dont think it really matters at the end of the day if roger goes on with his finders-keepers-ware shenanigans.  
where we differ is that i would probably put a stop to it if i had the access, and it appears you would take an  approach.  since there is no right claim at all, quarantine feels right.
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:22:19
i'm sure satoshis take on it would be closer to yours than mine.  it just seems to cross past scammy and offensive to a new level when its happening on the platform run by someone endorsing the real brand.  but point made, i wont venture into the twitter world on that mission, and for that i do thank you. edit-typo/spelling

Who says this, and why are you lending them any personal currency?  You lost me at Crypto-Twitter.  There is no such thing.  There are some good people who also have twitter accounts and a bunch of people retweeting content and posing.
Twitter is no less of a cesspool than reddit.  People with any vested interest in bitcoin generally don't promote changing it, but of course there have been some exceptions.
@_date: 2019-02-03 21:53:15
it all depends. i have comcast and they will let me hold onto an ip for quite a while, so a simple restart wont get me a new ip.  
some providers would just boot you offline almost instantly and you'd be back with a new ip.  
but if you found yourself dead in the water you'd likely be able to get back online by requesting a different ip.
edited to add:
i'd say that the risk of an attack that cripples your provider vs simply your connection from running a bitcoin node is not significant, i just meant to say that its likely sooner or later you might get packeted.  i wouldnt expect a sustained campaign against you simply due to running a node.  in my configuration where i have the same ip for a long time, i might find myself needing to request a new ip.  my ip might well be offline through the duration of their campaign while comcast was unaffected.
@_date: 2019-02-07 19:18:46
also lol at presumably op for the downvote, im pretty sure satoshi said the original version of this on bitcointalk
@_date: 2019-02-03 21:12:05
unless you take an ip on this network out on irc already, it would be a reckless assumption to believe that your provider mitigates attacks well. it's certainly possible that one day your netflix could be skipping or internet down because of a bitcoin node at your home.  i wouldn't consider this a significant risk but it does become greater than zero. 
if it ever happens you can change your mac address and get a new ip from your provider and more likely than not things will be fine
other than that you have assumed the responsibility of keeping the software on your node up to date by running one so it would be risky to not stay on top of that
@_date: 2019-02-04 18:56:20
attempting to bump this so it stays on the front page, annoying to see it gain little traction but not terribly surprising
edit: obviously that wasnt going to do anything.  downvoted all medium.com-based posts above it as a parting shot. certainly strange how so many other totally worthless posts have more votes.  could actually be organic data supporting the r/bitcoin hive mindset, but i choose not to believe that.  still, seeing random dumb shit get 1000 votes and this get 75 is kind of odd.

typical bullshit soundbite from some random twitter account. 
"when you think about it" as if i need some random to draw arbitrary conclusions for me so i can agree with them.  
its not incredibly far fetched what he's saying, if it really catches on well the supply scarcity will drive the price pretty hard, but why do we need tweets on here like this

@_date: 2019-02-07 15:47:54
differing view.  in my casual observations of a library, i would be likely to run into something i did find to be good.  similarly on reddit, the bitcoin subreddit is pretty much trash, but there is a lot of other decent specialty stuff centering on reddit.  i dont find that to be the case with twitter.  you can certainly have a different opinion on that which i wouldn't be able to refute since i dont see anything good enough there to make me want to use it more than i do from seeing shared content on various subjects
@_date: 2019-02-02 17:45:41

What is even more interesting is how over US$150m worth of bitcoin ~~passed~~ was laundered through all of these casinos.
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:16:42
Cool heads will prevail, assuming you use a video casino which is actually cryptographically fair and you understand how to play the game you want to win and have some strategy (such as martingale) which you will stick to.
More than anything, take profit when it's there.  For example, if you put in 0.015 BTC and make it to 0.2, you need to cash out 0.1 of that before going further.
I see a lot of posts from people who want to buy BTC near ATH and then sell on the dips, so even with your friendly caveat, people will still foolishly lose their money. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:54:41
It may not be what that poster meant, but in the context of crypto currency, gambling provides a very good way to clean tainted coins which casts a shadow over the industry in a way which has nothing to do with gambling in and of itself as a vice.  I am specifically referring to washing bitcoins, not fiat currency in this context.
@_date: 2017-04-08 11:12:45
If we are calling 150 the total, then yes, it would be something less than the total.  I don't have an actual number on how much is being cleaned and it was hyperbolic of me to present that the total amount is due to this type of movement.  However, if you are going to present a supposition that gambling sites are not being used for this, then we can't talk anymore.

Psychological projection is a defense mechanism people subconsciously employ in order to cope with difficult feelings or emotions. Psychological projection involves projecting undesirable feelings or emotions onto someone else, rather than admitting to or dealing with the unwanted feelings.
During his sessions with patients, Freud noticed that they would sometimes accuse others of having the same feelings they themselves were demonstrating. By engaging in this behavior, the patient was better able to deal with the emotions he or she was experiencing.

So a 5 year longer stake gets paid 2x what a 1 year stake would. If only 1% of coins stake, then they're getting 369% ROI a year. Trustless 3.69% interest pool paid to stakers instead of miners. Emergency (early) unstake pays a 1/2 committed stake length penalty, half of which goes to loyal stakers pool, minimum 9 weeks. SILLY WHALE PENALTY of 50%-75% from 1k to 10k+ coins. (avoidable by splitting up before snapshot.) GoxMeNot: Mt. Gox and a few other undesirables excluded from claiming

if this was you saying the word suicide and hoping someone would toss you 1 btc, lots of luck with that.
suicide is a serious thing, not something you use for leverage or sympathy.  don't make me contact the reddit admins and tell them to do their best to send help.  
if you are getting $280 (per month?) and 1 btc costs over $3000 then there is no shortcut, you can gamble as a trader or at the casino, or you can get a better paying job.
avoid buying really cheap coins you've never heard of on the idea they might some day be big. they wont. that's the only advice i have other than work out how to bring in more money. you're trying to balance an equation here.

Ministry of Margin Trading is a group of active margin trading traders who invest own money using advanced sophisticated strategies. We spend on the computers 10-12 hours waiting for a great market opportunity, trading mostly at Bitmex exchange.
On this website prepared full guide starter for beginners and advanced how to begin trading at BitMex. In this interview between beginner and MinistryOfMarginTrading. We explain where a key is to make profits at Bitmex. The most important is not to lose deposits, avoid liquidation and learn how to properly use Bitmex platform.
**1st step is understanding Bitmex and what you are doing.**
We explained millions of times what liquidation at Bitmex is and how to avoid it. Traders don’t have time to read it. Trader’s greed is so enormous that they are losing money at Bitmex in a stupid way. Being liquidated means that you lose much more money that you should. All you must do is to set up stop loss order much more before liquidation price by mark price. Easy? Yes, but every minute at Bitmex somebody is being REKT.
The next common Bitmex mistake is opening to a big quantity of XBT contracts comparing to your deposit (cost) using x50 or x100 leverage. Margin trading at Bitmex in our review is amazing but you cannot do so simply mistakes.  
**The last step is to use the weakness of other Bitmex traders to win when they are losing.**  
Do it! You don’t have to earn every single day at Bitmex. We are happy to have 4 days in a week when we earn +100% investing aggressively. 4 x $1000 – 3 x 1000$ = $1000 weekly. It is not millions, but it is every week. You don’t have predict price to earn at Bitmex – we explain more during our Webinars.

it is all about motivation.
it's not easy anywhere.  i'm not saying that you are not disadvantaged because i dont know your situation, but it woudlnt be easier in the usa if you were making minimum wage.  if minimum wage is your rut, then you need to get 2 or 3 jobs and be working 7 days a week.
even for the people who have yet to meet the computer they cant control at a low level, people who have fluency in binary assembler and convert hex in their head, their money that they earn at their job doesn't come "easy" simply because tasks that are difficult for you and i are not for them.
some people are really happy at their jobs and love what they do, but it doesn't mean that its easy to do a good job, just that it's worth it for them.

the price is awful if you got in at 20k for a coin and are now looking at $7000 in your account, but in this case, yes, it is trite, but remember its not $7000, it is 1 btc (or whatever, round numbers).  you bought it either to gamble with or buy drugs, in which case it is awful b/c now you can do way less of those, or to hold and see the moon with, in which case its not awful, we just arent there yet.  i dont think anyone here can seriously with a straight non troll face on say that they believe that btc is dead and on its way down to $0.  
if it had gone straight up and was sitting at 50k now, would you happily take your profit, or gamble on it continuing to 100k?
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:08:04

@_date: 2018-04-01 17:09:17
if i were to tell you definitely sell when (if) we see 25k, then most likely that would not end up being the ceiling.  sell whenever you will be able to realize profits that seem worthwhile to you, unless circumstances make it necessary to sell sooner.  i was forced to sell 6 btc at $1200 per coin a year ago, and i got to see it move to $3000 a month or two later.  with 20/20 hindsight i would have made alternative payment arrangements and come out way ahead.  obviously i would have only sold [edit: typo] one coin and held the other 5, and then sold at the exact peak in december.  /s 
if you expect btc to hit 100k then dont sell at 25k and dont be sad when it crashes again before getting there.  it goes without saying that there are no guarantees of any future performance here.  its possible that btc can become entirely devalued, but we are using a proven hash function for security and the likelihood is rather slim.  if future hpc clusters start to come knocking, the hashing would be changed.  if the underlying crypto is somehow broken where keys are reversed and raided wholesale then the security of the internet as a whole has failed and the value of 1btc is no longer a top concern (which is "good" since it would be devalued).  thankfully most people who are of the defacement persuasion rather than the profit mindset are not skilled enough to be able to begin to contemplate reversing a hash function which was purpose-built to not be reversible via quick and dirty cheats.  def never underestimate the right ninja strike force, but do take some comfort in knowing that they would want btc to be worth as much money as possible if they spent the ridiculous amount of time and development resources to be able to move it at will.

the narrative is that they will push it as low as possible, buy as many coins as possible and then obviously it needs to be pumped so they can actually make fiat profit money, since the narrative is that they dont want to hold bitcoin. meanwhile everyone else sees it go to 25k and says, its surely going to at least 50 or 100 this time, moon/lambo real soon now, and holds the bag for them.

my bad then.
if someone hacked overstock.com, records of the bitcoin transactions would be worthless, but if they gained access to any btc overstock is holding they would have the opportunity to get away cleanly with transactional currency worth $$$ which nobody can ever reclaim from them other than by local use of force.  to get away with money is the end game, and bitcoin is thegame changer.  when someone steals billions from a bank, it goes to another bank, and is eventually reclaimed.  bitcoin is very much the holy grail for a hacker who seeks to profit from his talents in this regard.
re: infos and cc, its not very valuable to anyone, hardly a treasure trove when the bitcoin is on the table.  
anything worth owning was owned a long time ago (along with all the stuff not worth owning).  everyones info is floating around in the ether regardless of if it's ever been publicly disclosed or not.

if the fud narrative that big money is shorting bitcoin to death is true, then i dont know why people think there is support at any level above about $1000-$2000 per coin.  if its that type of big money performing calculated dumps, the actual market to prop up the price at any given level is nonexistent.  whales are whales from 2013, they are not going to hope to add to that stack propping up the price at $4000 per coin and regardless of if they did, their fiat input would not offset calculated dumps such as the ones being suggested. if the narrative is true the dumps would increase to absorb these inputs.

@_date: 2017-07-17 07:24:04
for an online merchant, having no possibility for chargebacks is a major feature.   credit card fraud is a huge issue for any retailer, it's not as much of a non-issue as you think just because the payment is instant.  payments are reversed plus fees all day long.  nobody who accepts credit cards is happy when their customer has a card instead of cash, trust me on this.  i am agreeing with you that bitcoin is, as i said, still rather beta for everyday use.

nothing is wrong with coinbase.  
they have a reputation of enforcing their TOS when it's required.  it doesn't mean they auto-enforce all of their policies, but they will auto-enforce as necessary to remain compliant when external complaints arise.  
they aren't on your side regardless of your history with them if someone else complains and it's a policy violation.  
many banks will give you a more favorable resolution opportunity than account closure if you have a good transaction history with them, but not all major banks are customer friendly.
as far as this poll, i'm not sure why i'd want to let someone else know my spending limits on coinbase and store that info.  for the record i deeply respect luke and greg.

anyone reading what you're saying who actually deals with credit in a business is probably thinking damn, even if i wanted to side with this guy, he has no leg to stand on
you are making yourself look foolish.  credit is an expensive and very slow way to get paid.  bitcoin is very fast and cheap by comparison.

he would have to be aware of the risks.  that would mean that he decided by going forward that the risks were worth it to him.  it sounds like he probably valued money more than you do.
at  the end he may well have been thinking "it wasn't worth it" but he could have also been thinking "i knew this might happen sooner or later but it was totally worth it and i would make the same choices a second time".

if they stored their funds with the trust of a 3rd party, its quite likely that they could be seized from their online wallet.
escaping that, it's possible that they could still be stopped as they brought funds into circulation for liquidation if they were "on the radar".  however they would probably be making p2p trades.
if they were operating in the us, they'd realistically need to be in the $100,000 to $250,000 range for the fbi to do more than think about opening a file.  i would guess once they get into about the $1,000,000 range in the us, its a good case for a young agent.
since they are ripping off total idiots, its not likely that they will face a lot of real blowback that has any teeth.  in other countries the local concerns would be far less.

@_date: 2017-07-05 00:15:48
you'll accumulate btc but you had to buy the miner, so thats why you wont get your money back.  especially if you don't have free power.  you know you can google stuff like how to build an ethereum mining rig, correct?  someone who is going to be successful at this stuff is not making their first stop on reddit to ask such basic questions.

almost any portable device looks better than this for every day utility.  i'd rather have any random tablet or small laptop than this device.  the game controls really add to the comical nature, to me.  its kind of a unique ultra portable but the cases where this would be the ideal device seem limited, to me.  happy birthday and sorry to thread crap, in general we (I) should be supportive of anyone who is behind bitcoin.

If you're asking, is bitcoin priced to reflect all of the bitcoin in existence -- its price is simply a reflection of the markets where it is transacted.  You bought it because someone was willing to sell it.  They were willing to sell it because you wanted to buy it.
Right now there is still plenty of bitcoin to go around.  It's finite, but it's not yet scarce.  Enthusiasm driven ATH's won't affect that, but widespread mass adoption would.  With widespread mass adoption comes our so-called moon.

hi and sorry for the smart-alecky reply i gave above, that's just me.
it seems like you needed to vent -- don't overthink this one.  bitmain doesn't care about your business.  the whole resale deal is just gravy to them.  the miner already paid for itself before they put it up for sale.
plus as you mentioned, they already have a long list of people wanting to send them large amounts of bitcoin.

it's a bad idea to use coinbase's standard so-called "bitcoin wallet" as your primary storage, regardless of if there is any kind of chain split.  however if it's an amount of money that you'd feel comfortable leaving in a paypal account, then it's ultimately similar risk and depends on what you're comfortable with.
all you have to do "to take bitcoin from your coinbase account in a safe way" is to send them somewhere else that you control and own entirely.
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:53:39

maybe $100/mo if you pay for power or $300/mo with free power, as things stand now.  but if you have to ask on here, i would recommend against buying one.  its not likely that an s9 will pay for itself at this point.  if you have no idea about this stuff and you come to reddit looking for help, i would like to help you by suggesting you do not buy an s9.

even supposing he eventually provides proper cryptographic proof or moves the coins, that doesn't prove he is satoshi.  to this observer, his social methodology pretty much proves he isn't.  
i could be wrong, and i consider you a respected contributor, and i'm not trying to troll you or your thread.
even if i was able to obtain all the necessary documents to prove that i'm you, my problem in proving it will always be that i'm not actually you.  real proof has not been made.  real proof is not refutable.
