Thanks!

Of course we are concerned . Millions of people are storing hundreds of thousands of coins with them. If they can't even keep our names secure, why should we trust them with our coins?

Hermel, you are exctly right. This is the point we need to hammer home, in each country. Force it beyond your borders and you have no control.

Just remember, when we live in a freer, less authoritarian world - that it was build with sweat, arrests and efforts of "a bunch of white dudes".

Sigh is not a very convincing retort. Here, have a sigh, on me.

Maybe (this is a wild theory, but hear me out), maybe people notice problems with other services and then propose an alternative they have had good experience with? Maybe they even do it because they want to help the community?
Am I way offbase here guys? 
Nah, its probably the Rothchilds. They own Kraken.

This one is for the bitcoin archives. When the next big revolution happens people will point to stuff like this and say - see, shit was weird when bitcoin was just getting started too.

Lame. Truly lives up to his namesake. 
"In fact, I never intended to..."

Great description.

And isn't it ironic... 
Accusation of FUD that is speculative and unsubstantiated.
...don't you think?

Yes, you have 60 days to do this - if you did it from your personal account. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 09:13:06
This is bizarre. How could this NOT be a scam? 
@_date: 2017-01-30 10:46:46
Yes, this seems very much t be the case. Perhaps they are subsidizing with investor funds.

How could Iranians buy Bitcoin if they wanted to?

Thanks but the commission they charge is often not small. Additionally, the quantities available are quite small. Many do not have above $500 in inventory.

It says it is Bitcoin

Aksid's scariest moment: being run down by a chicken. We need an AMA.

Oh. So that's where the name for Mt. Gox comes from! Crazy.

This image is the kind of thing that could get the media saying that Bitcoin is used in trafficking women.

Thanks! My first tip!

I find all the above dubious:
1) Nonsense, it is easy to turn cash into Bitcoins with services like Bitinstant. And anyone who has a (non-american) bank account is essentially making the purchase anonymously through exchanges. 
2) People whose professional activity is illegal need to be highly sophisticated in how they handle money anyway. In comparision BTC should be easy to handle. 
3) See  
Its not like Liberty Reserve was easier to use. 
Does anyone know anyone who actually operates in these grey/black professions? Whats up?

The deal may actually be a huge boost to Bitcoin. A key feature of the bailout deal are severe capital controls.*
These are likely to be in place for a long time. Bitcoin becomes a very attractive way to transfer money.

Not to mention that the wait time is a fee in itself. Time is money.

This is a really interesting question that the article almost completely fails to address. Many thought that the black/grey market would leap on BTC. It is so liquid, crosses borders so easily and is is unregulated. Except for the very geeky Silk Road, this didn't happen. Once, perhaps it was possible to think that maybe people just hasn't heard about BTC. But by now, that is clearly no longer the case. So why is it, the the "underworld" has not adopted Bitcoin?

"Only" - 1% is a great deal, and it gets worse the more you purchase. Are there any flat rates out there?

Dude, not three lines later, he shows why this can't be true. If I were you, it would worry me that my group-think hat was twisted on so hard, that I can't even handle someone describing what other people think.

Coinbase rates are also often far above market.
