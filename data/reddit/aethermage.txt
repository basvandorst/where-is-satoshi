cafe on my street is already using their cards.
I'm the only that pays in bitcoin there tho. we need to get more folks supporting these merchants for this to work!

CoinPunk and Kyle are pretty damn awesome. this is a project the world needs! Go Kyle. I started to install it and the instructions were super easy even for a linux newbie.! awesome.
Checkout getCoinCafe.com for a web wallet for newbies. super simple and user friendly. Apple can't ban it either.

@_date: 2014-10-28 11:53:14
read about this a while ago... makes sense now but it still seems like you will have to mention bitcoin sometime down the line, like right before u show them how to accept it, no ?

a fall back makes sense. 
did they keep the bitcoin or convert to fiat??
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:56:15

considering the best we've seen yet is a pita sandwich once a week. i think $500 is pretty awesome.
@_date: 2014-10-23 19:21:07
the simpler way is at the end. nice! i see alot of street merchants and folks in 3rd world countries using the 0 click cards. no smart phone and net is a big plus, we need simpler and simpler ways to use bitcoins. normal folks don't care about hd wallets etc..
keep on

thanks Adam!!!

I use them at my smokeshop. super easy. they have a web pos that looks like square but i just prefer to point to a card i printed out and wait for an sms. works.
I just use my old iphone4s that i have there with the easybtiz qr code glued to the back.

Closing the circle is the hard part as the media will keep spinning tall tales but if we focus on a single community at a time we can do it. then Bitcoin will be a real alternative currency, no fiat needed, thus true financial Independence.

not into therapy. 
but I will def pass this guy onto my fam in SF they ALL go to therapy once a week. They seem perfectly cool to me, seemed they never needed it or maybe the big city made em stressed and the therapy helped. whatever. good to see docs embracing bitcoin and hopefully keeping it!

if someone is gonna go thru the trouble to make sure some dude doesn't get his cup of coffee then humanity has bigger problems.

how is this spam? did you read the article? this is good stuff. seriously who let the trolls out of buttcoin ?
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:28:51
yeah, that makes alot of sense. pretty cool too. I am leading Hoboken... I am the only one tho.. lol
This can be pretty powerful if we all get behind this. Will try signing up the bars along the strip tonight. Got a solid crew of Bitcoiners here , we can prob conquer the east coast!
Hoboken powa!
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:13:32
you've uncovered the conspiracy of our times... congrats brah.
@_date: 2014-10-13 23:06:39
just awesome!
Smiled when I saw this. Will def support these guys and be checkin' the map. 
how exactly do we signup a merchant? just tell them to go to your site?
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:19:08
if you want to help bitcoin on the street try easybitz.com
their map shows merchants getting bitcoin in realtime so we know whose actually taking it.
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:50:20
good articles trying to make the bitcoin ecosystem more secure are a GOOD thing. seriously.
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:05:48
The cross site forgery part needs expanding. You gotta update that line in the nginx conf every time you add a css, js file from any outside source. Like if u add Zopim chat or a new js script loaded from google, you must put those domains in the nginx conf else it will break the script and possibly other stuff.
Really good list over all. We should not be shy sharing security tips. Bitcoin worlds should be LEADING the way here not hiding.

Scanned Electrum 2.4 multisig xpubkeys, but still shows balance as 0 in Samourai.
Also wanted to xpubkeys from import Multibit HD, but in Multibit where the pubkey is located? Wallet is multisig, using Windows.
