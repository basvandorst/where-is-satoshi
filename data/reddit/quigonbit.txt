They wouldn't have to do that would they? This sounds like a modified version of what Brazil did with the Real to fight hyper-inflation. As long as the Greek citizens accept the "digi-drachma's" value and they're able to pay for their rent, groceries, etc. then it can just be mined like normal. If they "print" then the currency will be worthless.

Ah yes. . . the ol' Greek method.

I feel like most individual consumers and small shops like that are really just "participating" in Bitcoin rather than relying/trusting on it.

VCs and PEs don't invest in currencies they invest in companies.

I think the next logical step is for Coinbase to do a simultaneous buy/sell on both sides of the transaction for any Coinbase controlled addresses. That eliminates the risk for both parties and enables some very quick and easy cross currency payments. They'd be taking a spread on both sides of the payment so they stand to make quite a bit of money from it.

That's true, fair enough, so I'll add that *generally* they don't invest in currencies or speculate in currency markets. Looks like this particular purchase is for the purposes of an ETF though, which doesn't make it a bet on the currency itself but an investment to develop a product.

You're right. It seems he doesn't know anything about how "traditional" payments are settled let alone Bitcoin payments. I think the traditional banking system is bottle-necking Bitcoin though. Companies ultimately want to repatriate their coins back into their local currency (until BTC completes it's world domination). The flow is slowed down significantly because of it. For example a typical intl payment:
1. USD to BTC  (a 3-5 day settlement, identifying documentation required if in the U.S. KYC/AML bullshit)
2. BTC to BTC payment (10min avg.)
3. BTC to EUR (another 3-5 day settlement, not familiar with European rules regarding KYC I'm sure they have some)
As much as it pains me to say it, the way Bitcoin is today, companies and individuals are running a lot of risk during that USD/BTC or EUR/BTC settlement. That's a lot of days that they're without their cash. They're also subjecting themselves to the fluctuation in BTC during that time. But it's NOT because of Bitcoin itself, it's because of the damn banks' and their outdated systems take too long to get my USD over to places like Coinbase, Circle, etc. so they can give me my Satoshis.

Ah yes... The 'Gild/Price Indicator' is a great technical tool in the arsenal of any self-respecting bitcoin trader.

Not to mention the whole article is sensationalist bullshit. Bitcoin is going to destroy financial institutions? How exactly? Even if the entire world adopted Bitcoin and it is the sole operating currency of Earth, how will they become "redundant?" Will they suddenly stop lending, underwriting IPOs, manage assets, provide structures, etc? Replace USD or EUR with BTC and it's business as usual less some fee income.
We need to be much more pragmatic as a community and see beyond our own echo chamber. These type of statements show me that banks still don't understand what Bitcoin is; and community members that eat this shit up understand even less about finance.

I agree, I'm not suggesting anyone give up on it at all but the entire economic scenario in Europe is filled with hypothetical situations and possible outcomes all at the mercy of incompetent politicians. Those same politicians could legislate some roadblocks for Bitcoin and it definitely has me concerned.

Sorry if stupid question but how is it stored in the BTC blockchain if BTC transactions is the only information on that blockchain?

I love Iceland it's really a great country.. Damn expensive but the people are great. 
However, remember that Iceland has a reputation for being a front for Russian money laundering so this makes me think a little about their motives.

If Bitcoin is going to be mainstream it needs all the noobs it can get and they shouldn't be worrying about the status of their transactions. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 14:55:27
No. 
You take on risk and it will almost always end up costing you more.
Let's say everything (including both USD/BTC exchanges) take place over the course of that hour, which it doesn't if you're converting USD, you're still paying 1% to get in, a transaction fee, and 1% to get out. Doesn't seem very cheap to me. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 19:59:14
Spreads taken by an exchange are not market-driven. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 20:20:26
You want to buy BTC from Coinbase and the market for BTCUSD is at 600 on the offer. When you execute to buy from the exchange, your rate with them is 606, the exchange keeps that $6 difference. No matter where the market is, your rate is going to be 1% worse than market. It's just a simple spread and they'll do it on both sides of the transaction. This is how they make money.

I'm not sure what the graphic is trying to tell me. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 14:48:12
Absolutely right. These BTC companies have to work through banks if they want to accommodate fiat transactions via BTC and those costs are passed on to the consumer and then some. 
In a perfect world all transactions would be BTC to BTC but the reality is, any exchange from x currency to y currency is going to be expensive.

I don't think they're a systemic problem at all but Iceland isn't exempt from unethical bankers or politicians. Their financial crisis showed that. Greed moves faster than idealism and unfortunately BTC attracts a lot of very motivated bad actors. When I see "good" news like this (government embracing BTC), I try to think about what's really motivating the push so I tend to be more pessimistic. I still think the story and the goal of BTC is great though so I'll keep using it and pushing it.
I don't see how DB's payout decisions are even remotely relevant to laundering or Greece's debt crisis. It's literally just how they're going to pay their employees.
If you're talking about Iceland jailing the bankers responsible for their crisis then yes that was great. I wish other countries would do that as well. 
I don't know what's going to happen to the current system. I'd love to know so I don't get screwed.
