My son did. He’s a fucking genius. I’m glad I didn’t pull out, if you know what I mean.

I bought Moelis &amp; Co because I thought it was Mastercard (similar ticker). Happily working out okay so far.

0/10 low quality post.

I'm buying BTGC, but only a little.

Well there is a ton of bitcoin (and shitcoin) ads on every train, which seems like it could be a problem. People might be taken for a ride.

I see the that sign often, it's indicative that Japan needs to have tighter advertising rules,

Diversify. This is speculation. I bought some, made some money for laughs, got out. If you hold 5% of your net worth it’d be ok but don’t be greedy or foolish and hold more.

So they still have wonderful Big Ben’s Meat Pies there?

Yes my son and I got into it just to learn the technology and mechanics. He was frogging genius, had the vision to get out at $17k. I was amazed at his wisdom. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:08:13
Good point, I wish you good luck! Remember not to get too attached to an investment though, you should never have more than five or 10% of your net worth in any single vehicle.

Right. More reasons why studying psychology is one of the most useful things you can do. When 2009 happened I knew the forward momentum of every economic actor in the stock and housing markets would cause things to return to normal very soon, and they did.

The bile here is so predictable. I feel sorry for you guys, but it was always going to end this way.

Hate to say it but in stocks, at least, when there’s a sell off in, say, Disney, the people who buy it later will be new buyers, not the people who sold (and presumably have anger over taking losses). That’s what I learned from my stock guy, before I fired him for talking me out of buying AMZN at $399.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:47:02
Why would it ever go to $100k? The minute x people get back to $0 or a small profit there’d be selling pressure again.
@_date: 2018-06-10 03:15:05
Is that the currency conversion thing? The trick is to do the conversions n in the same currency and convert later.
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:34:56
If you for our at $17000. My son did, and I got out at 12k.

Before BTC went up when stocks went down. What is happening to that today? Might be working a little, but not a sure thing.
Do NOT have more than 10% of your net worth in something batty like BTC. Spread things around more.

I love reading these silly posts. It’s the crypto version of WSB.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:28:13
That was due to it not being on the futures market yet, plus the mass of interest created through 24/7 media coverage about Bitcoin. Now that there’s almost zero coverage interest has fallen again. You could almost track media buzz against BTC and get a near perfect relationship.
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:07:36
But how high? Because when others get back to break even they will sell.
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:27:02
Right. I made some money I could lose, had some fun, learned about the mechanics of the tech. My son made a bit more, enough that he had to pay major taxes, which was a good lesson for him. People who cling to the notion that the dollar will be valueless in two weeks and bitcoin is the future are self-deluding.
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:34:18
Maybe, maybe not. But there are certain investing axioms you can generally trust. One is that people who exit an investment (like me in oil in 2014) don’t return to it, and when the next rise comes, it will be “new blood” for the most part. So you can think about people who maybe made a loss. Will they get back in? And in 1 year, will some new coin have gotten actual critical mass? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:30:40
Congratulations! I hope you learn how to hold onto it and make it grow, perhaps slowly. Also, don’t tell friends or family about the money, they will just try to get it out of you.

Today I bought viagra with bitcoin, which seemed like a 2017 thing to do. And next year I plan to start accepting it for my business, since I’m here in Japan.

Meh, we've all been there. I came across a Paypal booth at a convention in [whenever right before their IPO was] and raved about what a great company I thought it was. I got a call the next day asking if I wanted to invest in their IPO but I turned it down. Looking back, I am pretty sure a then-unknown Elon Musk was standing there at the booth, listening to me.

I have a house I expect to close in like a month, so I've got tons of money coming from that. I have a margin account set up and ready to go, so I can buy now then pay it off when the house closes. Would I be crazy to do that, or not to do that?

No one here will listen to you.

So the $30,000 question is, when the fork happens BTC is likely to fall some,  I will be looking to buy since I want an entry point. What ballpark figure would experienced folks here guess it could fall to? $5200? $4500? Any sense of how resistant BTC has been to downward pressure would be great.

I am in Japan and I had no trouble getting an account. You have documentation like a US  drivers license?
