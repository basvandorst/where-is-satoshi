I see your point, but it's all about the tone of the post. TBH, if I was in Greece I'd be pretty offended by this post.


Doesn't cut it for me. Bitcoin is not a magic bullet; it will bring hundreds of problems with it, even if your claim is that this burden will be less than the one this country is already suffering from.

It's pretty clear that this an attempt to exploit (and maybe smirk at) someone else's suffering. Bitcoin is not a corporation; we are an open source project.

Your Reddit birthday.
@_date: 2015-06-29 07:25:18
That makes a lot of sense thanks! I always thought not reusing addresses was just a privacy thing but if I understand what you're saying - everytime I send from an address, the wallet uses the private key to find the public key which is then made public via the transaction.
Thanks for the tip and have a nice day!

Buttcoin troll here. FWIW, I like Gavin and Maxwell and admire and respect what they do. I think Bitcoin (the protocol) is a beautiful idea.
What I hate (AKA mining comedy gold) is the community that can't take the slightest criticism of Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin at best will only be a strong niche currency.
If you can't take criticism (while building an 'open' protocol), you're Bitcoin's biggest enemy not us.

Seriously, makes no sense. Unless 21 Inc. has made some sort of a breakthrough in chip design, which Balaji's post doesn't say.

Which is a very real possibility and has been known since day 1. This is where the exchanges come in, who will try to economically cripple the "other" chain.

And how many full nodes are necessary?? 20, 50 or a 100? See my point? The only people that matter apart from the miners are exchanges. And thus any hard fork can be successfully pulled off provided a sufficient number of miners and exchanges agree.
@_date: 2016-06-01 16:12:19
They definitely have a big advantage, which is why most pools practice SPV mining. The only answer to your "what if" is that if most miners started mining such blocks exclusively, the price would crash and their mined bitcoins would be worthless.
But yeah, in the long term, definitely something that needs to be fixed.
@_date: 2016-06-02 05:46:59

With the present fee rates that would take several decades. Unless the artificial fee market catches up; we'll see.
@_date: 2016-06-01 17:14:37
No it doesn't. The possibility of rogue pools is low only because mining is heavily centralized. But we must prepare for bad actors in a free market. The tx fee won't stop them for decades unless we see a drastic fee rise.


@_date: 2015-08-29 08:13:53

@_date: 2015-07-11 18:15:42
Yes, I know. As the network is crowded ATM (and will be in the near future), the pools have a duty to use the max. block size of 1 MB.
Just look into their history, all of their max size blocks are 0.7 MB.

I don't get that either. Plus if most pools do SPV mining we might have a problem anyway.
I guess these are desperate times for Blockstream; the community is slowly losing patience with sidechains...

No pool wants to raise the block size because of a greater risk of creating orphan blocks. They have to be publicly shamed into it.
@_date: 2015-07-12 05:12:11
Wow, awesome! I guess I was a little too harsh...

@_date: 2015-04-28 15:36:23
I agree with the general thrust of the article but you conveniently sidestep two critical questions:
a) How do users buy their bitcoin in the first place? By going through banks like Coinbase. The regulators are not stupid; they've figured out that you can't attack a p2p network outright. What you can do, is to use the traditional systems to deny people access to this p2p system. They'll certainly pursue this approach in any and all regulatory models.
b) What comprises 99% of financial transactions? Are they questionable? I doubt that. People want to buy stuff of of Amazon, they want to send their pal $100 through PayPal. These comprise the heavy majority of users of payment systems and banks are happy to let their txns through. Infact, banks would be bad businesses if they didn't allow everyday, average txns to go through. (And as we know, banks are some of the most successful businesses in existence; they know what their customers want).

Didn't happen either. Newton did not have the mathematical tools (vector calculus), using which an undergrad today can prove this in a few lines. He had to actually use a really hair-brained argument - first to prove that an entire planet could be treated as a mass point at the planet's center and then to show that the orbits would be elliptical.
Halley, an astronomer, actually shilled Newton intensely to publish the proof. Thereafter, it took Newton several years to find a satisfactory proof. It didn't just happen like that.

Everyone knows it can never be 1 due to SPV mining. And because some small fish like Elgius still use different soft limits. 
But good of you to go around claiming, "Blocks aren't full because the average size still isn't 1, guys!!!".
@_date: 2016-07-04 15:30:38
Yes. There is a reason something is priced $1.99 rather that $2. Flatly calling it a 2 MB increase is much more attractive.

Some questions then:
The crux of your argument is that since bitcoin isn't really used by ordinary users today, it won't suffer from any downsides brought about by user inconvenience. The evidence offered is:


which is misleading. When exchanges move large sums into/out of cold wallets, it inevitably pushes the average to the higher side. Also while most bitcoin is used for speculation, it doesn't prove that most bitcoin transactions are trading related. In fact, because an average trading txn will have several times more value than an average retail txn, the correlation goes the other way. I'd like to see the median bitcoin transaction in terms of value.


  &gt;  dramatic numbers tell us that increasing the block size alone is a non-starter as a long-term plan for scaling bitcoin.
No one is asking for an unlimited increase.


And when will the average bitcoin user be able to use them? Not just talking about an implementation, but a means for no-nonsense use by an ordinary user. We don't want another RBF do we?
