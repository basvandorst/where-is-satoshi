Something similar happened to me with Coinbase, which for me turns out to be a robbery.
Here my case:
I bought 30 ETH at 81.53 $ on May 3, 2017 in total were 2,482.32 $ including the Fees, I received the confirmation of the purchase and debit in my Bank of America account, and the message indicating that my ETH would be arriving at the end of Day on May 12, 2017.
It arrived on May 12 and I did not receive my ETH, I let them spend 2 more days and I still did not receive it, so I sent an email to support seeking a solution, which did not respond until after 10 emails and 10 days later without any Response that were overloaded and that they would be working on some solution.
After being actively persistent in my communications with them, on May 26, 2017 they replied that they had had unprecedented demand and had made a mistake with the purchase of my ETH, so they would be making the refund in 2-3 weeks.
After completing the date they told me they did not return my money, since then I have sent infinite emails, DM on Twitter, Twit  and  and they simply stopped responding and today after almost 3 months they have not returned my money.
Note the following:
1) My COINBASE account has more than 3 years active and I have bought and sold many times Bitcoins and Ethereum.
2) I have all the tests, coinbase response emails, screen shots of my purchase with the indicated dates and all the evidence to support my case.
There are already many cases I have read here on Reddit and other Blogs like Error in the purchase, block without reason, freezing of money that all end up can only be called "theft" by COINBASE, it is important that the new Crypto-users Know and take their forecasts, and all those who have passed us join forces for COINDESK to make an article by publishing our cases.
Coindesk.com now has a section in the bottom right that says: "have abreaking story -&gt; Let's us know here
For my part, I agree to join in to get a COINBASE response and get our money back. Twit me or DM in
