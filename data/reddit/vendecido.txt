Happened to me on Thursday night, they withdraw all my bitcoin litecoin a fun etherium in a matter of minutes, contacted coinbase but haven't heard from them yet, weird thing is that next day gdaxibtc.com does redirect to real coinbase website but today in the morning it redirected me to phishing site again. So what the deal ? Does gdaxibtc.com belongs to coinbase and they are being hacked ??? Hopefully coinbase claims responsabitity and we get the money back !!

that sucks, they make so much money but really bad customer service. I guess there is nothing to do just keep waiting.
