Nice. That is almost 4.5 BTC, no? (1 BTC = 100,000,000 satoshi)
What is your fee rate at?

Yes, definitely, and I spotted that too, but considering how much volume comes out of Asia and too a lesser extent Europe, I have serious doubts this stands. Please correct if I am mistaken.

This info is from 2013 and/or from a coindesk survey. Not current or broad. Granted, could still hold relatively true. I have particular doubts about the 53% American stat now.

It doesn't matter how much you own if you believe it will keep going up.

We should just ask Joe Rogan to coordinate it, connect the two.

Trezor has been good to me. Everywhere I read, everyone seems to like one or the other for small reasons, but respects/trusts both.

"metaphorical piece of wet trash" there are poets everywhere. Thanks for posting.

This is sound advice worth seriously considering. Sell a portion of your crypto, reinvest in dividends (and maybe some real estate). 
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:43:17
Got a similar warning. Not cool. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 15:56:20
Will this reduce block times or transaction costs? Thank you.
@_date: 2019-08-22 09:23:39
The blog posts kill me. Bless everyone trying though. We all are.
Edit: some blog posts are really epic, e.g. [ETH goes bloom; blowing up Ethereum's bloom filters](

Thanks. I have visited it a bit, but is has usually seemed to be more of the same.

Good creates good. Evil destroys itself.

that's a strong limb.

I like Unchained quite a bit. Was looking for print media too. Thanks.

Liked how he liked his own joke.
@_date: 2019-08-22 09:23:13
Actually looks pretty good. Thanks for sharing.

Interesting behavioral-economics perspective on purchasing Godl.

Auditing is whitehat hacking. Seems like a good idea, no? I think OP is just saying that enthusiasm should not subvert skepticism and proactivity.

Is channel creation permission-less? Can I just hook up with any public channel I want to? Thank you, if you have a moment to respond.

Isn't the idea though, from a *Homo economicus*, game-theoretical POV, that it can be profitable – many very low-priced tx accumulate satoshi and compensate the most reliable and effective nodes?
@_date: 2019-02-25 17:54:03
Trouble is I think many people are willing to operate at a no-profit or net-negative rate, as it seems electricity costs are very low and people are willing to eat that to participate. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 23:15:49
Do either you or have stats on this? That way it can be settled. Thanks.  
@_date: 2017-04-17 17:23:55
Do you think Ethereum will consume some of its utility value as/if smart contracts and Ethereum-based apps become more prevalent? Or will that only bolster BC utility? (Kind of a noobie in the crypto space, so thanks for reading) 
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:50:36
How long will the last 100 blocks or so take? In other words, what is the timeline if it does lock in this period? Thank you.
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:45:14
awesome thanks.

How are you planning on holding both, if I may ask for advice? I do not run a node — is there a way to hold both without a node? Thanks.

Will August 1st be a time to tell? I was just looking at the Segwit singalibg percentage and it was still below 50%.

Is there realistically a chance that Bitcoin hardforks? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:56:46
Thank you for responding. This article — [Trezor and Ledger Will Support BCC]( — is leading me to move all coins to my Trezor. It says that following the fork, BCC coins will automatically be added to an address within the hardware wallet.

I am more ETH and ERC20 oriented these days, but respect bitcoin and am really enjoying the conversation on this post. 


Is this not inevitable given the consensus mechanism of bitcoin? In other words: is there any way to prevent change in a system that can be changed via a majority of the people using it (i.e. miners)? 
The position regarding increasing bitcoin transaction fees being a positive reflection of bitcoin's position as a scarce asset and therefore fit for large transactions, and the necessity of addressing scaling issues, and whether these are issues or not, is also thought-provoking. Thank you for sharing. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 13:01:27
Agreed. What is good for Bitcoin? I just cannot see how a split in the chain could be a good thing. And isn't transaction speed (that is, backlog) an issue in need of solving? So doesn't that require some sort of update? 
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:50:03
Things like sharding and PoS should help Ethereum scale. Technically, it is a real challenge obviously.

Is there a possibility that everyone just gets on board for 2MB blocks and avoids a legitimate split?
