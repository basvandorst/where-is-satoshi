It's better to say that they gave us a meaning of the word journalism without any journalists and journals 
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:26:33
Me too. This article made my day.
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:40:02
Haven't heard about this conference before. I'd like to read more info about it.
@_date: 2014-08-24 09:16:05
How do you know? 
@_date: 2014-07-19 12:59:28
Neil Armstrong would be proud of you, sir
@_date: 2014-08-31 15:36:52
I spel it "Sah-toe-she"
@_date: 2014-07-15 14:50:41
If i'm not mistaken, in the USA, terrorists can get some money only because of untracked bitcoins. So in my opinion it is good that French regulators tried to limit bitcoin anonymity. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 13:53:56
What kind of words are you actually using?
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:10:47
That's something new to  BTC subreddit
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:38:09
Never and never again.
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:06:18
He is a cyber Neil Armstrong
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:09:11
I want. Maybe someday I'll do it.
@_date: 2014-07-31 08:39:02
Ooh, i see what you did there, Mr. Wales.
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:33:47
I imagine there will be a low of spam on this thread, but here you go.
I first heard about bitcoin several years ago while reading about silk road. I visited the site and learned that they only accept bitcoin (at the time this was Huh to me). Reading more about it I saw that Ross/DPR would guarantee the fiat value of bitcoin in the event of a dispute with a vendor (and a refund was processed) or at least they gave the option for this. I believe this was back in 2011. Unfortunately I did not do any additional research as to how bitcoin works nor how to mine bitcoin at this time. 
I read about both Silk Road and bitcoin probably at least 10-15 times from then to mid to late 2013 when I finally decided to get more "into" bitcoin and purchased some at higher levels then the market is showing now.

Bangladesh is not about accepting but it's quite nice that citizens are informed about bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:04:04
Who the floral customers are? Are they crazy about bitcoins or what?
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:48:31
Since now we can't say that BTC is independent
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:08:35


The news-letter sounds like they are scams
@_date: 2014-08-24 09:16:24
Coffe and poking... what a weird combination
@_date: 2014-07-31 08:45:13
BitPay's plans always sounds excititng. But they never becomes true 
@_date: 2014-08-31 15:41:12
Are you guys just repeating after each other? 
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:10:26
Coin*prism*... sounds like NSA project.
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:40:40
Everyone should start acquaintance with BTC from FAQ.
@_date: 2014-08-31 15:37:59
What you want to see in the Bitcoin subreddit? Don't you want to read something great about BTC inventor? 
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:45:41


How many of it still alive? Not more than ten?
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:49:39
Be honest - 20% is too much.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:09:55
And what are you waiting for? Explore this ATM! 
@_date: 2014-07-19 12:57:52
nobody can explain that. Just because nobody have enough information for telling the truth.
But i like jokes about Bitcoins and the Moon
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:02:21
Imo the only Trojan that can hurt the Bitcoin is not the horse. It is a programm
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:18:20
Sad, but it doesn't work in this way. Banking regulations even does not sounds like "profit for BTC users"
@_date: 2014-07-19 12:58:24
Do you remember the time when billions in bonuses were collected?
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:11:12
After this words he begann to accept Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:15:04
Yeah so that's why people will think that Bitcoins are dangerous
@_date: 2014-08-31 15:40:51
There is nothing wrong. BTC-e is crazy as it was be year ago 
@_date: 2014-07-22 13:53:52
I'm sorry but I do not undersand what's "crypto needs" means. Would you explain?
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:14:25
The idea is so funny that nothing can earn "best comment" achievment except yours.
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:32:53
0.6 btc is not a bad amount for this effort..! Although I missed it on tv but I'm sure it wasn't on screen for more than 2second. Just wait for the day when someone related to Bitcoin will sponsor those events.
@_date: 2014-07-15 13:17:34
haha! very good btc video in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:33:19
That's what I was thinking. Haters moan at this, but you send bitcoin and the person receives them almost instantly, so this isn't an issue.
@_date: 2014-07-15 12:07:06
Five-year investment plan? Looks like Bitcoin curve will never fall down!
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:38:56
Maybe he is not a very far-sighted businessman. Who knows?
@_date: 2014-08-31 15:41:50
People have a big problem with their patient skill
@_date: 2014-08-31 15:37:23
Thanks you sir
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:09:31
Pretty big bunch of Bitcoins ATM, isn't it? 
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:05:45
Because it's a first days. Wait some more and you will see what happen
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:04:20
God bless the Dell!
@_date: 2014-07-22 13:53:43
True. But the fact is BTC doesn't need timeless art. It needs very attractive ad which will bring more people here. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:09:11
What? I thought that we have freedom of speech here, in BTC community
@_date: 2014-08-24 09:18:16
And now we are force the world to use a currecny which didn't issued by a central bank. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:08:48
Who knows? Maybe 
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:12:13
Why did you decide that bitcoins are blue? 
@_date: 2014-07-22 13:55:30
I actually agree with you. Category of attractiveness should be the first thing what we are worrying about.
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:16:18
So after this i'll read a book with a name "That's How I Became Famous."
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:46:41
Very good example with Ford. And I agree that Bitcoin is not a car.
@_date: 2014-07-19 12:57:02
Can i say that Dell's CEO is kinda Bitcoin God?
@_date: 2014-07-19 12:58:55
Haha! Use bitcoins as a salary - what a great idea!
@_date: 2014-07-31 09:00:02
That's how american democracy works 
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:11:56
Sounds awkward. Hope that BTC community can get over it. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 08:54:20
The fact that you need to give my physical address to donate sounds ridiculous i know but that will help government to screw some terrorists 
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:36:06


The most appropriate word here. Discussion is obsolete.
@_date: 2014-08-24 09:16:25
That's called a Bitcoin economy, I believe. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:08:35
UK is about to lend on the Moon surface! Good job! 
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:10:15
Scams don't like when someone want to show the world their nature
@_date: 2014-07-15 14:13:17
very impressive analytics! Bitcoin is more popular than "fiat" and "fiat" is more popular, than "dacia". That's mean that bitcoin is more popular than "dacia" (Romanian car manufacturer). Quite logical!
@_date: 2014-08-24 09:18:19
Your diagrams look nice. It gave us a real picture of how it's going
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:50:15


Lol, but you have a point. Movies like jobs about Apple can give people some feeling that they know how to make a dream but in fact, a lot of people who starts in their own garage - failed
@_date: 2014-08-31 15:37:13
And what should we do with that symbol? 
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:31:36
I completely agree.
Many people don't see or care about the advantages of bitcoin, and don't look into it.
I also think many people don't realize the flaws of fiat. Maybe because they are not hurt enough by it, or do not realize most of their financial trouble is caused by fiat itself.
This realization needs to spread.
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:05:25
You can try. Who knows, maybe it will let you to earn more Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:10:26
Yes, even coinfire. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:48:07
That's how US governemnt turned Bitcoin into a tool
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:19:29
How janitors can regulate Bitcoins? I can't understand it, except the case in which Satoshi is a janitor.
@_date: 2014-07-31 08:53:31
So now you should pay them a couple of bitcoins
@_date: 2014-08-31 15:38:03
Who is the guy on a photo? Maybe it's a real Satoshi? 
@_date: 2014-08-23 14:44:16
This article is very harmonious and well written.
@_date: 2014-07-19 13:04:44
That is why i've installed Ubuntu on my notebook
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:50:04
Yes, maybe they should use display for showing us actual price everyday.
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:16:40


And what are you going to do? Any ideas? 
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:47:36
Yoda Rodger Ver??
How come Rodger Ver gets to be Yoda?
Come on!
