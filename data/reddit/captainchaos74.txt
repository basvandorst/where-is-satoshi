Like others have said: there is an Android and an iPhone app. But also the algorithm is described on the site and you can download source code and a command line tool to regenerate your card if the site ever goes down.
The seed is actually [a-f,0-9]{16} ;-) You're not supposed to remember it, the idea is to store it somewhere safe so that you can retrieve it if you lose your card.

Sorry, didn't see you there. I'm new to this reddit thing.
I have a pathological and irrational hatred of Windows, so I'm unlikely to write a Windows phone app. Plus, you probably need Windows to write apps for Windows phones (just like you need Mac OS to write apps for the iPhone, which is why I didn't write that app either). But if someone is willing to write one, I'll link to it!

That sounds like he did actually generate new signatures for the BBC. One wonders why he wouldn't just publish one publicly though. Perhaps he somehow pulled the wool over the eyes of the reporters.
