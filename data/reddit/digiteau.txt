Everyone. Calm the fuck down. If you don’t want your trading activity to be collected and sold, then switch to a broker that would be happy to charge you on your trades. But do you really want to pay those standard fucking fees on your trades? 
I don’t care who buys the info about my trade. People already share their trading activity on social media. I’m perfectly happy to have access to, especially, free options trading. Avoiding trading fees has been much more beneficial to me than fearing who sees my trades.

But doesn’t this mean that bitcoin will still be prone to collapse in an economic crisis if it adopted as a major currency?

Is Bitcoin Core the essential blockchain database for Bitcoin? And if it is, how is Bitcoin considered decentralized if the blockchain requires developers to maintain the software that verifies transactions?

No. If bitcoin becomes the primary source of monetary value after another big financial crisis, then financial crisis will still happen after but with bitcoin. At the end of the day, firms need to finance their deals with some sort of money.  And periods of too many deals falling apart will always happen.

I don’t know what makes people think Bitcoin is a savior. I agree with the criticism of government and the corruption it can bring. But Bitcojn isn’t going to do shit to stop it.

Exactly. I mean, Bitcoin is already being taxed.

War would still be financed by those who have strong economic interest in it. Bitcoin would just be another means of payment. 
I can see the money supply argument as more valid. But Bitcoin will reach a point where its money supply remain constant. That would cause issues with the velocity of money. Inflation rates would become volatile.

I don’t know why we trust these coins anymore. Things will just go back to how they have always been. The government watching all of us and the banks charging everyone. Crypto failed.

Talk about a hype to pump up bitcoin prices.

I reply. I upvote. I wish everyone good fortune. May Bitcoin live long!
