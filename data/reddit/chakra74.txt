I'm holding a few alt coins on Cryptsy from a long time ago.  I went to go withdraw them when I heard of the problems Cryptsy was having.  I go to log in and my account is locked because of inactivity, and I've been playing email tag for weeks just trying to log in.

I called it BIP 248 because that's what Jeff Garzick coined it during his presentation.  
I thought an upgrade suggested by Adam Back mixed with the future possibility of increasing data by 4x with SW might be a descent compromise between the "factions". 
Even 2MB with Cisco's 18 percent number, would almost fit your every subsidy halving scenario.  Being a fairly modest yearly increase, it might prevent needing to hard fork again in the future, and with SW keep the scaling steep enough to satisfy big block supporters.

If decentralization ever became a problem, there's hundreds of thousands of investors who have a stake in this experiment.  The cost of running a 20 MB node is negligible compared to our investments.  This guarantees through self motivation that centralization simply CANNOT happen with 20 MB block sizes.

JEFF GARZIK  -- quote --
SW mitigates this - only after several months - only assuming robust adoption rates by up-layer ecosystem software, and - only assuming transaction volume growth is flat or sub-linear
Those conditions must go as planned to fulfill "SW kicked the can" -- a lot of if's.

Most of us had an unspoken understanding that Bitcoin wouldn't start feeling strong fee pressure for many years to come.  The block reward plus fees were put in place so the network would be able to grow substantially before fees alone would support the miners.  We are no where close to that moment. 
Many people in the bitcoin community feel very betrayed by recent developments and the refusal to scale bitcoin the way most of us expected.  This proposal is modest, but at least addresses a lot of concerns many people have.  It will let us come back together as one community and show the world that a hard fork can be executed, and that bitcoin does have a future.

What we need is a time line and a plan.  People who invest in Bitcoin and its future need explicit information and not vague promises.
I want to see a joint statement signed by all the core developers that have commit access. 
Something along these lines.  We are going to have SW done and deployed by March 1st, 2016.  We are going to increase the blocksize to 2MB on June 1st, 2016, and it is going to scale by 19 percent annually.

Bitcoin is a proven engine. We all trust it everyday when we place our wealth and time into it.  Right now this engine has a governor on it. There's nothing wrong with the technology, there's just artificial limits placed on it. We need to allow this proven technology to flourish and grow.
Why would we want to use centralized services to do more off chain?  That defeats the purpose of Bitcoin in the first place.
Bitcoin has something very profound. It has the element of self interest and the promise of change. I have a stake in Bitcoin, just like hundreds of thousands of other people and I would never allow it to fail if my efforts could save it. 
Would we really let this fail because of the cost of running a node?
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:13:18
The block reward does not change the difficulty.  It's the pay out or incentive for the miners to continue mining while the network builds.
All this bitter fighting and animosity within the community could all come to a rest this weekend if people would just compromise and all pledge support to this new proposal.  Lets all accept this olive branch and start working together.   
If we could get a response from all the core developers and important players in the community right here and now, maybe we can put this behind us.

What you're saying is true but many countries have made future promises that exceed their income in the future.   Imagine you had expenses that exceeded your total income with no way to increase your income by more than 2 percent annually.  Now you're sitting on a mortgage on top of all that, and worse, it's at almost 0 percent interest rates now, and could raise in the future.
That's one of the reasons the USA is in a much worse situation on that top debt list than it appears.

Okay 10 years ago might be a bit of an exaggeration on the upload bandwidth but certainly not on download.  If anything that just proves how far we have come in the last 10 years.   
Everyone seems to be dodging the fact that we won't hit 20 MB for many years and that the new maximum is only a hard limit.  The miners are going to set the soft limits to what they will accept. 
We could set the new block limit to 1000 MB and the only thing it would change is how large a malicious miner can make a block.  
There's so much hyperbole going on here from obstinate detractors.

I sometimes wonder if the banks are considering going with a fully pre-minded proof of stake blockchain.  They could give each bank branch a stake and then try to promote the blockchain and sell their new currency.
They can claim it's backed by the bank and fully insured, and then go about promoting it for being perfectly open, visible and immutable.  
It won't have the iron clad decentralization of Bitcoin or the backing of proof of work, but most people won't know the difference because they've been pumping them up about this new "blockchain" technology.
I hope I'm wrong, since there's already a perfectly secure blockchain already.

When you play the lotto you'll spend your whole life trying to guess 6 numbers with a range of 1 to 49.  You'll most likely never guess the right 6 numbers even once.  That's 49x48x47x46x45x44 possibilities.
Now consider a private key address where each character has 62 possibilities.  62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x62x6262x62x62x62x62
Trust me when I tell you that the possibilities are truly endless.  The number of private addresses is so absolutely large that you'll never stumble upon the same address twice unless you know how the original private key was generated. 
If everyone on the planet generated thousands of addresses it would still take all the computers on the planet thousands of years to guess one of them.

Brain wallets are bad because everyone in the world can be working to detect your pass phrase, while with BIP 38 only the people who actively have your encrypted private key can try.
More importantly it is much less time consuming to "test" a brain wallet password than a BIP 38 password.  BIP 38 uses a very complex decrypting process so it takes a ton of processing power to try to decrypt every password.  So in the time someone tests thousands of brain wallet passwords they might only get to test one possible combination with a BIP 38 password.
Because of the length of time it takes to decrypt BIP 38, even a moderately complex password that would be hacked as a brain wallet, could be secure for lifetimes with BIP 38.

Yep, basically.  And every few years the pay out is halved.  So right now the miners are all solving their puzzle for 25 coin payouts every 10-15 minutes on average, and in a year or two, they'll be doing the same calculations for 12.5, and then 6.25, 3 or 4 years after that.
As the hashing power increases, the puzzle (or missing bits) increases making it more difficult to solve.  It looks at the computational power available and sets the difficulty so on average it should take around 10 minutes to solve.  
So the more miners fighting for their share of bitcoins, the more difficult it gets and the more it costs in power to "find" them.
If the cost of power exceeds the price to mine bitcoin though, eventually the hashing power will go down as miners turn their rigs off, until it becomes profitable again.

Like all gift cards you would purchase it with your local currency.  You would then have that much local currency loaded onto your gift card.  You then proceed to log onto a webpage and redeem the gift card for bitcoin at the exchange rate.

When I was younger I worked with a guy that got a lump sum of money from an insurance claim.  Like you I assume he didn't want to live the life of a wage slave.
He ended up purchasing a 5 bedroom house right beside a college and lived in one room and rented the other 4 out to college students.   Since he didn't owe anything on his house he had the flexibility to never feeling stuck in a shitty job like many of us go through.
The fact that you're only 22 years old with such a large head start means that if you're creative, you can live a much lower stress life as long as you're not trying to live the 2 cars and big house American dream.
I would continue to invest in bitcoin, but I wouldn't go overboard with it.  If bitcoin does become a success, you won't need hundreds of them to be successful.  
I sometimes believe that there's no middle ground with bitcoin.  It's either going to wither or catch.  If it catches, the long term prospects could be intense.  If it goes that route, even owning 50 of them will be a nice pot.
Do a lot of soul searching and brain storming.  You have enough resources already to set yourself up on easy street for life as long as your eyes don't get too big.  If you're willing to move, there's a lot of places where you can live very cheaply.
Good luck.

There's a very good chance you have a keylogger on your system.  Even if you run malware and virus protection they sometimes slip through.  What I do is I type in all my sensitive passwords in a small free on screen keyboard that scrambles the information called Neo's SafeKeys.  
Sure there's more complex programs out there for password maintenance but I like the simplicity of Neo's SafeKeys.  Plus it's free, so why not?
If you're not using injection mode in it, no keylogger has ever broken it as far as I'm aware.  If you are using injection mode then some keyloggers will know what you typed.  I very rarely have to use injection mode with it to enter the information into a password field though, so 100 percent secure.

I personally made 10 BIP38 wallets on one sheet and printed 5 copies out and then got them laminated.  I then handed 2 out of the 5 pages to family in case of fire.
BIP38 password cracking is much more difficult than people in this thread are telling you.  With a brain wallet you can test thousands of passwords a second, but that's not how it works with BIP38.  On a crummy old laptop I have sitting here it can take 30 seconds just to decrypt 1 BIP38 password.   Even on high end systems you won't be trying hundreds or even dozens a second.
I picked a password and told my wife and children, and that's it.  So in case I die they can retrieve the money.
If you made a BIP38 wallet and just made your password, "I walked to the store today to buy bread.".  You could hand it out to everyone you know and they'd probably never crack it.

If you're talking about a store of value, even in a large continental event your bitcoins would be safe.  The chances of power going out everywhere in the world at once is almost impossible.  
People are even talking about storing the blockchain in satellites.  As long as even a few miners in the whole world stay up the entire blockchain is still safe.
A situation where the entire world lost power at the same time would be an extremely unlikely scenario.  Even in this event the minute the power came back up, so would the blockchain.  
People are just grasping at straws trying to defend golds position.  As time goes by, people will slowly come to the realization that bitcoin is gold 2.0.

Networks will scale over time, just like any other technology.  They might not double every year, but we certainly will see scaling that allows for orders of magnitude more than today. 
You do realize that in the future, all the miners in the world will have to run their operations on transaction fees alone right?  Do you really believe that we could support all the miners in the world on 1mb blocks?
I wouldn't even dare to calculate how much the fees would have to be at that time to support such a low amount of transactions.  
Nobody prefers a hard fork, and I agree that it's not the smoothest thing but I believe that at some point it has to be increased to something more reasonable anyhow.  Even with protocols built upon the blockchain, 1mb is still way too low even if it's used just for settlements.
 
I don't disagree with most of what you're saying, but bitcoin needs this hard fork to buy it the time to develop the technologies and protocols it requires.  I believe we would eventually have to increase this cap anyhow and that's much easier to do now, than in the future when bitcoin is much larger.

Hello there tydeesigns.  As a fellow Canadian let me provide the links to what I've used.
This site charges a premium, but it allows you to buy a small amount of bitcoins every day with no sign ups or identification.  You just need to pay with interac through your Canadian bank.
If you want to set up accounts we have two major bitcoin exchanges here in Canada.  With each there will be a verification process so it might take a few days to get a level of acceptance in order to trade, but it's not too difficult.
and 
Best of luck!

The sheer amount of press and understanding the world would gain about bitcoin from this would be profound also.  People would understand the value in bitcoin when they realized how much better and open this donation method is.
People would ask questions like, how can they be sending money directly to a person in Africa like that?  If we can send money this way so cheaply now, why do we let anyone go poor at all?  How much would it cost to send a small amount to everyone with this technology?"

Why would I pay 5 dollars and have to wait 3-5 days for my money, when I can use Interac and have access to my trade almost instantly for less at Quadriga.  I really do want the option to use cavirtex, but they simply don't have their priorities set up for real time trading for the average user.
I don't like parking my money on an exchange, or having it in limbo for a week.  With Interac you can send the money and in the same day get it completely off an exchange.

We're dealing with a decentralized system and the only way anything like this can get done is if someone steps up first and proposes a change. 
Polling has shown that a vast majority of people agree that the block size needs to be increased.

It was Vault of Satoshi, but they just announced they are shutting down in February.  
Since Vault of Satoshi is closing I've looked at the fees for interac deposit at Cavirtex and the other large exchange Quadriga.  Cavirtex charges over 20 dollars just to do a deposit with them through interact, even though I've been only playing $2.50 with Vault of Satoshi for the last year.
Quadriga carges 1.5 percent of the interac deposit which works better for me.  I usually purchase around 300 dollars worth at a time, so the $4.50 charge with Quadriga kills the Cavirtex charge.
If you're only purchasing very small amounts of bitcoin and don't mind higher fees, quickbt.com is very fast and easy and doesn't require any registration.  Just so you know both Cavirtex and Quardriga will require photo id's and other information to use their services.

Like walloon pointed out though, it's permissionless innovation.  Not only that there's not a lot of on-ramps into Bitcoin and very few that give someone an on-ramp without directly looking for one.  So far this is as close to business to business bitcoin transactions we have.
People learning about Bitcoin for the first time often have to go through cumbersome steps to try to receive them.  In this case, you can donate bitcoin and they can directly purchase something with them online.  This in my opinion gives people an idea of what it will be like when Bitcoin has its very own economy.

The simple answer is there will be no KYC at all in the future.  Sure these bankers don't want to hear that, but that's a part of the revolution we're experiencing.  People will simply exchange bitcoin for local currency on each side, and most of those people will ignore the laws.  Send bitcoin to a person in India for almost free, walk up to a machine and cash out for a couple percent.  Good bye remittance market.

I'm worried because we all assumed that when the time came bitcoin would scale.   I honestly believed that they would just increase the block size since that's what was planned all along.  Simple yet obvious solution.
Instead I'm seeing endless criticism and a lot of developers holding back progress.  If there is a huge push for decentralized block chains and bitcoin isn't ready, people will find ones that are.  It's way too early in the cryptocurrency space to be relying on high fees to support your network.  There's lots of alternatives that will gladly take the business if bitcoin fails to deliver.
@_date: 2015-07-31 01:24:17
You do need a little space in your upload bandwidth for downloads to function properly, since you need confirmation packets.  In a situation like that you have to use software to limit the total upload bandwidth that particular application can use.  
Even if you set it up so the node could only use 75KB out of your 125KB upload bandwidth, you would most likely not notice any difference in your everyday use, and the node would run just fine.
There's ways of doing it with hardware too, if you are running your node on a separate computer.  I understand where you're coming from though, and in some situations it takes some fiddling around to get it to work properly, and sometimes it's more work than many people are willing to commit to.

Where did I say that Ripple stood a chance?  I mentioned 3 currencies that have solved a problem that bitcoin is currently experiencing.  I was showing that there's competition waiting to take bitcoins place if it falters. 
Out of all the competing products Ripple is the least like bitcoin, and I didn't even mention it in the original post directly.  
I don't want to discuss the snowballs chance in hell Ripple has of replacing bitcoin.  You're trying to put words into my mouth.
@_date: 2015-07-07 15:38:24
I agree with you.  It is way more likely bitcoin will succeed.  As problems aren't solved though, the chances decrease.  You'd be crazy to bet against bitcoin right now, exactly because of network effect, but don't overestimate it and think you can sit on your hands and the competition won't fight for their share.
Remember, some of these "shit coins" have more network effect than bitcoin had a few years ago.  In a dynamic world, things can change quickly. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:26:48
You won't find any proof of stake lovers in this reddit.  Regarding your question though, I'm actually surprised no one has tried to pull something like this off yet.
Why not import the bitcoin block chain into all kinds of new coins?  It's certainly possible and it would likely catch the attention of hundreds of thousands of people who would have some stake in your project without even asking for it.
You would run the risk of people just liquidating their coins for whatever they can get for them.  I think that scenario is better than trying to figure out how to fairly distribute coins like in the case of a pre-mined though.

In the context of this situation, I think he made the right decision.  If you have a large government entity looking directly at your project, it's probably in your best interest to talk to them directly instead of some third party who might not represent you properly.
Some people might take that last sentence out of context and try to paint Gavin as some government loving anti-libertarian but that's not what I believe he meant.  
If you try to sell Bitcoin to them as a public good, and a new revolutionary technology for payments and savings, instead of focusing on some of its anarchist beginnings you could help these agencies understand that Bitcoin isn't their enemy.
I believe he was just being a good diplomat.

If you look at the scaling in this proposal, it would mean grinding against the hard limits for many years to come.
The pressure is already being felt, so we need to first open the pressure relief valve, and then let it scale.  You can't build a new scaling system on top of one that's already straining.
This scaling will only work properly if the growth from the first 6 years of bitcoins life is taken into account.  Starting with a base of at least 2mb, would help.

The initial bump-up before scaling is of fundamental importance when discussing any kind of scaling.  Pieter's proposal is modest, and I'm totally on board with the scaling percentages.  
If his proposal was to initially jump to 2mb instead of starting with 1mb, he might of got a lot more traction from both sides of this debate.  
If you look at the scaling in this proposal, it would mean grinding against the hard limits for many years to come.  We'd still be under 2mb at the end of 2020.
The pressure is already being felt, so we need to first reduce the pressure, by making a modest one time jump and then let it scale. You can't build a new scaling system on top of one that's already straining.

You know how it is.  Markets are irrational.  I'm more of a hodler.  If I sold today, it would probably double in price in the next month.
I am a big believer in Bitcoin, and spend time discussing and explaining it to a lot of people.  I'm just stating that for the first time I'm worried.  I'm invested for ideological reasons too, and I don't plan on selling my investments but supporting the network.

If your internet connection will allow you to upload at 1Mbps, you can easily run a node.  With a lot of providers the big issue comes with the total bandwidth you would use for a month.
I just checked the rates at my provider, and I currently have a cap of 300 gigs a month, but if I pay 10 more dollars it would go to 450 gigs.  For 30 more dollars the cap is increased to 800 gigs.  
If the block size was increased to 8mb and we mysteriously hit that cap right away and stayed there, I might have to pay 30 extra dollars a month.  I'm fine with that though, since I want to support the bitcoin network, and that price is small compared to my investments in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-30 02:30:12
People always talk about the risk of centralization due to block size, but the more one thinks about this subject, the more one realizes that it's almost total bullshit.
There are over 4000 cities on this planet with a population over 100,000 people.  Every one of those cities would have the infrastructure for high bandwidth applications, whether it was personal or just for businesses.   Imagine a world where bitcoin becomes a success with hundreds of millions of people using it.  What's the chances of there not being at least one club, person or business that would run a node per city of that size?
Now is 4000 nodes across the whole planet not decentralized enough?  Do we really believe a city like New York would only have one node in it?  
I think the answers to these questions are obvious.
@_date: 2015-07-31 04:47:43
Color me impressed.  I've been reading about the progress you guys were making here and there, and really wasn't expecting anything of this caliber.

@_date: 2015-07-30 16:01:27
While most of us want an increase in block size we can all agree on, I think the base value in this case is too small.  
4.4 percent increases starting next year every 97 days would not allow enough scaling at the start of this curve.  Using this formula we'd only be at 1.18 MB at the first part of 2018.  
I do think the scaling would work if the base value at the beginning of this change was set higher to take into account all the growth from the last few years.  Starting at 2mb (or higher) would seem more reasonable.
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:20:31
I think most of this reply is very disingenuous, especially the last paragraph. If Core did compromise and released an upgrade path most of the community would agree with, it would have almost no chance of failure and all this fighting would be history. To suggest that Core has no influence or power to bring the community together in this situation is wrong, and I think everyone involved knows that.
Why would you also attack other fellow Bitcoin promoters in this reply when we're all just trying to do the best we can for Bitcoin from our perspective.  That goes against the spirit of the original message.  If we found some common ground, all of us could join together instead of fighting each other and work on expanding the Bitcoin network again.
To suggest that Bitcoin has some special decentralization and that people would alter basic parameters of Bitcoin like the total coin supply is also very misleading.

I've always wondered what the exact reply was going to be when I asked why all the other Crypto-Currencies hard fork on a regular basis but Bitcoin doesn't.  At least Nullc gave me a reply to that question, and I'm honestly happy he tried to at least explain that, even if I completely disagree with him.
I believe a modest permanent scaling solution with Blocksize along with Segwit would have such unanimous support by everyone, that there would be almost zero chance of any splitting of the Bitcoin community and network.

The only reason there is so much vitriol towards you here is because anyone that agrees with you has already been banned or censored.

This is the single biggest roadblock to any kind of increased adoption.  Who knows what kind of plans were or will be cancelled before they even start if the developers question whether the network can even handle it.  
How can Wall Street even think about becoming seriously involved in Bitcoin with these abysmally low transaction caps?  Bitcoin cannot move forward until this is changed, and I look forward to that day.  On that day I will truly celebrate.

Good write up. I believe that people overestimate the network effect once a system starts to break down.
People will probably even start to see wallets that allow for multiple digital currencies and when they see the fee structures and how easily these wallets can move money between currencies, a lot of people will have their "Ah ha!" moments.
Of course if they just raise the block size, this would probably be avoided.
The current core programmers might go down in history as missing the biggest opportunity of all time. They'll be judged poorly and be set as an example for all future generations. I hope this isn't true though, since I'd rather see this succeed the first time.

Whenever a miner solves a block he is rewarded the creation of newly minted bitcoins.  The amount of bitcoins that are rewarded is halved every 420,000 blocks.  
This little hand on the clock is basically counting down the blocks until the reward will be halved from 25 bitcoins to 12.5.  
The minute hand is counting the time to the next difficulty adjustment.  Every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks) the difficulty of the puzzle the miners solve is adjusted (To get the time to solve close to 10 mintues again).

To give you an idea, it costs 190 dollars for 10 insets in Canada, yet the exact same product in the states can be purchased for 100 dollars, and sometimes even cheaper.

Due to the small size of the bitcoin market, I think there's a lot of profit that can be made by volatility by large players.  If the price moves quickly in either direction it creates great arbitrage opportunities for the big fish.   Then there's also the people who are shorting the market.
It would be nice to see some of the volatility on the upside instead of this slow but steady slope we've been experiencing for the last year and a bit.
Once it's too difficult to quickly move the markets down with manipulation because of walls and support levels, maybe we'll see more in the other direction?
