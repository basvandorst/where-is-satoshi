As long as you're paying taxes on it, the IRS couldn't care less where it came from.

I’d wager quite a bit that Trump didn’t write this. The stream of thought across multiple teeets is too coherent.

That is not at all how supply and demand works.

It means people were buying bitcoin in $1,000,000+ chunks at a time.

Hank Johnson is not a senator, he's a member of congress - but yes, he's legitimately stupid.

I mean where in the checkout process on Newegg.com is paying with bitcoin presented as a selectable payment method?
@_date: 2019-11-29 04:08:05
How did you pay with Bitcoin? Only options I’m seeing are credit card, Apple Pay, or PayPal.
@_date: 2019-11-30 22:42:34
I figured it out - mobile app doesn't support it. Desktop browser only.
@_date: 2018-10-29 00:38:27
Both of which come with their own inherent relatively large fees. That’s entirely the point of using Bitcoin instead.

That isn’t the case here - trying to buy an item that says sold and shipped by newegg.
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:36:54
 It's probably a bot.

It isn't a trade-off at all. In a data center, removing hot air is much more important than importing cold air. With good insulation and proper heat management, the difference in cooling requirements based on location is negligible.

Right. So when can I buy one of his cars with Bitcoin? Because there's definitely a Model S on my moon.

I’m not talking about Bitcoin’s value. I’m saying if Musk is so positive toward Bitcoin then I should be able to buy a Tesla without needing to exchange Bitcoin for fiat first.
@_date: 2019-10-26 04:59:58
There is an anon post on 4chan that’s been on the mark all year so far. If BTC hits 16k in October as predicted then their prediction remains 100% accurate. That’s why everyone is talking about 16k by the end of the month.
@_date: 2019-08-31 02:34:21


And right there you show a fundamental misunderstanding about the function of insulation. It's not just for keeping warm air in. It's also for keeping warm air out.

One Bitcoin is worth about $10,000. I know this because people are paying $10,000 for one Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:40:51
Yes. People as a combined sum lost $64m in one hour because they bet against Bitcoin.

I remembered this comment and came back just to say: You called it. :)

That is assuming a market supply that could handle that buy. I doubt there are enough cumulative sell orders across all exchanges to fulfill a $44b USD buy.
@_date: 2019-04-14 22:51:12
That’s fair!
@_date: 2019-04-14 21:37:11
This right here. Hoping for a healthy $2500 bottom.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:55:44
I'm just saying this is quite early given the trend for the bull runs that precede halvings. I don't think we've seen the bottom of this trough.
@_date: 2019-04-10 09:28:47
Holy shit there's a lot of bitter neckbeards in here. Congrats OP, you landed on your moon.
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:21:32
Congrats, your order filled lol
@_date: 2019-04-15 00:09:21
Every month for me, steady buys. I have some special funds reserved for sub $3k though.
@_date: 2019-04-03 16:03:03
I'm... okay with that.
@_date: 2019-04-14 22:49:13
I disagree. Healthy means Bitcoin has reduced its percentage of moon kids and FOMO investors who would just as soon throw their money into pyramid schemes. Bitcoin is healthy when it attracts attention for what it enables its users to accomplish - not when it’s all eyes on the rising price.

Oh the average user is thinking plenty. It's just that the average user's thoughts are incredibly confused because the average user is insurmountably stupid.

The seller converted to fiat, not the buyer. The house was indeed purchased with Bitcoin. If the seller wants to immediately exchange BTC for USD, well then that's their prerogative.

You're right when you say Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places. You're very wrong when you say it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:59:38

Computers as we know them have existed for less than a hundred years. To say that SHA2, which has existed for 18 years, will remain unassailable for the next 900 years is pants-on-head insane.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:35:41
Then I will regret not selling near 20k again.

There is absolutely no guarantee that $7000 will be worth tomorrow let alone next year. But if you pay off the car today it’s going to stay payed off. Here’s what you do: buy enough BTC to be a member of the 21 million club, then dump everything else into paying off your debt. If Bitcoin accomplishes everything it set out to do, 1 BTC will be enough for anyone to retire and live off of in ten years anyway. Might as well enjoy the wait debt free.

I don’t think anyone here believes this is doing anything. Not even (most of) those who are participating. It’s for the lulz.
