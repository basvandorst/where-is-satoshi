Since when is 15k cheap lol

Your parents are correct... Bitcoin is nothing but a ponzi and will be blowing up soon.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:10:31
^ 
Buys BTC at 20k USDT and screams HODL at every turn.
Believes the incompetent core devs are "the best devs eva and lives in a bubble".
Denies that BTC has been pumped by chucky cheese tokens and tries to scam the average joe out of real money.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:37:59
The "best devs in the world" have been working on it for several years now with absolutely nothing to show for it. 
I'm only here because a number of you rbitcoiner's can't seem to stay in your lane.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:36:45
Surely if Bitfinex can print tokens out of thin air... so can I ;) i'll be sure to sort out the legalese to ensure that it's not redeemable lol seems to be working just fine for them.

I'm not the one getting paid and raising millions in venture capital sponsored by the banking cabal.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:14:49
It's certainly "succeeding" with rising transaction fees and increased comfirmation times. More like dead in the water.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:53:32
Correction... The Cashening thank you. Do you really need my 0.1 BTC that desperately? I thought you've been "buying the dip" all along. Ran out of money?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:32:07
Tell you what... if you accept carwash tokens, we've got a deal ;)

Leave him be... He was fed a lie and can't bare to face the truth. Let him sink with the Titanic.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:43:31
I'll think of buying when it gets back to $10... don't mind waiting till 2018. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:52:15
Simple really... best example of greater fool theory at play. If they convince enough "greater fools" to HODL... they can still cash out while those fools are left with the bag.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:00:47
You speak using your brain?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:17:02
I hope you've sync'd that alert  to the tether printing press... they'll be printing 100mil chucky cheese tokens a day to keep pumping your coin lol.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:13:16
Lmao... and here I thought you just had a mental handicap. Now I know it's pure delusions. Stop tripping on LSD (no it's not a crypto)... I heard it's not good for your health.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:40:09
You'll have to run that by me again... I haven't seen that altcoin you mentioned in the markets yet. Perhaps they are still launching the ICO.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:39:59
Oh I believe what i'm saying but I won't be getting scammed by you nor Bitfinex. I'm sure you'll find "a greater fool" on rbitcoin to give you free money.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:15:37
Be sure to let Bitfinex know with their coordinated Tether BTC pumps ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:39:06
Ponzi confirmed mate... these HODL'ers are delusional and going down with the Titanic. Charlie was trying to give these idiots a heads up but clearly it went over their heads.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:32:49
Bitcoin will end up like MySpace... Irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:45:27
That's because they are relying on the fraudulent tether pumps to bail them out.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:23:00
^ Believes that mcap actually represents real dollars in the market lol you always this retarded?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:57:48
Shhhhhhhhh... they need new bagholders to pump it to 20k... you're spoiling the fun. We're playing a game of musical chairs.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:31:31
Give me unlimited Tether printing ability and I will ;)
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:47:22
Shhhh.... let the man convince himself that all is fine.
