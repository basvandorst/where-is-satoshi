Yup, rookies buy the knives as they fall, get cut up, and sell again further adding supply and downside pressure.

Can you actually explain what is wrong with *fiat* with an actual convincing argument? What you said is just a statement with no validity.

Although that is a distinct possibility, your comment has absolutely no purpose other than to spite the man, regardless of how stupid his decision was.

It is a fallacious argument to compare these two as they have nothing in common other than the how the data points are connected by - a line. 
The data obtained for the temperature graph is non random while the data obtained for the price chart occurs from human beings whose decision making process is random. This is what I mean by random. 
The temperature data is not random because if one were able to hypothetically build a powerful enough computer and inputted the exact position and direction of every particle on earth, along with their physical laws of interaction, one would then be able to output the results of these interactions.
You would then have a close to 100% prediction capability of where each particle would be in the next period and thus could also accurately predict the resulting weather phenomena. 
Put more simply, if you take two toy cars and collide them together but each time keeping the distance, velocity, and angle of collision the same, then you will find that the cars will end up in the same place at the end each time you repeat the trial (assuming all else equal). Even simpler, drop a ball from the same height and measure time traveled to hit the ground. Identical every trial.
However, you would be hard pressed to use that same computer to generate anywhere near the same accuracy when feeding it data regarding human investment decision making and behaviour. The is because when you introduce humans into the picture, the human ability to take decisions differentiate them from the particle that cannot make decisions. This is the source of the randomness in the data set, the fact that humans can choose to make a financial decision (buy or sell) whereas the particle cannot choose to alter its trajectory. One can be measured at t=0 and used to predict with good accuracy what t=t+1 will be whereas the other (human decisions) cannot be measured at t=0 until t=1 occurs and thus cannot be used to predict what t=1 will be (where t denotes time period).
Compound the fact that human investment behaviour is driven by emotions which further adds to the randomness. I don't understand the circle jerking, pat on the back behaviour you're all demonstrating right now. It's not even funny because it's wrong.

Actually, my stance is that fiat has no real fundamental issues or at least surely not the extent and severity people tend to portray these *issues* as.
What I'm trying to understand is why supporters of BTC (at least on this subreddit) are so anti fiat and thus far I have not come across a valid, factual argument that stems from reason. My explanation is that either: 
**(1)** The most vocal BTC supporters tend to also be the most economic illiterate and thus selection bias explains the above
**(2)** There's an actual good reason but I just haven't read it yet

Or $0? May as well point out every possibility.
