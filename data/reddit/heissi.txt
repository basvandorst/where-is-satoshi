As far as I know astronauts at the ISS don't have "real" internet. They have a crappy (because of coverage) remote-desktop connection to a PC at NASA, which is separated from all other equipment because of security reasons and that PCs have internet access. 
This would mean the private key still is on earth (unless copied and stored locally of course).
I don't know if this is true anymore, my source for this is coverage from a shuttle-mission two years ago (STS-134 or 133 I think).

blockchain.info should be relatively secure, because the private keys corresponding to your bitcoins in a wallet are encrypted locally by a chosen password.
So neither the password nor the unencrypted keys are transmitted, so obviously they cannot be stored onto their server. This does not mean it's completely secure, but if you have a strong password, you should be okay if the site gets compromised (to transfer your bitcoins to another address).
If you think about it, it is as secure as using bitcoin-qt and uploading your encrypted wallet to dropbox.
But nevertheless: Online-wallets should only be used for smaller amounts.

And you can "mistype" a few characters and the code still works because it has some redundant information stored in it.
I don't really like Armory, because I'm no power-user, but that feature is nice.

If we talk about strength of a password, entropy would be a nice measurement. 
The entropy of "0-9" is 3.3 bit per randomly chosen character, the entropy of the Oxford English Dictionary (according to their website it consists of more than 600000 words) would be 19.2 bit per randomly chosen word.
So your "0-9" password must be at least 5-6 times larger than your  dictionary password  to be of equal strength.
[e]Well, 600000 words is a bit unfair. Let's say there are 5000 common words and we have an entropy of 12.3 bits per word.[/e]
