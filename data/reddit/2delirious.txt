I live in Australia and I wouldn't trust anything on news.com.au. They're basically a tabloid posing as a news site. There are far more reputable news sites here.

I'm guessing it's a whale push before CME futures expiry. Buy up tons of bitcoin pushing market up for a few days. Short  even more bitcoin futures at 3x leverage at the top. Dump bitcoin just before expiry, pushing price down and making a profit on most of it on the way down. Pay off some journalist to spread some FUD and push the price down further. Reap in huge gains on short futures at expiry as well. Could be wrong, but that's a random guess from a stranger on the Internet.

True. Guess we'll all find out soon.

Glad to hear they started at 0. True nerds count from 0

So we have one untrustworthy source quoting another. Although I don't see this article linking to any another.

One  option I read about is to keep cashing out half your profits each time your portfolio hits a new high. Unfortunately it reduces your long term growth in half, but reduces your risk. Half of the growth we've been seeing is still pretty good. You could also make sure you don't start cashing out until you've held for at least a year to reduce tax.

I think there'll be big players in the futures market, so  pro traders in the btc market will watch their movements and be influenced by them. The tail wagging the dog
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:45:36
I don't see how that's possible with so much interest because of CME and CBOE bitcoin futures listings this month

This gives some ideas:  Old info, on different markets but still applies

In what way is the government stepping in? I hadn't heard that

If you started in January you'd be up 750% instead of 1500%. That's a big sacrifice but your maximum drawdown is also 50% long term. It depends on how risk averse you are. This strategy would feel a lot better for some if it ever drops 80% as it did in 2013. You'd be down 40% instead of 80%.

I think CME trades more futures than CBOE, so their futures should have more impact

Its a major hassle, but one option is to trade on multiple exchanges to minimise risk. Depends on how actively you trade though, might be impossible if its multiple times a day.

Sounds like it's only for institutional investors. What a pity.

Cool, thanks for the response

Australian crypto tax is terrible. You can still lose the capital gains tax discount even after holding for a year if they "feel" that you were investing as a speculator instead of a long term investor, entirely at their discretion. One of the most backward tax systems for investors, feelings should have no place in law.

For those too lazy to watch 22 mins :) what price level is support at?
