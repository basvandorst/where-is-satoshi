No problem man. I understand completely. Thanks for the tip!

There are. Elliptic Vault is a good example, as it is backed by Lloyds of London. About as respectable as you can get. Using their system, you deposit your bitcoin to their wallet, declare a value in GBP that you feel it is worth, I believe not to exceed the current market value of the bitcoin deposited, and they charge you a fee of 2% of the declared value annually, taken from your wallet in bitcoin.
It is a first step, but is nowhere near the 0% I pay for coverage up to $250k with a simple bank account.

Never said that. In fact, if you follow the thread further, you will see that I specifically say that if it becomes a national level issue, we have bigger problems than getting what will equate to worthless paper at that point. However, it is a very real protection against the collapse of a single depository bank.

The lack of an equivalent of FDIC for bitcoin is the reason.

That's true. Doesn't change the one that I would pick given the option, for obvious reasons. A certain cost now is more expensive than a potential cost later is an attitude that will never be defeated, no matter how high the potential future cost is.

While you are technically correct, I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for it. The profit/loss ratio is skewed way too far towards loss. Considering that I don't pay any fees for my bank accounts which carry the insurance, said company would somehow have to charge whomever this bitcoin bank business is without the cost being passed on to me, the consumer, and have that be so profitable that if the bitcoin bank went the way of Mt Gox, the company could cover all the bitcoin that was stored there without going under itself. Technically not impossible, but practically it is.

No argument from me. I'm fully in favor of putting Glass-Steagull back on the books. Not likely to happen though.

Tipping what resonates most with me. Well said good sir/maddam.

That's why it is federal. The "Full Faith and Credit of the United States Government" stands behind it. In such a case that a situation were to arise where the government couldn't cover the bill, we have much larger problems than whether or not people are able to exchange their account credits into paper fiat currency. Basically, if it ever gets that bad, the country just collapsed anyway, so it no longer matters.

I support Shriners Hospitals for Children, but unfortunately they aren't currently setup to accept bitcoin donations.

Well shit. Does that mean I have to give back the $700 profit I have made from a $300 investment in mining and altcoins? 
This Coke good, Pepsi bad method of measuring the uses and potential methods of exploiting circumstances for the purpose of financial gain is sophomoric at best.

Anyone who tells you they are doing anything with cryptocurrencies for any reason other than making money is either lying to you or trying to sell you something.
I never said anything about selling mining machines at all. I mined a huge variety of coins myself. Never bitcoin, because that is utterly futile unless you are willing to make a huge upfront investment at this point, but a ton of different altcoins. As a for instance of exploiting a circumstance, I made quite a bit by mining blackcoin during the 10000 block mining period before it went pure PoS and immediately exchanging all coins mined to dogecoin and bitcoin.
I have personally never resold a miner, but I know that people do, so I'll go down the path you did even though it doesn't apply to me. Your argument seems to be that we need to make it such that the willfully ignorant are not able to be taken advantage of by people trying to take advantage of them. Aside from being impossible in practice, it is ridiculous in concept. If someone is making a decision to invest in anything without significant research, they are the proverbial fool that will be quickly separated from their money, and I have no sympathy whatsoever for them. Same applies to people buying stocks without looking at a prospectus first. It is nobody's fault but their own that they were willfully ignorant.
Finally, I may have structured the sentence poorly, but my statement was intended to be that the coke vs pepsi mentality is sophomoric at best. This is exactly what you are saying. All altcoins are bad, bitcoin is good, and everyone should guide newbs away from all altcoins for their best interest seems to be your basic argument. Explain how that doesn't boil down to coke good, pepsi bad.
