depending on what your definition of deep understanding is. Jimmy isn't greg maxwell but he can explain to you what Schnorr's sig or MAST is suppose to be.

Jimmy Song is a bitcoin core dev and is pretty knowledgable when it comes to Bitcoin tech. Although he rarely talks about the deep technicals stuff when they do a show together.

You can use the official Bitcoin wallet to import your paper wallet

I agree that giving btc to Coinbase is same as an IOU. However, tools like coinbase are onramps for less technical people. They get some exposure to Bitcoin and once they are more comfortable they can move their coins to paper/hardware or their own nodes.

I really like the Hub, I think all big LN nodes should have something like that
