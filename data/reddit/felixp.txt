Of course, I was just pointing out that if one had $3m USD worth of BTC, the smart thing to do would be to liquidate slowly (i.e. a rate at which most people probably wouldn't notice)

This would actually be a great bitcoin business to start.

They can't stop BitCoin completely, but they can do a few things to make life hard:
a) Assuming that BitCoin does not become a serious reserve currency (which I think is, sadly, unlikely), then there will still need to be exchanges where one can exchange BitCoins for dollars, gold, EUR, etc- and these exchanges are inherently centralized bottlenecks and thus vulnerable.  You might be running a BitCoin business and making the equivalent of $5m USD/year in BitCoins, but you'll still need to pay your mortgage in dollars/euros/etc.
b) They can't completely shut the system down, but they can make transactional pain/risks pretty high.  If you think the RIAA and MPAA make file sharing a PITA, imagine what the DEA, IRS, and Goldman Sachs will do.

Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?

But you're not stuffing your USD-denominated savings under the mattress (I hope), which is basically what this guy is doing.
He's treating the BitCoins as an investment in and of themselves, rather than as a vehicle/denomination for making actual investments (stocks, bonds, real estate, whatever).

Well, given the scale of the economy, it's not like he could liquidate everything at once without seriously hurting his returns.
