The picture is 3d-modeled, it's not a photo.

So why hasn't he done it yet?
@_date: 2017-01-26 05:31:15
And possibly made millions by shorting bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-18 22:35:27
The first one is confirmed.
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:03:33
Stop using a 3rd party scam like coinbase. 
It's not your bitcoins if you don't control the keys.
@_date: 2017-01-13 14:44:07
I'd guess $300-$1500.

What if some malicious miner includes 1 terabyte worth of transactions in the block?
@_date: 2017-01-14 22:54:15
I was confused too. Really bad idea to split a service between different domains.
@_date: 2017-01-12 13:12:15
I wonder why all trading pros have such bad mics.
@_date: 2017-01-14 12:08:13
I'm still crying I missed the bitcoin train.
@_date: 2017-01-15 00:00:06


You forget about other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:10:49
I have some ideas, but because I was born in a poor family in a 3rd world country it will be very difficult to realise them. Another unfair thing.
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:30:10
I was talking about early miners.
There was recently a thread in which some guy said he found his old hard drive with 72 bitcoins. That's $60,000 out of thin air.

Not necessary. Companies with big pockets lure bad developers with big mouth and small brain, basically scammers, who can easily pass the interview. That security system they had could've only be made by a very stupid person. I hope they learned the lesson to not hire garbage.

We should ask first, if Satoshi suddenly appeared and sold all of his 700 million dollar worth of bitcoins, would he pay any taxes? If no, nobody should care how the company earned its bitcoins. 
The bitcoins are exchanged to the local currency with which the product to sell is bought. And then the product is bartered for bitcoins as described in the scheme.
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:36:40
They can make bitcoin illegal in your country. So if you got caught using it, you would be prosecuted.
@_date: 2017-01-27 13:44:15


It could be one person, probably an IT student, without criminal background besides hacking.
@_date: 2017-01-12 16:28:58
"... for now".
@_date: 2017-01-27 10:39:33
It would be difficult for the hacker to cash out $100m worth of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-01-17 05:44:16
To sell?
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:14:03
It would be the time to buy.
@_date: 2017-01-14 17:36:46
But we don't pay taxes each time we exchange BTC to USD and USD to BTC.
@_date: 2017-01-18 17:21:00
Bitcoin = $872 = 872 * 0 = 0?
@_date: 2017-01-08 12:17:17
The fees per block are already around 1BTC, which is good even without the block reward.
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:38:29
Bitcoin is just a tool for making a couple of people rich.
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:26:11
Gold never gained a million times in price, so yes, it's fair.
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:34:25
How many of the traders know about reddit?
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:56:43
Well, the existence of other not fair things doesn't make bitcoin fair.
@_date: 2017-01-15 22:03:47
You answered your own question by using Google as an example. It is one of the most successful companies and it only gained 100x in price. And unlike bitcoin it has real value for people.
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:58:47
Wake me up when it hits at least $1500.
