What about Breyer Capital investing in VeChain? Stay small minded and you'll continue to miss out on a lot of money

I like Blockchain wallet, app on my phone and can also access it from my computer on blockchain.info

Yes there would be a miner fee to send it from your Trezor, no you can send them right to Coinbase just look for your BTC wallet address under "Accounts"!

I think you'd be perfectly fine leaving it there for a week, yes. But always good practice to keep under your control whenever possible. Make sure you sell it through GDAX if you plan to sell, you'll get a better rate.

Actually next ATH would be $21,000

This. I'm sick of seeing the same % gain reference. What will people say when Bitcoin goes back to. 1k? Oh well it is up 1000% from 2013!

RequestNetwork would be a good application here

Well it's priced in FIAT not BTC so it changes with the price of BTC automatically

Unfortunately a lot of banks are making it very difficult to buy cryptocurrency at the moment, and Coinbase doesn't help either. Gemini is good but they are so backed up with new users that it took a month for them to verify my account. Bitcoin ATMs are okay but sometimes the fees are pretty expensive which means you'd have to make decent returns just to break even. How much are you looking to buy? Are we talking like $100 or $1000+?

Not bad luck if he didn't sell when he made those first few buys! ;)

Where is your backup seed...?

So the people who see the value in crypto and speculate and buy early should not turn a profit is what they're saying?

I would invest in a hardware wallet if you're gonna buy that much.
