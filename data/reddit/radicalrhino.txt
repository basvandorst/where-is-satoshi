It sure did make headlines in Israel. Several people mentioned it to me, 'did you hear they found the inventor of Bitcoin?', including my girlfriend who doesn't usually read the tech or financial sections

The video (which obviously is in Hebrew) is on an ELI5 level and is very balanced.
Translation of the video's description:
Bitcoin is not just a mathematical puzzle whose solution using expensive computers can make us rich, not only a cryptocurrency used by drug dealers and weapons traders: It represents freedom from the influence of governments and central banks, and from the costs of intermediaries. Is its value determined according to whims, or does it have real economic value?

I just transferred to namesilo.com from eNom. I think they are pretty good and cheap. You can get a bulk discount if you fund your account there first. Also, they have free whois privacy. Although for some odd reason you have to wait for 6 confirmations when paying with bitcoin, which I think is silly because they could have just cancelled the registration if anything went wrong.
