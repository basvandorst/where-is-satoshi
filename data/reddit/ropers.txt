I'm under the impression –or that is to say I have a hunch– that there are many economists out there who would simply dismiss this speech as evidence of an insufficient understanding of how our current economic system works. However, I am not really able to be an apologist for either side, because I have an insufficient understanding of how these things work.
Is there a place –maybe here– where  these things could be factually discussed, and are there people –maybe you– who would take it upon themselves to render [apologias]( for either of these two positions?

Can somebody explain to me how these work? I do not understand physical bitcoins.

For some value of "instantaneous". From the point of view of a photon, maybe. Unless they have a superluminal speed transaction system, in which case, causality is hard; let's go shopping!

But how can you trust that whoever made these put a valid private key inside before putting the sticker on? I mean, there's a reason why the production of physical currency is heavily police and not just outsourced and decentralised to just about everybody. But this goes against the very nature of what bitcoin is.

Do ebay's TOS allow sellers to list items with *only* bitcoins accepted?

I know enough after reading your comment to understand that you're ill informed. However, I don't know enough to write a clear explanation why that is.

I've thought about this before, and since I first thought about this, I actually have found a bitcoin porn site. (I don'r remember the address right now and wouldn't want to advertise it here if I did.) The trouble with the site that I found was that it was altogether too much commitment: 
I think paying models some bitcoins on the honour system, similar to giving someone reddit gold, that would be great and it might work. But the site I saw required paying in advance for camgirl/guy accounts. That would be altogether too much commitment for me. When I'm in the mood for porn, I'm not looking for a relationship. Thanking individual models after the fact because you appreciate their work is very different from the effort, premeditation, commitment and also somewhat pig-in-a-poke business of buying access to cam streams.

Am I reading this incorrectly, or are they claiming there that *"The USA is overtaken by China in the field of scientific research."* was a dystopian statement?
In a world where all men are created equal, it is entirely reasonable and just to expect that billions of people should be able to enjoy more scientific opportunities and produce more good science than hundreds of millions of people. 
If you believe that it was the birthright of a minority of the human population to retard the development and scientific enlightenment of a majority of the human population, just so the minority can feel that relatively speaking, they're top dog and number one, then you don't believe in all men being created equal, you don't believe in a rising tide lifting all boats, you're willing to retard overall progress just so you can be ahead relatively speaking, and there are rather excellent chances that you're an asshole.

If ordinary decent folk chicken out of using a free currency on grounds that criminals might also use it, then only criminals will be using it.
Early in the game, you have a chance to shape the landscape and set precedents. Can you imagine Linux distros refusing to make ISO torrents available because The Pirate Bay exists?

I am friends with a white Bitcoiner. It has taken over our lives, but I love it!
However, there is a serious lack of Whites around here, and I want to change that. I love to spend me some Bitcoin and want to connect with other Whiteys who do too. Send the Whites in your lives my way!! 
PS: ٤&gt; Plz help me advertise my website on reddit because I am *A GIRL*, tee-hee! xxx &lt;3

Funnily enough, the people who make claims like the parent poster's also frequently are the very same people who seek to restrict others (which they don't control with unfair contracts) from generating information. This is easy under the current regime (which their lobbying work has created) because no information is generated from nothing and [everything is a derivative work]( but the current regime acts as if that weren't the reality and employs the legal fiction of "intellectual property", which is very handy for crushing up-and-coming creators. These people's behaviour is basically a [rent-seeking]( "pay me, or you shouldn't be *allowed* to generate information worth sharing". This is their wish and they act as if their selfish wish were a natural law and demand that society bear the cost of imposing and enforcing it on everybody.

This may be an old thing, but I gotta say this, to get it out of my system:
About AOL firing the employee at the end: I'm 100% convinced that the employee only did what he did because AOL trained him to do it, and that AOL fired him just to turf off and deflect the blame for something that was 100% their fault.

This is very off-topic now, but can you or anyone explain why only some methods of effectively superluminal motion violate causality? Okay, so warp bubbles don't. Would a wormhole? Would some other way? Why or why not?

The deal-breaker with DuckDuckGo –why I still don't use it; worse, why I find it unusable– is that it does not tell you the number of search results returned. It gives you no idea how relatively popular things are. So if I search for zyx and xyz, DDG is simply not going to tell me which of the two is more popular. Not even in ballpark terms. I'm sure it's great what with the bitcoin-friendliness and all, but as an everyday search engine? Fuhgeddaboudit.
PS: There's also no easy way (that I can see) to jump to the nth results page, which makes it close to impossible to use DDG to find out what the less popular search results for a given query are. And the way DDG just appends the "second page" and successive "pages" of search results to the same webpage is a usability catastrophe, because it makes things progressively harder to navigate (and can crash some browsers) the farther you get – and for what? Flashy AJAXy "because we can" boastfulness? Because guess what, the DHTML insertion of the additional results "page" also triggers a loading process, so why not KISS and reload the page like a sane developer would?

Does this mean that physical bitcoins are single-use only? 
(Because without peeling off the back, a recipient won't know that he's actually received bitcoins, and after it's been peeled off, the physical token is worthless because everybody can see the key. Seems a heck of a lot of effort just to tell the recipient the key. Or what am I missing?)

If people only accept physical bitcoins with undamaged stickers, then that means that either, yes, these are single-use only, or, if people were to re-circulate physical bitcoins while leaving the sticker intact, then that would make it very easy for a dodgy issuer (which might be the original issuer or a third-party counterfeiter, and you'd never know which because physical bitcoins aren't well traceable), again, it would make it very easy for a bogus bitcoin issuer to create physical coins without a valid key under the sticker – and as long as people don't peel it off, they'd be none the wiser. [Also see here.](
PS: And as for verifying the block balance, well, I, your sneaky bogus issuer, could still use genuine keys, *spend the bitcoins*, and still print them under my bogus bitcoin stickers, couldn't I?
