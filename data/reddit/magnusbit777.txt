He's been making a lot less predictions on anything with numbers because I think he knows they are usually off as well and are completely objective unlike most of his other predictions that are subjective. He did say in his twitter recently that he saw silver above $26 in Dec but he also noted that it could very well not happen. 42 mins ago on twitter he tells  that the webbot cannot predict moves down in Bitcoin it only shows size, emotion and moves up. I dunno, he says Bitcoin is going up and when it drops he says he can't see those things, I mean why say it's going up than?

I've been keeping semi keeping track of his predictions for precious metals and mostly Bitcoin ever since my post about Clif. THe list below are predictions made by him from either twitter, videos or his Altas reports. As you can see most of them are wrong and I kinda stopped keeping track after Sept. His more recent predictions on Bitcoin was that it would not stay in the $700's long. 
I asked him about his major prediction for July "the 12 days" where shit would hit the fan and nothing happened. He said "the powers that be" create false flags and change the energy or direction of where humanity is going thus also changing his predictions. My critique is that his IM and ST data were wrong in that "12 days" prediction and if those can be off then how reliable is the webbot really... His predictions pre summer for Bitcoin seemed accurate but I didn't really keep track before that. 
So the question now is are his explanation of how something pans out maybe semi accurate? Because I think it's plausible to say that his timing is usually off.
-clif says when bitcoin hits $650 USD silver will take off and Bitcoin will not go below $425 again
-once bitcoin passes $999usd it will go to $2000 in a matter of days than it's going to hang around $2000 for a while. Gold and silver will take off at this consolidation point. Than after consolidation bitcoin will go to $14000 mid 2017. 
-bitcoin will consolidate at $2000 until dec/2016 during this consolidation silver/gold will make a move up. 
-bitcoin will not go below $680 after july.12 and when it touches $1000 for the first time it will drop to $900 and do this a few times
-after bitcoin passes $2200 its emotional value leaves gold and goes off on its own thing
-silver rises faster than bitcoin for the next two years 2016-2018 and then bitcoin rises faster after
-Ack! LT data still shows silver wanting to be 1 to 1 with gold (2018?)!
-Ack! IM data confirms Jan 2016 ALTA! BTC to leave 650s in last week in July! Rising through Aug 18 as 'markets melt (like ice in summer)'!
-Ack! ST data shows 'air gaps' 4 Ag begins Aug 10! First 'jump up' in Ag 2be TM 4 'bank runs' in Europe! Street battles ongoing then in EU!
-Ack! Future headlines: Bonds BBQ'd by Oct 15! PopWar in Europe goes mobile in November! Rains destroy trains (EU?)! Cable car crashes!
-bitcoin up 9% per day in mid Nov
-bitcoin going over $1000 by the end of Oct
-80808 yuan bitcoin when silver is $700 and gold is $25000 Oct.19 video

Im new to Bitcoin but can't one just buy a laptop create an offline electrum wallet on that laptop and just makes sure it never connects to any networks?

lol unfortunately my Clif High post was more popular than this one. Humanity is in for a shock.
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:04:43
because money

Bo Polny thinks there will be a bond collapse in Oct or something like that. Guess we'll find out soon enough

Ack is to differentiate his post regarding the webbot from his regular tweet post.
@_date: 2016-07-08 13:00:00
Actually that is his limited understanding of what he thinks is happening. Even tho he created the program he really doesn't know for sure, exactly where the information comes from. He may be right or half right, maybe there are other factors in play. What we do know tho, is that some predictions are very specific and anything over 50% (regarding bitcoin) predicting the future is amazing.

never trust anything more than an astrologer, my priest said so
@_date: 2016-07-08 13:02:35
maybe we are looking at this too specifically. Perhaps if we look at the overall picture of the global economy, and it does implode, than Bitcoin could very well go to the moon and bring everyone along with it. Fundamentally the global economic system is in trouble.

A lot of the doomsday stuff was suppose to happen but was neutralized. The media will come out with truth reports in the future that will clear all misunderstandings
@_date: 2016-07-09 19:01:20
I dont care all too much about anything else he says it can be subjective. But with Bitcoin he gets very specific with numbers which come correct. If there is anything truth in something that can get me paid, there must be an intelligent investigation rather than scoff assumptions.

So I bought a laptop that I never plan on using online to make a Electrum wallet. I will be transferring coins to the online watch only wallet. Are you saying that when I withdraw from my watch only wallet(signed with offline) I need to make a new wallet with a new seed all over again because my offline private key is now broadcasted and traceable?
