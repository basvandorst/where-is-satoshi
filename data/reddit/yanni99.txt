I tried to find the article in English but all local Anglos media were just saying ATM so Reddit would not have believed it.
Google Translate for the lazy :
At least one perpetrator broke into a grocery store in the borough of Ahuntsic-Cartierville in Montreal late Sunday night to steal an automated teller machine.
Around 10:30 pm, the thief (s) broke the glass door of Euromarché Latina 80, located at the corner of Laurentien Boulevard and rue de Louisbourg.
Then, they entered the commercial hall, where they seized an automated teller machine that they loaded into a vehicle before fleeing, "said Daniel Lacoursière, spokesperson for the Police Department. City of Montreal (SPVM).
The owner of the grocery store told TVA Nouvelles that the stolen counter was used to distribute Bitcoins, a virtual currency. At its current rate, a Bitcoin is worth about $ 1260 CDN.
The value of the flight was valued at $ 200 or $ 300. However, damage to the front door is closer to $ 10,000.
The trade was closed at the time of the crime and no employee was on site, the SPVM said. However, many witnesses would have witnessed the flight, as Boulevard Laurentien was quite busy.
The SPVM opened an investigation to try to trace the burglars. No description of the suspects or their vehicle was disclosed
P.s. I am also lazy for not correcting anything in that text.
