You're right that at any moment, total sellers equals total buyers. When people say "a lot of people are selling", what they really mean is "a lot of people are so eager to sell that they are willing to sell for a lower price than before".

You might be fine with it personally, but the overwhelming majority of things that get upvoted here are pro-bitcoin. It's almost impossible to get traction here with a post about any serious flaws in bitcoin or the associated ecosystem (e.g. USDT)

2FA might help avoid your own personal account being hacked, but it does nothing to prevent your exchange's bitcoin hot wallet being hacked, and your exchange becoming insolvent.

He didn’t mean you can only trade 4.0 BTC at once. He means there are only 4 cryptocurrencies on gdax: BTC, BCH, ETH, and LTC.

Legally, paying someone in BTC is considered the same as converting it to USD and then paying them in USD, and then them converting it from USD back to BTC upon receipt.

Who knows? If people knew where the price would be tomorrow then it would already be there now.
Anyone who can tell you confidently that bitcoin will go up in X days is lying. It could take shorter, or longer. It also might never go up at all, and just stay at 13.8k forever. Or it could go to zero. We really don’t know.

Are you sure? The candlestick chart says the lowest it went was 11,000; on the other hand, that has been buggy in the past.

Is there any subreddit or other place online where reasonable, well-argued positions on BOTH sides (pro- and anti-bitcoin) are welcome?
I’d like to read something in between the exuberance of and the conspiracy-minded pessimism of . Does such a place exist? is the closest I’ve found, but a lot of people there are too heavily into technical analysis (which is basically tea leaf reading as far as I’m concerned), not into discussion of the tech long-term.

4 digits on gdax
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:30:17
But the adjustment time is measured in blocks, not time. If 90% of the hash power were suddenly lost, it would take 20 weeks, not two. So there can be a death spiral if the slowdown causes the price to crash which in turn causes mining to become unprofitable, causing blocks to get found even slower, ad Infinitum.

1000 wallets *certainly* doesn't mean 1000 people.
One of those wallets could belong to Coinbase for example and correspond to thousands/millions of people's BTC accounts on Coinbase/GDAX.

Why would they want to hold BTC as opposed to something like USD or Euros?
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:30:35
In the US the base currency is considered dollars. Any time you trade anything for anything else, for tax purposes it is considered equivalent to converting to the fair value in dollars and then using those.

It is patched but many cloud providers have not forced reboots for affected servers yet. 


Why? Having read the disclosures, it seems pretty easy to read arbitrary memory.


It is pretty simple. Gdax for example publishes which cloud host they use (AWS East). Anybody can go sign up for 1000 EC2 instances and hope one of them gets put on the same host as a Gdax instance.
(I'm just using Gdax as an example here; the same could apply to others.)


It takes around an hour to "get fully to Fiat". Getting my fiat off of Gdax and into a real bank will take a bit longer, but that step is probably not strictly necessary since fiat deposits on Gdax are insured, and in any case, it's much easier to reverse fraudulent fiat transactions than fraudulent blockchain transactions, by design.


There is no need for insults. I'm just trying to warn people so they can make their own reasoned decisions.

Send 0.03 to an exchange like gdax, sell it, then transfer your money to your bank account.
Sorry about the transaction fees. No way around it.

Do you control your own bitcoin or are they on some exchange like coinbase, gdax, bitfinex, etc?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:51:23
Fees on Gdax are only 0.25% per market orders. You’d be way ahead of you had correctly timed the market and made the trades. (Not that I’m saying this was a good idea, as you probably wouldn’t have timed the market correctly. But trading fees aren’t really a good reason to hold)

Exponential growth means the same thing as compound growth.
The economy steadily growing 3% a year (or 1% a year, or 0.001% a year, or x% a year where x is any positive number) is exponential growth by definition.

This meme needs to die. The dollar can still purchase roughly the same basket of real-world goods and services that it could a month ago.
Maybe in the future things will change (and that's a lot of what you're betting on when you buy bitcoin), but for now, in 2017, the dollar is a much more stable unit of value than bitcoin is.

I'm a software engineer (working for Amazon, incidentally, but I have no more knowledge than you do about whether we're planning on accepting bitcoin soon).
It's outrageously difficult to predict in advance how long a software project will take. Being wrong by several hundred percent is quite common. Usually we underestimate, but sometimes the opposite happens. Maybe they just finished this a lot earlier than they thought they would.

Each confirmation takes, on average, 10 minutes (but this is random so it can be much longer or much shorter). Different people have different policies for how many confirmations they require before they consider a transaction to be completed. I've seen it range from 1 to 6. So depending on the merchant's policies, it would take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour on average. Again, these are just averages and it can vary wildly.
