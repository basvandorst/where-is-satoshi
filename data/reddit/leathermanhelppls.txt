Coinbase just deleted that huge Bitcoin Cash spike up to $8k from their charts...charts show as if it never happened.

A lot of my coworkers bought Litecoin at the ATH and are now all pissed that it's losing money. I encourage them to hodl because that's what I did! I'm enjoying my 2x growth of my initial Bitcoin purchase! Glad I went for bitcoin because I have doubled the value of my purchase so far, and I think that hodling is a good strategy for them to use to help their Litecoin funds grow over time instead of panic selling
Going to make sure I keep smart about it though, not going to dump in a wad of cash from my paycheck and lose what I can't afford to. Slow but steady payments.

Hey guys, Bitcoin is on sale for a special price of $15k! Buy in now before it’s too late!!
Edit: what the fuck? It went up to 16.4k in the time it took me to type that post. Too late!!

I'll offer you some bitcomb for your bitcone, or some bitcoil for your bitcorn if you don't want to get rid of your bitcone.

This past 90 seconds has gone fucking nuts. What the hell
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:16:54
Why is there so much action right now? Can anyone explain it to me in simple-ish terms?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:58:12
I thought it was Hold On for Dear Life!

I bought in at $8k with a $1k investment. I've doubled my money in like 2 weeks!! This is nuts. The spikes and bubble talk do somewhat worry me, but I want to hodl for a while. 
I'm almost thinking I should take out $1000 and that way I have 0 chance of ever losing any money since I get my principal back, and it would eliminate my desire to take any money out in the future because it's essentially just winnings, not actually my money.
I would never even really need to check the prices because I'd have no worries of whatever would happen; if it went to 0 one day I would not care and would not get hurt, if it went to $100k I would be gaining value. The peace of mind would be great.
To me, it's better than a GDAX auto-sell at $8000 because I would get the $1000 back but have no bitcoin at all left if I did that. If I sold the $1000 now I'd still have 5% of bitcoin left until it dropped to $0. But, the longer I hold on, the less bitcoin I'd have to sell off to get my $1000 back (assuming it keeps going up).

The alts have gone fucking nuts this week. What gives? Bitcoin is going up but the altcoins are exploding upwards.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:33:26
Just go to Accounts and click on Bitcoin, then click sell. You'll enter how much you want to sell and get hit with a little fee, but the money will go right into your bank account once it goes through.

About to hit lunch break, prepare for an influx of buyers who are on their phones during break!!
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:44:53
Exactly. Gotta be in it for the long haul to see strong gains in value not just pump &amp; dump quick transactions
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:05:18
I always kick myself for not investing when I thought I should, but I know for a fact that if I'd bought in at $1k I would have sold out at $2k and thought I'd made out like a king with 100% returns. 
I recently bought in when it was at about $8k value and I'm hodling on for the ride!

Reminds me of how A&amp;W Burger had a marketing campaign flop, where they [promoted the 1/3lb burger and Americans thought 1/3rd sounded smaller than 1/4th pound]( (the 4 sounded bigger) so their sales for the burger totally failed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:49
You’ve already made like 12% returns in 3 minutes lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:03
My thoughts exactly! Haha. Little bounce down to 14k then spring back up
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:30:43
What does a January '18 contract mean? Why is it at 16.5k?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:02:18
So with the announcement that futures will come out on Sunday and next week....would you expect a rocket (or drop) in the price as a result or will it not have much of an effect?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:20:57
What does the futures market mean?
I know it kind of opens it up to Wall Street, but I don't know exactly what that means for us hodlers
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:03
I invested at $8k and by today you and I have officially doubled our money! Can't wait to see what the future has in store

Holy fucking shit how did bitcoin cash jump so high that fast???
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:00:59
Woohoo just hit my DOUBLE on returns. Bought in at $8250 so my money has officially doubled. I know a lot of folks here have gotten 500%+ returns but I am excited that my money has gotten a 100% return so far.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:21:13
How fucking great is it that a "dip" is to $16,000?? 
Can you imagine how nuts that would have sounded if I told you that just 1 week ago?
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:35:05
For me, I know for a fact that if I'd bought in at $1k or so I would have sold it as fast as I could at $2k, thinking I'd made it out with a steal.
I bought in at $8,250 and I'm not selling till we hit the moon. Always wish I'd done it sooner but I know I am more mature now and won't sell until I actually need the money for something (down payment on house/car, for example).
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:16:43
I just bought in at the same exact price today for my first purchase. I did a small amount (not a full coin) but I am convinced it'll dip to 5k and come back just to spook me ��
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:18:14
So I have about 10% of a bitcoin and plan on moving it over to an external wallet (like a ledger or trazer USB stick thing). I want to send some of my paycheck into bitcoin on a weekly basis, maybe $50-$75. 
Is there a quicker way to do this than making a bank transfer to coinbase and paying the service charge (1.4% ish) every time? Is it even possible to have my paycheck be partially sent to a bitcoin purchase? my direct deposit goes into my bank account btw. Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:40
Holy shit lol this is fun. I just bought in last week and have been waiting for this type of thrill.
 Everyone just lost their shit and broke Coinbase in the panic. It dropped to $9k, now it's already back up to $10k, all within like 15 minutes.
 IS WHAT IVE BEEN MISSING OUT ON!
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:02:12
Yep I'm just gonna hang around and keep it locked up for a while. No need to bring it out any time soon! Going to enjoy the ride
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:29:41
SCREW IT
 OF DAY
I wish! But I agree, it'll come quicker than end of year. Holiday spending will give it a big bump
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:35:11
I can't wait for a huge dip so I can buy even more! My goal is to own a full bitcoin by 2019.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:30:47
Looking to join in on the Bitcoin roller coaster through Coinbase now that I have a stable job, emergency fund, and 401k set up. 
Coinbase is my preferred "wallet" because I trust a reputable 3rd party over my hardware hopefully not conking out, getting lost, getting broken, etc.
Been kicking myself since I watched Bitcoin rise from $3k while pondering if I should invest, and decided that now that I have the means to do it I should give it a shot.
Seeking to purchase 25% of a bitcoin and see where it takes me. Also thinking of dumping $100/month from my paychecks into it as I go. I understand that I could lose it all and I am willing to take on the potential risk to get in on the potential reward, since I believe cryptocurrency/blockchain is the future (could even be the present..??)
Any last minute tips before I hit "purchase"? Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:31:56
I bought the ATH last Monday, and now it's up by $700 from that. No need to worry!! You have the right idea, it is only temporary.
The ATH will keep pushing higher over time, don't let the dips spook you.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:22:23
Too late, by the time you get back it'll be past $10k! 
Buy "$20k" in large balloons so you'll be ready for Thursday's party
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:48:24
I bought in at $8250 and it stayed constant till the 9-11k big push. I was worried for a couple days that I bought at the all time high and I'd lose out....now the real fun begins! 
This is the exhilaration whiplash that I was promised. Going to hodl for all it's worth!
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:08:11
If I have already bought some bitcoin is it too late to transfer that info over to a hardware wallet like the USB stick thing in the image?
For reference I have about a tenth of a bitcoin in my wallet online.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:08:05
"When the price is like 200k"
You act like next Thursday is a long ways away!
(I wish! But it will get there eventually)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:26:29
You need to link a bank account to be able to transfer the funds over. It's possible that you can link it, send the money over to buy bitcoin, and then unlink it. I haven't tried it but someone else may be able to confirm/deny if that's possible.
If you have a credit card or debit card you don't need to link an account since it's just coming off of the card.
Same applies for getting your money out of the exchange; it needs somewhere to land when you take it out.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:35:59
I bought in last Monday for $1000 at the all time high ($8250) and now i have made over $100 in gains from it. I was skeptical at buying in at the all time high but if you trust in Bitcoin there is no reason to wait because it just keeps growing.
Nobody knows where it will go, as it goes with any other investment. Bitcoin is more volatile than stocks, so that comes with good and bad (win big, lose big). Only put in what you can afford to lose, but have faith in what you put in!
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:01:41
Exactly. I put down $1k last week (and it's up to $1200 today!) and that's all I can afford to lose. I've been so tempted to put down another 1k because it is so fun to see it keep going up but I'm staying put at my initial investment.
It's thrilling to see it get so much return so quickly but if the $1k goes poof I will be alright. If I put down more I will really be screwing myself and I can't afford to lose that.
Staying hopeful but smart! As much as I believe in bitcoin and think it will go up, I can't get ahead of myself.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:42:15
As long as you submitted your payment you have it secured at the price you bought it at. I bought my slice of a bitcoin at $8,250 and it was at $9,500 today when my transaction got put into my digital wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:50
I don't believe it's age restrictive. You just need a way to get funds into bitcoin (aka bank acct or a credit card/debit card)
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:13:01
It (or another crypto development) will be the default for money. Fiat will be gone with the wind in the far future.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:01:38
Nah I'm keeping it for the long run! May pull it out when I need the cash for a mortgage/car down payment (if they don't take bitcoin at payment!)
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:01:48
What is the difference with Litecoin? I'm thinking of investing a little bit into it to diversify my crypto wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:45:40
Dipped to $8600 on my coinbase acct and I almost sold out of panic that this was the big crash....back up to $9200, the deepest dip is over for now 
Edit: wtf nowhere else says it dipped below 9k...I have a notification from Coinbase's app that it did! Maybe a system glitch with the huge panic that just happened and caused the site to temporarily freeze
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:24:56
I would just like to recognize how amazing it is that so many people lost their shit today with the dip and at the end of the day it is already back at $10,500. 
If you had been told 3 weeks ago that bitcoin would be at $9000 today everyone would lose their minds at how fast it accelerated, yet the fact that it dropped to that level today spooked the hell out of a lot of people who are not willing to hodl. It's all about perspective!
I'm not one to criticize because I just bought in a week ago, and I'm just here for the ride! My purchase is strapped in for the long run. Fuck the moon, I'm waiting till mars to cash out.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:27:14
So can I log into Coinbase.com and transfer them to a hardware wallet from there, and then they are just on the hardware wallet?
(Sorry for all the dumb questions, I'm a total noob!)
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:02:15
Bitcoin is above my price ability at the moment, so I'm going to be adding in $200 or so per month for a while to add to my 10% share so far. Slowly but surely! Hoping to gain more and more of a share as quickly as I can without sucking up my emergency fund.
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:56:26
Exactly. Much more friendly and informative than "Fuck off read the sidebar"!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:32
It's out because there was a huge panic sell during the dip. The newcomers who bought after $10k because it's all over mainstream media coverage just got spooked by a huge dip and all panic sold. 
Good news is that this probably weeded out some of the "normies" who are only buying and selling based on headlines that uneducated news anchors are spitting out because of the $10k hype 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:59:27
I bought in at 8,250 and it's been below that most of the time since. Frustrating, but I am not panic-selling because I trust in the future of Bitcoin! 
Panic sells are for the weak and hodling is the way to go!
