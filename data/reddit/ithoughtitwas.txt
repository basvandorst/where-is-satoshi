Wow. This is great. I using use a calculator or my brain.

Oh, I thought the gossip papers said Adam Curry had to pay alimony in BTC.

I prefer purse.io for Amazon.

You are the only one that controls the keys and backups easy with an encrypted file or word seed, but you may be at rest to the code to decrypt your back not being accessible when the time comes.
The multisig nature of Copay makes it great to monitor your savings account, but require another key be signed to spend savings.
I have not been using it for savings, but for a shopping wallet, which has keys on multiple devices (ie. 1 of 3).
I have not checked but it had also saved the code to decrypt Copay get generated wallets, I would feel complete safe saving with a multisig of theirs. 
Currently I save with a wallet.dat that is not online, but being watched through blockchain.info wallet.

Bitmaintech. Nice.

It was a joke guys.
Although I do own a substantial amount of DogecoinDark.

Why would you knowingly do business in NY?

Started watching it this weekend. Got interrupted. Thanks for reminding me to go back to it.

Does having 1 key of a 2 of 3 constitute custodial control? Or 1 of a 3 of 5? Where is the line?

Every day is a good day to buy it, if you are going to us it.
If you are trying to time your investment, this probably not the right day.

That is one fine double bottom.

Thanks for the list of companies not to use.

Multisig is where its at. Why anyone would use singles, with multiple backs makes no sense to me. 
Best multiplatform multisig wallet is Copay. You are to an extent relying in their servers being up to broadcast, but you alone hold they keys and the ability to import into another client.

Yes. 
Most like it was mined into an orphan not stuck in mempool because of low priority.
Mining pools do not use the same  rules, do not just take the highest fees.

You can protect your value with a short on coinarch.com.
@_date: 2015-10-24 00:18:38
No, it does depend on who wins the block and what their rules are for including transactions. 
I paid 45 bits.
@_date: 2015-10-23 20:05:10
Yeah, this is going to make me switch to dogecoin dark.
@_date: 2015-11-06 04:58:32
Well, so who bought the bulk of them?
@_date: 2015-10-26 16:52:43
You are right to sell, but unfortunately Coinbase is also right to not let you, when it is not in their interest. 
On some previous run ups, they did the same, by not issuing buys or even freezing and reversing orders. I know they have cost me money, but the bottom line is it is their ramp, not ours.
@_date: 2015-10-23 14:43:55
Is not that a form of anti-credit? 
@_date: 2015-10-23 21:31:12
One of the most annoying things about the current blockchain, is the inconsistent nature of random, unpreventable, unincluded  transactions into blocks.
I do not know the reason, save an inclusion into an orphan block, which later must be rebroadcaster and locked up in another block.
I currently have two fairly large transactions that have been unconfirmed for 3+ hours now.
@_date: 2015-10-26 16:57:36
Miners should be agnostic to these ends.  That being said, I support a diverse mining industry and welcome miners who place abnormal rules on their accepted transactions. Such as miners who reverse priority based on fee.
