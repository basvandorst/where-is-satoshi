he is always considered 'open minded' in China, but if you think what he said could represent the chinese government's opinion on crypto, then you have no idea about chinese politics

mt gox definitely benefited from this market dumping, just think about all the people knowing about this dump before hands, huge money from going short, could be the reason why dump on the market price instead of OTC

no doubt he is awesome but NOT the kind of person to be trusted ever

note that he is not doing it BEFOREHAND, he told u the truth after all the shitcoins are down and useless, and he has already made enough money out of that, exchanged all the shitcoins for btc or usd, seriously, i think everyone should be cautious to THIS KIND of people even if u chose to follow him, be prepared to leave before getting fuxked up so hard
