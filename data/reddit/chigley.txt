Have you forwarded port 8333 from your router to the computer running Bitcoin Core? You need to do this for the node to be reachable from outside.

I'd like to chuck  into the mix as another offsite backup option - an incredible service run by a great guy. Amazon Glacier is also quite a good fit for a wallet backup, it's cheap to store but slightly more expensive to access.

I remember reading a lengthy and well thought-out comment on this sub a couple of months ago by a guy who works at an ISP, writing about how easy it would be for an employee to pull an attack like this off. I'll try my best to find it now.

I feel slightly stupid right now. My .bitcoin/ directory has been ~100GB for quite a while now, and I always assumed it was just the blockchain. Seeing you say 17GB here confused me. Upon further investigation, debug.log was over 80GB! So, a message to others who run bitcoind 24/7: don't forget to logrotate!

I can't promise I'll leave it up forever, but I've cloned your repo on a spare server and hosted it publicly at  No HTTPS I'm afraid - I don't have a wildcard certificate :(
Whilst I agree with the other comments about sending a pull request, I thought this might be helpful for users who either can't or don't want to run it themselves, but might be interested in seeing your changes.
Good work! I'm looking forward to seeing what else you do with it :)

After running my old cracker on it, I can confirm this is legit. No money in the wallet's addresses, but it's a fun exercise :) (Uncompressed address starts with 1F73M, by the way)

As a fairly new Tor node operator I think this is a great idea! Commenting primarily so that I remember to add this to my ContactInfo line when I get home (on holiday on a device I don't normally use at the moment so can't just save the thread).

I tried to make a trade before and it stayed 'Pending' for ages even though I could see an ask that my bid matched, and no other bids that matched it.
The price has moved since then though so things must be moving. Lag, perhaps?

There's a [Java example]( linked to from the [BTC-E API documentation]( page. Have you seen it?

The private key for the address is derived from the brainwallet passphrase. This is all that's needed to take any coins belonging to the address! Sure, the original owner of the wallet OP found might have their wallet encrypted by their client, locked with a different password, but all that password really protects is the private key. OP already has the private key (derived from the brainwallet passphrase) so can spend any coins without needing to know who the original wallet owner is, or needing to attack them in any way at all. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:49:44
AJAX requests to untrusted domains are blocked by default. In this case, the request was to coinb.in which I hadn't approved until now.
I was hoping there'd be a script on coinb.in that you could include in a &lt;script&gt; tag somewhere, so that NoScript would flag the domain up to people like me before your AJAX call, but maybe that's not the case. Ah well, at least you know that my bug was due to paranoid plugin usage rather than your code :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:35:09
Does not already do that?
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:34:57
Exactly. I'm UK here, doing all of my trades in EUR, and getting stung by banks and exchange rates whenever I want to convert! A solid UK exchange would be very much appreciated.

@_date: 2013-12-09 14:48:52


A bug?
Edit: I got as far as Bob creating and signing the transaction, Alice signing it, and it looks like everything broke once it tried to broadcast the transaction. Even after a refresh, the page now seems broken. Both links yield an unknown balance value, with the occasional error about being unable to connect to blockchain.info. Maybe I just got beaten to it :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:41:39
How did the drive 'die'? If you still have it, you could probably get the drive data (incl. private key) professionally restored for a damn sight less than what the BTC on it are worth.
Just don't tell the data restoration company why you want it doing - you don't want them to steal off you!

I use it for GBP-&gt;EUR when depositing to an exchange. Has anyone ever tried withdrawing from an exchange via TransferWise? Does it matter that the account isn't in your name?
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:09:47
Take a look over their account history - there's a submission to and comments mentioning Argentina in the past.
OP - to answer your question, people are reluctant to accept PayPal for BTC since PayPal payments can be reversed, but BTC transactions can't.

Nope; I've never actually done a withdrawal - I'm a believer :) I probably will do at some point in the next few days though so I might look into it!
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:39:16
It was indeed me who managed to take it, so thanks! :)
I worked out what my problem was, too. I use NoScript, and had it set to allow scripts on your domain but not coinb.in. This is because, when I first visited your page, the only domain it requested scripts for was bitrated.com (which I approved). This was the case right up until your call to a Coinbin script, at which point NoScript had been stepping in and blocking it. My advice therefore would be to have your page include a script from coinb.in on all pages, so that NoScript users like me see and approve the coinb.in domain before you try to call some JS hosted by them dynamically.

The app should have an option to export the private key of your wallet. You can use this to back it up.
You could either store the key on a piece of paper (paper wallet) or import it to a software wallet on your computer like Bitcoin-Qt or Electrum.

If you're going to bother having a separate page about security, at least fill it out with some reassuring information about your security policies! Does this mean that two factor authentication isn't supported at the moment? (Other than the email system you mentioned.)
I'd also like to echo question about not being able to view the order book without an account.
Always good to see a new UK exchange, though! Best of luck.

UK here. [TransferWise]( (referral link, hope you don't mind) is really useful for depositing to exchanges that only take deposits in currencies other than GBP. I've been using it to EUR deposit into [Bitcoin-Central]( with no problems at all. I then do all of my trading in EUR.
It's also worth checking sites like [LocalBitcoins]( to see if there's anyone trading for cash in your area. People accept bank transfers on on there too.
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:09:26
Bit of an odd question... but do you think you'll ever open up to other currencies (USD/EUR/GBP) in the future if all goes well? I like you guys - looking at your past Reddit activity you've clearly put a lot of thought into this. It's nice to see an exchange planning everything out and making every best effort to be flawless before launch, rather than rushing to market in the hope of a quick profit :)
Best of luck in the future. I'll have a little hack at the site now before the darts starts in an hour!
@_date: 2013-04-26 10:21:54
Will do :) It's worth checking out if you haven't already. People there at the moment are discussing the best options for UK folk.
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:26:09
Yeah they announced this a few days ago - very annoying. There are hopefully alternative sites available ([CurrencyFair]( looks like one) but I have no idea how good they are. We really need a UK exchange!
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:16:32

OP, will PM you the PIN now. It was indeed 4 digits!
I'll also sort out tipping you some of it in a second.

Why are people downvoting this? The `verify` option on a bitcointip command is optional. In fact, the [documentation]( actually asks that it isn't overused:


Edit: Before anyone says anything about the fuzzy downvoting algorithm or anything like that, I feel the need to point out that this comment was on about -7 points when I saw it earlier. Nice to see things have turned around!

I don't know if anyone's still following this thread, but I had a play with this in Go over the weekend for anyone who's curious:  The speeds seem to compare quite nicely (even to the people who've written theirs in C!) but I haven't managed to get anywhere with finding OP's passphrase. It would appear that it either includes Unicode, or was a play on words with the "protected by only 3 characters".

Reply to reply to edit: it's all behaving fine in Firefox for me now. It was just a bit weird for the first minute or so after my transaction failed to broadcast.

I've been transferring EUR with [TransferWise]( (referral link, hope you don't mind) to [BitCoin Central]( to buy mine. It's been working pretty well - stops me getting shafted by bank fees, and the money only takes a day or so to transfer. I can't comment on BTC-&gt;GBP though, since I'm keeping all of mine in coins :)

Google Drive 404?
Plus, I hope you've not put anything sneaky in there to steal private keys!
