I agree Mario needs to jump in this gif.

It's not that simple. All of these guys claiming money is energy are only seeing half the picture. Some money represents energy /time spent but not all of it. Actual resources have their own inherent value independent of energy spent. You build two identical houses, one with pine and one with redwood. Energy spent is essentially the same but the redwood is going to be more valuable because of the material chosen.

BTW you're missing the fact that objects have inherent value independent of the energy spent to gather it.
You can mine silver or you can mine gold. Energy spent is the same, but the value you gained spending that energy is very different.

A brown dragon obviously.

I mean if you wanna focus on one detail to try and derail the argument cool. But it being redwood or whatever else is pretty irrelevant. The point of choosing that was the obvious wood quality difference, not the where or how the tree was felled and harvested. I'm sure there are two species of tree of similar abundance that also take the same time to harvest but have different properties making the potential for differing values exists out there somewhere. I just don't know of them off hand so can't cite it as an example to disprove your argument.

And you're free by what? 50? Still fucked to all hell.
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:41:13
Why do you call non-buyers free riders? Wouldn't that be the same as not getting on the ride?
I get non-adoption is a problem but your terminology confused me for a sec. I thought you meant people who were profiting off bitcoin but not adding any value to the network.

You can't separate utility and value idiot. Utility in part determines the value. Hence my whole point about resources having inherent value, utility being one facet of inherent value.
Lets take the mine out then leave it with only food. You can farm tomatoes or you can farm corn. They aren't going for the same price, as corn can also be made into alcohol while tomatoes cannot.
You want a world with only totmatoes or you want gold and alchohol?

I'm not even remotely an economist and I can tell what you're missing.
You can't claim money is just energy. It's also a placeholder for valuable resources. Sure some energy is spent to attain the resource but the resource has it's own inherent value. Meaning people would spend energy or trade a different resource for it. You're not spending your energy for that guy's energy, you're spending it for that gold or whatever the fuck it is.

Just git gud bro. The math will work itself out.
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:58:51
I'm coming after you before I go get that guy.
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:21:15
Would spending the bitcoin count as a capital gain and incur a tax? So you'd get taxed for paying your taxes? Or is there a stipulation precluding that?
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:00:31
Same goes for any currency. Just make sure to diversify after a certain point in savings....

If it's not you why give a shit. They got where they are by their own choices and on their own power.

It's the rate it's increasing isn't fast enough is the argument, not that it's not happening... come on man I have eyes here and a brain. That's not even my argument that's the other guy's don't strawman me bro.
You're not wrong about me being toxic, but you're implying I'm dumb enough to express that in the workplace. Brain up man, I'm being spiteful intentionally because your shit tone requires shit treatment in return and I'm in a medium that allows for that(sometimes). Your crass dismissal of the other guy is doing the same as me just without the word fuck in it. I'll take the check yourself before you wreck yourself tone when it's appropriate thank you very much.
I had the luxury of transparency due to invoices being publicly accessible. Employer charged exorbitant amount even considering overhead. For every guy like you. There's a guy like me. God forbid I be a lady lol that's a whole nother can of worms.
If you aggregate me I'm a part of the symptom, not the cause. If you don't then sure I'm the problem. Tackling both is still an option here and I'm willing if they are.
I'm still gonna say you can't make the claim you do without transparency to back it up. You're just stipulating at that point.
TLDR: You're saying "I'm being paid fairly" I'm responding with "Oh? Are you? Are you really?" you can get away with a "Yes I checked it's true bruh" and I'd be cool with that.
PS. Fair and lasse fair are not the same thing. So which are we talking about here?
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:32:57
At least pot would be legal nation wide. I'd probably make a decent living off growing and selling that shit.

Dude you're not winning this argument despite the cocky tone you're taking. You might have it good but that doesn't mean you're correct. You're just delusional because of your princess job queen royal fantasy castle situation.
Show me some paystubs from you and your peers and prove it fair or GTFO. Even better do that for the companies within walking distance from you too. Without transparency you can't make the claims you're making and expect them to hold up against over-arching statistical trends...
Oh you aren't willing to take a single step to prove anything? Just make the claim from your one perspective of billions? Cool man, expected nothing less.
