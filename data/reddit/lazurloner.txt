I am from Taiwan. I have tried this service a month ago.
It works like a charm, but the fee is a little bit higher than other exchanges in Taiwan. (Such as Maicoin,btcextw ,their buying price is cheaper)
But, it's the convenient store right? A place you buy stuff should be a little expensive then other shops.(with a instant deposit to your bitcoin wallet.)
one other thing, I think the buying process is a little bit complicated.(Even for a Taiwanese.)

I would like to share some of my experience,
I am a public transgender person currently working as a web engineer in Taiwan.
In the days when I wasn't so strong enough to come out as a transgender and fight back to the stereo type society in 2008, I faced lots of employment discrimination in Taipei. I have skills, but after 20-30 interviews and around 50 jobs applications in a 6 months time, I still can't get a job. I need to borrow money from my friend and even only have one meal a day with instant noodle.
But I still have internet access, because I have a cheap laptop ,so I can search for internet access in Taipei city (there are around 2000 access points for free WiFi in Taipei for now.)
My point is, when your money runs out, and you don't have more resource to fund your food(your life), your morals may not stand for long.
I won't lie to you, when the day I almost have nothing to eat, I really thought about something it not so moral as we say. But I didn't do it finally, because my moral still stops me.(because I am innocent, so I shouldn't be quality because what the society have done to me.) Actually I even try to comment suicide.(The reason I didn't do it, because at the night I try to do it, I suddenly thought "SHIT, it's not my fault, why should I take the consequence?")
After my very tough time, my partner and I started a transgender/intersex advocacy organization to help transgender and intersex people to fight with all kinds discrimination in all aspects around their life, because no one is helping them, I come from there, I knew it.

We are still in a very very early adoption stage here in Taiwan, only a handful shops accept Bitcoin, and two or three companies running business about Bitcoin.
