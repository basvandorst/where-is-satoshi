I think so too, it should be the AOL of crypto.
Furthermore usually the first mover in these new spaces rarely are the ones that lasts. From the Originals: How Non-Conformist Rule the World by Adam Grant:
"First mover advantage is a myth," Grant said to the TED audience - and brought the stats to prove it. In a comprehensive business study, 47% of first mover companies would fail in their early years compared to only 8% of so-called "improvers". Great examples include Facebook and Google, dominant startups that came years, if not a decade after their predecessors. "You don't have to be first. You have to be different and better."

Just out of curiosity, what app do you use on your site to accept bitcoin payments? Or you just give them your btc address?

Honestly the people in that forum will not adopt bitcoin because they have no need. When you talk about BTC adoption we need to look at the USE CASES. Anyone from a modern developed country has no use of BTC and will be defensive towards it. Now, elancers/upworkers from developing countries have a different opinion. People from Argentina, Indonesia, and other countries that have a more challenged banking system will have workers that love BTC, because it is safe, cheaper, and more easier to transfer money. Small plug here, coinpip.com is a money transfer payment service between companies and freelancers in developing countries. They are doing not too bad, and actually have traction. That is real adoption here. Elance/upwork will not go into BTC until it is too late.
