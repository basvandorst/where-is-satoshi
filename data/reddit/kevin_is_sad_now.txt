BTC is purchaseable all around the world by anyone with an online bank account/credit card. It's far more accessible than stock.

This is far more accessible to buy into for the average Joe and as such will hit critical mass earlier.

From 4500 to 4000. That's a dip, I don't care what you say.

This is don't expect things you read to make sense.

Crypto/Blockchain? yes; Bitcoin? no.

Your first question is interesting. Your second question shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how markets operate. 
The answer to your first question is that while it is possible that exchanges may have BTC liquidation issues if the vast majority of BTC is removed from exchanges,  it is incredibly unlikely imo as the majority are too lazy and will not take their BTC off exchanges. 
The answer to your second question is that if people remove bitcoin from exchanges, it means that they can not sell. That means supply is low. If supply is low and demand is unchanged or increases, then the price will rise, potentially by a lot depending on the number of people that remove BTC from exchanges that would otherwise sell.

Thanks for the explanation! Much appreciated.

I don't care about USAF or SegWit2X. *I* hope that BTC will do well as it helps propel ETH. I just thought USAF was a more favourable route as the miners appear quite greedy, but SegWit2X does seem like an adequate compromise.

As someone who's invested in ETH and not BTC, I visit here from time to time and this thread feels incredibly shilled for SegWit2x. Every other time I've visited it's been mostly pro-USAF. What's changed?
