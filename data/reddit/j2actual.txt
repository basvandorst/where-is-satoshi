Shouldn't of quit in the first place. Market is too volatile. I'd rather be ballin' and all I needed to do was stock milk.

The value is in having a group of people on a self-powered (consensus) technology that drives new innovation towards a decentralized future. The USD isn't backed by anything. Where does it's value come from? It comes from the unified agreement and trust that you can give a certain amount to someone in exchange for something else.

It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you withdraw from your paper wallet ONCE. Because once you use the private key, it's compromised. If you plan on holding for long-term investments, you cold store. If you plan on sending funds, use a hot wallet. If you plan on trading occasionally, keep it on a hot wallet or an exchange. Cryptocurrency isn't hack-proof. Use your head and store at your own risk.

She's not gonna DRASTICALLY change the bitcoin scene. It's a FACT that out of the MILLIONS of people who follow her, a percentage of those people will buy and another percentage of those people will talk to other people about it. People talk, those people talk, etc.

And why wouldn't you want people to become more interested in Bitcoin and in turn, be more interested in blockchain? Which is the whole design behind the consensys platform. More people = more global acceptance = separation from corrupt governments that rely on a system where people REQUIRE their fiat.
