I agree, it doesn't mean things will be perfect, but at least it's transparent. We can look at the code itself for answers and work on improving it rather than sitting on our hands wondering what the outcome of some corporate or bureaucratic mess will be and just how much of what they're telling us is lies.

I think it will continue to be an attractive investment/store of value for quite some time due to the first-mover advantage, limited supply, network effects, etc. But the original dream of using it as a currency is becoming more and more impractical, and things like smart contracts and other blockchain innovations have moved to more advanced platforms like Ethereum. Efforts to build such things as layer 2 solutions on top of Bitcoin are, IMO, too slow and limited in development and execution, and will be unable to compete.

At first I was more excited about it and wanted to tell people about this amazing revolutionary thing that is going to move economics and currency into a new era (and I still believe that), but at this point I tend to agree with you about not pushing it on people. If they happen to hear about it somewhere, seek it out on their own to understand it, and then start using it, they're more likely to use it properly and securely I think, and not get frustrated with it or panic buy/sell.
Also, we need to face the reality that this is a long-term thing. It's not going to go mainstream or be universally accepted for quite a while. In the meantime we have all the exchanges, go-between services, BTC debit cards and ATMs, etc to get us by. It's going to have to grow and adapt naturally.
In fact, it would be better to have less attention drawn to it in the beginning so that there is more time for problems to be solved and for it to become more stable and scalable. So far, many of the instances of market turbulence and bubbles/crashes have been largely due to public perceptions of Bitcoin, media attention, gov't actions and regulations, and scandals and incidents like Silk Road, the hacking of exchanges, the Mt. Gox incidents, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-15 07:33:45
To add to that advice: wait for the big swings, not the little ones. As others here pointed out, day trading with bitcoin is not recommended unless you're a super expert. I've been looking into it a lot recently myself and it just doesn't work well to buy and sell too quickly. 
So keep a constant eye on things, and make your move when the market takes a significant turn.

The Bitcoin client itself has an in-built option to encrypt the wallet. However, as pointed out elsewhere in this thread, you could still have malware that waits for you to enter your passphrase and then grabs that from memory. Safest would be an offline wallet created on a device never connected to the internet.

By that logic, we may as well abandon all involvement in cryptocurrencies, since they are too 'complicated and inconvenient' and have a very low number of people using them. 
The point is that these new crypto technologies offer advancements and improvements that old legacy systems could not (anonymity, fast transactions, low or no fees, trustless decentralized environments, smart contracts, etc etc). That's why people value them and invest in them, even though the user base is still small. It's a catch-22, sure, but we've already seen incredible growth in Bitcoin since its inception.

I did and I don't see any such 'tactics'. If anything, Gavin for one has been one of the most calm and reasonable voices in the midst of all this, and rather than set himself against Core, has been in support of everyone collaborating.

I'm not sure why people keep presenting it as Bitcoin vs. the Alts. Why can't multiple cryptocurrencies exist, for various purposes? There are many alts that have unique properties that Bitcoin will most likely never have, and that's not a bad thing. The diversity is great and allows for innovation.
Ethereum, for instance, is not really designed for the same purpose as Bitcoin and its currency Ether was made as a convenient way to help things in the network run (as I understand it), rather than an outright currency or 'digital gold' like Bitcoin.

Concerning this, does anyone know of a good way to recover your passphrase if it is very long? I looked into hash cracking software but they all had character limitations that my passphrase exceeds. I'm fairly certain about what the whole passphrase is so it was probably a minor mistyping when I first entered it or something. Would rather not give it to someone else to crack into for obvious security reasons

You seem to have strict requirements when it comes to consensus. But realistically there is no 100% consensus on anything. There will always be an opposition, a minority. If you waited for this complete consensus you'd be waiting a very long time and the software would become obsolete since it would not be able to dynamically and organically scale and respond to issues.
Besides, who exactly are the official members of this 'consensus' that apparently must reach unanimous agreement for anything to change? The Core devs? All devs? The Bitcoin end-users? The miners? All of the above? Who defines who gets a vote and who doesn't?
The fact is, whatever the miners mine and the nodes relay is what ends up being truth. Consensus is emergent from the actions of the players involved. No one can dictate it. If someone were no longer 'allowed' to make their own fork, it would be a clear sign that Bitcoin was no longer decentralized.

Except they don't 'control' anything any more than the Core devs do. People don't have to use their software. Indeed, if Classic doesn't gain enough support it may fail, just like XT. It's always a possibility either way.
@_date: 2016-01-29 18:47:05
This is what I'm beginning to think as well. I doubt the 2mb fork would be 'contentious' or difficult to do if Core simply had it as part of their scaling plan.
I know they keep saying they want to wait until a bunch of other things fall into place to do an increase fork, but that puts it too far in the future. With it being so indefinite and having no set dates or delineated prerequisites for a block size increase, the miners are going to run out of patience and begin patching an increase themselves (as they've now stated they will do).
@_date: 2016-01-05 10:41:03
Don't let the haters and ignorance get to you man, keep doing what you're doing if it works so well. Personally if I were you I'd keep the money in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies due to the poor recent performance of things like gold and the terrible characteristics of fiat monies (can't believe people were actually telling you to simply convert to gov't-backed money - ridiculous). 
That said, it would be smart to also keep an eye on the price of Bitcoin and have a plan for trading it for something else in case it takes a big dive. Shouldn't be a problem for the most part though as Bitcoin will most likely steadily rise in value long term.
If you're looking for more investment type options you could get into stocks, precious metals, etc. or even invest in alternate cryptocurrencies such as by buying CoinoIndex. But be very careful with investing, do your research, and never invest more than you're willing to lose since anything can happen. What options are open to you though might depend on your age and location.

I agree, and I never gamble. At the time I was out of a job and quite desperate to find any way to make money. And yes, I know that was an incredibly stupid way to try to make money. Hindsight is 20/20.
It was also an earlier era for Bitcoin, one where it still felt new and experimental, and the price was of course much lower. I recognized the potential for it to be an investment, but not nearly as clearly as I do now. So it wasn't entirely out of the question to 'fritter it away' on games and various sites.
@_date: 2016-06-09 15:36:16
Interesting read. I think Bitcoin's transparency is generally a good thing since it makes things easily verifiable, but the only way to stay anonymous with it is to never associate IDs with addresses (which as the post points out is hard to do when you're interacting with regulated exchanges and companies).
The paragraph about law enforcement regulating at least 51% of the hashpower is strange though. If they're able to basically control a majority of hashpower, then we have much bigger problems than transaction censorship. At that point the network would no longer be decentralized and people would lose trust. This is already a concern today of course, with the increasing consolidation of hashpower in a few big companies and groups.

This has been a concern of mine for a while. Now that we've gotten past some things like segwit and the hard fork, it will be interesting to see if the miner centralization problems are addressed.

True, that's one way to look at it; can't put the genie back in the bottle.

I agree that the current financial structures are very ingrained in our society, and that adoption right now involves interacting with those structures. However, I think truly decentralized, censorship-resistant cryptos will continue to exist as well in some form. They may be relegated to largely black market activities, perhaps, but the freedom to use them (and thus the freedom from centralized gov't and financial systems) will be there.

To me, a decentralized system is more akin to a creature that regenerates no matter what part of it you attack (unless you manage to attack a majority of it at once).
@_date: 2017-04-29 16:26:01
Scaling is important, but I think the deeper issue is mining centralization. The current drama with these big mining groups would be a non-issue if it were more decentralized. And I realize that probably means changing the PoW algorithm, which makes people uncomfortable since it's a major change to the protocol. But the alternative of growing miner cartels is much worse. Frankly, for a system predicated and founded on principles of decentralization, it's unacceptable that the issue has been ignored this long.
@_date: 2017-04-15 19:10:03
I'd say the tweet is describing some form of direct democracy. Either way, Bitcoin is really closer to free market as you mentioned, or [Voluntarism]( Miners and nodes can run whatever code they want, and are not necessarily bound under the tyranny of the majority.
@_date: 2016-02-09 16:30:26
With Bitcoin it's better not to wait; you never know what will happen next. I'd just buy periodically as others suggest.
The price has certainly lost strength due to concerns over the block controversy, but who knows where it will end up, or what would take place during/after a potential hardfork or the halving.
@_date: 2017-04-19 23:37:15
Did you read OP's article? It's not FUD; it even references the article you linked to several times. Both articles are basically going over the same topics and material regarding AML requirements, Taiwan banks, Wells Fargo, etc.
@_date: 2017-04-16 21:11:46
I just meant that there has been an obvious lack of consensus (agreement) in the Bitcoin community for the last couple years, especially regarding scaling and governance. If it's true that universal consensus is required for any progress to be made, then it appears we'll be waiting a long time. Bitcoin will continue to stagnate, and if both segwit and block size increases fail to be adopted, then it will be useful as neither a p2p cash system nor a settlement layer, and the value would likely drop. Vaunted properties like consensus governing would be moot at that point.
@_date: 2016-02-24 16:29:33
Good article. It's sad that the mining power is so centralized that you could actually hold meetings with a handful of people who represent most of it.
On the other hand we still have decentralized network nodes to counteract that. Just hope we can keep them that way.

It's hard to wrap my head around that. Why would anyone be fine with Bitcoin's current situation? It doesn't work well as a p2p cash system, it doesn't work as a settlement layer, it doesn't have features like smart contracts or true fungibility/anonymous transactions, and most of all there is an obvious centralization issue on the mining side. And if adoption rises while no scaling proposals are successful, the network will just get much slower and more expensive to participate in.

Yep. Same with the miners - I don't see why it's surprising to people that they'd follow economic incentives rather than be solely altruistic. After all, isn't it a central principle of Bitcoin to have a 'trustless' system that assumes and prepares for malicious/self-serving actions?
@_date: 2016-02-23 10:36:12
That's only part of the story though. They may have technical expertise, but what about economic? To me, that seems to be what this whole block size debate is about: one side making an engineering argument, the other making an economics argument.
And both probably believe they're the ones preserving Satoshi's vision, whether by protecting the code and system he created on the one hand, or by protecting the freedoms and economic principles Bitcoin was made for on the other. The truth is probably somewhere in between, and it's sad that there can't be more compromise.
@_date: 2016-02-23 16:37:01

Not sure about UASF but I agree on the 95% consensus part. Never gonna happen. With the rift as big as it is at this point, to me it seems the best solution would be a 'clean split' kind of fork (i.e. with replay protection in place). Unfortunately, neither side wants to implement replay protection, for fear of becoming the weak 'altcoin' chain that dies out. But I see no other way forward. We may see a split happen anyways if either segwit or EC become adopted somehow, and the other group is frustrated enough to leave and work on a different chain.

I don't know (I got the same email and didn't understand that part either), but I've been with CryptoXChange for a while now and have been unable to be a 'verified' user. I submitted the documents 1-2 months ago and when I log in it still says 'Status: Unverified.'

I know he's been drastically downvoted, but I find that themusicgod1's comments can't just be ignored, and bring up some good points. I would add the question: (speaking to those whose computers are being unknowingly used in this manner) is this 'stealing' of your resources any worse than the stealing of your money that the government does (and which you willingly submit to), or the control over your life that so many other agencies hold? In the long run, if this mining supports the BitCoin economy, that may very well be helping decentralized systems such as BitCoin become more popular and replace the current inefficient and corrupt banking and economic systems.
Look at it this way: would you try to stop someone who was stealing from people if he was using that money to liberate those people from oppression and secure a better system wherein they may all be more wealthy? Of course, I'm not claiming that OP is necessarily 'heroic' or has any such motivation. It's just something to be considered. It's essentially similar to the age-old ethical dilemma of whether you choose to kill someone if that means that you'll be saving others by doing so.

Your comment about IT staff reminded me that currently (at least here in America) a huge chunk of the economy is in finance. Large numbers of employees work at banks, credit card companies, insurance, loans, etc. But Bitcoin lessens the need for these kinds of things. What if... (gasp) switching to Bitcoin would provoke more people to actually craft/produce unique, tangible goods and services instead of making money off of increasingly valueless money?

On the contrary, I thought it was objectively laid out and one of the best Bitcoin articles I've read in some time. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:44:54
You know, I wonder how history will remember this great debate, not to mention all the personalities involved. I used to lean towards the 'big blocks' camp, but articles like this have shown me that things are not so simple as raising a block size limit. However, as far as how the arguments and drama have unfolded, I still think that both sides have displayed abysmal and destructive behaviour. And while Bitcoin has been stuck in these doldrums, other coins are sweeping in to take the lead in innovation.
Perhaps this chaos is unavoidable when there is no longer clear leadership for the project to look to. I don't think having that again would compromise decentralization either; after all, the protocol is run voluntarily, and if the users/developers/miners disagree with the direction it's going, they can always choose to fork, move their business to another chain or coin, etc. That's the beauty of this new Cryptocurrency based economy, and something that contrasts starkly with the enforced monopolies of fiat systems.
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:44:25
It's a trade-off. A question of whether you value decentralization or attack resistance more.

Is this a copypasta or something?

That used to be more true, but lately I think many of them are in bubbles of their own. Ripple and Stellar became way over-inflated after news of potential adoption by banks.
Then there's the ICO craze, which is probably the biggest and most dangerous sector at the moment honestly. People are dumping money into these startups without caring much whether they are legit or will ever deliver on their promised products and services. There are some solid ones though. I hold some DigixDAO, Golem, and Augur tokens but am very cautious about the rest.

Wow, now I feel old. Been following Bitcoin since around 2010 and I remember this event being pretty well known as the first time someone bought something with BTC. But I just realized Bitcoin newcomers in the last couple years may not know about history like that, especially with most sites and forums being dominated by the scaling debates.
@_date: 2016-05-31 17:45:42
One big reason is that there are dollars involved, and transferring dollars is not as simple as transferring cryptos. Also escrow/dispute resolution/scam prevention can get complicated.
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:12:28
Bottom line, do your research and if you believe a cryptocurrency project has long term use and value, then buy and hold it.
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:21:18
Little bit of exaggeration probably. With how quickly things can change in crypto it often feels like you've gained or lost significant amounts overnight

Maybe that's the point of the board, to point out how much things have changed since 2010 and how Bitcoin has become more of an investment or store of value now

Problem is that we just dipped below that support. We'll have to see where we go from here but considering that and the fact that we can't seem to get past the 460's recently, the strong upward breakout many were expecting is not doing so well. Who knows with Bitcoin though, could go anywhere at any time.

I don't usually get that response; it's often more that they don't understand the whole blockchain thing, or that they don't see the value in something that's just digital. People like to have something physical they can hold.

I agree. I think the current situation is nothing compared to what will happen if we see some progress on the scaling front.

That is a weird-sounding phrase, especially considering Bitcoin's crypto-anarchist roots...
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:42:53
I realize that. I was just pointing out that it is possible to run a node. I'm sure I could do it the 'slow' way as well and it would still work.

Yep, this is why I'm glad I financed my car. As much as I hate debt/credit/loans and want to have it paid off, that money would be better spent right now investing in things like stocks and cryptos.
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:29:35
Doesn't matter. It's up to the miners and users what code to run in the end. That's also why I'm fine with the fact that the ethereum hard fork happened. It's everyone's right to decide to continue running that version or switch to a different one (ethereum classic, etc.).

Don't feel bad about questions man; we're all learning and cryptocurrencies are a new and often confusing field. There are some good links on the sidebar to read through, but for buying I think the easiest way to get started would be [LocalBitcoins]( It's a site where people make listings for buying/selling coins. Choose an offer with your preferred payment method from someone with a good rating, follow the instructions, and you'll be on your way.
If you'd rather go with a regulated and insured company, [Coinbase]( and [Gemini]( are some of the more well-known and reputable exchanges and are pretty simple to use. You will have to go through a longer process of identity and bank verification though.
For storing coins long term, you'll want something secure and foolproof like a hardware wallet. [Ledger]( and [Trezor]( are the most often recommended ones.
There are also dedicated 'beginner' subreddits for cryptos like and I recommend learning a bit about Ethereum, not as a 'competitor' to Bitcoin, but as a complementary blockchain with interesting features/use cases of its own and a strong development and user community.
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:08:09
No, it just makes people ragequit from using the coin at all (which is not a good thing for value and stability). We need a way to have small transactions and low fees. I used to lean more towards on-chain scaling (i.e. increasing block size) but at this point I'm fine with side chains and state channels if it means getting out of this rut and making some progress.
@_date: 2016-07-27 09:03:27
SERENITY NOW!

Indeed. Even total marketcap doesn't tell the whole story though as there is circulating vs. non-circulating supply, pre-mined coins, etc.

No Millennials? Are we looking at the same charts? I see a lot of them on there. Keep in mind that as quoted, Millennials were born mostly *before* the year 2000. The idea is that they come of age around the time of the Millennium.
@_date: 2017-06-27 23:40:56
Exactly. The introduction of blockchain based cryptocurrencies doesn't  give the government any new tools for gaining more power. But it does empower and give freedom to individuals (which is the goal of course).

@_date: 2017-06-20 21:37:20
It's always puzzling to me that this is one of the questions I get most when I introduce people to cryptos. I guess they're thinking of it like stocks. When they hear the current price per coin, they seem to think it's become too expensive to buy some.

How would they be 'locked into the network' without blocks? That's the reason for having a blockchain, it's a ledger of the transactions.

There are some like bit, finney, and satoshi.

The article is full of inaccuracies and leaps of logic. For instance:


This is not how mining difficulty works at all. Changes in network hashrate, not the length of the blockchain, are what lead to difficulty changes.
@_date: 2013-03-05 01:26:04
As far as I know it's the miners that get that.

They can. Don't let this deter you; it's really just an example of being ultra-careful and going for absolute maximum security. It would be like buying an indestructible, impenetrable safe to store your gold (and hiding it and never letting anyone know it even exists).
You should be fine if you simply encrypt the wallet with a long password and then store it, like snakemcgraw says, within an encrypted TrueCrypt container/hard drive (these are pretty easy to make with the TrueCrypt program) with another long password and possibly with selecting the option of two cascading algorithms (again, it's easier than it sounds - the program walks you through it).
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:33:40
The thing is, nothing like this has ever happened on this scale before, so we don't really know how long it will keep growing, or how much. There's no reference point; it's all speculation.
@_date: 2013-03-05 02:07:45
The whole reason we need companies like BitSpend to be the middlemen is because online retailers have largely not accepted Bitcoins yet.

@_date: 2013-12-11 22:48:12
Seems like Bitcoin will always have users though, especially considering the actions of modern governments regarding currencies and economies. I don't think it will ever 'drop to 0.' Sure, it may fall pretty low; who knows. But it is definitely here to stay, in some form or another. Perhaps as it grows to larger scales a weakness will be seen and it will be replaced by some other cryptocurrency, or multiple ones will be used. But either way, we are witnessing the birth of a new era of currency and commerce.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:47:27
I'd rather have those problems than the problems that come with a currency full of inflation like the USD.

One benefit, I imagine, would be time and convenience. Instead of having to find an exchange or something like coinbase to turn my Bitcoins into dollars (sometimes this takes a long time or there can be hangups in the processes) so I can buy something from a site that doesn't yet accept Bitcoins, I can simply have the people at BitSpend buy it for me and send them the Bitcoins.

I believe sea-steading is the answer. If you're over 200 miles from the nearest shoreline, you don't have to worry about any country's regulations or laws. You can establish your own country or society. I've thought for a while now that this would be a great way to build experimental mini-societies to test things, much like Larry Page is talking about. The problem is the high cost of such a venture. Internet connectivity is another problem. I imagine large companies like Google would love the idea of having their headquarters in such an isolated place though - there would be no taxes.
@_date: 2013-03-05 01:18:48
In case anyone's looking for a good VPN that accepts Bitcoin, I've been using Mullvad for several months now and I really like their service. The connection is a little slow (although that's pretty normal for vpn's due to their nature), but reliable. They accept Bitcoin and their prices are very low (I noticed it ends up being even cheaper to pay with Bitcoin than with credit card). I personally use OpenVPN with their service instead of the program Mullvad provides, but that's up to personal preference I guess.
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:19:47
I meant that there would be no taxes imposed by the country whose land you're on (such as property taxes, income tax, etc.) since you're on your own 'land' far away from any other country, and you've probably renounced citizenship as well. There would still be costs associated with things like importing and exporting, of course, and you might have difficulty setting up trade and business with other countries, but it might be possible.
@_date: 2013-03-02 03:48:46
Exactly. There's no need to worry, because the aesthetics will inevitably come along with more widespread adoption of BitCoin (which I think is also inevitable, given BitCoin's history so far and the fact that many people have realized it's not just some silly virtual play-money).

Way to go, you found something in my history. Unfortunately, it's entirely irrelevant.


Not having regulation doesn't mean everything will be unsafe or disastrous. It just means that the free market will take care of those things automatically. I a given product is unsafe, people will stop buying it, and the company will be forced to make something else or go out of business, etc.
If someone *does* continue to use or buy the unsafe product, that's their problem. People should be responsible for their own actions.

Unfortunately, you can't just 'tap into' the undersea lines. You have to have a connection to one of the coastline datacenters.
