If you write often, read regularly, and are passionate and knowledgeable about a subject, I’d be concerned if you *couldn’t* articulate a meaningful rebuttal to what was basically a fluff piece. OP wrote something very earnest, but it’s equally sophomoric. He means well, but is utterly out of his gourd. So here we have someone informed and knowledgeable who comes along and thoroughly sets right these, uh, misguided cheerleading endeavors on OP’s part.
For any major field of human endeavor—art, politics, philosophy, economy, whatever the fuck else you can name—there exists a field of study. There will be generations of experts whose knowledge is built upon previously established foundations, one step up the ladder at a time. You know how we learn the scientific method in school? It should be no surprise that economists have something similar. Any respected field of study will have agreed-upon models of learning. It’s simply easier to work on a professional level with complicated information and interacting systems if you agree upon tested nomenclature and methods of understanding.
Professionals and dedicated enthusiasts for any endeavor, even cryptocurrency, appreciate the distinction between a feel-good fluff piece full of psychobabble and arguments written from someone who at least paid enough attention in macroeconomics class to, say, remember the basic rules for currency. And they hate the spreading of misinformation. Though I will say this was an above-average, noteworthy takedown. Measured and thorough.
