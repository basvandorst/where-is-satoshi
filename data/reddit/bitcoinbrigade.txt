Hello Everyone!
We'd like to introduce ourselves to the community.
Our small team is growing and we're hoping to roll out a series of updates as we Journey through the Wonderful World of Bitcoin together! 
We are HQd currently in the Champaign Urbana area of Illinois in the United States but have a multitude of remote representatives across the globe. 
Our Mission is this: Believe in the Betterment of Our Future Community...or...BitBooFC! 
We've been to Lendit 2017 in Manhattan learning about the potential benefits of Blockchain Fintech and are looking forward to Consensus in May, as well as; more conferences, meetups, and seminars in the coming years! 
A big event we're going to be a part of is Oregon Eclipse, a music and arts festival with tickets that can only be purchased with Bitcoin! This world encompassing event will begin a wave for the future of community. 
We'd love to bring on partnerships, sponsorships, active community members, and potential clients as we move through our three year plan that will bring us to be active representatives at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 and subsequent Olympic Games.
Beyond the next decade our rollouts will be global and encompass a multitude of digital landscape architectures, physical commodity &amp; mineral trading, press coverage and live community updates, educational games, &amp; chat!
If you have any questions as to who we are and what we can do for you feel free to drop us a line on here or visit our site's Barracks!
