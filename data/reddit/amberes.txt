If you dont live in a region with really cheap  electricy you won't be able to make profits mining bitcoin. If you want to mine look for other currencies.

Actually, I didn't pay attention to it, it wasn't mentioned anywhere. Calculating with the bitcoinprice advertised in that moment (1BTC=286,89) I think they took 0,12mBTC in fee. 
(I got 17,30mBTC for 5€ instead of 17,42mBTC, so 0,03cent for a 5euro transaction)(if my math isn't off)
edit: [looked it up]( and apparently they say they ask for a 5% fee (3weeks ago, so it could have changed)

Just to give a bit more info about it:
Téléfonica was the national phone company, before it got privatised. It's still the biggest ISP/telecommunicationsprovider  in Spain, and with their international expansion they're the 6th largest one in the world. 
They organized a Bitcoin-talk with as speakers:
* Amuda Goueli, the Ceo of destinia.com, an online travel agency and the first one to accept bitcoin. 
* Javier Maestre, lawyer specialized in technology, wrote a couple of articles about bitcoins and will talk about the legal aspects of bitcoin.
* Alberto Gomez Toribio, a programmer working on a p2p exchange.
* Jorge Abascal, cofounder of Pagobit, the first bitcoin payment processor in Spain. 
The discussion is moderated by Jorge Ordovás, an informatics engineer, currently appointed to the financial business services in the new businesses area of Téléfonica
I think it looks promising that Telefonica paid quite some attention to Bitcoin, hope they'll start using it soon. Going to start watching it now.

It was really easy and fast, no id/login/... required, got my money instantly. After I went to that little shop to buy some candy. They use Bitpay to process the transaction. I was the second customer paying with bitcoin, but it's location is far from the citycenter. Would love to see some more shops/bars here using bitcoin.

I'm using bitstamp for years now and never had any problems, but I also didnt transfer an amount that big. I did use wiretransfers more than once.
I guess they're not answering because they're still working trough the backlog of december-januari. I'm sure they'll sort it out and you'll get your money back, just fucked up that in the meantime you can't use it :/
There is a contact phonenumber now (+44 20 8133 5474), don't know how much they charge for it.
Still not really professional of them

Do you have all your money in your wallet in your pocket? :)
If im not wrong, every wallet has 100 addresses, where he could have those bitcoins, and you can make as many wallets as you want.

second part:
* **Q:**just put something like "For more recent information please also read my reddit-posts where I try to keep everyone updated as often as possible &lt;insert link here&gt;" 
**A:**ok thx will do it 
* **Q:**are EUR/SEPA deposits made after shutdown to german account safe? i`ve sent some, did not recieve any message confirming, service is down...any info appreciated. thx 
**A:**deposits are clear. after we are online again, the funds will be added to the user accounts 
* **Q:**my most pressing question: for how much money can TAiS46 sue the German government for closing his accounts, keeping him out of doing business for a week, without even asking him once? 
**A:**good question, I will see it, after the bank account is open again and my lawyer will tell it to me ;) 
* **Q:**Can we get an official confiramation at least in email that how much are Frozen EUR balance is? Than we could sue the bank one by one... 
**A:**on the polish bank account are still 3.5 million eur frozen 
* **Q:**Ich glaube du kannst auch deutsch schreiben und es würde irgendjemand übersetzen. Denk bitte dran den "fremdcode" auf hintertüren zu prüfen.. es gab schon einmal einen zwischenfall mit fremdcode. btw falls du probleme mit der datenbank bekommst kannst du mir ne nachricht schicken (CoinSheep @ reddit) ich hab im beruf tägl. mit datenbanken mit &gt;10mill. rows zu tun. nur ein angebot ;) 
**A:**alles klar danke :) 
* **Q:**We need an email about or closing balances INDIVIDUALLY. Like brokerage firms send out those letters with balances. That would be a proof for us as a start to sue the polish bank 
**A:**the BZWBK is still accepting the EUR! 
* **Q:**why are your banks still accepting deposits 
**A:**the only think to not accept EUR is to close the bank account :) 
* **Q:**how many users do you have? 
**A:**over 20k 
* **Q:**thanks for the updates and not running away with our money at the first sign of problems, due to that I will gladly trade again at btc24 once it's open good luck 
**A:**what would i do with the users money? i a buy something, i must everytime think, that it is not my money, and this is really NO happy life! and this was not the goal of bitcoin / bitcoin-24!! 
* **Q:**Who froze the account(s)? Polizei, Staatsanwaltschaft, BaFin? 
**A:**kriminalpolizei bremen 
* **Q:**
**A:**wenn jemand übersetzen kann: die kriminalpolizei in bremen hat die kündigung des kontos der commerzbank gefordert. desweiteren hat sie um mithilfe in polen gebeten, da transaktionen von polen nach deutschland zur commerzbank gingen. die polen baten ihre hilfe an und haben das konto für 72 stunden gesperrt. später hat ein staatsanwalt in polen entschieden, das konto für MAXIMAL 3 monate zu sperren. gegen diese sperrung hat man 7 tage zeit einspruch ein legen. dieser ist erfolgt und wir warten auf eine antwort 
the police in bremen forced the commerzbank to cancel the contract with simon, they also asked poland for help in this case and they decided to close the account for 72 hours, after this they decided to close it for maximum 3 months but you simon can go against it within 7 days... 
* **Q:** for 2.0 , will you introduce a verification procedure like currently exist for trading Eur at he largest exchange? 
**A:**not sure atm … i must clear it with my lawyer 
* **Q:**Can you let us know the exact date when the Commerzbank closed the account? 
**A:**17. june 2013 … my lawyer will extend it 
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:10:31
That happened last week or two weeks ago on bitcoin-24 as well, a couple of users lost their coins like that. Don't know if they got refunded, but at least they disabled clickable links in the chat. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 09:50:01
Nobody knows.

@_date: 2013-04-16 10:26:25
Started to sort out the questions and answers, shitty formatting sorry:
* **Q:**
**A:** first: I am working to get out the BTC from your accounts. little login page with the withdrawal function. but I must reset all password, because much people logged in into a scam page -.- 
* **Q:**The new server is ok again? 
**A:**yes all fine 
* **Q:**how was the trade rollback implemented, was everything rolled back to a certain point in time or was it more surgical? 
**A:**only the trades wich where made double 
* **Q:**was there trading after the site went offline? (api?) 
**A:**not directly but after a few hours 
* **Q:**the withdraw site you are working on, will you reset the passwords? 
**A:**i must as i said. some users logged in into a scam site and they steal the password from the users. or I will make an email / sms confirmation like it was. 
* **Q:**is there anything we as users/customers can do to speed up the process of unfreezing the bank account(s)? 
**A:**i will ask my lawyer if you can directly write to poland or something 
* **Q:**A lot of people also would like to know who is legally reprensenting you or at least have an official statement. Indeed until there we can unfortunately only blindly trust you. 
**A:**i am in contact everyday with my lawyer. i can not publish much news at this moment he says. I will ask him if I can publish the information from my lawyer. we had some people sittig in poland (WDR TV) and maybe we will make a press release on the newspaper, we have also contact to internet press and will also publish later there some information, but first we must get back the BZWBK bank account 
* **Q:**What about users that had BTC withdrawals pending, and approved through email or sms, but have not received the funds in their wallet? Also not after the strange refill today. Do those funds appear back in your system? Or are they stuck in the payout queue waiting for another hotwallet refill? 
**A:**I must think about it. maybe I will reset this withdrawals. it should be better i think if someone pay an invoice with this bitcoins and the bitcoins will then double send or something like this. 
* **Q:**Is it possible for you to post all the communication between you and the banks and lawyers and everything? (Of course removing any personal info) 
**A:**i must ask my lawyer tomorrow 
* **Q:**
**A:**little information. i THINK the biggest exchange has the same problems but i am not sure and can tell it to 100%! i have contact with the CEO and the lawyer of them 
* **Q:**Some of us are scared these money laundering charges are serious and the Polish account will stay frozen for a long time, what makes you confident you can get it back? 
**A:**the bank account was first closed for 72 hours! i got no informations from my bank and think it was only a techical issue. after that I got the information, what my bank account is closed for 3 month now! but we had 7 days to make an objection! and as I can read, the polish bank has no reason to close the bank account. I will censor some lines in the mail from them and publish it tomorrow! 
* **Q:**Will you add a verification system in the future as suggested by some users on Reddit? Would make sense I think 
**A:**if we had a verification in the past, the same thing did be happen, i am sure ;) 
* **Q:**check the censored version with your lawyer before , better release one day later but sure they cant take action against you because of that 
**A:**sure, i will do it
* **Q:**What did you mean by saying "It is time for something new. A new big business and a very serious Company, which can not be fuc* * * ! We will be back for sure!" Are you considering closing bitcoin24 and starting a new exchange 
**A:**no, not closing btc24, but we have new partners, good lawyer which will make an bank account with us together, make new contracts with the banks specified to bitcoin and so on! we also planning new projects, but this has no priority at this moment. the first think is to get the bank account bank!!! 
* **Q:**if an ETA for the different stages isn't viable right now, could we at least stipulate that you'll give a short-term schedule before certain functions of the site come back online? (as not to surprise people and catch them off guard) 
**A:**my lawyer told me, that it is no good idea to tell an ETA. If i say friday, and the bank account is not open, the people will start to fight again ;) 
* **Q:**maybe you have answered this, but when can we expect to get our btc back. 
**A:**yes, we are workin on it and try to publish a withdrawal page tomorrow 
* **Q:**Would it help if all users sent you "verification" material (ID, proff of residency, origin of moneu) ? 
**A:**I don't think that it would help and it has also not helped in the past 
* **Q:**Did I understand it right, that you're planning to resume trading? I really liked you're platform and i find it extremely important that there is an alternative to mtgox. Also when you're talking about btc24 2.0 what exactly do you mean? Total rewrite? If so, what do you expect when it will be launched? (Just a rough estimate: week, month, year?) 
**A:**yes, someone is working on 2.0 but it will be more performance, not much change in the system. maybe a little design change 
* **Q:**what about SEPA sent to the PL bank last week ? 
**A:**they will be deposit on your account asap the page is online again 
* **Q:**what about open orders? are they canceled, or do you you plan to let users cancel them? 
**A:**i must think about it. maybe i will start the page without traing function for 12 hours. so the users can cancel the orders and place new one. after that the traing will start again, or i will cancel all trades before starting 
* **Q:**
**A:**i am trying really really everythiny to bet BTC24 online! i am traveling around the "world" to lawyer in poland, germany and clear all thinks. i am only at my mobile phone and trying to reach something 
* **Q:**i'd really urge you to consider the withdrawing thing.. if it turns out, that money is lost in the polish account, it might be fairer, to let all users share the losses, not only the ones that were on EUR at the second it happend, or the ones that deposited money that wasn't put into there account fast enough 
**A:**sure, if the account is blocked for 3 month or more, I will tell you, but just to let all know 2.000.000 € are safe on another bank account ;) If the polish bank will not release the bank account, i am still able to pay the users (not all but maybe some % of all funds available in the users balance) 
* **Q:**
**A:** just to let you know, my lawyer told me that i can publish the information. where are about 5.000.000 EUR frozen atm 
* **Q:**Did not quite understand: What about our rest Euros in btc24? Can we buy coins and withdraw it? 
**A:**no, you can't but btc atm for it! 
* **Q:**Who do you think credited the hotwallet with 450BTC if it was not you? Was would be his interest? I don't get it 
**A:**i really don't know who it was! it was also not the address from the second hot wallet / offline wallet! 
* **Q:**you had also private bitcoins? what about selling (some) of them when they freeze the account for 3 months? 
**A:**if they really froze the bank account for 3 month! I will sell my private bitcoins for you money. I will think about, how I will handle it. maybe that the user can only exchange some % of their money to BTC … but i must also ask my lawyer what he says about this. 
* **Q:**Can you still see the account balance and the money arriving to the PL bank ? 
**A:**yes i can 
* **Q:**can't you just ask your banks to reverse the payments 
**A:**asked, but they will not do it! i am not able to do any transaction on this bank account anymore 
* **Q:**i know that its very private information, and totally understand if you dont wanna tell.. but how much btc could you spend for that? so is it only a few %, or can we be sure to get a large amount (&lt;75%) of our money back? 
**A:**I will not tell how much BTC i am holding private. but i can tell, that it is not 5.5 million EUR ;) 
* **Q:**
**A:**if the money is really frozen for 3 month! ALL OF YOU have the chance to write an mail to the government. I will give you than more informations. but 3 month is the maximal time!!! 
* **Q:**Everyone would cool down a little if you could at least partially pay out EUR withdrawals from the other bank account right off. Than many wont sue you and even wait 3 months 
**A:**the german bank account it canceled by the bank without reason! and there is a low limit for online transactions. it was only a backup bank account where i can access 2.5 million EUR. i will use them to withdraw EUR if the bzwbk bank account will stay frozen! but I must clear this things with my lawyer and how to do it 
* **Q:** what about transactions before turning off webist ? If i sold my btc there were sold or not ? I got 3x euro for that trade, does it mean i still have that bitcoins, or i have sold them and got correct euro amount ? 
**A:**they will be canceled and are restored. 
* **Q:**one last question than i'm totally statisfied ;) Why did you prefered to release informations ons reddit instead of your website? i wasn't really sure if it was the real tais posting there because so many people tried to fake you/btc24 in the last few days. 
**A:**i think that in reddit and irc are the most people. you can see my english is not the best. i am waiting for a good text / statement from some english speaking guy to publish it on the site! 
* **Q:**ok.. I wish you good luck with all this. You seem to be a really good guy.. according to your posts you're a really bad coder, and you might have been way to naive for this, but at least you're an idealist and believe in what you're doing. 
**A:**i know about the coding ;) but i have now some one, who will code for me :) all is fine now with the code 
* **Q:**how far back in time transactions are reset? 
**A:**my programmer does it, i does not check it, but i think he only restored the double made trades 
* **Q:**I received a SEPA withdrawal confirmation email on April 4 but I haven't received the money. Is the money safe? 
**A:**the money is safe and I know wich transactions are not leaving the bank account! they will be reset!

I bought some coins on bitcoin-24.com, and plan on not selling them anytime soon. Should I transfer them to my bitcoin-qt app? Can I leave them there? What's the safest? (noob here..)

Why 'out of the game'? Nothing new, site is down, but I think Simon still plans to put bit24 back online asap, no?
