How much do you need?

Since we're already discussing security related features; how about two-factor authentication using Google Authenticator?

Only pro users get HTTPS. Wtf.

I recommend you contact them and ask for something in writing, don't assume they "have to" send this to you.

Actually, you can sign up anonymously and just not go through any of the steps required to verify your account. Not having a verified account means you cannot buy or sell, but you can still store, send, and receive.

Can you share that script?

Maybe he's just worried that Mt. Gox will stay silent forever and keep his coins hostage.

I'd imagine that law enforcement would want to catch the vendors and don't care too much about the buyers.

I wonder how legal this is. I mean, you're talking about money laundering in most cases.

The design on its own looks great. When mashed up with the image I gave as a template, I start to question a few things.
I'm not sure about the guilloche on the right. I do want to keep the QR code, though. I'll give you a wallet address later that we can create a QR code from. The Bitcoin logo doesn't look too good next to the blue bank logo. Maybe because of the font and style, or because it's not on the same line. Not sure if anything can be done about this, though. Thoughts?

I should add that my debit card is not square. The width/length of the card is 8.5 cm and height is 5.4 cm, so the design will have to fit that.

An insecure server setup will put anyone at risk, whether they are running .onion or .com. The way the admins operated was what got them caught, not the fact that they were running the site as a Tor hidden service (and they didn't run a .onion from the beginning, fwiw).

Hm, I did not receive an email where tons of other people were Cc'ed. I only got an email form Intersango explaining and apologizing for the leak.

I really like the color scheme, but parts of the design clashes with the text on the card. Keep in mind that the top left corner of the card will have the bank's blue and white logo on it.
I'm not sure about the size of the guilloche on the left; I believe the text on the card will get in the way and ruin things. The bottom 2.5 cm of the card is reserved for text (card number, my name etc).
The QR on the right side will get in the way of the last four digits of the card number. The card number is right below the card's chip, which according to this design will be printed on top of the left guilloche.

I have heard good things about  but never actually tried it myself. Look for reviews on the bitcoin forum.

If you want to buy bitcoins anonymously, use a prepaid debit card. And tie it all to an email account that is not associated with the "real" you in any way.
