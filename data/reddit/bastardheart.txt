Same, people find out I'm involved and sort of get this 'well convince me attitude'.  Aside from explaining basic functionality I think I leave them disappointed.  Except when I've had maybe two drinks then I dork out so hard.

they're all pretty savvy.  I used to want to baby them (ie check they were good to process it etc) but I just hold back and they figure it out.  There's some pretty good software that makes it pretty easy.
Definitely come to a meet up, I'm pretty active in the community.  It's a lot less terrifying that commenting on reddit.  Most australians are pretty chill and there's always beer and pizza.
PM me if you're going and we'll catch up.

link me up pizza is easily my favourite food and i go mornington way every so often.
I spend btc as it's a great opportunity to chat w/ merchants and every time is an amazing and electrifying reminder of the power of the protocol (ie I just sent you 3.50 through the worlds most powerful decentralised super computing network).
I always replenish my supplies, so no stress (spent 13 btc when they were cheaper so I've learnt my lesson).
I definitely want to increase my holdings though.  I 'save' my btc also (ie cold wallet for savings).
Just normal finances really except no one can fuck with my wealth and when I lose my keycard I can still get eggs benedict.

Compare bitcoins pegs it at buy/sell so if its at the top its cheapest.  CoinJar have a 1% promotion ATM so even with spread pretty cheap.

I have a cafe near my house called Imbis25 where I get coffee every morning, beavers tail is also in st kilda and does amazing bacon and eggs when I'm rat trash hungover.  All for bitcoin.  
There's another cafe in Melbourne CBD called little mule that takes bitcoin where get a chicken, prosciutto sandwich with beetroot and some sort cream and rocket with a ginger beer at least once a week.  
There's a pool hall near my work that takes Btc but I'm shit so I just go for the beers.  I also run a little business consultation that makes websites as part of its service and I use namecheap for domain names cause they take bitcoin.  
The other night I was drunk and registered milf.estate, sneaky.singles, myshit.tattoo and a tonne of other domains with the new tlds being released.  So sometimes the incredible ease of bitcoin transactions in the digital space can work against you.

It's a bitcoin exchange and wallet.  You can tell because on the front page it says buy and sell bitcoin, then lists the fees.  There's also a photo of the coinjar wallet.  Those are the biggest clues.

100% agree about importance of it as a functional unit of account.  I'm lucky in melbourne.  There's cafes, bars etc that take btc so i get to spend a lot.  
For every day use I have [Coinjar]( (australian exchange, good for me) linked to bank account so I spend btc, pump in more fiat for top ups to hot wallet, as well as adding to cold wallet (kind of like savings/spendings).  It's all pretty easy/kind of run of the mill actually.
It's cool paying for breakfast with bits.  I feel pretty comfy keeping a chunk of savings in btc too.  I'm only exposed to risk with my CoinJar account to the point i'm comfortable with (ie how much I would carry in a wallet).  
As trustworthy institutions emerge there will be more consumer friendly 'financial products' based around the bitcoin protocol.  Can't really expect the consumer to utilise it till it's a better option than their current one, but it seems like those technologies (that pass on the efficiencies, with less of the complexities) are coming.
Or someone will crack elliptical curve cryptography and we'll all look like chumps.

I like that even relatively new users become self deprecating pretty quick though.  We're all trainwrecks anyways we may as we'll laugh about it.  Reddit is one giant jerk factory anyway.  Great for qa testing a website/editing an article though.  If there's a mistake they'll tell ya.  Cue me being told why I shouldn't have been born.

Heh I was showing a potential new partner functionality of a POS system and didn't realise till my blockchain wallet on my phone didn't work.  I had a little fright, had to be like 'normally it works' and make up a quick work around.  Thankfully keys backed up, I was charming and the rest of the transaction was fine.  No harm no fowl. Browns law when it comes to demoing things.  Keep up the good work guys.

that was actually an example of the coinjar merchant invoice, I just got him to hold it up.  
It's pretty cool because it lets them create a link, and mail it to customer, and when it opens creates a payable invoice QR code (ala bitpay payment screen).
Basically means merchants can send invoices super easily, and peg invoice in AUD.
CoinJar app ftw though.
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:15:22
Hey man you can set up an offline/paper wallet that has never touched a third party (except in building the generative code which is usually scrutinised/open source).
Bitcoin is the first efficient store of value that requires no trust (except for the purchase window, but that risk can be managed pretty effectively).  
If you ever do want to get some and want some advice on how to manage offline without vulnerability to third parties pm me.
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:48:57
Are you aware of some other exchange options outside of USD/EURO/AUD markets where it is easy to cash out?  
I know local bitcoins is a great option, however it'd be great if there was a resource of good exchanges for different regions we could direct them to.  I guess the problem there is they probably don't have a bank to cash out to.
It'd be great to be able to paint the whole ecosystem for them in a way that they can participate without having the become bitcoin believers.  
@_date: 2014-03-01 13:22:35
imbis 25 blessington st, st kilda, beavers tail on cnr of barkly st/carlisle st st kilda - both great cafes.
Grumpys green on smith st and kodiak club on brunswick st - two awesome bars.
Roller door cafe in west melbourne.  Also earth and sky organics (organic food shop).
pollyster bookshop and eclectico also take bitcoin.
There's probably more but those are the ones that are relevant to me.
@_date: 2014-07-11 10:53:32
Good thinking.  One thing: you don't need to scan anything if you enter your id details and it all matches up.  (Only need a scan if there's an address mismatch).
@_date: 2014-05-20 10:52:42
Love it.  Good work guys.
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:36:56
I think good actors are emerging, and the free market will create a more educated, demanding consumer.  
It's tricky because after things like gox it's easy to just hand over responsibility to a governing body that already has the administrative skillsets to ensure consumer protection.   
But that leaves the network open to manipulation/control by what some would consider the original cartel.  I have to say Benjamin Lawsky, the NYC guy proposing bitlicenses is being surprisingly moderate, methodical and balanced in his approach.
Thankfully the nature of the protocol itself means only so much can be done to regulate it.  Ie you can manage the conversion points and make that very difficult, but it's pretty hard to touch transactions within the system.
If I choose to accept bitcoin as payment for goods/services, and others in the community provide my goods and services for bitcoin in turn, that kind of closed loop is basically untouchable, and probably isn't that far off.

I'd say that's more of a trading platform.  An exchange is where you exchange currency and doesn't require facilitation of traders/speculators imo .  You don't see traders outside the front of airport currency exchanges haggling.  Potato/potata really though.  Cool kids are learning about it whatever it's called.
@_date: 2013-11-17 06:05:22

@_date: 2013-12-15 04:48:11
you just need your coins in a wallet client (like blockchain.info).  My wallet client makes a qr code, they scan it with theres and hit send.   I wouldn't recommend keeping your coins on an exchange as they are vulnerable.  I would also recommend keeping the bulk of your coins offline or on a paper wallet.  If you're not 100% on what I mean you need to research storing coins just to make sure you're not exposed to risk/inconvenience.
@_date: 2013-05-08 08:35:29
if you could make an app that alerts on the cross of the short and long EMA that'd be amazing.

Half and half buddy boy.  Or fractional depending on how comfortable you are with risk.   You should always have like a grand in $$ in case of emergency.
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:39:12
basically you can upload your offline key into your wallet and it'll have all qr code functionality etc pretty intuitively.  I'd assume LTC clients are pretty similar.  no problem.
@_date: 2013-08-13 00:55:08
I just copied code and it's title from blockchain website and that was how it was labeled.  So I guess Blockchain.info and myself use it.  No one else though I promise.

reasearch - wallet, adress, and key.  check out [this]( write up about how to make a paper wallet.  It's basically a way to create an address offline.  Do some research.  Google "how to make a paper wallet".  Make sure you understand what you're doing.  Set up wallets with test balance before you transfer whole amount.  Also give me all your bitcoins plz.
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:51:55
nailed it.  The card will aid adoption and everyday use (i like spending my btc).  More merchants are exposed as a consequence.  After enough BTC/Visa card transactions they realise if they cut out visa they'll save 3%.  
One day - "Hey buddy put your btc/visa card away i'm taking BTC too now".  
QR codes start popping up.  People start keeping their hot wallets handy. Merchants (like myself) start noticing they don't need to convert BTC into fiat as sales in fiat are sufficient to pay suppliers and it's actually a pretty good store of wealth.  Hell maybe even some of their suppliers start taking BTC.  
BTC to Visa may be counter intuitive but it's an excellent stop gap.  Of course if it does it's job it'll make itself redundant then will be out of a job.  But I'm sure he/she will have come up with something new by then.
@_date: 2013-12-14 04:04:27
I hear ya man.   the cafe down the road takes btc (imbis in st kilda/melbourne if any ostrahlians here).
The first time i saw my value hit their wallet it was pretty awesome.   Being able to buy coffee/breakfast with my phone is cool cause i lose my keycard like once every two months.
we were selling mags at a btc meetup and had a payment qr and having btc hit my wallet while i was walking around was cool.  Just decentralised peer to peer transactions but it feels pretty fly.

You need income over 70k to pay GST.  As a Uni student consulting part time to pay the ol' bills I doubt I'll hit that this year.  I will need to pay income tax though.  gonna save a BTC to send to the ATO.  I'm actually not 100% sure how that will work though.
@_date: 2013-05-08 08:45:03
yeah too easy.  There's a lot of analysis tools, however [this]( is a really good breakdown of one technique 
tl;dr when the blue line crosses over the yellow line in [clark moody]( it's usually a pretty good indication that you should sell and when yellow line gets back on top its a good indication to buy.  
It's not the bible but it's a good indicator of market trends.  I for one would love to know of a potential crash a bit before it happens, not just after.
If you can choose frequency that it alerts at (h4,h1,m15 etc - read clark moody walkthrough), and maybe a potential margin of error that tells you if short ema is less than .25% higher than long (or vice versa) (this is based on [this]( trading bots strategy), you'll be my hero.
Edit: bracket adjustment and statement that I am aware that that is the longest tl;dr ever.  I'm tired from never sleeping from always watching the cross.
@_date: 2013-05-08 08:50:09

We're not fussed about making moolah (BTC or fiat).  Just thought it was cool and would get the guys interested.  Is there a better platform for doing sort of a bandcamp for btc?
