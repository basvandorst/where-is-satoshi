If you call "Giving shit away" "Adoption", then there definitely is.


Hodling makes the currency more scarce, and value is a combination of scarcity and desirability. Since we have new bitcoins being created daily, the currency is both inflationary in the sense that it's literally an increase in the supply of money, as well as inflationary as in the buying power of a particular bitcoin is made to be less. This is the same problem that reserve notes have, but with bitcoin the effect is more dramatic. Since the "amount of bitcoin existing" inflation is controlled by an algorithm, we can only stifle the effects of it by means of decreasing the actualized amount of bitcoin available on the market, ie "hodling". 
This is economics 101, simply supply vs demand stuff. 


You need to back this up with something. 
You can have transactions going like crazy in an economy and still have no wealth. The amount of transactions doesn't necessarily give you any indication whatsoever about the desiribility to take part in that economy. If you trade a rock for a stick, that stick for a sea-shell, and that seashell for a leaf, you have a healthy amount of trade taking place but no actual wealth. Value  &gt;  trade volume. 


Not true at all, there are many investors who are avoiding bitcoin because they see it as too inflationary. It is the second worst investment in 2014, and yes, that's due to the bubble at the end of last year, but staying the course and driving the price lower will not get institutional investors involved.


Again, not true, many people use it for it's potential gains, and therefore they *are* using it because of it's scarcity. The only reason it's valuable *at all* is because of scarcity. 


True, but they won't be able to if we flood the market with free bitcoins. 


This is a softer position than you started that paragraph with. The scarcity does have a factor into it's overall adoption and value, and I'm saying we shouldn't ignore that. 
Again, I'm not saying *everyone should completely stop spending, destroy the economy by making the economy cease to exist*. I'm saying "Tone it back a tad with the giving shit away", and "Understand that retailers just cash their bitcoin out when they get them". 


No, I'm not. I'm arguing that value is more important at this moment. Can't you see shades other than black and white? 


Dude, grow up. Seriously, just because you don't like what I'm saying doesn't mean you need to be a child about it. Either address the points brought up or shut up, don't just dismiss it like it doesn't matter, that's petty.


Whereas you won't actually back up your ideas with anything whatsoever.

I refuse to refer to "giving it away", which destroys any value associated, as "adoption". 


Don't worry, I believe you. :P


Here's where I disagree, tipping does not increase demand, it increases supply. Spreading is vague, but it also increases supply, not demand. 


I can see why someone would view this in such a way, but I think in the reverse. Something needs to have value before it can have mainstream adoption. Bitcoin has utility in many fields, and that utility will eventually make it's way to the mainstream, but if it does not serve as a store of value first and foremost, it's value in all the functions and utilities it does serve becomes less so. 


My wallet is *especially* luxurious. 


I'm not dealing in absolutes, I'm talking the current market. Bitcoin is being given away for free and that undermines it's value. It's value is important to the functions of bitcoin and it's utility.

@_date: 2014-12-28 20:22:36
But an inflationary currency doesn't serve as a store of value, and isn't a good choice considering that the price of bitcoin is going down faster than the value of a dollar. As such, it makes *no sense* to put money into the currency, as the dollar is outperforming it. 
An economy should not be measured by the keynesian metric of "how many transactions are occuring", it should be judged based on the wealth it represents. 
I'm not saying completely stop all bitcoin transactions, I'm saying slow it down. Holdings is more important than transaction volume, especially considering that a bitcoin can be broken into 8 decimal places.

It has end to end encryption with HTTPS. In order to mitm that, you would need to attack via DNS hijacking as well as illegitimate certificates that you would need to get signed by the blockchain. info certificate authority. Even if you get privileged access to their servers, you would need to conduct your cracking of wallets with brushoffs because the information is verified with zero knowledge proofs.
Edit: according to the blockchain.info about page, it's actually all done client side with  JavaScript, which means the information isn't sent over Internet's. I see no reason to believe that  blockchain.info is insecure.

Many classical anarchists think private property is theft, and capitalism as exploitative. Anarcho-capitalists think private property is great, and capitalism is great too. Also, I don't care the definition, ancaps generally use it to mean "violating the property rights of others in a non-defensive way". So, in other words, theft, assault, vandalism, etc.

The people in this subreddit are more likely to call you names for something that they perceive to be a bad question. The other subreddit is much more patient. 
Your question didn't really make sense to me, are you referring to miners? Either way, the only thing that gives it value, and even gives gold it's value, is it's desirability combined with it's scarcity. Since Bitcoin is seen as a medium of exchange, that gives it desirability, and combined with it's scarcity, you can figure out it's "value". The best way to determine it's value is in comparison to something else, since value is subjective. For example, nowadays people tend to use the US Dollar as a comparison, and as such the market seems to value bitcoin at about 670 per bitcoin. Some value it more highly, some value it lower, but the value as estimated by various exchanges represents a mean. 
Bitcoin is no different from anything else, scarcity+desirability=value, no matter if you're talking about bitcoin, gold, ice cream, or Dean Martin videos. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:48:24
I wouldn't say I'm desperate, I don't have anything invested I'm not prepared to lose, but I want to see bitcoin succeed. The bitcoin economy is so small at this point that the mentalities and attitudes of people in this community do affect it. As such, price is an indicator of short-term success. Short-term success is required for long-term success to exist, because if we fail in the short-term there won't be a long term.

It has end-to-end encryption over https, and has a pretty good paper wallet generator. Also, it uses 2 factor  authentication. It isn't an exchange, where coins are held off the blockchain, I don't see why people think it is insecure. Their servers are more secure than my desktop, and more secure than my phone. I think a lot of people think it is insecure because it is web based, but it isn't like they're storing your coins like a bank, it's just a web interface for any wallet.

This may be mostly correct, and I'm not going to nitpick, except to point out that bitcoin is currently more inflationary than the dollar is, and as such when you have a choice between the two currencies, both of which accomplish the same task, you are going to go with the one that is more inflationary. This isn't to disregard the power of consumer spending in adoption, but I see far too much adoption right now, and not enough "value storing" that drives price stability. 


As I said, don't judge an economy based on movement, judge it base on it's relative wealth. 


Value isn't just derived of price, it is also based on desirability. Scarcity + Desiribility = value. Bitcoin requires desiribility, such as consumer incentives to actually adopt the currency, but right now it's severely lacking in the scarcity department. 


You will need to justify that statement. As I said previously, more transactions =/= stronger economy. 


Right, because the value is going down but the transaction volume is going up. That makes perfect sense, especially since we like good news here on &gt;...This has absolutely nothing to do with the argument. Spending is good and holding isn't so good no matter how divisible bitcoin is.
Yes it does, the purchasing power of a bitcoin is very relevent to this discussion. The retailers will also be happy to accept less bitcoin for the same amount of cash, the price of bitcoin is irrelevent if they're instantly cashing it out for reserve notes. However, the value of a bitcoin, and the purchasing power of a bitcoin are *extremely* important to anyone who has an interest in this currency.

It can be broken down into 8 decimal places. As of right now, the smallest unit a bitcoin can be broken into is worth 0.000006663 dollars. By giving it away for free, in essence you remove it's scarcity in the same way that it did in the Dogecoin community.

Yes, it is completed. I'll try what you've said in here, we'll see what happens.

they're willing to *regulate*. Incredibly receptive? They haven't a goddamned clue what they're talking about and they're talking about regulation.

xfce isn't bare bones. It's much more feature-rich than Gnome 3, or even Gnome 2. Also, unlike KDE it's GTK based. I mean, I can't deny that KDE probably has it beat on features, but it's qt based and most programs I like are gtk based, so that's that.

What law? It's just a gang telling you what to do. Do what you want, just don't hurt anyone.

The Nature vs Nurture debate rages on, but I'm stuck in the Nature side. I'd say about 20 percent "nurture" and about 80 percent "nature" would be about right when it comes to that sort of thing. 
The concept that women are incapable of voicing their interests due to social pressure, when it's obvious that they are usually more likely to be immune from judgement in situations where they go outside of the status quo, is really demeaning to women. If they *wanted* to do something, they'd do it, they're not so weak as to be offed by mild peer-pressure. They're stronger than that.

Right now it's re-scanning and takin' a helluva long time to do it. 
EDIT: uploading to that server didn't work either, unexpected end-of-file. Maybe my network is screwy.

Debian with XFCE is much lighter than Windows XP

I'd party with them.

It's still a different toolkit than most linux programs use for rendering, therefore it doesn't match. 
Conformity is lovely.

Greed is good. Bitcoin made you a better person.

I've never been more skeptical of anything I've ever seen on the internet.
