I work in Programmatic advertising in NYC. It's real-time buying. Very very similar to how the stock market is traded but for ads. A lot of us come from the finance industry so I have a lot of connections/ crossover friends to hedge funds etc. They are buying a lot. They are also super excited about the futures. Further, a lot of "normies" are buying in as well. Even my mother in butt fuck Canada who can barely use her iPhone was asking me about it yesterday. It's hit some social critical mass.

Yeah. If you do it right you should have 100% of your money back in a year actually. My friend who is an owner in several had his latest bar make his entire investment back in 6 months. He only had 50K in that place and the bar is absolutely killing it so that is an extreme example. If you know what you are doing bar ownership here is extremely profitable. It's booze which people in NYC consume WAY more than the average American (no one has to drive) and foot traffic.

You open the bar with a few investors. What a lot of people do here is they work as a bar tender forever and eventually manage a bar for some owners. Sometimes those owners open a new spot and they want the manager to run the.m new place and hire staff. Sometimes they will let you take an ownership stake instead of getting paid. That guys starts stacking cash and then will try and open his own place with a few investors maybe from the group of owners he knows or some other industry type people he knows or friends. In my case I’m friends with people who have worked in bars there whole lives. Like most small business they prefer to work with people they know. Anyway I’m not saying it’s risk free but if I made like 200k on bitcoin I would cash some out and open a new place as a diversification investment. I’m long on bars because they do well even when markets tank and a local bar isn’t something you can automate out of existence. Shits gonna get worse for the middle class and they are still going to drink.

Agreed, Assuming it's just his risky investment money. 120K is something you can invest in something less volatile but also very profitable. An example 100K stake in a decent bar here in NYC is worth like 6000 a month in payouts.

Most bars and restaurants fail because the people opening them 1.) underestimate expenses 2.) underestimate the cost of not greasing a palm so they end up unable to open their doors for 4 months waiting on corrupt bullshit paperwork to "go through" while paying rent 3.) run out of money as investors because they didn't get enough initial capital/ took business loans they need to make payments on. 4.) don't know what they "are" and try and sell fancy shit that is complex and hard to manage logistically. and on and on. If you know what you are doing your place can and will be successful. The  reason most bars fail and restaurants is running out of money in the first 2 years. You make it past 2 years failure rates are negligible. It's not for everyone but when done right is a very profitable business.

Easily, Again I said good bar and with people who know what they are doing. As a basic rule of Thumb to open a spot in Brooklyn will be about 300-500K depends on location and work needing to be done. Often involving a total of 4 investors. In a month a bar can make 30-60K in sales. Again a general rule of thumb is upkeep like rent etc will cost around 20K the rest goes to the investors. The move here is to usually have a stake in several bars. I highly doubt these numbers are possible outside of NYC or like LA but a bar investment with the right people is awesome.

yeah, in NYC. If you put 100K into a bar and weren't making like 50K at least you are doing something really wrong. 100K is like nice average cost for 1/4 stake in a good bar in Brooklyn. A big hot spot in the city you would be making a lot more and would probably need to buy in at like 250K.

That's basically profit for the month. Not taking out rent and overhead for repair etc. Which I stated is around 20K usually. You don't really have to pay staff much here because of tip culture.

Bitcoins value is still tied to "what someone is willing to pay for it" very strongly hence the massive valuation changes. Which means it's value is still defined by outside currency for now.....and it's usage requires investors confidence. A "tool" used to buy heroine doesn't inspire that. The US Dollar is already established as a reliable currency so the fact people use it to buy drugs is a non issue because people will use anything to buy drugs weather it is new or old. New things have to inspire confidence of the masses he is skeptical because....politics.
