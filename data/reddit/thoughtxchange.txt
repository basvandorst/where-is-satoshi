It dropped these idiots about 5 years ago and moved to Capital One- have not looked back. I was out of a job for a period and they charged me 12 a month because I didn’t have direct deposit. - needed to have 2 direct deposits per month to keep it fee free. So a little bit of a sucker punch to someone that was out of a job. I was focused on finding a job and not changing my account, but shortly after I secured a position I went into the branch to close out my account and explain why and who I was moving to. Just a completely better experience with Capital One- they at least act like they care and that they are thinking of their customers. I’ve expanded my business with them while I have shut all Bank of America accounts. It’s kind of amazing that Bank of America just doesn’t seem to care at all.

Apple's core values. When they make statements about "think different" and being the rebels and the crazy ones who are out to change the world and then suppress attempts by others to innovate and change the world you have to question them. Bitcoin has the ability to literally change the world in a way similar to the way the internet changed the world. By giving people a cheap and easy way to exchange stored value. Their attempt to suppress this movement that is already well under way because they want to be in a position to capitalize off their own system just reeks of hypocrisy.  
 My aunt owns some bitcoin
 I can and will push my view as I see fit. "Without letting her make a fully formed decision"? Lol. She is a very intelligent person and will take the information I give plus her own research to make a decision. She is the one making the trade. Your determination this is "ethically suspect" is mind boggling and I got a good laugh- so thanks for that.
You must work for/ are to tied to Apple in some way financially. I'd bet on that.

I have to say that I find it very difficult to believe that a man intelligent enough to invent Bitcoin and smart enough to try to mask his identity in many ways, would not be smart enough to secure himself somewhere just in case. Someone that smart has to know that you will be found eventually. They eventually found Osama Bin Laden. If he was paranoid enough to mask his e-mails, etc I would think it would follow that he would be paranoid enough to assume someone was going to find him and that he would need to secure himself physically (ie. not be in a random CA neighborhood with your Corrola parked in the driveway). Or maybe he is just that eccentric? All I know is the man the reporter called out is in immediate physical danger and I hope he has already gotten the hell out of there.

I think most people charge 1% to convert to cash. It looks like coinbase does everything for 1% (ie. handels the transaction processing and then converts bitcoin to cash).
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:55:01
The writing on the wall for me was in the last press release where they did not give a specific date for an update. I don't have any money in Gox but I kinda wanted to choke someone in their management team when they said they would keep everyone "in the loop". No legit business says something like that in a press release. I read that as- "we are preparing to close up shop and when we get around to it we will drop the solvency bomb on you- thanks!" 
I could never get past: 
 their stupid ass unprofessional name (Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange?? Really?) 
 they are based in Japan and my money needs to go to Japan. No. Just no.
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:02:55
I hope I am wrong about this but I can see them making a statement to the effect that after reviewing their books carefully they have found that the transaction malleability "issue" affected their books and now they are not solvent. "It wasn't us, it was the bitcoin protocol!" The lack of a committed date to give an update is obvoisly concerning. I wish they'd just come out and say the news, whatever it is and just get it done instead of dragging everyone down with them.

The level of shadiness at Mt. Gox is mind boggling. You are moving addresses right in the middle of all this BS going on? No. These guys have some balls for sure. Will be interesting to see what new excuse the have for everyone tomorrow. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:10:05
I hate to say it but this was the only reason I did not invest with Gox. It would be almost impossible to get any money back if something like what is happening happened. At least with a US based company I have a better chance of getting something back. And they know that there will be many more than a handful of protesters at their door if something like what Gox has done ever went down.

When their competition is able to lower prices more because they are less greedy the greedier company will lose sales. Hopefully the economics of the situation will work out for the consumer. But I'm sure this will help the CEO's in some way/ shape/ form.

It was out Tuesday evening. 
I tried setting up on  but have problems with getting anything to work. Not sure if it's Windows 8.1 or what. Have gotten some coins through a faucet website (listed in the Twitter stream) and am currently solo mining (666,666 coins is the reward for solving the block lol).
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:33:18
The level of shadiness going on at Mt. Gox right now is kind of amazing. 1 BTC was down to $220 today. I'm just a big believer in you don't get something for nothing. I can understand a little bit of a spread between exchanges- but we are talking an almost $400 spread here right now. You would be able to almost triple your money right now if you could buy some at Mt Gox and sell on Coinbase. I am very skeptical that could be done. I think people who are trying to take here are going to get taken.
@_date: 2014-02-17 01:28:32
Obviously not all companies outside the US are a scam, but I was always hesitant to do Bitcoin business with a company outside the US in case they tried to pull some BS like this. There is some serious shadiness going on at Mt Gox and I truly hope they get put out of business. No one deserves to lose their money because a company won't play fair.

My aunt asked me yesterday if she should invest in Apple and I had to tell her no. There are other better investments out there and if Apple is going to take actions that conflict with their core values- I can't in good conscious recommend them. I really think Apple has tarnished it's image here. If they don't correct the issue I know I will be moving to android. I've had every iPhone since the 3GS and have been happy with it. But this action against Bitcoin is a complete dealbreaker for me.

Something is definitely up with their exchange rate. I decided not to touch trying to do an arbitrage trade and I'm glad I didn't. I hope for the sake of all those who have money in Mt. Gox that they will eventually be able to withdraw.
@_date: 2014-05-25 02:33:38
That is kind of shocking. I would be very uncomfortable with that. If they asked me what I was planning on buying I'd probably tell them that with all due respect that is none of their business. It is rude to ask that type of question as it is none of their concern to get into my personal business. I would think they risk losing business by asking those types of questions- no matter how pleasant they ask the question.

@_date: 2014-01-10 22:28:43
Yep- I guess I was just including the extra $0.20 type fee in my % calculation. The actual percentage charged varies like you were saying based on transaction amount. But I have to believe that it is somewhere around 3% on average.  If you take out that 1% Coinbase fee you are going to get a good deal no matter how you slice it. Even if it's just 1%. That $1 fee on $100 adds up after awhile. I have put hundreds of thousands of dollars on my card over my life. I'm quite sure I have had well over $10,000+ in credit card transaction fees paid on my behalf by the companies I shop at over my life. I am quite sure most of that was passed on to me through price adjustments. 
There's a reason why people like Discover are able to offer cash rewards. People don't realize how much they are paying to the credit card companies because of the higher prices the stores charge to cover those costs. It's very much my hope that bitcoin takes down the card companies and the 3% charges. We need less middlemen taking a cut of our hard earned dollars. I mean other than chargeback protection and purchase protection (which I have literally never used)- what else do they offer us? I'd be happy to accept a situation where I get scammed one time for $100 under an irreversible bitcoin transaction if stores would lower their prices 3% because I'm not using a credit card any longer.
@_date: 2014-01-10 18:17:10
They just saved about $4,000 in credit card processing fees. Even if they have to pay 1% to convert to cash that's still $3000 in savings. That kind of savings could eventually be used to make stuff cheaper for everyone. This is definitely a win for bitcoin today.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:45:35
Exactly. They are pulling the rest of bitcoin down. I hope they just release something saying everyone is screwed over and allow people to move on. I've never seen anything like these idiots. They truly amaze me.
@_date: 2014-02-03 03:17:35
I am not understanding the benefit here for someone owning XCP. Can someone explain?

The relevant part to some people is that he has about half a billion dollars in Bitcoin. Should not be relevant, but apparently it is.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:49:29
This is why I have never had any coins at the exchange for any length of time. They immediately go to a paper wallet. I have 2FA and still don't trust the exchanges to not get hacked. That is one of the tradeoffs of Bitcoin- you have to protect your shit because no one else is going to do it. And no one is going to reimburse you when something bad happens.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:52:38
So basically what I'm hearing here is that Gox will not release bitcoins or dollars to their customers until someone comes up with a fix to the issue they mentioned? And there is no timeframe for this to happen. And of course it looks like they are still accepting money and changing that into bitcoin. Am I missing anything? What a cluster. These guys are going to do damage to crypto in general here with this BS. Because they don't have their stuff together, everyone is going to suffer it seems like.
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:28:46
These guys deserve a lawsuit at this point quite honestly. Yet another delay on opening up for normal business. And not any type of timeframe on when the next update will be.Mt Gox: we will be sure to "keep you in the loop" on the status of the lawsuit.
@_date: 2014-01-10 22:01:52
The exact amount at 3% is $3720 on 124K. Some cards charge slightly more. At 3.25% we sit at $4030. I don't know of any credit card processor that charges 1%- do you?
If they get charged 1% BTC-&gt; US dollar fee after the 1M Coinbase promotion they still save 2% (or more). That's a good deal. And they can pass some of that on to customers and make it harder for their competition (ie. force them to also accept Bitcoin to level the playing field).
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:12:54
This happened to me except it was a gift card that the person bought from me instead of bitcoin. The bidder paid over the value of the card which should have been a red flag. The persons account and credit card did not have names that matched- that should have been a red flag. I got the hold notice the day after I got the funds. If you ever sell a gift card never send the code out- always mail the card with a tracking number.
From there it was a nightmare of calls to Paypal. They sent me back the $50 I lost- they did not have to since their terms say that you must have a tracking number. I did the code exchange through Ebay mail so that is the only reason they were nice and did the refund (ie they could see that I was not the one running the scam). The kicker is that the transaction was reveresed AGAIN with Paypal saying the credit card company filed a claim. After arguing I finally got ANOTHER credit which ended the whole thing. I would still like to know where all those credits went to. Something did not add up and I told Paypal- I guess it's on them to figure that out since they were they ones to issue the seller protection credits to me.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:01:32
Dumb. It's like $840 per coin (25% more expensive than Coinbase). I'll order through coinbase out of my bank account for that upcharge.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:45:31
So glad to read this. Awesome. I was wondering about the verification time. I was thinking what others were saying. At a store you have a low value transaction and the store just takes on the risk knowing that most likely someone is not going to put in the amount of effort to double spend. I see bitcoin as being able to revolutionize this world on a scale like the internet has. I hope 2014 will be another breakthrough year for bitcoin!

If they need a dev team to accept bitcoin they are in trouble. Their website says Coinbase is the one handling the transactions. It's a small addition of code to their website. They could have an arrangement with coinbase to just autotranslate BTC everyday to dollars and send to their account.

I've learned in this life that you don't get something for nothing. Which is why I did not try to put my bitcoins in MtGox not too long ago when they were trading well above the average of the other exchanges. Something felt off. I would have been going ape if I would have knowing I could not withdraw the coins or my money now. I just have a feeling these guys are going down. They are not being honest about what has really happened and are buying themselves just a little time. This is now day 4 since they made their announcement of the issue. I just can't believe that they would not have been ale to implement a fix that I understand has already been worked out. Or communicate about what they are doing again. I do hope for the sakes of all the people who have money in there that they reopen soon- nobody deserves to lose all their money like this.

I am skeptical this is him. It would be a very ballsy move to be using your own name and be living in a house in some CA neighborhood with your Corrolla in the driveway.

I don't have any coins in Mt. Gox. I basically decided that I wanted to do business with a US based company in case there were any BS issues like the ones we are seeing with Mt Gox. I may not get my funds back if Coinbase went down but at least it would be easier dealing with a US company during the legal process.
That being said- this looks really bad on Mt. Gox. Obviously. You don't get the weekend off to rest when you are basically telling your customers they can't withdraw funds. I do not believe that they need DAYS to figure this out. It should not be that complicated. They are stalling. The first indicator that something was up was the much higher exchange rate for them 1-2 weeks ago. Red flag. Didn't know exactly what was up but I do know you don't get something for nothing. Makes me wonder if they were trying to pull people in to increase liquidity. I have to wonder if someone stole some of their coins somehow and now they are struggling for solvency. I hate to say it but that looks like one of the most likely scenarios. I just have a bad feeling about this for next week. If they do go under I think it will be a buying opportunity because there is a good chance we will see prices drop into the 500's.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:04:19
I held it for a long time- I bought it around 1K so I made some money. It just kept going down, down down- in my mind I was focused on having little to no debt from the car purchase. It was hard to sell after holding it for so long through the ups and downs. I could have held more debt on the car and financed more- in hindsight that is obviously what I should have done. Just a really sucky situation. Hopefully something unpredictably good will come my way after this unpredictably bad thing. I will be buying back in- just trying to get stable footing again and will try to slowly build back up. Hopefully I will get lucky in tracking down the guy that hit me- I have lots of information including a dash cam video- just no plate number due to his speed. Hope he has some good insurance if I do find him.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:04:30

@_date: 2019-02-08 20:19:53
The pop was 100% completely my fault. :) I had to sell a good deal of my crypto yesterday (after having it for \~2 years) to help finance a little bit of an emergency situation not of my making. And of course- as per usual procedure- it pops up hard directly after. And knowing my luck it will pop to the moon here shortly. Gotta love it!

I sold my bitcoin at $3500- near the rock bottom for this year -to help pay for a replacement car after a hit and run in late January. I mean it took off the second I sold towards the end of Feb. It has been difficult to watch this especially given the few years I was invested in. I did make a profit but obviously would have been up 100%'s of % if I would have not sold. I'm still in the process of tracking the fucker down- there will be a lawsuit. Unbelievable bad luck followed by more unbelievable bad luck. My logic in selling was it was continuing to move down and I wanted to pay down the replacement car- that was obviously very wrong. I'm up to about a 25K loss on what I would have had. I guess life's a bitch sometimes.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:04:38
Yup- trying to. :(
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:07:55
Yeah- I should posts my trades in and out. Just do the opposite of what I do and you will be set for life. I'm thinking of buying about $1000.00 to start to get back in. So may be time for all to sell! Unbelievable this is up $2000.00 in one day. Makes me even more sick today.
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:09:25
Kind of sad but I sold everything I have across cryptos yesterday- and I had been holding some of mine for well over a year. I think the next month is going to be the opposite of what this coming month was last year :(
@_date: 2019-05-28 15:56:59
I would not have cashed in the 25K- I held it all the way through the painful downturn (of course all the way to the bottom!) and would have continued to hold it long term as was always my plan. At this point it's just starting over and investing small amounts to build up my holding. Currently it's at zero but I'm hoping to be able to restart purchasing a little at a time and as I can afford here shortly.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:47:19
That doesn't make any sense at all in context of what I wrote. Did you actually read what I wrote? The "loss" came from having to liquidate the bitcoin due to someone else's negligence. There was no actual loss because I had held the BTC for about 2 years. It has been an opportunity loss. I would have never sold had it not been for the accident.
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:54:14
I've just figured out that I've lost $25,000 due to my decision to sell 4.6 BTC at the very low at the beginning of February. This was to help replace my car after a hit and run accident I was in. My logic was it was continuing to move down- and well I really needed to get a replacement car). I had a little breakdown after seeing the price rise yet again today. I could not have been more unlucky- it started moving up directly after I sold and hasn't stopped.. It did prompt me to write another letter tonight to the section of the police  that are "helping" me track the person down (I have front/ rear dash cam footage of the entire thing- minus the plate number due to the speed). Can't wait to track the fucker down and sue him for damages,

This chart says it all I think:
You can make some money from processing transactions- I guess I haven't really looked into how much that might be. I would imagine that it is not significant. Have not done the profit and loss analysis to see if it is even worth it.
I looked at mining months ago when the price spiked to around $240. The difficulty rate was at a fraction of where it is now. I did the math on how much you could make at that price if you had the 500GH/s BFL ASIC miner and it was like $500,000/ month. The only problem was it that you knew that difficulty was going up (I didn't expect it to go up quite so quick)- and of course no one could get their hands on one of these at the time. Also- the $240 price was not sustainable at the time. Fast forward to now and thank goodness that I trusted my gut about the difficulty and likelihood that BFL would be able to get out product to me in a timeframe that was reasonable given their continued delays. If you look at the difficulty chart now I just don't see how you could have any hope of making money- seems like it is climbing exponentially right now as so many ASIC's are coming online. 
I don't see how the increase in difficulty is really sustainable at the current rate given it seems like it is not economically feasible to mine due to the cost of equipment and electricity. The bottom line is there are only so many bitcoins that will be given out in a given period. The price of a bitcoin isn't really going up too much. So those few bitcoins given out are being spread among a lot of new people with ASIC's in their hands and everyone is getting less of the pot. It's more expensive to mine due to higher electricity costs per coin you get due to higher difficulty. Seems like a lotta people just got messed over with an ASIC that really is for all intents and purposes worthless. My feeling is that the gold rush is over. Definitely interested in what others think. I so wish I would have had the intelligence to be looking at this in 2009 lol. I'd love to hear some stories of how and why the early adopters got involved. Love to hear stories of how people get in on things early. Seems like it's a lot of hard work, constant scanning of opportunities, some luck and some patience!
@_date: 2013-10-06 22:30:30
So glad I did not try to get into the Bitcoin mining game. Was looking at an ASIC miner back when it was 7MM ish. I'd have been crushed just like I thought (mainly because BFL did exactly what I thought they'd do to their customers which is fuck them completely over). I honestly don't get how this hasn't pulled back. How is mining profitable right now? Or are people just doing it for fun and speculation of a future increase in the value of Bitcoin? Seems like people are playing a potentially expensive game here. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:57:04
I'm actually a little speechless on exactly how dumb that article actually was. I wasn't expecting it to create a new level of dumb- but it did!
@_date: 2013-09-16 06:45:10
I think people will be forced out when they see that mining is not economically feasible (ie. electricity costs per month will be higher than what you could get for your monthly bitcoin win). Of course those same people might come back on-line as difficulty pulls back- which I feel it will here shortly- unless people will just continue mining for the thrill which could happen (or their speculation that the exchange rate will be more favorable in the future). 
At some point I would think that all the components (difficulty, electricity costs, ASIC cost, exchange rate) would align in such a way that there is a razor thin profit margin and that will propel hashing until there are no bitcoins left to be mined. That razor thin margin will be the reward for someone taking the risk of putting capital into an ASIC and electricity and for accepting risk around difficulty changes and exchange rate.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:50:42
It is hard to think of it that way. It was my decision to sell so I own that. It is just very hard to take that I would have had 25K in extra funds available to me in just over 3 months after this accident had it not happened. Obviously sh*t happens in this life- this has been a prime example in my life of that being a true statement.

I have this installed on my iphone and I have BTC sitting in my wallet. I have recently sent BTC from my iphone to another wallet so I don't get why it is being said that the Blockchain app can't function as a wallet. I installed it maybe 3 weeks ago- so maybe something has changed since then and I got an earlier version. Apple is pissing me off though that it is not letting apps like Coinbase function. They may end up losing customers over this if they don't get it together. This kind of stuff is why I have always been a little bit ambivilent in moving to Apple. They have a history of doing this kind of stuff. I'm mean if we are honest about it, it's one of the reasons why Microsoft continues to be the dominant player in the OS space- they don't try to control and restrict everything.
@_date: 2013-10-27 19:23:39
Not if I could buy 5 bitcoins for the same price- the amount of bitcoins I'd ever hope to get from mining on that machine given the ever increasing difficulty. Would not have to wait months to have them in my pocket and would not have to pay even more for the electricity needed to mine. I guess I have not exactly done the math here but it just seems that buying coins outright at this point makes the most sense given all the other factors involved with mining. Granted it probably feels cool to mine your own coins- but looking at this from a purely ROI perspective I have to believe directly investing in the coins at this point is the best way to go.
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:48:01
I don't understand why difficulty is continuing to increase given the economics of the situation. I guess some people are mining because they feel the price will eventually go up substantially? Just don't understand from a purely rational perspective. Or maybe people just are not acting rationally. Seems like it would just be better to buy some bitcoins and wait for the price to go up if that is what you believe. Rather than spending money on a unit, power and then be subject to mind boggling increases in difficulty that are happening regularly. Just don't get it. I made the decision not to buy a miner many months ago because of what I thought would happen (which happened and then some).
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:48:38
This is why Bitcoin is going to be huge. The general public is going to eventually see the benefit of not having to deal with people like Paypal- paying out your $3+ for every $100 you purchase. I never really realized how much money I give to the credit card companies through transaction fees (that I may not always pay directly, but you can know that the stores pass back to their customers through price adjustments) until Bitcoin came along and I started digging into the current structure
@_date: 2013-10-07 21:30:55
Oh haha. I was googling RDF and was like WTF? Ha.
Yeah- I've just been around the bitcoin world for about 6 months. Did not do much research on FPGA. I must just be a BFL thing. Maybe they think because the older design can be in your hands sooner it's more valuable. I don't really get BFL though. Don't seem like an overly professional company.

For those wanting to buy adult movies I can imagine bitcoin will be a hit (don't think I want to go there with this site though). No more having a crazy name show up on a credit card statement lol. I think bitcoin plus adult products in general will be a hit.

Could you expand? Not sure what you mean by RDF. Not familiar with this acronym in the context of Bitcoin.

I would not buy anything from BFL right now but have a hopefully stupid question:
They are selling a 600 GH/s card for $4,680:
They are selling a  less powerful 500 GH/s rig for $22,484:
I understand that the card uses the 28nm technology and it's a preorder versus the rig that uses older technology but will ship sooner. But WTF? What am I missing?
