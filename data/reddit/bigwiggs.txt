Sounds like it was 100% your mistake, Coinbase has no reason to refund you. Sorry man, that's just the way it is. You are in control of your funds, therefore when you send it to the wrong address, it is all on you.

Regulation is inevitable, as those in power will not relinquish it so easily. Taxes are a big issue that needs to be hammered out. The question is, how far will they reach and whether or not it will push bitcoin out of those countries. There will always be ways around it, but it could possibly be quite disruptive. My hope is that we can get a minimal amount of regulation that actually further legitimizes bitcoin in the general public's eyes, increasing visibility and usability. Thanks :)

If you have xapo, it really is instant. I believe they also give you a bonus too. I have a wallet with xapo that I use for all my faucets, and then just send to my other wallets once I get about 1000 bits.

An Asian man walks into a Currency Exchange with 2000 yen. He receives $72.00 in U.S. Dollars. The following week, the same Asian man walks into the same currency exchange. He again exchanges 2000 yen. This time, he receives $66.00 in American currency. The Asian man doesn't understand why he received less money, so he asks the clerk, "Why less money when same 2000 yen" 
The clerk replies, "Fluctuations." As the Asian man prepares to leave, he turns, looks at the clerk and angrily says, "No, Fluck you Amelicans!"

I mean i guess I was looking for some sort of basic list/calendar sort of deal to keep track of the important and public stuff. There is a rediculous amount of stuff going on and it's always nice to have a way to organize it.

I'm not from there, but i love to visit, and it would be great to just be able to use bitcoin, and not have to go through all those currency exchanges! This is a very good thing for tourism.

I have had zero problems so far with Coinbase, and it seems to me that these issues arent really happening to "so many people." However, it is substantial and something they really do need to figure out. I can see it being extremely frustrating, and creating a bad reputation for the company. They do seem to be very quick with fixing the problem once you actually do get a hold of support, so I hope they can soon tweak their automated system to be much better at verifying people correctly.
Its a work in progress, its still a million times easier than when sending a money order to some sketchy guy you found on the internet was the only wait to obtain bitcoin.
