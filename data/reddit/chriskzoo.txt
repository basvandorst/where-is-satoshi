As Bitcoin continues to be adopted, it diminishes the power of the whales to cause fluctuations on the exchanges - their power is limited by the cash flow of the exchanges.  Coinbase does not have hundreds of millions of dollars to "cash out" a whale (hence why they have daily limits like a casino table), and as adoption to use BTC to do things like buy real estate are adopted, it eliminates their need for whales to only exit through the exchanges.  Once they no longer have to exit through the exchange, we won't see $1,000 swings in 5 minutes.
Within 2 years I bet you will see a company like Quicken Loans accept bitcoin for real estate transactions.

It is dead money, but nobody knows it's dead.  Bitcoin provides an interesting future because the ledger is completely public and that allows for analysis that can provide upward pressure.  For instance, there is no ledger for gold, so the price based largely on speculation of it's movement in the futures markets.  For instance, if money printing is going on, the price goes up due to the devaluation of fiat currencies.
With Bitcoin, analysts can accurately determine what amount of BTC is simply lost (estimated 4M coins) and you can then apply simple "time since last transaction" logic to determine the number of coins that are being HODL and really not available in the market.  As that supply shrinks, it will create upward pressure and eventually we'll reach a stabilized market.

I don't see why you would do anything else.  There is a bit of trepidation moving to something like a Ledger (it's Chrome based, will it always work, will  the backup phrase really restore my wallet?), or cold storage (will I lose this piece of paper?) but the idea of putting something like BTC with a completely unregulated website that can just "Hey, we were hacked, sorry your wallet got drained" is wreckless.

This is the problem with all exchanges, including Coinbase, which has a history of not allowing sales when the price is going up.  They don't deal in any other asset that is going down in price (like a Fidelity would with stocks), so they can't have the money. They have some protections with the daily limits (similar to table limits in a casino), which helps, but since the price has only gone up, that actually has hurt them.
The only way to overcome this is for BTC to become a widespread form of payment, at which point something like Coinbase will be pointless.

Take this as someone who was peripherally aware of Bitcoin for may years, but really just got in early in 2017. 
 Bitcoin has mindshare of names that cannot be overtaken at this point, other than some kind of catastrophic hack that completely devalues it. I also don't see it as viable long-term currency for small daily transactions, but I could certainly see it be accepted as payment for larger purchases on the magnitude of cars, houses, as well as institutional financial transactions.  An other currency that would takeover as the viable daily purchase crypto will probably have a value that's pegged to Bitcoin in some way, even if it's just psychological.

Bravo - You have the same mindset I do.  I love the enthusiasm behind and potential of bitcoin, but I think that if people aren't accepting that (for now) we live in a fiat world, they are simply deluding themselves.  
It's great that there are business popping up all over that will accept bitcoin, but as of now my mortgage company won't.  If your goal is to pay off a mortgage (no less noble than buying a lambo) the only option to do that currently is converting to dollars.

It increases the value of circulating coins - just like quantitative easing (printing billions of dollars) devalues the current supply of fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:13:10
Once you have that much bitcoin, (HODLers please ignore) what is the exit strategy back to fiat, which I assume is what most who've "gotten" rich need to do, since you can't purchase a lot with bitcoin at the moment.
Are there exchanges that will let you sell more than $10,000 a day?  Even at that rate, you're talking 190 days to divest $1.9M in bitcoin back into dollars, which seems a bit risky if you want to "retire now."

The wealthy hedging their bets.  One of the reasons I even bought 1 bitcoin at the beginning of the year was due to reading that because of the limited nature of bitcoin, even with 21M (ignoring all lost/will never circulate bitcoins) there will not be enough for every current millionaire in the US to have 1 bitcoin.
You then expand that to the world (approx 47 millionaires) and the utility of opening "banking" to literally billions of people who do not bank and, well, you do the math.
Do I think it will get to $1,000,000/BTC?  Nah, but if you asked people at the beginning of this year if it would hit $9,000 this year, you probably couldn't find a handful that weren't certifiably insane.

@_date: 2017-11-13 13:24:51
I don't think there's a right answer, but trying to put some logic behind it.  Maybe I'm no explaining my self correctly.  Let's take all transactions per day and sort them highest to lowest on a per second basis.  If every second, on average, there are 12 transactions for $1M or higher, that is the upper bound.  If the 12th transaction, on average, is $10,000, that is the upper bound...
What I'm getting at is is BTC is not financial vehicle for every transaction simply because of the 12 transactions/minute limit - it makes no sense to use as a way to buy a candy bar.  But if we limit it to only those transactions that take place 12 times/second, on average, what is that dollar amount?

I'll take the opposite viewpoint - the higher the price goes, the more it's viewed as a store of wealth for the rich and that will lower transactions - it's doesn't mean that the price is related to the number of transaction, necessarily.

I'm not sure how to take this - I was listening to a financial podcast discussing this and they suggested that opening up BTC futures could only make it go down due to the liquidity issues - the basic premise was that you can't get "out" of BTC fast enough related to the volatility, so the trend could be everyone shorting it, resulting in a bit of a crash, because shorting is a way for them to quickly make dollars.

It comes down to your duty to accurately report income.
However, much like off-shore havens (see: The Panama Papers), it would be hard for them to prove what your actual gains are.  Unless you solely buy and cash-out on a single exchange, they really have no idea.  If you open an account on Coinbase and deposit BTC to cash-out, they don't know what your original position was on that to calculate the capital gains because they don't know where that BTC ultimately came from.

I think in the ideal situation we have to control our "vault" of data.  Example: All my Facebook posts (if I was on there) are stored locally and FB has to be given a key to access that data.  When a friend accesses my posts, FB would have to use the key I gave them to access the data on my server.
Knowing the lack of technical expertise of the public, we'd need a solution where by FB would only have encrypted versions of my data and would have to validate their key on a monthly basis, or whatever.  If their key is not renewed (e.g. I want to delete my account), any data they have would self-destruct.
I think to even get there, though, we'd need some pretty explicit laws about privacy and sovereignty over your own data.

So I guess I see this as an off chain solution, similar to Lightning network?  Thinking this is how it would work if I wanted to open an account on a social network (SN):
-I open a channel off chain and fund it - this provides a connection with the SN and allows the SN to access/display my content
-As long as I keep the channel open, my content is available to the SN.
-If I close the channel, my content can then no longer be accessed (e.g. it's encrypted) 
This would solve fundamental privacy concerns.

-When you close the channel, access to your data by FB goes away, securing your privacy
