Thanks for being patient.   I've always tried to err on the side of minimal compression.

Thank you!  I really appreciate your support!
Please let me know if you have any trouble with the sign-up process.   I will be monitoring every very closely for the rest of today.

Unfortunately Coinbase only allows you to convert it all or leave it as is.   I would have liked to be able to leave some at BTC though so see if it might grow.

Thank you!!    No, these comments don't make me feel old at all.

Thanks.   Yes there was a bug which kept my system from writing your code to the DB.   I have that fixed and working now.   Let me know if your account didn't get activated properly!

I added Bitcoin to [my site]( a few weeks ago and the results have been very disappointing.   After a few signups on the first day I haven't really seen any extra sales.   People are still using the traditional methods so I'm not sure what I am doing wrong.

I do use coinbase commerce and I will definitely streamline the process if there’s interest!
