Are your warcraft gold tradeable on any exchanges? Are there any warcraft gold pairing to any cryptocurrency? If there aren"t then its not taxable.

I believed crypto mining would survive and bitcoin as well.

So what does it really means? Are the 10% increase in difficulty has something to do with the bitcoin market price or it's just another pain for the crypto miners?

Thanks for the crystal clear explanation about the difficulty. Much clearer now.  :)

Don't worry guys, Proof of keys has nothing to do with your withdrawal. You just relax and try your withdrawal again tomorrow.

OMG aren't you really aware of that? It's just like keeping your food outside your garrage.

Hodling is not a compulsory it's just a personal will to do it or not regardless of what outsiders are saying.

what do you think guys, are they gonna closed their bank accounts to buy bitcoins?

Relax they can't steal your personal Identity and your e-wallets were also safe because the info's on your ID are not enough for them to do such things. As long as you did nothing wrong there's nohing to be afraid of.

Oh ok, so the more people started mining, the lesser earnings a miner could get . High difficulty means less earning too?
