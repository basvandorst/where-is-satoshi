They can basically seize whatever they want to get the equivalent or more of what they’re asking of you. I have a friend that’s in Germany now because of tax trouble he got himself into years ago, and he’s never coming back.

And honestly if you’re still holding from when you bought at the top, you may be in the green by the end of the year. Which would mean if you were long on bitcoin there was never a bad time to buy. But who knows, lol buckle up.

One scenario would be hyper inflation, if you store wealth in something that doesn’t correlate with the market you could be one of the few that aren’t hit hard by a financial downturn. No one knows what’s going to happen to Bitcoin during a financial crisis, but there’s a decent chance it becomes a safe haven. Truly wealthy people put their money into assets, like houses, gold, art and many more, but there’s never been an asset like bitcoin that you could liquidate yourself and have that cash nearly on demand. A lot easier than trying to sell a multimillion dollar home.. what if you only wanted half of that money, it would be pretty hard to sell a fraction of that home. Bitcoin being so divisible is an incredible asset for the wealthy. While it may not have been Sathoshi’s vision, it certainly has an amazing use case as a store of wealth. 
Of course this would mean the market would have to mature.
Sorry for the ramble, I’m not going back to edit it.
@_date: 2019-07-07 12:15:57
The wealthy will own bitcoin as a safe haven asset. A lot of people will be selling all the way up, some slower than others. But eventually, there will be more people who were previously wealthy holding the coins.

He does have Bakkt’s launch on the 22nd in his corner. If you’re more of a fundamentalist. Although they’re still waiting on the green light.

Nothing to see here, carry on.

Had a friend sell at 17k and then Bought back in at 18k because he thought it may never drop below 20k again. No one knows. (But yes, he f’d up)
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:08:57
This could be shutdown by the government someday. I’d be surprised if they let Zuckerburg essentially become a bank.
@_date: 2019-02-01 05:19:21
I personally would buy 2k now and gradually keep buying in increments like that over time, just in case it does go down. Maybe monthly.
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:13:50
They submitted their plans to the CFTC less than a week before BAKKT. We will probably see BAKKT and Eris X approved by the end of the first week in July.

Loved it, but if I could tweak it I’d take the Neo part out of it. I’d be spreading this video like wildfire to friends and family if that weren’t in there. It’s a good reference if that’s truly how he felt, but kind of takes away from the legitimacy of everything being covered.
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:34:30
That would be years down the line, at that point bitcoin will be 2-5 years stronger.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:37:18
I don’t think 10k is going to cause the fomo we’re all waiting for. I’m excited for the near and long term future but I think we’ll still hang around 10k-11k for a little bit.  NOT TA. Literally based off of nothing... kind of like TA.
@_date: 2019-06-19 12:55:36
Unless it get’s killed off in its infancy. I don’t think it will, but if the government wanted to shut it down before it started they probably could. There is a target for them, being Mark. It wouldn’t be too hard to impose their will.

He’s not talking about the price.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:28:47

There’s a lot of training to get to the moon, those guys have to have a lot of discipline. If you’re a HODLer make sure you buy some play coin, so you aren’t tempted to sell off some of your hodl BtC at new ATHs.

It is a total desert in social media right now. It’s probably different for you based on your search history. Bitcoin is no longer on anyone’s radar. It’s that thing that went up to 20k and then plummeted to them.

Was not an inside job. But they don’t need the money and even if we as a community donated millions it would probably go unreported. The Catholic Church is one of the best scams going right now, they don’t need the money.

Why would you want to pay your rent in bitcoin right now? Maybe in 10-20 years

A 20,000 BTC order within an hour in the midst of BTC going sideways for months is a little different.

Good luck, but just because you’d like to buy again at $4,200 doesn’t mean it’s going to happen.

What are you doing to update your wallet? I have a Trezor but was just going to leave that thing alone for 10 years.
Would someone like myself... Not a techie, but competent enough to set up and transfer my funds to my trezor. ... be better off with something like a BRD or Mycelium wallet and just make sure that is using BIP39? Been debating this for a bit but don’t know quite enough to make a decision.

I messed up and told some random guy at the bar that Bitcoin is going to go back up, back when it was at $3,500 a coin. Now I can’t help but think this shadeball probably didn’t buy. But he’ll remember me. Learned my lesson. Drunken bitcoin talk...
