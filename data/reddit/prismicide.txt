We understand that point and you just need to pair your personal reader with your smart phone (or tablet). You can see your personal reader as your own secure payment terminal. You don't have to trust anything outside of what you control and anything can be audited.

We all liked their old "sci-fi" project video, one of us even encountered their team last year and clearly discussed and understood their problems... It was fun to believe in a solar powered P2P pure radio with people sharing gateways... and done by guys with no practical secure element or radio experience... 
...but it was just not realistic. At all. 
Their ideas were nice but their project is dead now and for good reasons. 
Parts of our team are professionals from smart cards and wireless technologies industries, we clearly know what can be done and what is just a pleasant dream. We value reality.

Hi, thanx for your comment, NFC WISP seems to be a cool gadget, but I don't really understand the use of such device or technology in our project.
We are using standard "contact" smart cards and personal reader has wireless (Bluetooth) connectivity, nothing related to NFC. For many reasons we considered NFC as on option in the past but now we are sure it is a dead end we won't explore.
The keys are protected by the smart card and are never exposed, even to the reader. The transaction signature is done inside the smart card. Even the owner/user can't extract the private keys from the card. We are using BIP32 Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet technology to ease the initial seed backup process.
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:45:25
The smart card do not use bluetooth. The reader can use bluetooth to connect to smart phones and tablets... or USB to connect to desktop computers.
The smart card is the most secure way to store and use private key... and provides transaction signing (and lots of other features...)
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:39:35
We'll work with Armory to make it compatible. Everything is opened and we do not want to compete with software wallets developers but to work with them.
For now, it can hold several private keys based on one seed.
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:07:26
For now, I don't think the name is really important... 
We'll probably change the name later... mostly for the Bictoin application :) 
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:52:00
Right. And with the backuped seed, you can prepare one or several backup cards if you want :) 
@_date: 2014-07-16 14:01:51
Thanx for your kind words !

Thanx for your comment. (Parts of this answer will be used as an update for the first post)
- We already have the smart card operating system. The company that already provides BTCHIP.com samples and hardwarewallet.com bitcoin smart cards wallets will open its source code on a special branch for this project.
- We already port our open source operating system to this ARM Cortex familly architecture (main personal reader chipset).
- We already selected hardware parts, electronic-prototyping will be done this summer.
- A [working raspberry pi based prototype]( will be demonstrated at the official Bitcoin Fundation event "bitcoin2014" (Amsterdam, 15/16/17th may)
- We still don't want to provide a precise timeline... first units will be available this year for sure and we'll probably go to indiegogo.com later this month to accelerate/amplify the project...
(see above our other answer about the "project name" :) )
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:41:48
Name will probably change. We are ready to read design suggestion. Smart card readers are usually a lot uglier than our last design suggestions :). By the way, the first models casing will be done with 3D printers, so if you want something else... we can discuss that... For my own information, I am ready to read your own ideas.
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:54:05
Too widely used for lots of things. :)
But the name will probably change. We'll be opened for suggestions after the campaign.

You probably did not look the full video : 
We are building our own personal reader (even if cards could be used elsewhere with less security), so yes, this secure personal reader will use Bluetooth for smartphones and tablets.
I do work with NFC phones, cards and devices on a day-to-day basis (in fact... that's my full time job...) 
NFC performances may vary from phone to phone to nightmarish non sens (I won't even talk about iPhones that don't even have NFC). Even with the "good" phones, using tags is easy, but using real cryptography with real contactless PKI smart cards is usually pure madness... And even if those problematic layers were solved : smart phones &amp; tablets really can't be trusted, from malware threats to built-in trojan (like  ) or PRISM like tools &amp; attacks, 0day exploit, MITM and so on... 
That's why we choose a real new, fully open, independent road :) People won't even have to trust us, everyone will be able to audit the solution, from software to hardware.
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:39:32
Yeah, you are right, the initial motivation for the project was to provide the highest level of security available right now to the open source community. Smart cards are mostly closed tools used by security industry for the most critical clients like energy industry, military... but there was no open source solution to help people against global data surveillance programs like PRISM (or XKeyscore, Tempora...).
So the name means "Let's get rid of PRISM" like in insecticide.
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:56:09
The document do not contain anything about private keys ... this confusion can be really an evil move... This is clearly what I want to know. If state should be able to seize bitcoins... it means that licensed operator should have a copy of private keys accounts... yes, that do not make sens... but do not underestimate stupidity.
@_date: 2014-05-05 00:56:07
Thanx for your comment. (Parts of this answer will be used as an update for the first post)
There are ongoing discussions about the "project name" inside our members.... here is the situation :
Yes, indeed, this project came from the rage we all felt while reading last year PRISM related news, and we don't want to loose that rage for now because it is still parts of what fuels us while working (for free) during insane amounts of time on this project. (And no need to speak about the 2007 crisis for the Bitcoin part...)
So.. yes, while the project will make further steps, the Bitcoin application / use case will probably have its own name and perhaps even disappear as an "open smartcard option" for other Bitcoin software wallets. In fact, once our SDK/API will be released, we'll help people to integrate this solution to their own software wallets. That's why we want to have EVERYTHING opened, we'd like to become an open standard.
So, to answer your concern, we are sure we'll find a way, one day, when project will evolve, to transform rage into "just strength" but for now, we are still assuming our part of rage :)
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:48:45
9000$ is great. I do not completely understand the use of their device... but I am not into wallet papers... I like to spend my bitcoins with some kind of security ;) 
@_date: 2014-05-11 02:15:56
* an open source and open hardware solution with better protection :
PRISMicide for Bitcoin
Open hardware wallet Open based on open source smart card and open source/hardware personal reader
You were not the only one to hope "it would be nice :)"
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:36:28
1) you are able to backup the wallet (it is a HD Wallet with a seed you can backuped : you can regenerate lost cards or have duplicate cards)
2) The reader shows you the transaction details before validation.
3) It is not huge. Even the first version will be small. :) And I am sure we'll be able to go smaller after that.
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:59:05
I'll try to find the time to understand how to reclaim that ;=)

For people who understands how critical it is important to have...
* ...an open source and open hardware Bitcoin wallet :
**PRISMicide for Bitcoin**:
**Introduction video**:
Open smart card based solution with open reader.
Smart card uses an open source OS.
Smart card application is open source.
Personal reader uses an open source OS.
Personal reader application is open source.
Personal reader firmwares will be open source.
Personal reader is open hardware.
No compromise.
At all.
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:26:52
Thanx! Please consider make a little comment on the campaign page ! 
you are right for the seed backup mechanism...
... and we'll focus on secure messaging just after Bitcoin application. :)
@_date: 2014-05-11 02:05:06
... and you are right. This is just another crappy android platform with no real secure element / hardware protection... and you have to trust unknown chinese guys... what a great idea... :(
* OPEN SOURCE &amp; OPEN HARDWARE ALTERNATIVE FOR AN HARDWARE WALLET... 
That is one of the reason why our own team is creating on open source and open hardware solution, based on smart card security (the highest security available right now on earth, yeah, we mean it :) ).
Most of the members of our team are embedded security experts and simply do not want to trust any closed source based solution.

ok... thanx! and whatever, the name will change, and I am sure we are on the same side :) 
@_date: 2014-05-06 22:05:36
ok, now I get it but we won't add a NFC chipset to do out of the band BT pairing for some smart phones. Since both devices have screens and virtual keyboards, we'll probably use Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) with PassKey option.
@_date: 2014-07-16 13:31:41
Please read the campaign page and watch the video.
This device was thought as a privacy tool from the start. It is not just for crypto-currencies. It is the first independant open source &amp; open hardware reader with a tft/touch screen. It uses the first open source OS based smart card. 
Believe us, it is the kind of security tool NSA do not want to deal with :)

@_date: 2014-07-16 13:15:34
With smart cards, your private keys are never exposed. Never. Even the reader do not have access to the private key, so they can't be stolen.
Name is not important for now and will probably change. We'll be opened to suggestion after the campaign.
PIN protection is important for smart card security. If you do not want to use our reader, smart card API will be opened (and will be very similar to this :  so if you want to develop your own software to be able to enter your PIN on your (probably less secure) personal computer, you should be able to do so. Even if we won't recommend that by default :)
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:02:29
Important question about this point "Virtual currency accounts not active for 5 years must be handed over to the state." This is nowhere stated like this in the document (as far as I know)... but indeed there is this (page 21):
"Records of non-completed, outstanding, or inactive Virtual Currency accounts or transactions shall be maintained for at least five years after the time when any such Virtual Currency has been deemed, under the Abandoned Property Law, to be abandoned property"
Are you this means that the state should be able to seize inactive accounts ? Because if this is true... this means a lot.
Like the FACT THAT THE OPERATOR MUST OWN AT LEAST A COPY OF YOUR PRIVATE KEY...
Or did I miss something ?
wow I read and read the document... this so fucked up as many points can't really be applied...
