bitcoin does not go anywhere. it's the subjectively perceived value that moves. say i have 1 satoshi that is worth nothing, yet i still want to be a gazilionaire, so I can't sell it now. People that mined or bought btc when it was &lt; 1USD may feel different about selling it for 10k, than ppl coming in later invested thousands of dollars thay had to earn. it will go up because i am not selling you mine, niether is my mom.

this is no longer true with BIP allowing mnemonic seed (wasn't really true before either, but before valuation of bitcoin nobody cared if they lose those 3USD worth of btc), you can either memorize or write down your keys in plain text.

the pattern of volatility will be affected with the amount of new users added to the network in coming hype period. 2017 is when media started to pay attention. Single article about a country banning btc moved the price. Single big firm press conference had a massive impact. Then in Q1 2018 when 'everybody' was jumping ship, there were not many people around to tell you. This time we will have 2017 survivors.
I think we are going to see a very strong network effect this very cycle (Q4 2018 - Q12019) and things will be very different from now.
tl;dr - bitcoin will not volatile forever, adoption is not going to be linear.

problem is Bitcoin doesn't know it's dead. In fact, it probably thinks it's doing just fine. Also, Bitcoin is not aware of it's price. 
the idea that mathematical rules can reach consensus of human interaction is not dead. Implication of instant and uncensored microtransaction is not yet realized. we are all waiting for a killer app, while it is obvious that an unbiased, cheap and transparent voting system must be such killer app. We will however not see this until unique identity problem is resolved.
What we will see in the meantime is use cases for these microtransactions, especially in Arts.   
Currently, DJs have to buy music if they want to play at top tier parties. You pay for a song and then end up never playing it anywhere. what if you could download whatever music you want for absolutely free, practice your sets, and once you are ready you just log into a CDJ decks in the club, which will stream all your music you have assigned and will bill you only for what (and how much) you have actually commercially used, directly to the artist/producer.

I think you are spot on. "we have no idea tf this is, but there is a way to make money out of it". 
however, I trully hope that when the upcoming economical crisis kicks in it will break their necks. Imagine you short it with 5x leverage, dump 50 mil and nothing happens. they be like ehmmm, needs more dump, bigger leverage. so they will dump all they can 100x to trigger the price move. and it won't.

6k is already extreme. there are people on 100USD per month salary still buying bitcoin. they understand 1 bitcoin is worth 5 years of their labor at current wage, provided it stays at 6k for 5 years. They are still buying it.
Now, US has probably (can't be arsed to search, sorry) highest capital alocation per individual. Means 6k is 1 month's salary for many people. when the price will go to 50k, 'regular' people in US will realize that they can never have one full bitcoin. If this is socially accepted (you are not a loser if you have less than 1 btc), it would fly past 100k in a massive hype and FUD from the social group of people owning most of the world's legacy capital. That should be such a massive shift that the richest 10% would have to start acting and bam! it's done.

maybe worth to notice if this is transition format or native segwit?


this will happen naturally with services built on top of LN, that is built on top of segwit. at some point it will be easier to write an app (wallet) in a framework (like wordpress) already with segwit and integrate it to new services than to migrate existing software.


once we hit 50% and bitcoin doesn't die (it won't), it will be obvious that "segwit is good". At this point, the actual % will no longer be important adoption wise. Much more interesting metric would be to watch LN nodes/channels/services/txs/amounts.
Then, at some point, protocol update would be propossed to discontinue sending to old "non batchable" format  because of some technical reason and suddenly nobody would object (or fork as Satoshi's Truest Vision, yada yada) - but it will be a minority.
After that, years later you witness a person moving his btc from an old format wallet and it would look like if you see your friend loading a file from a 3.5" floppy disc in 2018. It would work, but it would be very, very weird.

Are they going to run their own node? are they going to update the sw on wallet? IF the pubkey leaks or is shared, do they want such transparency?

maybe this is my problem right here, not being able to see any 1st world govt being anywhere near ready yet. Most what settled institutions did so far was trying to define what it actually is using their old terms and constructs.
Current government structure has most of the income from taxes (and import duties/suspension tariffs, esp. US, lmao) and Bitcoin would change it all. 
let's not forget it's 2018 and zero of the most powerful govts did acknowledge that war on drugs is a crime against humanity - simply because, well, $$.
so, if the govt is not ready to let go of taxes, they are not ready to adopt bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-03-08 14:06:13
I have worked with governments (in countries that could be considered as progressive and developed) and their respective ministries of finance on a technical sw dev/implementation, which is the reason why I am very sceptical about their ability to hold bitcoin. There is no administrative framework for responsibility over financial asset - which is completely outsourced to banks and insurance cartels.
It would require a clearly stated project requirements to integrate bitcoin specifically (i.e. none of the current blockchain future bullshit), and then given avg implementation times, it would take 2 years to SPECIFY the solution and prepare all legislative groundwork. then you are looking at 2 years of development and testing.
Authorities of developed countries are in a corner of their own regulation that prevents them from buying in.
With growing number of countries that have nothing to lose, this will probably be a very different story, as the pressure for administrative correctness will probably be insignificant.

sorry but having experience in legacy markets does not give you any advantage in Bitcoin. Quite the contrary, all analyst are trying to use existing methods and definitions over new asset class that does not share any attribute with legacy asset except for having a price.

perhaps you don't, but you are deliberately choosing a limited viewpoint  (bitcoin as an asset) with self serving rationalization (whole community is just moonbois). 
you won't get far like this either.   
regarding explaining bitcoin, it's difficult not because the protocol is too complicated, but because everybody need to understand a different part of the system to 'get it'. Also, nothing will give you the same insight into what is this about as getting some small amount of bitcoin and make few transactions with it.
@_date: 2019-03-08 13:45:11

point is this will happen in 100 years or so (2140 is not accurate due to avg blocktime being lower than 10 mins) which is hard to imagine given at least current rate of innovation/disruption. Currently there are clear security benefits in using POW, there is no reason to stay like that for 100 years timeframe.
In 50 years you could mine bitcoin with your actual heartbeat, for example.
this argument is like going back to 1999 and seeing the websites you had to host yourself, extrapolate that into future and claim that it will be a problem when content gets too big, people will not have economic incentive to create a website because of storage/hardware cost. If improvement was linear, this would have been the case.


it will be a very different bitcoin, though.
tl;dr - this will be a non-issue halfway into time when last btc is mined.

who will set up full nodes if there is no economic incentive to do so? 
@_date: 2018-10-24 12:58:53
1. dualistic power distribution (left vs right, rep vs dems,...) is artificial and not representative
2. 4 year election terms allow alibism/strategizing and incentivize spending within the term (previous govt did it, not running for office during crisis, ...)
3. has no incentive to represent poor and/or unhealthy people
4. has no incentive to debate long term goals and visions (such as environment, modern education, informatization)
5. cannot keep up the pace with the innovation of technology as it used to (compare FAA/EASA regulations for civil aviation vs regulations for personal drones)
6. most important/impactful decisions are done in secret without participation of its citizens (army/warfare decisions, secret services,...)
1. law enforcement (esp. police force) - relatively flexible in responding to local threats or panic-prevention/control
2. capability to arrange vertical solidarity in health insurance (half argument as it is not the case in the US), but without centralized power it is almost impossible to have working health insurance.
3. predictability - doesn't change over night, what worked yesterday will probably work today too, if you got your unemployment last month, you will prob get it next one too. Also half argument because this can change rather quickly especially in developing countries.
in conclusion centralized governance is cancer, however fully decentralized governments are not possible to transit into directly (for example due to limited possibility to control panic/crisis). imho a hybrid-solution will be needed in the interim, therefore it would be more effective to introduce decentralized governance entity as a principle into current centralized structure. 
tl;dr: decentralized governance will not arrive suddenly. fully decentralized govts may not be preferable/possible in short term.

hi, since I was probably the one mentioning the crisis just wanted to step in and say I agree, basically. I can see an argument that Bitcoin needed 2008 one, though that is off topic.
Also, Bitcoin already succeeded. It is already a P2P global network. and a fucking awesome one.

Dutch banking giant ING also published a statement last year, calling bitcoin a fraud and claiming that "anybody can copy the blockchain, making it worthless". what this Dutch giant says about bitcoin means absolutely nothing, nor it is ever going to matter.
@_date: 2018-06-26 17:42:07
I have not worked for ING in their Amsterdam office, but I can copy paste like a boss:
"**Executive summary**
In the long term, Bitcoin has little to offer a wider audience, and will likely return to being a niche product for a select group of enthusiasts. What they regard as key benefits, may actually be impediments to wider adoption. Moreover, Bitcoin’s high-value today is based on shaky foundations, given that the platform is open source and can, therefore, be forked and copy-pasted easily."

that is like, your opinion, man. imo income tax is bullshit and should end. problem solved.


if it's a P2P service - fuck taxes.
it is not yet common to have a full time contract and payment in bitcoin will most likely be set in FIAT rate per month or FIAT hourly rate. so you get X amount of FIAT but in bitcoin at current rate.
paying taxes happens once a year, doesn't need to be borderless, uncensorable and immutable, not even fast. just given tx amounts this is the least important (half ass 3rd party) implementation of bitcoin payment up to date.

in practice it's probably correct, however the block reward cannot be spent immediately. Also, this assumes that there are no other actors entering the market and trying to sell btc (they did not mine).  
So I would say, that if miners did not try to sell the block reward (at all) then 0USD would have to enter each 10 mins to keep the price at current level.

my mind is easily changed by reason, but you did not use any. your argument for on chain voting based on the fact that govts know the number of people is too simple for me to seriously argue with it.   


I gave it a little more thought and I am calling bullshit again. Even if authorities knew the total amount of eligible voters, how would they know if the person's vote was in fact made by that person? how do you prove your identity online? do you want to store your credentials details on-chain?   
There is not going to be any valid online identity without a chip (and before you set off to your learned responses, this doesn't mean the chip itself will store any data about you). One could build a system from which identity is an emerging quality of the system's parts, without having a place that holds your credentials anywhere.
  
 Also, you are not capable to see outside your social bubble, there are 1.5 billion adults that have no government ID around the world.  


you did not share ideas yet, only assumptions and reciting your local propaganda - I just want to let you know that this looks so weird/funny for non-Americans. the fact that you suggested voting again if majority wanted to vote again shows that you did not think this through at all.

it hasn't been effectively banned yet, and for any legal decision, you need executional power, which costs ~~money~~ fiat. at which point the taxpayers are going to mind having their taxes used against them?  
i think bitcoin is past banning stage as a protocol (mind you nothing like it ever existed, you can't say larger markets have been banned, there are no larger markets to compare), and it would be very innefective to ban it now, and soon enough, not embracing it would equal to be excluded from the global trade.

if bitcoin does not fail as a protocol (means all further tools will be built on something else), the price will go up to infinity compared to any today's Fiat. Problem is when and how.  
This might not even be worth calculating because there is no mathematical basis of individual irrational behavior. But there is for collective behavior, which is rather predictable.  
What these 'pundits' are doing is merely pointing out the exponentiality of adoption and it is an interesting and valid point (regardless of their agenda).   
In my experience, whenever we consider 2 options that reality can go in, it always finds a third way, just to blow your mind.

I find it ridiculous that people are paying capital gains or any tax on bitcoin/crypto. there is no reason also, as unlike with other markets, this market is not benefiting from any governmental regulation, therefore what are people paying for exactly?
also, you don't ever physically own any bitcoin. only thing you have is "ACCESS" to bitcoin wallet. you private keys does not appreciate in value, it's just an information. Even if any govt can link you to original purchase on coinbase, when you move your bitcoin to hardware wallet, you are outside of KYC already. if you are in control of your keys, there is no legal way that it can be proven that you did not lose or forget the seed.
now I understand that especially in the US, many people are motivated to oblidge and can be royally fucked if they try to play this game in their legal system. just please understand taxing decentralized crypto is bullshit, what you do over there is not a standard and it is not sustainable.
EDIT: I acknowledge that if you trade under KYC or sell to your bank account you are making traces but then again, don't do such things.

I think you are correct when talking about the specific instance of a given technology, it may appear exponential at the beginning but will reach it's limitations. But if you look at progress in itself, there does not seem to be a limiting factor.
Computers/CPUs may reach silicone limitations at some 7nm or less even, but *"computing capacity"* can still increase exponentially, even if some part of it reached it's limitations (example, HDDs/SSDs).
I would also like to argue that today is very different from the past and the difference is internet. There are some properties or effects of this level of communication that allows exponential (looking) growth to spark from anything and much faster than ever.

bitcoin is your power to write information on the ledger. every transaction is a statement on the ledger, if there is an output, that is arbitrary.
you can store a link to a news article about an event on the ledger and it will be there forever, protected by all hashing power ever since. Bitcoin's ledger is the ultimate freedom of speech, we just didn't get past lambo stage yet and did not notice, maybe.

what does that mean? Any business can already create a simple interface and broadcast a hash of any of their information on the Bitcoin's ledger, and connect the hash to the entry in their db.
If it's more complicated use case, they could develop second or third layer protocol that woud suit the requirements. Why creating shitcoins? how to secure them? Should the industrial token have same qualities as Bitcoin? If not, why creating a suboptimal system? If yes why creating what already exists?

do you realize how ridiculously complicated it is to trace mixed outputs?


is a lead all you have, your honor?


every time you spend 0.01 btc from an address with a balance of 0.1 btc, it empties the original address, creating two outputs. one to you (with change, but to a new address) and one to the merchant. how would anyone know which one is you and which one is merchant for example. so, do you have 0.09 or 0.01?
and even if, how can it be proven that it was you who made any transaction? there are multisig wallets, so I can have a fund with 20 people and say you need 2/20 sigs to make a transaction.
bitcoin is an absolute mindfuck to 20th century legal system(which we still have). I am blown away it did not sync in yet.

it's crazy this is taken lightly. Could be wrong, but IMO the reason why Satoshi pseudonym was created in the first place was to avoid personal responsibility/accountability when it goes loose. Imagine you *invented* Bitcoin, and 10 years later every price move or FUD people would call your phone asking you to fix it?
Anyone stepping up claiming to be Satoshi cannot be Satoshi, because they clearly do not understand the implications (and not nice ones) which were the original motives of staying anonymous.
If we ever hear from Satoshi again is open for discussion, but it should be clear that even if we do, it will be an **online presence**, not a person talking to an audience/on camera. I think it is reasonable to assume that the motivation behind staying anonymous still stand.
sidenote: did CSW ever consider that claiming he is SN may be a very dangerous thing to do? Not only from the point of presumably having access to 1mil BTC, but in case someone out there does not like Bitcoin in a very fundamental way he is in luck, as his target is constantly and publicly identifying himself. I seriously think that his only fortune is that practically nobody believes him.

I will make a transaction in next block, and you tell me my Date of Birth, deal?
Bitcoin does not require your credentials. You don't put your name and other details into your wallet. Now exchanges can track it by association of the purchase transaction where you do have to put your details - but here's a trick:
*sorry officer, I lost all my bitcoin/keys/sent it to wrong address. I did not make this transaction you are talking about.*
You can prove I made the initial purchase transaction because it required access to my VISA/etc, but how do you prove I made transactions after the bitcoin is moved out of the exchange?

while I agree with ID being on chain as a necessary next step, I don't think that voting is something that should be implemented. Problem with current democracy are exactly votes. the fact that people voted for Brexit doesn't mean it was a good decision. also, it opens a pandora's box from security standpoint (how do you prevent bots?) and would ultimately require a microchip implant being mass adopted.  
at the same time, a governance system can work on Problem definition and be open to submit 'Solutions' from users, which could be 'semi-manually' aggregated and curated so each problem would end up with 1+ solutions to chose from (or implement more than 1).

banks are investing incredible amounts to innovate on par with an ~~open source~~ free software technology, that is being worked on for free.  
Problem is that regulation was created on top of the financial technical infrastructure (implemented checks and controls where it logically made sense in their SW architecture). Any innovation is limited by these self imposed points of regulation, so while bitcoin finds a problem - comes up with a solution - implements it, a bank would need to change the legislation first.

you are not wrong about status quo. My argument is metaphysical in a sense, not really interferring with the reality you are describing.   


you hit the nail on the head here, BUT:  
1. am I the same person(ality) irl that I am online? 
2. average person does not exist
If facebook analysed data of what is your lucky number of all it's users, and the result is 6.9, I can use this information and if I guess 7 with enough people, I would be statistically successful. But if average is 0.6 pregnant, 0.9 extrovert etc, it does not apply to the individual in the same sense as average number does.  
your prediction on a sample population is valid for the sample polulation, maybe with some limitation can be extrapolated to bigger population, but not smaller, i.e. I can predict that white males like cars and I can be correct, but then you will find the whitest, malest person who just can't stand them.


some countries are talking about it but from what I see I assume that currently most have other issues with higher priority. I think that people will realize the limitation of not having cash only once it's gone, so a country will be almost there in my book if they actually go thru the process and last at least few months without a serious backlash. Before then, they can do all kinds of legislation or software infrastructure, 'nobody' cares.

there is no price of Bitcoin yet.
I am not able to formulate my response into ELI5 format, maybe someone more knowledgable could help simplifying what I am trying to say, but:
There is only price of Bitcoin in FIAT. This value is calculated from  buying and selling transactions in real time. So this way, price in USD of ALL bitcoins is determined by trading a fraction of them valued at the moment. This method of measuring price does not consider people that are not selling because they don't want to, and people not buying because they already have enough.
we need to get off the USD reference frame (as a mind experiment for now to see the implication). Bitcoin will have value of itself when it could be generally said at some particular place that good espresso is 10 Sats, 30 Sats is too expensive and touristy, and less than 5 Sats expect a pisswater of coffee. This needs stable prices in Sats.
when BTC/USD price swings, it is hard to keep the coffee's price stable in BTC only if you operate in FIAT and just accept BTC. But a coffee place that pays utilities settled in BTC, buys coffee beans in BTC and pays employees in BTC would not have this issue, correct?
creating a value-based reference for Bitcoin by pricing goods and services will not be too welcomed at the beginning, and it would require a significant adoption (just more people using Bitcoin really) and a higher USD price even to begin in forming a value reference frame.
when you will commonly see ads for products priced in BTC, you might wonder how much USD is needed to get x amount of BTC to get that product from the ad. Until then, it will be fairly dramatic. To answer you question,


nobody knows and it can at any time, but what does a ticker price on centralized exchange mean, really?

my limited understanding tells me that there is just *nothing to hack.*   
while certain parts of the network can be hacked (if i hack your computer, and get access to your full node, and somehow gain the ability to temprer with data stored on your disk, i would only be able to fool you and not necessarily steal form you), the implication of having control over other user on same level (there is no root access to gain) is not as much of a security risk for the network.
at the same time, it is much easier to social engineer your way into getting someone's passwords/private keys and steal bitcoin than to breach the protocol and move all bitcoins to your address.   
Also, if you want to get rich by hacking bitcoin protocol, likely you will need bitcoin to work once it's done (and not lose value due to the hack).

even better question. it's getting increasingly difficult to discuss the governments in relation to Bitcoin on global platforms such as this one as we will always think about the govt we know.


Patents are 20th century zombies that will die soon. It kills innovation. Most of the time the actual inventor does not have means to jump through all the hoops to get the idea patented so it ends up with a corp. I think Tesla/SpaceX do not hold any patents and all of their tech should be free or under MIT licence (could be mistaken, though).
Regarding RSA, it is usually assumed that it's an encryption, but hash is something else. the result of hash function does not include the original information the same way as when you put a password on a ZIP file. When you look at the hash result, you cannot tell if the hash input (what you have hashed) was a Bitcoin's block, Beyonce's album or a PDF/JPEG.
Local authorities (not US nor UK) are using RSA since 2010 (I think) to prove the validity of invoices. This alone is enough of a proof to me at least that there is no backdoor to sha-256.

this is why being very rich is not easy - sometimes you have to spend a lot of money and make up a lot of bullshit to keep afloat. let's imagine how much $$ are going to be wasted on obsolete centralized technologies that will be hacked in their first week of existence.
my question is, what is going to be the tipping point in the future, when "business people" realize that it's not only the technology, but also its implementation what is valuable?

SHA algorithm produces same structure/lenght hash regardless of input (you get a unique hash of a video/pic and you coulnd't tell it from the hash of bitcoin block), so you can already do this (and it's how free software is verified incl bitcoin core) without much innovation. quite a low hanging fruit technologically imo, devil is in implementation.

1. HODL is a trading strategy? are you looking at everything through trading lenses? that is a major simplification.
2. data is not a problem (before analysis). you see, each statistical analysis method requires certain type of data. some can only use cardinal data (price), while some data will be nominal by design (I don't know, country, wallet?, maybe address format). I brought up gender research because it's an easy example.
First thing you do to your data in analysis is standardization (you have a variable of price, but for the statistical method you want to use you have to make a price a boolean value. So you introduce a threshold which did not exist in the data. You create a new variable called HasOneBTC, with values True for data points with value greater than 1BTC etc.) and conceptualization (you have to decide for your research what is bitcoin user - is trader a user? is holder a user? is there a threshold of btc owned to qualify? ). You remove data that does not qualify, because frankly, you said so. Also, you will never know if 1 bitcoin address belongs to multiple individuals, or multiple addresses belongs to 1 individual.
3. because of this, you have to try to squeeze some analysis from data already available, not looking for data based on your hypothesis. what data do we have? a time series with price. that is pretty much it. you have to make a selective decission when looking for events to explain the move. now we have 1k USD sudden rise. Is that because of 1 thing?
4. when you talk about bulls, you create a perception of wall street blazer kind of guy plotting against humanity. I am sure this is happening to some extent, but you absolutely have to disregard a possibility that the price has spiked because MANY small actors, because there is just no way to tell.
5. at the end of the data analyis, you have made so many changes to your data that there is no way to go through that with a person you are presenting the analysis. might as well just share the results, implying it's what the original data said. but it's not.
6. best tool to make money is money. rich people do not need analysis to decide, they need analysis to back the decision that was already made.

Some also lie. One dude was telling me a story today over lunch that he and his coworkers mined bitcoin on a 'company server'. To my puzzled question 'when' he replied half a year ago. When I claimed that they couldn't have mined jack's shit with any kind of a server even a year ago, he said they had GPUs. So I went on to explain that GPUs wouldn't mine jack's shit either to which he concluded that bitcoin is dead. He clearly did not mine anything (best case they were Nicehash kitties), but there was an incentive for him to claim as his experience what he heared from other people. At the same time, he thinks bitcoin is dead.

the price move has nothing to do with value (increase in price does not follow improvement of tech), no need for argument here.
but if you consider this as an investment, you will be locked in your perception of the world based on your experience. I mean, go ahead, but I just think that's boring af.
I like to explain (oversimplify) bitcoin as your capability to store data on the ledger. if you have 0.01 btc, you can make approximately *shitload* of transactions that will store immutable data.
Imagine there is one very tall shamanic Totem on the planet, and your btc is your sacred ink that can write or draw on the totem. Ink in your hand have potential value of the information that can be stored on the medium. If I think the Totem is stupid, I still need the ink to draw an oversize dick on it. 
This has incredible use cases. When I send you btc, I am transferring my capabilities to make a 'change' on the blockchain to you. That is the value I transfer.
Also, fiat is for pussies.

there is a very interesting social phenomenon, that 'regular' western people do not see the difference between poor people that live on $10 a day and 1$ a day because the difference is $9, but really, it's 10x more. Can you imagine the difference if you had 10x more income?  
My point is, we will not see it coming, because we will not be able to recognize it, until it affects the richest few % of people.

I wanted to merely point out that what seems stupid to you may be smart for other people in different situation than yours. The fact that you are unable to see this makes you wrong, regarldless of the point you are arguing.

cash transactions are irreversible. If you need such services (remember, reversing or refunding stolen funds is not a property of FIAT, it's a service of banks) - by all means use Fiat.  
 


Bitcoin as a protocol is not much more difficult than say IPV6. Both are too technical for most people. Latter is however used by 'most'.


once people buying power will go downhill, people will get pissed


its too easy to freeze or seize someone's FIAT assets without a valid reason

it depends on provider and location/area. usually (from  those I have seen) there is a limit (arnd 100EUR) for purchase without KYC. Overall, I would say that these ATMs are great for first experiments with small amount bitcoin transactions. Also, 2-way ATMs are starting to pop up (and it did not seem to require KYC for FIAT withdrawals, but I did not actually go thru the process)

while I applaud you for bashing the murks for their ignorance, I don't agree that intelligence (or IQ) is correlated to understanding. Imagine you have IQ 300, would you understand bitcoin if you never ever read anything about it? But you could surely use that IQ to orchestrate rationalizations to back up your pre-determined sentiment/judgement/bias.
to put it into an extreme to demonstrate my point, I would like to argue that the person with IQ50 could understand bitcoin (whatever that means) just as well as someone with IQ150. Likely, the expressive tools needed and time invested will differ, but the equation smart person = (more likely/more deeply) understands bitcoin, stupid person = does not get bitcoin is completely false.
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:57:51
eventually is a long time, so why not. but it won't be anytime soon. There is no reason yet, as long as full nodes contains a block in which your address has some BTC, it does not really matter for the new address format in the latest blcock from technical point of view where is the output coming from.
What I expect to happen sooner, is that you will not be allowed to send BTC to non-segwit address if it would be deemed less secure and a 'good practice'.
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:57:02


ok, then. Your perspective does not come from understanding the protocol however. This is a fact I can back up.  
truth is, bitcoin does not need "institutional investors", does not give a shit about public opinion, nor price. it's just a protocol, that is made of other protocols, built on internet, which is made of protocols. It cannot be governed because there is nothing to govern. It's not sexy, but actually quite boring and that is why people are personifying it with all kinds of traits. "Crypto space" my ass.
Most importantly, Bitcoin does not care what you (or I, for that matter) think and it will prove it to you.

ok. granted. I would still prefer to think it solves an already solved problem in better way. When you gamble your money on stocks or bonds, it is not fully in your control but are at mercy of a centralized authority.  
Also, Bitcoin is effectively better than gold/diamonds. Recently read an article about that gold structure is much more understood - it's now possible to change gold's state from solid to liquid with electric current. Soon you might be able to generate enough pressure to manufacture "real" diamonds.

no it doesn't. You can manipulate what you want, I'll still have the same amount and could still use it the same way.

yeah? but it's not the same safety as the richest person no? Is it worth storing your yearly income of $200 into a safe that costs half a mil? Or would you dig a hole behind the village? Security is relative.


oh, but this is undisputable. but to some use cases, it might be worth it. Cash carries germs. that can be a big disadvantage. again, all depends on risk/reward. Might not be worth it for you, might be very well worth memorizing 12 words for me.


in your scenario, when you can generate social pressure on FB or sue the shit out of somebody, do it. Not everyone can. And even for you, there might be scenarios where you will not be in position to do it. Are you going to sue a sex worker for scamming you if you are married? Are you gonna flame them on FB? Probably no, right?

@_date: 2018-12-13 17:20:26


oh but this is a different question. I did not list any problem that bitcoin solves for 'normal' person as you defined it. Now thinking about it, most likely it will be microtransactions with further implementation of Schnorr/Scriptless scripts -  'normal' people could for example pay for streaming. It's currently not viable to pay say $0.005 for listening to a song online because the fees will be $3.  
but if you are willing to step out of your bubble:
1. freedom of speech: genesis block contains a string "chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks". Literally a middle finger. Nobody can do anything about it. This has not existed before Bitcoin.
2. International money transfer: faster and cheaper than any bank.
3. Anonymous online transaction: it's commonly debated, but truth is that if you want to be anonymous, you can.
4. Pension plan hedge: with current demographic trends, there is no way in hell pension plans will be sustainable in 20 years. The chance is literally zero. Bitcoin having greater value in 20 years is non-zero chance.
5. Creates communities and social structures that did not or could not exist before.
I am probably missing a few.

because there was no bitcoin mining before 2012.


yeah, nah, that's not how it works.


So? that doesn't say anything about bitcoin. This entire discussion we are having seems so outlandish to me. All of your arguments were already said, years ago, and were formulated in much better way. On top of it, most badass hackers tried to kill bitcoin for 10 years. Most regulators tried to ban it for 10 years. All this shit already happened. Did it die?  
all you are saying is that this time its different. and it is. the protocol has never been this solid and no-coiners like you were much more pissed.
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:38:24
correct, and from my limited knowledge on how financial transactions actually work I would be super surprised to hear that anybody can reverse a bank transaction. It would most likely be a forced return transaction, I.E. centralized authority creates new TX in opposite direction, not deleting the original/fradulent TX.  
can be wrong though.

100%. to add to this, I woul actually like to argue that price on centralized exchanges are only a part of price discovery. another part is pricing services and goods directly in bitcoin and this is starting to happen on micropayment scale.
@_date: 2018-12-26 21:36:50


good old child porn argument, yes. it's so obviously wrong there's not much point in discussing it, however, we need to find a generally accepted way to refute this fallacy. We are oversold on the extent to which the authority is capable to keep 'us' safe.   
almost as if there was a moral standard to which all of us can adhere to as ethical role model. Normal person has nothing to hide. Normal person also does not exist. Each of us act in context of the situation we find ourselves in.   


this stick has two ends, if we accept that us 'normal' folks are an entity. But all morality aside, there is 100% going to be a solution to resolve digital identity problem. Their (banks, corps, govts) motivation is to make money (control is also money) not to keep the system safe or even fair. This is where 'we' can get very lucky.   
**That system is going to be S.H.I.T., it cannot not be.** We need it to be created and fail miserably. This way we won't need to argue whether you have anything to hide, we could just point a finger. At the same time, do we actually have an alternative?  
If Bitcoin experiment taught us anything, its that if you want an ideal system, you can't wait for the authority to make it for you. We need to BUIDL our own solution quietly with no marketing or pushing it to the public's throat for adoption. Once the horrendous shitstorm of security breach comes, there will be an alternative ready.   
My favourite color is red. I don't need to hide it. I also don't need any authority to know.
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:31:42

what you are describing is that it's not usable in commercial market. How often do you go to a grocery store that is not a chain store and therefore not a corporation? Its P2P money, it is much more usable in P2P context such as farmer's markets. 


I can guarantee you that there are users that don't speak english, barely know anything about computers or internet and are using it daily. How is that possible?  
you base your preception on your social context:


and then: 


People in your social buble do not know about bitcoin because there is no need for them to go and learn all of it.

what does that mean? I am open to all scepticism of the concept or the tech. reason I engage in discussions with naysayers is because I want to know the arguments against. I have not heared one argument that will change my mind yet. Most of the time people argue with very simplified points of view and thinking of absolutes. I'll gladly change my mind when the argument is solid, not bs. you don't even have one.  
you, on the other hand engage in discussion for validation of your perception. what you don't understand you call stupid. When called out, you go for strawmans (everyone is emotional all the time about everything, it's how shit works, not sure what's your point).

I think this is bad news.
Jesse, the problem is the approach those companies are taking. most of these are banks that feel their core business is going downhill lately. Most international banks have "Digital ID" departments. Their idea is that you would access all of the internet via their internet banking as an interface. This is a literal hell.   
what is a fundamental (not regulatory) need for your business to identify the customers? You only need to know that the activity on this account is done by the same person who created the account (i.e. it's not stolen). No need to know their name, or any other data. In different scenario, If I could digitally prove I have a valid driving licence, why would a police officer need to know anything else about me?
