It's not an ATM in the traditional sense. It's more of a vending machine. From my understanding the process is like:  
1) Insert coins  
2) Input your wallet address  
3) Machine sends appropriate amount of BTC to the input wallet address  
for buying BTC with cash money. To sell BTC it's more like:  
1) Tell machine you'd like to get cash money  
2) Send BTC to the specified wallet address on the machine  
3) When transaction is confirmed, it will spit out cash like an ATM machine.  
The latter is subject to identity check (govt issued ID, retina scan, blood sample from your first born child, etc) depending on your country's laws.
