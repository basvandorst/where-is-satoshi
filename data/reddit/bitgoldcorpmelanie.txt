The bonuses we give out, whether for birthday or referral, are real gold. We know that not every person who signs up will ultimately decide to use the platform, so the bonuses are reclaimed after a period of inactivity of 60 days (inactivity meaning no logins or deposits on the account). Gold is a finite element and it would be illogical to potentially leave these small bonuses in forgotten accounts. This period gives users time to decide if the platform is right for them.

We have already posted an official message here on Reddit to respond to any concerned redditors, and have updated this user on the status of their account review. Unfortunately we cannot provide any more information.

It is not the amount that is uncommon - that is actually very common on the platform. It is the circumstances surrounding this user that are uncommon.

There seems to be some confusion - this is absolutely not a regular user case. As I originally noted, "We know the identity of the specific user who has made these posts because their situation is most definitely not a common one on the BitGold platform." For 99% of users, if we require additional information in addition to the typical KYC, we do not suspend the account, we simply request the additional information from them. In this case, a suspension was absolutely necessary. My apologies if I had not made the seriousness of this situation more clear.
