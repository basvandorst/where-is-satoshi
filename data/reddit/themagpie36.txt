Yeah, the problem is you'll agree with the youtube or reddit news that confirms *your* position. Anyway this is pretty much impossible to avoid. I will say that there is definitely am advantage of knowing what the mainstream media says, just as much as trusting what your favoured source is.

I think that many people don't realise that most of us are just very small fish in a very big pond. There are people that buy new luxury cars every week from trading while we are ecstatic with a gain of $200 from a quick trade. 
Everything is relative. $180k for this guy could be like $1.80 for me.

It's been talked about before (here in Europe) that you stop selling things for $39.99 and just round it up to the nearest 5. Do now you must sell that toaster at $39.95 (if you want stupid people to think they are buying a toaster for 30 rather than 40) or sell it for $40.

I pretty much only invest in 2 coins. I am 90% in on XLM (Stellar) and I believe that it is about 70:30 (care about the tech:want fast gains). Almost every post now is about the price (and now even I've started to speculate, which I never did before).
It changed a few weeks ago when it started to gain a lot, before that I reckon that 70/30 split was flipped. A lot of people really excited and talking about the Stellar project. It's a shame but isn't it the same when anything goes (relatively) mainstream.

Look at Stellar.  or This is the kind of crypto that will change the world. All credit to BTC in making me a good bit of $ but it was the first model and it won't be the last.
While 'crypto is having an identity crisis' there are solid, super fast, and reliable cryptos that won't go down with the ship but instead sky rocket.

[original post]( from r/stellar. 
• **Lumens vs. Bitcoin:** Jed McCaleb spoke at Distributed Markets in 2017 about the advantages, but more importantly, the disadvantages of Bitcoin. Listen to the talk [here]( Jed said, “Bitcoin is this awesome innovation. The first thing it does is converts a real world resource, electricity, into a digital asset. So it takes something from the real world and puts it into the digital realm. The second thing it does is provides immutable public record. It’s basically a database that everyone can see but no one change arbitrarily… That’s great, Bitcoin solves the double spin problem [ of proving possession and transmitting volume]… [However, to fix the problems of bitcoin] you might think well maybe we’ll just kind of keep adding [software] to Bitcoin until we get there, but that’s not really the way software works. You want to have the design from the beginning and solve these simple issues. Bitcoin was designed to be a new currency, **it wasn’t really designed to be this unifying universal payment network. So that’s what Stellar does**. It solves these three remaining issues.”  
• **Lumens vs. Bitcoin  According to [wired.com]( "Bitcoin mining guzzles energy - and it's carbon footprint just keeps growing." Wired says "Today, **each bitcoin transaction requires the same amount of energy used to power nine homes in the US for one day**... The total energy use of this web of hardware is huge—an estimated 31 terawatt-hours per year. More than 150 individual countries in the world consume less energy annually. And that power-hungry network is currently increasing its energy use every day by about 450 gigawatt-hours, roughly the same amount of electricity the entire country of Haiti uses in a year." Because Stellar is based on a consensus algorithm rather than mining, it takes much less energy to run the Stellar network. The Poseidon Foundation decided to build their platform on Stellar rather than Ethereum or Bitcoin because of this [(twitter source)](
• **Lumens ICO tokens vs. Ethereum ICO tokens:** According to [Stellar.org]( "traditionally, ICO tokens have been issued on the Ethereum network in the form of ERC20 tokens. ERC20 tokens are easy to issue and are infinitely customizable using Ethereum’s smart contracting language. However, recent events have highlighted and exacerbated some weaknesses of the network, including **slow transaction processing times** for the network during ICOs and **increasingly expensive gas prices** (by fiat standards) for transactions and smart contract execution. Moreover, many organizations require **only basic tokens**; they adopt the risk of Ethereum’s Turing complete programming language without taking advantage of many of its benefits."  
"While Ethereum has the most expressive programming capabilities, we believe Stellar is the best choice for ICOs that do not require complex smart contracts. Stellar’s primary goal is to facilitate issuing and trading tokens, especially those tied to legal commitments by known organizations, such as claims on real-world assets or fiat currency."  
• **Stellar vs. Ethereum  The median transaction time on Stellar is 5 seconds, compared to approximately 3.5 minutes on Ethereum [(source)]( Stellar has a negligible transaction fee (.00001 XLM ~= $0.0000002) with no gas fee for computation, while depending on the complexity of the computation, the median cost for a transfer on the Ethereum network is $0.094. **Security:** While both Stellar and Ethereum run on a decentralized network, the Stellar network has fewer security pitfalls. Stellar uses atomic transactions comprised of simple, declarative operations while Ethereum uses turing complete programming capabilities which produces less auditable code and **greater risk of exploitable vulnerabilities** [(source)]( **Recently, a security flaw in the Ethereum network froze millions of dollars**. According to [Mobius ariticle]( written by David Gobaud, "On November 6, 2017, Github user deveps199 'accidentally' triggered a bug in Parity, a popular Ethereum mult-sig wallet, that froze more than $152 million in Ether across 151 addresses. The bug impacted several token sales including Polkadot, which has had ~$98 million out of its recent $145 million sale frozen."  
"Mobius had none of its ongoing pre-sale Ether frozen because **we do not trust Ethereum’s Smart Contract based multi-sig wallets given the vast Turing complete attack surface** and did not use one. Security broadly is one of the main reasons **the MOBI token that powers the DApp Store is a Stellar Protocol token** and not an Ethereum token."  
• **Lumens vs. Ripple:** According to [Wall Street Bitcoin Exchange]( "Many investors like to compare the company [Stellar] to Ripple, and there are a lot of similarities, being that some of the founders worked on the Ripple team. In what can now be looked at as another blockchain development drama that plays out on chat boards and in interviews all across the globe. Stellar declared they fixed Ripple’s problems with their hard fork, however, Ripple has failed to [admit to any of the flaws]( in its design that the Stellar team has pointed out." The article concludes by saying, "We Choose XLM Over XRP For 2018. That is why we are going with Stellar Lumens over Ripple in our portfolio for the rest of 2017 and 2018. After holding Ripple for a long time this year, it just never seems to make the big break like other names with bigger market caps like Bitcoin Cash, Dash, and Litecoin have. While we are holding on most all our larger market caps, we feel that Stellar Lumens will be one of the break out coins for 2018."

Where to begin?
Stellar is a FAR superior infrastructure to Bitcoin. I'm not saying that BTC isn't a good store of value for now, of course it is and I've been lucky enough to profit from that. As far as real world uses, Stellar beat everything hands down. I would say watch some of the interviews with Jeb (founder of Stellar, ex founder of Ripple, eDonkey, creator of Mt.Gox...) he wants to revolutionise the way in which the financial system works.
I would watch this:

Read the comments from the judge and the prosecution after the trial if you want to be more angered. The judge called it incredibly harsh and the prosecution said more or less the same.

If you're going to experiment it's better to learn those lessons with a small amount like you did. BTC or whatever other crypto you have is worth a lot more if you hold on. I think the right attitude to take is an investment in a future technology that will make the world a better place rather than a get rich quick scheme.
