who knows. possibly one or more of the following...
1. easier to use. so easy a tech unsavvy grandma could use it.
2. more public awareness. So common that its in music and movies and not just some tech cred accouterment.
3. better public perception. currently tied to hackers, nerds, extremist libertarians and criminals. not saying any of that is bad but it is polarizing. 
EDIT: to answer your comment... the early days of reddit it crashed quite often. It still does from time to time. Next time it will take a bigger blow to knock down the server. wash, rinse, repeat.

BTC / 21,000,000 = V (value)
over time, V gets larger (or smaller). When you sub-divide the BTC, you are really sub-dividing V.
@_date: 2015-06-12 02:42:07
yes. 
1. Not digging whats going on at reddit at the moment, but I still love it. 
2. I believe reddit should get some competition so it can try to attract and keep users by providing better service. I would not want reddit to go the way of Digg.
3. Hey Voat accepts bitcoin. Let me tell other people who are into bitcoin. Maybe they might share my view.
4. With more funding it might even be possible for Voat to get a better services.
EDIT: whenever voat goes back online they do have their own bitcoin sub thats been around for 11 or so months. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 04:30:13
reddit sorta kinda has bitcoin. But one interesting part of voat was that supposedly it will pay for content. not sure how since I didn't really read further into it.
edit: here. its not exactly worked out. hopefully this policy will make it to beta and further...


We are still working out the details of this process and we are open for suggestions. So far the following is being discussed:










I kinda imagine if this model takes off, reddit and other sites might follow suit for user participation.

Supposedly it has been audited by Antonopoulos. How can it be a huge threat if you are unsure what their purpose is?
I thought their purpose was pretty clear... they want to control the flow so they can make money on the spread going both ways. Not only that but they can sell (anonymous) metrics data which is in itself,at least IMO, more valuable (potentially) than the money they can make on the spread.
EDIT: added anonymous.

For all those downvoting, I would like to know why. From what I gather from the article, shady individuals with are creating questionable investment vehicles... and now they are accepting bitcoins and you should stay away.
I subscribe to security analysis to get some more understanding to securities trading. For the most part its over my head, like this post.

We are going to do some more in depth training. Some issues need to be resolved.

Bitcoin has value because people assign it value and exchange it for goods and services... hoarding it helps keep value but I dont believe hoarding at this early stage is good. why the hell are you responding to a month old comment? LOL

If the bitcoin ecosystem was larger, then it can compete directly with credit card companies. Now it doesn't stand a chance without our help as a community.

first of all, you are completely exaggerating. Typical swipe fees range from 2.5-3%. Secondly, it can be argued that it is against the law to take a different amount per transaction (some states do not allow for surcharge fees, where a merchant can charge a different amount for credit card purchases). 
Also, it costs companies to integrate and train for bitcoin integration. And 1-2% savings is not huge. If you spend $10k, it equates to just $100-$200. 
And you are not considering the fact that if there is no competition they can charge whatever they want. If there were more competition in the bitcoin market place then people would fight for the consumer. If you don't reward early adopting merchants, then they will leave and guess what.... credit cards and cash has not failed them before. 
The attitude you have right now as an early adopter is not helping bitcoin for the future.

They can sell anonymous user metrics, like google and facebook without  disclosing personal information.
With metrics, individual identities are not that important. You are not marketing to individuals. You are marketing to groups. Individuals come and go all the time, trends transcend the individual.
"Information attached to actual people is far more valuable" Sure, but not really.
"Especially to people who like to control other people" This sounds overly paranoid. I'm not sure coinbase wants to "control" you. I don't think facebook or google want to do that either.

People who have a lot of bitcoins from early mining should consider giving some to family and friends. Introduce them to the blockchain wallet and gyft.com (website, their app does not take bitcorns) on their phone. Show them how relatively simple it is to do day to day things with bitcoin.

at 1:00 he says that the gov abolished the system that tied the dollar to resources. Actually, before that time, technically, it was not fiat.

Reddit is going to die the same death as digg did. Its happening now. Too many people late in the game are completely muddying up what reddit was which was a social news aggregator.

This is late but AC Clarke did not invent the Communications satellite.
He predicted it and wrote a concept for it before it as created...however, the concept itself made way before him. The first telecom satellite was invented and deployed by NASA, a government agency.
Clarke contributed to the popularity of the idea that geostationary satellites would be ideal telecommunications relays. He first described this in a letter to the editor of Wireless World in February 1945[80] and elaborated on this concept in a paper titled Extra-Terrestrial Relays – Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?, published in Wireless World in October 1945.[81] The geostationary orbit is now sometimes known as the Clarke Orbit or the Clarke Belt in his honour.[82][83]
It is not clear that this article was actually the inspiration for the modern telecommunications satellite. According to John R. Pierce, of Bell Labs, who was involved in the Echo satellite and Telstar projects, he gave a talk upon the subject in 1954 (published in 1955), using ideas that were "in the air", but was not aware of Clarke's article at the time.[84] In an interview given shortly before his death, Clarke was asked whether he'd ever suspected that one day communications satellites would become so important; he replied
I'm often asked why I didn't try to patent the idea of communications satellites. My answer is always, "A patent is really a license to be sued."[85]
Though different from Clarke's idea of telecom relay, the idea of communicating with satellites in geostationary orbit itself had been described earlier. For example, the concept of geostationary satellites was described in Hermann Oberth's 1923 book Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen (The Rocket into Interplanetary Space) and then the idea of radio communication with those satellites in Herman Potočnik's (written under the pseudonym Hermann Noordung) 1928 book Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums — der Raketen-Motor (The Problem of Space Travel — The Rocket Motor), sections: Providing for Long Distance Communications and Safety[b] and (possibly referring to the idea of relaying messages via satellite, but not that 3 would be optimal) Observing and Researching the Earth's Surface published in Berlin.[86][c] Clarke acknowledged the earlier concept in his book Profiles of the Future.[87]

not sure why you are downvoted, seems very plausible.
It can be argued that the governments of the world lost control to banks and corporations and bitcoin can be their great equalizer... if it succeeds.
Also, if bitcoin becomes the dominant currency, there would be no better way to measure the economy. It can still be pseudonymous but it can still be measured where now its an insane guesstimate.

OMG this: from their site, BUT I am really skeptical about this company since they can't spell SUFFICIENT!!! I am a strong believer in the community supporting bitcoin adopting companies as much as possible but this tactic to me is simply ridiculous. I do like their message except that crappy bullshit last paragraph. 
"App.net frequently gets requests to add Bitcoin as a payment option for our premium-tier accounts. We have been open to the idea, but have been concerned that very few people would actually choose to use Bitcoin as a payment mechanism. Bitcoin clearly has value, but if it is primarily used for speculation rather than for buying goods and services, it may be best for service providers like ourselves to wait for the market to develop.
It may seem easy for a retailer to start accepting Bitcoin, but a company must consider the technical, legal, accounting and support complexity introduced by making this move.
Rather than take a guess about whether it would be worth supporting Bitcoin or not, we decided to run a simple test. We came up with a minimum amount of revenue we would want to see in order to permanently support Bitcoin as a payment option, and if there is **sufficent** market demand then we will do so."

Facebooks goal is to grow in relevance and maintain its relevance. Its buying the market of communication one company at a time.
Also, if you have ever worked in web development or marketing it would make more sense. If you look at it in these terms, facebook has a ton of user demographic data. Every site you visit that has a like is an iframe connected to facebook that tells x user visited y site.
But more like x user is of profile 1 and frequents site y. given this info times millions... facebook can make a very good projection of trends, and current state of the market which is very valuable anonymous data to organizations. So facebook wants to grow its scope of information. Given enough information facebook can predict trends more closely. Google is doing the same thing and is pushing google + because it wants more of the granular demographic data to associate with search and browsing.
So, given that its a race for who has more relevant and more accurate data, 16 billion dollars is an investment for the future... an investment for survival.

Yes mt red failed but why is ghash not charging fees? Bitcoin is about decentralized currency that does not need trust of others. Now we put our faith on ghash to do the right thing?

 I am familiar with the Kardashev scale but, wow, never considered this. People here are too fixated with the word "government". Look at all the forms of organization from cells, to cultures, to countries... they are just increasing levels of organization and complexity, like a fractal.
Bitcoin does offer a way to unify the current systems we have now to create a greater whole. Call it a "government", a "collective" (watch the Randists obsessive over this word) or a type 1... it will be a form of organization.

Thanks but it will help a lot more if the holders of bitcoins help by spending it more. I know spending can bring the price down but it will help bring more attention
I used to be anti coinbase but not anymore (Their site was down when I needed funds and they took a while to confirm a payment). What coinbase is doing is helping make bitcoin simpler and easier to use. We need more of that.
We need bitcoin integrated into super markets and gas stations. We need more people using it. I for one dont like that bitcoin is mostly thought of as an asset. 
I am a developer but unfortunately I do not have that much time to work on building the things that can bring more mass appeal to bitcoin. With tigerdirect I think I've done as much as I can.... maybe not but it feels that way. Now its up to developers and holders to do more.
Anyway.... viva la bitcoin

Cool! Keep it coming. If other businesses see that TigerDirect is doing well with bitcoin sales. It will lure other retailers into the space. When more companies start competing, then the prices will start coming down again. 
Right now, other companies are watching. If TigerDirect shows mediocre results, then they might think it isn't worthwhile.
Bitcoin needs 
1. More business that will make bitcoin more useful.
2. Easier methods of use, which will bring in mass adoption.
App makers, wallet makers, payment processors need to take notes from Apple. They made everything "stupid easy",   and a majority of people are not intimidated by their hardware and software.
Also, those with tons of coins, give some to family and friends. I've converted a dozen people to bitcoin with this method.

Just to keep it sjort. I say it's not compatible with the real world because her heroes are all strong willed and that a society that champions only that type of personally cannot possibly sustain. Objectivism, I guess, like many trains of thought, have been misused but objectivism more so since it justifies self over others.

No coinbase is the issue here when they can take up to 24 hours to send a payment? That's ridiculous. I've sent payments through qt and blockchain and confirmation is within that 15 minute window. Coinbase is forcing people to use only their system. Coinbase is not bitcoin.

if there are enough of them or they are buying and hodling a shit ton which, doesn't seem to be the case.
some people in believe that bitcoin is not going up because either of these scenarios is happening:
1. The whales are not buying because they are bidding on the SR coins.
2. QE is ending and the dollar is just gaining strength again and you can see the correlation with gold and oil prices which is usually tied to the strength of the dollar.

Well, you're right. However, being a amazon affiliate is a conflict of interest for me.
This is how I got the link. I went to amazon, I searched for "what the dormouse said", I clicked on the link to the book and I copied that link. It should be the same. I'll do it now.
I get this:
Im thinking the qid is some sort of session tracker. 
I went here to see how affiliates get credit and the parameter "TAG" has to be in the URL
notice, my link does not have that parameter so nobody gets credit from any sale of the book. I just wanted to share the book with people, I'm surprised people accuse me of trying to profit (not that there is anything wrong with that in "capitalism"), but nobody gets money here from any sale except amazon.

Unfortunately, it was difficult to get a hold of other suppliers and it was the easiest to offer to those new to mining. 
That's all I can say since I am not the official voice for tigerdirect. This is my personal account. I have just been an active proponent for it and it was not easy (took 8 months convincing many detractors in several departments, my boss was a key supporter so it helped.). If anyone wants to ask me questions on my approach if they are planning to pitch it to their company let me know.

Of course apple knows this. Apple has their own agenda. For how much people criticize them, they are a very successful business and they usually make rational decisions. 
Why is Apple not taking bitcoin? Maybe they don't think its worth their while... yet. When Apple comes around on things they said they won't do.... (video on ipod, nfc, front facing camera on phone) when they do, the technology has advanced, its cheaper and its proven and they typically have been researching and have created a good interface for it.

the napster metaphor works. Napster was superseded by bittorrent and then pandora / spotify / itunes. Pandora and spotify were happy mediums between consumer and content producer.
People have learned much since the initial launch of bitcoin and possibly a newer technology that is built upon the strengths of bitcoin without its weaknesses can potentially supersede bitcoin later on.
"But it could also go the way of Napster, the trailblazing music-sharing system that pioneered a new category, but was superseded by superior implementations that overcame its technical and commercial flaws."

Not sure if that is a good analogy. Because, the brakes werent working or the engine stalls during high speed or the power steering fails. Not necessarily drivers fault and could be fault of design or production.
Maybe a better analogy is that cars need wheels to be changed often and gox ignored this detail and heir tires blew up and caused them to crash? Tires wearing and possibly disintegrating is a known issue but most mitigate this problem with proper maintenance and care? 
I am just building on your analogy and not really sure if this applies to what happened.

You can also consider that buying that amount of BTC privately, even above market, won't move the market. BUT, buying that amount of bitcoin on the open market can move the market up.

I agree with you but it was a hard sell at first to get tiger to accept bitcoin. I chose a bad time. April, march the big very public crash happened and then Silk Road made it look bad. 
I bet it is still a hard sell now given the perceived diffuculty in infrastructure adoption. Bitpay was wonderful and it was quick. Perception was the hard push. Right now let the early ones reap the rewards... As others enter the space competition will drive the price down like it always has. My two cents

Hi, I work for tigerdirect but this is my personal account.
Can you pm your order number and blockchain verification to I know who he is and I will make sure your situation is straightened out. I can't/shouldn't do it from my account because this account is, well, not official.
I promise to help you out... I work at corporate and I was one of the people responsible for tigerdirect accepting bitcoin. As for hiring people, the bitcoin community is very small and most if not all are highly skilled individuals that most likely will not take a CS job. Training is an issue and we are still working on it. Bitcoin is not exactly laymen friendly yet. We really need to address the customer service issues and we have been working on it. We have much more work to do.
The problem sounds bitpay related because if our system did not get a payment confirmation it will not ship. I will personally look into your problem tomorrow.

**DONT CLICK AND GIVE THIS TABLOID GARBAGE AD REVENUE!!!! Article here:**
TLDR: assumptions, loose logical connections, sensationalist horse shit.
What’s the key to the perfect pump-and-dump Ponzi scheme? 
Plausibility and prey.
Meet the new wolf of Wall Street: bitcoin, the anonymous computer “Tinkertoy crypto-currency,” as we dubbed it in a year-end column.
And now the crypto-currency has toppled, with bitcoin values cut in half in the last week, if you can even get your “money” back.
Ponzi-type scams have been around since the 1920s. The greed and dishonesty never change; the techniques just keep evolving. Wolves like to eat.
For sure, they are harder to spot these days than the one in Martin Scorsese’s Oscar-nominated film “The Wolf of Wall Street.”
Long gone are the silk-suited in-your-face wise guys, waving bottles of Dom Perignon around and snorting coke off the bodies of prostitutes at parties.
Today’s wolves are much greedier and much more sophisticated. They are faceless, anonymous cyber-criminals. Bitcoin was their tool, their penny stock, their empty shell company. In the fall of 2011, bitcoin was at $2. By November 2013 it had risen to more than $1,000!
If that’s a currency, those bitcoinians must be some productive citizens.
Today it stands at $350. All is not well: Bitcoin, the anarchist currency used by drug dealers and other illicit sorts, has fallen into, um, bits and pieces.
I truly feel bad for the innocent people who got conned into investing in the bitcoin shell game, but fortunately there really were not that many widows and orphans who got taken here. Mostly it was some of the people who thought they were “the smartest guys in the room.”
Today, many of the largest bitcoin exchanges located around the world claim they have been under “cyberattack” and have halted redemptions, including Japan’s Mt Gox, the third-largest “exchange.”
As a digital delivery system, perhaps bitcoin can be saved. But a currency built by hackers and anonymous code-writing anarchists offers a pretty weak alternative to cash, credit cards or PayPal.
But if you saw the movie, you know that “wolves” lure the unwary in, let them feed and grow comfortable for a while — and then the wolves pounce.
Welcome to the 21st-century Ponzi scheme.

Bitcoin has a long way to go and I sometimes I think the community is not helping.
1. Bitcoin has to get easier to use, much easier.
2. Bitcoin has to be much more useful, that means more merchants taking it.
3. All this shooting iphones, and making fun of mtgox CEO, and all these other crazy stunts have got to stop. IMO it scares away others and makes bitcoin seem like a circus.
4. The hoarding mentality has got to stop. We have to invest in the currency by circulating it. 
I have said these before and, to my surprise, it isn't a very popular view point.

"Homogenize with idiots" I am not sure you are using homogenize correctly. Do you mean, merge with idoits? The bitcoin community turns into idiots? Become an amalgam with idoits? Homogenize means to become uniform.
I think the bitcoin community has a very vocal extremist minority, which IMO, is scaring off people instead of helping the community grow.

Well, customer service on free services is a pain. From what I've worked on where I work, customer service is a mountain of issues.
From customers who can make small problems large and from very bad customer service reps who can turn a small issue into an impossible one. Also, not sure how it can work for bitcoin billionaire where people can win coins. The house has to win at least 51% of the time to make it worthwhile for the developers... and for a "strategy game" I don't know how that could work (I put it in qoutes because it seems to be, on face value, cookie clicker+). Then again there are probably ways to make it work. I just don't know how I would do it.

What is the point of ghash being attractive if the value of bitcoin were to crash? Nothing.

thats not how trading works. Given the relative small volume of bitcoin, you can move the market slightly with 1K coins probably. If you were trading apple stock, 30K shares at 66 million share volume per day... you probably won't move the stock price half a penny.

I did mention this several months ago but people still downvoted me. Oh well. Given your points there are still easy ways of obfuscation. You can have bitcoin tumbling groups and/or services where you can "wash" your bitcoins. Since you can have an infinite amount of wallets you can still make new purchases pseudonymously. But at the end of the day, you give up every account you use when you ship it to your address, no matter what payment method you use. :/
Compared to credit cards, I believe it gives more privacy though. I think there is only one way to go about it with cards and thats by buying gift cards.

I think returns is a major issue with all bitcoin purchases. People can and will abuse returns and use it as a price hedge while holding onto a goods. But I think the only way is to return USD equivalent. It would be great if a company would pop up to cover price fluctuation insurance. 
IMO, this is a growing pain that will disappear once BTC has a larger user base and price stabilizes. When that is, I dont know... if ever. I hope it does though.

At one point I liked Krugman, he seemed to make sense. He leaned left like I did. But later, I noticed how biased and condescending he was and how way too emotional he was to be some academic economist.

Atlas Shrugged was terrible. Why? Characters were flat... not even full characters... tehy were caricatures. Story was way too drawn out. Way way way too many monologues. I think fountainhead was fairly good.
Not really a big fan of greed as a virtue and I feel her dismissiveness and outright hatred of eastern philosophy was not warranted. Sun Tzu and Lao Tsu had great insights into humanity.

I read her work. Anthem, Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and the virtues of selfishness. I don't like her ideas. I find them fairly incompatible with how society works. I don't believe in her virtues of selfishness.... I don't like how she justifies rape because of a mans personal wants (Fountain head). I don't think society can work with just type A personalities.
Atlas Shrugged was just horrendously written. Her protagonists were too perfect... Nietzsches supermen. Where the antagonists were pathetic idiots. Lets face it, her main characters destroyed the world to help it... a true act of selflessness.
Her philosophy is incomplete in the sense that it is not compatible with the world and it never will be. Because, IMO, it cannot scale because it is so inflexible. It is rigid and can only exist in pockets and it cannot sustain itself for long. These are my opinions and its been over 15 years since I've read her books. Her views did complete my sense of the world and expand my understanding of different philosophies. I did read more about other phlosophies, especially the ones she was against and I opened up myself to a wider world. Her philosophy closes out other ways of thinking.... I guess thats why many of her proponents are militantly close minded.

I disagree. Not everyone is into porn. But lets just say its true for the sake of argument... It still turns away women. Also, socially conservative men, if they did like porn, will usually do in private. It will be hard to associate publicly for them individually, let alone their business.
For example, how do you think a company like amazon, can back bitcoin when it is associated with objectifying women? These factors can contribute to slowing down adoption. PLease note, I am trying to keep it on topic.

There are ways to maintain some semblance of privacy with bitcoin... maybe services will come about that can make it more easy to do so. But the positive implication of a public ledger is huge.
1. Transparency in spending. We will know where our taxes go and our donations go.
2. We can make near 100% analysis of trade.
3. We can analyze our economy better and possibly see where the deficiencies lie and where things are booming.
From a high level we can demystify economics.

The benefit is that the only way to get those products and services is with bitcoin. Think of it in terms of countries... The ONLY way you can buy from foreign companies directly is to exchange your currency for theirs. 
The reason the US dollar is so powerful is because there is a lot of demand for US goods and services. Bitcoin needs the same of this.

Stop thinking about bitcoin as some thing that behaves on its own.
Bitcoin behaves the way it does because of us. Because of society. Because of the markets. 
Right now we, meaning the people here, are deluded as fuck. Circle jerking each other. Giving high fives. Fantasizing about the wealth they will have in the future. Hoarding... fishing for tips... but not really doing much to help bitcoin grow. Seriously, some of you clowns behave like shameless pan handlers. (like that dude with his phone and QR code at the Cleavlander)
Right now bitcoin is just sitting there and its just a curiosity thats quickly getting boring in the eyes of the majority of people out there. The markets are hating it because it is not currently a good investment. It has a lot more utility than before but it just isn't going anywhere. It still isn't that useful yet. The only thing that can make it more useful is us.
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:36:16
Your buy in won't do shit for bitcoin.
I think what will help bitcoin is a dedicated workforce that is willing to work ONLY for bitcoin, coupled with businesses and suppliers that will ONLY accept bitcoin. So basically a closed ecosystem of only bitcoin so that prices are not dependent on fiat. Without this, bitcoin will always be pegged to the dollar. 
So basically, energy companies, transportation companies, goods suppliers, service companies, and workers to fill the roles necessary.

Well, lets just say Satoshi at some point becomes a bad person / entity. He / she  / they can threaten the whole bitcoin economy if he decides to give away or sell his bitcoins all at once for cheap. 
Lets just say he sells it for cheap, that can drop the "value" of bitcoins down vs fiats. Lets say fiats are totally destroyed and bitcoin becomes the global currency...  he / she / they dump the coins to the masses... well, that action could potentially drop the "exchange value" of current coins in circulation.... or not.
Yes, it can only be done once but the threat of it can be used multiple times.

Imagine if for the past year or two you have been mining and preaching about bitcoin all the while being ridiculed. People tell you to sell but you hold to your convictions. You have doubts as the value seems to be questionable... Mining gets harder. Electricity gets more expensive and your girlfriend / wife ridicules you. You amass a massive amount of these worthless coins... The suddenly rich. You were right all along. You want to laugh at all those people who made fun of you. You want to buy a luxury car and do donuts in front of their house... Then you crash it into a tree and you get out and jump into another luxury car... So yeah money can turn you into an asshole, especially when you have to deal with so much crap.

Privacy is a myth, I agree. What I meant by equilibrium is that a middle would always be reached, for a time, until the extremes are re-calibrated. Right now its between "freedom" and "slavery". "privacy" vs "transparency". "free will" and "fate"

I may have some great news to post soon...well, hopefully soon. I can't say anything right now though but, I posted before that I proposed using bitcoin for my company and it looks like it may just happen using bitpay. Integration, testing, legal takes time though.
Bitpay is just awesome. Less fees than credit cards and faster fund transfers. It's a win win.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:57:30
Its a bit risky for my taste, maybe I will look into it and try a test transaction. It doesn't seem like a proper verification process.

Helping people start wallets is a good idea. There has to be a better way to seed capital to the masses without "charity". I just can't answer that question right now. I think bitcoin is too intimidating for the non-technical user. Maybe, somehow bridging that will help increase adoption also.

@_date: 2013-11-24 20:49:17
You have to look at things in context. 
You won't see those now because of the current value. You have to zoom in.
Anyway, you will learn... on your own. You obviously have perfect 20/20 hindsight. Let's see how your foresight works.
Edit: Sorry I may have over-reacted. I have huge debates with people who have little experience in investing and only care about how rich they are getting, all the while not really contributing to bitcoin except create bubbles and mass hysteria as it pops. To answer your question, I am not sure where you can see those. I rode a couple of them real time so I had first hand experience. It would be nice to have one like they have in Google finance.
@_date: 2013-09-09 01:02:20
Yes, but your entry points are usually the same. You can argue Tor but there is no Tor bitcoin clients... at least not that I know of... Once entry points are compromised, if not already... then it doesn't matter how many wallets you have or whether or not you are using Tor.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:59:27
You are probably right that it isn't relevant. But bitcoin can be the catalyst for a "drastic redistribution of wealth". The first step is to get this economy going though.

@_date: 2013-10-21 15:16:58
Well I understand that there is a balance but I am the buyer not the seller. In order for the bitcoin economy to grow, buyers have to be comfortable and exchanges should have some sort of guarantee.
Maybe what I am looking for is a trusted escrow service of sorts. Scottrade has my social security number but I didn't have to send them my drivers license. And scottrade is a huge company with many clients and is based in the US and I am protected as a consumer.
MtGox is a much smaller company based in Japan. So it is not within my comfort level to give them sensitive info. Dwolla is also too small too. WIth large comapnies like Adobe getting hacked, I feel that smaller companies have much less resources to protect themselves.

Scottrade. I did give them social security but I didnt have to send them a picture ID. Too me thats just too much. 
I am not familiar with buying bitcoins and I am glad for all these responses. Its helping me understand what I really want and what I should expect. I guess what I am really looking for is fast, secure and. Cheap and private would be a bonus.

Hey thanks man... yeah I was going through some of the products... I was looking into local stuff only. Is there a scoring system like ebay? Wish it was more safe, these kinds scare people away from bitcoin.
It would be great if there was some sort of third party funds release system where funds go into it and can be released upon delivery or delivery confirmation.
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:30:53
Of course we care about what it's valued. I care too since it benefits me a lot. But I understand that what benefits me now is not necessarily beneficial for bitcoin later.
your example of goods, services and utilities... how would they be priced if bitcoins continue to rise? Lets just say that the price is adjusted to some adjusted perceived value... then it encourages people to pay later. Lets just say that it is fixed... then things just get more and more expensive over time? 
Bitcoin needs a lot more infrastructure set in place. From the top of my head...
1. I think it needs a credit building (cor business as a consumer protection) system where good credit can be  attached to your wallet address. I say this because there is no charge backs and ultimately gives power to the seller.
2. It needs an escrow service to protect both buyer and seller.
Fiat currencies have evolved over hundreds of years... bitcoin is new and I do believe it is the future but things have to be looked at rationally... not with some blind cult like religious fervor like some people express here.

Look at my "karma" I've been a redditor 4 years. I dont care about upvotes or downvotes. I only look at them to measure sentiment. If I cared then I would have shut up in the face of so much adversity.
I do agree with you about BTC being proper currency. I just think its moving way too fast right now which flies in the face of my immediate personal interests. Lots of tools need to be in place and we can borrow some of the innovations of fiat like credit, escrow, etc. 
"Besides, I'd like the BTC to be a proper currency, but it can't be one unless the circulating mass of bitcoins holds value large enough to allow some non-marginal percent of the internet to use it for trade. "
I think you have a valid point here. But all I am saying is that, it would help enormously if the bitcoin millionaires start making TONS of tranactions and start rewarding the fuck out of early bitcoin merchants. This will get the attention of many more merchants. Right now, hoarding it the name of the game.

@_date: 2013-11-23 02:34:01
That can be debated to no end. 
I think it depends on the environment. If we are amid a massive recession and we are suffering from shortages in every sector then we should save. If not we should grow as much as we can (sustainably). Do I have a model for that? No.
I won't say an economy is thriving if it is moving slowly (saving). I would say it's getting by. What you propose is a massive change in culture that is painful because a fast moving economy based on credit is supporting lots of jobs and lots of industries. There would be a ton of painful collapses. Is that good? Short term, no. Long term, that is debatable.
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:13:05
That makes no sense. I don't usually trust anyone at face value regardless of location. However, if this news came from Forbes, or WSJ or NYT then it would carry more weight.

Don't get me wrong. I agree with you. But it has to be a collective effort to make any real difference. Minor inconvenience is the enemy to every cause. Hardliners will always follow. Moderates will make an effort. But the vast majority are fickle.
Maybe I am among the fickle but unless there is any real way of getting victory it can seem like a hopeless cause. Specially if you take into consideration that many have to sacrifice family, career and life sometimes.

Unfortunately, you have people propping up prices. After all, all value comes from peoples perception.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:49:37
I am not sure about charity. I think it's a double edged sword. Giving away bitcoin can potentially ruin it's perceived value.
On the other hand, lending businesses POS systems for free to help support adoption is, in my opinion, a better way to help spread it.
I think the people using bitcoin as currency the most are people remitting BTC and small business and economies within countries with no real stable monetary infrastructure like African Coutries, Southeast Asian Countries and some Latin American Countries could benefit the most with bitcoin.

From my understanding, the problems being solved is associated with the public ledger so it is solving practical problems associated to bitcoin already.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:26:05
because products also appreciate and depreciate.

Well, there are economic instruments that help speed up and slow down the flow of currency now. I mean, I am a STRONG proponent for bitcoin and a part of me wants your graph to be right. But what is great for me might not me good for bitcoin itself.
I am not deciding what is a good flow of currency, I am just saying that the current system which has evolved over hundred+ years has created systems to control that flow. Bitcoin should have the same right? Right now, given your graph... nobody in their right mind will want to spend. Thats not currency thats a long term investment.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:33:06
Thank you! I have been trying to tell people that the best way to ensure the success of bitcoin is to spend it! no hoard it! But I get stupid ass statements like "I am helping bitcoin by helping find the right price" bullshit.
I feed on criticism, I think its the best way to grow and get stronger. I mean, someone is telling you your weaknesses for free! I'll take it. But no, people are so defensive of their world view and self interest that they forget that bitcoin needs an economy.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:23:52
inflation encourages people to spend though. Right now, people are reluctant to use bitcoin to buy because of the increasing value.
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:09:04
I think that pizza purchase helped make bitcoin what it is. People talk about that pizza all the time and it gets the word out about bitcoin.  If bitcoin ever hits $1m that pizza is part of history. I wouldn't be surprised if a cult starts around it. LOL The freaking Pizza of legend.

I think governmental integration would would bring more legitimacy and acceptance to bitcoin. I mean, if bitcoin integrates instead of being a disruption to large organizations like governments, we would have less push-back.
I am not acquainted with mixing services. Sounds like what zero-coin is trying to do with bitcoin.

I have some experience in proposing this.
0. Reach out to a company like bitpay and ask them what would be an easy way to integrate to your company. Then prepare your pitch.
1. Tell them its about PR. Lots and lots of free publicity. More publicity than the cheap corny ads they show on TV.
2. Tell them to go with a payment processor like bitpay, no risk to the dealership. They get dollars. It will be like paying with paypal. Risk vs Reward.... tons of reward, little risk.
3. Investment is very minimal and ROI is high (given integration is cheap and the free press is worth a lot). 
4. Talk to accounting and see how feasible it is. Make sure to prep people before pushing your pitch... get them to know about the technology first. It might be best to get others to support you before you pitch it to upper management. 
This is roughly the steps I took and I was fairly successful.

Wow, if Square adopts bitcoin it will be huge since a lot of small businesses already use square as a payment processor. Square can single-handedly  change the game very fast by bringing in so many merchants into bitcoin. Maybe we should tweet  and  to show them the demand!

@_date: 2013-11-23 22:48:09
I agree there are lots of issues.
1. We do need consumer protections. I wish I had the resources to do this but what we need is credit building systems where we can define trusted wallets through a credit building scheme. Sure they can transfer money to another wallet but that system should have in place a way to track the out flows of that money and flag those accounts too.
2. There needs to be more retailer adoption. Buying bitcoins to spend it is redundant but we do not those bitcoin hoarders to spend their coins and seed the economy with it. More people using bitcoins means faster global adoption, means more demand for bitcoins.
3. We need more escrow services to help with consumer and business protections. It's hard to write contracts when the paying party is exposed to more risk.
4. Bitcoin is anonymous but it is not private. If the purple dildo store is making bank, the feds know and can track it back to a wallet. Would suck if a company decided to do a background check. LOL, better start mining from different wallets now if you are a miner.
5. cumbersome. hell fuck yeah. Specially when coinbase app is booted from apple app store. 
6. Bubble? Maybe. What we need is bitcoin to stay at 800-900 ish for the foreseeable future.... maybe 10% rise YOY. This way we can start adjusting to it as consumers and merchants.
7. There is risk in everything. Those who risked the most in the nascent age of bitcoin will be the captains of industry in the future.

it is deflationary so yes.
Look at it this way, the value US money supply is on par with its GDP. The World GDP is $71 trillion. Current market cap of bitcoin is $8 billion at this price. If it became a world wide currency that represents 10% of the world economy (lets just say $8 trillion.) BIG IF yes, but if it did then the value of bitcoin has to rise by 1000 times. My math might be off.... Its late and Im drunk. LOL

You can create embargo's. You can embargo the funds of certain wallets flagging any other wallet from making transactions to and from an embargoed wallet right?

A valid point, If you didn't live paycheck to paycheck, yes. But that is not the point of currency.
The point of currency is to ease the method of transaction vs barter. With barter you need to find a person who needs a good that you can exchange for a good that you need. With currency, it solves that problem.
A currency (from Middle English curraunt, meaning in circulation) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation, as a medium of exchange, especially circulating paper money.

Didnt like how coinbase didnt ask me to verify my password on creation. LOL, I am picky about things like this for some reason but I am not ruling them out because of it.
I am not interested in selling my bitcoins. I actually want to get more. I really feel that it is the currency of the future. It adds visibility to the flow of currency and people may disagree but it also adds accountability (once its regulated). Cash could never really be tracked the same way.

I work for a fortune 1000 company and I have been struggling to get them to adopt bitpay. If bitcoin had mass appeal then the argument would be more in my favor. I really want bitcoin to succeed and I see it succeeding when people start spending it.


thats what algorithms are for. This might be true now, but in the future everything will be tracked. If you zoom out on noise a lot of times you see patterns. Just wait until quantum computers get into the scene. And we are on the same page with accountability. The mirror is not one way.


LOL, you can say the same for fiat. I mean, look at the euro. Whole countries are slaves to the European central bank. I think bitcoin will empower governments more and take the power away from the banks. I don't think the government is the enemy. We are the government. The enemy is the status quo.


I think a new form of capital controls would come into play. Since the government is essentially the largest entity (at least it should be) in a nation... it could heat up or cool down investment, hiring, etc. THis is far more direct in stimulating the economy or slowing it down vs QE and interesting rate adjustments which what the Fed reserve does,

Yes, I agree, but look how easy it is to track this progression of funds. 
employer (registered account with government) -&gt; employee (reported payment to a registered wallet).
All those transaction can easily be tracked and accounted for by the government. No need to verify receipts on payments with registered accounts. I believe for the cast majority of people, the simple model above applies.
As for unregistered accounts you still see how money flows, and given time, with the right amount of computing power and good algorithms, you can "watch" the flow of currency.
Plus look how the block chain is being monitored, even though huge transactions are anonymous. They are not secret. Everyone can see how fast currency moves.

"non-confiscatable"? Tell that to Silk road.
All I am saying is spend your bitcoins. Enrich the merchants taking the risk. Right now is the best time to do this. Treating it like an investment will slow the growth and acceptance of bitcoins and probably hurt it. What makes a currency valuable is what it can be exchanged for.

I think inflation=good is very rational. Why spend money more than you have to if it increases in value constantly?
Right now you are encouraged to spend or let the value of your money depreciate. If not spend, then find other means to preserve your wealth. Too many anecdotes to discuss... it will be a circular non-ending debate.

"In any P2P currency, there are only 3 choices, or combination of them.
You fund miners from savers.
You fund miners from spenders.
You let the government provide the mining. A public need so the economy doesn't stop."
So basically in the end, the government takes over hashing to maintain transaction security?

Bubbles happen when perceived value is much higher than "actual" value. You can't say that bubbles happen several times a day... bubbles are more a collective over-valuation and happen over an extended period.

Personally, I think bitcoin has the potential to stop or mitigate illegal activity. And help make society much more honest and efficient.
These, in my opinion are some benefits.
1. Ultimate accountability. Every transaction is public and you can basically follow the money. Goes for government too... we can watch where our tax bitcoins are going. 
2. Great for accounting. IRS would love this because, well, a real tax picture can be made by seeing how much individuals and corporations are making and spending. (granted that people register their bitcoin IDs or wallets)
3. Real time metrics. By being able to follow the money, you can have a real-time picture of what works and what doesn't.
4. Taking power away from banks and putting it back to the government. Just looking at Europe, poorer countries are subject to the ECB. By being able to see how the money flows, we can have a better way of seeing what is wrong economically and thus, repairing any blight.
5. Stopping terrorism. You would be able to see how terror networks can be funded. From primary, to secondary to tertiary sources. Bill buys gas from Shell which uses its coins to pay for land rights in Nigeria and you can follow the flow of coins to some official who pays off a local warlord to help him control problems who pays tribute to alqueda.

To go back to the topic, deflation is far worse than inflation. Deflation discourages money from flowing, because it causes hoarding. Inflation encourages investment and spending. I mean, this is basic economics. I don't have time to teach you this.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:59:32
How can your income stream possibly be bitcoin if people are hording it now?
They have to spend it. Its a catch 22-ish. you have to spend your bitcoins to make it more valuable.
Also to go back to your argument on taxes... guess what? Bitcoin will make it far easier for the government to audit you... to audit business... etc. Bitcoin is the ultimate means of accountability. The future is transparency.... sure you can still have anonymity but say good bye to privacy. 
Once / if bitcoin becomes mainstream businesses and people will probably have to register a wallet.

First of all setting prices. You have to create a system that tracks exchange rates. Second, then you have to worry about trading it to local currency so you can maintain your business (buying new inventory, paying operations costs). Saying that it is easy to integrate this in a large corporation is just showing lack of understanding of how business processes work. Bit pay easily integrates with everything with minimal change to current processes.

you are describing laissez faire economics. At least from what I have learned... laissez faire economies have a problem with adjusting to shocks... and unable to control bubbles. 
"ll the useless shit we see today will be secondary to education, projects that provide better quality of living, and more focus on services such as health."
There are way too many forward looking overly positive assertions in your argument. I am much more conservative in terms of where I see bitcoin and I think a conservative approach will sustain it.
"Needing to work less to maintain a comfortable lifestyle means people will have time to innovate, create and add to society on other fruitful ways rather than working 60 hour weeks in a shit job you hate, paying for a loan you'll only pay off in your 60's if you're lucky and having absolutely no other options."
I think this will happen with bitcoin, regardless. You are ultimately the one who controls your own destiny. bad decision = bad position.
"I simply do not buy into the current inflationary system BS." Right now, you are subject to it until bitcoin becomes mainstream. No way that can happen if people horde it.

Well, if you could use current technology with a small barrier to entry for current miners then it would be a win win.
Researchers can tap into the huge computing power of bitcoin miners and researchers can pay for computing time in bitcoin.
As an added bonus, the increase in difficulty could be slowed down and the payouts won't decrease for people like me who still can't touch 1/GHs (currently 700/MHs). There would be alternatives for me if mining  gets too competitive.

right... if you have the problem solved then please write a white paper and submit it to the bitcoin foundation.

Yeah I need to set that up. I am relatively new to this (a month), does a DDoS attack happen often to pools? Which pools do you recommend if you don't mind me asking?

No they are not selling cars. No this is not tesla. 
Private residence OFFERING to charge Model S cars for bitcoin... move alone, nothing to see here.

The Chinese have been looking and pushing for a worldwide dollar alternative because of the last financial crises. Bitcoin is their answer. The world currency they wanted just fell in their lap.
EDIT: getting downvoted even when citing the truth?

that is better but not the same as a press release. The great thing about press releases is that it gets picked up and reprinted by more established news organizations. Even though it really adds no real value to the news, it adds perceived value.
Thanks, I can use the twitter feed.

In all fairness, I thought the same back then when I used to listen to diggnation and TWIT.

not saying its built in. I am saying that a known flagged wallet can be flagged as illegal to do business with. We are essentially making the same argument here with your lists. 
I am a proponent of bitcoin just like you are. I think it is the currency of the future. If not bitcoin then something like it. I just see the details a bit differently.
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:45:07
I actually want the bitcoin to crash a bit, shake out the speculators and slowly climb up into something more significant. It's just way too hot right now. Its not growing naturally. I feel like speculators are doing a pump and dump.

I'm talking about now, as a way for businesses to easily integrate bitcoin. It's mostly painless. Integrating bitcoin directly is hard. Setting prices accordingly is just too much work.

Well, I have no idea what they are planning. They are the ones proposing an alternative world currency.
I assume the bonds mean nothing if the dollar falls apart. Plus, most of the worlds oil now is traded in dollars... which many countries just hate because they have to purchases USD to purchase oil and that gives the US a huge amount of leverage. Maybe lifting that leverage is worth losing trillions in bonds? Not my call.

what creates inflation is over saturation and or low demand of money.

The only reason I am asking these questions is that I want bitcoin to go mainstream (relatively quickly) and in order to do this, certain consumer protections, ease of use need to be addressed. The public wants fast, simple safe, and cheap. Bitcoin is fast and its cheap but it is far from simple and safe.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:27:31
I have to agree with him. This graph is meaningless. The ultimate success of bitcoin is it's use as an actual currency. This increasing value discourages it's use as actual currency because instead of spending it... people are encouraged to horde.

I stopped reading Gizmodo because of Jesus Diaz. This popped up on flipboard for me. I decided to post here like this so that they dont get page views.

I wish I could at the moment. Maybe I will, hopefully nobody beats me to it. 
Only reason I post any of my ideas here is because I can't execute quick enough and I would rather give it away. If its an idea I can do myself or with friends and can execute quickly and easily, trust me... I will not post it. :)

Dude, I have been trying to convince my company (retailer whose main competition is newegg) to adopt bitcoin with bitpay since April. I even got Anthony Gallippi to come and meet with my Chief execs... It was great at first then silk road hit the news and it was over. Not sure what the fuck happened. I am so frustrated. 
EDIT: May not April (proof) 
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:37:34
Maybe thats the problem, maybe bitcoin shouldn't be an investment. Maybe it should just be used for exchange and thats all.

true, but it is a loaded time reference.

Using dollars like currency is stupid? Its the only currency right now in the US.
" the most profitable thing you can do with your Benjamins is invest them in bitcoins" this is opinion. With hindsight yes. Will it be true in the future? who know. I have bitcoins so it is in my best interest for it to go up but it is also in my best interest for bitcoin to be used as ACTUAL currency not an investment vehicle.
"A currency (from Middle English curraunt, meaning in circulation) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation, as a medium of exchange"
Why is it stupid to use dollars as currency? How am I supposed to by gas, food, clothes, etc?
How can bitcoin be a currency if people are using it as an investment vehicle for the most part?
inflation plays a part in consumption. It plays an even bigger part in conspicuous consumption. Right now, people who hold bitcoin for the most part have other means of getting by. Joe Taxi driver isn't using bitcoin (at the moment) to get by day to day. That is what I really want.
"The current bubble" I am not sure what is happening now is a bubble or not. It could be. I sure hope not. The current bubble can actually slow the transition.
