I hope you are joking, seriously did you forget how bitcoin started? Did you forget all the "bitcoin, magic internet money" ads created to get people in this sub? Do you forget that is a big joke itself full of deluded people?  
As I said, I own both bitcoin and dogecoin, and your comment about "just another altcoin being pumped" is a serious joke man, BITCOIN is and was being pumped so hard that it caused november´s bubble and you have what? A weak coin that went from having 15b in market cap to 5.6b in just a couple of months. I rather own nowdays a bunch of dogecoin than a bunch of bitcoin, dogecoin is getting nothing but good news , publicity, and overall an awesome community while you have bitcoin having a bunch of scams, people losing money , no trust and I could go on and on, but yet you are making fun of dogecoin . Well then you are either new to bitcoin or you forgot how it all started. Bashing another community is pointless, thats all my comment was meant to say, sure dogecoin started as a big joke but now it is far from being one, check the market cap growth and 24h volume, more people move money in dogecoin than litecoin, peercoin and a bunch of people from bitcoin leave this sad community and join theirs. You people here seem to also forget that the innovation in cryptos is the blockchain NOT BITCOIN. So please, your poor analysis makes me laugh.

Not really, actually like the exchanges they make money out of fees , the price is really not as important as you think it is. All those services mentioned above earn money each time someone does a transaction, the prce could be 50 and they would still be making money out of fees, dont confuse things.
@_date: 2014-04-02 16:33:38
I laughed good 40 seconds after reading this comment , not sure why 
@_date: 2014-02-12 10:33:39
Kraken is the fastest verification  you will get imo if you dont like virwox and its fees.
@_date: 2014-04-01 23:50:08
If you just have $35 dollars to invest I would recommend using them to buy full altcoins, probably litecoin or dogecoin have more chance to rise a lot in value than bitcoin at this point.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:37:25
If you look deep in this sub or if you go to any serious BTC website you will notice that MTGox is crashing. Myself and a ton of people have been warning about this exchange for months. They were manipulating the market, faking transactions, inducing lag during btc crashes to stay safe but now they have gone too far. As its been said, once a few big BTC players decided to get out of MTgox it was going to crash (they have not enough money -fiat- to back all the BTCs they claim they have) so now they are in debt, they are facing a ton of lawsuits and every customer is trying to leave them, causing a chain reaction. 
My advice for you is to contact a lawyer and join one of the big class action lawsuits that are being prepared, if it is worth the money you have invested. If you have under $2000 you will probably get them back, if you have more than that you will have to sue or forget about it.
Also , considering this exchange crashing will be a big scandal for Bitcoin, a crash in price is to be expected soon, I have already sold everything and am just waiting to see what the bottom this time is. Good luck

and then again, android doesnt even account for 0.05% of the Linux  desktop market share. Android MOBILE is indeed mainstream but that doesnt mean Linux/Desktop is mainstream which was the whole point of my comparisson, you clearly dont get it and keep going with it. You are talking about another market.....you know that right?  Go ahead and throw that claim that "LINUX IS MAINSTREAM GUYZSS LOOK ANDROID!" in ANY linux forum and see what you get to read, so you dont have to read my "annoying" responses to your out-of -place-nothing-to-do-comparissons-.
 
"Because they are dropping desktops yes."
Did you just link me to an opinion-article? Lol
sure people will watch videos at home  and whatever on a tablet but just the title of that article is already stupid "the death of the pc". Unlike what you said, most of the pcs in the world are used to WORK, have fun wrtitting an essay or doing any excel or pretty much any power-use in a tablet/mobile. This is starting to become a little boring for me, you clearly have no clue what you are talking about and went google for opinions to backup your empty claims.....which then again have nothing to do with the comparisson I made. And you KEEP going with the Android mobile...oh god. I explained below what that is irrelevant to what I compared. If you want to compare facebook to bitcoin go ahead and do it!&lt; But learn the difference between a service and a technology first. Was fun anyways, I hope you learned something. Bye!

You should totally try that affluenza argument in your defense, I think you might be suffering from it.
YOU are the one spreading lies, "good news guys I spoke with Mark" seriously get the fuck out, you either know something or you dont and since you said you dont have any specific information, then you are just spreading bullshit to help your scammer friend Mark.
Of course you wouldnt admit that Mark told you something specific about this mess, because then everyone would know you are one of those insiders (which you are)

I dont think we will hear anything from Gox directly anymore (I can be dead wrong about this) but I think we will just hear from authorities and 3rd parties and not from them directly as they will avoid anything that can be used against them in the lawsuits.  They have known they are insolvent for months now and what they done with the market these last 2 weeks was illegal market manipulation. If they make a statement now saying we are insolvent sorry, they are basically admitting that they knew for months.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:03:58
I guess you werent around when it happened.. and I already explained it several times so wont do it again.
@_date: 2014-04-05 00:45:45
Yes I am sure Venezuelans and Argentinians would rather put all their savings in a cryptocurrency they never heard of and when they do a little research they will find out that in the last couple of months it lost more than half its value, ha ha ha....I am sure they want to go thru all that hiperinflation nghtmare again. Intead they would rather "invest" in any foreign currency, guess what venezuelans already do, the usd is basically street cash.

Awesome thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:41:50
Well you are wrong, these guys have been manipulating the market for months with their own BTC accounts, you could call that investment. They not only collect fees and thats it, have you been sleeping the last 2 weeks? The blatant market manipulation itself is considered fraud in any regulated market. I am sure they were running a fractional reserve and they are now being investigated over it. You know when they say "we can say we are solvent, thats confidential" it actually means that the government is investigating them for fraud and they can make any claims or they will be used against them in court. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:29:37

hehe you forgot this is try in maybe you get some decent smart answers, here you will only receive deluded silly answers like the ones above.
e: To answer your question, I see btc as a currency so I use it as a currency when I can (spending) but ont he other hand I do also hold some bitcoins and I do trade the most part of what I have. If my trading does good, i make money, if btc value goes up I make money(btc on hold) and if I spend them I promote the currency aspect of it in the hope it does well. Hope it made sense. I couldnt care less about btc, I am in just for the money just like all those people holding but they eventually create this lie in their head that they are libertarians and stuff but if it was worth 10k tomorrow I am sure they would sell.

@_date: 2014-02-24 04:52:20
Well sorry but Mark is just saying that "the solvency is a company secret" because if he says they are solvent but they are not he can also be prosecuted for that lie. The fact that he wont say "we are solvent, we have your coins dont worry" pretty much says they are insolvent/bankrupt. I am not sure why people here dont see or dont want to see reality. Mtgox is a ponzi and they are on the fall now, please for your own sake go check the ponzi wiki so you see steps of a ponzi and how it ends, mtgox has followed every single step of the fall.

@_date: 2014-03-28 12:39:46
then just join dogecoin? Not joking, dogecoin is right now where bitcoin was years ago, so basically what you say you miss. I recently joined their community as well, didnt quit bitcoin because I am a trader but as I said several times, if the idea is to have the currency of the internet, it doesnt have to be worth $500 or $1000 or $5000 or $moon  it just needs to be easily accesible and esily converted to fiat, or hell we could even have an altcoin in the future with parity with another more stable currency like the swiss frank or even parity with gold, the point is to have a p2p currency not a get rich scheme. That said, it wont stop us traders to take advantage of that get rich scheme that bitcoin is right now.
@_date: 2014-03-31 08:01:11
dude please use your brain k. I ll help you but I cant make it any easier. If you bought bitcoins at $600 for example, and use them to buy now something, the current exchange rate is $451, so you would be losing money, your purchasing power was severely crippled.
Now if after doing that , then you buy more bitcoins now for $451 each, and the price keeps going down, you would be losing more purchasing power, aka money.
@_date: 2014-04-02 23:11:14
With the amount of money launder they will be having, I give this exchange 2 months max.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:15:44
I hope you sold as I adviced now that you can actually see the crash going on. And it is just about to hit the news, once it gets to mainstream media it will crash below $500 or somewhere near. Your logic in this case is wrong, let me explain again, bitcoin is STILL a very -news-suceptible-currency- , good news it goes up bad news it goes down, you should know this already I know you do. Now if you really think that if the most known bitcoin exchange crashes it wont sink the price of btc well I am not sure how else to explain it... and this is why some people make money on forex and cryptos and some lose. I tried to be as clear as possible, english sint my main language but I am pretty sure it was clear enough, this is a no brainer, if you still havent sold I recommend you do so and buy again on the bottom. You can decide what the bottom is depending onhow bad this mtgox fiasco unfolds but by the looks of it, it will just die . gl!

And I dont find the comparisson to mtgox out of the question, considering this same thing happened to mtgox in 2011. Security in an exchange is important, for me now coinbase could easily be called conbase and I wouldnt care. After this they are just another exchange that I put in my black list.

rofl this is very sad people
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:08:02
sure this is true , but if you are TRADING you need to have BTC in the exchange...so you know you can trade :P
The golden rule here is if you dont trust any exchange then just withdraw after your trading session is over, hopefully you do very good trades so the fees wont eat you alive after each withdrawal/deposit.
Tbh I hold most of my bitcoins in a paper wallet , but when I trade I usually leave the coins in my exchange, because well my exchange is not some fucked up magic trading site but a german exchange with a very good bank behind them, see kraken and good luck. But if you are into bitcoin just to "hodl" then yes it would be stupid to leave bitcoins in an exchange or any 3rd party where you have no control.

@_date: 2014-03-18 08:59:55
But ok I will answer so you can have peace.
Assuming the the BTC market cap grows to something even slightly relevant in the "real" financial world and other cryptos get some growth as well, then people choosing between x crypto that offers x advantage over y crypto as opposed to using fiat/cheque/debit/credit/etc   matters to the overall adoption of the technology (different people will choose different cryptos and split the market cap, so it will make it hard for any crypto to become mainstream and "compete" with fiat.. On the other hand you have a person choosing a social network, whatever he choses doesnt matter because it would just affect the market share of facebook vs the market share of myspace, who compete between each other on an -already mainstream market btw-  
Remember, the important thing to get Bitcoin or any crypto to become mainstream is the market cap and here is why my original comparisson came, it could happen what happened in linux , where people believed that it would take off and replace windows or compete with it but you were given 80 choices with different feautures and people would get overwhelmed and just stick to windows (See even the apple OS has a bigger market share than all linux distros combined, because it is unique, you want it is 1 download 1 alternative, you want linux you have million choices, different sites, speeds, security so the market is split and never went mainstream)
 If another crypto gets near the bitcoin market cap then it will be hard for any of them to become mainstream and they would be stuck there competing for the 0.0005% of the financial market.
@_date: 2014-03-18 06:27:50
To me it is pretty obvious. Why would they suddenly allow people to login after their whole system was under attacks and ....to.....check....your balance....as ....if you dont know it already? 
If Mtgox really wanted you to know your exact balance they would send it privately to your registered email and add some information of why they are doing it (In order for us to pay you back, please check and confirm your balance)  but this was not the case, they just "randomly" gave you a Username and Password box (that looks like was made in 2 minutes with an exploit) with no information to check your balance. Its dead obvious to me.
@_date: 2014-03-13 20:09:53
This is not a matter of opinion ... the USD isnt the most stable currency. (There is a company that makes an index for this based on several economic factors)  Last year if I remember correctly it was the swiss franc and the singapore dollar. The USD was 5th or 6th. 
Again, "most stable" doesnt mean "most traded".

I am not against the idea of bitcoin being worth a lot in the future and having a very strong and competitive market cap, but in order to achieve that we need to somehow get off the round problem I mentioned, which is not that easy to overcome.
I disagree with your view on dogecoin tho , their community is really strong and that itself is a benefit, also many exchanges and stores are already taking them. I bought some silver coins today using dogecoin just to name an example..they gave me a nice discount.
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:28:27
This is just one more step that shows that the MTgox ponzi is insolvent. He probably didnt "resign" but kicked off. Also if I were you I would re-evaluate your logic on this sort of things.

You are making it look like it is a total nightmare to buy bitcoins. I am not sure if americans really suffer that much to purchase bitcoins but at least us europeans have SEPA transfers that take 1 day (less than 1 day in my case) to get funds in a trustable exchange (for example kraken) which doesnt requiere me to send them my ID and the story of my life to sell me a bitcoin. They also dont charge those ridiculous fees you are talking about and if you wanted and you are european you can buy 1 bitcoin within a 1 day or less, considering kraken for example gives you a $2000 daily limit with just a valid email. I really feel bad for the american bitcoin enthusiast , having all their freedoms revoked and their dreams crushed. Seems like you are having a hard time.

I lived in Berlin last year and I can tell you that there is only 1 neighborhood/district where you will be able to buy using bitcoin, its called Kreuzberg. You can find beer, food, etc, pretty much most of what you need but NOT everything. 
Of course there could be some random places that I dont know of or didnt see but most of Berlin wont have "bitcoin accepted here" so I dont wanna bust the bubble but thats how it is. Only in Kreuzberg as far as I could find.

If bitcoin's market cap EVER gets to something BARELY important in the serious financial world, the US government will come up with some more restrictions to block it, all this wall-stree jabadaba here that helps with the delusion of people here is really a joke, who the fuck is going to buy a bitcoin if you have to go through hell to buy it?

I think a large % of the people who buy bitcoins are speculators first, take me for example, I just trade BTCs because you can make in 3-4 trades what you do in the forex market with about 30-40 trades. Because volatility attracts this sort of money. I would say just a small % of the money in bitcoin is from "real btc believers" which are mostly gathered in forums like this one and some bigger ones, but the REAL money thats holding bitcoin value is pure speculation by a very colorful combination of rich men.
Also another hard truth: The current bitcoin market cap is so low that can only be compared to a company the size of Paypal. (Real -huge- money transactions are done by banks, period.) 
So the main problem with bitcoin right now is its market cap (  $ 8,276,473,830), that is ridiculously low if you compare it to pretty much anything in the NYSE. 
I would say that currently it is &gt;50% of bitcoiners= mid-high size fx speculators , +- 30% rich men holding value, 20% average joe/low capital investors and to the moon believers.
e: But just to add something, if bitcoin goes mainstream , like really mainstream then the market cap will grow and that would be reflected in the price, so a good long term investment is the answer to your question.
A government issued -e-currency would not compete with the current BTC infrastructure, so if they were to launch something like that they would have to build a whole lot of stuff to outcompete BTC.

Well I dont see why people here have such a bad attitude about this, honestly for all you deluded to the moon idiots this is actually great news. etoro is one of those trendy social brokers that  A LOT  of people know about, its very facebook-friendly so this will help with that exposure you all cry about everyday there is a new "X- coffee shop now accepts bitcoins!!" sort of stuff. THAT actually has no effect, while etoro introducing btc even in this form is great news. 
Also dont understand the guy saying "call yourself a trader if you want" just because one decides to use etoro. Well guy I am a trader and I use etoro sometimes just for fun, because of the social part, which for example hotforex or others lack, I still make money there if I "buy" gold and its price goes up and then sell. Tell me expert, how was that not trading?

I know the date of the article I linked you so no need to point it out, but yet you claimed that "in 2014 thats not as much the case as before"  without any valid source (feel free to post it unless you made it up)
For your second point, I dont know how that has anything to do with anything of what I wrote. Sure the gap is shrinking but not because people are dropping desktops but because they are buying mobiles. If you somehow tried to imply that people will just drop desktop pc, because there are some awesome tablets/mobiles in the market, well thats wrong. And then again, I compared the problem I see with bitcoin/crypto adoption  vs fiat  to ubuntu/linux vs windows. Android is not even 0.000001% of the linux/desktop market share. 
If you wanna keep insisting that "linux is already mainstream because of Android" then I respectuflly decline to continue the argument as your clearly dont understand what I wrote.

There is no such lack of reliable, trustable ways to acquire bitcoins. And volatility isnt a bad thing, if you know how to trade. Transaction speed is pretty decent, what is your compalint here again? 6 confirmations with a 0.001 fee takes less than 5 minutes and even amagi only requiered 1 confirmation to already have the order as confirmed, that after only &lt;2 min waiting time.
You should throw $50 into an exchange and learn by mistake so you actually know whatyou are talking about next time, this is kind of pointless if you are just speculating about how bad bitcoin is when you dotn even own some or dont even trade them or use them to buy stuff.

Just to give you an idea, my friend has over 70 bitcoins stuck in mtgox right now, for over 3 weeks he has been unable to withdraw. He and a group of very wealthy people already hired  lawyer to sue them. This is only ONE of the ton of lawsuits they will have to deal with, check real bitcoin forums if you want to know more about the lawsuits becuse all people here care about is stuff like "hi guys i sell soap online i accept bitcoins now"-&gt;boom front page, while people cant even use the most famous exchange as .....an exchange haha

Dude just wait a couple of weeks while MTGox reveals the truth that they cant pay what they owe, they will get massively sued , they will crash , close and this will hit the news and this will cause BTC price to crash. There is your buying opportunity, dont buy right now you will just lose money.
@_date: 2014-02-04 07:12:51
The thing is that if you have under $2000 you should do as told, they will probably pay your money, if you have more than that consider hiring a lawyer and join one of the big lawsuits that are being prepared against magic the gathering exchange or consider your money lost. MTGox is crashing because they were manipulating the market during prior BTC crashes and now they dont have enough money to pay for the btc they claim they have.
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:27:27

Well sorry but not everyone here thinks the same way you do. I am into bitcoin for trading because it is very volatile and I can take the same profit I get  in the fx market with 30-40 trades with just 3-4 trades in the bitcoin market. And probably MOST of the money in bitcoin is from speculators like me. I also like the idea of bitcoin and I hold some bitcoins for the long term but I am not deluded guys, it could really fail and some other crypto could pick up. After all just think about this, if you need a currency for the internet, p2p , with low fees, you can use basically any crypto for that, it doesnt have to be worth $500 or $1200 , it can be worth what dogecoin is worth and still work as the currency of the internet. Time will tell, but technology and history shows that stuff gets replaced by better stuff ..so be carefull with the naive thinking and deluded minds around here ...just sayin
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:41:40
A lot more than that. People have their fiat stuck in MTgox since mid 2013, recently they also put every BTC withdrawal on hold. They got money seized by the FBI (related to silk road), they have US accounts frozen because of legal issues. They are facing several lawsuits (because of keeping peoples money). They moved their office to a "virtual" office, so basically a mailbox. The "rumour" that they are insolvent is pretty much a reality now but people just dont want to see it or dont wanna accept it yet.

If you can afford that amount of BTC you can afford a good lawyer and you would be sueing already. I have to call this post bullshit. I dont think you really had 550 BTC in mtgox, any person with that kind of money is not that stupid to leave that amount in an Exchange. 
I dont believe you, honestly, only if you are a daytrader it would make sense to have such an amount in that exchange...(for maybe 2 days max!). If you really lost that kind of money , hell, I am sorry for you really but on the other hand you are very stupid..sorry

@_date: 2014-03-18 05:00:25
I think you got it all wrong. You forgot that the technology we are using is not Bitcoin but Cryptocurrency. Currently cryptocurrencies are like Linux, see you ask wtf why?  There are a million different linux distros, they all share some common grounds but theya re very different from each other, people freely chose what they like and want to use. This is exactly the same in cryptos, you can have a million different cryptos and people will freely choose whatever they like the most and meets their needs. 
Sure people here love to delude themselves and think Bitcoin is THE ONE and ONLY and will hit 10k price one day, but reality is different.  See, Bitcoin right now is for cryptos what Ubuntu is for Linux distros. The most known and used one, but not the best. 
With that comparisson in mind you could draw 2 possible scenarios for the long term of cryptos and Bitcoin. It will gain some market share (in the case of cryptos and bitcoin it would be the market cap) but never become mainstream (Just like Linux and Ubuntu) and remain there undefinately without any more significant growth. See it like, people will keep using Microsoft Windows overall because it is easier and its what they already know and the same could happen to Cryptos, people will keep using banks, cash, cheques because it is easier and its what they already know. 
The main problem I see with bitcoin´s adoption is this. There are so many different cryptos and there will be much more that eventually when people want to go "try it" they get bombarded with how many different options they have, and a lot of different feautures which they dont rlly understand and in the end they will stick to old Windows 7 and Cash/fiat/normal money.
I would love to read your thoughts on this comparisson. Sure it is pines vs apples but it resembles a lot in a lot of things, give it a thought.
The same problem that linux/ubuntu have been facing for years to become mainstream(with no sucess) will be the same one that Cryptos/Bitcoin will be facing in the upcoming ones.

Your Tesla analogy makes no sense, sorry. Tesla is a company based in the US that manufactures electric cars, so ofc I wouldnt be selling my Tesla stocks if the german stock exchange "closed" (which btw makes even less sense as they cannot simply decide to close). Tesla has nothing to do with the german SE so well you make no sense, meanwhile MTgox has everything to do with the bitcoin market, as it is one of the biggest exchanges not only in terms of volume but it is also the most known media-wise alongside with bitstamp. So MTgox closing would have a considerable effect in the price of Bitcoin. 
Your analysis seems also wrong, as MTgox wasnt "almost alone" less than a year ago, not sure where you been, we are in 2014 remember? Also it wasnt having the "same problems", they had lag issues, 1 month waiting for a fiat withdrawal and instant btc withdrawals, now we have, 3 months wait for fiat withdrawal, transactions and coins dissapearing, accounts being frozen, accounts being asked to re-send documents to validate em, lawsuits, some of their assets frozen and I can go on and on.

@_date: 2014-02-07 12:31:09
No no no...please tell me you are joking dude. Look if they ever fullfill all the withdrawals that are currently on hold and they re-active everything , then EVERYONE is going to get their money out of that exchange, as the user below said "another bankrun will happen".

The guy is sitting in an american jail now for money laundering, fraud and his "customers" received a very poor compensation (something like 12% of what they had invested).

well people who see bitcoin as a legitimate business want regulation for sure, just look at all the industry leaders , except for gox, pretty much call regulation. It will eventually happen anyways I dont see why people dont understand it. When there is money in anything there will be some sort of regulation/taxes law. All those countries who already listed bitcoin as something show a start of regulation, thats how it works, first it gets defined , then it gets a simple taxes law (for example germany) , finally and eventually it will become exactly as the current forex market (which is probably why mtgox got called by american authorities)=(inside trading, fraud,avoiding taxes, etc we will know eventually what charges are correct) , just for cryptos or will follow the path of regulation that online poker had. Pretty much one of those 2.

MTGox is facing a lot of troubles right now, you cant withdraw your bitcoins from their exchange once you buy them because they announced that they "have techincal issues" and stopped ALL withdrawals. Also fiat withdrawals have been stuck for months. Only if you have already a verified account and some money in gox then its a good idea to buy BTC, but if you dont have one, you wont be verified, your deposit probably wont go through for a few days and then your money will be stuck there undefinately or forever if the rumour that they are insolvent is true.

I think you are confused, but american laws apply to any company registered or with a subsidiary in USA, so american laws apply to Mtgox just as they would to Google or any american company.
Also you dont really have to take my word for it considering that american authorities are ALREADY after Gox.

**Well to be honest, the "general public"(meaning non-computer nerds or non-tech savy people) dont really care much about Bitcoin at the moment:**
* This is easily reflected by the current market cap ($6,440,433,383) which is this low because of the mtgox fiasco. A lot of money left the bitcoin market because of these bad news. Before this whole deal started, about 20 days ago when it started to unfold , btc market cap was over 10billion.
*Now compare this to for example Paypal (another company which people dont really pay much attention) whose current market cap is 15b. 
* I am not saying bitcoin doesnt have the potential to recover from this, I also dont say it wont be important at all , but right now Bitcoin has had many scandals, many scams, many thefts and these lowers the overall confidence in this currency as a value holder. 
* However, there are many bitcoin related companies being created which will help to grow the market cap in the future.
* Until that happens (meaning that the market cap gets higher to something "significant" in the financial world) bitcoin wont become mainstream.
* Also until it isnt -DEAD EASY- to buy a bitcoin (those ATMs could help, except in the USA) people will rather stay away from it. Because why would go go through all the hassle to buy something that is as volatile as bitcoin and  can lose its value over 40%(and more, is just one example of many crashes) in a couple days/weeks?
* In my opnion, for bitcoin to work, it needs to be used as a currency as it was meant and not as value holder as it is being used now. I know people here like the idea of investing in it (because of the many I-got-rich-stories-of-people-who-bought-A-LOT-early) but what is really the point?
* If this doesnt happen, and a new alt come is a lot easier to adquire then it will get replaced, this is how the internet people work.
* However, if some of the companies that are being worked on the paper are succesfull , bitcoin could become mainstream, with regulation of course, and I know you libertkids hate this word but unless bitcoin gets regulated it is nothing but a ponzi scheme ran BY EXCHANGES (so not that btc is a ponxi, but exchanges are). 
* Also when there are enough bitcoin-related companies the government will have and will create laws and legislation to recognize those companies and create a new classification for them , as it is not the same as a bank.
* It reminds a lot of people including me , of the start of online poker and how it was unregulated and then became regulated, you might want to look in that history and I can almost guarantee that this will be the case with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in a few years (or even months considering that a big exchange could be making a lot of peoplelose a lot of money, which could become a public scandal)
* Sadly we have these sort people like the scammer Mark Karpeles and money launderes like Charlie Shrem, just to mention 2 of the many people who had commited fraud using bitcoin, ponzis, theft , etc  who hurt Bitcoin deeply with their actions.
* If the community dont take control of Bitcoin again to force exchanges to be transparent then there is nothing we can do about these scams and eventually the government will have to step in.
* People who are running the exchanges need to be 100% transparent with their financial reports, if they choose not to do so and no one really investigate this reports then there is nothing we can do to avoid future problems like the one we are having right now.
* Also in my opnion , there needs to be transparency about the MtGox case. A lot of stuff seems manipulated, I will soon make a post with screenshot and analysis about this to show you how blatant the inside trading was during the last 20 days (But they have been doing this for months) and even more the last 72 hours are so hilariously obvious. Just see what happened the last 10 minutes that Mtgox had their trading platform enabled. See the volume please and see how many Bitcoins fleed their market during that time so you understand what I am talking about.
* Not to mention the changes in the title of the so called statement  from the other big exchanges regarding mtgox case. There is a lot of things that happened during this week that are blatant bullshit from pretty much everyone in top positions of these exchanges and even the foundation and some financial media.  A lot of questions are unanswered and this will only continue to hurt the Bitcoin image.

Saw this one coming a couple of weeks ago, sold all my bitcoins   said that bitcoin price was about to "crash" because of mtgox fiasco, posted in this sub...got buried in downvotes and was called an idiot. 
Well, I have to say it : all of you who downvoted and called me an idiot(and all those who deleted their comments) for "panic-selling" I say : HA Ha HA ha ha , who is the idiot now?
@_date: 2014-03-29 10:53:55
I totally agree with everything you said except the part where the market cap is a misleading metric. For me it is crucial for trading.
But yes, the US air-based currency is a joke and it is the biggest human tragedy nowdays.
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:13:10
And there is a very clear difference between a crash back in 2011 when the market cap was insignificant and it could happen very easily and a crash now with a bigger market cap which reflects dissapointment in the market due to all the nad news and recent exchange scams.  
I know you people like to believe that everytime it falls it will climb back up easy and for sure, and not saying it cant or wont happen again, but ffs stop being naive it can also drop below what it was worth before november , you can never know. Prepare an enter and exit strategy or just prepare to lose money.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:00:22
lol what do you mean I didnt "realize it" , of course I did, I have posted a million times here about it. I called exactly this MTgox scenario as you can see in my post history. I am pretty sure that after you check my post that got downvoted 20 days ago you will take that back ;) 
I agree many people here didnt see this coming or dont want to accept it but I am not one of them sorry.

@_date: 2014-03-29 07:22:29
Yea and I keep saying this ... people overestimate the importance of americans in the bitcoin economy a lot , some people here say (not saying you implied that for sure but maybe you did?)  that if USA were to ban bitcoin then it would not succeed and I strongly disagree. The same was said when most online-poker and online casinos had to drop american clients but yet they didnt go bankrupt, they just grew and continued to grow every day without the american market. The history of online pokers resembles a lot about the current state of bitcoin, people here interested in bitcoin should take a read about it, I will edit with a link if anyone asks. 
What is really funny (or sad?) here  is that America claims to have freedoms but people cant even play poker online...I mean....................
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:53:02
not all exchanges are shaky unstable or criminal (kraken for example is outstanding) and anyways this is not what you were saying, you implied that the price will be driven up because there are many investors investing in bitcoin infrastructure, but that is wrong, demand drives the price up, those services just enable people to buy or SELL in an easy way, and those investors earn money by each transaction made (fees). It doesnt matter if we have 100000000000 trillion bitcoin startups , if people dont buy (demand) the price will not go up, hope its clear.
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:40:20

I am sorry but this is just you guessing. Bitcoin could crash to any price (lets guess $400) and it could stay there for years. Sure we have seen crashes and recoveries but that doesnt mean it will happen every-single-time as a fact. Now, the fact that you and many people in this sub seem convinced of that is worrying to me.

I am sorry? I made over 2000 EUR in 2 days with dogecoin (feel free to check my post history for my entry-point in doge) . I am not even going to respond point by point since you made no argument at all, and you said "is not deluded" so if you think that well, I rest my case man, you are deluded.
I will remind you, the innovation is NOT BITCOIN, its the blockchain. It doesnt matter how much you love bitcoin and how much you expect it to go to the moon man, there are altcoins there for a reason, the market believes in them, some will fail some will succeed. Not every altcoin has to follow the way of bitcoin, I dont see why you hate altcoins or specifically dogecoin so much. In the end, it doesnt matter what you think or if you think of doge as a joke, because guess what? It is also being used as a currency, more tips come from doge than btc..so you know. I know you are a hodl person and that is ok , but dont get mad at me for stating the facts, if your only strategy is to hodl bitcoin and wait for its price to increase, you are dumb and deluded. Meanwhile I am making money by investing in those altcoins you hate so much. Open your mind deluded fool.

ok, whatever. But you wont have more conclusive information anyways , they will probably make a vague statement (just like mtgox did at start), then you will hear more and more speculation about it being a scam and then eventually shit hits the fan. Look man, ignore it if you want and downvote me I really dont care , but I see people always love to ignore the warning signs and trust to much in random people, if there was nothing wrong they would come up and say it but instead they are hiding and that is already a big red in my scam-o-meter. If it isnt for you ok, re-read my comment :

I always make 4 scenarios and choose 1 to trade along with it, in this case the fourth one(that is part of my strategy, so I have options in case things do go for another scenario, I have exit order to change between scenarios). I called the exact price of the current low in my exchange so ye, pretty much nailed it, as when I nailed the $1000 price with just an hour of inacuraccy, how about you? Lets see your "easy predictions". Whats your exit strategy, whats your re-entry point? I pretty much gave exact number 7 days ago in my prior post, today I am updating since my target was hit, how about yours?
I put money on this, so whatever I am speculating here I am doing it as well. Gl !

a merchant that accepts bitcoin , usually accepts litecoin as well or will eventully accept it, same goes for dogecoin, nxt, and etc altcoins. The thing is that with services like bitpay, that will eventually accept alts and if they dont other similar services will, then it will make no difference for the user to use any crypto to purchase online. Assuming bitcoin will be predominant is naive, deluded, foolish. Those services, that often are described here as "infrastructure for bitcoin" will be the same reason that the price of bitcoin will crash to pennies again; let me explain moon folks:
The idea of cryptos is to be the money of the internet, to make it easy and fast to make transactions online worldwide, ok. For that to happen, the price of a bitcoin or any crypto doesnt have to be $1  or $400 or $500000 or $moon, it just has to be easy to purchase, fast to purchase and sell, and be easily converted to real money. Any alt will do that.  Now, as more infrastructure gets build for people to buy and sell bitcoin , it will drive the price down, it is very simple. You moon deluded folks, assume that people will buy bitcoin and hoard it like you morons do, but they wont, normal people that you want in the crypto world so bad will just buy bitcoin, buy what they want to buy online or offline with bitcoin and the merchant will instantly convert it back to fiat, real fungible money. So a million atms will be put in USA, canada, etc etc countries? WOW awesome! Moon right? Nope. Just face it, if you ever will be able to purchase a bitcoin in less than a minute and also be able to sell it in less than a minute anywehere in the world, the price will be pennies. No one, except a few moon maniacs will keep bitcoin , it doesnt work as a store of value and it never will. I am amazed that people havent realized yet how overpriced a bitcoin currently is, seriously $460 for a bitcoin? hahaha, why do you even want or eed the price to go up? If you are such a believer, I am sure I will get a of those commenting, then why would you even care if its value goes bacl to $1? The idea is not bitcoin to make you fools millionaires, the idea is to have a simple, fast, easy and reliable method to transmit money with low fees. That can work with a bitcoin worth $1. I hope you understand that the current price of bitcoin is just a bubble, the sooner you realize this the less money you will lose. Bitcoin already made some people millionaires, but if you keep expecting that it will happen to you, you will be greatly dissapointed, you think it will be worth $2000 ?? $5000? etc etc ? You are deluded. Over 300 cryptocurrencies out there already, the market cap will always continue to be spread among these , good luck with your deluded dreams peeps.
@_date: 2014-02-04 07:23:44
I didnt mean sell your Bicoins on mtgox, I meant sell your bitcoins (in a decent exchange) because MTGox will face a big scandal in the upcoming weeks which will hit the news and will cause the Bitcoin price to crash, again.

This is just them continueing the market manipulation and they will keep doing it until the japs decide to step in, which mtgox is counting on that they wont do it because there is no law regarding bitcoin in jp yet.

I have to agree, I have been noticing the signs of Gox manipulating the market for over 6 months now to actually believe that this whole mess was caused by incompetence. It is very clear to me that those guys are scammers , every statement they made in the last couple of weeks they were claiming to eventually restore BTC withdrawals, but instead they moved their office to a virtual office in a hotel tower, no phones, nowhere to be found, the guys stole the money no doubt in my mind.

Ok have you heard of those huge banks in 2008 that caused (among other things) the economic crisis? Those banks that went bankrupt? I guess you heard of them yea, they also made a ton of money in fees and by investing our money in awesome investment oppotunities (which we can make the analogy with arbitrage in btc world) , you know they done that for decades , tons of experienced ppl, smart people and still went bankrupt. Now , seriously it blows my mind that people dont see it, but mtgox is OVER, they have been up for what? 4 years? They played with fire, they got burnt now, probably the very same reason that you gave for them to have A LOT  of money is the reason WHY they lost it and now they cant pay for what they claim to have.
This is a no brainer. I really cant understand how people still believe in mtgox. I have been saying this shit for over 6 months, they were manipulating the market, now they are under investigation, they will get sued, they dont have fking money or coins, how much more clear does it need to be :(

If you mean that you want to pay with bitcoin then I would use Earth VPN, because they have a ton of servers + it is very cheap and fast.

The only thing I dont like is that if you empty your account they start sending emails that your account will be closed unless you put somefunds in it.

I am having a hard time following your sarcasm and flawled logic my dear murica friend, I am also having a hard time finding such coin you are talking about, nowhere did I find a swiss gold coin that costs $340.23, unless you mean the only swiss gold coin they sell for $258.59, in which case your math is already wrong and you scammed yourself by almost $100 without even noticing. 
Now if you want me to reply being serious you need to be serious, I am not really in the mod nor have I the time to waste replying to a sad murica that you seem to be. As I said, yes you are making it look like it is a total nightmare to buy bitcoins but it is not, you listed there some scammy exchanges , wtf do I even care? It is not my problem nor my fault that people leave their bitcoins in a magic trading exchange , if you check my post history I warned people several times prior to the mtgox fiasco and I even warned people to sell bitcoins just 1 day before it all started, for some of us it was very clear what would happen, not everyone is dumb and deluded here hmm k? I dont see how that comes to the point as you said, but you mentioned it anyways, oh murica. Kraken is a safe, reliable and sepa compliant exchange, I cant understand where your panic and sarcasm is coming from, perhaps because you live in a police state I dont know, but they are backed by a german bank (Fidor AG) , I was had a personal appointment with one of their representatives when I was in Germany some months ago, you can check my post history if you like, she was kind enough to explain me everything related to kraken, I am not even going to waste my time explaining or listing why I am 100% sure about them being trustable because you seem to fear everything bitcoin related anyways. That said, I been trading with kraken for a while, some people have reported up to 7 days with their sepa transfers but it is not my case, as I said in MY case it takes usually less than 1 day and the most I had to wait was 2 days during the mtgox scandal for my funds to be transfered from my german bank to my german-backed exchange, kraken. How much would I pay for 0.6765? That would be 253,68 EUR at the current rate (375eur per btc) in kraken. You listed the eur/usd exchange rate as well, implying I give a single fuck about the shitty american currency, but hey I dont. You know you can list the price their in your own currency, in my case EUR. I dont have to deal with the air-based usd. Ok the bitcoin price fluctuates as well in euros, I see your point, but then again you forgot it can go up or down, so in the case you mentioned you would be short by a few bucks to buy your gold coin but there is the other scenario where if the price fluctuates in your favour then you will have more money. This is why your whole -argument- is pointless, you also seem to forget that all currencies fluctuate in value, gold as well. That said, you made it look like you were in a fucking rush to have fiat put into a bitcoin exchange within minutes then you were again in a fucking rush to buy a gold coin within minutes and made an example where the price would fluctuate against you and then you wouldnt be able to buy your coin within an hour. Well, do I even have to explain you murica, that you can also just wait and take advantage of the price variations? The price of gold, bitcoin, usd, eur and every single currency and precious metals on earth fluctuates , if you are smart enough and if you are in the business of buying gold anyways , I would assume you know when to buy and how to buy but I guess it is not the case with you. 
I feel sad sometimes about americans, living in fear and having all their dreams crushed by the irs news or anything that obozo says, losing money just by having savings accounts in usd for the past 5 decades, well my murica friend, I hope you get a reality check one day and hopefully everything goes well for you.

If I used coinbase my next step would be dead easy: transfer all my bitcoins to my wallet and then close my coinbase account. If this happened to my exchange you can be damn sure I would not tolarate this.

This is sad and all for the people using this exchange but it is also the fault of this subreddit´s selfcirclejerk, which downvoted everything negative about everything btc related. 
Click my nick and see that I have been posting about this MTGOX shit for over 6 months, everytime downvoted.

@_date: 2014-03-27 17:56:51
can confirm they got a very good service. I did a 2000 eur deposit yesterday and it was in my balance this morning. Crypto withdrawals are instant, and sepa withdrawals usually take 1 or 2 days , this in my case. You got that pretty fast !

If people dont accept the fact that mtgox is insolvent now....I dont see what else they need:
* No fiat withdrawals for months
* NO BTC withdrawals for weeks
* Gox gets accounts frozen + money seized
* Several known lawsuits+ those we dont know of
* No announcement from Gox claiming "coins are safe"
* Several techincal issues that are still not fixed
* MTGox moves their office to a virtual office in a hotel tower.
* Karpeles resigns from BTC foundation
* MTGox deletes all their tweets from Twitter
Want me to keep going..?
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:57:09
No troll here: Please sell your coins now, this fiasco has not yet reached its climax, next 2 weeks are downhill.
I sold all my coins @ 820, waiting for all this fiasco to hit mainstream media and then you will really see the price drop. In the post I made about this I said I expect under $500 once the first class action lawsuit is on the way and once all this hits the news. 
I wouldnt buy after the weekend, we must first see what will happen with mtgox, if they sink (which is what I think) I will be buying in aprox 2 weeks.
tl;dr sell now buy -CHEAP COINSGUYSS- in 2 weeks.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:47:51
Yea people talking about it in this sub means NOTHING. That is why MTgox keeps getting new costumers every day and the next day they are complaining about failed transactions. It hasnt hit the news, MTgox crashing is something a very few people know and even in those discussions you mention people keep backing them up and keep expecting them to pay their debts. Its not happening yet, the MTgox crash will be a very significant one. 
You seem very optimistic, but once Gox dies , that people you mention wont be probably in the mood to jump into another exchange just after they lost their money, or had to go thru legal expenses to get they $ back. If you think MTGox crashing wont cause a big BTC crash well my friend, you are one of those deluded idiots in this sub.

Hopefully not too many people fell for this...blatant obvious people come on!
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:55:24
ha ha ha. Seriously, I hope you dont delete your comments here once the first class action lawsuit against MTGox hits the news. Again, if you think that will have no effect, well you are very naive. I am not "losing my mind" , I am also not a troll and I am not interested in spreading FUD, but please believe what you want. 
"The outlook for 2014 is still very good" , ok lol....I am sure you base this statement in....hmmm .....ehmmmmmm technical.....hmm no, what analysis could it be? Maybe is it you guessing again? You might as well just come here and say to the moon little naive kid.
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:08:24
Well we agree on something yea, the next weeks will be a very good re-entry point to buy. But mtgox dieing is a big hit for bitcoin however, I know what you mean, bitcoin itself is just fine but its image will be very affected by this and therefor its recovery will take longer than the usual crashes. IMO
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:06:16
Sorry I was mad. I know I aint no prophet but sadly I still find people here defending mtgox and it blows my mind. 
Hint: scroll down the comments you will see people saying "why is people freaking out, its temporary"  "amazing how people spread FUD, mtgox is strong"  and etc comments .....there are a ton, for 6 months that I KNOW of mtgox has been manipulating the market and therefor I was posting everytime about it and everytime people go defend them.
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:53:26
Well I have traveled SEVERAL TIMES to Panama and I never  had  problem when paying with USD, I know you live there but wow come on everyone knows it is like this in almost every country that accepts USD, the people receiveing it need to triple check thats legit dollars, thats whz you dont pay a soda with a $100 bill.
Also never had to give my information when paying with USD, so I call this post pretty much bullshit in my experience.
Been to a million hotels in panama, a million "stores", zona libre, wherever and never had anyone take my name or ID to pay with dollars lol.....
why is this shit upvoted anyways this sub is so dumb thats hilarious
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:00:21
Casinos are there to gamble, you could even gamble in Bitcoin I care, but puting money on mtgox at this point isnt a gamble , is simply stupid and its exactly what mtgox scammers want. Dumb people fall for it ...
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:44:19
A lot of people here seem to forget that Gox is registered with Fincen and has an "office" in the USA (Delaware if I am correct), so USA laws apply to them as for any other american-based company. 
Just wait a bit until Karpeles will be arrested for fraud.
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:20:39
People are quick to defend scammers, I dont understand why but you are just one more example of a deluded guy who cant face reality even when it slaps your face. The guy lied about everything, even involved his daughter in the lie which is pretty low and yet some people will do whatever to defend obvious scammers. Poor soul

@_date: 2014-03-31 00:15:29
Right now? Sit on euros while I decide what the bottom is and buy  some dogecoins meanwhile, because I have confidence in this alt (because of their impressive market cap and 24h volume in such a young age for a coin). I will buy back some bitcoins when there is a clear announcement about the situation in china and the new&amp;bee probable scam/fraud, if that turns to be true, then bitcoin will keep crashing, if not then it will probably recover - thats my view and I can be totally wrong just like everyone else here. All I am saying is that the OP sounds deluded because he assumes that bitcoin will go up in price no matter what. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:09:00

@_date: 2014-03-29 03:57:56
I think most of the educated ones sold when it went over $1000.I am not saying it could not rise over that again, anything can happen, but taking profit and recovering your initial investment is very important. That is why I think the whole idea of just holding bitcoins is sort of stupid , deluded and naive, trading it is better, because after all any other crypto can be used as the currency of the internet, if bitcoin gets widely adopted people will start also accepting other altocoins (it is already the case in many of the bitcoin accepted places..) which are MUCH cheaper and faster than bitcoin. So sure, anything can happen, but realize gains and then play with some of the profit to "hodl" for the moon if you like but always keep a separate account and trade some to lessen your loses in case the price doesnt skyrocket.. after all ,. any other altcoin could take over anytime.

You are wasting your time my friend, people wont listen. I personally posted about the exact MTGox scenario we have today , about 6 months ago (here) and got called an idiot. I posted again 20 days before BTC withdrawals went off, same result, also posted the day before. 
I wont even waste my time showing people why BTC-E is the next or worse Mtgox., they will continue to use it , then lose money then come here and complaint.
@_date: 2014-04-01 22:29:21
It doesnt have to be better to be used, also who is butthurt here? I own bitcoins and dogecoins, both have pros and cons, I even owned litecoins at some point. I can use them all if I want and guess what? I am a serious trader, maybe slightly different than being an "investor" but it is similar and let me tell you that you are being very close-minded here. Again, dont forget how bitcoin started, it was also worth cents, remember litecoins? Same story. Bitcoin was pumped and now is being dumped, I am sorry if your strategy is to "hodl" and that is why my comment hurt your feelings so much, but not everyone has uses that dumb "strategy" with their money. You cant read the future, bitcoin could be worth $1 next month for all we know and we would have a nunch of people that lost their money, on the other hand dogecoin could also be worth $1 next month and you would have a bunch of gazillionaires , just like bitcoin had theirs in november. Open your naive mind a little bit, if you think "no serious" investor has a ton of money invested in altcoins, you are yet another deluded peep from @_date: 2014-02-10 13:27:23

I am not sure you know about laws, but at least in my country, in the case you mention , I wouldnt be arrested or prosecuted for money laundering unless the authorities can prove that I knew the money was "dirty"...so guess what.

my suggestion: change the subject  or  pray that none of them watch tv and heard of the recent scams or how btc lost more than hal its value in a couple of months , etc etc. Because if they heard of any of that (e,g: mtgox) then you will have to answer some akward questions ...

@_date: 2014-02-04 07:37:05
Well I have to disagree. MTGox is one of the first and currently one of the oldest (if not the oldest) bitcoin exchanges that havent shut down. It is also the most *known* bitcoin exchange out there and not to mention the volume traded .... so it would be naive to think that if/when Mtgox crashes nothing would happen to the price of BTC. It is very clear to me that this scandal and this crash will be a lot bigger than the one we had related to bitcoin china.
Sure I know people here love to lose money with that logic that "if it crashes I will buy a lot  more  cheap coins and it will bounce back stronger than before!!!" but I am not one of those deluded ones and I deep down hope there are enough smart people to realize whats going on and when its a good time to sell instead of hoarding like idiots.

What exactly is false? Those emails there belong to coinbase customers, they didnt agree to have their information be shared in public. That is not false and just a suggestion, so people wont bankrun from your exchange, when shit hits the fan is better to come up clean instead of spreading lies to cover your mistakes.
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:49:24

Nice work!
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:17:37
so why would you spend bitcoins right now if  bought them @ say $600 or $700 ? You would be losing money just by doing that, would be the same as selling and realizing loses.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:35:12
yes but I hope its true and not just a staement to calm people down, for me btc-e is not to trust as it was mtgox but if they do this they will change my mind for sure.

True, but IF they happen to re-open what do you think that every single (smart) customer of mtgox will do? They will get all their money/coins out and find a decent exchange, there is no way mtgox will survive this.  
This subreddit alone declared mtgox dead, is not just me lol. And this sub is really small compared to some of the bigger bitcoin communities where the word is the same.
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:04:31
maybe not bitcoin I agree but probably a "better" crypto, the technology wont dissapear it will evolve.
I see bitcoin as something Paypal could have done if they were interested in innovation instead of harrasing clients. I see bitcoin or cryptos as some sort of paypal killer. And anything better and creative that will be invented will eventually replace bitcoin, that is just how things are.
Hell, we could even see -government issued- cryptos "e-usd" etc.. seems like the more realistic scenario for me if we are speaking in 10 years which will be 2024. We can only imagine what technologies will be like by then, people tend to forget that most of what we are using internet-wise and computer-wise is just 2 decades old...
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:59:38
This is not a rumour....oh dear god.
I know some people have received their EUR withdrawals but the bulk of the money from Gox is USD and those accounts are frozen because of criminal investigations, which makes them insolvent.
@_date: 2014-03-18 06:39:40
I trust everything MTGox says.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:25:56
Sure , I wont be deleting my comments if I am proven wrong. That said, MTgox will probably just announce withdrawal fees and ridiculous withdrawal limits (something like 1 btc/day)  to keep stalling the market, IF they even announce anything. At this point they can do and will continue to do whatever they want. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 07:08:02
I feel bad for mtgox users, also because this subreddit keeps downvoting every bad post related to the mtgox scandal going on right now, because "aparently" it is known by everyone for 6 months.
Mtgox has no money to pay because they were manipulating the market during the btc crashes, they are weeks away from the first class action lawsuit and once that happens we have our next btc crash.
@_date: 2014-03-31 00:03:04

Those banks that went bankrupt in 2008 as part of the world financial crisis, remember? What MTGox makes a day is pocket change for these banks and yet they went bakrupt. 
MTGox is/was probably running a fractional reserve, or straight ponzi scheme , faking volume , money laundering, market manipulation, fraud. I cant believe people think they cant be insolvent just because they make millions in profit. Again, please read about those banks in 2008, you will see how big companies lose a lot of money.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:06:03

why would "big banking" support bitcoin at all instead of you know.....making their own altcoin? It is dead easy to make a cryptocoin, if this ever becomes "a thing" that most people will use, banks/governments will come up with their own version of bitcoin,  call it e-dollar, whatfuckingever, dont be deluded people pls...

to be completely honest here, if Paypal were to implement anything bitcoin related THERE IS NO WAY I would use them. Not after they held my money hostage (&gt;$3000) for no fucking reason whatsoever. I really hope Paypal burns in hell and go bankrupt as soon as possible for the good of humanity.

Aww guys, I mean the guys at dogecoin try really hard not to make fun of bitcoiners and yet you just upvote this? I own both bitcoin and doge , the communtity here tries hard to make fun of them while the community there tries really hard to not make fun of you here (considering your beloved moon bitcoin has been plummeting in value since november and yet you are deluded) but ok , hehe funny jokes!  
@_date: 2014-03-29 10:56:09
I am not a newcomer, that is a nice phrase deluded people here like to throw all over so they dont have to actually make a credible argument or any argument at all, like you just did.
@_date: 2014-03-29 04:26:20
So what exactly is it that you are complaining about? 1,48% fee? or?
Also you dont have a clue about how to purchase gold mate, all  your math is right this time, thanks god but now go ahead and do the same and select VISA as payment, then you will see the price difference. I Just bought this coin, even when I dont like it but just for fun this mornign after I replied to you, I paid with bitcoin 229 EUR, including shipping in total. You might wonder why the price difference between you and me, it is because I know how to purchase precious metals and you dont, or at least your comment shows that.. You also didnt take advantage of any of the price fluctuations. Why would you inmediately buy the gold coin without taking advantage of the price fluctuations of bitcoin? I mean you are basically missing a big discount here just by hating bitcoin my murica friend, you are missing all the arbitrage opportunities and you are missing money. If you need a better explanation be sure to pm me in a nice way and I will give you some protips so you dont scam yourself if you are rlly into buying gold coins. I would send you the coin (honestly) but probably your murica government would seize it , steal it and burn it just like they did with your dreams , hopes and privacy.
E: and just in case you dont believe me I will edit this comment later and add the receipt and confirmation  from amagi that I bought the coin for that price.

I think generalizing like this is wrong tho. I would say that about 90% of the people in this sub (judging by the comments/posts) are deluded and have no clue or little if any financial education, but there is also the other part of the story, we also have many here who are daytraders coming from the well established fx market, such as myself, who just "use" bitcoin as another currency to take profit from. You gotta understand that you can make the same amount of profit with 3 or 4 trades in the bitcoin market that you would do with 30 or 40 trades in the Fx market, because bitcoin is WAY too volatile compared to government currencies. I been making profit for over 6 months in bitcoin market and what I earned already exceed my total equity after 6 years of trading forex, much of that thanks to the  rise to $1200. I already took most of my money out and bought some really nice stuff that I always dreamed of , you have to try and be less closed-minded with this sort of statments. You are kinda calling us all "bitcoiners" and calling everyone who invests or speculates in bitcoin a dumb person, but you are just plain wrong sorry, had to say it.

Why would I support scammers? They manipulate the market every single day and hurt the whole BTC market. They lie in their press announcements, they leak information to insiders, etc etc etc. Karpeles is a criminal and I wont stop saying it just because some deluded people dont want to accept facts and reality.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:20:40
This case is a no brainer really. The guy was money laundering for over a year , he knew the person he was selling btc was involved with drug money, he didnt report it but he kept doing it. He got arrested because there is proof that he knew about the drug money and what he will debate with his expensive bullshit lawyers is that he didnt know. Sure he is not a rapist but he is still a criminal and he hurt bitcoin bad already and now comes to reddit to defend another criminal, mark the gox scammer who is probably in the bahamas with all that money he stole laughing his ass off.

@_date: 2014-02-07 13:11:11
Are you willing to bet that for real? I would take this bet any day. I am up for it.
The investigations that WE know of , but I tend to believe that these guys have been manipulating the market for at least 6 months and there are several reports on this. Now probably this whole deal has to do with it, they probably lost a lot of money and are being investigated about it (note that the ceo keeps saying: "stuff we cannot talk about..")
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:25:15
I am honestly glad that you got your coins back, however check 
Over 169 pages of people having issues with their withdrawals, if you take a look at the most recent posts you will notice that some people have been waiting over 3 months for a fiat withdrawal as well as btc withdrawals. 
Go ahead and post the email you received, I guess that will bring some confort to the guys suffering with their money stucked. 
I am simply posting  this so newcomers dont make the mistake of puting their money on mtgox, because they will be waiting for months or weeks if lucky to be able to do a proper transaction and will have to send a ton of emails to support to calm their shit out. 
Now, if you decide to ignore that MTGox will be sued and you continue to use that "exchange" well go ahead , its your money after all, but it is really naive to think that mtgox is ok, just take a look at that link, or actually at that forum you will see many other threads about it, or simply go to twitter and search mtgox, take a look and see how many customers complain about what am saying here and see the SAME standarized -we-dont-give-a-fuck- answer they got everytime from support. Mtgox is going to crash.

I am not saying he is right that the price will drop, but I will explain you that date is when the latest chinese announcement actually takes legal effect, what we had was just a non-confirmed announcement, but if it is right then that could be an important date and in my opinion the value could drop like it did last time China -attacked- bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:31:03
Wow you believe in the constitution, of which country btw? I will assume you are american because you assume everyone must know that you are american. 
You are very ignorant, I am not a troll you kid, the guy you are defending is a criminal, he was money laundering and he knew it, go read a little. The only reason he is not in jail yet is because he can afford expensive lawyers to try and cover his ass, but dont be fucking naive, he knew the guy was doing business in silk road, he knew that was drug money, he knew he was money laundering, he got caught, he hires lawyers , some naive stupid people like you fanboy him and ride his dick all over the internet but in the end he is still a criminal. Keep insulting me kid , I give 0 fucks about stupid people like you defending a moron like this criminal.

@_date: 2014-02-07 13:00:16
Sorry but you are wrong. The "smart money" or "big money" is sticking with them because they CANT get their money out, not because they believe in mtgox, but because THEY LITERALLY CANT GET THE FUCK OUT. Theres people trying to withdraw for months with no success and all they get is "please be patient."  
Please dont turn the story to make it convinient for mtgox, because thats not the truth.

Not too far from reality, to be honest I think they will just add fees for BTC withdrawals and add a very fucked up limit like 1 BTC/day, so if people want to get out massively they wont be able to. MTGox market manipulation continues.

That would only happen if it was a WORLDWIDE ban, if they ban it in the US, sure there will be some temporary drop in demand, but those investors who want to buy them probably have bank accounts all over the world anyways, and those like me who dont live or dont give a fuck about what happens in the US will simply ignore that ban. (Like the online poker ban or the porn ban in the uk...to give some examples) the rest of the world goes on while the land of freedom cuts every possible freedom for their people...sad but true :S

Now that we are over $1000 , the next big thing will what happens when/if it hits $1250ish (price per ounce of gold). That will say a lot about btc ´s future.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:03:08
$1170 all time high today. That is why I think this will happen in a matter of days , if not tonight.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:02:23
It is a cryptocurrency, thats what it is. Just because its price is high doesnt necesary mean it is a bubble, see again that same poor argument.
Sure, currently it is being used to speculate, but do you really not see what is being build around it? I am not talking about people accepting btcs in coffee shops (altought that helps), but the amount of companies creating infrastructure to allow btc to reach its original goal. 
Not sure why volatility its soooo bad for you, as in any market there will be volatility while it gets more mature, right now it is a daytrader´s dream. Your definition of price correction is dead wrong. Remember we are @ $1070 right now, if it were to drop to $20 it wouldnt be a price correction , it would be a market crash. We already had a correction today (well yesterday cuz its 2am now) it went from $1073 to $914 after the $1000 break.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:14:23

I think 10k is unrealistic a year from now. My most optimistic analysis shows $1600-$2200 by the end of 2014, that if there is no more panic sells or a big crash.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:27:09
Ok thats cool.
First of all I own bitcoins, also litecoins. I am a forex daytrader who got bought btcs 6 month ago, litecoins 1 month ago.
For me, bitcoin is just another tool to make profit. I havent spend a single bitcoin on merchants, but I do trade the btc everyday. That is what most rich people are doing (not implying I am rich) right now, they are making huge profits from the volatility. Now, you are aware , I hope, that MOST bitcoins are owned by a little amount of ultra-rich people. That is one problem, because this market is far from being mature(current market cap) , so if they felt its time to take profit, say tomorrow, bitcoin would crash tomorrow. IMO they are just waiting longer to see what the true potential of THE PRICE of bitcoin is, so they can maximize their profit. 
That last part is an assumption, the first part is a fact, they own the bitcoin market. 
My criticism to bitcoin right now?  It is supossed to be decentralized, but we already see that the two biggest miner pools have over 51% (you can see this is blockchain).
Another thing being said is that it is the perfect currency because it cant be manipulated, but at the current market cap and price it only takes 2m dollars to drive the price $100 up or down, so the market can and it is being manipulated.(that amount is pocket change for the ultra-rich)
Another one, it is supossed to be a currency but it is hardly being used as one, people hoarding, confirmation times? If I wanted to buy a coffee by the time my transaction gets confirmed it will be cold, so as of now it is useless as a currency. Those are just a few reasons, but I can continue. I dont wish bitcoin to fail but it is not in OUR hands, those guys holding the BIG amounts of bitcoins will decide what happens. Sad but true, if they want to take profit tomorrow, tomorrow the bitcoin price crashes. That makes it a very unstable "currency".
More flaws regarding the protocol, in theory a "selfish miner attack" could happen, you can google that. Another problem are ddos attacks, which are practically impossible to avoid and serve for more market manipulation. For example BTCchina has suffered several (and probably right now is under one as it is DOWN). I think cryptocurrencies are a good idea, but a lot has to be done to avoid money laundering because otherwise they will be declared illegal (sure you cant stop bitcoin but can stop transactions to real currencies)
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:02:34

@_date: 2013-12-08 21:07:23
I explained why, but here again. While his friend or family whatever already locked profit and can re-enter the market at any point with profit-investment he is just holding assuming the price will go up in the long run. You are also assuming bitcoin will perform well in the long rong but that is as accurate as saying it will be worth $0. I call him stupid because I call every deluded holder to the-moon type of guy stupid, it is pointless and he contradicts himself saying that his friends only care about the price. HE and you and most here are in for the money, thast it, you can believe bitcoin will be mainstream and replace the dollar or whatever but you are still in this to eventually cash in and take profit. Holding is dumb, even more if you believe in bitcoin because if you believe in bitcoin as a currency you should be using it as a currency (spending it) instead of holding it like a gold bar.
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:39:38

Right now bitcoin is commodity money, if you don't understand this please first finish highschool kid.
Of course exchanges are important and totally needed for bitcoin to succeed, lets see your case for example...god you are damn stupid but lets see: You have bitcoins, how did you get them? You bought them using an exchange. Now assume there was no exchanges at all, you wanted bitcoins (which would be probably worth cents considering there are no exchanges) what do you do? Sure you can mine them now (the difficuly level is on the floor) ! Spend a few weeks mining bitcoins that are worth cents and spend them! Way to go dude. 
I feel a bit sad for you kid honestly, you seem like you want to know what you are talking about but then you go full retard and just write nonsense again. Exchanges are important, when you say they are not you are being very very stupid boy. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:00:04
Yes I could have made more but I am following a system so I rather dont take unnecesary risks when I can profit and then buy again and so the same over and over. 
Well it is not really a matter of time dude, it is a matter of what scenario happens. As more data comes more gets thrown into the analysis but as right now I am just gonna wait until it bounces back to $920 or a little below that before buying again. If this doesnt happen (thast my 1st most likely scenario), I will throw in the new data and make new scenarios and buy at a different price, set a new target, set a new "take profit" and a new "stop loss" . If I wasnt clear enough please tell me and I will try and be more specific Is just that so much is going on right now !
(Also note that I didnt sell ALL my btc! , I am trading some and holding some for the long run, this way you make more money, even if you only own a few btcs) 
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:43:57


Anyone dumb enough to throw ALL THEIR MONEY in an investment deserve to lose it, I am sorry but that is the truth.
I disagree with your definition of price correction. How did you define that "unjustified" speculation began at $20? btw? How do you even know what the "correct" price is, when the prices havent even stabilized?

@_date: 2013-11-27 19:21:20
Exactly, my prediction was that it would hit $1024 and bounce to $920 but it went higher than that. I sold @ 1024 and bought back at the bounce 920 as I said. Right now I am holding while I make the scenarios for tonight and tomorrow morning. (I start trading at 23:00 German time, thats CET I think) and stop once I hit my scenario.

haha, you go flip burgers while I daytrade kid. I will not claim I was right if I will be right, that is pointless and sad. However I think if my prediction fails you will be posting here some other stupid comment. I have 2 scenarios, one shows what I wrote the other one shows a price drop under $930 which seemed unlikely for me so I went for the one I posted. Also as I write this it just hit the $1000. Congratz !
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:20:41
I asked a similar question and what I understood is that you get taxed on gains when/if you convert it to your currency. If you keep your bitcoins in your wallet or spend in a bitcoin accepted merchant that transaction is not taxed AFAIK.

I don't think it is a war. I think as long as bitcoin does well litcoin will do well too. They are brothers. I dont get emotionally attached with my investments, but I like the idea of a future where bitcoin is a value holder and litecoin is the one you will be spending for your coffee. I recommend buying litecoin now that is cheap so you dont regret it in a few months. I bought litecoin  .
Litecoin´s market cap is increasing even faster than bitcoin´s......

Bitstamp and coinbase are pretty much safe, however mtgox has been manipulating the price way too much so in my opinion this magic cards exchange should go broke if we see a sub $300 price, those "lags" you see is them trying to control the crash but they can only do it so much....longer...

@_date: 2013-12-01 23:34:41
That is true, but it doesnt mean that bitcoin will be worth 1 million dollars, which is what people here think will happen just because we are on the early stage of cryptos.

I dont think ebay will be accepting btc anytime soon tho..

I am getting tired of posting this but I will do it one last time for you.
People forget that China is a totalitarian regime, if the government says "perhaps you shouldnt accept bitcoins" it means in reality "do not fucking accept bitcoins or we will fuck you up". I can put that in nicer words but I want you to understand the idea. The chinese government has long term plans for the yuan´s development, they wont allow an internet currency to take off and damage their plans. They recently announced they will be cutting down their USD reserves (remember they are  USD holders in the world) to finally let the yuan take off, so I am sorry, your story is very cool and all but it wont be happening in China. The oficial statement in chinese said bitcoin has no legal basis. Next day merchants banks and pretty much all the guys who were promoting and accepting bitcoin had to make an u-turn and forget it. Individuals can still trade it, just not the average chinese-joe with a chinese bank account, which basically hurts bitcoin´s growth.
So woo hoo!

I ll copy it from another topic where the same question was asked:
    Verification @ Exchanges: Up until 2 days ago, nobody had to prove their identity beyond confirming a mobile phone on BTC China. Today, all trades require you to be ID verified. Yes, most exchanges in the world require this today, however, these exchanges did not. Certainly, by requiring identity verification, black/gray markets which operated through China will be impacted.
China was using Bitcoin to get money into and out of the country with no government intervention. You can be sure that with the new changes to the exchange systems, that governments will be able to keep a close eye on transactions, and prevent the bypassing of currency controls.
    B2C Transactions: When China said bitcoins are not currency, they also meant that products can not be legally sold for bitcoins. Major retailers which were just beginning to accept BTC in China have now completely separated themselves from it. China was by far the leader in bitcoin B2C commerce, and they are now at the very bottom.
    Likelihood of Further Regulation: From the Chinese announcement, we can see what the government thinks of bitcoin. They will take any necessary steps to keep their currency controls intact. If bitcoin becomes a threat, they'll take further measures to squash it.
And as for your question, the answer is yes but they didnt say it directly. They said "bitcoin should not be used.." and when a totalitarian regime says you should not, they mean if you do it we will fuck you up. But 99% deluded people in this sub will tell you China´s news are awesome news, to the moon! and I will get downvoted but dont care :=)

what is your source to claim that only very very few are successful? "Thanks" to the current volatility in bitcoin A HUGE amount of fx traders are trading the btc since you can make with 3-4 trades what you would make in the forex market with 20-30 trades. There are successful ways of trading and it is not as complicated as it seems, people just tend to be lazy and assume its pure gamble but ignore there are ways to analyze the market and make good trading desitions.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:25:03
I already made profit, sorry. For me it is also fun to read all the negative comments from people who think that trading is like playing poker. There are tools out there you are just a dumb "kid" if you dont want to use them to make money. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-25 00:50:20
Sure for a 16+ it would be useful, thats why I just included in my "rant" pre-teens (&lt;12y), kids, babies, etc. The whole inflated number of the "analysis" is plain wrong , i he wanted he could have gone to the WHO and filtered some numbers to get the right population he is speaking about, instead he didnt and he wrote a huge amount of crap based on that 6.5 billion number and that brings down everything else he said in his post.
I agree with what you said, except that you are also assuming that poor people will have even the shittiest phone, but that is not rlly the case, I have worked with charities in the past and these people cant even afford the shittiest phone you can think of and those who happen to have one (&lt;$10 phone) cant afford to make calls, they just receive them and even less cant afford a data plan (internet) , so I am sorry, I want bitcoin to be there for those people  you are speaking about,....but it is not as simple as it sounds and these numbers are dead wrong, they not only include kids but also poor people (less than a dollar a day according to World health organization) , places like India which are seen here as a "great" opportunity for bitcoin are dead poor, half the population is poor, bitcoin wont do much there. I have the opposite thinking, for me bitcoin is internet money for people with decent money, just think about everything you have to do to buy a bitcoin and then put yourself in the shoes of a poor person who has not only no home, no food, no cellphone , no internet but also no interest in this because they dont even have fiat to convert to btc... I hope I was clear enough, these are just a bit deluded theories sadly :(

you are wrong and you are also DELUDED. You should probably quit this subreddit to cure your deluded brain. 
"Bobby lee clearly has made a very obvious error in his conclusion saying noone can price things in Bitcoin or do business in Bitcoin."
This isnt Boby Lee´s conclusion, this is what the official statment of China said. It said it exactly like that. You cannot price thing in BTC , why on earth would you put your head in the hole instead of just accepting the facts?

In that case where bitcoin and other cyrptos were mainstream yes I would just switch my money from one to another to keep my balance safe so avoid banks as much. BUT it could also happen that SOME governments declare it illegal as a currency, like for example China where merchants can no longer advertice prices in BTC nor receive them, so my guess is that if cryos would really become "dangerous" for any government they would simply ban it, considering banks are the "pillar" of their economy and would be too risky for them to let it happen.

@_date: 2013-12-04 05:00:28
I would just trust a user with reputable history if he said it was legit. I dont mean to call you a scammer, I just asked if anyone is willing to test it to be sure. 99% of these website posted here are scams sadly. Also the website looks good but those customer "reviews" look scripted to me ...but if no one else will test it I probably will end up doing it and will confirm if its legit or not. One question, are you planning on offering other altcoins and other payment options?

You can predict patterns and market trends by using technical analysis to set a specific trading system in forex trading, as you can in btc and litecoin trading. You usually end up with the 2 most probable scenarios. I posted the one I think will happen. In forex you would set a "stop loss" and "take profit", since indeed you cant be %100 which scenario will happen, you choose one, I chose this one for today´s trading. If you want to know more about it I can link you a very good e-book explaining basic trading. People who fail in the markets are those who think like you dude, no offense. Also its $2 away from hitting the $1000. In forex I would set a take proft @ $1024 which is what my  scenario shows me, then sell and buy again once it bounces. In btc trading I have to do this manually as for now the exchange I use doesnt have the proper trading tools.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:26:47
I was just throwing out a prediction. It was met on the upside but not on the downside so I was wrong. I dont think anything I post on reddit will make people sell or buy and make any important change to the price , so that was not my intention. I was simply suggesting what my system showed as the most likely scenario, people can follow it or ignore it. 
I will just look back at these topics in a few weeks and see what failed in the analysis so hopefully I can correct it for better performance.
I sure think holding bitcoins is the best choice to do, but if you are daytrading it you need to be selling and buying.  
Sure I will be saying sell or buy when thats what my system suggest is the best thing to do ! 
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:19:45

@_date: 2013-12-01 03:00:43
This is the problem in this subreddit, people keep thinking that they will hold forever but the reality is that for them is pure business, they care about the money not bitcoin, the actual money they can make while using bitcoin as a tool, using naive people as a tool. The only smart in the bitcoin market is to trade the btc, then you can actually make some profit. Do you really think the twins, for example give a fuck about bitcoin? Sure we all saw those nice interviews, but they simply want more people to get in so they can make more money, they are even making a fund for it god...
Eventually they will cash out, because bitcoins are useless, sure not popular here and all the ideology is nice, but they want cash. As you say, the price seems stucked at around $1200, if it stops going up...tell me  those early ones who bought cheap and see the price wont continue to rise, what do you think they are gonna do? Hold a useless currency? Buy pizzas using bitcoin? Or sell, take profit in dollars and jump to the next investment?
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:26:38

Are you fucking stupid, since bitcoin is out , people have been able to buy them online. It is a fucking internet based cryptocurrency, god damn stop saying you understand shit if you keep posting stupid shit like this honestly. I am not jelous that I didnt get in when it was worth pennies, as I said I am a trader and any decent trader wouldnt be regreting the past, I guess you are talking about yourself here . I actually do have a succesful strategy to trade btc as well as I do in forex, but hell how would you know? I am also holding some btcs as an investment, but I am not a stupid deluded kid like you, btc coud be worth $0 as well, if you dont consider that you are dumb and deluded. It could also be worth $10.000 , remember you are not a wizard so stop acting like you know as a fact what will happen stupid littke kid.  I think you don't even own a bitcoin, the way you write about this makes me think what I originally said, you are just another dumb child in this subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:27:18
I think you are confusing "sentiment" analyis with technical analysis. Trading based on news,media attention and what you hear or "see" or "think" its happening its that, sentiment analysis. There is also fundamental analysis and technical analysis. The tools are out there, I guess people here are just too lazy to learn the basics of trading but I repeat, you can predict market trends by using proper technical analysis and a good trading system or what you call "looking at graphs". 
Now "bitcoins a ride, just go along with it" ...well needless to say but this is why people lose money on forex. If my trading system based on my analysis ever concludes that a "crash" is coming I will be the one selling. A crash however is no longer in the range of what I consider possible (that ofc depends on what YOU consider a crash). Ofc you will see price drops, but bitcoin is just getting more mature, prices will stabilize eventually. The only event worth taking a look IMO is when it hits parity wth gold (1 btc 1 ounce).
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:47:13

Thats not how trading works afaik, if you take profit and the price rises after it doesnt really matter, because you are trading it just like any other currency. This is what I think most here dont understand. If you guys want it to be a currency it needs to be used as a currency (traded,spent,marchants,etc) but if it is just hoarders and speculators (which imo is what it is) we are only waiting for the bubble to pop. And recent news from China just triggered that. The only reason we dont have a $600 or less price right now is because mtgox is just "lagged" meaning there was a massive sell causing a massive crash and they are manipulating the price to avoid a very massive crash. 
If it didnt look like a pyramid before, I dont know what people here need to open their eyes...take a look at the charts , take a look at the "lag" of the biggest non-cn exchange and you will see the manipulation. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:06:16
I wouldnt start a topic like that because ti will look like I work for them or smth which I dont. I just own a decent amount of bitcoins, I daytrade part of them (call it smallish amounts) using the same system I use to trade EUR/USD on forex. I just cashout or withdrawal when I hit profit over $1000 eur using wire transfer. I usually have my money withing 5-7 week days (which its slow but nowhere near 6months). I am also holding a smaller amount of bitcoins for the long run no matter what. 
I will take a look at that link when I get home (currently on mobile sry for grammar) so I can actually talk about it.
I am also not new to reddit, is just that I am not that proud of my other account  :P 
I am also sorry to hear that you have that many problems with mtgox :S I will definately be cautious and as soon as there is something better for me I will go there, for now this works

I made a new account yesterday but been long in reddit with my other account, I just dont feel like sharig my investments with my "real" account in reddit , not sure whats hard to understand about it. I heard about bitcoin in 2011, unfortunately I just boguth 2 btc then because I was scared of the whole silkroad thing, 2012 I bought a very considerable amount, so no I am not new to btc and I actually daytrade it as I do with forex.

So?  Btc is the dream of a daytrader dude, exactly because its volatility! 
While I have to make 20+ trades a day to see some decent profit in forex I can do the same in btc with 3 or 4 trades a day..
Thanks, been using this system for over 6 months and doing well. I do not sell ALL my btcs at once, that would be stupid. I am holding some for the long run while I trade the other part to make more money. These are currencies dude, you can trade em exacly as you trade in forex, it just seems that people still dont understand that and use btc as a stock (but hey as long as it continues to go up its good too)

Why is there so much negativity in reddit, like seriously do you guys know that there is people who trade forex, stocks, bonds, etc for a living? And do you know it is not simply based on ohhh i think this will happen, but there are tools, systems to do it?
I guess not.

You are right and you will be downvoted because of it.
I am lucky I sold  before this bullshit started, but I really feel bad for the people who are just watching this bullshit without being able to make a sell.  Many times we have told this, but we get downvoted in this "to the moon" subreddit, BTC is being hardly manipulated and MTGOX is really doing it heavily right now. 
At the end, once the data is out we will end up having a sub $600 price or less and they will have no money to pay those who want out. If it wasnt a bubble, pyramid or whatever before, they just made it that because of this manipulation.

I am too lazy but please google "bitcoin killers". The amount of btc they hold is insane, if any of them decide to take profit tomorrow (sell) your btc will crash. Thats why holding is a bad idea, if you are trading the btc you are making a lot of money every day with these swings but if you are holding you are just waiting for one of them to take your money.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:13:56

@_date: 2013-11-27 15:52:09
Well, not according to my analysis dude..
Sure it can happen that I am wrong but well thats why I mention several different scenarios. I already made profit today with this very same system. And sure it could happen that I end buying at a higher price, thats trading. I set myself a target everyday a stoploss and a takeprofit, same as I do in forex....only that in btc you get a lot more money.
The scenario I mention shows the price droping to that, so I think you are wrong, there will be a price correction today. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:18:51
Well dude I wouldnt sell at all if your goal is a long term investment. Look I am all for the idea that btc will continue rising, so please dont sell :) I am only trading 40% of my total bitcoins because I am convinced it will continue to go up and this also what currently the analysis shows. This was just meant for the people who are trading the bitcoin and not just holding it so they can take advantage of the price drops and so on. 
You should look into buying some litecoins now that they are cheap while you just hold your btcs!
If you are not daytrading bitcoins please igore my sell hint! My aim for 2014 is btc price over $1600. I dont think we will see any BIG crash, as people like to call it. I call it price corrections. 
The next big event in bitcoin will be when it hits parity with gold price. This will decide a lot of what will happen in the future
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:47:57
Well don't get me wrong...I would LOVE to see it happen, but it wont and it would be dumb for them to actually replace their currency with BTC considering BTC is an internet based currency so people need ...you know...internet access and sadly not many people in that island have it. So as I said it is just another deluded thread :(
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:29:08
It is bad for the BTC community, it is just that the bitcoin community don't accept anything that is negative towards bitcoin, no criticism, hell they even turn BAD news like China´s statement into good news because that is what deluded people do, and trust me 99% of the people in THIS subreddit are deluded, r/bitcoinmarkets  actually has decent smart people in case you wanna check that out. 
I don't think this will happen in  the US, but they will eventually come up with their set of regulations as well, I cant guess what those will be. 
At least in China what you say  "you can't sell your stuff for bitcoins" , is exactly what the government said. 
If BTC would ever become a threat to the their plans with the yuan they should would ban it, it is unlikely but they would, after all it is a totalitarian regime ;)

I can be more specific then :) , new high today: $1024-$1030 , will bounce back to $920-$900, here I buy again. Will stay under $1000 for at least 3 more days after that and then  it will go over it again aaand thats what I got so far (in 2 days can throw new predictions) , as more data comes I will post more. Now THIS is a guess: Once it goes over $1000 the 2nd time I am afraid it won't look back. The next big event after that will be to see what happens when it hits gold parity (1btc 1 ounce  ofc), which I can´t comment on right now.

:) Then again, buy some litecoins, just take a look at the daily % increase, daily % market cap increase, daily %volume traded increase..it is very similar to btc growth. Is just that people here seem to "hate" on any1 that says litecoin  because they are in love with bitcoin or smth but people seem to fail to understand that the innovation are the cryptocurrencies not bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:08:07
Not according to my analysis !
Sure you can hold them and they will rise in value, but you can take advantage of the price drops as well. I am doing both, trading some btc and holding some for the long run. Same as I am doing with litecoin. Same as I do in forex (trade some currencies and hold 1 main one in a bank account). 
Please dont call it foolish :(  its basic trading , people in this subreddit dont seem to see that these are currencies and can be traded as such! Good luck!

Honestly not surprised to see this subreddit getting so obviously trolled. People here are dumb and keep amazing me more everyday.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:29:42
Dont try to post this here , you will just get downvoted and called an idiot. Try in @_date: 2013-11-28 13:59:57
I hope you are not THAT  guy  :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:01:02
yes there is a subreddit called bitcoin begging or smethi ng like that
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:14:37
No you are not wrong, and not the only one staring at bitcoinity :)
I usually see the highest volumes traded at this time and it basically defines what will happen tomorrow during the european and american times. I am afraid we will see it break the gold value within days or maybe even tomorrow. I said I am "afraid" but I mean..it will be a big day for bitcoin to see what happens when it hits gold parity (per ounce)
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:33:25
So you probably fell for it and had to search if it was real or not and then came here to say "those" who believe a troll are stupid xd  funneh!
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:12:03
I am not going to read -another- INTERPRETATION..... please what I quoted is from the oficial statement (I am also not interested in what LEE said, I did read the fucking statement in chinese so...), you dont have to interpret anything that is clear as water (read those 3 bullet points) , this is the problem here, people want to hear good news over bad news so they do whatever and interpret a statement the way they want it to be, not the way IT IS.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:55:19
Everyones in for the moneeyyyyyyyyyy. But ye they wont admit it, or will tell a cool fucking story  but at the end this is just money.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:40:20
Who really cares about how confused people are? Those who dont want to see the change or understand it can be left behind. Honestly, it is stupid NOT to buy litecoins now that they are SO cheap. I think you shouldn't get in love with bitcoin just because it was the 1st one, who says they cant co-exist? Its the same as fiat currencies...we have MANY...so we can also have MANY cryptocurrencies without a problem. And hey, investing in litecoin is a good deal right now and so you know the most common method to buy litecoin is using bitcoins..so its a win-win.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:32:08
It is very clear now IMO. Good job
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:37:54
none? Same system I use to trade EUR/USD and other currencies in forex...
Why people in this subreddit think you cant succesfully trade btc and litecoin using the same tools as in the forex market?
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:18:14
In forex we measure our systems sucess using myfxbook
If there is something like that fore bitcoins  please anyone let me know and I will post my data.
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:46:27
Short: Banks and merchants can't have anything to do with btcs. Individuals can still trade (buy/sell) bitcoins
Long: But considering their banks won't let them use their accounts for it then they have to find new ways or get off the market (today's crash). So what they did will harm bitcoin's growth, at least in China , which is a pretty massive market in terms of volume.
This has a lot to do with the govenrment´s plans regarding the yuan.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:44:15
I think you are trolling me but I will bite anyways. 
People without much opportunities, like those who are born in poor families, no education, no home, they gotta live in shelters, they wont get a job they cant even take a shower or get a meal. You are aware that there are millions of people living on the streets, not only in 3rd world countries but also in the US or pretty much any country in Europe, who dont give a single fuck about bitcoin because they  dont even have money, they dont even have a fucking house. No opportunities: They were born poor , children of people who had no home so were born homeless, no money really no education possible unless they get some kind of government help which is not common in places like India, where many here think its the perfect place for BTC adoption but they are deluded. Half the population in India live with less than a dollar per day, no home, no cellphone, no food, no internet, no computer and I can assure you that they dont give a single fuck about btc and they wont because when you are homeless your priority is to survive not to invest in internet money, so again, this whole analysis from the guy who posted is dead wrong, lacks real analysis, real numbers and a LOT of common sense. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:42:13
mtgox for btc and btc-e for litecoin. 
But I wont recommend btc-e as it sucks, just havent got the time to find something better :(
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:18:46
Nice argument! ehmm  not !
Here some1 already explained it in better words, if you want the link to the actual topic lemme know, it has some nice stuff you could learn instead of being one of this dumb "to the moon" guys.
"The volatility is due to the market still being very young and very small. The market cap of bitcoin (the value of all bitcoins currently in existence) is only about 12 billion USD right now. For comparison, the amount of US dollars in existence is in the trillions. Right now it only takes a buy or sell order of a couple million USD to move the price of bitcoin about +/-$100. If each bitcoin was worth 10,000 instead of 1,000 this $2 million order would only move the price on the order of $10 which would represent a much smaller movement as a percentage of price (100/1000 vs 10/10000). As the value of bitcoin increases, it will necessarily become less volatile."
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:52:09
This guy lies, its down,  you dont have to trust me or anyone just check what uder dontera said.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:36:47
How do you know he already knows how to move his btcs from one exchange to another?
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:51:17
Please how do people in this sub manage to put their heads on the hole and ignore what was really announced? They didnt create a new sector, this is a cool story nothing else. The official statement doesnt say that so it is not "great news" please stop with this deluded shit seriously.
@_date: 2013-12-24 16:20:23
hahahahah XD , honestly, cant wait for the positive "interpretations" in this sub followed by another ban, ehem china..
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:54:17
"everyone knows" 
Well I hope so. Because all you read here is that it CANT be manipulated while that is bs.
At the current price it takes 1 million to make a $100 price change, that kind of money is NOTHING for the ultra rich. Sure it will get harder, as the price grows, it will still be easy for those guys with tons of money.
Also remember, some people here say it takes like 6 months to get money out of mtgox for example, if a crash happened you are basically fucked. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 09:29:00
Really awesome, this is the kind of stuff that cryptos need to take off,  I have applied for an account, I really hope I get the invite ! I am interested in bringing this to south america as there is a lack of BTC platforms and information there !
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:06:45
Easy way to prove your claims, post your wallet info and sent the minimal amount possible to a charity or whatever you want including a public message with your reddit nickname. Ok mr.millionaire?  I guess you wont :( because you are just another deluded kid making stories in this sub.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:32:55
screams scam tho :...  :(
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:33:51
And they probably also have a lot other accounts which they use to speculate. These guys arent dumb and wouldnt only hae 1 account that is public to everyone to see what they do or dont.
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:20:15
I agree,  if you want bitcoins RIGHT NOW and you then proceed to make a wallet, then sign in to an exchange and want to buy them you cant. You need to wait a week to get verified if you are lucky and then you can buy, kraken is pretty good after you get verified. If you really want bitcoins like in less than a couple of hours you will need to pay some damn fees, in this case and if you dotn mind the fees you could try virwox ..so you basically buy linden dollars and then buy bitcoins with those, but you end up buying expensive bitcoins due to fees...but if you are in for the long term I guess that could not matter that much, and the other option is localbitcoins using local bank deposit, instead of cash/person buy. I am hoping we see some pretty-damn-easy-and-fast  exchange in the future. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:08:39

@_date: 2013-11-27 19:39:46
Never claimed to be better than 90% of people here. I was just starting a bit of a tradingishhh talk here considering I only see "HOLD , HOLD, HOLD" In this subreddit and no1 really seems to be trading the bitcoin.
I been trading forex for over 3 years now. Btc for 6 months and litecoins for under a month. Using a forex system I use for EUR/USD and USD/JPY  with some modifications. I fail to see any post here indicating me that people is daytrading the btc so I wanted to post with my predictions. 
Posting your predictions every day is very common in the forex markets, not sure why it cant be done here as well, after all we are talking about currencies here , arent we?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:21:20
Yep and that sucks because once the lag is over we will see a new massive drop (which already happened) but it is just not showing atm.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:04:15
  Just hold.
Am poppin the champaigne once it hits $1000

@_date: 2013-12-07 19:03:49
It depends on what exchange you use I guess, as far as I remember BTC-e  has a withdrawal option directly to paypal but they charge like a $7 fee or something like that. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:11:25
no clue what you are talking about now little nerd, but you should go to school instead

what are you waiting to fill it ? :D
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:28:10
No, the official statement was a couple of weeks ago and it was pretty clear about the policy regarding BTC, people here just "interpreted" the statement to what they wanted to hear while ignoring the facts. What we saw about btc china is just another consecuence of that statement, it wasnt any unsubstantiated rumor. 
I also didnt know your "point" was that reddit or china cant kill bitcoin, sure they cant man, but china banning btc hinder its growth, wether you like it or not
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:53:07
I called him that because he called "the readers" a bunch of noobs while he was stating a dumb point using the typical "I am in bitcoin since the beggining" as an argument.....
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:51:28
"I don't believe anyone has ever said the market cannot be manipulated."
Wrong, thats actually one of the main arguments you get to read about bitcoin "true free market" "free of manipulation" ...god its even on the side bar xd
Also the mechanism cant be manipulated? Thats another lie that is thrown here as a fact. Please do your homework, I will help you, google "selfish mining attack"  you might get an idea of what I am talking about, if you still dont understand it , let me know!
Aand by the way , you just proved that this sub does not tolerate any criticism. Already gave 2 valid points and your bogus arguments make me laugh, as well as the downvotes.

Talk to me when you graduate from highschool. You just posted stupid shit and misinformation and I told you so then you started posting more nonsense. As I said you are just another deluded kid from "You are irrelevant" hahaha damn you are so sad, didn't you say that exchanges are also irrelevant for bitcoin? Yea you did, you know why? Because you are very stupid kid, you should start learning from people who actually know about this subject instead of claiming you know shit and acting like a 12 year old libertarian.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:00:06
lol let them call us litecoins fanboys while we make profit out of it. I bought litecoins for $12.
The right thing to do is to have btc and ltc right now. If something else looks pomising I will also invest in that.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:18:33
Anyone willing to test it to see if it is not another scam?
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:29:40


This is what everyone is doing, dont fool youself. You want the price of btc to go up a lot so you can sell them and make a profit in dollars. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:05:55
Is that your argument? wow seriously I expected dumb replies but common thats going too far!
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:08:55
I pretty much nailed the prediction idiot and made money with it, so yep , again, go flip burgers while I daytrade
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:55:06
you will never see sub 800 imo.
Prices are far from being mature or stablized yet. Btc is not yet mainstream, when it becomes mainsrtream we will see some more crazy with the value and volume.
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:11:12
Very well put. You are right on your second point, they have nothing to gain and as of now it is just a theory but it could happen. The thing is that a selfish mining attack would be caused by "malicious" miners so they would probably do it just for the sake of doing it  (just like hackers hack websites sometimes just to prove they are unsecure, feel me?) 
On your first point(I am sorry I started with the 2nd one), wouldnt the market cap be dramatically reduced if those big players decide to step out? Sure a lot of new people would buy at the low price , but probably other ultra rich investors would do as well and what if it just becomes a cycle where rich people buy , wait until it hits an all time high and crash the market again? This is a solid concern. If that happened all the nice stuff of bitcoin would be put in shadows due to the get-rich-scheme going on.
I guess I was wrong about the confirmation times, thanks for clarifying that for me.
DDOS attacks will happen even if a lot of money is put into the infrastructure, it is basically impossible (as far as I know) to prevent one of these attacks, even some of the biggest companies out there have suffered them (some I can remember, visa, playstation network..,google for a few minutes) something needs to be done that when a ddos attacks happens it wont serve as a tool for some to manipulate the market while x site is down otherwise hackers with trading skills could abuse this easily to make profit.
I like the way you put it tho, rome wasnt built in one day indeed, but rome finally collapsed :P 
What do you think of alt coins? What I think could most likely happen is that if bitcoin crashes big time, it will loose its credibility and  a better-built altcoin will take over with time, some sort myspace-&gt;facebook analogy.
I like however the way you think of it  and hell I do, too, believe cryptocurrencies are the new era financial revolution, something we will be using in the next 10-20 years as we use the internet nowdays. I just doubt that that  means the price of a btc will go to the moon and replace every currency  :)
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:47:09
Indeed! But is not always the case. 
Today was something different as we had the $1000 broken. Next big thing is $1250ish as it is the current value of an ounce of gold.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:09:09
Nop. Simply dont buy bitcoins using paypal dude, you will get scammed as the transaction can be reversed, so you will be left with no btc and no USd.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:44:15
I am no code expert but as far as my understanding of cryptos goes, it would be impossible because they use different confirmation chains and cryptography...would have to "merge" to have a unique-wallet , if you think is not impossible please say why dont just say it ;)
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:59:16
what xd??

Use localbitcoins , cash?
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:30:38
Currently bitcoin is an investment, but since there is a new industry developing around it, eventually it will be used as a currency a lot more, as the market gets more mature the prices will stabilize. Bitcoin is already succesfull..it will continue to be developed. Take a look at current market cap and its potential.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:23:38
First of all, you will get downvoted hard.
Most of what you said is true except for "they can be printed/mined by anyone" , this is no longer possible because of the difficulty level, but assuming you are talking about some ultra-rich person capable of buying a ton of dedicated miners, then you are right.
All that said, I own bitcoins, I trade them on a daily basis and they are currently an awesome way to make money in the short term IF you trade them daily. If you hold them you are just waiting to lose your money. (big holders could simply sell today and take profit and the value would crash)
These views are not popular in this sub, but that being said:
To the moon!!! ┗(°0°)┛
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:33:50
Funny thing is that it is NOT mainstream at all right now! It has a lot of potential for 2014, as well as litecoin, dont forget to get yourself some litecoins too now that they cheap..
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:41:39
You could do the same with litecoin or any other smaller crypto if your goal is to hold and make profit. I know people here think bitcoin will go "to the moon" to $10.000 or even a million whatever, dreaming is free. These cryptos are a good way to make money in the short term, any fx trader knows this.

What makes you think they havent done it already?
As you said it was a lot easier to manipulate in march, they probably did it and thats why we have the current price. My whole point is that the argument that btc is the perfect currency because it "cant be manipulated" is just delusional. It is the perfect tool for the ultra rich to make a ton of money in minutes. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:13:46
Quite well with what you are doing? What is that , I have no clue what you are doing idiot.
Trading is not a gamble, see this is why I keep calling you dumb. Do you realize there are millions of people who trade forex, stocks, bonds, etc and now bitcoins for a living? One day I hope you understand that you can study the markets and make smart trades. But for you that is a gamble so well...you are dumb boy, go to school!

$1073 now,  considering it just broke every possible scenario I did for today I will simply not trade more today, unless it bounces back to what I expected or there is a decent price correcion. I took profit on my sale at $1024, now we have new data to make more scenarios, new enrty points, new targets, new stop loses new take profits. 
Sorry I kinda didnt understand your "spook" question very well :( 
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:26:52
Yes it is always nice to see what other people think about the current high price. However, most of the "crash" posts start with "this is a bubble" "tulip" etc and it is kinda annoying that no real argument is used.

good joke, I guess you are just another deluded to the moon idiot. Head over to @_date: 2013-12-23 16:17:58
I don't think you understood what I said, I been trading forex for over 5 years and I have never had a problem with an exchange, because I use reputable/respected one with security, in 6 months in bitcoin I have done the same,  I wouldn't put my money for example in an exchange like this one (screams scam) , even less after what you replied to me.
tl;dr scam is scam and you are a scammer
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:19:24

Perhaps you should listen to them (those who sold and took profit) and actually trade the currency instead of holding it like a dumb deluded idiot. While you hold they already sold and can re-enter the market with profit at any point, while.....you hold....

**6 and a half billion people on this planet have no connection to the world of money**
Such a dumb analysis, you started sort of well and then went full retard.
So just to start ....you included ALL THE FUCKING kids in the world in your numbers, those &lt;1 year olds, 2 year olds, ....12y...14y...../etc
Why do you even count a newborn baby in this analysis? That makes it really dumb, ohhh ye so many babies in the world dont have access to banking! -.-
Probably the proper age when teens start using or should start using banking(its unclear to me) , like a savings account if any is around , but it sounds about right to assume yor parents can open a savings account for you at the age of what 10? 12? Even so you included all those assuming they are financially independent or have the need to SEND money to other kids/people around the globe....so well I stopped reading your "to the moon" analysis considering all that shit is dumb and wrong k.
I agree with you that bitcoin is a huge invention but dont fool yourself wth these sort of numbers and the fact that this is upvoted to the front of doesn't surprise me at all since most of the people here are dumb and deluded. bibuy!
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:47:19
You forgot that China is a totalitarian regime, is not like in the US. Banks and merchans in China cant accept any bitcoin trades anymore, for them its illegal. Individuals can still trade bitcoins, but not using their chinese bank accounts.
Also I think you have no clue of what happened in China, really, but let me explain you. They said bitcoin has no legal stand point, that is the totalitarian government saying bitcoin is now illegal. All the merchants that were accepting bitcoins in China have now stopped doing so. 
I will also remind you that China has a very aggresive plan to make the yuan a very solid currency, so they wont let any cryptocurrency take off and damage their long term plans. China is currently the biggest US dollar holder in the world, but they changed just this month ther currency policy and they are no longer expanding their USD reserves, because of what they want to achieve with the yuan. 
You are ignoring a lot of factors in your analysis, so what YOU are saying makes no sense.

oh rlly? Please guys define what long term is for you, because with this volatility long term could mean 1 week, could mean 1 month could mean 1 year. 
In stocks long term: 3-5 years. But that is an already mature market, so until bitcoin reaches a decent market cap, there is no such thing as long or short term defined. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:30:27

I would love to share my btc profits, in forex we use a thing called "myfxbook" (you can google it) to share our performance, but in btc there is no such (yet) , at least that I am aware of .
I wasnt "self back patting" , I was answering to the whine and bogus arguments saying that there is no such as a succesfull trading system

They all are different markets, simply use the price of the exchange you use. Example I use mtgox so I just go by that price.

There are a lot of chinese investors with money in BTC right now, we saw last week 1 of a few crashes that we will see because of the ban, imo, since I dont think they ALL decided to sell at the same time. They will do it at a peak then wait and do it again, they wont sell all their btc at the same time as the other investors so more -crashes- are still to come due to this ban , in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:02:15
Dunno but BTC china is down..

Ah yea I get it. Well that is how a trading system works, You aim to have more profitable trades than losers, which so far is my case. 
I just wanted to point out that people here in reddit think that you cant use forex trading tools and apply them to btc and litecoin trading. 
You say technical analysys , they say flip a coin... 
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:04:41
When I said 2009 I made a mistake yes, what I meant was if you bought cheap. Now if you bought this year , say at $100?( You tell me)  and you didnt take profit yet well you are just dumb. Keep holding and wait the price to go "to the moon!".
I also bought this year and I already took profit , now I am trading on profits. Holding is dumb, call me inexperienced I care so much..., you dont have to be "glued for hours" watching charts, you can pick a time of the day to trade and do it for 1 hour and make profit with the current manipulated swings.
Those who bought early , like you can be happy if they take profit now.

China is irrelevant? So basically the biggest bitcoin market declaring bitcoin illegal is somehow irrelevant for you?
Did you even consider the possibility that some other countries could do the same? No?  What if it becomes a trend? &gt;Bitcoin would lose its value and boom your nice story goes to the floor.
Your analysis is very wrong sir.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:04:16
uh? so you are just holding while it goes up..good.
I am talking about daytrading the btc. I dont think you understood what I wrote.

Yes I do have a system to trade in forex and in bitcoin and I have been doing this for 5 years with profit, how is that funny boy? Because you havent even finished highschool and dont know shit about anything?  Hahahah wow, I really enjoy your "comebacks" , for a moment I was feeling bad for you because some guy here told me I was going to hard on you but well you keep going and you keep posting stupid shit so here goes again, you are a dumb little deluded kid and you are very mad because you got caught posting lies and stupid nonsense shit and now you wont get over it , b00m bye bye kid!

Bitcoin has already failed several times already...
Never said I was scared of the volatility, this is exactly why it is a dream for a trader. Now holding without taking profit and waiting the price to go to the moon is just dumb, and that is what many are doing here.  What makes you think next time bitcoin crashes people wont just buy litecoin or bbq or any other crypto, or simply not buy at all because they had enough?
People here need to stop thinking that it is a fact btc will go up forever.

@_date: 2013-11-27 00:49:21
It depends where you bought them. So simply go by the price of  your bitcoin exchange. I only look at mtgox because thats where I bought them.

Dont think it too much, $200 is perfect. Just buy very soon because it is going to break $1000 and then you will regret not buying!
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:31:47
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:39:32
Yes they are manipulating the BTC price. There was a massive sell going on, so to avoid it going any lower they basically "crash" their servers to show that as lag in the charts. We probably have a price of around 600 or less but it is so manipulated that I doubt we will see it. 
That makes it a proper pyramid now, there will be a moment when people want out and there will be not enough money to pay them because of what they are doing with this manipulation right now. 
This exchange is rigged. Sorry !
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:15:22
nice try :P bye bye ! scam
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:32:03
Because when you invest in something you dont want to hear anything negative about it, you want everyone to tell you how nice it is and how awesome your investment was.....until it crashes and you have to hide or pretend you sold. See below, I posted a legitimate fact/criticism about btc and all I got as an anwer was "check your math", nothing else. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:35:26
also forex= 24/5  while bitcoin = 24/7 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:13:32
It doesnt matter! Even if it crashes to $0 people here will say , so what? I will buyyy moreee yeyeyeye 
People in this sub are deluded, when a person is deluded you cant argue with them.
Just look at the comments xd
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:21:29
Why dont you just buy it and actually trade it like a smart person instead of buying and holding -forever- like 99% of the idiots in this sub so you can actually make some profit?
Learn some basic trading, technical analysis , choose a day of the week to trade if you are very busy (or more if you have time), choose a time frame, do your homework (analysis) and set yourself an entry point, a take profit and a stop loss for that time frame. When you are done, sell and go to sleep, unlike the idiots here who are just hoarding and basically assuming the price will go up forever in a volatile market that runs 24/7.
Do it this way and you can make a lot of money from this "currency" while again, those holding gain nothing. It is never late to start, you can start today or in 3 weeks, the principle is the same. Now if you want to buy 1 btc (current price $700) and hold "for the long term" like idiots here, and if perhaps maaaaybe the price ever goes up to what, $1500 whatever? you made 800 bucks...well for me it is just wasting your time. Bitcoin is being used by traders and speculators to make millions every day because of the current volatilty, this will be over eventually when the market cap grows , if it does, and the market becomes more mature, prices will stabilize and it will be just like trading any other currency where you have to make 40 oo 50 trades a week to make what you can currently make with 3-4 trades in bitcoin.
Be smart, dont listen to the hoarder idiots in this sub, they are deluded because they once heard that bitcoin COULD be worth 1 million so they think they will get rich by holding 0.5 or 00..5055757750858978 bitcoins for x years.. it is laughable.
@_date: 2013-12-19 03:53:13
I agree with this, also I think memes and "funny" stuff shouldnt be banned like they have now because lets face it, this sub has so many subs just because of it, if people actually want smart and true conversations they go to bitcoinmarkets or specialized forums,.....not reddit lol. reddit is for fun and I think the tothemoon guy is a very nice touch.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:37:44
Holding is also good dude. But analysis is not garbage :( after all this is how I been making money for the last 3 years in forex markets, last 6 months in btc and past month with litecoin.  
I am holding 60% or so of my total bitcoins for the long run , while trading the rest so I can make more money.  This is for me a part-time job.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:40:56
I am a daytrader. I havent looked at the protocol or the paper you mentioned. That being said, bitcoin has suffered several attacks, the one you just see as theorical has already happened, in a little scale, but happened. DDOS attacks have also happaned, most recent one a few days ago to one of the biggest exchanges in china.  All I am saying is btc is not perfect as people in this sub like to believe. It is easily manipulated and very vulnerable. These things have already happened and many more, but all you people want to see in this sub is:

Oh here comes grammar nazi , when arguments lack,  stupid people come up witht his shit, let me remind you that I dont come to reddit to write A essays, so deal with it, I also dont put any effort when replying to you since you just say dumb shit over and over again, seriously look at what you write little moron kid, you said no exchanges, you used one, you said no banks, you used one, you say exchanges are not needed for bitcoin to succeed = you are fucking dumb. 
We will find out what in 10 years stupid idiot? Exchanges are there, so people will continue to use exchanges to buy and sell bitcoins, I am amazed that you cant understand this.  "Do you know how currency operates?" hahah do you?? You are just another deluded kid from this sub, I know its hard to accept it, but you are one. Look at all your responses, you are fucking deluded and you are dumb. Go ask that kid that cuts your lawn about money he probably knows more than you.

hahahaha exactly 1000%? Wow mr.millionaire that is such a nice round number. No but really cool fucking story idiot. Also , guys like me? What? I day trade bitcoins and 2 pairs in the forex market, I know how to trade and sure I would sold at $20 if that meant profit. I know you are one of these kids that wished sooo bad to have bought 500 or 10000 bitcoins when they were worth pennies and hold them until today and boom rich, but you are not a millionaire, you are just a kid with a cool story. On the other hand, you got me , who have been trading the bitcoin for over 6 months and made profit by selling, buying, selling, buying using a system based on technical analysis on a 3 hour time frame and been profiting with it thanks to the huge volatility. Guys like me are making money while guys like you make cool stories about holding a bitcoin for 2 years, but go ahead deluded idiot. You can go ahead and tell yourself that shitty story again and believe it or actually grow up and realize that not everyone in this sub are deluded idiots like you.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:34:28
Its price would increase, so? I am poiting exactly that, one of the things you crazy btc guys say is that this currency cant be manipulated so it is perfect, when that is a lie and the ultra-rich are already doing it.. but go ahead be naive!
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:26:56
Well they gave zuckerberg a coding job which he took and then they told him about the facebook so he could code it for them but he simply stole it and ignored them after, thats why he got sued by them and he had to pay them. I am sorry but this kid suckerberg just stole an idea and got "rich" with it. I think the twins came out saying that about bitcoin because they are trying to make some sort of exchange, so they need some media attention, not because they are attention-whores but because it will be good for their business, they are business men after all..
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:40:38
l0l stfu stupid little kid. I do know how bitcoin works, you seem to be really dumb, so you bought one of your MANY bitcoins using coinbase......you know....an exchange.........   "No banks involved" .......I cant decide yet if you are just dumb or seriously dumb, you used coinbase (an exchange) that uses american BANK accounts as funding options. I think you need to read what you are fucking saying , because you make no sense , on your last reply you said we shouldnt use exchanges, but you use one, then you said no banks involved but you used coinbase to buy one of your MANYYYY bitcoins. Do I have to tell you that I am a forex day trader that happens to also trade btc , I know a lot more about this shit than you do and your replies are so stupid that I should just stop wasting my time writting to you. You probably dont even have a full bitcoin and you are also probably another 16 year old deluded kid that got his brain washed by this stupid subreddit called aka I am eager to see you next dumb reply dummy boy.
edit: and also  good luck "creating" bitcoins for yourself by mining. Maybe YOU have to re-read the sidebar and realize that mining is no longer profitable for the average joe, unless you own a ton of dedicated servers with a lot of hash power you wont see a dime and I doubt you are even mining or are part of any mining pool. If you want further explanation you could stop acting like you know shit and actually start learning boy.

If it is sooo easy to make an accurate prediction (like I did) , come on, tell me one right now for the next 3 hours of bitcoin, lets see?
I am sure you have no clue about technical analysis or how a trading system works, but I am all ears, lets see your predictions, do as I did please, tell me an entry-point, a target to take profit , a stop loss and a re-entry point and lets see how accurate you are ok?
And let me remind you again, that my prediction was far from being "weakass", as I pretty much nailed it and made profit with it, meanwhile you are crying like a kid in a forum.

@_date: 2013-11-27 17:07:07
I am already having fun. Both with btc and ltc. Profit on both.
This is where you are contradicting youself:
"Speculating on altcoins, in general, is pure greater fool theory in action"
As of right now, btc is also speculating, god you even say so and then contradict yourself. Your post is so wrong in so many things. I already pointed it out in your original post where you wrote this.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:48:41
Well I cant understand why people think this way about litecoin. To think that Bitcoin will be the only succesfull cryptocurrency is naive. As naive as it was to think that Btc wouldnt become succesfull a couple of years back.
Currently ALL cryptos are pure speculation, well you even said so and then contradicted yourself. 
People you need to understand that the INNOVATION HERE IS CRYPTOCCURENCY NOT BITCOIN. Btc was the 1st(sucessfull) one, that doesnt mean it will last forever or its perfect, dont be a fool. Just take a look at litecoin's market cap daily % increase....
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:16:33
funny how I was called an idiot when I sold today at $900 because that was a panic sell as well ...
People need to learn to fucking trade instead of hoarding like idiots "for the long term".
While you sit and enjoy the ride, there is a bunch of people making millions with these swings.
Deluded people here in this sub keep thinking that bitcoin will go up forever (to the moon!) but they never consider the other option that it could crash and lose all credibility and perhaps be replaced by something better. 
People spreading this "wait for the long term and you will be fine" bullshit are idiots.

@_date: 2013-12-17 10:53:56
it would only be a problem if they close exchanges, however people will always find a way an they are giving you an example...localbitcoins, so anyone who has a bitcoin or wants one will find a way and this is the whole point of this thread. They cannot shut down -BTC to CASH- "exchanges" remember bitcoin is meant to be a P2P currency, so any 3rd party is actually not supossed to be there yet it makes things much easier, but the essence of the currency cannot be controlled, which is p2p...
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:09:58
Its 0. Join a pool maybe you can get a fraction of a fraction of a btc with some time.. Honestly mining in btc is not rlly profitable for the average joe nowdays. But you could always mine litecoins, they are rising in value and it is still very profitable. Gl!
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:31:03

@_date: 2013-11-27 15:41:17
You can always just hold your  bitcoins for the long run, its good too, this was more meant for people who are trading btc and not holding. (note: I am trading part of my btcs but I also have some that I will never sell (at least for 2 more years))

yea dont worry guys, lets all ignore the fact that china declared it illegal and just tell our selves that is good news! Lets also just ignore the obvious down pattern and tell our selves it will go up to the mooN!  Lets also forget the fact that everytime there is a massive sell, all the major exchanges go into crash control and lag the market , but that is good news guys, we will be able to buy a lot of bitcoins soon and it will go up and we will all be rich, guys dont worry! &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;

@_date: 2013-11-27 15:09:06
is not a bubble dont be naive. If you are asking for a correction of the current price, I was thinking $1024 as high today with a bounce back to $920-920 range but considering the volume traded it might just hit $1050 today and bounce back to $850 where I think it will stabilize and continue with stedy growth.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:21:41
You are right but also you should define "crash" because I saw many posts today calling it a crash when the price got corrected after the $1073 all time high to $914. That is not a crash its a correction. 
I DO NOT SEE a crash coming anytime soon. (For me a crash right now would be a price under 600) 
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:09:18
they can easily sell it in localbitcoins for that amount tho
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:42:03
I was pretty close indeed, system is 73% of times right. I bought at the $920 again, and I am making tonight´s scenarios. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:59:42

Wouldnt put my money there, ever. Also this post shows that they only care when things go public, so fuck them.
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:29:01
I think we are pretty much over the crashes. I dont think there will be any big crash anymore. People who say that think we are in a bubble about to pop. They were calling it a bubble since it hit $30. How can it be a bubble when bitcoin is nowhere near being mainstream or "known" at all? Just seriously dont worry, you made the right choice. Also you wont be enjoying the ride if you are worried all the time, see it as an investment...

No. Even if you wanted there is a massive lag right now caused by the massive sells/crash. mtgox for example is trying to keep the price at a certain level by lagging their system to avoid that crash. The current price isnt nowhere near the real price.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:28:33
well I am sorry but deluded people need some "I told ya so" from time to time, look you were saying it was a lie with full confidence and all based on what? Bet you didnt even read the statement...this is why I have to say this to deluded peeps.
"Exchanges just muddy the water" ?? wow man, honestly go away with this deluded stuff you spray , without exchanges btc is worthless, please tell me, honestly, without exchanges how do you get your btcs kK? Wanna see some more deluded answers
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:14:12
25m lag on mtgox, just shows how weak and manipulated bitcoin is. This happens everytime to stop a massive crash but they can only hold so much...
There is a massive sell going on right now , I aim at 600 prices. But  whatever you say in this subreddit is good news for bitcoin, if it goes down is good news, if the chinese ban it is good news, if..

I am just wondering, what online poker blockade are you referring to? I have been traveling a lot and been in what 10 or 12 different countries and never had a problem cashing in and out. Sure you could be talking about that country I forgot the name....land of freedoms and shit where you cant play online poker? hahah, well if it is the USA ofc! Land of freedoms but you cant even play online poker L0l.. 
Sorry but bitcoin is not comparable to online poker.
Also, people who want to play online poker simply use a vpn, I know because I play everyday with americans on pokerstars,888, etc that use canadian based vpns or any basically.

Sorry but this makes no sense. I dont expect to lose my money by putting it in an exchange, if I were to lose it would be because I did a bad trade or the price dropped so bad that my money would be worthless but NOT by putting it in an exchange.

Dude I am sorry but I am just going to stop replying to you, you clearly have no clue what being poor is. When you are poor and live on the streets, you have no opportunities, there are ways that some people become stable after living on the streets but those are 1 in a million cases, just go to the WHO and see how many people in the world live with less than 1 dollar per day, think for one second that you are one of those guys , living under a bridge, searching on the garbage to get some food to cease your hunger ....seriously with your dummie  questions man, really? Whats stopping them to get materias to build homes? What stops them to receive education? Opportunities? You might wanna see the world outside a bit more like it is, instead of just watching a computer screen, there are millions of people dieing every day because they lack clean water and you think their solution is bitcoin? Please you are way off and that is really really delusional. Bye

About India and Africa, I honestly dont see it happening. Why? Because well they have A LOT of other problems they need to fix before even investing in bitcoin or any crypto infrastructure. Africa is very poor, barely any technological advances, for them an internet based currency is useless as most of the population dont even have internet access, feel me? I dont really have a formed opinion on India, so I cant tell.

I am sorry, I didnt mean to offend you dad or anything. I am curious to know what your source to claim that only "0.001%" of daytraders make any profit? 
Probably this might be true for people without any financial education, but at least I went to college, had several and advanced forex education and been doing this for 5 years with profit (I didnt profit right when I started ofc but I am on profit now), I think if people take the time to learn and experience instead of watching other people do it, they might become successful. And I know several other people that make a living by trading forex (and now BTC) so I am not sure of that % , is all I am saying ;)
Sure most new traders cant make money, but some give up and some continue to do it and eventually become good traders.

Oh I am sorry if I sounded like a "bitcoin advocate" , I am not. I am an investor and I dont really get sentimental with my investments. That being said, calling the current price of btc a bubble just because it is high and people are getting more and more into is naive and it is a bad argument.
People fail to understand that there is a huge industry being created around bitcoin and cryptos in general, this will help with volatility and stabilization of the prices as there is more adoption. Also, I would like to see one of these guys calling btc a bubble say what they think the real value of a btc is, ok lets say it is a bubble, when it pops, what do you think the price will be? 
I am tired of people saying it is a bubble without saying what they think it is worth. They also call a price correction a "crash" but then they forget to describe what a "crash" is for them. What a 8% price drop is a crash now? ...
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:37:12
They "lag" the server to avoid the massive crash thats going on. BTC is easily manipulated as we can see right now. &gt;800BTC sell, &gt;700BTC, &gt;300sell but the price goes up... its silly what they are doing, eventually they will have no money to pay everyone if they keep sending false data just to keep a price "stable". The price could be at around 500 but they wont show it to avoid the panic sell that would cause..which already happened but its not showing, 45 min lag? That is just ridiculous and I dont know why deluded people here this is the perfect currency, when it is just speculator bubble being manipulated. 
But ignore all that  and to the moon!

Not sure how you guys here KNOW the price will just go up forever...let me remind you that you DONT KNOW, that is all. 
That being said, this time is different because China basically declared it -illegal- and most of the growth we saw in btc these past month was thanks to China. So I wouldnt be surprised if it doesnt go as well this time. 
Also I dont see how selling and taking profit now would make you silly. Not many smart nverstors here I see, just to the moon guys!
@_date: 2013-12-15 10:44:47
From the official chinese statement:
    *Chinese financial companies are NOT allowed to handle Bitcoin. This includes payment processors.
    *Merchants are NOT allowed to handle/receive Bitcoin for goods &amp; services.
    *Consumers can use Bitcoin at their own risk.
**Also hilarious that I get downvoted for telling the truth, I dont honestly care about my "internet points" so go ahead and smash that downvote button while you also ignore the facts and put your head in the hole**

Thats not what I predicted. I said we would hit over $1000 today, then gave a more detailed targets for take profit and re-entry point after the bounce. I predicted a $1024 high which would bounce to $920 but it was $1073 to $914, damn I am so stupid...
That is not how technical analysis works. If you are interested I can give you a noob link where you can read about the 3 types of analysis used in forex trading. 
I am not seing any other posts here with predicions with take-profit, stop loses, and re-entry points. Thats why I wanted to share my predictions.

Is not going to happen that venezuelans will jump into bitcoin. That is mainly because no1 really knows about bitcoin in Venezuela yet (well a few people do but you get it). They also have a lot of violence going on in the street going on right now and I think they are a little more worried about some other stuff like their lives and their safety other than the bolivar. What really is happening is that the venezuelan market is getting floded with black market dollars, so they are jumping in USD instead of bitcoin, which makes sense considering they have no clue about bitcoin.!

Indeed I was wrong but not entirely wrong, considering the upside of 2 scenarios were met. It is a system I took profit at my target and now I am making a new re-enrty point since the downside of the scenario didnt happen. I still think we will see a correction in the price today, just not as low as I said I guess. As we speak I am making new scenarios because thats how trading works ;) 
Yea the system and analysis has to be refined ! This growth is crazy.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:53:08
It is not nonsense , you cannot sell anything for bitcoins in China anymore....did you even read the report...?
**B2C Transactions: When China said bitcoins are not currency, they also meant that products can not be legally sold for bitcoins. Major retailers which were just beginning to accept BTC in China have now completely separated themselves from it. China was by far the leader in bitcoin B2C commerce, and they are now at the very bottom.**
To answer your question, they think its good news because this subrredit is deluded, so any criticism to bitcoin gets downvoted and any bad news are turned into good news. This usually happens because when idiots invest in something they get sentimental about it and dont want to hear anything negative towards their investment, while real investors are the opposite and see their investment as ....an investment (risk/benefit)

Well even if a government would ban bitcoin use/exchange and everything, history has showed that nothing good comes from prohibition. People here dont like to compare it to the 1930 alcohol prohibition in the US, but it is the same principle, if people want it (I want it even if it would get banned in my land) people will get it, if many people want it and there is a prohibiton, this will eventually have to fall. See alcohol, marihuana, tobacco, porn, illegal downloads, whatever you name it that has been banned if people wanted it people will find a way, and also please remember that we are living on the internet era, we are right now seeing things technologically that are insane, people wont be stopped over the internet, this has been proven many times with torrents, music, porn, I continue, an internet-based currency will not be stopped as it is INTERNET based and our generation is eager to explore whatever thats awesome on the internet. Even if they banned people could simply use  A VPN, and you dont have to be tech saavy or a genius to use one, there are stupid-easy services for this for a little fee/month so dont see why people here claim it would be like going to the black market of the internet to buy a btc in the future...it would only take a little-to-no-effort. Bans do nothing, and even less on the internet. 
I am not a deluded idiot , but I am just saying that even if it was to be banned people would still use it and it wouldnt be hard to exchange it.

Well bitcoin is currently ruled by traders and they were mainly from China. This crash are those chinese guys getting the fuck out because they basically declared bitcoin illegal in China. Sure, not "direcly" but people fail to understand that China is a totalitarian regime, if they say "perhaps bitcoins should not be accepted by merchants" it actually means "DONT fucking accept bitcoins or you will be fucked up by us the government".
Also people fail to see that China wants the yuan to become a very important currency in the Trading world, so they wont let an internet currency take off and ruin their long term plans. 
The times where the crashes happened also happen to be during Asia trading times, so it is pretty much obvious for anyone that speculators from China decided to leave.

Ok I have read your source and I still believe that 1% is not accurate at all, let me explain you why. If you take a look at myfxbook (this is where traders share progress in the forex market) you will find a lot more people that have been making money in forex. Also let me explain you why I think that that source is completely wrong, they are assuming that everyone that makes a trade is a trader (while this is technically true it is not at the same time) = I consider traders, people with financial education, forex education and experience in the market, while he is considering a trader any noob or newcomer that joins the market makes all the noob mistakes and whipes an account within a week. 
As I said mate, sure your numbers are right if you put everyone in the same pot and call them "traders" then yea probably only 1% of them make profit, but if you see real traders with education on the subject I can assure you that the number of profitable traders is much higher. One of the main noob mistakes in the forex market is to trade based on sentiment analysis (basically what most people in do), so this is why I am not at all surprised to see people here calling trading a gamble or luck, no offense but it is not like this. In my case, I started trading live 5 years ago but I was trading on demo 2 years before that while I was still in college. I whiped many demo accounts while testing strategies, systems, different analysis etc until I finally made some profit on demo, then switched to live and whiped my first account in less than a month ($1000 USD). I went demo again and changed my system, then made profit on it and went live again, whiped my 2nd live account in about 4 months this time (progress woo!)  (another $1000 to the trash) , this is when you either give up or continue learning, I decided to continue learning from my mistakes and went on demo again this time with a very nice risk management strategy and a lot more advanced tools of analysis thanks to a nice resource I found, and well I been making profit since then with my 3rd live account. Now since I found about bitcoins, well I have pretty much put on hold my trading in the FX market(but I have set a bot to do the trading for me)  because in the bitcoin market I can make 3-4 trades and get the same profit I make with 30-40 trades in the fx market, the risk is higher but so is the benefit.
e: I also dont consider myself very talented or lucky , just an average trader who had forex education in college 
and put a lot of effort in reading and understanding how this works until I found a system that fits my needs and makes more good trades than bad trades = profit.
If you are interested in successful systems you can directly check here   
I personally developed my own system which I converted into a bot (with help of a coder from a well known forum) to trade  EUR/USD and USD/JPY with my main account. But I have also a secondary account with milliondollarpips bot (which is profitable) and a 3rd account(my test account) with my  bot based on my system but with SUPER-HIGH risk and other slight modifications (which is currently losing me money)  and about 5 demo accounts testing different systems , all automated with bots. As I said since I jumped into bitcoin I have just left the fx market to the bots and I am manually trading the btc while developing a system that I want to turn into a bot for automated trading in btc, but this is still work in progress. It is not as hard and crazy as it seems to be able to make money by trading, I just think there are a lot of people who give up too quick and then call proper trading a gamble and this makes me a bit mad and sad at the same time :(
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:47:58
check kraken thats where we "day traders" are making the moneyz . It is kinda funny to see people making this sort of statements "Anyone sitting at home thinking they are going to make money day trading in the long term is mistaken"  when I have been doing this for 5 years with good results and been doing it in bitcoin market for 6 months with the very same system I use to trade EUR/USD and the USD/JPY with a 60% success rate so far. SO people here claiming that daytrading its a gamble and that it is impossible to make money with it. People claiming that lack a LOT of financial education.

wtf are you talking about deluded idiot, I am a daytrader,  while your noob advice is simply "buy never sell" mine is "trade btc".

While you hoard I have made profit. Noobs here amaze me.

@_date: 2013-12-06 20:07:08


Could have, would have. This is not how trading works, again. You set up a target, a stop loss and a take profit. If you hits your marks you are doing well. It is not a potential loss as you will re-enter the market anyways @ a new entry point. Sure it could have gone higher, but as a trader you need to avoid exactly that "would have, could have" or you will be regreting every single trade you make.
BTC has taken big hits sure, but take a look, 3 major exchanges suspended trading right now "lag", this is pure manipulation and a proper market cant have flaws like this. It is a bubble, you make make profit with bubbles but considering BTC a viable currency right now is deluded, because YOU WOULDNT BE ABLE TO SELL IT RIGHT NOW EVEN IF YOU WANTED. If it crashes to 0 you will have to just see it as a spectator because the rigged exchanged wont allow you to trade it. Its sad but its what is happening..
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:14:51
I am not yet releasing my system, but I will soon (not in reddit tho, here people think there is no such as succesfull fx traders). I am very active in certain forex forums, I can pm if you want. 
Basically is the same system I use to trade forex, mainly EUR/USD and USD/JPY   but adjusted to  btc and ltc. It is a work in progress. 
You make 4 -most likely- scenarios for a day , based on technical analysis (charts and indicators)  and you stick to the one you choose. I am making new scenarios right now for tonight´s trading and tomorrow morning. I will not publish it here I will simply throw a prediction. I can pm it to you tho (the analysis , not the system)

Hey. No you are not late, stop waiting and buy at least some.  
People asked this very same question when it hit $100 $250 $750 and now $975 (mtgox). 
I am selling now most of my bitcoins to buy my dream boat (thanks to bitcoins!&gt;!) but I am keeping some and I will buy more every month with part of my salary.
In my opinion it will definately go over $1000 in a couple of days (maybe tonight !)  and it will continue to rise in 2014. I am aiming to see a price of $1600 per bitcoin by the end of 2014 and over $2200 the year after. I don't think the current price is a bubble considering it hasnt gone "viral" yet. Just buy some and keep em for the long run. Good luck!

Yea this whole industry developing around bitcoin (and well cryptocurrencies) looks very promising for the future value of btc and ltc. Now that we are over $1000 , for me the next big thing will be when it hits the current gold price per ounce ($1250ish). What happens then will tell A LOT  about btc´s future. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:55:48
Well yea, that would be like I mentioned something similar to BTC-e where you can have like 8 different currencies if I am correct, but not in the sense of a "crypto-wallet" per se like I think OP meant.  But I think definately something web-based is possible and will be done in the near future.

-The market cap when the price was $256 was nothing compared to what it is now, so comparing that moment to the current one is pointless.
-People are watching yes, and people are reporting it. Mtgox is not a reliable exchange, people are aware of the price manipulation.
-At the current market cap it only takes a couple of million dollars to move the price  $100 up or down, so is not as hard as you make it to be. For the ultra rich this is pocket change.
-You call it correction but then you say no one knows the real value of btc, therefore you are contradicting yourself, please go read what a correction really is..then come back.
-Sure eeryone is speculating on btc, remember I posted against mtgox, one exchange not bitcoins. The current price shown in mtgox isnt real, they are maniulating the market, people cant get their money out, people cant trade during "lag" aka when there is a masive sell..
-You have to be blind not to see that everytime there is a big sell, they go into crash control.
-You claim that there is more people buying than selling, but the market seems to say otherwise, as you said, learn how market works.
-Mtgox bitcoins are a bubble because they inflate the price to avoid a crash, so right now it is working like a pyramid, once the guys on top sell guys on bottom will be fucked over (which you can already see happening when theer are massive sells and no one except the big accounts are able to make orders)
-All I am saying is based on logs that you can see yourself in blockchain.
All I am saying is that mtgox is not reliable and is making bitcoin look like a bubble poping, too bad you are some deluded idiot who dont want too see it....like most of the people in this sub.

@_date: 2013-12-01 17:58:22
Oh and I should waste my time with you ok...I will bite.
You seem to think that the innovation is bitcoin, but it is not, cryptocurrencies are.
"However, the promise of bitcoin, the infrastructure that is being developed to support it, the development process of the protocol itself, is what is interesting about bitcoin.
*Bitcoin is on its way to mass-adoption, and the reason why is because of all the VC's putting massive amounts into the development as i just mentioned. The force behind this revolution is ever-increasing, and as more and more products and ground-breaking functions are released within the immediate future, we will see price-surges accordingly. "*
There you go , pure assumptions. You just keep ignoring the fact that very few people hold MOST of the current bitcoins, they are rich and this is their CURRENT investment.
Sure it has potential, it also has the potential to be the next tulips, but hell no , lets not consider that option because libertarians much and open-minded much.
I am sorry I think I could do a better job replying to you, but In my experience it is pointless to try and tell deluded people that there is a chance their beloved bitcoin could fail and could become another useless attempt of currency.
All of you people buying bitcoins right now to hold are just dumb people giving your money to the rich and when they sell, and they will do,  you will have no time to even react. 
You keep assuming bitcoin is the future, ignore the problems, the manipulation, the scams and all the negative and focus on to the moon! For all we know litecoin has more potential than bitcoin, or any of the other cryptos, or they could all fail. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:27:39

I do trade bitcoins and there are reputable exchanges for that. I also didn't say anywhere that I STORE my bitcoins in an exchange, I do keep my bitcoins in my own paper wallet, but I still use the exchanges to TRADE. Is not really that hard to understand what I told you,  you said that any money you put into an exchange you should be willing to lose it and that makes no sense as I said I only expect to lose my money if I make a bad trade or a stupid desition but not just by putting money in an exchange to TRADE. I don't keep my money on the exchanges, I trade then withdraw, there are actually a few exchanges that have instant withdrawals so I don't really see what you mean by "none of the exchanges are insured in the case your money gets stolen". This, again, makes no sense. Also I wouldnt put my money in an exchange where the owner (aparently you) claims your money can get stolen at any point an puf gone, see this is why I keep calling you a scammer, dont expect me to be nice to a person that comes here to post this sort of nonsense. If you want to make an exchange, the first thing you need to provide is security, your site lacks some basic security feautures as some other people already stated in the comments above, there is also not a single hint of who runs this or who you are other than the who.is thing(which is pointless), if you are not a scammer take this as a feedback instead, you need to make people think you are reputable, secure, serious and reachable and 3 out of 4 of -those conditions- to use an exchange , for me, are not met. gl
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:15:25
Exactly. Thats how a system works,  you choose an entry-point , a target to take profit and a stop loss.A succesfull system has more positive trades than negative ones. Too hard to understand? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:15:08
well as of right NOW it is pure speculation, both bitcoin and litecoin (I dont think the other cryptocurrencies are worth mentioning) . Now that being said, there is a whole industry developing around bitcoin, so as time goes by we will only have more and more vendors who accept bitcoins as a payment option. There is still a long way to go until it is mainstream, that is why both bitcoin and litecoin are currently a good investment. I bought bitcoins and litecoins and for me the potential of those 2 are worth the risk.

I was expecting it to hit $1024 today but NOT SO FAST, we will see a correction soon no matter what, but IMO it will hold over $900-920  , lets see, 4th likely scenario if it boucnes hard will be $840. I will be buying anyways when it bounces
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:39:59
Yes buy some bitcoin at any price, then be ready to trade around 15:00 Cet, 19:00 cet or 23:30 Cet. You can make a lot of money many times during the swings that happen and those times, because people go crazy and buy at any price when it jumps to a new high and they sell at any price when it starts going down. You can do this until forever or until bitcoin crashes to 0. This is how average people can make money in btc, holding for the long run is just waiting to lose your money. 
It is not popular here if you say it will crash, but it will, not because I say so but because that will happen when the big players decide they want to sell and take profit and jump to the next crypto and do the same again, probably litecoin and then rinse and repeat.

@_date: 2013-12-17 10:59:07
Ye you need to provide a source for that statement, otherwise it is just your opinion. There is demand for bitcoins, sure if it would be declared illegal demand would drop but there would still be demand. Examples of using bitcoin as a currency? Well just think of anything you can do with cash and you can do it with bitcoin if both ends agree to use that currency. As an example, you can go to a Latinamerican country and use USD if they agree to accept it instead of their local currency, same could happen with btc. Remember it is meant to be a P2P currency, not a P2P-2-FIAT 
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:17:09
Yes it should do it and it should be today after the correction. One of my scenarios shows a bounce back to $900-$920 after the $1024 was hit. The other one shows a bounce back to $850 if it hits $1048 high. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:20:06
To the m00N!!!!!!!!!!!  
To answer your question: yes. 
The greater fool theory: 
Doesnt change the fact that you can still make a lot of money everyday with these cryptos until they crash ofc. As an example, I need to do 20 or 30 trades in the forex market (assuming at least 60% are succesfull ones) to make 20% of the profit I do in 3-4 trades (succesfull ones) in bitcoin or litecoin.
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:43:55

**Your just saying that they inherited their poverty from their parents. what is the REAL cause of poverty.**
You just gave one of the main causes of poverty. Now imagine this going on for generations and genereations. Other causes of poverty can be people going broke because of losing their jobs, debts, bad financial desitions, well there are many dude I am sure you know some too. In the beginning? HMmm There has been poverty , I would say, since people exchange goods for goods, or money/gold/coins/whatever for goods and those who had smarter ways to produce food could exchange more and have more things (they became richer) while some others didnt know how to do it so well (became poorer) and became slaves or did whatever to survive, I am talking around the feudal era, because thats where I think the biggest social gap started, not where poverty itself started but when the biggest amount of poor people came to light. Probably a history teacher is a better source than me.
And yea you cant just throw poor people food, that wont do much but if you give a complete help in the form of homes, education, opportunities, some people get out of poverty eventually.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:20:27
Ok so you are trading it. Now what is the matter with "it broke every possible scenario for today"? 
Did you have a scenario where it hit $1073? I really doubt it. My 1st most likely was $1024, 2nd price drop to $920, 3rd all time high $1047.  
Now I am working on a new re-entry point and new targets, just waiting for the price correction. Not sure what "pattern" are you talking about, since today was very different. And we didnt even get to talk about the volume, look at today´s volume..

I will explain it, but you can google as well "bitcoin killers".
Basically some ultra-rich people own tons of bitcoins, if one of them or all decided they want to take profit, they would sell their bitcoins, causing a massive crash in the price.
This will happen eventually as for them bitcoin is nothing else than a tool to make millions in the short term and they simply want USD. Not like the libertarians here claiming

I am sorry I might have mis-translated it or is not understandable, with that word I mean a coffee shop for example, they can't list the price of an expresso in BTC nor receive them as a payment, as well as clothing stores, etc etc 
They didnt ban speculation tho, so people can still use exchanges, but the ban basically affects the use of BTC as a currency an instead makes it more a commodity...which is not entirely bad but it is not what it was meant for.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:11:35
People here assume bitcoin will go up forever and ever and they will be rich, but there will be a moment when the big guys decide to sell and convert their tons and tons of bitcoins to dollars, because for them , unlike many libertarians, bitcoin is just one more tool to make a ton of money in the short term. When they sell it is over for bitcoin.

Just buy litecoins then, they are still cheap. I bought @ $12 now they are $30.

"Bitcoin is a specified virtual commodity, it does not have equal legal status with currency, and it cannot and should not be circulated as currency on the market." From the original statment.
This contradicts what you say in your post :
"In addition, by declaring Bitcoin a virtual commodity and placing its regulation under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), China hasn't burdened Bitcoin's growth with banking regulations and controls"
If you think this will not affect bitcoin´s growth in China, then again you are deluded, so I basically stopped reading there.

Yes I should have pointed out earlier that this sell hint was more meant for those daytrading the btc and not those holding it for the long term, my bad. 
Yea I am not going to wait forever hehe, because the price wont stay there forever, I just follow my scenarios, I adjust them as there is more data available and set new targets and more scenarios are made. 
You lose some and you win some. The idea of a trading system is to have the most profitable trades as possible, which as of now is where I stand. I am hesitating to post here my system as I have seen many people are very negative here :P and simply call trading a crystall ball lol...
But yes, holding is the best choice right now. But since I am a forex daytrader I have to sell and buy and sell and buy to see profit in the short term.

I sold at $1024 because that is what the system I use was  showing as the 1st most likely scenario. It ended up breaking that and going near the 3rd most likely scenario (all time high $1047) which hasnt happened yet. Sure I am hoping the price will go over $1300 eventually, that doesnt mean you cant trade in the meantime and make more money!   (I am trading part of my btc while I hold some untouched for the long run) 
Good luck!
