True, its now rare that I use coinbase, sometime when I'm on a fly and I see some good price and I want to spend just a lite. I usually do more a proper bank transfer. And more recently I bean more focus on growing my investment.

They charge you the fees for the transfer, probably not the best idea to transfer every 10$. Also with amount that small, I'm not sure investing in a trezor is the best, I'll personally prefer keeping investing in bitcoin and keeping my fews coins on a paper cold wallet.

Just calculate the trading fees pro and con.
I recall having calculated that on coinbase you where better to go by base of 50$ to pay the smallest amount of fees (already 4%). I mean if you can afford to wait 2-3 weeks and buy 1 time 50$, or build a reserve and try to time a low in price.

It will grow within time but the math are simple
X * 28'000'000 = Mc
As X is the price of a bitcoin

Yes most website/apps take up to a week to process the validation (and worst one will take even more)
The idea is to open a fews different one, the most comun for canadian are coinbase, coinsquare, quadrigacx.
For absolute immediate purchase there is still bitcoin ATM, but usually one that is fast for small amount is coinbase, and then more you want to invest big amount more it will take you time and/or personal id verification to get access to more serious deposit.

They still have to prove that the coin have some value, if they have to honor it 1 - 1 with there currency, the crypto market will value it in consequence (and actually probably harshly since bitcoin holder don't want a fedcoin so much) and on the fiat side it will devalue it even more, knowing that they create more money. Its a double edge sword and its all about how its done.
