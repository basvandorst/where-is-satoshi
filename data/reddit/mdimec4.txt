Tnx for your review, your points sound valid. 
Some further questions on the topic:
- why is increased block being postponed  for later when LN will be implemented in unknown future, while fees and slowness are hurting bitcoin now? I mean I know fork is needed to do this, but still. 
- They instead implemented Replace-by-fee which in some sense makes things worse, because  now if I am coffee shop owner and I sell you coffee I have to wait for transaction to be conformed otherwise I cant be sure that you wont steal me the minute u walk out by redirecting money back to your wallet with transaction with higher fee. I know coffee is bad example because of high fee prices.

Some people argue that LN will lead to centralization.
I am interested what are your thoughts on that?
Is it bad or good?

Blockstream Corporation doesn't own Bitcoin name, so it is technically not stealing.

Wow what generous  person.

I agree that things got ridiculous ;) and that people should be more focused on project and message than on name.
The fact is that most people mean Bitcoin Core when they say Bitcon. Exchanges list them under different names but new users probably get confused anyway.
And it is also the fact that the name is important trade mark and that both projects want a piece of it. This is why there is so much hatred from both sides.
However simply saying that one is stealing from another is false. 
Anyway nice discussing with you ;)

Hm. 
I say no court, but the future will tell which one is better. 
You don't get it. The beauty of open source is that a lot of people with different motives contribute to the project. 
After fork happens, two groups are equally entitled to the work done before fork.
The question is whats up your ass that you are so biased. I say I hope that the best win. I don't have particular bias apart from the fact that majority of my investment is  in bittcoin (core).
And that LN looks like mess contrary to the original idea.

No offense, but stupid comparison, it only shows that you don't understand what are you talking about.
Refer to my previous reply.

Naturaly it is. If you get two blockchais from what was before one this is a fork. And if you have then two source code branches this is also a fork.

There was no real consensus or there wouldn't be this discussion. Since there is no central authority, to decide, the thing becomes a topic of different perspectives? Both sides of view  trace back to the same root in blockchian. One side believes that it is more true to initial intention another that it has the majority if users (this can change).
I understand the new users confusion, and I could only advice that you need to get infirmed before any ivestment, and only then invest into currency that they like the most.

Let me tell you something new, There is also no  such coin called bcash.

Bad comparison that shows that you don't understand things.  Bitcoin is not a trademark and is not owned by nobody in particular. It is opensource software to which many people had contributed. But yet not single one of them should be able to claim the name. For example Gavin Anderson and some others  who were with Bitcoin from its early beginnings, they can't  claim bitcoin name as their own but they have right to use it. The same goes for Blockstream corporation. And no there is no reaon for confusion since the name "Bitcoin Cash" is clearly distinct from the name ”Bitcoin"

You can't declare it as deliberate misinterpretation, without proving that Blockstram co is the rightful owner of Bitcoin name first. There is simply no basis for that. Good luck with that in court.
