At a certain spread, people will find a way to use arbitrage to bring them closer in line. It is strange how large that spread has to get though.

If you’d be fine losing $16.5k cash right now, $3k is probably a good first investment, learn more for a few weeks and go from there. Don’t put everything you ultimately want to invest right away before you know better.
