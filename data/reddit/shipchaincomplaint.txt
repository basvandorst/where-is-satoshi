Hey.  People pay $100 for Trezor or Ledger, when they could spend $0.50 on a USB drive, or $0.00 for a piece of paper with a private key on it.

You signed up for a secure Bitcoin that nobody can afford to use?  That’s like saying you purchased a car that nobody can drive, because it’s got an outstanding lock on it. So at least it’ll never get stolen. 
My statistics above were wrong. 80% of the worlds population lives on less than $10 per day.
Security isn’t sacrificed by scaling blocks carefully and measured, while working on Layer 2 systems.  This keeps Bitcoin nearly free to onboard and use, for everyone.  
Isn’t that the ultimate goal?  A secure Bitcoin that everyone can afford to use?  


And yet I have more common sense, and understanding about Bitcoin than you do.

‘Member when people said without larger blocks, fees would go from sub-penny to over a dollar?
I ‘member.  Because it happened last week.
Please keep in mind that 70% of the worlds population lives on dollars a day. And they can’t afford a bitcoin with dollar ++ fees. Or a second layer that cost $10 to onboard.  
Did you sign up for a Bitcoin that 70% of the worlds population can’t afford to use? 
I didn’t.
This is the problem. And it’s not ancient history.

Then only you and maybe 20% of the human population will be able to afford to use it.  
And guess what?  They’re not going to use it because banks are already cheaper. 
Since you also “support” the other 80% leaving to use something else,  guess what you’ve created?  
A car with an amazing lock that nobody is going to drive.  Congratulations on killing the project.
Bitcoin was made for everyone to actually be able to use. And its cheapness and quickness were supposed to incentivize onboarding more people and businesses.  This is a reality that you cannot disprove.  And it’s possible to do it without causing centralization. 
*I can’t believe you actually said that 80% of the human population should just go find another solution.* ����‍♂️. What a toxic, dangerous, destructive mentality to promote.  


I’m sorry what?  You support banning people because of your subjective opinion that their viewpoint doesn’t reflect common sense?

Bitcoin is peer to peer cash.   
You might want to even read... maybe .... the title of the white paper.  
If you’re feeling REALLY crazy, read the first paragraph. It’ll blow your mind. 
Store of value is NOT bitcoin’s primary purpose.

Listen, you need to create a differentiation between usecases here. 
Bitcoin is supposed to be peer to peer cash. That’s it’s primary objective. 
99% of Altcoins aren’t trying to be Cash for the world.  They are building a whole financial industry with thousands of niche usecases.  
So it does make sense that one coin will likely be the king of the “Cash“ usecase. There may be a couple. But it’s not going to be 2,000. 
So when somebody tells you there’s going to be one dominant crypto, they’re just an idiot failing to explain they mean bitcoin will be “Cash“ for the world. 
Worldwide currency.  The Reserve currency. All that. You’ll probably be able to pay with ETH, BCH, Dash, and bunch of others in the future as well.  But one will likely rule in the cash usecase.

How does bigger blocks ignore the scaling problem? 
That is false.  You scale on chain to a safe level. This is such common sense I can’t believe you guys don’t grasp it. 
Scale on chain 2, 4, 6, 8 MB. 
Monitor how things are going. Go slowly. 
In the meantime build on the second layer to offload unnecessary transactions, and allow those who don’t mind a custodial based bitcoin to use it. 
But you don’t cut off 70% of the freaking human population by not scaling on chain at all. 
The way you guys view this thing is so completely skewed it’s mind-boggling. 
Scale both layer 1 and Layer 2 so that security and decentralization are maintained and you don’t completely destroy adoption.
