I sure do hope he runs! In fact Draft Biden will be getting a bitcoin donation from me. If he doesn't get in I'll be supporting Bernie. Almost anyone is better than lying &amp;  flip flopping HillBilly!

Medic mobile seems cool. Thanks for donating! 
@_date: 2015-06-03 08:45:52
Something along the lines of "I don't get it but that's cool". 
@_date: 2015-06-03 09:04:36
It would seem so since bitcoin mining is pretty much dead without having a huge farm and super cheap electricity!

$15 for domain registration is a bit steep. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 23:32:53
That's a start. Thanks! Now I need to fine a good web hosting company. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 08:32:10
Yes. I even had multiple mining rigs in my garage. Two years later I am about to propose... Once I can get a ring. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:15:04
Who do you use for web hosting? 
@_date: 2015-05-02 06:04:42
That's effin crazy!

Sweet! I am in Sacramento and it's cool to see people are finally hearing about it. I've been doing my part to spread the word to my friends for years. If anyone mines and needs a local data center I know one in Rancho Cordova that will host miners.

Good idea! I feel like there could be a lot of regulations and red tape to cut through. Although using it to trade gold is a great idea. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:54:51
Such high fees!

Stateless Sweets. Similar story.

Bet on Bernie. Donate and campaign for Bernie. Profit.

Same here, if I ever shave I may buy some though.

I have three contracts with bitcoin cloud services, I just logged in to check my account and I ordered my first 50gh with them Dec 6th and I am officially profitable. It cost 0.075
Last Payout Amount
Total Mined
It's not a lot but it's something and everything from now on is profit. 
Most cloud services are scams, but I've never had an issue with this one.

Very cool! I hear it's beautiful up there. My significant other lived there for a while and really liked it. I would try that app to calculate profitability, there are also websites that compare mining hardware. I think Spondoolies and Antminer are two of the best. Keep in mind they also generate a lot of noise and heat. May be good in the Winter up north but they suck in a hot California Summer! 
I also need to correct something. I just logged in to check my account with the company I linked in another comment, and I ordered my first 50gh with them Dec 6th and I am officially profitable. It cost 0.075
Last Payout Amount

It's not a lot but it's something and everything from now on is profit. 
Woo hoo!

You can use gyft or many other various methods to purchase on Amazon with bitcoin. I wouldn't spend now with the price so low. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 05:28:18
Mining wasn't well understood until recently and until recently I was able to make a pretty good profit. The website I mentioned doesn't charge maintenance fees, the initial cost is all inclusive (which is why it can appear more expensive than other services, some of which have gone under). They pay daily to your own personal wallet, not some account on on their website. You are however right to question these services. I've seen quite a few go under and steal people's btc, I mainly wanted to see my actual wallet filling up regularly since I sold my Spondoolies miner after excessive electric bills.

Hello. I had been mining for years, back when cpu/gpu mining was viable, and now doesn't seem like a good time to do is unless you have access to very cheap electricity. It's a shock when you make a few hundred dollars and then get an electric bill for almost as much (or more). USB miners are pretty much worthless. There's are websites which can help you calculate profitability as well as an app called bitcoin calculator. 
Most people say cloud mining is a scam. I have used  for around 6 months an never had a problem, but I wouldn't put more into it than you're willing to lose. I would buy coins and hold now since the price will go up at some point in the future.

I love bitcoin! 
@_date: 2015-04-18 04:56:14
Hey I like your website. Does anyone GPU mine anymore or is it mostly gamers shopping on your website? I'll send my friends who ordered GTA5 your way when they need an upgrade! 
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:39:38
Not necessarily. There have to be some legit ones out there. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 06:27:32
Why does it say hacked version when you go to levels? 
@_date: 2015-04-20 00:43:02
How do you know that?

Doesn't coinbase do this?
