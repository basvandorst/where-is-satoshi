@_date: 2015-12-09 00:34:27
It isn't one person. The article clearly states that Klieman made it and then a group assisted.

I'm very confused with this thread. All I said was that the war on drugs is a failure, because the stated goals of "eradication/disruption/thwarting" have not worked. Since the goal of the State was X, but they achieved Y, they did not succeed... Maybe they wanted different aims, but their stated goal of X, was never accomplished and as you stated, the exact opposite has occurred... Shit.
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:59:55
I don't get it. I thought the whole thing is stating that Klieman created it, with a group of people...

It was a group, with Klieman having the head involvement one way or another. I don't know how much Wright had to do with it other than assisting in some fashion.

@_date: 2015-12-09 00:39:04
Wait... Klieman is the one who created BTC. He lived in Florida. This Wright is from Australia, so the text/writing/etc is moot. It doesn't really state what Klieman did with Bitcoin, it just says he was friends with the creator of it, and a group of people, who made it.

No, the point of the war on drugs was to: eliminate, curb or deter the use and/or sale of said "drugs". But it hasn't gone that way at all. So, regardless of good or evil, it failed.

I have not been following this story closely, but after reading about it, this makes the most sense to me. As noted below, he only transferred these 442K BTC in 2011... I assume this was after the first incident correct?
Basically, he was running a fractional-reserve system, gave out fake receipts stating "This receipt is a bitcoin!"
That is really all it is huh?
@_date: 2014-06-27 15:30:20
So, just out of curiosity, where does the Blockchain come into play here? I know individuals below are discussing that the "feds are keeping him quite on Blockchain activity", but isn't the point of the Blockchain to be able to see these kinds of activities as they/after they happen?
Or, is it simply that these keys were stored off of the Blockchain, private keys stolen and never moved, hence no traceability?

Appreciate it. Regardless, .29 cents to watch that clip is a steep price, considering I didn't even watch the youtube, ad-free segment.
Now! I did watch {  } in full and would happily pay .29 cents, but that is because I was interested in it.
The issue I am getting at is, say I'm on and want to watch 20 videos... out of all of those, I will watch 2 in full...10%. The other 90% will be exited halfway/seconds in. Although I could have an automated system kickback any unused BTC to a change address, the issue still lies in that, I have to put up say, 5 dollars. Right now, I just pay for internet or just use free-wifi, with ad-blockers and pay $0 for unlimited use.
Mind you, I understand the market needs to evolve and my issues will most likely be taken care of, so I am glad we can have this dialog!

On top of that, I think a lot of people are just living their lives and hear the news, write it off or get offended by it and then they continue on.
However, the media is in an echo chamber, they spout all this horse shit propaganda and all it does is reinforce their little bubble. All the talk about disaffecting electors, came down to 2 people out of 538. That means all the hype, talk, agenda swinging, etc, for 350 million people, came down to 2 people actually making a change. The rest of the emails, threats, phone calls, etc, were bunk and did nothing.
These people exist on a different world. They don't live and understand things like we do. They are in a bubble and they think that if they hear their colleagues talking about how they are right, then the world itself is aligned with them. Unfortunately for them, the world is drastically different than their liberal bubble in NYC of 200 friends worth 20+ million dollars.

It is not "right" for Wyoming and Idaho to dictate policy and they do not dictate policy to population centers. They are essentially agricultural/rural places that have little say in anything.
There are two major issues here:
1- The President should have such little power, that we the people would not care who is elected overall, because their role is extremely limited.
2- Just because a Representative Republic is not perfect, does not mean we need to go to a Democracy. 50+1 vote of majority rule is even worse and more akin to a true tyranny, than a system like today where we have popular votes of the States, of and for the people in those centers.
Again, while not perfect, Hillary and all other presidential candidates in the primary and general elections ran on this elector based system. They all know the rules, they all know the game, they spend tens of million (or billions) to win this game and she lost it. All she literally had to do was campaign and push in the states that Obama won and 270 was in her pocket. Instead, she floundered and thought it was her turn and lost.

@_date: 2016-12-20 23:52:56
The first part of my response was "It is not "right" for Wyoming and Idaho to dictate policy"... I just said it isn't right for Wyoming or Idaho to dictate policy... I don't believe it is just for any man to rule over any other man in the first place.
But strictly speaking, the electors in those states have a higher weighting to balance out the disproportionate # of people who live in other places. It balances it out so that states matter more than just the # of people residing in certain places.
For instance, MI, WI, MN, FL, OH, PA, NH, NV, NH and CO all were in play this year. Those are swing states which can and do change all the time. Trump changed the whole game and broke the blue belt in the rust belt. A number of elections ago, a Republican would have no reason to go to WI or MI... but Trump and other people (Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul, etc) could potentially make other states in play, as opposed to another system where there is no reason to ever worry about those states.

What’s this about?
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:00:07
Ok, so take out the flyover states which are so non valuable and see how the rest of the country does. They contribute to the economic means in a massive way and culturally speaking, that is America, not some melting pot of Hipster lifestyle of Brooklyn and San Fran. Those places are the issue, not the solution.
People know the power resides in Cali, FL and NY. What those states do set the path of America forward. But those are cultural shifts that are voluntary, not coerced through State fiat.
Yes, one person means one vote. But you can bet that if tax payer monies in Idaho didn't want to support XYZ agenda and it was a popular vote, then yes, the candidate who wins CA and NY, effectively can rob the people in Idaho who are ideologically opposed to such agendas.
It is why we have a Constitution, with limited powers to the Federal government and the rest, Amendment 10, left up to the States to decide. The Federal Govt. should be doing very little and the more decentralized/restricted government is, the better.

@_date: 2015-03-09 04:52:37
Correct me if I am wrong, but if you create an offline wallet with Electrum and then never use the "watching-wallet" feature, then you are safe... The servers have no idea you created a wallet(because it is offline) and the only time it would ping their servers, is because of a watching wallet request.

Right, I understand that, but I was just looking to be sure if my technique was safe. My technique is to simply have the electrum offline wallet, with balance and monitor those keys through some medium other than the electrum servers(ie: blockchain.info)
Assuming blockchain is safe to monitor keys with, my spending will be done via hotwallet, similar to a normal wallet vs. bank account. Rarely need bank use, just keep my wallet/cash hot.

Can anyone explain why I should switch to 2.0 at this point? Why risk new software that could have holes/vulnerabilities etc, when my current Electrum is fine and does my cold storage without a hitch?
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:39:00
? Sorry don't understand. 
I've been around btc a long time. I dropped out with all the BS about 2 years ago. I put my trust in core, the ones who have gotten us to here today. As far as old school people like Ver and them, I see them as nothing more than snake oil pushers for their agenda. 
Is core in support of this segwit/bip measure?
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:50:00
Right so BIP148 is what we want, not some centralized/privately owned horse shit. 
What is Ver pushing?
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:10:24
Appreciate it. Hope for the best!

Question: If Electrum is installed on an offline computer and you never use a "watch-only" wallet for the online version, is this an issue? The only way for the servers to know your addresses is to bring them online via "watch-only" correct?
@_date: 2015-03-02 05:58:35
Right, so in terms of safety/storage, it is a fine method, without worry of compromise by the servers. However, as you stated, in order to spend, one needs to link it to 'watch-only'. But if I just want to watch my one address, I can do that via blockchain.info and not worry about compromise right?

Who would that be...
@_date: 2015-10-01 14:33:55
Ok, figured that may = the issue given Heroku exploding the past # of days.

Yes it can, you are arguing for it right now. Ownership is an implied/legal term to have proper claim over an asset/entity. Example: Human beings were owned, legally, by some slave owner. They were not controlled, because a slave could escape or run away. 
Control is the outright, physical, objective and provable exertion of the individual upon an entity/object/themselves, etc. Example: I control my BTC, because only I have the private key. The only way for them to be retrieved is by my admission/permission.

DO IT!!!

Technically, there is no ownership in bitcoin, since bitcoin is simply a digital ledger. Individuals can have control over a certain key that allows access to that given ledger cell, but I don't know or think that anyone actually owns bitcoin(s). 
I think Kinsella has a pretty strong argument on this, which is below:

[YES! No, no, no, no, no, no, YES!](
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:11:48
So, basically then, in terms of sheer privacy, there is no safe way to ever watch an address, given that everything online could be and should be considered compromised...

Good friends with Adam and Stef ;)

Whose the actor?
@_date: 2015-03-09 23:14:43
What is the reason to be nervous of checking 1 or 2 addresses in the first place? What value does using TOR have in regards to simply checking an address? What if I check numerous addresses daily anyway, like electronic frontier foundation or Freedomain Radio or Mises Institute?

Why DASH?

I mean, by and large, most of these issues are already enforced by private law today, without violence.
For instance, when you purchase a product on Amazon with a Credit Card and then don't pay your bill, the CC company will have creditors call and harass you. If you don't pay up, they simply further tarnish your credit, effectively ostracizing you from renting, purchasing cars, large items and much higher interest rates.
Regarding an individual who steals/commits violence, these are issues that are hard to work with in totality, since they are things that occur and police can only intervene after the damage is done. The root of the problem is children raised in an environment that teaches might makes right vs. peaceful parenting and proper raising.

Dude is a loser.

Same boat as you. A little guidance please!!!

Let the markets work!!!
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:57:26
Contracts and arbitration? For instance, you purchase something on Amazon now, they have a contract for XYZ on that purchase. The item arrives broken, you contact Amazon and they fix the issue for you, given you are within terms.
