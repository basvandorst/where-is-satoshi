@_date: 2014-11-07 00:35:06
To be fair in the complaint itself it says that Bitcoin has legitimate uses. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:28:27
I agree they should reimburse everything that was lost, or suffer the likely PR disaster if they don't.  
Are blockchain.info wallets insured to any extent a la coinbase/circle/etc?  If not, people need to seriously make the switch.  I know people hate on a lot of webwallets (if it's not you controlling the key, you don't control the money, yadayada), but all else being equal at least with Coinbase and Circle and those types that are insured you have some recourse if THEY screw up.
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:58:27
I agree that the community can absolutely overreact at times.  However, I also agree that every single action they make is and SHOULD be scrutinized.  That's how we get accountability and more importantly, that's how we improve bitcoin's infrastructure as a whole.

I have repeatedly popped up in threads trying to get people to look into his post history and how he lost tons of money investing in doge, lost tons of money investing in other ventures AND now is coming here talking about how BTC will save the world.  Edit:  Even if this post is self-deprecating, we need to stop getting his posts to the front.
This guy continued to pump doge selflishy since he was a bag holder as it went down, down, down.
People on keep upvoting this dude just because he is saying what they want to hear, when this guy is a toxic addition to this community IMO.  If we keep giving voice to people like this we are damaging bitcoin's reputation.

I mean.. I'm conflicted here.  On one hand people who drive drunk are pieces of shit, on the other it's quite a loss if it's a one time bad judgement.
Full disclosure here, my father drove drunk 10 years ago or so, got T-Boned (it was his fault, coming into an intersection), and although the other people were okay thank god, he suffered a traumatic brain injury that put him into ICU for a month.  He had to learn to walk again, etc.  
To this day I still hold that against him to an extent (he will never be the same, so my father pre and post crash is just simply different), but I still thank god, as sad as it is, that it was him that it happened to and that he didn't cause that injury to someone else.  
Don't get me wrong, I love my father to death, and it was a mistake, but it's just too reckless to be completely forgiveable.  He could have done that to someone else's parent, or child.
He didn't lose his car, though, so it must be a case by case basis.  Most people I know who have DUIs haven't lost their vehicle *unless* they have had multiple.
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:08:09
Despite what others may say, if you are using it as a small investment and not storing hundreds of thousands, I would utilize Coinbase.  I've used them without any issue since they came out.  The biggest thing I would look for in this situation is whether or not they are insured, and more importantly, for how much if THEY lose your coins.

I'm not one to witch hunt myself, but if it is an error on the companies part, the company needs to reimburse the individuals who lost the money, period.  
I don't see a need to slam them or drag them down any more *IF* they reimburse the money, but if they don't, they deserve (as would any company) the response.  Imagine if Bank of America lost some of your money from a banking or technical error.  People's response would not be "Oh they are humans who make mistakes."

At least Bitfloor, from my experience with them, went down with some kind of tact and refunded all the money.  If I remember correctly when it went down he sent out a message saying to withdraw your funds, and I was able to no issue.

No, they do not have an auto-buy function at the moment - or I mean, they do not have the option to make recurring purchases.

I can tell you as someone who has frequented that sub for over a year (different name) that that rule is great, in theory.  While it isn't the cesspool that is at times, people will still downvote smash you because you different from their opinions (or just attack you in general).
"Wut is this MS Paint graph??!?"
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:02:35
You have a good point and shouldn't be downvoted - it's possible but remember that it normally *shouldn't* happen because the person calling could easily have stolen that credit card info.  That's bad business practice in my opinion, and probably could get them in legal trouble (IANAL).
Since those safeguards aren't in place with Bitcoin (good and bad), it's probably easier at the moment to call in and pay via bitcoin than via credit card.

"Hi guys, I saw that post where the guy took out 30k in credit and is rich, so obviously, with Bitcoin being a short-term can't miss, I did the same.  Please heed my tale."
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:57:17
You're right, but in a case like this, where not much money was lost in the grand scheme of things (100k), I would prefer to have an insured company as my wallet host as opposed to an uninsured.  For some, 1 or 2k might be all the BTC to their name, as an investment.  While I understand it's unlikely an insurance company would/could pay out a catastrophic failure such as in Mt. Gox's situation, on the other hand a 100k payout isn't too big.
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:31:11
It's always been like that, though - at least since the prices were around 90 dollars.  Maybe it was a better community when it was much smaller than even then, but you know how is - when prices are going up, it's to the moon, everyone is gonna be rich, etc.  When prices drop, the top post is always the suicide hotline.  
I like coming here for the news and occasional discussion but obviously as a whole this sub is a bit too emotional and lacking good judgement.
@_date: 2014-12-03 02:11:49
Please check my post history and then you will see how dumb your comment is.
@_date: 2014-10-26 03:32:51
No, the issue is that 10k is where the reportable amount comes in.  So when you deposit 10k, it's my understanding that the bank has to report that amount.  Kind of like if you cross the border into/out of America you need to declare anything more than 10k.  Right or wrong that's the way it is.
So anyway what happens is people who are laundering money or who have income from unsavory things, they don't want to raise any flags at the bank, so they don't want to deposit more than 10k.
So what they do is deposit (exaggerating) $9,999 every time, sometimes consecutively.  If I recall it's called structuring.  So this raises flags as well because then the bank/IRS/government whoever thinks they are intentionally trying to evade the reporting requirement.
I didn't read the article but from your comments that's what I'm guessing happened.
Edit:  So lazy I didn't even read a few comments down.  Well the explanation I'll leave anyway haha.

So we are going to side with an anonymous person on the internet who already hid relevant facts, instead of Coinbase which many, many people have thus far had no issues with, including myself, after more than a year or two?  
So it's more likely that Coinbase is the devil because they are REQUIRED to follow AML laws and they drudged up a whole fake reason to close this guys account (with zero coins in it mind you) instead of the chance that an Iranian may have logged in from an Iranian IP?  Please.

Can you explain why it even matters if they don't have the money they claim to, if the wallets are now multi-sig and solely under your control?  If they got hacked again or something happened, how could someone access your BTC if it's multisig?

This is actually true to an extent.  In the run up to 275 GOX crapped the bed again by getting DDOSd to death and then having all of their trades executed with horrific lag.  Was hilarious and sad to watch at the same time as someone personally involve for quite some time with BTC.

According to Bitgo's site, its 2/3 and they only hold one key... so are you sure that the user will not be in control of their own funds?

Don't listen to anyone else about this stuff man, it sounds like sour grapes.  Sure you shouldn't be putting 100% of everything you have into an investment (any investment) but it's your money now to do with what you want.  Sounds like a lot of people are just upset that they don't have the ability to do the same thing, so they judge your decision to invest in cryptos.  Most of the people here would love to be in your shoes, but aren't, so instead they'll judge and be rude.  I'm not saying I think it's a good decision or a bad decision but it's *YOUR* decision.  I hope it works out for the best.

I don't disagree, but at the same time none of us know what is "smart."  That guy who took out like 40k in *credit card debt* to buy a ton of bitcoins was called an idiot and all sorts of things.  I agreed, too.  Unfortunately in the end he was smart and we were stupid.  Just because it's super risky doesn't mean it's dumb - as long as it pays off.  It's only dumb if you lose.

Hmm good question...  I guess it comes down to who is the most trusted, most convenient, etc.   I have no issue with a company controlling one key as long as they have zero control over my funds in reality.   I really want a balance of best security and best convenience which I know is tough. 
I think one key with the company may be best so I don't have to do a bunch of legwork each time..  But like I said, kind of new to the idea of multi.   Thanks for responding.

This is a bit unfair even though I hate paypal as much as the next guy.  
For anyone not following, the LAST winner (January) submitted a FALSE name to Paypal, because he didn't want to give out his real name.  Obviously Paypal can't play that game because of government regulations, so they froze his account and returned all the money.  I would imagine the actual amount of money donated via paypal was FAR more than any other method, but Paypal returned the money and froze a portion (870) of it.
Whether or not you like Paypal, we all know they have to follow money transmitter and KYC laws.  The reason the money was frozen was because the dude lied to them and gave them a fake name.
That being said I always donate in BTC.
