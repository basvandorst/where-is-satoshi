Bitclub response and solition seems fairly reasonable and provides hope that other miners will follow suit in future.

Makes sense. Thanks for your input. This is just one of many scenarios that raises many unanswered questions to come.

That’s not the point/concern.  If Coinbase reports the transfer as a “sell”, the IRS will assume that a taxable event occurred. Obviously if the IRS requested documentation of a transfer, one can clarify that the transaction was a transfer and not a sell. In order to do that you may have to provide the IRS access to your hard wallet.

Dollar cost averaging.....great strategy!

The bigger question here is the transfering of your bitcoin from coinbase to a hard wallet i.e. ledger, as an example. Let’s say you purchase bitcoin for $5000, it appreciates to $10,000 and you transfer 10K bitcoin to your hard wallet. How does Coinbase report that to the IRS? If it is reported as a “sell”, the IRS will send you a notice.  When you dispute the notice, the IRS will then ask for documentation of your not selling the 10K bitcoin which can only mean having to provide the IRS access to your private wallet. I can see this opening a Pandora’s box. Scary!!!

The elephant in the room here is the IRS. Seems you experienced some healthy gains. My advice is that you consider your tax liability and plan accordingly. The IRS is mounting a strong and ambitious initiative to secure information relative to crypto currently gains. Congrats on your BTC investment results....but the taxman cometh.

You're spot on placidpaper. I too chuckle when I see the use of stock market terms relating to cryptos. That's a clear indication to me that there's still a fundamental misunderstanding of cryro. Just wish more of these "crypto-tourists" get better educated to the dynamics of this new asset class.......and HODL.

Yep! If you really observe these "technical analysts", their observations are always fuzzy statements back by conjecture. I would argue that any attempts to analyze crypto with any credibility is much too premature because of the volatility and nature of the underlying assets.

Have used Coinbase for past 3 years with no regrets. They have their growing pains but still very user-friendly. I keep a healthy amount of cash in reserve. The cash reserves are insured by FDIC. Also, Coinbase is based in the USA and puts a premium on regulatory compliance.

I firmly believe the banks consider BTC a serious threat....they would be fools not to. The major US banks are starting to invest large amounts of money exploring Bitcoin and blockchain technology. It stands to reason that some banks/countries will resist or at least slow the progress of anything that softens their control of something so critical and basic as financial services. The potential impact of bitcoin is just too extraordinary to ignore.

Dream on.....this is mearly the natural evelution of cryto-currency. Up til this point it was pure speculation. BTC is starting to coalesce into the fintech ethos. A very small but significant start

We tend to forget that Bitcoin and crytocurrency are very unique investments. Most of what I have read (past 2 years) consistently refers to it from a traditional wall street/brokerage perspective. The very nature of bitcoin and unique process of its technological complexities dictates a rethinking as to how it should be viewed void of any traditional currency, investment biases. This is going to be a long, long journey with extreme ups and downs. But it will survive.

Wow!!! Thanks for your efforts and sharing

Rememeber the investor's "sleep test".....if you know your investment will result in a lack of sleep......don't invest in it! Bitcoin is highly volatile, complicated, and, in my opinion, a longterm strategic investment. It is not for amateurs and/or the faint of heart.
