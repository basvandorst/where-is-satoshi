I onboarded an Australian woman who knows nothing about tech or investing but even she seemed to think bitcoin was invented by an Australian. So the very first conversation we had about it had to cover BSV and Craig Fucking Wright.

The only reason your mind needs the price to recover quickly is because your time frame is not long enough. Why are you monitoring the price all day, for starters? Any investment (not just btc) needs a long time to appreciate. Ignore the price and learn about the tech for a bit. If you cannot do that, you should probably invest in something more traditional first. This is not the game for you if you are very loss averse.

Thank goodness for LocalBitcoins. Can't get it on centralized exchanges either because none accept Chinese bank transfers / credit cards
@_date: 2019-01-22 12:40:42
None that I've found. Uphold does, kinda, but the ICBC debit card is limited by the bank to like 30USD online transaction per day which is useless. Only use LocalBitcoins to buy from random Chinese People using Alipay
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:50:34

We keep it mostly to ourselves. I buy the BTC on localbitcoins from Chinese people, they all say things like "Please don't mention the words BTC, Bitcoin etc in the Alipay transaction." I assume that's because they don't want the CCP to know about it
@_date: 2019-01-22 15:47:46


Actually no I'm not because crypto  isn't illegal here at all. The only thing is that banks aren't allowed to touch it. Actually a mate of mine who works for a major US exchange that you definitely all use is working with the government in order to work out some regulatory issues there.
I can make a transfer on Alipay or Wechat (The two most important Chinese mega-apps) to an individual Chinese person who sends me bitcoin, and the only thing that they can know is that the transaction happened. I could have been paying for BTC, or second-hand furniture, or sex, and the government has no way of knowing what it was for. Especially since the fiat and crypto transactions are initiated on different devices. 
So it is in fact the perfect hoodwinking of the crazy restrictions on financial movement over here. Pity now the price wouldn't go up a bit so I wouldn't be quite so rekt :D

Of course. you can filter the search and pair up with someone who will pay you into your Western Bank account. But actually the only thing that's awkward in China is fiat on/off ramping. Once you have the btc you can trade on whatever exchange you want. don't even need a vpn for that
