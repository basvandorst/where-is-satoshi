Yeah, you tipped me a small amount a while back. I think it was like $5 or something, but it was really cool to see it in action.
Just try not to corner the market in Bitcoin (or, for that matter, orange juice futures) :). My largest reservation with BTC is that there really is nothing preventing whoever owns that 10% wallet, or anyone with 1% of the market, really, from just cashing out (which I'm convinced they will someday need to for tax purposes). While many on these boards hate central banks, having emergency liquidity can be useful.

I guess to an enterprising criminal, what better time to try and hack an exchange than on the day when the exchange is upgrading their hardware?
If they blow bitcoin to smithereens, they has definitely learned a lot about site security (and probably gained a lot of underground cred) and hacking and cyber warfare. If not, he's rich beyond his wildest dreams. Plus, governments don't really see BTC as a currency, so there's no legal risk either. There is no downside here.

Well enforcement against drugs would work about as well as it always has.
But for silk road, one of the advantages is that you can easily cash in/cash out into dollar. If the gov't were to ban exchanges, you would have to pay cash to someone to buy BTC, transfer it, then pay cash out. Price discovery is shot so you'd have to take on that risk too.

Worst case (and i may sound like a conspiracy theorist here, but it's happened before, in finance, so who knows):
MtGox failed to properly segregate client dollar accounts. Therefore, it was difficult to tell which money belonged to which of their clients. Knowing that Bitcoin was all the rage, they spent some of those client funds. On what, who knows? Perhaps buying BTC for their own account, or perhaps they blew it on strippers and coke.
But here's the twist. MtGox takes their fees in BTC. As long as BTC went up perpetually, they were taking more than their "fair share" of each transaction because they got the BTC PLUS the time value of the appreciation in value of those coins. 
But suddenly UH OH! The market was slammed down. And perhaps some of their employees spent too much money (out of unsegregated accounts, so they may have spent some CLIENT money). So no, not only did the market thin out in a hurry, but perhaps some of their clients requested withdrawals of money (which is now gone because they didn't properly segregate the accounts). Well, now they have a few choices to pay. They could liquidate their bitcoins, but unfortunately, the market depth wasn't enough to get them the cash without taking a big loss. So, they can stop people from taking money out. At best, it gives them time to come up with the money from the proceeds from trading. At worst? They force their clients to buy BTC to transfer to other exchanges, which not only drives up the value of their own holdings, but also nets them a big pile of trading fees.
Sound like a conspiracy? Maybe. Ask Jon Corzine.

I can see this being an obstacle for large corporates. BTC is just too easy to steal for insiders in large quantities. Imagine if a company needs to pay a vendor $5 million, and it holds BTC until then, hoping the appreciation will work in their favor. But suddenly, because it's a larger institution, and the CEO isn't overseeing day-to-day transactions, a motivated IT guy hijacks the accountant's password, sends himself the lot. There's so much risk here, and no real way to prove it.
I think the only way this will work in the long term is if the company converts it dollar on-the-fly, and does exactly what you just said. I know this goes against BTC being a currency, but a dollar portal will make it very usable and easy to propagate. Hopefully, the improvement of transactional technology will make selling the coins much cheaper and easier. Bitpay, while a great idea, costs 1%, and I have a feeling a large part of this is because exchanges have large transactional fees and make it very hard to move large amounts of money quickly (i.e. if Bitpay has to pay $100,000 in cash, they're gonna have a bad time). With the ease of transactions, and lack of crushing regulation, this 1% could go much lower.
I know people really hate paypal and credit cards, but understand that the fees are there for a reason. To protect against, fraud, chargebacks, to pay the call center support, the analysts, customer rewards, regulatory risk, default risk, etc... With bitpay, there should be none of these (although an honest company should make good faith to handle a chargeback to build their reputation, especially with BTC, which is untested and has a die-hard, and very unified group of supporters)

Because not everyone is well-read on cyber security. Just a few days ago there was someone on these boards who got hit. 
The idea that BTC prevents fraud is a very dangerous one, in my opinion. For 99.99% of people, fraud is going to become an even bigger problem since there is no recourse.

I am hoping this becomes the case, as it would offer mom and pop a secure way to store them (although I can't for the life of me figure out how insurance claims would work in the event of an attack, other than being cash settled, since there's no guarantee of liquidity and/or lender of last resort in the BTC space).
For the exact reason mentioned above, I think it'll hopefully just force banks to adopt better payment services. Yeah, so there are customer-friendly features that can't really be avoided, but the idea of transferring money quickly between a network a banks is cool, even if it isn't distributed. Chase Quikpay is already doing this, and in my opinion, could evolve to offer many advantages over BTC.
Just my two cents.

You're thinking of bonds ex-risk.
Let's for a minute assume that the USD is our point of zero-risk. This is not unreasonable since defaults in the US are dollar-denominated defaults.
If you take the US 10-Y as your benchmark "risk-free" bond vs cash (i.e. holding the USD is very roughly as risky as holding the 10-Y Treasuty), which currently trades under 2%, you're still losing to inflation.
Of course you could invest in other bonds, but then you run the risk of default. If you believe in perfect markets, then there exist no inherently deflationary risk-adjusted bonds. If you had the money to do so, I would advise you buy $10M notional in bonds, then buy $10M notional in CDS against those bonds. Even if you don't want to further hedge the exposure of your CDS counterparty, you're not going to make risk-adjusted returns.
Also, 99% of the population cannot just go out and buy bonds.
Also, unlike Treasuries, which have a long-time horizon, feeding yourself has the time horizon of about 24 hours in normal circumstances.

@_date: 2013-04-12 04:40:13
Just FYI, when you transfer coins into BitFloor/MtGox, you are transferring it to one of the addresses they temporarily set up for you for that transaction.
They do this so they know who is sending/receiving funds. They will associate address 123456 with ChiliWilikers, and address 234567 to me. That way, if I deposit $5, and you deposit $10, they know that you get 10 and I get 5.
I believe Bitpay uses a similar system to track transactions. How does Bitpay know that Merchant A just received $100, and Merchant B just received $50? Because Merchant As address got $100 and Merchant Bs got $50. Presumably they also dynamically change the addresses as well to prevent hacking attacks.

Pardon my ignorance, but won't this make it more expensive to use the protocol?
Let's assume an example right now:
Visa costs the vendor between 3-4%. Plus they return 1% rewards. So let's just say the net cost that goes to Visa is 2-3%, depending on the transaction size (of course, Amazon probably gets much better rates, but I would assume bitpay can go below .99% for large vendors too).
For bitpay, if we assume I don't have any coins, I pay MtGox .6%, then bitpay takes 1%. So net cost roughly 1.6%. So we have roughly a 1.5% advantage to using bitcoin. Won't the use of a chargeback protocol just squeeze this more?
@_date: 2013-04-25 13:42:34
Two things:
1) If you sold and then bought in again, which many people have tried to do with varying degrees of success, I am willing to bet that you didn't record that realization transaction.
2) Since bitcoin is, for all intents and purposes, dollar denominated, when you earn them and then spend them, there is an argument that you have just realized gains. After all, your 1 BTC you made last year bought you a round of drinks at a bar today. Clearly, there was appreciation, and that is definitely taxed (although the government is unlikely to care).
3) Chartalism is a modern economic theory which basically states that the ability to buy goods and services from the government is what gives fiat money its value. You can try and fudge this through payment processors, but the bottom line is that if you want to own anything, the government is going to tax you. Unless you are already supremely wealthy and don't need to dip into your stash (which would be depressing, because it would make more and more people see BTC as a pyramid scheme, as well as reinforce its non-productivity), taxes must be paid in the local currency.

Although it has been an unpopular opinion on this board, I have been saying for a while:
"Pay your damn taxes"
Yeah, if you make a few thousand bucks, the government is unlikely to care, in the same way that the government doesn't really care if waitresses don't report cash tips. 
On the other hand, tax evasion has no statute of limitations in the US and is hugely illegal in almost any jurisdiction. You know how people blast Mitt Romney for using offshore tax havens? Well this isn't a tax haven or loophole, it's flat out evasion (again, for 99% of users, the government is unlikely to care, nevertheless). Plus, it could easily be argued that each transaction with BTC is a realization event that generates capital gains/losses. If the community as a whole is not careful with this, the bitcoin experiment could go south in a hurry.
The thing that worries me most is too many gung-ho users repeating the Ghandi quote about fighting then winning, when in reality it will probably look like this:

Highly doubt it's a problem with their bank. With the amount of money financial institutions send around the world on a daily basis, I have a VERY hard time believing that they simply "can't handle the volume".
If you had said "to comply with AML practices", or "we're under investigation for cashing out to serious bad guys around the world", I may have believed it. But when you expect me to believe that institutions that send billions around the world on behalf of their clients every day can't handle the volume? I dunno.

The only way to cash out is to buy coins is to buy them and transfer them to another site.
Also, as merchants such as Coinbase/Bitpay/whoever start moving off of MtGox, selling starts to disappear. So you have a perfect storm of everyone taking their coins somewhere else, plus everybody on Gox desperate to get their money out any way they can. Basically, it's a liquidity squeeze.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:32:39
Agreed. Especially because mtgox is not a US entity or regulated by the CFTC/ISDA, which makes it very annoying for large merchants to transact in it. Add in the counterparty risk from PayPayl paying the Yakuza to bomb their home office.
Plus, what if you batch your BTC trades throughout the day, and then the guy responsible for turning it into dollar decides to send himself the day's payout (or even skim some off the top, due to price increases)? Huge liability, and without possibility of legal recourse.
The big gain in the stability of coins will be merchants doing dollar-denominated transactions. Right now, there are only buyers, very few sellers. As soon as merchants start using a payment processor that actively sells the coins for dollar, there will be a countervailing sell force in the market to stabilize it.

In the same way that you need banks with large infrastructure investments to bank corporates, you're going to need banks with large infrastructure investments to bank Bitcoins.

Yet another reporter using notional numbers in order to sell a story.
On the one hand, yes, trillions of dollars of instruments are priced using a spread from LIBOR.
On the other hand, the traders were fixing LIBOR up or down one or two basis points. If you had a variable mortgage that used a spread from LIBOR, your rate would have been off by .01% (and this could work to your advantage). Drunkenly ordering a round of drinks for your buddies probably costs you more.
To equate that to outright fraud is dishonest.

I have to interject. The thing is, it may not be Royal Bank's fault that they're freezing accounts.
Many banks have automatic circuit breakers in place to make sure that people don't get their identities stolen. For example, making suspicious transactions in places you never have before. 
So let's assume you're a normal everyday American guy. All of your transactions are roughly centered around your local area stores, and maybe some internet transactions on Amazon.
Suddenly, the selfsame average dude is trying to wire $2000 to an offshore bank account. This bank account happens to be based in a country he's never spend money in before, and happens to trade bitcoins. Once the money's in there, it can be gone within 30 seconds with no hope of getting it back (i.e. thief buys BTC and transfers them out immediately).

That's actually the exact opposite of what I was worried about.
Since Mt Gox/BTC-e are not audited, maybe they are selling "paper-BTC" (the BTC equivalent of GLD). They know that not everyone is going to withdraw all of their cash and BTC all at once, so they keep some of the cash and BTC in non-segregated accounts to use for themselves. If everybody were to suddenly pull all their money from MtGox, is there any guarantee that all the money is actually there?
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:07:21
The way you design your crypto coin will be different depending on whether you want it to be a transactional instrument or a currency/store of value.
As a transactional instrument, I could imagine some sort of moving "inflation", where new coins get generated based on how long coins are held. Or perhaps you could have the holder of the coins money be sent back to the nodes, so that the longer you "hold" it, you slowly bleed (like, .001% a day, for example) that money to the people who store the blockchain.
That way, you are forced to either cash it out for money or spend it relatively quickly, or lose value. 
If, on the other hand, you want to make it a currency, I have no idea. You're idea has a lot of merit, but then you need a centralized group that agrees on the rate of expansion. I guess theoretically you could peg it to a basket of resources, but I'm not sure how you would manipulate the supply without exposing the system to attack. 
What about a system that will issue a fixed amount of currency for like, 1000 years? Steady and predictable rate of inflation?

VWAP is the volume weighted average price for BTC. Basically, it multiplies the quantity of bitcoin transacted by the price per bitoin, and divides the final total by the quantity of bitcoin transacted. Basically, over the course of some time period, what was the average cost of BTC.
In terms of an algo playing jump rope with the line, the entire point is that a sufficiently motivated institution with large amounts of resources would short sell the shit out of the order stack, drop the price by a ton, then buy it all back slowly, buying the dip upwards then submit large orders to ramp the price up before selling the peak down again. The VWAP in this context doesn't mean very much except as a benchmark.

This may sound tautological, but deflation in one asset is good when there is bad inflation in another. For example, Gold as a store of value when shit gets fucked up (although gold is securitized now, but that's another discussion). Likewise, deflation for bitcoin is bad when the system is stable and fiat money holds value (whether it loses it through inflation or confiscation is irrelevant). But when fiat starts to lose value, the deflationary asset is the safe haven.
The exact same argument applies for inflation. Inflation is good when deflation is bad. Take Japan. The deflation caused everyone to just hoard Yen and not spend it. While they were still exporting, they were bringing in new money into their economy. If they stop being net exporters, they need to either inflate (and encourage spending), or have their economy crash because no one spends.
I know gold is not the perfect example here, but in 2008, when it looked like the Fed was going to have to print its way out of the hole, the value of gold (if you view gold as a currency) started to increase simply because you held it, not because it became productive. Likewise, in really good times, gold tends to underperform because holding gold is not productive, and people would rather spend on other things.
I for one would love to see a crypto currency with some expanding base. If only because it encourages people to move it around.

But banks and credit cards already have low transaction fees for customers (especially if you're a merchant who has Treasury services). For all the advantages of BTC, this isn't one of them. 
In fact, my credit card actually gives me money when I spend it. For 99% of all transaction, it is strictly superior to cash (or BTC, which has the added problem of being deflationary and making me regret my purchases when it goes up 5% a day)  (unless I'm tipping the waitress at my favorite bar).

The biggest concern is that a bank or non-segregated depository may or may not have enough physical gold to cover all of the outstanding shares in the event that people want physical delivery.
For example, COMEX, as I recall, only has about 1-2% of the amount of total gold traded every day in physical. The primary reason is because very few traders ever want actual gold, they just want to settle their gains in cash. 
Now, setting aside the fact that such a day would be the end of the world, if all traders suddenly wanted physical delivery, many people would be left with nothing, forcing the exchange to settle the claims in dollar/pound. Of course, it's the end of the world, so your pounds are not worth all that much any more (then again, neither would your 400 oz brick of gold, in that scenario).

Which would work fine until someone gets the following idea in their head:
"Gee, you guys are getting an awful lot of equipment for free, mind telling us how you did it?"
There are a vast array of tax laws than can make anyone not using a legal loophole very sad. The government right now doesn't care about someone making $1000 on the coins. However, it will care if an organization already on legal ground tried to use them to dodge tax laws. Merely spending a bitcoin can very easily be argued as a realization event for capital gains/losses (after all, the hosting fees they pay change w/ bitcoin value, right?). Willful avoidance of taxes is really not a good thing, despite the libertarian kumbaya on this board, and it can get you into a lot of trouble.
This isn't even touching what happens if the gov't decides that bitcoin is money laundering. Even using a pool or multiple addresses to obfuscate its origins could be considered an act of money laundering (it's just that Bitcoin is, for the time being, too small for the government to care).
The way that bitcoin gains acceptance is that it needs to have the willing cooperation of the government, and a transparent way to account for gains/losses. Deliberately trying to evade the tax code will turn out very badly for those involved.

In my opinion, if merchants became increasingly willing to transact in BTC (if you're large, it will most likely be through a dollar-denominated service such as bitpay), we would see the countervailing "sell" force in the markets.
Ignoring anti-tax libertarians, any large corporate will have to transact everything in dollar terms. Having bitcoin exchange rate exposure is just not in the playbook, unless you want to invite the IRS to shut down your business because your accountant didn't know how to do some conversion, or you invite a lawsuit because you paid some trader to handle it and he fucked up (in the meantime, you have put yours and your employees' livelihood at risk). 
The fact that taxes and income statements still have to be declared in USD will especially force larger corporates to use BTC as a payment processor and not as a buy-and-hold speculative instrument. I have been pitched the idea of bitpay with the company I work at to do exactly this, because we are not in the interest of asset speculation. We are strictly trying to use it as a transactional vehicle and save some money in the process.

Does bitcoin solve this problem? I guess there's nothing you could do for a very small business, but if you were transacting large amounts of product every day you'd still be liable to having the gov't step on you unless you really hid your presence well (a la drugs, but I have a feeling that drugs were doing just fine before bitcoin came around).
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:55:47


I think you've hit on a very important problem. Bitcoin is a perfect hunting ground for tax evasion (you did declare those incomes from cashing out last year, right???????) and the drug trade. And, for 99.99% of people, doesn't provide any upgrades to the credit card (good luck explaining cyber security to your friends, and you actually get rewards points for spending on credit).
You definitely have a point about charities. However, it is not the bitcoin protocol as much as the ease of transferring money that makes this attractive, which is a service that banks could roll out (plus, a great many number of charities also have some really shady practices).

So I haven't ever dealt with Comex, but my understanding is that you can resolve any contract in physical delivery, provided both you and the contract issuer agree on it before hand.
But on that note, isn't a single gold contract on Comex worth 100 oz? I'm not sure how you would get 1/10 oz of gold out of that. My guess is if you tried to request delivery they would just laugh in your face.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't a security need to be regulated by [somebody] to be considered under the IRS code? Also, when you spend the coins, presumably you have to realize gains (or losses), right? For a small coffee shop, maybe not, but for a large corporate with $50 million+ in sales, I'd say probably yes (plus, you'd want to write off those costs, right?). It would look a little strange to the IRS if an internet commerce company was booking millions in accounting gains. I'm not actively involved in the financial industry, so I'm not clear on this. I do, however, know that no bank can transact/hedge bitcoin for a corporate client (according to my buddy who works in Forex).


Exactly why I'm trying to pitch this idea to the company I work for using Bitpay. Not to toot my own horn, I'm just an employee, but the company has a pretty significant e-commerce footprint in my opinion (although I can't publicly reveal who the company is because I am not speaking on behalf of them), and it's private, so we have some leeway with regulations.

Aside from laws that make it so, there's nothing difficult about moving lots of money overseas very fast. During the LTCM crisis in 1998, 15 years ago, about $4 billion wire transfer was executed basically in under an hour. People need to be careful about how much stock they put the "rapidly moving money anonymously" part of bitcoin.

I would say "net", probably not all that much. Any company that does more than $10 million in annual sales has special credit cards, deals with credit card companies, and if you're really big, you can get even better contracts, and treasury services from your bank which lowers the cost of payment processing even more. And then Amazon probably does a lot of things with its own corporate credit card, so some of the margin they lose is made back up when they spend and get rewards on their card.
And then keep in mind credit cards give 1% rewards to the customer, and they also "pull-forward" spending. With BTC, if you don't already have them, it's a pain in the butt. But with a credit card, you can pull forward spending by just paying it off when the bill comes due.
Most large companies have deals with CC for lower rates and faster processing. It's really small vendors who really don't like credit cards.

On this topic, how exactly does a processor like Bitpay account for thin market liquidity? If someone buys something during a low-volume day or time, the resulting sell from Bitpay can easily tank the price. 
I have only really come up with two ideas:
1) Bitpay is making the commission from the merchant + bid/ask
2) Bitpay sets its prices basically based on the largest "wall" which has at least as many orders as the size of the transaction.
Either way, seems kinda shady.

As a business owner, do you just take the BTC and hold them? Or do you cash them out for dollar so your accountant doesn't kill himself and so you don't invite the IRS/black helicopters wondering how you are getting so much additional un-taxed business?

Won't have to be Japan. I would be willing to bet that a lot of traffic on Gox has to do with noobies getting into the system. If bitcoin was bigger, I can't foresee it being that hard to stop people from wiring money from the US into certain overseas accounts without some heavy paperwork.
In fact the government is already doing this with many tax dodgers.

So my best friend works at a bank and does currency hedging for large corporates. No corporate who does over, say $50 million in sales annually that's NOT trying to make money on BTC is going to have to do on-the-spot conversions (because BTC can't be transacted through a bank, and you need a paper trail). 
Any holding in BTC, given it's volatility, is a supremely bad idea for a corporate because of the tax issue, and because of the accounting issue. Like it or not, the US dollar is incredibly useful when paying US taxes. They would much rather just take a 1% loss on the transactional fee with a processor (or maybe pay a trader to do it on MtGox for less, although you'd have to somehow prevent him from sending all the coins to himself) just to have cash coming in that's easy to account for.
I think bitpay has a bright future in this area. It has an established niche (internet payment processing), and is making 1% on the commission, which is enough to take care of BTC volatility in the markets in small time windows, guarantee a rate at time of transaction, and earn themselves some money in the process.
As any company doing more than a few million in sales, this would be the only solution.

Just to be Devil's Advocate here. This is TERRIBLE for any market. There will never, ever be any incentive to spend it. People will never take risks with money if they have a risk-free rate of holding.
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:44:09
I'm guessing it's because the additional transaction fees would make me wonder why I didn't just spend dollar?

Not to be the douchebag here, but why can't you juse run to the local CVS, make a money order with a fee of like $1, then give it to your landlord?
And while we're on that subject, isn't the ATM fee like, at most $5? Like, when you're talking about a $1000 deposit, I almost feel like you can just let the $5 go. If you didn't already have BTC, that's what you'd have to pay to buy them from an exchange anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:25:20
For anyone you would not feel comfortable with, just shut down the account. While bitcoin may have made some people rich, if it compromises your savings and your identity, it's not worth it.

Marijuana is pretty untraceable.
All the gov't has to do to slaughter bitcoin would probably be to just seize Mt Gox and all of its assets. Tell people they can't get their money back until they pay taxes and prove they aren't money-laundering.
Yeah, you'll still be able to transact in coins and deal in coins for cash for anonymous transactions, but at that point wouldn't you just pay cash anyway?
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:19:07
It isn't. I was merely pointing out the fact that having a lot of cash sitting there is not necessarily good for the stability of the price.
If anything, the inflow/outflow ratio implies that the price will continue to be highly volatile.
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:53:11
No, my comment was pointed at the fact that just because they have only $1MM of outflows each day does not include people who sell their coins, then sit on the cash without withdrawing it.

First they ignore you.
Then they laugh at you.
Then they seize your assets.

Right now, bitcoin has too much volatility, too much regulatory risk, and too many experienced traders in it. Unless you can afford to absolutely punt $500, I would highly recommend using another instrument to learn.
But if you're really still interested, never use a market order (order to buy at the market price). You open yourself up for traders to run up the price, and then clobber you. Always use a "limit" order, which is an order that only will clear at the price you set. If you set a "buy 1 BTC" with a limit order of $100, you will not buy the BTC unless a whole BTC is available for $100 or less.

Paypal and Visa might be hard to knock down.
The security of bitcoin will ultimately be a huge barrier. No chargebacks, so fraud will screw the owner. No rewards points. If i can get 1% back on a purchase vs 0%, I'm going to take the 1%. No bank where you can earn interest once we get out of this global ZIRP environment. I like my Visa card because if anyone ever steals it, I'm not on the hook for the payment. You also get cool perks like price matching with a Visa card, extended warranty and return policy, and you can are extended a small "revolving" loan where you can borrow money if you need to.

No. Nasdaq as an index has never recovered the levels, and many companies (Microsoft, Cisco) haven't either. Of course you will find success stories like Amazon or Priceline, but for every company that made it, there were companies that failed.

Agreed. But as I said, as long as the Yen coming in, whatever the amount was coming in, as long as it was enough to fund the deficit, they were golden. Now their trade balance has gone fully negative and they don't just need QE, they need outright Central Bank monetization of assets. They aren't just printing money, they're printing money, then buying stocks and real estate. 
Japan is going to be an interesting bubble to watch too. Much longer life cycle than BTC, but it's going to have infinitely higher human cost.

I'm not sure any regulatory body would ever allow Google to run a payment service that doesn't allow chargebacks.
Think about the rhetoric about protecting consumers from the vulture credit card companies. The ones who charge you interest on money you owe them. Now imagine if Google was taking a fee, and then not allowing chargebacks, and offering no fraud protection, and allowing assets easily move across borders. 
Now imagine the average userbase of Google. It has the intelligence of the average person, which (and not to be a snob here), is not all that high. I certainly wouldn't call the average person "intelligent" (of course, that's a statistical statement).

I think the net impact would have to be pretty close to zero. Western Union probably has a lot of legal and accounting obligations to not do certain things (such as hold currencies for speculative purposes).
As such, any bitcoins deposited in Western Union for the purpose of transfer would be sold as soon as they got to their destination. They might provide more market depth, but every buyer would be basically exactly matched to the sale of the same amount of coins.

Plus with BitInstant, there's no way to verify that they aren't screwing on the price during high-volatility days. 
I'm pretty confident that I've been screwed at least $100 due to BitInstant "market-timing" my order with them.

Hopefully the admins actually use bitcoin donations legally. Otherwise it would be fairly trivial to get them for tax evasion.

I'd go with super shady.
Since Avalons were bought with bitcoins, theoretically, processing the refunds should have almost zero turnaround time as soon as you have the refund addresses, right? Isn't that the whole point of using an unregulated internet currency? So that shady vendors can't pull the "paypal is holding up our refund requests" line?
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:18:53
You're not counting the people who sell their coins, and leave the cash in the MtGox account.

If bitcoin goes mainstream, don't you think the infinity consumer protection agencies will go haywire over the lack of chargebacks? They can't stop a person from doing it, of course, but they could theoretically force your payment processors like Bitpay or even MtGox to adhere to regulation?

Thought experiment:
What is the endgame of the technological arms race for bitcoin? Unlike gold, there's no way you can find more of it, so is it just going to be people dumping more and more money into the latest and greatest setups? Won't that defeat the purpose of decentralization if it ends up being a scant few massive datacenters mining all the coins?

Bitcoin's current total value is about $1.5 billion, most of which is never moved on any given day.
I think it's a stretch to think that banks are actually concerned at this point. Nuclear holocaust risk is probably more important to them right now.
