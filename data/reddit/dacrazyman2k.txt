Is it possible to split percentages to multiple wallets on the backend? 
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:03:19
Will be there tonight :D

First use case I could think of when I read this. Lol

Too bad the camera man fell asleep lol ;)

Through bitpay I can split BTC and FIAT. Obviously not possible through gear as its strictly going to btc wallets however if I could do a percentage split I can setup an auto-convert wallet at an exchange and have a percentage go to that wallet. I know its not a common situation but I thought I'd ask. 
Other case would be where perhaps multiple people own the shop and split profits so each owner gets 50% etc... 
I will definitely be playing around with this a bit :)

This really depends on what your gains on the investment would be vs your interest being paid on debt. Bitcoin gains over the last few years have probably outpaced most average debt levels.

You're right, beside the USA there are no non-european countries listed anymore. 
This makes sense, as shakepay who also issues debit cards is no longer allowed to issue outside of the EU. 
Hmmm

Bitpay ships to Canada, I've had mine for a few months now. But you will pay an extra 3% on ALL Canadian dollar transactions, so its not really a good system to use.

I keep getting emails that hackers have video of me "self abusing" on my webcam and they are going to release it if I don't pay in BTC.
 Jokes on them, I don't have a webcam.

You need to hit refresh on your charts and seriously reconsider this question. Lol.

I really hope you're right. To be honest he seemed great and genuinely like he wanted to help at first however I haven't heard anything from him in two weeks, despite asking for updates.

I have my own wallet and the coins were sent from my wallet to the vendors bitpay wallet. The issue here is that this company who received the BTC is just not fulfilling their order and not refunding my payment.
@_date: 2016-02-10 18:53:55
Update: 
Received my refund today to my bitcoin wallet. Since this is resolved now, I will be deleting this post. 
@_date: 2016-09-03 06:31:17
Always great to see local shops accept btc, but first? ...
This articles 2 years old and even then was wrong for pointing out the "first" - 
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:38:13
Trading crypto is unregulated right now. Just do your trades but make sure to mark every trade and every Bitcoin transaction fee at the exchange rate of when the move was done, even if only moving between wallets

If anyone wanted btg, it would be easy enough to add it to btcpay.

I had Canada customs open a box full of legders once. They didn't ever actually open any of the individual ledgers, but the box. They also didn't seal the box with the traditional yellow "customs inspection" tape they normally use. Kinda gave me the sense they were hiding it. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:58:18
My suggestion is to get a legal business name that has absolutely nothing to do with bitcoins or crypto. Never mention it in your name. You become a target when you do and security is  in btms. Come up with an operating or DBA name that's cool but have your business name be obscure.

Just buy a bitseed. Login to it via SSH and install clightning or LND.

He will need to treat it as an investment/barter transaction just as if he were investing in gold. 
He will need to be diligent about recording purchase prices, transaction fees, and sale prices. All gains will be considered a taxable capital gain. 
He should also consult his accountant, as tracking all this can become a nightmare and his accountant might lose his mind. lol. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:06:53
To be fair, it would be more like the Canadian Dollar starting to call itself the US Dollar and then hitting people with shitty exchange rates and being like "Oh you spent the REAL USD, based out of Canada".

Jaxx is supporting the 2x fork. I would rather continue using bitpay if i wanted to go that way.

Canada Customs uses [Yellow tape]( to seal packages they have opened such as this. 
I do not see any yellow tape on your envelope. I don't dispute the fact that it was opened at some point, but most likely not by Canada customs. 
The bag it came in is standard for any packaging which has a hole in it or is damaged. It may have fallen out of the packaging and however picked it up thought "oh hey whats this".

I tried for about an hour today to add funds to my account as I always do with BTC however did not find an option. I talked to a rep who said they have temporarily stopped accepting it, but for how long no one knows. 
I guess I won't be buying anymore games for a while :( 
@_date: 2015-10-24 20:19:11
The bigger the company, the longer "temporary" becomes lol.

QuickBooks online supports bitcoin BUT.... And this is a very huge BUT.. 
The only allow transactions to have 2 decimal places. This makes using it a nightmare. I have been converting all Bitcoin transactions to millibits in order to mitigate this.

I purchased an item through purse instant once before and they ended up buying from a different seller on amazon (I'm assuming cause it was cheaper) who in turn drop shipped the product from walmart. 
It ended up that I received the wrong size, and when I tried to contact purse they washed their hands of it saying i need to deal with amazon or the amazon seller directly and they could not help me. 
I ended up selling it on craigslist at a loss and stayed off purse for about 6 months after that. Have used them twice since with no issue but I am not a fan of their customer service because of my issue. Good luck in your return!

Its for "microsoft account" which included xbox live and a few other services however I used it for Xbox mainly. I'm gonna try the gyft route tonight. Thing is I'm Canadian and the gyft route will give me a USD value card which I'm not sure I can apply to my account. Bitcoin was just so much easier. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:55:52
I accept Bitcoin in my business with BitPay. 0% fee to accept and then I mainly spend the Bitcoin using vendors who accept it.

If you find a way to add them still i'd love to know how because I was hoping to buy the new AC game today lol.

To be fair PayPal isn't including conversion fees in their diagram either. 
Fine print of the email reads: "Prices quoted here are the fees to send funds, but do not include currency exchange costs, which are additional. "

Hmmm I just checked on my mobile device and its there, however when logging into my desktop its gone. 
Edit: When clicking "redeem bitcoin" I have refreshed to a page which no longer has it available. 
Edit2: tried another browser on my phone, was able to create a bitcoin invoice with BitPay but once it was paid the website crashed. Funds have not shown up on my account page so I'm guessing it's not working because of that either. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:06:08
But the original ad was for Canada. No one wants our shitty dollar... So most likely if I'm sending international through paypal then I'm converting to USD or other currency
@_date: 2015-02-26 01:58:41
Actually the diagram doesn't include PayPal's forex fees. 
The fine print: "Prices quoted here are the fees to send funds, but do not include currency exchange costs, which are additional. "

How will BIP 148 affect Gear?
Will gear only be able to accept transactions from the "non-bip 148" chain? As a business that uses Gear, I want to make sure I am covered. 
I have a feeling I will simply be shutting down operations until an outcome is apparent.
