No, Bitcoin is the future. If he messed up the timing it's humane. We all do mistakes, aim for the bigger picture. Bitcoin is not about price.

Don't you remember the guy who ate his left ball when Bitcoin hit 10K? Shit was disturbing and I fancy my balls so I did not watch it, have had enough gore in my life already.

Holy shit, I am happy for you! Hope you make good use of the money, treat your family &amp; loved ones if you have any. Bless

Thanks Mike but lets be honest, what kind of a man am I if I can not even change my broken toilet.

I'll always have this memory now where nobody believed I saw a flying airballon with the face of Shrek.  
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:02:20

Thing is I am not joking, it was one of the oddest things to see. For a whole minute I paused my friday evening to just watch Shrek's face fly through the sky like a driveby.
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:35:31
No it is not. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:55:22
It's just how things will be during adoption. Banks will adapt and become obsolete in 15-20 years. They'll still be around but it will be taboo to use a bank because of the inconvenience.

Ruh roh shaggy, Bcash is creeping up on us.

Sadly, I think Bitcoin will become very controlled unless we work hard on making it as anonymous as possible.

Can't you just buy monero, switch wallets and come up with a story that you lost your money trading or lending to a friend? Or is it jailtime for that? If I make money out of crypto I'll move to a taxfree country, lol.

I am just repeating Andreas Antonopoulus words, you think he's wrong?

I live in a popular city in Sweden and I wish to get my hands on some Bitcoin stickers to raise some awareness to the general public. There are literally thousands of people walking outside my apartment everyday &amp; I could just sneak out at night on my way to the shop and relister it whenever it gets removed. Have noticed a trezor sticker around here but that doesn't help BTC very much.
Where can I buy some?
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:11:07
Does keeping BTC on segwit chain still grant you all the forked coins from Bitcoin? 
Ex: Btc private, bitcoin diamond, Bcash etc?
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:42:42
That's kind and all but you're getting used mate, have some respect for yourself.
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:12:38
