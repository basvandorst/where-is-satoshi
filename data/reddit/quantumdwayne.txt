I would really like clarity on this subject. No one seems to answer these kinds of questions and instead just obsess over the price. 
If Bitcoin can't figure out how to handle software upgrades without creating forks and tanking the market due to periods of uncertainty then the future of crypto will be very bleak as long as Bitcoin is dominant. 
Also, who exactly is on the Core development team? What are their backgrounds? Are these silicon valley level programmers or just a couple of guys who got in during the early days and now control the protocol?

The thing that gets me is that these features have been implemented by other coins for a long time. None of these are new or groundbreaking ideas. It's like Bitcoin is living a year in the past while everyone is trying to move forward but Bitcoin keeps bringing the market down due to uncertainty. Really hope this crap gets figured out in the most responsible way possible.
That's good to hear about the dev team though. Not exactly easy to find information about them.

There's quite a few people in Silicon valley who work on cutting edge artificial intelligence and machine learning technology. I don't doubt the ability of the core devs but there are a lot of extremely brilliant people in the valley.

Don't listen to these people. They don't know what they're talking about.

This. Just because someone has on a nice suit doesn't mean they're credible or even understand what they're saying.

What does this have to do with BitCoin?
