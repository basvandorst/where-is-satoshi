If I’m running bitcoind on Ubuntu by command line, how do I set the fee to be lower? A line in the config file or by bitcoin-cli command?

What site is this?

Thank you BashCo for your help.
Do any mobile wallets have coin control?

Bitcoin must be resistant to everything. If we can't handle Roger Ver, you think it can be resistant to governments?
I see this all as positive growth. Necessary tests. Don't let it get to you.

Full Nodes already using 1TB++ of bandwidth a month.
The more storage and bandwidth each node requires, the less entities can run them. This immeasurably decreases decentralization, for a currency that excels only as a decentralized currency.
Many attacks on Bitcoin are coming. The more decentralized it is, the more chance it has to survive.
It is easy to simply lift the block cap in the short term, but remember that Bitcoin is a system of trade-offs.

"BU Team releases better and faster version than Core!"
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:20:56
As a Core supporter, it's not RIP BTU. It's RIP BTU's attempts at becoming BTC. I wish them the best in their new currency, it's a free market.

Can there be any other explanation? 39% spoofed seems high? When the next zero day hits, we should do some more thorough testing. Hilarious if 39% of them are fakers!

Bitcoin might be ending

I have a (ex) friend who does... He's nuts.

Yea great feature...

I've heard they are seeing a surge of new customers and are racing to keep up with demand. Give them a bit of extra slack right now, 24-48 hours minimum to respond. Never had a problem with them that wasn't resolved.

Have you thought any more about joining the union? I posted more info in the break room, I honestly think we're stronger together and he won't retaliate.

Well ASICBOOST either provides additional financial benefit or it doesn't. If it does, I'd bet its being used. Bitcoin is a system of incentives, you can't blame anyone for following their incentives. So it appears we need to change the incentives slightly.

Yea you're kidding yourself if you think I'm running software demanded by miners. I'd rather no SegWit at all.
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:47:24
I'm not upgrading to software controlled by miners though (in 3 months).
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:37:16
Please stop spreading fud. Btc1 is not the reference client.

A previous transaction left 0.0001 change in one of my addresses, and now my wallet is trying to bundle that together, but it's not worth adding that ouput to the transaction as it increases the transaction size more than it's worth.

Full 20 years please

? Just expanding my point.
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:14:47
Can anyone confirm this? I feel like the Coinkite guys are smarter than this.

Thanks Jihan &amp; Roger

If you just updated your Bitcoin software, like everyone else in the consensus, this whole clusterfuck could have been avoided.
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:43:22
Can you explain this more? Www.segwit.co is not showing any of the support increase, so I'm confused if these miners are actually signalling SegWit or not. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:32:47
Keep up the great work! 
Please consider adding coin control (unspent output management) feature, thanks!

Neither yourself nor Digital Currency exchanges in Canada need to be registered with FINTRAC. You're free to use any exchange in the world, provided they'll accept your business.
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:39:55
You mean the rules the general consensus agrees on? My sense is only a small, vocal group of people want 2x
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:26:12
Really? Wow the facts sure got drowned out on that original thread then. I'm not even mad.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:02:57
If there was an even spread with people in the middle, they'd just be suckers and it looks they've all died off and chosen a side (fast or super slow)

Legit. I was in Punta Cana earlier this year and this would've come in handy to get some more cash.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:02:04
This doesn't look crazy to me or anyone's fault. The distribution makes sense. There's the cheap folks that don't care, and the people that do care (exchanges, brokers, websites, users on normal or above) that are all bidding for the next few blocks. All those bidding types are around the same area, which is "the price".
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:20:34
? Why would wallet software play police? If the protocol allows it wallets will support it
