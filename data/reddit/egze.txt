But why though, if you can buy for less fees on other exchanges? Never understood the love for Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:50:32
Is is really so complicated to do a bank transfer to the exchange? Takes me like 1 minute. 1.5% fee is way too expensive.

Sure, you can target only the addresses that you put in the file. Where you get them from, it's another topic.
@_date: 2015-08-08 09:05:14
sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev
@_date: 2015-08-08 08:49:45
How do you run it properly?
Just for experiment I generated the address 1HoSFymoqteYrmmr7s3jDDqmggoxacbk37 with passphrase hello.
I put 1HoSFymoqteYrmmr7s3jDDqmggoxacbk37 in addresses.hex, then ran "hex2blf addresses.hex addresses.blf".
Then I put hello in passlist.txt
When I run "brainflayer addresses.blf &lt; passlist.txt" - nothing happens.
@_date: 2015-08-08 08:59:58
Sorry, you asked how to compile. I had to:
sudo apt-get install gmp
sudo apt-get install dh-autoreconf
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
and then just "make all"
@_date: 2015-08-08 08:57:34
I figured it out, I need to put the Hash 160 of the address to addresses.hex
@_date: 2015-08-08 13:36:40
install git
@_date: 2015-08-08 09:30:14
See my instructions above. .blf is the bloom filter file generated from addresses in hex by running "hex2blf addresses.hex addresses.blf"

When is Monero support coming?

Because some people prefer to pay with bitcoins, why not take it? It's not a bad thing to convert it to USD instantly. It's just a reality right now that a merchant has to pay the employees in USD or order stuff in USD. Having bitcoins in his account is no use for his business, it's actually quite risky. He is not into speculation, nor he cares about bitcoin economy. He just wants to have a business that pays the bills right now. Just think about it from his point of view.
@_date: 2013-06-13 20:45:42
Have a look at BitPay. Straightforward, easy integration and best support!
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:55:15
Just asked the management for a special deal for you guys to celebrate the launch. Whoever makes the first booking with bitcoins - will get a coupon for 50 euros (I know you would prefer BTC, but just not yet).
Message me here to claim your reward!
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:57:29
What a terrible advice. Get new friends only because they don't understand bitcoin? Really? I have friends who don't give a shit about bitcoins, so fucking what?!
@_date: 2013-06-12 07:44:37
I don't think so. This has never been a problem.
@_date: 2013-06-13 07:35:10
Mt.Gox. Had no problems with buying (SEPA deposit). But withdraw took about a month.
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:49:07
No worries. It's rewarding enough that people get to see what my team did! We worked very hard on this.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:27:52
Nah, just you being stupid, that's all
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:44:47
Feel free to message me tomorrow. I've done a hosted checkout on the weekend and can answer your questions. I'm also from Germany.
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:51:28
Thanks! Where do you ship from? I'm from Europe and wouldn't want to pay import taxes.
@_date: 2013-05-12 14:59:56
I'm Russian. Send me a PM
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:39:07
Message me if you have any problems with either paying or receiving bitcoins. I'm a dev at 9flats.
I'm on vacation now but I'll read reddit every now and then.

What would be a big enough amount to not use them?

Why does bank account validation to withdraw funds take so long? 4 days already.
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:57:24
bitcoin.de lists moneybookers as a payment method
@_date: 2013-06-11 06:44:30
I thought so too at first. But it's legit.
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:23:29
I make payments with the blockchain app on my iPhone just fine
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:33:02
Too bad they don't support Europe
@_date: 2013-05-29 22:59:06
Cool. Thanks
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:46:23
Do you keep the coins or use something like BitPay to cash them out immediately? If you keep them, how are you dealing with the taxes?
@_date: 2013-03-26 08:30:03
It's easier to just buy them.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:29:21
hmm, I'll fix it. thanks
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:32:02
Not possible yet. But I'll make sure that the management knows there is demand for it.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:20:42
Go for it!
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:10:49
Pic of the puppy or it didn't happen. Also, congrats!
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:13:16
Yes, now you can also receive BTC as payment! 
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:51:49
It is not so easy to open an account in other country. You can't just go to Switzerland and say "can I have one account please?". A 35 year old european mechanic can't do it.

If you can rent your room or apartment, you can get paid in BTC on 9flats.com
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:26:41
This post is not about that
@_date: 2013-06-24 06:41:48
Great. Will check it out during btclondon.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:27:53
To each their own. I just like my iPhone more than any other phone. Also I have no problems with the blockchain app, it just works (don't need to import my private keys)
@_date: 2013-06-20 18:51:27
Why do you think that it was legal to accept your cash without personal information in the first place?
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:20:07
There is a tax on lottery wins. Depends on the country of course

Can anyone comment how reliable this shop is? Not being a dick, but too many scams lately.
@_date: 2013-07-11 22:23:51
What's your first impression of the interface? Do they send you an EC-Card by mail? What ATMs can you use for free?
I'm thinking of opening an account there too.
@_date: 2013-05-21 07:12:10
Still waiting for my SEPA transfer for 2 weeks now. Support told me that it may take up to 3 weeks.
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:30:16
BitPay is a great company! As a developer who integrated different payment providers - their API was the best thing I've seen in my life! Their support is brilliant too, always fast answers.
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:13:15
Nice try, coworker!
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:01:41
Huh? Just installed blockchain app from the app store.
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:53:17
There is this transaction fee. As a miner, how do I get this fee? Never mined before. If I mine in a pool, does it change anything? Does the pool get this fee?
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:12:36
We now went all the way! 
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:01:01
cool. hope you get your problems fixed.
@_date: 2013-03-30 14:07:37
Try BitPay. The will convert bitcoins to USD for you during the transaction, so it's zero risk for you.
@_date: 2013-03-25 08:08:47
I think it only makes sense to give a discount for the transaction fees saved, compared to credit card or direct debit fees. Other that that, it's not in the interest of a merchant to help the Bitcoin economy. Merchants have enough risks already, a lot of them are struggling just to break even.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:51:26
It's back

@_date: 2013-04-22 17:42:04
Any high volume daytraders here? What's your strategy to buy/sell? How do you catch the moment?
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:07:03
It's on the TODO list! I will let management know that people want it!
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:29:13
I want to get maximum amount of BTC for the money, or sell it for maximum amount of money.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:40:04
I need both
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:43:22
Holy shit. I just want to punch his stupid face.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:13:38
Good news! Now you can also receive BTC as payment! 
@_date: 2013-04-04 23:47:24
I want it myself, and I'll do my best to push this idea forward!
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:33:58
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:48:32
People will stop depending when there are more solid exchanges out there. Right now, sadly, there aren't many.
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:23:12
Old news :) 155 already
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:45:24
I'm from Germany too. I do everything with Mtgox. You transfer euros to their account in Poland, almost no transaction fees, and then you're good to go. Only catch is - takes a while to verify your account. Took me a week. But I don't mind, better to do business with a trusted platform.
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:36:58
Look for instant booking flats. 
The reason we take bitcoin payments only for these types of flats is because we can't pre-authorise a bitcoin payment during your booking and take your btc later when the host accepts it.
Hope it helps.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:44:12
Thanks for the tip!
Idea came alive last week. I wrote the CEO that we need it now, he loved it. He is following the bitcoin market as well. And now a week later here we are :)
My hands are still shaking after the deploy. I'm very happy to bring bitcoins to so many people!
