Your response really highlights a problematic idea that is pervasive today, essentially, that everyone's opinions and ideas should be treated equally. My "take" (that astrology is bullshit) isn't just my take -- it's the accepted "take" of the educated masses that appreciate scientific evidence for making claims based in reality.
I know this sub has a lot of memes and silly things, but we really, really don't need posts that are this moronic.

The fees at exchanges are relatively low. GDAX, for example, is 0.25%

This is simply not true. This is how long term capital gains work: 
If you hold the BTC for over a year, the maximum you will be taxed, regardless of your tax bracket (even if you profit 1 billion dollars) will be 20%.

Oh lordy. You seem like a nice enough guy in your comments, but holy shit you must be dumber than a rock of you actually believe this nonsense.  I never thought I'd have to say this but the Bitcoin community would do well to stay far away from moronic mysticism like this.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:16:18
If you hold on to your BTC for at least 1 year, then it will be taxes at the Long Term Capital Gains Tax rate, which is 15% for most people, and up to 20% if it really goes to the moon. Still a lot, but definitely not 50%.

This is slightly different than the blackjack scenario, but I definitely see the resemblance. In blackjack you should never take "insurance" because it is sub-optimal, and you should live with the outcome because in the long-run it will be better. I get that. The difference is that you get to play hundreds of hands of black jack, so the law of large numbers comes into play. However, if you are playing a single hand of blackjack for $100k, you might want to take into account the utility of the money, and take the insurance if you still need to buy your flight home.
Let's say the current price is $17000 per bitcoin. Let's say you currently have $17000 to spend. Let's say you estimate that BTC has a 50% chance to (linearly) drop to $10k over the next week and 50% chance to (linearly) rise to $20k over the next week. There are 3 options:
1. Buy all now
 
2. Buy all in a week
3. Dollar cost average over the next week.
For option 1, you immediately spend all your money and buy 1 BTC.  In the end you are guaranteed to have exactly 1 BTC, and it will be worth either $10k or $20k, for an average of $15k.
For option 2, if it goes down, you will be able to buy 1.7 BTC at $10k, or 0.85 BTC at $20k. This obviously leaves you with an average of $17k, since you bought at the end.
For option 3, if it goes down let's assume you buy in equal amounts at ever thousand. You will be left with 1.29 BTC at $10k or 0.92 BTC at $20k, leaving you with an average of ~$15.7k.
The results show that option 1 turned out to be best when it went up, option 2 turned out to be best when it went down, and option 2 was also the best on average. However, option 3 is better than option 1 on average.
The main problem in real life is that deciding between options 1 and 2 is not easy. Here option 2 turned out to be the winner, but if instead of 20k, it went to the moon, then choosing option 2 would have left you with much less BTC than options 1 or 3.  I understand that if you come up with an ensemble for what the market can do, then you can calculate the optimal strategy to maximize average profit, but this is unrealistic since I have no confidence in my ability to predict the market. Choosing option 3 allows me to have some skin in the game regardless of if the market goes the way I think it will (and it performs better if it goes against the way I think it will).

No dude, you're misunderstanding Canada's tax laws. Please read up more about it if you're dealing with this much money.
50% of the profit (which you correctly point out is essentially all of it)  is taxed (not at 100% though, this is where you are making your mistake). 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:39:07
It is a little misleading to say "'Dollar Cost Averaging' is never optimal mathematically." This is technically true, but isn't very helpful since we don't have accurate market predictions or estimates of how it will change. I haven't read the papers you're referring to, but I assume that the statement is proven asymptotically on average for a given mathematical model. But just because it isn't optimal, it doesn't mean there is another strategy that is strictly better. You say either don't buy any or spend it all now, but we don't have crystal balls so we don't really have confidence in which way the market moves.
The point of dollar cost averaging is that we sacrifice the optimal amount of profit in order to have a more advantageous cost-basis if the market moves in the opposite way that you're expecting.
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:30:07
Possibly.  But I also think you're underestimating what can change in a lifetime.  Imagine what your great-grandparents where telling each other when they were kids.  They for sure weren't saying that the internet and cell phones were impossible, but because they couldn't even imagine them.

BTC-E says:
"Identity verification
Required in case you choose to load your account by wire transfer.To comply with AML/CTF recommendations, we require our clients to verify identity by providing scanned copy of ID and scanned copy of utility bill or a bank statement which should not be older then 6 month. Copy should be in good resolution and colored."
Shouldn't that mean that if I don't want to do a wire transfer I won't need to give them any information?

This would be a good question if you weren't able to easily convert $USD to ฿BTC and vice versa.
But since you can, there is a serious flaw in your line of thinking.  The obvious solution is to just buy however many bitcoins you just spent...
For example, if you want ฿10 in your savings, and you spend ฿1, then just buy ฿1 to replace it.  This has the added benefit of being good for the bitcoin economy.

What fees do those sites generally charge?  Because for people in the USA, Coinbase only charges 1%, but that still leaves the problem of connecting your bank account.

Thanks for running the numbers, a 75% loss seems about right.  I already gave him the advice to buy BTC, I was just curious as to why the miner contractors on ebay have such positive feedback.  the only two options I can think of are that either they are fake reviews or that many, many people are bad at math.
Although, now that I think about it, the second option seems likely since those with enough sense to avoid these mining contracts won't be leaving any reviews obviously.
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:52:36
1.  If you're living paycheck to paycheck it might not be wise to invest in cryptocurrency.  If you can't handle losing that money you need to think twice about investing.
2.  You would be much better off buying the bitcoin than trying to mine.  MUCH BETTER.  There will also be 20 more comments that say the exact same thing in case you are still unsure.  :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:16:20
If I were to go to a Subway that accepted BTC, would it be feasible to pay using my coinbase account?  Wouldn't the verification take too long?
If that is the case, then I would be better off transfering the coins I plan to use to a personal wallet where I can control the transaction fee, right?
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:43:17
Yeah, basically all I'm saying is buy low sell high.  The problem is that it's impossible to know what "low" and "high" are given that you don't know the future.
To sum up my advice, hold onto all of it, the day trading can be fun but won't really matter and you wont make additional money that way. The only real gains and losses will be because of the gains or losses of BTC with regards to USD, not because of your day trading skills.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:51:50
It's not accurate; you are still supposed to pay capital gains if you purchase goods with btc.
@_date: 2013-12-15 09:32:41
Sorry I didn't mean to scare you away, if you have a spare $50 then by all means invest!
For $50 you can buy roughly .06 BTC right now.  So now your decision of how to acquire bitcoin comes down to only one thing: will you be able to mine more than .06 BTC for $50.
(It is IMPERATIVE that you understand that the last paragraph holds true REGARDLESS of what bitcoin is worth in the future.  If you don't understand why I'll be happy to explain further.)
The current rule of thumb is that for normal people you can buy more btc than you can mine for the same price.  I don't know about the ebay contract stuff, maybe you should go for it and report back here in a few days.
As for your comment below about "acquiring" the latest KnC and having utilities included in your rent, then yes, obviously it is worth it to mine because the initial costs are already sunk.  If by "acquire" you mean "steal" or as given to you as a gift, then you will make a very nice profit.  If you mean acquire as in "buy", then you will most likely never mine the equivalent ($13,000 = 15.8 BTC).  (Even if you end up making a "profit" because the value of BTC went up, it would still have been the wrong choice because you would have gotten more by just buying.  :)
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:25:16
To be honest, at this point it probably isn't worth it if you have numerous employees you'd have to train.
However, in addition to the benefits you mentioned (smaller fee, more customers) there is one more potential benefit.  If you held on to some of the bitcoin for the long-run (instead of instantly converting it with bitpay) you could see your revenue multiplied if things go well in the bitcoin market.  This strategy would be tough though since you have salaries, rent, and materials you need to pay for every month in USD.  But if your margins are high enough you might want to think about it.

@_date: 2013-12-10 21:47:13
Because of the way percentages work that would hardly help.
A 99% fall from $100 is down to $1, and if that were to increase by 199% it would be only up to $2.99

The important thing is to compare it with how much money you would have if you had just purchased bitcoins instead the miner; in which case the price of BTC is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:15:12
I think you need to think this through some more.  Explain exactly what you're trying to do and why it would matter how much you bought the bitcoin for.

Seems really useful.  I just need to set a low price alert and this will let me know when bitcoin is effectively on sale.

If we assume that bitcoin survives for the long haul and has an upward trend in the long run, then yes, absolutely.
At the same time, just because every previous crash has recovered and gone to new heights doesn't mean anything if there is a permanent crash to take it all away.

Sorry, I really don't mean to be pedantic, but changing the wording to 'exponential' doesn't change anything.
Say we have the exponential function y=e^(x).
For 350=e^(x1) we see x1 = ln(350).  Similarly, for 3500=e^(x2) we have x2 = ln(3500).
So the time difference between these two y values is x2-x1 = ln(3500)-ln(350) = ln(3500/350) = ln(10).  Thus with an exponential function, the ratio is what is important, so the time between y=350 and y=3500 is the same as between y=3500 and y=35000, regardless of the base of the exponential function.
I think I'll just leave it at that because I'm pretty sure you understand. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:22:21
How far in advance are you going to post the deals?
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:19:12
Yes, actually you can.  A 10-fold increase from $350 to $3,500 would have the same slope as a 10-fold increase from $3,500 to $35,000 **regardless of the base of the log.**  
That is the entire point of logarithms.  If you need more help understanding I can explain further, but here are some useful properties of logs: 
@_date: 2013-12-15 09:51:31
I guess I understand it from the buyers side; the expected value is negative, but there's a chance for a big payout.
But I don't get understand it from the seller's side.  He has a lot of processing power, and he could have a fairly guaranteed steady income by dedicating this power to a pool.  This way he also saves all the hassle from posting on ebay and dealing with customers.  The only thing I can come up with is that he is grossly overpricing the contract to the point where it is worth it to him. (Which is fine, if people are willing to pay and understand what they are getting out of the contract.)
@_date: 2013-12-15 07:34:24
Get a PS4 and have fun with it.  The mining rig will not pay for itself, regardless of an increase in bitcoin price, because you could have just bought BTC to start with (opportunity cost).
Reading your comment below, if you think buying bitcoin is incredibly complex, you really really shouldn't get into mining.  If you didn't understand my comment above about opportunity cost, you really shouldn't get into mining.
The only way I could see mining being a suitable option at all is if you're in the middle of nowhere, with absolutely no way to purchase bitcoin; no possible bank transactions and no possible transactions in person.  In this case then mining might be the only way for you to get some bitcoin, so it could be worth it.  Just know that even though $1,499 is around 1.84 BTC, you will be lucky if you ever mine half of that.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:03:23
That doesn't change anything.  Since the conversion between BTC and USD is fully liquid, when you buy something with bitcoin, you would only buy that something for 1BTC if it is worth $856 to you (right now).  This principle holds true regardless of what you bought the BTC for.
To state it another way, if I have 10BTC, it is worth a certain amount of money regardless of what I purchased it for.
These principles can be challenging because they're not psychologically intuitive, but they have been thoroughly studied in the field of economics.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:54:32
The important thing is to look at it from the buyers perspective.  He gave bitcoin to somebody, then he got a car.
Maybe he wants to be off the grid, or doesn't trust banks, or for whatever reason, he wants to use bitcoins instead of USD, and he did.
Imagine if every retailer started using bitpay tomorrow.  Then you could effectively go to any store, say Target, and buy things with bitcoins.  From the buyer's perspective it doesn't matter that the third party converted it and the retailer never saw the bitcoins.

But not just very small, so small to the point where you can't even comprehend it.

There's nothing wrong with this plan since you are young and it's only $3000.
If this were instead your retirement plan (or substantially more money), this would be a terrible plan.  Diversification of your portfolio isn't just a thing people say for no reason, you really need to do it for long-term savings.
Your plan to sell the long term investment sounds good in theory, but you can't tell if "the market does appear to be crashing."  If you sell all of it when the price cuts in half, there is a very good chance that the market might just bounce back up again, so instead of selling them you should have bought more.
Basically, since we're dealing with a small amount of money, I don't think panic selling should be part of your plan at all.

Personally I use bitbook.biz and it was been great so far.  Over on bitcointalk they have a large thread going on.
Keep in mind that you are trusting your bitcoin to someone else, so what you should probably do is keep your balance there very small.  Withdraw big wins, and deposit relatively small amounts.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:58:12
I'm not sure you understand the concept.  This feature would allow you to keep your current holding of bitcoin at the same time as spending it.  For example, if you have 10 BTC now, you would still have 10 BTC after your purchase since it instantly buys the amount of BTC you just spent.
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:03:26
If you already have your life savings in bitcoin, you might not want to invest what little you have left also in bitcoin..
It's similar to how you don't want to have a huge amount of your portfolio be the stock of your company.  Cause if the company goes down you lose your investments as well as your job.

I thought you were saying that the increase "*from 1 BTC = $3500 to 1 BTC = $35,000 faster than from $350 to $3500*" and your reasoning was because of logarithms, but logarithms would show them being the same amount of proportional increase.
My apologies if I misinterpreted your original statement.
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:58:50
I actually just checked, and you're right, they do have recent positive feedback.
But something still seems fishy.  Why would a person sell a contract as opposed to just mining himself??  When taking into account opportunity costs this seems like a zero-sum game, so the person selling the contract and the person buying the contract can't both be making more money than they otherwise would be...

There are a few other quality sports betting places too.  NitrogenSports comes to mind, because you don't even need an account, every bet you place just works on its own, and if you win it'll send the money back to whatever address you paid with.
I personally chose bitbook since they seem to have the best odds.  From what I've seen they use the odds from Pinnacle.
