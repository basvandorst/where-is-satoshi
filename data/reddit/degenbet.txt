meh, it is about classic we all know it, that is the context of the (I think im at tedx but im on the internet) medium post. When it is not about classic it is about whatever the new bip or rebrand of xt is, xt-classic-whatever new rebranding. Also since not everyone and their mother are bitcoin nerd freaks some things need to be written in a way that people can understand. Most people have no idea what the f a fork is. Therefore in an effort to appeal to the masses it was in fact technical dumbed down.
"Finally, I’m going to limit this bet to the first hard fork that occurs in the next 12 months from the date of this post. I think there will be at least one during that time, but if not I don’t want to leave this bet going on forever. If no hard fork occurs during that time, then there is no winner." 
ok fine, lets revist this in a few more months.

Indeed,  There is a risk reward to paranoia and ideological Jihad. Did the "I no teamspeak cuz open source" do a lot to promote the Jihadist open source movement? I dont think so. Did someone miss out in taking part if prob the best open discussion unedited and easiest accessable segwit discussion do date? Yes indeed, but hey, teamspeak is anti-freedom and ultra smart people can not even use virtal machine proxy extra super safe things, instead a public ideloigcal holy war against a program is the way to go!

The road was created by software that is closed source. You have zero idea if that software had malware and created the road for you to die on. Therefore under your only "free" software or die argument you should not use said roads. There was software used by more than one machine to create the road.

Ok  league of legends 14 year old reddit poster. You have indeed confirmed how far up the Oliver prison wallet you are, good job!
Crawl farther up there , you are almost there.

You will not be able to find a hidden pot hole created by malware that was put there by terrorists in order to wage terror on core devs. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 10:10:50
Do you see that you might have to make a comprimise at some point. You are not going to get the source code to the machines that built the road, so we dont know if they had malware designed to kill us knowning what car we drive and how the brakes to this car I drive react to the angle of a curve or bump created by said malware. The risk reward, ideologal protest vs practical use of having a discussion in this case, should be measured. You will always have to trust something and will not be able to check everything. Is the teamspeak jihad really worth it? Is reddit on github? 
@_date: 2016-12-14 10:20:59
I see no reason how you can use a road. By using a road or sidewalk you have comprimised on software. You did not check the software that the machines used to create the road or sidewalk. You have zero idea if the road was designed to kill you, and aimed at getting your car to crash because it was designed to, or because it had malware in it. - A reason to comprimise would be to , meet people online in order to discuss things. Is using a virtial machine a violation of this XxHardlinexX codeX ?

Idiot reply from some idiot likely up the prison wallet of Olivier. 
How dumb do you have to be to keep buying what Olivier is selling?  
Pertty damn dumb. 
XT DoA Classic DoA BU DoA 
@_date: 2016-12-14 09:54:38
oh, you mean open source.
Then I guess you cant be in the discussion, too bad. Couldnt you make some super duper safe virtual machine proxy thing and use it anyway or is this an ideological jihad? Is this Jihad worth not being in the conversation? Is it going to really kill you to set up another machine to use teamspeak, ok I guess so. Hardliners do change the world , sometimes. I get it, kind of. Do you do this for hardware too? I dont have the source code for a car, the software of the car, or a plane, and I could die by using it.
@_date: 2016-12-01 10:02:51
Ha ha you are adorable crawling up inside Olivier. It is warm in there? Are you able to play League of Legends that far up his prison wallet? Damn check out that BU hashrate and mass adoption, it is amazing. It is clear that BU is what everyone wants. Thanks for explaining that to us!

How much did bitpay spend on the bitcoin bowl? I dont think that turned out very well, so we have a concrete case we can look back on to see if some kind of mainstream appeal to save on fees works. It doesnt. Bitcoiners are like dudes that try too hard to get a Girl they like, it wont work so just stop.

Yep , only not understanding the point. Please quote the part where there is someone telling people to use coinbase for betting? It is not there and you can not read. It is in fact the opposite, but since you are so smart and know so much I guess you read that. Your "creds" mean nothing, you have shown you can not read and like 17year olds.
@_date: 2016-02-04 00:33:22
Indeed, 
over at bookmaker they have CAR -5.5 at -105 or 1.95 and DEN +5.5 at -115 or 1.87 100K Limit on betting the spread. They are a long standing book, accept bitcoin and give you a Deposit Bonus.

Yes you read right,  "for all your degenerate needs"
@_date: 2016-02-16 13:35:17
OMG no it was mostly about how you didnt read. Also about how you are trying to use creds while being annon. Good job there, so continue with your 17yr old fetish dreams.
@_date: 2016-02-07 21:57:45
It does require some research into the sport. Lets say you think figher A is going to Win but only pays 1.25 , but a prop bet "fighter A wins via tko" pays 2.5 and "figher A wins via submission" pays 5.25 , and "fighter B wins via tko" then you can caculate the ammounts to place on each bet so as long as one of the outcomes hits you are in profit

There is no decentralised way to bet on the super bowl. Even if there was a prediction market you would still have to trust the Oracles. The closest thing is DirectBet.
You do not need an account and each bet as a different bitcoin address. Here you can read an interview with them:

There are 2 links to Brain Armstrong´s twitter. These are embeded, on one is a link to his medium. With these links you can figure out what is going on if you do not understand. Furthermore there is a link to coinbase and the coinbase tos.

Yes this user above that CLAIMS to be a compliance officer of a bitcoin MSB, they have some major metal problems that have to do with 17 year olds.
@_date: 2016-02-06 21:26:35
Is it open source? Keep that in mind people. The idea is to get rid of middlemen and gateways to connect people to the content providers. Closed source is just another wall that needs to be broken down, not to mention the trust factor when dealing with online CASH. What happens when the regulators ask for a database or the founders go to jail? What data does it collect. We need CANT DO BAD , not WONT DO BAD, because degenerate humans, WILL DO BAD.

Credentialing using an annon account, using caps and trying to be a parent to reddit is the by book definition of being butthurt and crying for attention. Said person is the one on uppers.
@_date: 2016-02-03 23:30:39
The books listed are good. However 5dimes takes bitcoin, and offers better odds than the other books listed.  
Currently -5.5 CAR 1.909 +5.5 DENVER 1.909 CAR ML 1.426 DENVER ML 2.950  o/u 44.5 1.909
I also want to point out that 5dimes has the largest ammount of teasers, parlay, pleasers, action reverse, IF bets and other bet types that some others do not have. If you like Denver and the Under then a 7 Point teaser would be nice, or maybe Car and the Over with a 7 pointer. Also you can choose "Teaser Ties Win" "Teaser Ties Reduce" which means that you are more flexable in your betting.
Found better odds than that over at bookmaker and they offer a deposit bonus. They are a widely known and respected sports book: 
You should also join the telegram sports betting group
I would say half of us are "bitcoiners"

Nobody is attacking coinbase, it is ironic that the CEO is trying to bet bitcoin with people even though he will not be able to use any account from the company that he started. This is also another reminder to everyone to treat coinbase as a bank and do not send anything to and from them that have anything to do with betting.
@_date: 2016-02-04 09:05:24
Yes I did comment that the odds are not as good as the best on the list. However there are a few things that both bookmaker and 5dimes offer for bitcoin and other users.  
*First of all I want to comment on the "end to end" term. 5dimes and bookmaker as well as many others are "end to end" - bitcoin in-bitcoin out."  
*The limits at bookmaker and 5d are much higher, as I commented on, this is an added feature.    
*The ammount of bet types is much wider and more flexable, wide range of differernt teasers,pleasers, If and action reverse. The question is two part, where are the best odds and the best most reputatble site that offers me the most flexablity. 2 Team 7 point "ties lose" (ties lose is only option at nitro)Super Bowl Teaser with the Spread and the Over Under pays 1.71 while a 6.5 point teaser(ties win) at 5dimes pays 1.78. (7point ties lose and 6.5 ties win is essentially the same)  
*Another thing to keep in mind is that if you use a site that converts into USD you do not have to think about my USD value while the games are on. Lets say you win my bet but bitcoin dumped so you more or less hedged my bitcoin position(If you won the bet) where as if you use a book that converts to USD value (just on a database, really not "converted to goverment currency as much as on any bitcoin exchange"). Now you can bet and not have to worry the whole time about hedging my bitcoin position and still you are able to use regulatory arbitrage to your advantage. Again you can deposit and withdraw in bitcoin, similar to using any exchange when trading.  
@_date: 2016-02-07 21:58:36
 can help you do this even though it is designed for sports betting arbitrage you can use it to help calculate the ammounts for each bet.

Mr. Armstrong is proposing a bet having to do with Classic. Where did anyone say it is a moral decision? It is however very ironic that he will not be able to pay the bet from a Coinbase account, dont you think?
@_date: 2016-02-16 13:21:10
you mean that they would chalenge people to bets in bitcoin that they can not pay from their own company? 
@_date: 2016-02-23 23:15:44
Yes of course, however if you read the text it is about the fact that Mr. Armstrong can not pay his own bet from a Coinbase wallet. Also new people that hear about bitcoin do not read fine print deep in TOS´s , yes that is thier own fault, however banning someone for sending 10$ in btc to a sports book to bet on the super bowl is not the best first impression of bitcoin. For people new to bitcoin it is in face not a no brainer.
@_date: 2016-02-18 20:14:34
He might be right who knows?
@_date: 2016-02-16 12:50:58
No he is not, read the medium article that he links to. He is betting in USD Value and in his PPS says it is payable in bitcoin. Bitcoins killer app is reg arb.
@_date: 2016-02-16 13:15:07
If you would like to have a conversation then stop using caps. You are writing like a typical 16 year old r/bitcoiner. It would be great if you could read. The point is that it is ironic that Mr. Armstrong is trying to bet people 5,000$ worth of bitcoin, which can not be sent via his own company since THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE.  IN SHORT LEARN TO READ YOU ANNON ARM CHAIR 16 YEAR COMPLIANCE OFFICER REDDIT PRO. Please please continue to fail in reading. This should HELP people remember that you should NOT use coinbase for anything gambling related but since YOU are such a SMART ASS I will TALK WITH FUCKING CAPS you are such an elite thanks for that "brcause" there is a lot at stake, maybe he should not offer bets in bitcoin that he can now pay from his own companies accounts? Or would you rather fill your 17year old fetish? Picturing all the people that you reply to here on reddit as 17 year olds that you need to punish. I think this officer has some DEEP issues...................

If the house wins, and you are just holding, then you lose, becuase you are only making one bet and hoping it is the right one while calling all other options stupid. This is the stupidist most iloglical non academic non sense crap. Regardless if you do not understand risk management and the massive risk that buy and hold intais you fail and butthurt post for ages about how bad trading is and that nobody can "win". Forgeting that trading is a skill a - a trade - that can be learned and it is not simply slot machine button pressing. Please continue to buy and hold, become a bag holder of X while you are dumped on.
@_date: 2016-05-27 10:13:50
All the people saying holding is the only way, were you holding from 600 to  160? With no hedge because "trading is bad" "It is just another form of gambling" . Holding bitcoin and not knowning how to long or short is a form of gambling that is the most limiting. 
* A lot of people that claim trading is "bad" tried to trade, lost money, now need to construct a narrative to justify their losses and damage to their ego. Regardless of whatever acdemic sounding hyperberliy that they are typing, it comes down to being butthurt.

Too late you already played the game you are long and unwilling to go in any other position. Your buying habits being one action or many are part of th market, you do not live in some kind of moral vaccum. You talk shit about trading but describe playing the lotto. Get off your high horse.

@_date: 2016-05-27 14:49:18
cost averageing all the way down is  trading, buying what you think is a possible bottom is trading. 
You looked at the risk reward and made an action based on it. That is trading.
