And the horrible spreads 
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:48:15
People fail to see this. 
Do people not understand why these Alts have been climbing? It’s because these coins represent an actual product/technology. What does bitcoin honestly offer?
It doesn’t offer anything besides a store for value and a way to buy into other alts. Bitcoin has not updated and changed with the times and the popularity its had.

Bitcoin is by no means anonymous

Congrats OP. 
You have enough money to start a great life that you may be able to self sustain if you invest wisely. 
Buy a nice house with some property, a frugal car and ensure your future off spring has money (or bitcoin) tucked away for college. Good luck op. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:02:51
Because bitcoin has a small (in comparison) 2mb block size 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:52:50
Hey thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:18:54
Things are different this time.  Millions of users are going to open up gdax and Coinbase and buy the new crypto listed when they see it cheaper than bitcoin and literally in green. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:59:00
Prove it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:02:20
Wow. Impressive. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:25:47
It doesn’t have the bitcoin name and isn’t listed at the top. They literally display bitcoin cashes price and graph in green lol 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:45:20
The only reason I like keeping them on kraken and Coinbase is I can seek my profit live. 
How’s the interface for this?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:03:00
Those can also be faked which regularly happens 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:37
HOLD. I mean look, Coinbase just added it to their app. Millions of users are going to open their apps to find a new currency called bitcoin cash and buy it. Maybe even sell their bitcoin to buy more BCH
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:16:36
You’d like bitcoin cash
@_date: 2014-11-02 17:53:19
Teach me how to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:33:47
I'm long on bitcoin by a few thousand. But I agree with this statement 200%. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:52:31
I'm saying I agree with what the person I replied to said. Not OP
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:48:07
Can you buy BTC on ellectrum yet?
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:30:17
I'd like to know too
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:50:06
Thanks ill check them out. Instant purchases and sells?
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:31:12
I own a one of a kind car. I predict the value wit sky rocket!!

Please pull forward to the next window.

My vote is the baby sitter is young, Just like most babysitters. She’s probably  just heard about bitcoin before. (OP didn’t use the word Nanny). 
A younger generation is probably hearing and talking a lot about bitcoin lately. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:42:36
On Friday at midnight I sold my $750 worth of ETH for bch. I’ve made $600 over the weekend just by ditching my eth that hasn’t been moving in weeks. 
I’ve since sold my bch at the perfect time, right before kraken was being real slow and bch was crashing. I’m a btc holder since $1,400 so I didn’t sell since I know it’ll probably return to previous levels 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:33:09
Slow loading webpages doesn’t necessarily mean slow hardware. I’d be more inclined to believe that’s a network issue 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:37:19
Because the site is being swamped with the same people that are doing exactly what you’re doing. 
The same thing has happened to Coinbase many times
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:48:40
Can you short or trade on margin?
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:52:18
Tell me this. 
When was the last time you could send a ~$7 transaction and not pay a ridiculous fee? 
Bitcoin was praised as being a great way to send money and pay for things like coffee. But the fees have been absolutely outrages with wait times of minutes to hours. Something about bitcoin needs to change. 
I’m not a Bitcoin Cash fanboy but I’d be lying if I said I’m not day trading it for gains. I own well more $ worth in bitcoins so no need to downvote an opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:16:17
Just noticed that. 
They’re profiting off this rally by increasing the “spread” similar to bid and ask prices with forex brokers
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:29:23
So if you fund your usd account you can then buy on gdax? Are there debit or credit card fees?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:09:19
And this is Bitcoins downfall. 
People touted that bitcoin would be perfect for paying for coffee and other things. Boy are we wrong about that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:01:01
Here friend. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:45:19
Why did he not charge or use it for a few weeks? 
Did Tesla offer any sort of repair or battery replacement. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:06:49
You have to post that as a parent comment 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:06:23
I’m not talking about buying or selling $BTC itself. I’m talking about actually sending a portion to someone. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:49:54
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:40:47
I just don’t understand why people don’t read the side bar or stickied posts. What’s your excuse OP?
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:19:18
Remindme! 3 years

What are we going to do without China? 
Fuck China?
Do you not realize the majority of bitcoin trading comes from China? 
China and only China is the reason for the recent enormous spikes. 
This sub was praising China weeks ago.

If I’ve had my bitcoin in coin base the entire time prior to the fork is it still possible to sell my Bitcoin Cash?
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:45:40
What app does this? I have an Apple Watch 
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:20:34

First step would be to read over the Will and see if he outlines the steps on how to claim and access the bitcoin. If not she should look over his computer for any text files or anything that would suggest bitcoin. 
Do him one last favor and clear his browser history for him. It's what he would have wanted. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:29:25
What exchange uses that? 
I used to trade forex and fees where very low like you mentioned. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 02:50:10
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:13:23

@_date: 2017-05-24 16:09:45
WHY wouldn't you even read the stickied post at the top of this page????
@_date: 2017-05-04 04:31:13
Any solutions that aren't $75+?
What's the cheapest way to buy relatively instantly?
I use Coinbase but their fees suck
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:04:13
Why don't you read the sidebar or the stickied post at the top? It would literally answer every single question
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:13:28
Thanks. I have plenty of bitcoin and plan on buying some of the bcc dip
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:12:19
It's ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:15:33
My coins are in an offline wallet. I want to keep the amount of coins I have and keep those as btc and buy bcc as well. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:12:29

Yes. Look at the hour chart
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:33:19
How do I buy BCC? Serious question 
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:13:51
You don’t know that
@_date: 2017-06-02 04:13:11
How can I purchase one of these?
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:51:10
ETH a scam? What evidence do you have for such a drastic claim?
Seems to me it's been out performing bitcoin lately. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:30:03
Keep them diversified
