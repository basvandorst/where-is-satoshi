I don't think he'd be in debt if he had over 1,000 bitcoins.

How long was it since the last version was released? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:24:13
Or the more likely option was that he was trying to trade and make a small fortune on bitfinex using leverage. 
Why would an early adopter in debt with 4 kids all of his 1000 coins on an exchange? He could have them cashed out or in cold storage and trade with just 20-50 on futures to avoid exposure. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 06:51:07
Ehh, they should have just used the name bitcoin and told the story. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:14:28
lmfao that was great, bubble just won't pop. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:46:39
What if I told you, it isn't bullish that people are willing to sell 1000 coins at a time. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:21:33
And Trump became President, scary analogy...
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:38:59

Lol, guy thinks congress cares who leaves the country. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:38:31
hes probably the greatest bitcoin speaker/ advocate, guy has gotten many people to get into bitcoin, happy to seeit's paying off for him. over 1m in donations now, awesome.
@_date: 2015-12-11 05:59:55
Even better, just delete the r/bitcoin subreddit so it doesn't even exist! 
@_date: 2018-09-28 03:42:47
I'm surprised this didn't happen sooner but then again 1broker never had much volume, was a good run. 1broker was great. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 04:24:43
Even then, if the ipo is hyped enough it'll continue to rise irrationally if the hive mind keeps buying, even through bad earnings, I've seen it happen many times. That being said, if you can time it right it could be an excellent short. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:26:22
Open letter- These open letters are fucking annoying.
@_date: 2018-05-18 15:20:10
He already was wrong about bitcoin, he was aware of it when it was less than 400$. He'll be wrong unless something catastrophic were to happen.
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:23:18
Would do the same in your position mate, well done on accumulating 100 coins.

It's a futures exchange, 90+% of the people using it are using a 20x leverage, so really it's about 15k  real BTC being traded there. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 11:30:47
Great way to spread the redistribute the coin/ spread adoption. Keep it up lads.  
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:13:42
Yes, but it's also what is keeping the price at this level in the first place.

Plot twist: Buffets right hand man is highly invested in bitcoin and is a part of the current FUD campaign trying to bring the price down, he also has high sell walls up on exchanges, in the mean time he purchases any and all amounts he can off market while cheap until they're all bought up, then he will lift his sell walls and begin buying on exchanges, to the moon, next bubble, we have lift off.

Then buy it. I bought my first bit of e commerce with bitcoin through these guys, everything worked flawlessly. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 10:00:04
It shows that there is very little people lending bitcoin  for traders to short, this is the first time I've seen bitfinex like this since I've been on here for a year. Just now,  some coins  have been added about 1k at a proper rate, 0.16 %. This is indeed a sign that BFX is running out of coins to short. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 22:31:35

There's literally no point in politicians even discussing bitcoins legality at this point. It's a waste of time for them to put any thought in bitcoin as it's currently such a small currency market cap wise.

It was in fact a short closing, which is even better news. 
This person Whale was probably short for quite a while, therefore he most likely was all in fiat, which now leaves him with at a minimum of 4k BTC purchasing power on finex if he buys 1k bitcoins and uses full leverage to go long, again that is minimum, he probably has much more on the exchange to be making these types of moves.

There was no drop to 280, your confusing the drop to 360. I think Bitcoin is very undervalued currently, don't see it going any lower than 400, I do think the bearish trend is coming to a close and a break out is coming any day now.

You're blaming one exchange that offers margin trading instead of the people who willingly lend and willingly accept loans to buy  more coins with leverage? Not to mention, a large percentage of bitcoins high price is due to leveraged trading.

No bulls left on stamp anymore since whales with a lot of BTC holdings push the price down on stamp by putting up large ask walls to discourage traders from buying. This is why you rarely see a lot of volume on the exchange besides 300 btc buys or sells. All the smaller traders have left to other exchanges, mostly bitfinex, not sure why my previous comment was downvoted as these are just theoretical posts.

Nah, this would have happened regardless of my post due to the crazy high rates, this is still bullish for BTC as this is the first time I personally have seen this happen in my year on finex and shorts hit a recent ATH.

I'd love to be able to use Circle since coinbase doesn't consider me a real person due to my lack of financial information since I've only had a credit card for a year, I've been unable to insta buy bitcoins for the last year using them and it's very frustrating for someone who enjoys trading. Can't wait till circle comes out, even if coinbase fixes their identity questions that are impossible to answer for myself since they're not correct, I'll be switching to circle and never looking back. Fuck you coinbase, lost over 1000$ due to these fucks making me wait 5 days to get my coin.

@_date: 2014-08-24 10:30:10
Posted this on a day ago ... I've since changed my position (have a lot recently) but I'm sure the bulls would enjoy my thoughts.
Just from watching the market the past week, I've noticed huge whale sells, followed by very little sheep sales each time, just now there was a 1.5k sell on stamp bringing us from 510 to 499, no one else on stamp sold, China had little reaction, finex bears attempted to break 495 resistance but only managed to go from 506 to 495.6 due to some stops going off.
Typically when we'd see a huge sell it would incite panic, this is not the case anymore. This tells me that selling among the regular folk, us sheep... is exhausted. What point do bears have to sell if they can't buy back cheaper?
This is just a thought of mine, I think we're in for a major rally.
Playing devils advocate I guess wall street bears could try and get rid of everyones usd swaps via margin calls by continuing to bring down the price, but with no one else selling, I don't think it'd be worth it for them to do so. For some more forced margin calls, Finex would need to get to the low 430s, BTC-E the low 350s by my rough estimates.
GL trading mates. let me know whether you agree and have anything too add or you disagree and why.
Edit, like usual, i'm wrong... seems like the bears are going to get rid of all the long positions.

This guy used margin/ leverage trading to open up a bitcoin short a while back which means he barrowed about 3k bitcoin from people willing to loan it for a fee, and sold it the coins once barrowed. After the price has fallen now he has closed the short thus buying the sold bitcoins back from the exchange for a profit.

I predicted the previous bull market at a price of around 285  and thought we'd top at 3k,  obviously I had no idea how high btc could go. With that said, I believe the bear market is over and we're in a ranging market. All it takes now is a catalyst, or institutions buying, more demand and bitcoin will be back in a bull market. Might be this month, could be in the next 6 months but I believe it'll be sooner rather than later.

Silk road was bitcoins first use case, btc wouldn't be anywhere near as popular today without the silk road, this is coming from a guy who doesn't do drugs and doesn't drink, been in bitcoin since 2013.

Person? Could be a group, could be a government, we don't know, also... they're paper rich, if satoshi were to start to even move any of their coins... it would cause major panic.

The market isn't liquid enough for Soros to make that much money shorting bitcoin yet, He'll need to prop up the market cap first.

You'll be right in the long run -2-5 years but you sir may have actually bought the top of this run, perhaps the bull market, hope you can endure a 1-2 year down turn and possibly lose up to 50% usd value. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 02:04:28
Disappointing to say the least.
