He chose the girl from a site (sugardaddymeet.com) which verified her as 18+. Now, the girl's counsel is claiming that she is 16. Interestingly, the judge is saying that the site is NOT responsible for verifying a 16 years old girl as 18+! According to the judge, the onus is on to the person having sex. I mean, what can be more mockery of justice than this?

Having sex is not stupid IMHO. He chose the girl from a site (sugardaddymeet.com) which verified her as 18+. Now, the girl's counsel is claiming that she is 16.

This is bad for good bitcoiners. Now bitcoin will be in the hand of terrorist organizations. Terrorism in USA will be financed by bitcoin from Pakistan.

Ok. So the first owner sold it to and then he sold it to I heard Craig Steven Wright had lots of shell companies in UK. Was Bitcoin, Ltd. one of them? Found an archived page as well -

Bitcoin is great for certain use cases. Airbnb IS one of those use cases. NameCheap.com, Gandi.net, BestHostFree.com are another use case. I can guarantee they're doing great with bitcoin and they wont drop it near future.
Of course the donation seekers try bitcoin from time to time. U cant expect bitcoiners to take them seriously. **Bitcoin is NOT for donation**. FIAT does well in that segment.

This is not new to Indian CryptoCurrency scenario. Mahesh Verma, founder of an Altcoin, known as The Champ Cash aka TCC, also faked his own death before fleeing to some other country.

Which every one of these sites u r talking about? If u r talking about CoinBase, Gemini, Kraken or similar ones, they're operating within regulated environment. Of course they report KYC details to govt, but that does not endanger the customer. But, the likes of Coindelta, Koinex &amp; Wazirx are reporting KYC details to the govt and thereby putting customers at risk. Because, in this case, the regulation is not in place yet.

Given the number of Indians involved in Crypto, this is very unlikely. But, Indians should always remember Crypto is unregulated in India. Already banks are closing down accounts related to Crypto. So, if u r going P2P, go without KYC, so that banks can't close your account all in a sudden.

Coindelta, Koinex &amp; Wazirx are nothing but KYC honeypot. People should avoid them like plague. LocalBitcoins, lately, is also turning into a KYC honeypot. People should embrace HodlHodl.com or bisq.network anyway. LocalEthereum.com is also a good alternative based on ETH.

It would be awesome for the network if it could be done. We'd witness thousands of nodes up immediately. Because all of us running on shared hosting are forced to rely on third party API.

Nothing can ever be 'lost' on bitcoin blockchain. Either your Tx gets confirmation and funds move to the intended receiver or your Tx is removed from all mempool and funds remain at your wallet.
