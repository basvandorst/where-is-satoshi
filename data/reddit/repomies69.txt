How can you be confident that aliens don't attack earth? OP didn't say anything about their confidence level. These things happen and it is impossible to have 100.00% confidence on anything. I think the best thing is to allow withdrawals as soon as possible so those who don't trust bfx can take their money out and never use their service again.

The more I read about LN, the more I'm convinced that it will be mostly theory, and nobody will use this stuff in practice. It is jsut too complex and the different scenarios/problems/fallbacks seem too daunting. With even simple bitcoin transactions it is too easy to fuck things up, LN looks like it increases the complexity 10x, which makes you 10x more likely to fuck up somehow.

AFAIK there isn't about ~any info on the actual vulnerability in public. And that might be a smart thing to do for bitfinex to give out as little info as possible.
Yeah, bitfinex used BitGo's 2-3 multisig for storing btc, with segregated account setup. So 2 keys are needed. They were probably the same keys as used normally in withdrawals. But not much else is known. BitGo hasn't given any statements either.
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:16:12

I think inside job is unlikely. Bitfinex was the largest exchange and basically a money-printing machine, so everyone working with the systems was probably well compensated. As an insider your changes of getting caught are big.

Whatever man. I have used bitcoin a lot, for many years, and I've also explained the workings to many other people, who have used it. With varying degrees of technical skills. The core concepts of transaction/broadcasting/confirmations is very easy to understand and use for most. LN seems to introduce a whole new level of complexity and issues where you have to negotiate between these channels.
When LN is "finished product", I won't be the first to try it out, and I highly doubt that even proponents here will be very eager to commit a lot of funds to it... It will need strong network effects and therefore I believe it will fail, at least how I understand the workings of it.
Btw I don't think in general there are "finished products" in software development. For example bitcoin in usability, security and stability is at whole different level as it used to be back in the days, when you still could basically do the same things as nowadays.
@_date: 2016-08-30 20:14:05
I think there was something similar to this, but for bitcoin predictions. And you predicted them manually. Of course you could use bots as well.

Well, those are actually systems that you can use TODAY, all this LN stuff is just design talk before the system is even live...

As I understand, most darknet escrow services are already like banks. You can receive &amp; send bitcoins to the wallets in them. You can also use darknet markets as exchanges, nothing prevents you from buying and selling fiat money (or other kind of financial services) there. The problem is the 5-10% escrow fee.
AFAIK "cash by mail" etc was already sold on silk road back 2011 or so, for bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-04-08 19:24:34
I guess no operator of any financial service feels safe, and the reward for that missing feeling of safety compared to normal person is the profits that the business makes.

Generally the problem with P2P trading is the verifying of your trading partner. While being decentralized offers benefits, it also means that if your trading partner is a fraudster you are on your own.
@_date: 2018-09-28 12:02:42
The escrow only guarantees only very basic transactional safety, the funds can still be from illicit source (or friendly fraud) and you can get problems days or weeks later. These issues can be tackled in several ways. I'm not really familiar with bisq but I would trade there only if I was very experienced about p2p trading.

How so? If I create some token that uses bitcoin address system, is every company out there that uses bitcoin required to honour the deposits of my token? That would also require them to import their private keys to my software, which could be seen as a security risk. At least there might be a lot of work involved.
It would be interested in seeing a court case.

That discussion is never going to end. He could also probably quite easily have made $250k.
People and companies are not stupid. It is a free market, everyone perfectly understand that there are white/gray/blackhats. These companies price their bounty programs according on how they price the risks. And vice versa the hacker/researcher decides what to do with the security hole after it is found. There is not much point complaining about which is the right price, just accept the market rate and go on.
I mean, I'm not very experienced with this market but the amount of complaining about the bug bounty prices I've heard is astronomical. I am pretty sure that the rewards are not going to change via moaning on the interwebs.

Well the incentivization is very basic - you send the list of nodes/relays/users to be priorized. Different lists could be defined for incoming and outgoing traffic.
For example, if you are using a route of 3 relays, you send biggest amount of BTC to the entry node, a little less to the one after that etc. Of course you incentivize a lot of other traffic as well. The point is not to create perfect system. However it is better than just pure donation (without getting anything in return).
For example, hidden services could priorize traffic for nodes which redirect traffic to them.
If you're worried about deanonymization, you don't need to use the system, you can just donate directly to the relays if you want.
@_date: 2018-08-02 12:54:35
I don't think there are mass blockings. LocalBitcoins has tons of users all around the world. That also means that they have tons of issues. Still there are lots of people using LB without problems. People come to reddit when they have problems, which is understandable of course.

The vault is great piece of technology, but is it a good business? I think only marginally so. It might lead customers to other products from coinbase, but it doesn't necessarily generate them much revenue.

I don't really see much advantage shere. The trust problem in this kind of situation (continuous micropayments to a service provider) isn't really that the provider runs with money. This kind of services usually depend on repeating payments and long relationships, so at one-time.
From realistic use-cases I could imagine SMS or email backend providers, which I use a lot in my line of business. I'm quite happy to deposit let's say $100 a month to them, and they they deduct the micropayments from that amount. In the beginning I was paying them something like $10 at a time. Currently the payment goes from my credit card or paypal. For the service provider the amount is quite small so the incentive of running with the money is also small.
With Bitcoin, I could quite easily see using similar model, just a simple deposit to the service provider who then keeps a "wallet" or service balance for you. I don't see the hassle of implementing this kind of separate model worthwile.

What's the point? This doesn't seem useful to me at all. Some might like the idea of using spare change to buy bitcoin, but I doubt that is a very small niche.

Signing the contract is stupidity, but isn't continuing the payments stupidity as well, in strictly nihilistic business sense? They probably can get away with a lot smaller loss when they simply break the contract, instead of paying.

I don't get it... The basics of payment channel is, that it ties capital up to the max amount that the sender could send (after that you need to open up a new channel). Impulse.is uses payment channels in some creative way, however as far as I understand you always need to have some btc tied to the multisig tx, however you plan to use them.

I'm not really sure if this is really good way to do this. What about trust, how do we guarantee that the servers pingers actually deliver? Why would I want to handle the payments invidually to each computer? As I understand there is some centralization already, as the requests go through the 21co market. Why wouldn't 21co take the payments, and also take care that the crowdsourced machines do their job?
Also, as I myself run a service that needs monitoring, the monthly subscription-based model is a bit more comfortable to me. The reason is that handling payments is work, and I don't want to manage some micropayments etc.

That is no argument, only a claim. Malleability is a problem, yes, but it doesn't prevent from using lightning network or payment channels. You are just pulling arguments out of your ass, and probably don't know what you are talking about.
In fact, I think basic payment channels are already usable in the current protocol. Just no one uses them. They are quite complicated to use. However lightning network concept has even more complicated systems to use, for example below is a screenshot from the white paper. I don't think it is going to be adopted anytime soon, because of the sheer complexity.

I found that explanation quite confusing. For example the part: "It is possible for the chains to converge if miners eventually put together an exclusively Orange chain starting from when the users accepted Yellow rules that surpassed the total work of both of the other chains."
Either converging as a term is wrongly used there, or the writer doesn't really know what he is talking about. There is no way in any sane blockchain system that chains would converge. Miners can mine multiple forks, they can change their mining power to the other fork, but in no way will the other forked chain ever combine to some other chain. The block graphis one-directional only.

Not a mixer, just some very rich user spending his bitcoins. When you make a transaction in the standard bitcoin client, there is a change address generated. So this guy has 9500 BTC in a single address. It means when he spends 1 BTC, the change address will be 9499 BTC. So it can also look like someone is spending 9499 BTC.

It is not that the service is bad, but because of some regulation issues or abuse, the hosting provider can just decide that they don't want you as a customer. Same stuff happens with banks.

@_date: 2017-04-24 10:26:25


Depends. An analysis could be done based on walletexplorer.com (or similar) that would estimate how much could be saved on fees. The reality is that many people use hosted wallets and don't care much about controlling their private keys. Especially when the amounts are small, the fees are also more important for smaller amounts (because % can be huge if you want to send something like $10 using btc).
Even though the use-case is limited to hosted wallets, if hosted wallets create less transactions, it would free the blockchain space for others. So it could be quite beneficial.

@_date: 2017-04-24 12:12:25


For users who don't want to use the hosted wallets this is still something worth pushing for, since the hosted wallets are quite popular anyway. And when you have the hosted wallets using less blockchain, for everyone else there is more space.
I don't see much downsides for getting this forward, it can be useful whatever happens with the protocol. Anyway the current situation looks like not much is happening any time soon so that makes it extra worthwile.
@_date: 2017-04-26 10:42:12
And banks make sure that you can pay back with collaterals, such as a house or stocks (from established company). I doubt that getting loans is very easy if your assets are in bitcoin/crypto, even as a millionaire. I haven't yet heard about banks that would accept bitcoin as a collaretal. And if they would do that, they would probably want to hold the keys.
The reason why businesses get the loans is that they have collaterals. Bitcoin or mining equipment highly probably doesn't work as collateral.
For example when I was negotiating a house loan private company stocks weren't any use as a collateral, even with ETFs and stocks the collateral value is something like 40%. Banks play it very safe.
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:10:17
Now that the ASICBOOST stuff is out, does that make Segwit somewhat more likely to activate? I think the answer to that isn't at all simple. In fact, I think now it is even more clearly that some miners (those with asicboost) will oppose segwit to the end, because they have strong financial incentive. Earlier I thought it was just ideological opposition, which is much easier to overcome.
@_date: 2017-04-27 07:21:58

KYC doesn't violate privacy. You have the right not to use a service which requires KYC, and use some other service instead. That way you can keep your privacy.  
A service provider can make various conditions on using their services, such as requiring KYC. Saying that services shouldn't be allowed to require KYC is not that far from something like commies saying that companies should provide products and services for free.

I knew that already. I just think that the incentives to work as a notary will be too small, if you can only earn fees through disputes. And anyway, the buyer won't be happy to receive his money back minus fees. If notaries could earn also on successful trades, they would have the incentive to promote only honest merchants. Now they have incentive to seek disputes.

Yet another ad hominem... Maybe try to argue your point instead of calling other people stupid? That makes me even more sceptical.
I can understand that some people want LN to succeed very, very much. I also want it to succeed. I wasnt second layer applications to develop. However I don't think they are getting forward by spreading bad propaganda about them. Calling LN having the "same security" as bitcoin is just very, very intrepretative. I don't think the security model can be the same at all. However that doesn't even matter because usable LN's don't exist yet...

Bitcoin won't replace M-PESA or other credit based mobile money systems. It is just so much more efficient to do this kind of payments via trusted third parties instead of blockchain.
Bitcoin is a great tool for offering "a way out" from the M-PESA - M-PESA doesn't work internationally. However M-PESA could soon have a great liquidity for bitcoin, meaning that people can make international purchases and online shopping very easily with M-PESA funds, with Bitcoin.
There is a nice amount of M-PESA traders in localbitcoins.

Well blockchain.info doesn't touch fiat. They don't even hold the bitcoin keys. It is entirely different service than an exchange.

LOL this is just plain idiocy. Why wouldn't the people on the legacy chain just set up a simple checkpoint to avoid the reorg risk?
@_date: 2016-10-29 06:24:19
"With the same security as Bitcoin"
That is just pure bullshit. LN (which we can't use yet easily) is a different system from bitcoin, although based on bitcoin. It might be even superior, or probably it is in some ways better, and in some ways worse as bitcoin. But exactly the same? No fucking way.
You are yourself spreading FUD by spreading this kind of claims which clearly are untrue. No wonder people are sceptical.
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:57:40


Bug or feature? Code is the law, said someone somewhere. The source code of bitcoin core pretty much defines the bitcoin protocol, and there is no wrong or right way to use it. Complaining about miners greedily using every possibility there is for profit is quite pointless. Instead should try to seek ways to scale bitcoin, that would be OK for everyone.
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:14:27

I don't believe segwit/LN is vaporware. They probably will eventually be implented and maybe even adopted at some extent. But I don't really think the benefits are worth the hassle.
Bitcoin development was supposed to be conservative. Why not let altcoins try out segwit and LN first?
@_date: 2017-05-16 07:14:04
It is quite easy for anyone create trade on localbitcoins where one bitcoin is traded with $1000000, while no actually fiat is moved. You shouldn't use the localbitcoins fiat trade amounts for conversions, but just take the btc amount and multiply it by some other exchange rate (bitstamp/kraken or something).

Seriously, this sounds like UASF promoters are causing problems for everyone as they are planning to do a chain split. I'm pretty sure no miners will mine this UASF-coin, but if it gets some minority hash rate, that for sure won't be called bitcoin.

How does the number of nodes matter? Anyone can rent lots of servers from amazon and put out thousand of nodes quite easily, however those don't matter at all if they don't process transactions.
What matters is the nodes that actually process transaction (as a receiver) - and from those nodes the ones that process more transactions matter more. The most important nodes are probably something like coinbase, bitfinex etc.
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:24:41
That's a good idea. Sell crap to these idiots who think that just having the nodes matter.
@_date: 2016-10-10 20:14:13
LOL no. Bitfinex is a company that has to comply with the laws. You were stupid if you thought that they don't do KYC/AML, all businesses need to do that if they want to stay in business.
But in all fairness they should've informed beforehand that they require identification, not until you already sent the money their way.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:44:03
Majority of services are running official bitcoin core, and won't switch to some alt client made by some nutcase. If some miner is stupid enough to actually mine bip148, then it will stay minority chain.
Let's say that the bip148 minority chain gets 10% hashing power (which I predict will most definitely not happen, but let's play). The majority chain keeps chugging on. Exchanges/services have processed the transactions properly from the majority chain, and at some point realize that there is some nutty minority chain, and want to remove the risk of reorg. No sane exchange would switch at that point to the minority chain. However they would probably want to ensure that those chains will stay separate, to remove the risk of reorg. Adding a checkpoint is a very simple way to do that.

Whaat? Why would miners be altruistic? Why would anyone make that kind of assumption? That would be very stupid assumption... If group of miners make extra $100 million/year with asicboost (or even $10 million) you have to be pretty good at convincing them that they should throw those millions away and hope that segwit provides better value for them... And I'm pretty sure that many people wouldn't act that differently in the same situation...
And I don't know if it is an attack, more like a loophole in the protocol that the miners are exploiting. It is kind of stupid to except people not to exploit all exploitable loopholes in the protocol there is...
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:43:30
1. Check if the transaction shows up on blockchain.info (search with address)
2. If not, contact localbitcoins support. If yes, then the problem is with multibit. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:30:24
For exchanges, miners etc the reorg is a fucking huge risk - there would be most definitely a strong motivation for every service to put that checkpoint there.
However that is very theoretical scenario, because I think the likeliness of UASF fork getting even one block is pretty much zero.
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:01:05
Shouldn't bitcoin core first do a release that has UASF? I don't see it going far if UASF isn't supported by bitcoin core.
Additionally, I would wait for the actualy UASF support in these wallets as well. August 1st is quite close.
@_date: 2016-05-15 06:57:29
Nah, they send messages "pay us X BTC and we'll stop the attack". It never makes any sense to pay. But some stupid companies probably keep paying, because these script kiddies keep doing the DDOS'es.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:44:44
Also have to add that the timescale is so thight, that even if this UASF crap would be supported by core, still majority of services wouldn't probably upgrade within this time.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:18:32
Well I'm sorry if I insulted you but I just can't understand why miners would mine this BIP148Coin. And the ones that promote UASF on reddit sound like religious fanatics omitting rational thinking.

Miners just voted no for segwit, can we deal with it and move on? I think it is unlikely that miners are going to accept segwit on second voting round, or any round for that matter, if they have a financial incentive (asicboost or similar) to not signal it.
@_date: 2017-05-18 06:41:18
It is not internal politics, the reason is that there isn't any consensus on any scaling solutions. Core has proposed only one scaling solution (segwit), they should propose some others as well and see if there is support.

@_date: 2015-10-29 19:51:43
I was thinking on more concrete level, eg. business models. You can do a lots of things with blockchains, which create value overall. However creating lock-ins and capturing that value is much more difficult. To date this dynamic has mostly led to these countless shitcoins.
I'm not that sure that just dumping VC money in blockchain startups is a very good strategy. However you never know. And in any case, that is not relevant strategy unless you are billionaire (as bitcoin companies are not public yet, I guess you are meaning the private investments).
@_date: 2017-05-08 11:35:37
I think the most important criterias are: a) enough demand b) the software is stable and widely used enough so that coinbase wants to run it*. Other than that, I don't see why they would not allow trading dash as well as monero. Demand you can see easily from coinmarketcap.
(* for example with ripple I see more risks, since it doesn't have blockchain etc. however it still might be more stable than others.)
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:26:03
Yeah UASF can easily get 99% of nodes, if you just spend shitloads of money on it. However that doesn't matter, only the economically important nodes matter. So the idiots following the node count are just focusing on wrong metric. No major player has favoured UASF.
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:47:35

I have not experienced any forcing from segwit2x's side. If you feel forced, then maybe you should go to seek some kind of help... I don't see how force would be possible in this space. Everyone is choose to run whatever software they want, and it is quite impossible to prevent anyone from doing that.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:54:27
You are delusional. I think you hope so much for segwit to happen that you begin to bend the world around it.
This sounds to me very risky to miners, and it is about low-margin business where every mined block counts. Why would they risk their mining power for some alternative fork not supported by core?
How much mining power do you have? Do you have any idea how the mining business works?
@_date: 2017-05-07 06:34:19
For coinbase it probably makes sense to support any altcoin there is demand for, because that makes them money. I think ideology has little to do with it.

My point wasn't how good or bad western union is. It might suck donkeys' arse. But it is a different service than for example bitcoin debit card. It serves a different purpose.
When I have been traveling around the world, I've seen western union branches in some small villages etc. I have never used that service, and hopefully never will. I myself use mostly credit card etc. I wouldn't go to some unbanked guy telling that he should just use credit card instead of lining up on western union. It doesn't work that way.
Bitcoin might be alternative in some way in some future, but it certainly isn't an direct alternative to western union today.

"Everybody seems to agree that SW and LN pose no threat to Bitcoin whatsoever and can be viewed as extensions to the current system. The same is definitely not true for bigger blocks (main argument against it being a threat to decentralization)."
First, LN is separate from SW, as LN is just a application on top of bitcoin, not really protocol change. Second, wasn't SW supposed to bring bigger blocks as well? It allows storing more data using current blockchain limit, since signature data is separated.

To me it appears a little arrogant... First, most bitcoin users are not developing their own software, so testnet argument is a little weird. Second, "common sense" should automatically apply... It is just other way to say "you're stupid" to the people who have lost their coins.

Well, anyone can fork the bitcoin blockchain and call it "bitcoin classic", and have totally different state for contracts/transactions. That doesn't make the whole system pointless. As long as there is a good enough branding difference and it is easy for users to separate the two chains, I don't see a big problem.

In ethereum it was very clear from beginning which chain/token they are calling "Ethereum". Even those who favour Ethereum classic don't try to mix it up with the other brand, they are happily calling it ETC or Ethereum classic. While with ethereum they fucked up with replay attacks, there isn't any kind of confusion with mixing up ETC and ETH, the brands are clearly separate.


This is unrelated. Ethertards have been promising this and that, I think most of the time their it is just hand-waving bullshit.


I don't see how that statement makes sense. You can believe that ethereum is useful or not, market clearly still thinks it is useful, since the market cap is still above 1 billion. There could be 10 chains but to use it, you just need one functional chain, and you don't need to care about the other chains. Everyone chooses themselves which chain to use (or not to use).
@_date: 2016-07-29 04:44:34
BTC-e was also drained out of ETC, because they didn't prepare properly for the situation: 
There might be other exchanges out there as well with the same problem.
Also this whole shitstorm could have been avoided, if ethereum hard forkers had added some simple backwards-incompatible change to the protocol in the new fork.

Probably for your use case, but it is a different service. Western union allows to transfer physical cash from almost any place in the world to another. For example you can send cash from europe to some small town villager in India, who doesn't have access to internet. That isn't possible with the combination that you describe.

Nobody is saying that. I'm just saying that bitcoin properties are fucking away from cash. Satoshi may have intended it to be cash, but quite often the products that someone intends to be used for something end up actually being used for something else.
Whether bitcoin can scale or not is very relevant whether it should be considered as cash, because cash scales very well with low enough transaction costs. Bitcoin clearly can't do that.
@_date: 2016-07-28 05:33:17
What is your biggest concern with having two chains? Replay attacks are a problem, but they are very easy to mitigate. Other than that, I don't see much problem having couple of chains, or multiple ones, as long as the names are clearly separated. In this cases the market seems to be good at separating the brands for ethereum and ethereum classic (eg. nobody tries to call the other one the other).

This is probably third this kind of "paid advert" article made by bitquick guys/cointelegraph. Adam Draper has probably invested in BitQuick and is hyping it.
Note that on their front page, BitQuick advertises 7000 BTC volume up to date. That is quite a low amount, and is handled by traditional exchange easily in one day. It is easy to not have any problems, when you don't actually have any trading activity.

Well, ECDSA breaking is pretty tinfoil-hatty compared to more common scenarios why people lose bitcoins. I mean, using the same address has its downsides, but so does using different addresses in some situations. For example, bitcoin core still doesn't have deterministic addresses, and you can forget to take regular backups. (I know it is coming in future version)
I don't know what do you mean by "objectively", but I'm pretty sure that for example forgetting to do regular backups is more common than ECDSA breaking.

"The lengthy multi-month delay might sound prohibitively inconvenient, but it isn’t because of instant atomic cross-chain swaps. Investment-banker-types will buy your side-BTC with their main-BTC, at competitive rates. So, in practice, the delay can be avoided by paying a small fee."
This is just plain stupid assumption. To my knowledge investment-banker-types are not interested in collecting some small fees on some niche project. This kind of assumption just proves that the writer doesn't understand much about economics.

They raised the 10 million round for Japan branch. No way would any sane VC send 10 million of good money if they had some problems, because the probability of that helping is very small after they've raised over hundred million and are rumoured holding million of bitcoins in their cold wallet.
Of course it is possible that they scammed the VC's by telling that the money would go for Japan, but actually are using it for liquidity problems, but I very much doubt that. If the ship is leaking, with that userbase the 10 million would last only few minutes (or months) anyway.

Bitcoin has its problems (mainly scalability and stalled progress) but it is still the most well-known brand in cryptocurrency space and also shitloads of services work with it.

The fact that banks are doing fractional reserve is in no way secret. It is also public information and regulators track how much money banks have lent out and how much they have assets. I just guess most are not that interested. I also don't care, I don't store much cash in my bank.

Minor issue IMO. You can split their coins to different addresses. And the point of the fork anyway is that you believe to the majority fork, so you shouldn't care that much that you lose the coins on the other chain.

@_date: 2017-06-29 07:20:56


LOL no. They collect the fees when it makes sense for them - when the work, compliance costs, etc required are less than the fees collected, per transaction. Most people don't even understand the cost structures that are involved with banking (for example compliance costs are widely disregarded in bitcoin space). This is like saying that construction builders build all the projects they can want for whatever payment they get, because they like to build.
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:21:42


Well these are not features, but they affect the situation a lot. Currencies have high network effects. However if the properties such as transfer fees are a lot worse than with the alternatives, I'm pretty sure alternatives will grab the market in the long run. I think it is pretty similar as bitcoin/crypto is taking market from fiat - fiat currency is much more adopted, and very resistant to change, but bitcoin has much better features. However that doesn't mean that bitcoin will gain popularity instantly, but slowly, within years.

What do you mean by "real Ethereum"? Both ethereums have clearly distinct brands and different tickers on exchanges. There is no any kind of agreement what "real" in this context means, I think majority of ethertards think the fork by Vitalik is "real" or "true". I don't care either way.

Maybe 99% of business is unethical if not advertising that a certain food item is unhealthy is considered unethical.

It is quite a difficult decision for a business to stop accepting new customers... It would be probably last resort. And I guess from the new users less than 10% actually need the support. Of course only coinbase knows that number, but based on my experience it is usually very small % of customers who need the support, but those who need it need it a lot and have a lot of issues.
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:28:52

I think both are OK. If you don't like airline overbooking, don't use airlines. If you dislike fractional reserve, don't use banks (all banks are doing it). Or you can select a bank that has the best assets-liabilities ratio, it is public information. Most people don't care.

That is a tautology. The question is, what block size limit would you set at this day? I think it for certainly wouldn't me 1MB, but a bit higher, since normal processing/bandwidth/storage capacity can easily handle more nowadays, and it wouldn't be a problem for anyone, but would allow more transactions. 1MB blocks are too small even for a settlement network.


Miners don't want SegWit but they are probably OK with block size increase - both would work, but block size increase HF would have probably higher change for going through safely.
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:55:08
I don't think satoshi was right at all when he was calling bitcoin as a cash system. when I give cash to my friend, nothing gets recorded to any database, and nothing is processed by any computer. when I send btc to my friend, 5000 computers process and store the transaction, majority store it forever. I think no central bank or banks do that level of data replication.
And in addition I think people should stop treating the white paper as a bible. If something is in the white paper it doesn't mean it makes sense. Not that I disagree with the white paper otherwise, mainly calling it cash doesn't make sense.

Very easy to migitate, for example if old clients say some kind of alert if difficulty gets too low too quickly or something. For bitcoin it wouldn't be a problem at all, because difficulty adjusts each 2 weeks. With ethereum the difficulty adjusts continuously, so it is a bigger problem. But I think bitcoin core has built-in warning if blocks start to appear erratically.
Any way, majority of services have updated their clients, so the scam would show up pretty much instantly...
