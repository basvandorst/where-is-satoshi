Absolute tripe. 
They shouldn't reply to a SINGLE complaint here unless their support queue us empty. 
For years now, they have ignored support requests in the hope people will go away or resolve it themselves (or just give up). Stop giving them a free pass. 
I left them a long time ago. Glad I did. 
If you don't like their support workflow of ignoring customers who don't complain publicly, vote with your feet.

I'd be willing to place a 10 BTC bet with anyone that by this day 2017, not a single withdrawal from BFX, between now and then, will have been successful. 
I love how people are hanging onto hope that their losses will be limited to the "haircut". The level of delusion is really incredible to watch. 
ALL the money is gone and the people behind BFX took it. They are NOT the fake LinkedIn profile people either. 
So no, it wasn't hacked. But they did an amazing job buying enough time to get the hell out and away.

Says the guy who's only been around 2 years. 
You've never had problems with coinbase YET.  Just wait until you need support desperately and they completely shaft you until you scream publicly about it. You'll change your tune. 
I've honestly gotten better support from the worst bank I was ever with. Considering coinbase IS a bank, they're a pretty bad one. Sure you can move money around if you're lucky, but you can do that with a regular bank. 
"What's wrong with bank of America? I've been with them 15 years and never had a problem". What do you say to that statement? Because that's exactly what you sound like. You've been sacked in and brainwashed and you don't even realize it. Of course you'll rationalize and mentally refute that but it's true whether you think it is or not. 
I've left coinbase and my biggest regret is handing over my personal information.  
Keep on singing their praises until you get screwed over. It's only a matter of time.

Par foe the course. Coinbase don't do support. They prowl around social media replying to posts like this so it looks like they're on top of things. Look at their own forums, customers complaining about support ignoring them, they're not replying. 
I'm 11 days now waiting on a reply from support. They've completely lost me as a customer and whoever is in charge of support should be fired. 
Something is going in in there so I took my money out. Gangsters. 
You don't realize how bad a company is until you need help because of a bug in their software. When they don't reply, well, you have been warned. Coinbase are just awful. Look at their reviews (simple Google search), ignore all thoae kicked out because of risk management and you'll see that those that need real support and don't get it are extremely common. There's big problems in Coinbase right now.

You'd be surprised. Ask anyone who works in UX. The majority of the population are so dumb it's scary as hell. 
If Bitcoin is to succeed, it's UI needs to be accessible to 5 year olds. If a 5 year old can't operate it, it's too complicated. 
I've worked at one of the biggest bookmakers/gambling companies in the world. My So works at Google. A shocking amount if budget goes into UX. It's why they're big companies. If you can make gambling accessible to my grandmother, you've made it accessible to the world. 
Right now, Bitcoin is FAR too complicated. It's not even close. If Bitcoin had a usability team, I'd buy back in.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:51:59

I get it, you're posting here to make it look like you're on top of support. How about you jump into the support queue (which, judging by some posts on your community forum is at least a week long) and answer some of those instead of hanging out in reddit all day?
You're fees are high enough to hire a second support staff member. Absolutely infuriating trying to deal with you clowns. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 00:48:10
Similar problem. There's a bug in the Android app that doesn't allow withdrawals from the app. I notified support about it back in September. They thanked me for reporting it and promises it was priority and it would be fixed in the next release. It wasn't. 
Getting pissed off waiting almost 5 months to withdraw MY MONEY I decided to finally go through the Web UI to do it. Trying to log in, I get sent a "verification mail" AFTER entering 2fa credentials. The mail never arrives. Multiple tries, no mail (no not in spam either). They know full well that they're not sending the mail. 
You think I can get any reply from support? Not a chance. Over a week now trying to get a response and not a peep from them. Atrocious customer service. 
Hey Patrick, how about you spend some time answering customers emails instead of shilling on Reddit? Why post your email address if you're not going to reply? 
Anyway, I don't trust them. If they don't care about me as a paying customer, they likely don't care about my money. So I converted it to Bitcoin and transferred it out to my local wallet. 
They made a little over $450 in trading fees from me. Had they just replied to my email, they'd have made a lot more. I bet I'm not the first or the last customer you'll have lost because of your shitty, nonexistent customer service.

@_date: 2017-03-28 16:59:12
I absolutely agree with you. 100%
It's the **not** splitting/forking that I think is holding things back. 
Whatever you think about eth, they at least made a decision and both camps are growing their own separate directions and everyone is happy. 
You're spot on when you say they're endangering the project. Just like you're endangering their project. 
What I believe has happened is that stagnation has painted bitcoin into the remittance corner and if a store of value is it's only use case, it becomes a ponzi. Nobody wants that. 
They should fork and be done with it because bitcoin has already fallen way behind on features and it can't be sustained by network effect indefinitely. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:49:12

Agreed. It's fascinating that they don't get it. This is Bitcoin's biggest problem by a large margin right now and the circle jerk just want to pretend it's not happening. I just don't understand why. 
If you people want your Bitcoin to go to the moon, you should all be focusing on this one problem. Take UX 101 and understand that even coin base is too complicated for the average user right now. 
This is why I got out of Bitcoin. The "community" is destroying it's chances and they're all too cocky to admit it. But they understand how to send bits so nothing else matters.
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:25:35
I was an early adopter. Had thousands of Bitcoin at one point from CPU mining (check my history) and I agree with him. 
I understand the urge to double down but at some point, you realize that there are literally hundreds of better options out there. 
Network effect only lasts so long. 
Bitcoin no longer dies what it was supposed to do well. 
That so many people have moved the goalposts and who see it as a remittance network did Bitcoin a great disservice. 
The community is toxic and alts that you are so quick to demonise do everything bitcoin does and more but better. 
Sure, MySpace is still around. Still desperately switching from niche to niche. Bitcoin will always be around but the people who could have made bitcoin mainstream have all moved on. 
There has been literally no new use case for Bitcoin in half a decade. The use cases it served are dying or useless now. 
Down vote away. Fear of change has killed millions of software projects. Development paralysis and a terrible roadmap have spawned the alts that you use today. 
I'm not trying to convince anyone. I've never used BU. But Bitcoin is not dead, it will just fall slowly further and further behind. It's not fun, exciting, revolutionary or useful any longer and spending a day in an alt community really hits home how toxic the BTC world is.

@_date: 2017-01-14 20:24:31
No, I don't "hodl", nor to I store/keep any. 
As a store of value, are you kidding me? It's 8 years old, extremely risky and extremely volatile. So no. 
It's value lies, outside of speculation, as an anonymous currency. It's not even great at that. The act of buying something anonymously, on the darknet for example, is said to be extremely time consuming containing way too much unnecessary friction. Others can do everything BTC does, faster and better as a digital currency. 
The *only* reason I'd be in BTC now would be for gambling/speculation/day trading and my time is more valuable than that. 
I totally understand the "want" for bitcoin to succeed. I genuinely wish it had. Apart from block interval/confirmation time, technically it's set up well to be a low volume means of transacting. But so is cash. That's not enough to get the rest of the world in. It needs to offer something *better* than money. Right now, you have to sacrifice a convenience to use it as money. Innovative solutions to ANYTHING do the opposite. They make things easier by providing or adding simplicity to the solving of an existing problem. 
I'm also fascinated with the current community in general. The majority are technology savvy. Bitcoin is the *only* internet technology that I'm aware of that technophiles won't switch to a competing but superior product. Considering the difference in discussion between now and pre 2012, now it's clearly *just* speculation here. Nobody cares about solving the problem it was originally intended for, people just want the price to go up. Good luck to them, that's their prerogative. 
So, again, I wish bitcoin had succeeded, but it's window was missed. Vested interests, politics and blind maximalism means eternal stagnation. Additional layers and complexity added by stop gap measures are going to make this worse, not better. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 11:25:27
Why am I not surprised? You know the difference between a regular bank and an investment bank right? 
You really think that the fee for the value added service of insurance is what's making us slaves to the banks? 
I know it's hard to accept but there's a reason people use banks, their debit/credit cards and their "gimmicks" for a reason. Nobody is hiding bitcoin from those people. 
I've been in BTC since CPU mining in 2009 (check my profile) and in 8 years, ZERO has been done to at least match the convenience of modern financial products. ZERO. 
I was a big believer in crypto and bitcoin. Was riding the "change the world" and "banker's are slave drivers" wave just like you. But when you've seen stagnation for 8 years in *A TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY*, at some point your eyes get opened. 
BTC was a great idea. But comparing it's real world utility value to modern financial products is foolish and naive. Besides, there's more advanced technology now. BTC is coasting on it's network effect and speculation. *NOT* utility or feature parity. 
So, I'm not a slave to the banks. I happily pay for a product and service that makes my life easier and takes the hassle out of security. I've tried with bitcoin, I really have. But I'm not willing to live in the dark ages like some hippy because I don't want a business, who provides a valuable service to me, to make money. I don't grow my own food because I hate big farma.

Bitcoiners have given up on the idea of using it as a currency. It won't ever be and can't ever be.

It's good for moving large sums of money around and speculating but as a form of everyday payment, it's not going to happen. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 13:27:33
I already have. I'm not even asking you change your mind. It *will* be changed for you as the euphoria of finding a potentially world changing technology fades away only to reveal another movement that missed the boat and that was destroyed by politics. 
Innovation and creativity happen because of agility and bold decisions. Not by committee and certainly not by ideals and good intentions. 
The only thing I wish I had questioned was my myopia earlier on. Can't complain, made a small fortune from BTC and again from ETH but we simply don't have a cryptocurrency that works. One day we might, but until then, I'll pay the few cents for my insurance (which I've used) and I'll stop dwelling on the past.

It *was* a great technology when it was released. So was VHS. 
It's not anymore. Especially now we know it's limitations. A *great* technology wouldn't be susceptible to eternal stagnation and lack of innovation because of politics. 
It's staggering how brainwashed can be about this. I'll admit, I was brainwashed by it myself. But I eventually saw that it's not the saviour we want, care about or need. The longer people cling onto it, the longer a better system will take to be adopted.

Pretending there's no problem while the entities that make mass adoption possible abandon it is shocking. 
It's like watching VHS manufacturers blaming movie studios for moving to digital formats. Sure, VHS still technically allows movies to be portable but boy does it suck. Just because you own shares in the VHS company doesn't change the fact.

@_date: 2017-01-14 22:00:16
First of all, banks can't decide what you can and can't do. They can enforce government mandated restrictions on moving your money through *their* network. Like how an ISP enforces as best it can the restriction of your child porn or torrent data (for example obviously, not *you're* data) through the network *they* own. You are absolutely free to use another bank network if you don't agree or indeed set up your own bank. Regulations and laws are not "endangerment". They're there to stop places like cryptsy, bitfinex, mtgox in the real world from stealing money. And they do a good enough job. If you don't like the regulations, that's YOUR problem because you're voting to keep them there. 
On your last point, I never said that bitcoin wasn't secure. It is. It's just that that security comes at an unacceptable price of lack of convenience and usability to the average user. It creates an insurmountable friction point above regular mainstream financial products. Politics, vested interests and feature paralysis means that it's not even possible to overcome these limitations. 
The problem that bitcoin solves is a problem nobody (mainstream) cares about, at a price nobody (mainstream) is willing to pay. Exactly like the concord. And we all know how that ended.

I agree with this. I hire software developers. Not a chance in hell I'd hire someone who doesn't know what they're doing. It's not the employers responsibility to give their employees an education, it's the employees responsibility to make themselves valuable enough for someone like me to want them and pay them. 
I see this all the time. Employers owe you nothing. Not trying to be harsh but it seems to me that you need a dose of reality. 
If you want to become a programmer, it has never been easier. Learn online and start your own project. Sell your own software. Even if it's small. If you're like me, you'll find that you like project Managing the process more and that you prefer the selling part. 
In this industry, your github account is your resume. If you can't be bothered filling it up, you'll never get hired. No matter how many sob stories you post on reddit. 
Here's a tip, initially, specialize in a single framework. There's a million polyglots in the world but very few specialists. 
Get yourself a subscription to CBT nuggets, pluralsight or even Lynda. 
If nobody will give you a chance, make your own chances. It still amazes me how so many grown men and women don't realize this yet. 
Good luck.

I just started buying via virwox a few days ago. They screw you over in various commissions throughout the transaction (a Bitcoin withdrawal handling fee? WTF?) but they're not the worst. At the very least, they're trustworthy and in fair essential, they're open about their fees. 
Buying BTC there is a little bit a hoop jumping exercise but I get why they have to do it. Especially for PayPal. 
Another thing that bugs me is that they don't allow you to purchase your Linden dollars in fractions of dollars/euros. So I've got 0.99 usd and eur just sitting in there unused. Not a big deal but still. 
Be aware that there's a 48 hour waiting period for actually withdrawing your BTC once you have it. I totally get this but I've now made three buys and withdrawals and each time I'm still subject to the wait time. Hoping that will go away soon. I'm pretty happy with their service otherwise, despite it being more expensive than other means. 
I think they could do a lot more business by making this a little less painful in fees and a little more frictionless. But otherwise, I can recommend them. Their support is responsive and I can get my BTC for a premium using PayPal. 
Never used AnyCoin, bitstamp and LBC are my other exchanges of choice.

Big fan (thanks for supporting Ether). You might want to make users looking for a pin aware that Tasker can add a pin lock to individual apps pretty easily. It's not super secure (and that may not appease the crypto crowd) but it will stop someone who temporarily has access to your device from sending BTC/ETH. More than enough time to wipe your device remotely if that is ultimately needed and will give you some time to think.

I don't see the problem. Bitcoin gets its power from the blockchain. As blockchain tech goes, it sucks balls. The only reason it's still going is the network effect. Investors can see that the real moon shots are those that learned from Bitcoins mistakes and are rebuilding. 
Bitcoin is one, in retrospect, poorly implemented application of blockchain technology. Just because you're heavily invested in it doesn't make that less true. There are better versions Bitcoin. There are better blockchain. I don't understand the contempt some of this community have for those who've seen the writing in the wall. It's like putting up a goecities page to complain about Wordpress and how you don't need a bloated CMS because you can write HTML just fine in notepad. Or making fun of Gmail because Hotmail worked just fine. 
Remer when all the media distribution professionals changed their resumés from "VHS producer" to "DVD &amp; Digital Media producer". What a bunch of mouth breeders. Didn't they know that watching movies at home on VHS player is changing the world? Especially for those without movie theaters in their town. That better tech will never catch on, especially not with billions of institutional money flowing into it. 
Not saying Bitcoin is dead, it's not. Too many people invested in it. But there are better technologies. Pretending they're inferior and calling people backing them mouth breeders is idiotic and indicative of the circle jerk madness of this place. 
Think what you want if it helps you sleep better but the technology is moving on and leaving Bitcoin behind. I hope Bitcoin finds it's place in the mainstream but as a consumer, I want more.

If you want anyone to take that bet, you'll need to clarify what the vet is a whole lot more. Not sure if you're being intentionally vague but "PayPal will start allowing to fund wallets with Bitcoin in 2016" makes absolutely no sense. 
Wallets can already be funded with Bitcoin. That's what they're for. No need for PayPal. Are you suggesting that PayPal will allow funding of PAYPAL accounts with Bitcoin? If so, they already do, through Braintree indirectly. You want to make a bet, state your terms correctly and explicitly.

Wow. That is exactly what I was looking for. Some really well thought out answers there from both ends of the spectrum. Thanks so much for taking the time guys, I really appreciate it.

Okpay take both. You can then top up your virwox account with Okpay. It's a lot of hoops to jump through. Alternatively, use your skill card to buy BTC anywhere.

Just wit until you run a business and realize that 99.99% of your customers cannot pay you. Instead of going through the hassle and expense of getting bitcoin, they'll just go to a competitor.

Look back 9 years. Reddit posts saying the exact same thing. I was one of them.
Nobody cares. It's never going to happen. Bitcoin found it's niche. It's a perpetual ponzi scheme and it's a super efficient one to boot.
Bitcoin is good for 2 things and 2 things only and that literally hasn't changed in a decade. If you think that's going to change, you're one of the two things.

Can you give me a straight answer on how exactly you're going to revolutionise the world? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 08:23:35
Look up *why* it's popular in Africa. Bitcoin is used is, literally, the world's biggest ponzi scheme there. And the head of the pyramid, a Russian convict who literally holds all the Bitcoin in the scheme... just "died".
This is good for bitcoin.

How exactly is hoarding "fighting for" the technology?

If I sent cash in the mail to another country, it wouldn't be there yet either.
SEPA payments take about 24 hours. Same bank transfers are instant. Takes about 30 hours for me to transfer from EUR-GBP. So not sure what method you chose.
Count yourself lucky, if the merchant days the money didn't show up, you can get your money back.

It seems the entire thread here are missing the *actual* reason why Bitcoin is popular in Africa, especially in Nigeria. The MMM ponzi scheme.
It's astonishing how little people here know about that. Not that the ponzi creator is "dead", let's see how this unfolds. The vast majority of Africans don't have access to their bitcoin. They used bitcoin to buy tokens. All the or bitcoin is, literally, sitting in a "dead" Russian criminal's wallet.

Wow. The irony.
Check my post history. I was mining Bitcoin on my CPU before you knew what the Internet was.
Removing paper currency? Why hasn't it happened yet? 
No more scams? Are you serious? Just look at the very sub you're posting on. Hundreds scammed in the past month alone. 
And the ecosystem? Why has it taken 9 years to develop exactly zero of an ecosystem?
There's no way you believe what you're saying.

I really can't recommend this course enough. It's 12 hours long but I watched it straight, it's that good. 
As I said, get past the first one and it's full of nuggets after that.

This is the same one the ran on a different platform last year. It's absolutely phenomenal. The best MooC I've ever done apart from CS50 from Harvard. 
It's basic enough for everyone and meaty enough that even serious hobbyists will get a lot of value from it. The lecturers did a really good job of planning the course. It's rare to see such decent planning and you can really see the difference between some idiot winging it with a YouTube tutorial and a professional lecturer (there's actually 3 of them). 
If you've any interest in Bitcoin or crypto at all, this is a must watch. If you don't want to wait, the old version from last year is on YouTube. Push past the dryness of the first lecture. It's worth it. 
The friends who should any interest in Bitcoin, this is the resource I send them to first.

That's a complete non sequitur. Read what you wrote again.

Cryptonit.net 
From paypal to btc though, you're looking at close to a 30% hit with them. 
They've got some pretty aggressive KYC too which I get but damn.

Correct. A stock has at least *something* that gives it value.

It's a scam and if you run the exe and you've got a wallet, it's gone. Don't open the exe.

Not true. For many, it's *BECAUSE* they understand it. 
It's SUPER slow, inconvenient, a compliance nightmare and its like that for the general public too so there's no point investing in the hassle to accommodate a miniscule proportion of the market. 
Finally, it's a usability nightmare for all parties. 
*Bitcoin is simply not solving a problem for merchants.* I don't see why Bitcoiners, especially those who proclaim 'education' is the problem, can't understand this. 
Just because you want to believe something is true, doesn't make it so. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 22:46:23
Spot on. But don't let that get in the way of the outrage. God forbid the sheep are prevented from upvoting a blatant lie to the homepage. Because who needs to actually read the article or even do any research?

The trouble is, an "alternate news source" is generally a completely fabricated, uninformed, click bait lie. Case in point, this "article". 
The irony here is just unreal.

There was also MySpace and Bebo. They slowly bled dominance to the better product. 
I bet the AOL clowns who bought those thought the same thing. 
Bitcoin cannot coast on the network effect anymore. If it doesn't innovate or solve its problems, people that actually use it beyond speculation are going to move to an alternative that does. That in my opinion has started to happen. 
**Nobody** stays using a product or service when a better alternative exists because it was the first of its kind. Unless you're the type of person who still uses their compuserve.net email address.

Not in a block it's not. Therefore it's not confirmed at all. If you're getting 2 minute confirmations consistently, you're either on the testnet or another crypto.

That's not how this works at all.
