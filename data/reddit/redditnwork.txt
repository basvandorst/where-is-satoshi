There should be a sticky in this subreddit as well as in the newbie section of BitcoinTalk explaining basic security practices in a clear and concise manner.
Everyone should enable Google Auth on every account.   If you do not have a smart phone there are ways to run it on your computer, but make sure it is being ran from a separate computer or in the very lease within a VM.
I also highly suggest a password management software that creates secure passwords i.e. 64 characters and completely random.  I really love [LastPass]( as it will work on your phone.  There are other open source ones that are not stored in the cloud such as [KeePass] (  You can drop the encrypted keyfile on dropbox and sync it up with your phone.
PS If you are using Google Auth on your phone MAKE A BACKUP!  If you wipe your phone or accidentally uninstall it you will be waiting weeks-months for websites to park your account before they disable Google Auth.

At very high transaction rates each block can be over half a gigabyte in size.
It is not required for most fully validating nodes to store the entire chain. In Satoshi's paper he describes "pruning", a way to delete unnecessary data about transactions that are fully spent. This reduces the amount of data that is needed for a fully validating node to be only the size of the current unspent output size, plus some additional data that is needed to handle re-orgs. As of October 2012 (block 203258) there have been 7,979,231 transactions, however the size of the unspent output set is less than 100MiB, which is small enough to easily fit in RAM for even quite old computers.
Only a small number of archival nodes need to store the full chain going back to the genesis block. These nodes can be used to bootstrap new fully validating nodes from scratch but are otherwise unnecessary.
The primary limiting factor in Bitcoin's performance is disk seeks once the unspent transaction output set stops fitting in memory. It is quite possible that the set will always fit in memory on dedicated server class machines, if hardware advances faster than Bitcoin usage does.
In Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) mode, named after the section of Satoshi's paper that describes it, clients connect to an arbitrary full node and download only the block headers. They verify the chain headers connect together correctly and that the difficulty is high enough. They then request transactions matching particular patterns from the remote node (ie, payments to your addresses), which provides copies of those transactions along with a Merkle branch linking them to the block in which they appeared. This exploits the [Merkle tree]( structure to allow proof of inclusion without needing the full contents of the block.
As a further optimization, block headers that are buried sufficiently deep can be thrown away after some time (eg, you only really need to store say 5000 blocks). 
There are a few proposals for optimizing Bitcoin's scalability. Some of these require an alt-chain / hard fork.
[Ultimate blockchain compression]( - the idea that the blockchain can be compressed to achieve "trust-free lite nodes"
[The Finite Blockchain]( paper that describes splitting the blockchain into three data structures, each better suited for its purpose. The three data structures are a finite blockchain (keep N blocks into the past), an "account tree" which keeps account balance for every address with a non-zero balance, and a "proof chain" which is an (ever growing) slimmed down version of the blockchain

I think to avoid these problems you should let it sit in your coinbase account for ~30 minutes.  You can go to the advanced options and see the inputs - it would be smart to first check those before sending coins.

Honest question for the BitInstant team, what do you guys offer that Coinbase does not?  With their instant purchase ability it just seems pointless for me to use BitInstant.  You guys require user information so your previous ability to remain anonymous is no longer an option.
Fees alone are reason enough to go with CoinBase.

Not my bank.  A few months ago I went into my branch explaining how I did a lot of "cragslist" sales and was asking advice on how to detect counterfit bills.  
They said the pens were worthless, and the best way is to hold the bills at an angle to see color changes.  The bank manager also said it would be smart to do the transaction inside the branch and have a bank teller count/inspect the bills.
With that said, I have yet to do any transactions inside  a bank.  I stick with a well populated grocery store or coffee shop.  Before the trade I like to have a short conversation asking "how long have you been using bitcoins, where did you first hear about bitcoins"  Just having a conversation with someone will give you a feeling if they are shady or not.
No problems yet (knocks on wood).

I know i should technically register as a MSB - but i'm not.  I will collect the information you mentioned and just file it in case I were audited.  I am hoping new laws will come in place realizing that it is rediculous for people to register as a MSB for bitcoin transactions.  Currently they consider all miners as money transmitters - it's asinine.  
So technically this should be collected for anything over 3k?  I was under the impression it was anything over 10k.  Banks report deposits over 10k correct?

Recently it has been ruled that you cannot force someone to hand over a password in court in certain cases.  
[In this case]( a man's laptop was inspected by customs agents and child pornography was discovered. The device was seized and powered-down, at which point disk encryption technology made the evidence unavailable. The judge argued that since the content had already been seen by the customs agents, Boucher's encryption password "adds little or nothing to the sum total of the Government's information about the existence and location of files that may contain incriminating information."
However, in [United States v. Doe]( the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled on 24 February 2012 that forcing the decryption of one's laptop violates the Fifth Amendment
The difference between the two rulings is in previous cases, the courts have held that when the government already knows of the existence of specific incriminating files, compelling a suspect to produce them does not violate the Fifth Amendment's rule against self-incrimination. On the other hand, if the government merely suspects that an encrypted hard drive contains some incriminating documents, but lacks independent evidence for the existence of specific documents, then the owner of the hard drive is entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment.
It would be interesting to know where brain wallets would fit in here.  And what if the bran wallet was "forgotten?"

I use bitcoins in two ways.
1. Savings
2. Spending
Savings is fiat I put into bitcoin and printed to a paper wallet knowing I wont touch it for years.
Spending is fiat I typically convert to btc when either price is low or fiat I convert to BTC moments before a purchase.
@_date: 2013-10-07 20:59:03
Yup that is one of the critical past cases.  As I understand, the deciding factor is if the prosecutors already know what would be found on the encrypted data.  
In the case of a brain wallet - obviously they know that the password would lead to BTC, but how would they prove\know that somebody actually has a brain wallet?

Ironically I was just talking about him in another subreddit:
Ron Paul wrote instruction manuals on how to get away with shooting the black kid who's stealing your car.  He wrote those letters, he signed them, and he charged money for them.  I don't give a shit if he wants to legalize weed (mind you i'm a MMJ card holder).  I'm sorry, if he were elected president and stuck to his ideas (which I agree he is extremely consistent) this country would be an (even more) utter mess.
I just want to mention, there are some things that I really applaud him for ie voting against the patriot act, his stance on internet neutrality, protecting whistle blowers etc - but his numerous, absolutely insane positions are too overwhelming to overlook.
I don't buy that he had no idea, sorry.  His excuse that he was " too busy practicing medicine and giving speeches across the country to pay attention to the bulletins" is bullshit.
One article from October 1992 refers to his hometown, saying, “even in my little town of Lake Jackson, Texas, I’ve urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense, for the animals are coming.” 
Paul offers implausible explanations for why so many derogatory statements made it into his publications, insisting he knew nothing about them. It’s hard to believe that a man who wants to oversee the entire U.S. government — albeit a smaller version — would provide zero oversight of his publications, or even bother to read them from time to time. 
The only thing that has been "confirmed" is his own statement that he had nothing to do with it.  The evidence is too overwhelming - and again, even if it was a ghostwriter he should have noticed it. 
EDIT: In fact, he originally [admitted]( to some of it.










He also made [$1 million]( from the publications - you honestly think he had never checked on what was being written?
