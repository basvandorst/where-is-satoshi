He's butthurt that millions of average joe nobodies are crushing his shitty berkshire gains.

My grandpa cause it pork loins. 
I made that up. He doesn't care

It's "too" not "to." 
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:10:27
No one can tell you for sure. But if I were you I'd hold onto it. It'll bounce back sooner or later. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:40:25
the thought that it may never go back up is what scares people
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:39:21
umm what? I'm a holder but what's the big deal with buyers/sellers? They're not "doing" anything but neither is anyone who makes money from any investment, right?
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:56:17
I'm in the fetal position right now.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:02:07
This isn't true- by that logic why spend a dollar now when you can use it to buy BTC? You don't literally just spend all your money on crypto now. 
 People will always spend money on stuff. There are always incentives to save but people always spend and spend and spend.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:16:09
haha I know this pain all too well. I was off by a few cents during the China fud.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:09:59
Well consider it a donation that makes all other coins more rare.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:04:05
Other countries with wildly volatile currencies peg things like groceries and salaries to the US Dollar. It's not a big deal to have to do that. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:18:13
i was wondering where this was from- you're doing the lord's work. Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:59:03
There's an argument that it could become a useful deflationary  currency in that its price doesn't drop by a lot but it does go up.  The drops are really the only thing merchants care about in terms of accepting it as payment- and even if it goes up in value people are always gonna spend. People spend money now when they could use it to invest in all sorts of things to grow it 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:29:36
Welcome to the fucking show.
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:05:27
It's deflationary if it's being used it's price will always go up. There's a fixed amount
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:53:54
Hmmmm actually thinking about moving my coins to coinbase for the fork now....
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:12:23
That's true. The past is gone. The future doesn't exist. And the only way we can try to impact a better future is the actions we take in the present. BTC ZEN buy in the now. Hodl in the now. Be one with the blockchain. Get Lambozzz
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:10:09
Shit... I always thought if I held long enough I could never "cash out" and just spend my btc like I would any other money I had and not worry about taxes. I'm dumb
@_date: 2017-09-07 01:25:24
Is it bad that there are machines to buy bitcoin all over now but you still can't pay for stuff with it most places?
@_date: 2017-09-13 05:18:36
I knew it existed back in the day--- but I didn't need to buy drugs online and that's all I ever thought it was used for back then.
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:42:56
postdictive sounds better. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:19:17
ha you're lucky it's only 200~
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:04:39
They can't kill the blockchain but couldn't they regulate it to death? If they make it impossible for merchants to accept it or to convert it to USD (or whatever other govt currency) wouldn't that kill it?
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:13:03
how can you get away with not having a grasp on "tech" these days though? Tech is a part of every single sector now. It's changing every industry
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:03:11
Digital currency is 100% going to be the future. Who knows if it's gonna be bitcoin though, right?
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:39:33
this is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:23:52
My point is that all industries are effected by tech. The trucking industry is gonna change in HUGE ways due to self driving cars in the near-ish future.  
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:42:00
Economics is zenned out
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:46:59
You can say that about anyone who owns any type of investment. Most don't know what they own.

To be fair... you can say it's a bubble if a majority of people throwing money at it don't understand what it is either... (not saying this is the case though)
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:59:45
Every second of every day someone is predicting a stock market crash. There will always be people who were "right" when it happens. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:15:35
haha true. By that logic every cent he's ever earned is "easy." It's not like Warren is out there digging ditches to earn a living. WTF? Sounds like he's just a little salty that people who never invested in the actual stock market are making unheard of gains
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:30:41
its very easy to move coins off an exchange wallet to an anonymous wallet but the problem is if you ever want to cash out. For bitcoin to "win" we need to live in a world where we never have to cash out. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:20:40
If you had cash in you house it would get destroyed in a flood. But I guess people don't really store large amount of cash in houses these days....

I've definitely bought 6 dollar+ hot dogs at sporting events.

My stop loss is probably gonna get triggered soon. I'm okay though
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:18:59
but isn't it ultimately all tied together anyway? You can't buy bitcoin without regular old inflation-prone fiat money. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:17:29
If you don't hold enough to warrant buying a hardware wallet than you don't really hold enough to even bother checking price charts or caring about forks.
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:07:56
love when places give btc discounts. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:46:07
That means you have to keep your coins on gdax though- which is risky itself.
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:55:29
Seriously one of the big benefits of BTC is a flood can't destroy your money. It's in the "cloud."  You can carry around millions of dollars in your brain by memorizing 12 words.
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:17:32
spending is good for the economy though, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:22:26
I think there is definitely a "point of no return" where if it picks up enough market cap and is accepted by the walmarts and amazon of the world than there is no stopping it... but we're not there yet. 
and until it gets there it could be stopped by regulations
@_date: 2017-09-07 23:24:06
buy ltc
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:40:24
Haha I just loaded up my trezor for the first time (after months of having btc sitting in exchanges) and I felt like that every time a transaction went through. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:09:38
a lot.
@_date: 2017-09-24 05:57:16
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:04:08
Hahah I sold at 3000 but bought in again at 3900
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:53:28
And I'm sure horse salesman? said the same thing about cars :)
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:43:18
whoa. Nice boobz
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:12:44
It's true. Cause unless you have a bunch- even if BTC hits 10k it won't be life changing for you
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:54:08
I actually like my master card for rewards points but BTC is making me bank right now.
