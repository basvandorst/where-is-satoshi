Then how can I sweep all my funds in the absence of blockchain.info ? To be more specific, how can I get all those privare keys by using same 12 word  recovery phrase?
@_date: 2016-09-29 16:00:47
Since last 1 year, I was looking for this answer. Still trying to finish remaining 30000 bitcoins.

U can generate paper wallet offline, encrypt it with BIP38 and save paper wallet at safe location.
@_date: 2016-09-29 15:46:59
Sorry dear, u became a victim of Double Spend. Wait at least for 3 confirmations before finalizing any transaction. 0 confirmation is not valid bitcoin transaction to trust it. 
After 3 confirmations, complete further steps. 
Bdw, how many BTCs there were in transaction?
@_date: 2016-10-17 16:21:14
Bdw, i dont know what is sock puppet... 
@_date: 2016-10-23 05:36:58
So sorry... 
@_date: 2016-10-17 16:19:51
As per my calculations, less than 1.
@_date: 2016-10-16 13:26:56
..and also, they have more coins than me. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:44:24
Keep it up dear. Dont pay attention to craps. Keep node running
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:21:34
I got approved my key in just 20 hours.. ��
@_date: 2016-10-15 05:55:52
Thats what I am thinking. 
Probably, attacker may be hater of free things... ha ha.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:34:56
:(  I can understand his pain..

@_date: 2017-05-31 05:17:12
Just wait for the final verdict on legalizing bitcoin in India. 
Fingers crossed...!!
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:52:16
Then lets fcuk him. Lets support segwit. 
 
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:12:29
But I didn't have any problems with bc. 
And as I have word seed of my wallet, I have full control over my btc. I think so. 
Just, do they support bip148 or not, matters. Am I correct?
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:59:58
I think, it will work. Expert's guidance needed.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:13:03
U can run only node, only mining application or both on single pc. It depends how u configures it what u installs. 
However, running a node is very easy task. 
1. Arrange for a ok-ok configuration pc. 1tb disk and 2gb ram recommended. 
2. Use unmetered broadband internet connection. 
3. Install bitcoin core from trusted only source and follow bundled instructions. 
4. Assure 24×7 uptime of system.
U r a owner of an ideal full Bitcoin node. 
If u want and if u have static ip address, u can advertise ur node address to more and more bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 19:16:06
It seems that you have WIF private key. Convert this to public bitcoin address using 'bitaddress offline package' and check its balance on blockchain
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:43:33
Ok. Thanks. This clears my doubt. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:02:14
Just take his share from him by paying the money. 
Hodl on yourself.
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:24:45
As I have some BTCs in my Blockchain wallet, is it necessary to transfer all BTC's to another SegWit supporting node attached wallet? 
Kinda noob here..
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:05:10
Thats nice option. I also have 6969.69 btc on Blockchain. Should I transfer them to u?? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:55:39
That's the obvious question. 
But, when bitcoin was at initial state, miners were concentrated in China only. At that time, mining was a profitable business. So, more and more miners increased in China itself. 
As time passed, bitcoin spread its popularity. But, at this time, mining lost its profitability. So, buying new equipments remain no more economic to run. So, as bitcoin came towards western countries, only nodes increased to support bitcoin but no any significant size of miners. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:29:46
Nano-s only works as a 'key' to to the wallet addresses generated by ur nano itself. So, once u copies ur address, u can keep nano unplugged. This will cause no effect on receiving btc. 
However, to spend bitcoins, u need to connect nano to pc, for momentary instance, though... 
However, using different addresses at every new transaction is necessary to keep all ur transactions unlinked with each other.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:10:23
But, if we all nodes opt out for SegWit then what will happen to Bitmain's miners??? 
They also have to go for SegWit. If not, their mining chips will become unuseful, right? The miner networks may feel outage for some time though..!! (I thinks so) But after that, they must have to go with SegWit...(my theory, citation needed)
If yes, then why can't we force them to accept segwit? 
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:43:20
So kind of you... thanks
I am trying to withdraw dogecoins from block.io via API as cURL over http request. 
It is bit possible in PHP or JS. But I want to do it just over http calls directly without triggering any JS or php script. 
That is, all should be in only one string, parsable as a standalone URL so that I have to only type it on browser address bar and thats it. Coins transferred.
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:18:38
Chances are 50/50
1. Check ur email inbox for any old signup or notification email from wallet service.
2. Check the transaction log of ur address and look at the ip details of the transaction node. 
This may help. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 02:23:45
No, I am sacrificing my extra 0.004BTC towards miner to regain my accidentally sent 5.55BTC. 
Btw, as you says; but its very hard to find a particular person behind a miner which mined the transaction. 
And, why should he give it back??!!!
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:39:31
Then, how much btc still u hodl?
@_date: 2017-07-09 02:18:45
Ohh, that gives sense. 
Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:37:12
Cant I just go for cURL over http ? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:40:50
Do u have its private key?? I wonder, u dont..
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:17:17
☺ Thanks for help buddy. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:52:01
Wow.. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:09:47
Cmon man, a history older than 8 years?? Who could keep such old history?? 
Try something different..
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:04:22
and what is that?
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:43:47
Use them just to buy coins. Dont store in them. Use Mycelium or Copay or paper wallet for storing. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:27:38
Yes, you can. 
That why the passphrases are for. 
But, dont use same passphrase on new hardware wallet. Just recover lost wallets bitcoins by using old passphrase. Transfer those all btc to new paper wallet. Keep new wallet ready and sweep the paper wallet to newly ready hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:24:27
I locked my 78k dogecoins and I forgot transaction pin. Count them also.. :(
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:00:04
Just DM me the screenshot of paper wallet. I will transfer ur bitcoins to ur exchange account. :p 
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:51:11
You are awesome bro... keep it up.
