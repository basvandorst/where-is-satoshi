In other words, you claim the problem is unsolvable and I have given you 2 actual solutions to the problem. If you disagree, please enlighten us as to why Vitalik Buterin is wrong on this issue and you are right.

Such an attack is absolutely sustainable with greater than 50% of the hashing power. It can literally stop all transactions. Also, not a simple task to stop the propagation of valid blocks. As your percentage of the hashing power increases you can roll back past transactions as well. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 00:54:13
The argument goes like this: even if a small percentage of users are on a non-reference client, the rational minter would use the non-reference client to gain that tiny advantage. It may be more of a theoretical vulnerability than a practical one. Nonetheless, it is an issue. The history revision attack is a byproduct of this that far more dangerous. Only centralized checkpointing addresses this in Peercoin. NXT and Bitshares are developing real solutions to this, while Peercoin buries its head in the sand.

No centralized checkpointing in Nxt

Just because you don't understand something, or are too lazy to research it, doesn't make it obfuscated ([Nxt transparent forging]( See my posts above for my reply to the traditional criticism of PoS.

This [thread]( describes the details of the selection algorithm (I think there is a difference between Ripple-style "consensus algorithms" and deterministic selection). Also, I should add that just because you haven't spent the time to critically review something, doesn't make it "unproven empty hype". With deterministic selection, "nothing at stake" is solved by penalizing miners who do not participate on the main chain. In a way, you can think of it as a form of "punitive PoS", with the objective being similar to Vitalik's Slasher algorithm (though the actual solution is far more elegant). 
Here are the details (from the link): **The network can detect which miners don't take part in block generation and act accordingly.** [...] Imagine someone is going to do a "51%" attack against Nxt and he owns 90% of all coins. The adversary must stop generating blocks for legit branch coz he won't be able to compete against 100% mining power with his 90%. So he decides to "skip" his turn to generate a block. The rest 10% of the network detects this and penalizes the adversary by setting his mining power to 0 and distributing it among other miners. Now the network is back to 100% power coz everyone got 10-fold increase. The adversary can mine other branch in a secret place but it won't be able to replace the legit branch. Of course, the 2nd branch will have 100% "hashing" power tied to it as well, coz the attacker will get his 90% bumped to 100% but this can be counteracted by some mechanisms of advanced consensus (still not revealed).
Edit: Sorry, posted my comment too soon. The remaining problem requiring "mechanisms of advanced consensus" actually only applies when attempting to prevent the +51% attacker from replacing the main chain. This actually goes beyond the security guarantee of both traditional PoW and PoS algorithms and is not relevant to the discussion at hand since it is, in theory, implied that the 51% majority stakeholder **should** be able to control the main chain.
Edit 2: clarity

Simple. You purchase private keys to a wallet that owned a large amount of stake at some point in the past. This is quite easy since the prior owner can sell their coins and sell you keys to the empty wallet for a low price. Accumulate a significant amount of "past stake" in this manner (little to no cost). Rewrite the entire blockchain from a point in time when those past coins were present until the current time. There is no "work" required to do this and therefore it is essentially free. Get it? Only Nxt and Bitshares are addressing this vulnerability in POS (though neither is completely implemented yet). Peercoin's solution is checkpointing and nothing else.

You guys have missed the point entirely. Not all actors are motivated by short term monetary gain,  ie, governments wanting to maintain control of their currency, bankers wanting to maintain their monopoly, etc.

When the block reward disappears people will realize that mining is an unscalable and expensive proposition that leads to high fees and centralization. Bitcoiners hate to hear it, but proof of stake is the future of digital currency. Gavin's Segway analogy may be true about Turing-completeness, but doesn't apply to mission-critical attributes like security and scalability. Competitors like NXT transparent forging and Bitshares DPOS can provide better security than Proof of Work at up to 1000TPS for a fraction of the cost. As the current double digit inflation rate of Bitcoin begins to taper, the true cost of PoW security will be known.

Trust for bootstrapping a new node is actually not contrary to decentralization. It is true for the same reason you know and trust Walmart or CNN. With NXT, trust is only required for bootstrapping. This is a tiny minority of nodes anyway, and the alternative is absolute trust in GHash.IO. Really a non-issue that the mining brigade likes to harp about.
@_date: 2014-05-17 13:21:51
Ha! You are deeply misinformed my friend. "Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible." Guess what? There is not just one solution to "nothing at stake", there are many: TaPOS (part of Bitshares DPoS) and Slasher both solve the "nothing at stake" problem. [TaPOS]( [Slasher]( Unless you disagree with Vitalik Buterin and know something all the rest of us don't. Even in Peercoin it is not a practical vulnerability since you do not have a strong incentive to use a known malicious alternate client (against your own interest) to mine all chains. This is because your coin-days still accumulate even if you have an infinitesimally lower chance of mining the next block by using the standard client.

The reason why Nxt deterministic selection solves problem  is nuanced, but described in detail [here]( Problem  is solved by Nxt leased forging. Leased forging allows you to lease your stake to other accounts (typically in exchange for a fraction of rewards earned). This way even small balances can easily be used to secure the network by "voting" with your stake (letting others "mine" with your stake).
@_date: 2014-05-17 04:37:23
Peercoin, though practically secure, suffers from two theoretical vulnerabilities: (1) the "nothing at stake" problem, which would only be an issue if a significant number of stakeholders began to use a known malicious non-standard client that mints on multiple chains with no benefit to the user, and (2) low minting participation. Nxt transparent forging solves issue  with a fully deterministic selection algorithm and Nxt leased forging solves issue  Bitshares DPoS solves issue  similarly and uses stake delegation to solve issue  Although new attack vectors will no doubt be discovered, the traditional arguments against proof of stake are no longer relevant at this point.

Well if you don't understand how minting works I can't help you. Any person can mint their own chain. The number of coin days destroyed determines the weight of the chain. You can rapidly mint a chain of any length if you are the only one accepting blocks since there is no "work" involved. Using spent addresses gives your chain weight and costs you next to nothing. This is a simple concept really, and if you don't have the capacity to understand it then I think you should be reading more and writing less nonsense.

Tragedy of the commons. Same reason why people join GHash.IO even though it hurts Bitcoin.

Hey genius, POS has no mining. Therefore, there is no pre, post, or present mining, period. The coins were distributed in a 2 month open IPO. Not ideal, but neither is POW distribution with giant mining farms gobbling up 90% of the coins.
@_date: 2014-06-14 05:58:40
The checkpoint is issued by a consensus among the active forgers. It is not centralized and only requires trust for bootstrapping a new node (a relatively infrequent event).
@_date: 2014-05-17 13:10:55
Ok, you agree that TaPOS (part of DPoS) and Slasher both solve the "nothing at stake" problem? [TaPOS]( [Slasher]( The point I was making is that the problem has been solved in many of the emerging POS algorithms (not just one) and that even in Peercoin it is not a practical vulnerability since you do not have a strong incentive to use a known malicious alternate client to mine all chains (your coin-days still accumulate even if you have an infinitesimally lower chance of mining the next block).
@_date: 2014-06-14 05:07:27
Multiple stake detection exists only in the reference client. A rational minter would use an alternate client to mint on all chains (improving their chances of minting on the right chain), thus leading to "nothing at stake".
@_date: 2014-05-17 23:57:53
Ok, I changed my mind. You sound like a reasonable guy so I will explain further. The PoW aspect of Slasher is only there to provide a decentralized timestamping service and is not a security mechanism (plays no part is selecting the right chain). POS decentralized timestamping is already in the works for Nxt transparent forging and is a big part of their proposed solution to "nothing at stake". Even if the PoW aspect of Slasher was unchanged, it would only require 1% of the mining resources of Bitcoin (and not for security). An even simpler solution is Daniel Larimer's TaPOS algorithm. In TaPOS, the size of the stake is the number of coin-days destroyed in a transaction. Miners who mine on more than one fork are detected simply by checking whether the same inputs are spent on other chains, and not counting their votes if they are. As you can see there are very real solutions to this very marginal issue. This is why the majority of development on core mining protocols is in proof of stake. In fact, I will speculate and say that many of the Bitcoin developers are pseudonymously developing these projects. I have circumstantial evidence to support this (of course no proof).

Deterministic in the short term (ie, a few blocks in the future). Your comment about nodes crashing due to transaction load shows that you have no idea what you are talking about (sorry).

False. I'll repaste my reply above: Peercoin, though practically secure, suffers from two theoretical vulnerabilities: (1) the "nothing at stake" problem, which would only be an issue if a significant number of stakeholders began to use a known malicious non-standard client that mints on multiple chains with no benefit to the user, and (2) low minting participation.

Not to mention the "history revision attack", which is even more dangerous IMO. NXT and Bitshares (nearly identical POS algorithms) are the future of crypto because they use trust/consensus protocol for bootstrapping nodes. Peercoin is lightyears behind.

Sorry, but this is completely untrue. Nxt has been open source since March 1st. [See here.]( It was originally planned to release the source on April 3rd, but development progressed faster than expected and the code was released early. The primary reason why Nxt source was witheld for a short period is that Nxt is the ONLY cryptocurrency that is not a fork of Bitcoin, and therefore the security implications are/were greater than usual.
