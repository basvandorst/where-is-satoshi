Know that when a person is toxic, it is because of their own issues. Accept that a toxic person's behavior has nothing to do with you. In life, each of us has to take responsibility for our own actions. Toxic people do not do this. They have a habit of turning things around so that you feel bad, you feel guilty, and you feel like you are at fault. Realize this and take back your power.

As best I can tell, a coin called HDAC switched from Lyra2REv2 to Skunk for their algorithm to combat ASICs and it tanked the coin's network hashrate and difficulty. It has adjusted now and that ship has sailed.
