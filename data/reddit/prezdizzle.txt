1. which of these is going to be best for astronomy? 
2. if we take one of these stargazing, do we all have to wear protective eyegear while looking at the stars (??) that seems kind of silly...just curious when these all say "Requires Protective Glasses: YES" if that's a CYA type thing on your site, or if you really do need glasses?

Here's the link to the thread on -- seems like a really cool idea. I was stoked to see he accepted BTC tips

Don't let a few bad apples ruin the bunch.
Just because some people are pushy, doesn't mean you should write dogecoin off altogether. The dogecoin community is as vibrant and charitable, if not moreso, than the bitcoin community. And a whole lot less srs. 
I subscribe to both and don't see why there should be animosity between the two. Be at peace with all men!

I really don't think it will happen...but it did make me realize, dang, having Bitcoin in a situation where government is threatening stuff like that would be nice
@_date: 2014-06-13 07:54:18
this is very bad. i just cashed out a significant stake and will not be bringing that money back in until I see them ~40% or less.

Just wanted to say that this is a great idea and what I've been planning to do since I got into BTC. A lot of these comments are negative, just wanted to say I agree and glad someone else is thinking along these lines. This is a powerful vehicle for contributing to worthy causes.
I would love if we had a wiki of charities that accepted bitcoin. I may make one when I'm ready to donate if one isn't already made.

Positive but not overly informative. Felt like a puff/hype piece by a believer, rather than an objective analysis of if/how Bitcoin and other cryptos could play a part in the younger generation's financial strategy.

Do Bitpay or Coinbase offer any safeguards that would prevent someone at the non-profit from *buying* on their exchange? i.e. can we have a "receiving-only" account type? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:45:56
We've had people ask to give it, as in the US you can get a large tax deduction and avoid capital gains tax by giving your appreciated Bitcoin to a non-profit, rather than them selling it for cash and then donating. Most charities do the same by accepting stock shares or real estate--it's just a bit of a newer thing to accept an asset like cryptocurrency. We're trying to be ahead of the game and be one of the earlier accepters of it.

This part:


"But, but," the billionaire sputters. "You have to. You owe me..."
"No," the man with the bitcoin responds. "No we don't. We don't owe you anything."
Your grand idea to topple the billionaire is not something that Bitcoin solves. Bitcoin actually could suffer from the exact same issue X years from now if it were ever widely adopted.
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:59:35
You do realize Bitcoin would face this same problem, right?

"A delay is better than disaster"
Seriously, one of the biggest Bitcoin events in Coinbase's history and you're worried about a 12-hour delay? When you knew this day was coming months ago? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:10:01
considering there aren't hundreds of millions of coins in existence, probably not the latter
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:33:50
Lolwut. I've been defending Coinbase but this is BS. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 22:26:53
Settle down, yo. If Coinbase wasn't solvent they wouldn't have sent multiple emails encouraging people to move their coins out of Coinbase. They are very careful and keep most of their coins in cold storage to prevent loss of coins. They're probably burning through their online hot wallet and having to bring cold storage coins online, which takes time. 
Nothing Coinbase has done during this entire period suggests insolvency or being a "fractional reserve." If anything, their actions suggest just the opposite.

Dave has been around since the early days of Bitcoin. Seems like I've seen several posts like this over the last few years. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:26:18
Initial coin investment $320,000 USD  Initial trade funds $100,000
Selling coin value $10,000,000 Return on trade funds after fees $76,000
Total Profit $9,658,000 in just over a month and a half.
1. 10,000 coins at $320 is $3.2M, not $320k
2. Even if you go with the bigger number of $3.2M, that may not be enough to move the market (current market cap: $7.6B)
3. But let's be generous and say you could move the market, since many of the coins that make up that $7.6B market cap aren't being actively traded. Eventually someone will notice what you're doing. That's the beauty of every transaction being public. 
Pump and dumps can be a good short term play, especially with the relatively small market cap and where regulation is lacking (hello, Bitcoin!), but this problem, in addition to the reasons listed above, will lessen over time as a) adoption increases and it begins to take more capital to move the market and b) regulation happens.
In the absence of a bigger market cap or regulation, the market should adjust, if buyers/sellers act logically, knowing that big market movements could be the product of market manipulation. 
In short, is your scenario plausible? Certainly, especially now while we're in a bit of a Wild West phase. With that said, the Wild West will eventually be outgrown and/or regulated, most likely, and if it's not, the market will adjust in response. 
Edit: final thought--even in pump and dumps, usually your goal is to move the market +/- 10-20% in your favor, over the short period of time. Unless you have a very high % of shares, there's no way you can move the entire market move 100s of % points over an extended period of time by yourself.

Hmm. I really like the Reddit tipping the way it is, but this might be a way to allow tipping across multiple sites. 
@_date: 2013-10-01 11:49:59
would this work? 
essentially the way bitcoin works is transactions are "confirmed" by a bunch of sources.
if you controlled a ton of fake computers, could you get them all to send out the same bogus confirmations and mess things up?

Nice! Our family's entire Thanksgiving dinner ended up being a Q&amp;A with me answering ~10-12 people's questions about Bitcoin, after someone brought up that they had seen on the news that they were up to $1,000/coin and wondered if anyone had any. 
My wife's aunt was the most interested, as she is a tax consultant whose role I believe is to help big corporations like Apple with reducing the amount of taxes they pay to the U.S. government, so she was interested in how Bitcoin would be regulated to ensure people and corporations couldn't illegally launder money. 
Other than her, I honestly don't think anyone "got" why we need Bitcoins. Most at the table were older and not super tech savvy, so that may have contributed. Regardless, it reminded me we have a ways to go before mainstream adoption happens.

On Brainwallet JSON page, what to do with all the inputs on the page? I copied + pasted the JSON and just left the default inputs alone.
It said "Warning! Source address does not match private key."
It asked if I wanted to push to  and when I hit OK, it gave an error that it could not find all TX inputs.

^^this. Ease yourself in to the position. 
One thing I definitely recommend doing is getting set up with whatever method of buying you want to do (unless you're buying local with cash). Most places take a few days to confirm your bank account, etc. If you're waiting for the "opportune moment" to buy, you'll want to be ready to act. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:12:13
can someone give a long answer?
is it just because their fear of government confiscation of Coinbase? b/c honestly I would assume Coinbase has better security than I would have storing them in my own computer/safe/whatever.
