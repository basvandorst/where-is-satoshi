Imagine you want to buy an orange. 
Choice 1: go to a friendly supermarket and buy orange. Price includes store overhead, wages, and third parties. Orange is 1.20
Choice 2: go find a farmers friend and ask him to ask his friends for an orange. He gets a little bit off the top from selling the orange to you. Orange is 1.10
Choice 3: yell at a farmers market that you will only buy orange at 1.05. Farmers can ignore you or someone will sell it to you. 
Choice 1 is coinbase. Choice 2 is market order at GDAX. Choice 3 is limit order at GDAX. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:59:04
Coinbase and GDAX are same parent, coinbase login is same as GDAX logon.

Cool fucking quote from KGB superstar, I'm sure Russia would love to switch to a Bitcoin standard /s
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:12:10
Transfer funds to GDAX if you know how to use an exchange and limit orders, no fees. Transfer anywhere with ethereum. 
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:02:54
Lots of people buy houses and stocks and hold them for generations. This isn't a currency, it's a "store of value", no one uses Bitcoin anyways.
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:56:19
So is coinmarketcap and coingecko and biz, seems coordinated
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:22:23
Hahaha this is actually good for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:00:31
Note READ THIS. Comedy gold. Or Comedy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:55:37
Yes because saving lives is making money /s
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:02:10
You got me. I put in too much and got scared. Sold 33% of holds at 22% profits. It’s ok for me. It was too much to it in a month ago. Thousand things I could have done better. But eh. I’ll beat myself up later when I’m at moon. To it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:08:11
Everyone! I have an important announcement to make! I just got my brand new Butterfly Labs ASCI miner!! In only two weeks!
What did I miss?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:02:05
Bitcoiners praise the good news of a man who best described himself as similar to a heroin dealer. I’m noticing a trend...
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:14:26
Hey man you doing okay? It seems like you got hit with a hurricane back a bit. Want to help out if I can. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:52:21
That’s a bummer, post a public address of your bitcoin and I can try and send a little later. Or just DM it to me, honestly this stuff is a little confusing. Or an ethereum or bcash wallet addresses for a little less fee your way. Or PayPal, honestly whatever helps i couldn’t care less. Whatever is safest for you. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:03:05
Because it is. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:01:41
Because no one buys Bitcoin. Do you see?
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:02:48
This is it. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 05:00:07
8 hours a day, 6 days a week. Sign me up.

He's my favorite the best is his insistence that 100 Grand is enough to live in a gated citadel
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:07:28
10k hype!!!
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:22:34
This is speculation, sorry.
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:16:36
For future sake, please be sure to take at least 10-15% of your trades out for cash if you want to do trading on something you may lose money on. You can set up a payment plan of sorts with the IRS, I don't have the link on top of it.
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:24:11
Is this like Xenosaga? I loved that game! Also come on, what the fuck is this shit.
@_date: 2018-03-24 04:58:38
Lambo. Fuck tech. No jk
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:49:23
Do it every other week. Nurture an addiction.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:34:50
Remember kids there isn't enough litecoin out there for everyone to hold four. Remember kids, there is only x amount of bitcoin cash out there. What else? There's no reason bitcoin being limited is going to work because it's a voluntary system. People will ignore it.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:36:19
Propaganda must be spread on the regular. haha, i'm just playing bitcoin, you know I love you.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:45:20
The trend is your friend in speculation.
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:18:05
MAY 10K, seems like a great motto for this place. I would chant it.
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:07:56
It will go back to 19k without weak hands, to the moon!n!
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:49:46
Ok cool. I'm glad your work paid off. It may be tough to recommend what you did to others though. You have to have a little luck sometimes. Have a good one, mate. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:37:45
The energy use is the biggest feeling as to why I feel gross owning my fifth of a coin, just me though.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:42:13
About as scarce as 1400 currencies. I'm an environmental sciences major.
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:19:27
Boo hoo hoo. K
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:04:18
Congrats to cheering that the price is down only 22% since last week
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:11:42
An interest free loan supported by a business you put work in, day in day out, is not the same as baseless speculation. Are you comparing this to people taking 7% loans to gamble their futures and security away?
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:43:11
It rhymes with 10k. :)
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:29:28
This is the best story out of bitcoin by far. The rise, fall, and resolute victory of a cryptocurrency exchange.
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:46:13
Well that's cute.
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:18:14
You all remember that theymos post stickied when Bitcoin was first at 9k? I would take care to heed those words. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:11:57
I would love to buy 5k bitcoins in five days
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:55:02
It's your age minus 10 for bonds. But there's a bull market for both hitting trouble so right now your money is safe in commodities and speculation, I think. I'm hedging against still. Can't ever be perfect
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:25:09
Dark side is 45 today, but this is a favorite of mine regardless. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:52:35
Yeah me too. If I full throated my ether and Bitcoin position early on, fuck. Ah well. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:10:21
Don't worry they can ratchet the difficulty down so it'll cost 1000 when the price is 1200. It's the magic of this market. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 02:09:13
This subreddit is more moderated than the Donald. Think about that.
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:57:36
70% drop? Yes please
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:47:53
Cool story bro. Hope you're staying in Malta or Singapore. Stay out of Puerto Rico
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:59:20
He also sold them all and got them stolen..  you are all delusional

They should have just done trezors on Nokia phones. Save money on costs
