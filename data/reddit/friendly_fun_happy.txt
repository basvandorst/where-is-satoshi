How can I get free electricity? Can I build my own power plant in the river next door?
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:52:13
Yea I'm not storing my bitcoin where I can get assaulted irl and or lose them to a fire or natural disaster. I will let an exchange keep them.
I would never keep $10000 under my bed, that's just asking for trouble.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:39:46
I mean can't you do all of that with bitcoin but just use 3rd party software.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:22:21
how about you don't hide criminals for money
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:36:06
Genuinely made me laugh again thanks :P

I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE BITCONNECTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:21:22
yea but people gotta be willing to sell it for that
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:17:15
what are non revocable payment mediums?
pretty sure coinbase takes bank transfers/credit cards and you can cahrgeback those?
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:11:43
It's just so frustrating seeing so many alts, I really can't decide which one to use, and much less which one to incorporate to my business. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:54:19
yea no thanks I'm keeping my money under my bed.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:16:13
how wuld you know they arent counterfit

your mom is
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:45:36
exchanges are way safer than anything I could keep my bitcoins in.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:39:38
Can you tell me the winning lottery numbers too please young wise one.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:25:09
man I don't have time for that, like just the amount of info I've had to read on bitcoin now imagine reading on alt coins and the history, etc etc discerning what are lies and truths. Like that requires some serious effort.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:52:46
300 a month living with your parents I imagine.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:57:23
How can I know which ones are pump and dump though?
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:16:41
Yep but you gotta add up to how much scammers put into the scam. So what you said + scammers a lot of effort = people get fucked
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:07:20
where can I find the real one tho
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:16:01
what if they fuck you up in person via a gun and or they give you fake money
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:17:47
problem is you can get mugged and or counterfit
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:16:51
wher can I find your post
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:54:11
Just last night I lost $600 gambling, I guess that's 2 months for you?
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:29:07
Yea but I'll come crying when something goes wrong because I messed up and or lost and or got stolen my private keys.
Guess what I'll trust a multi million company literally dedicated to this to keep my funds safe. Like get the fuck out of here.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:17:35
aren't there fees on that
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:54:13
don't have the time to read or learn anything about cryptos, I use exchanges they are simple, fast and safe. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:25:52
well don't all altcoins serve the exact same purpose as bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-27 08:45:13
nah that's too much effort. I either have it easy with coinbase or cryptos can fuck off
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:58
Yea true
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:56:44
What will happen when there are no more bitcoins to mine, what will happen to all theminers how will they profit?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:32:24
I can't find it, are you sure that's the correct name? Do you have a dif name?
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:27:21
Yea brotha! to the mooon!!! Lol Jk, just really happy bitcoin reached 11k, I've been holding since about 5k and it's been a ride.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:08:27
greed is the death of us all.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:47:29
m8 what do you mean dipped 30% in one week, shit is at $13500 atm. I don't know if I should invest my 20k right now or wait longer.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:28:55
no it can't be in limbo lol it either gets accepted or dropped within 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:27:12
Yea brotha! to the mooon!!! Lol Jk, just really happy bitcoin reached 11k, I've been holding since about 5k and it's been a ride.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:25:25
localbitcoins too risky irl. not sure about decentralized exchanges. paying for stuff directly = more expensive than using credit cards.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:13:59
how many workers do they have, how much does the owner make per day?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:46:49
what's an easy way to turn it into usd without coonbas?
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:27:03
Except when the price goes to 5k and then you will be so happy you didn't buy. xD coin goes both ways hommie
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:48:54
The concept just seems to foreign, like how would you even have this idea though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:21:42
You go to the bank tell them that you didn't receive the product or it was different or it wasn't you that sent the money, or you did it by mistake and they side with you and you keep the nonrefundable crypto and the $ (not saying that I would do it) just explaining what it is
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:57:58
Can bitcoins/cryptos be used for anonymous online payments for illegal stuff/evade taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:46:17
In that case we need improvement in exchanging fiat to bitcoin and bitcoin to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:50:53
why not use 2000 bit private keys, why stop at 256
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:51:58
Does this mean that all mining people just lost 25% every time they get a new coin? Since they are forced to sell to cover bills in fiat
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:22:27
I will only use a crypto once it's stable and low fees/fast.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:47:51
but why?
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:42:14
Hey man I have to ask an important question. Don't hate on me.
So the reason why I will not buy ethereum is because I believe there are a lot of people that invested into it, or mined eth when it was very cheap and are simply holding onto lots of it, to later dump when it has more value and thus screwing everyone who invested later.
Yes you can argue that the largest wallet in ethereum holds like 2%, but the same people can hold various wallets.
So for this reason, I cannot trust ethereum, because we know for a fact that when eth started, people knew of bitcoin and knew the potential to hoard it in the early days and one day they will dump big, which makes it very risky for anyone trying to get into it today.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:53:49
If I use my btc to buy stuff/trips/drugs I don't have to pay taxes right cause I never exchanged it for fiat?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:21:31
Gonna check them out. thanks
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:23:10
I read about a guy that took a loan and ivnested 100k usd into bitcoin at 11k usd per bitcoin. is he crazy?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:42:37
So how much btc is mined every day atm? So right now we have the miners that sell everyday bringing price down due to more supply and the ones that don't hold?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:17:11
I did come up to that answer, but it says it's anonymous, I want to know who it is exactly.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:17:17
could you potentially chargeback on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:14:04
kk around how much does it have to drop?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:36:39
For example a friend I have, I sent him about 0.03 bitcoins and he sent me $300 via paypal. (I trust him) I guess that transaction never really affected bitcoins value?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:43:12
Is cryptos an investment or gambling? Please I need help asaap
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:30:48
I got 20k to invest, was thinking of investing 1k into each crypto, (top 20) and holding for 10 years
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:54:16
So I'm just seeing all these guys saying they will hold for so long, but then I realize that they will one day dump because well they need USD to pay bills/taxes/etc. Which means that when a lot of the holders start dumping, some of them won't have buyers and the price will crash real fast.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:52:40
Yea that one is pretty straight forward.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:57:10
so they all need the "short.io" in front of them?
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:36:04
It's hard to separate money from true enjoyment in life isn't it? Once you realize that almost everything requires money it gets really hard to lose the relationship between money = happiness, but you must do it in order to actually be happy.
Because no matter what a lot of us will never be incredibly rich and just have to accept what we have and be happy with it. Don't confuse that with being mediocre, it's just acceptance and being happy with what you have while still striving for a better life.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:28:08
I mean if it tanked to 0, that's it, game over what good is it to check it
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:23
Thanks for the amazing work guys
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:20:58
Based on what? 
Also why wouldn't they admit to doing it?
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:02:04
I mean, what are all these people saying hold for lol, they will one day want to dump at a high price, and when that big dump happens, no one will be there buying or holding
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:28:08
I don't get it how are you supposed to sell your coins now if the price goes up?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:55:26
can you give me an example of what a shortened link looks vs one that's a safe one?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:51:45
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:40:50
andthe first miners would inmediatly mine a ton of bitcoin, since the difficulty would be pretty low since no one would be mining.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:02:45
people make mistakes. and what do you know, maybe that 30% was what they were willing to lose. if it goes down by 30% I'm out.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:54:08
So I'm just seeing all these guys saying they will hold for so long, but then I realize that they will one day dump because well they need USD to pay bills/taxes/etc. Which means that when a lot of the holders start dumping, some of them won't have buyers and the price will crash real fast.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:18:13
But how is it possible that we don't know exactly who it is, like this guy should be famous.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:25:24
But we all know that having x amount of money doesn't make you better than anyone else. A persons value isn't in their money but the way they act every day, their values, hard work etc.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:32:01
I mean we could argue 128 is unbreakable too
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:17:26
It's at 11k atm on coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:00:02
what happens if I transfer 5000 btc and only pay 1 cent in fees?
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:06:10
Yea that's why I like bitcoin and it's the only one I trust, because it was the first one.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:58:16
I know, but how do you avoid those thoughts, the one you just quoted, it's so hard to not think that way, and I'm sure a lot of people literally get depressed or anxious with those constant thoughts that continue popping into their heads each time they see the current price.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:47:26
But I don't understand why you would want to hide from such a great creation? Bitcoins helps everyone, why is he hiding. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:58:19
I mean don't people learn from the past though, there are people investing so much right now due to the incredible increase in just 1 month. Do they not realize the risk?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:06:33
What about the high fees
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:04:02
yea that good luck convinced me not to hire you
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:03:23
How come people are willing to invest into it at 11k, and long term users are talking about it going down?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:00:54
I mean believing doesn't make a difference. Actual hard changes to make it viable is what counts. You can believe all you want but if bitcoin doesn't hold any value besides storing it, then it's meant to fail. We need a solution to high fees NOW.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:49:11
If you aren't I'm sorry but why would they be frozen in Arizona?
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:27:15
mine it impossible at current difficulty. getting paid too high fees. buying bitcoin off of local bitcoin = asking for a death wish.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:00:09
Yea that's why I only trust bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:08:07
Well, the hacking part is impossible you and me know it.
As for finding someone irl out of their reddit account, that seems extremely hard if you haven't told anyone, probably impossible?
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:07:32
Alright thanks for the advice, have a good night it's late here and I have to go sleep. :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:00:13
what happens if I transfer 5000 btc and only pay 1 cent in fees?
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:29:36
because your bitcoin is safe behind a code no one knows, and no one can guess. If it was that easy no one would be buying bitcoin and or talking in @_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:55
how come we never see the other side of the story?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:06:57
Hmm, it's a tough call. But I mean 20k sitting in my bank in USD really won't get me anywhere will it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:26:19
By that time wouldn't bitcoin be a huge dif price from when I posted?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:49:00
Think I'll pass then, if you put it that way not up 2 a gamble tooo much stress, gonna make my hair fall out.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:24:40
Hmm but for people to say hold/to the moon, won't all these guys eventually dump?
Doesn't someone actually have to take a loss eventually, like there will be people losing on a lot of money or am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:12:38
Hey man, it's good for you to take some of the burden off, you've been holding for a long time. Grats!
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:50:53
How much did people lose when bitcoin went from $1200 to $200, did they get depressed?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:33:11
how do you know it's him
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:14:04
To the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:47:21
I mean lets be honest, every person that got rich off of bitcoin, got rich off of the moneyof others, so I mean giving a little back to the poor in the form of taxes is the least you can do.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:43:04
So how much btc is mined every day atm? So right now we have the miners that sell everyday bringing price down due to more supply and the ones that don't hold?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:51:54
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:02:19
I have decided to never buy bitcoin in terms of just it being more valuable later on, I will simply not gamble. I'm sorry it's not for me I don't want the stress of having my money in such a high fluctuation every day.
I can however use bitcoin on a daily basis for a product I sell and cash out immediately for the $ value I get.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:38:26
so all computers could go offline and that wouldn't affect anything? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:29:41
there's so many out there that I don't even know where to begin and after all of that businesses aren't really using any so much so that people have to buy bitcoin to buy alts. it's completely fucked
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:37:17
what about 8 byte seeds
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:27:56
I admire you for saying no to the addiction man, keep it up!
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:27:47
how many did panic sell
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:43:19
Yea lol and it moves so quickly
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:35:18
That's an alt coin like ethereum or litecoin right?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:30:21
what do you think about me grabbing 20k usd and investing it into the top 20 current cryptos and just hold for 10 years? (1k per crypto)
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:03:10
can a company as big as google or amazon that already have the hardware take over the nodes?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:48:28
Just read his post, he said he stored them for his heirs.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:42:47
So how much btc is mined every day atm? So right now we have the miners that sell everyday bringing price down due to more supply and the ones that don't hold?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:48:26
Hmm that reason seems weak, if we knew who started it, why would it limit collaboration or growth, we'd be at the same exact position.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:16:53
how does coinbase defend against a possible chargeback?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:19:42
you can't do those comparisons m8, you had no way of knowing bitcoins value in the future, and look at the people who bought in at 20k and it's now at 11k. Don't beat yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:27:32
Yea brotha! to the mooon!!! Lol Jk, just really happy bitcoin reached 11k, I've been holding since about 5k and it's been a ride.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:18:36
Idk at what value to buy, I think it's the lowest and it keeps going lower!
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:47:10
what if satellites go off tooo
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:57:11
Well apparently you can get hacked according to a lot of people saying "don't post how much btc you have" ALERT
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:44:00
what price did you buy t
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:12:40
damn that must be rough but I mean how else could they take $ from the common folk
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:53:05
Well I want something safe, no wild west. Just somewhere where I can invest my savings and then I can retire on that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:06:58
Yea the first part I get it completely, it's cashing out that's the problem. I've never cashed out, is it as simple as hooking up your bank account and cashing out with coinbase? What's the fee? Do they cash you out literally whenever you want or do you have to wait for them to get a buyer for your bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:06:26
Couldn't they be doing transactions with their own wallets to fake that volume?
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:34:54
Once you have enough to live without working, what do you do with all that free time?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:18:03
it has fallen almost 50% m8 it's at 11k atm
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:53:47
what altcoin should I use?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:43:47
I just don't understand how satoshi came up with this idea out of nowhere, like why wasn't there a crypto earlier
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:08:32
Is it possible for the CEO of coinbase to grab the private keys and steal all the bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:41:47
I don't mean to be hateful it just looks like it's turning into that scenario, even I am thinking of investing just for it to go up and then sell it later.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:40:42
Why do you need so much money? Why can't you be happy with what you've got?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:19:50
So invest that 120k, and never check btc price for another 10 years? And where would I hide my address info, in a bank safe?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:22:25
what if it goes even lower
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:20:14
How am I supposed to use it as a store of my wealth and use it as a currency to accept payments with my business if the next day I can literally lose it all.
What's the point? Help?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:29:57
well avoiding those thoughts is the first step to a healthy mind, and if not avoiding them, then learning how to block them immediately as a negative thought. We need to teach them on how to avoid those thoughts or block them, so that they don't post them.
But more than posting, those thoughts can drive people crazy, even suicidal. it's a real issue.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:50:37
It's low fees last time I sent $300 worth of btc and I only paid like 3 bucks on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:52:26
pretty sure you still gotta pay taxes on gambling
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:25:39
I will use them to remember you from this thread.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:35:50
Was it a team of people or only him
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:44:05
Okay but if in theory I did send 5000 btc and paid only $0.01 in fee, and I didn't have an advanced wallet that let me change the fee later on. What would happen to those 5000 coins.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:49:55
Why not encrypt them with 1024 characters, why stop at 256, we are talking about billions, lives everything is at stake
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:35:43
Hmm any idea if any of his family could hold some of his bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:04:28
people in this sub convinced me to not invest.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:20:57
The last thing I want to think about is meals lol especially now as I got fat again.
I was really fit and agile, but quit swimming and now I got fat again. Let's talk gains in gym membership, how many months of a gym I can get.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:16:36
I just wanted to know who to be grateful to and interview them and know what their thoughts were and how they came to the solutions and how hard was coding this whole thing 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:11:25
how do they avoid people doing this to profit. for example buy at a price.
if it goes up keep the large transaction and you profit.
if it goes down, cancel.

What do you mean seriously?

Once it gets dropped, it would return to my wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:14:17
You know what I always found interesting, the government takes a cut on the winners, but doesn't help out the losers.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:30:20
Norton costs similar like $30 per year I can't recall how much I paid.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:52:29
all the people that bought in and are now losing. I mean if it goes up and up and up no one ever loses and we are all happy, the moment it goes down, well people start getting angry/panic
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:03:58
Oh so it doesn't matter if I screw up fees, they will never get lost
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:03:14
Can you give me the exact amounts per each coin?
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:12:43
I like to think people are here for a new currency, not dependent on banks, with low fees and no chargebacks.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:51:36
i was talking to a dude that took a loan on 100k and invested it l0l
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:37:35
I agree, but assuming power could be restored 24 hours later. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:46:56
I mean if you actually made millions wouldn't you just retire, at what point do you stop needing more money?
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:54:11
Why are bitcoin users so afraid of alts? Would it really be that bad to sell our bitcoins and start using an alt that solves a lot of bitcoin's issues and actually use it as a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:56:27
risky as in you go in with 10k cash and they fuck you up lol
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:27:38
Yea brotha! to the mooon!!! Lol Jk, just really happy bitcoin reached 11k, I've been holding since about 5k and it's been a ride.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:27:02
I don't get his post, can anyone explain it please
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:43:55
I guess I'll join the train when that technology has ironed out all the bugs. Thoughts on that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:39:23
can you tell me which cryptos I should invest in?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:24:16
well I'm young right, I would save a little and add it every year so that I can retire and live off that.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:13:15
Pretty sure most windows in very tall buildings don't open at all or am I wrong
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:34:19
well shit if you put it like that lol i'm not buying bitcoin, I need to use my money for bills
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:33:53
But I mean wouldn't you get bored of those hobbies if you had everything you ever wanted?
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:09:47
so you're telling me there's not a single alt coin that hasn't solved decentralization and being able to scale exponentially?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:53:17
So you think there's no chance any of the top 20 cryptos will be worth much in 10 years?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:37:55
Isn't the amount of coins available continuously decreasing as more are mined?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:17:27
How is it possible that literally no one knows who it is. Like I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:47:12
how do I know someone isn't waiting to dump a big amount tho
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:52:16
why would it drop, just by people trying to sell and not getting usd?
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:22:53
How come a wallet can't get hacked? Can't I in theory guess every single digit in a wallet? Or get a huge amount of computers to try guesses to get into wallets, or get a quantum computer and get someones wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:07:17
So what happens when the hodlers do decide to sell?
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:01:37
Yea exactly this is how I feel. I haven't been able to use bitcoin for the last 4 years due it it's highly volatile price.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:59:56
what happens if I transfer 5000 btc and only pay 1 cent in fees?
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:15:25
While yes that's a possibility, we have to see bitcoin for what it is right now. It's not even wildly used, everything is based on expectations of what it could be,and people are buying in because they are quickly seeing it go up in value.
When these same people later on decide to sell because they made their profit, there won't be enough buyers to continue the cycle. Do you see what I'm saying?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:10:30
how can we ensure which crypto to leave to our descendants in 2140?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:40:01
I'm sorry but this is different, you can't get access to someones computer from knowing their reddit account/knowing they have a lot of bitcoin. 
You are pretty misinformed on how hacking and computers work.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:16:27
what's the point of tht power, you mean like telling other people what they can do?
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:23:51
Yea your loss but whatever, I mean yea why brag it gives you nothing and theremight be a risk.
I'm just trying to defend the point of view that there's no risk, but I agree no reason to brag
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:13:43
Yea it just sounds so demoralizing, imagine investing a good amount of your money and seeing it's value drop day by day, it would destroy you.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:22:35
No I'm not talking about bitcoin, I trust bitcoin, I'm talking about altcoins like eth, litecoin, etc that could be hoarded since they knew the value of bitcoin, and their only purpose is to one day dump it all and leave all of us that invested into these alt coins in the ground.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:56:34
Really? It could go down that much? People could lose tons
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:20
How can I pay the monthly bills then if I don't sell?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:58:42
we are fuked bro, first of all, bitcoin is the only coin we can trust, other coins were nivested into and will have huge dumps.
but at the same time bitcoin has the worst tech
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:18:33
if the fbi found him what would happen
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:03:31
why didn't you cash out at 18k
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:04:19
yea but give us specifics 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:34:20
are you kidding me, people just lost their houses, savings,cars and you are laughing here...
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:03:44
if he hodl's how am I going to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:27:40
So potentially someone could have invested 100 grand when it was $1000, and then they saw their usd drop to 20 grand?
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:26:48
Isn't it good that means less bitcoins are mined = less supply = price goes up?
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:03:33
That's not hacking, that's a torture.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:39:02
I mean if you ave a lot of money in there and it drops from $1200 to $200, that would be so rough, holy shit, literally depressive 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:04:16
So pretty much everyone that bought into bitcoin at over 10k is gambling?
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:53:37
So I'm just seeing all these guys saying they will hold for so long, but then I realize that they will one day dump because well they need USD to pay bills/taxes/etc. Which means that when a lot of the holders start dumping, some of them won't have buyers and the price will crash real fast.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:24:15
man this is so complicated. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:45:50
well but wtf is this then you can't use bitcoin as a currency cause of the fees
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:30:19
Ok we'll see though, we don't know how governments will react and if it will ever be used in day to day transactions. Or all the other issues atm. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:18:18
y u trolling bro
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:54:40
From the other replies, yours seems pretty off, assuming it's going to be stable at $11k, other people are saying it's a gamble, you might lose it all, be very careful etc.
Not remain calm it's gonna stay at 11k minimum.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:24:01
what if no one buys tho?
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:13:28
Currently they mine just like bitcoin, but when all coins are mined, then they will enter a "stake" system.
But my worry is of other people that got into it early, bought/mined a ton of them and are simply holding them till the point where they will dump them.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:27:19
No I need to understand why this is a mystery, why that guy decided to remain hidden or at-least a few reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:58:34
How often do gamblers in casinos suicide?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:16:07
Does that mean I would never get my btc again?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:38:30
How come so many people have actually gone in, some with thousands of dollars, are people really that dumb to gamble 50/50.
There has to be something else.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:59:21
Is norton antivirus bad? I pay for it on a yearly basis
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:57:26
And where would these bitcoins be then? If they aren't in my wallet, or in the receiving end?
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:13:26
This is what we need more off in this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:08:09
I mean it's an unrelated code, what's wrong with bragging how much bitcoins you have?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:39:25
Well any investment in any business has a chance you lose it, obviously the percentage changes.
With bitcoin people will literally call it a gamble though.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:31:03
I can get 50/50 odds if you want me to gamble. Better than all on black.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:50:44
Who covers that fee?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:52:06
I was checking it out and it's done by middle man also, and they take a pretty big chunk of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:43:49
can you tell me which altcoin I should use?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:30:54
is it possible to trade bitcoin for fiat without an exchange, just face to face with another person? Maybe cash we meet face to face, or paypal or a credit card purchase for bitcoin with no exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:57:59
I'ma be honest back when I heard about bitcoin about 4 years ago I was like yes! I canfinally stop using paypal and their stupid chargeback/service/fee's system. And then I realized that with bitcoin I still get fucked with fees. So now I'm fucked.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:58:20
so in what case would it crash to like less than 5k
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:32:29
I guess from that it's a no from me, I can't be keeping an eye on them and adjusting, I just wanted to hold all of them and just chill for 10years. Not read any news etc
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:46:07
I have 20k usd atm, what do you think of grabbing it and investing 1k into the top 20 cryptos atm and just holding for 10-20 years.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:27:43
Yea brotha! to the mooon!!! Lol Jk, just really happy bitcoin reached 11k, I've been holding since about 5k and it's been a ride.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:19:42
wouldn't another crook take their place? That's how governments work
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:07:07
I mean bro for bitcoin to take off we need the regular people just as much as the whales, so let's not discredit when someone loses their whole savings account.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:16:45
Yea he's a millionaire thanks to all the other guys who sold their houses and invested into it at the moment.
We will see if in 6 month the trend continues or the poor guys that did it on Nov/Dec get screwed.
We are talking about gambling here not an investment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:17:38
How do you know this is the dip?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:47:56
I'm not saying I would do it, just explaining to you what a chargeback is.
It's a real risk to any online business as there are shitty people online. I wonder how coinbase protects itself.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:51:46
wait, if you panic at-least you get to keep 90% on a 10% loss. You better lose 10% than 60%. Maybe you realize that investing is just not for you.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:17:25
wait but I need to pay bills and shit lol, you want me to buy it and hold so that one day I'll be rich or what's your goal?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:48:08
I mean, what you consider stupid, might not be stupid to another person, it all depends how new/knowledgeable you are in a topic. So please refrain from commenting if you don't have anything positive to add to it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:03:47
can you give me an eli5 on why this is important and how it works?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:22:11
kk ty
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:15:50
But once you are at those levels, doesn't life stop having a meaning?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:59:31
Don't you think it's interesting how a password is just a bunch of random letters that anyone could potentially guess, (although with the numbers we've talked it's virtually impossible) But still there is that possibility, pretty cool huh.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:03:11
wait what do you mean it will be solved somewhere in the future, we already have the bitcoin source code, there has to be a solution, how big of a problem can this be.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:50:52
How do I know you don't have bitcoin waiting for me to buyand you sell it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:45:32
can coinbase's owner just grab all the coins in cold storage they have atm and steal them and then get all that free $$?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:43:41
Because the question surged from your answer.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:28:33
How do you avoid those comments though, the mind just keeps tricking you into thinking that's actually a possibility.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:39:55
yea jut read the story of the guy who suicided after seeing bitcoin reach 10k when he had a ton in 2013
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:52:14
How come I've seen it go up all the time since like 2 months ago
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:56:10
I'm sorry idk if she was nervous but she really didn't answer the questions with any specifics, just general crap.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:04:20
I mean ross was a real criminal from what I just read online.
I guess I will never find out. Are other creators from other alt coins well known?
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:23:27
Idk, right now I have a job that's pretty stressful, and also I'm studying something in university that I don't think I want to do, and I feel like they are wasting my time since I haven't learned much. (I'm missing 1 year till my bachelors)
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:49:22
I guess that's an interesting point of view, would you say you would stop working a real job as soon as you could pay for your hobbies/bills.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:01:04
So now I'm thinking of potential fraud, where you send bitcoins with very low fees, get a product and then the bitcoins return to you, but the other person doesn't wait for the confirmations for w/e reason.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:33:44
Do you really want to have a conversation on the meaning of the word "weird"?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:05:08
Yep well said.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:40:02
sometimes you might just misclick tho
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:22:38
But won't we all be dead by 2140?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:58:49
Interesting, so basically banks and governments would try to murder him? 
I mean once bitcoin was started there is nothing to stop it, so why does it even matter if we know who it is.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:06:59
How did you discover that you enjoyed those hobbies so much, I haven't found any.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:23:54
I think the next step is actually having bitcoin be useful in day to day transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:12:38
I also have 120kusd ready to invest into bitcoins, 70k are mine, and 50k are from my parents.
Should I go all in atM?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:56:43
Are you sure that simply clicking one of those can actually cause harm? Don't they need the usual administrator install permissions etc
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:47:00
Studying business. Feels like everything I've learned I could of learned it way faster on my own. And also feels pretty depressing after I finish my Bachelors because starting my own business and competing with huge corporations sounds impossible so it's even more demotivating, and I don't really want to work for someone else at-least for this career since it's pretty low paying.
Also I need to know at what point are you content with what you have, or at what point do you keep striving for more money.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:54:26
So I'm just seeing all these guys saying they will hold for so long, but then I realize that they will one day dump because well they need USD to pay bills/taxes/etc. Which means that when a lot of the holders start dumping, some of them won't have buyers and the price will crash real fast.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:43:38
Can you give me the exact date that will happen? Also is a fork necessary for that?
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:50:37
I mean it's not hard to know who has money just go to any rich neighborhood l0l
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:48:50
then why is that guy memeing about me being the fbi? he's lost?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:40:18
hmm in what sense?
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:08:56
you just told me they are shit then tell me to use them.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:42:49
So what's the plan
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:01:13
Yep it's a meme fest. Although I've learned a lot from here.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:27:17
Without exchanges how would we use bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:40:52
You don't get to tell anyone to stop saying their opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:29:11
You can't come into r/bitcoin and post that message...
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:51:17
so if the coinbase ceo waned, he could send all the bitcoin stored by coinbase on their private keys to a another private acc and even if he goes to jail no one will ever recover that money?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:04:55
do they have any reason to?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:57:27
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:53:18
well it's not a dip if it doesn'tgo back up lol, ifyou buyand it goes lower and stays lower then you're fucked
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:18:00
you mean someone that makes a million dollars a day?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:13:56
What's a better idea, to invest in cryptos or an investment fund? Talking about my life savings. (want to retire)
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:04:19
Thanks for this thread quiting college and investing my savings into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:51:15
im still ocnfused, how the fuck is so much money into this shit without  being sure about the future are youf ucking kidding me what the fuck
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:50:19
oh tru eif you use coinbase you cant really avoid fees can you
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:50:55
What's the use case right now? Just buy and hoard it till it goes up in value?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:53:39
Well I can't use bitcoin as a currency if it's going to fluctuate this much.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:05:03
You lose/forget your key and thus all your money. The end.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:59:20
This is a little rant from someone that loves cryptos/bitcoin and just wants to use it as a currency. As a better alternative than paypal/other payment methods. Because you can send for low fees to anywhere in the world and safely without chargebacks/paperwork. What's with this mentality of holding onto bitcoins and not using them? Bitcoins are meant to be used, to be spent for goods and services, or to be sent to other people just like you would with normal money. I'm tired of all this people that just want to buy and and hide it in their house for no reason. This makes the value fluctuate which makes it hard for people actually trying to use it as a currency. You already know that those guys that are not using it as a currency, will eventually dump it all because they only want to profit from it, instead of using it for it's intended purpose(a currency). So this will cause a massive crash when it happens as the value of bitcoins is not being held true by it's usage, but by people that just hold onto it for no other reason than to dump it later.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:25:42
What if bitcoins drops to $1000per coin?
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:26:30
There's a bunch of classes tht waste your time, a bunch of meaningless quizzes, homeworks and projects where you learn nothing. 
Yes there are also the good professors and classes, but if your university isn't good, then you are wasting your time.
You are better off learning on your own via the internet/buying the same books they use in classes..
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:33:45
So coinbase could just scam quit on me at any point in time and take my money?
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:02:59
Did you even read what I wrote, has nothing to do with bitcoin being adopted or not.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:48:01
I can't be using bitcoin as a currency if in 2 to three days It will drastically change.
I need it to be stable...
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:39:55
What would be the best way to avoid taxes if you wanted to covert lets say 100 bitcoins to usd.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:11:08
Ok sorry m8, I was just trolling idk, I'm pretty stressed out right now as I'm making some decisions and I'm not sure what to do exactly. Also I'm trying to rid the thought of money money money all over my head.
HOpe you understand. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:16:46
Will bitcoin ever be stable, or as stable as USD and Euros?
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:12:10
How do I avoid coinbase stealing my bitcoins?
Could I store 100grand in btc in coinbase without them robbing me?
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:37:33
How has paypal not ran bankrupt? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:39:38
I mean let's be honest, bitcoin is supposed to be a currency, you are supposed to use it.
It's  not something you just buy and keep it there stored in so that no one else can use it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:22:07
I hope that age comes soon.
Like if I had $1000 in bitcoins, I could be relatively safe in having $1000 in 1 week/month.
I'm tired of all this people just buying and trying to hold it for no reason other than profit. Making it fluctuate and risky to use as a currency.

Yea but if I only have 100k usd atm,I don't want to invest it into something where I can have 200k tomorrow or 0.
I'd rather have it stored in a safe bank in a first world country.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:48:57
I will never trust any other coin other than bitcoin, how can I know it wasn't premined by hoarders waiting for it to go up just to dump it all?
And even if you say oh look biggest wallet has like 1% of all coins, they could have multiple wallets.

This is a little rant from someone that loves cryptos/bitcoin and just wants to use it as a currency. As a better alternative than paypal/other payment methods. Because you can send for low fees to anywhere in the world and safely without chargebacks/paperwork. What's with this mentality of holding onto bitcoins and not using them? Bitcoins are meant to be used, to be spent for goods and services, or to be sent to other people just like you would with normal money. I'm tired of all this people that just want to buy and and hide it in their house for no reason. This makes the value fluctuate which makes it hard for people actually trying to use it as a currency. You already know that those guys that are not using it as a currency, will eventually dump it all because they only want to profit from it, instead of using it for it's intended purpose(a currency). So this will cause a massive crash when it happens as the value of bitcoins is not being held true by it's usage, but by people that just hold onto it for no other reason than to dump it later.

If I have 100k usd in my bank account how can I buy bitcoins and keep them secure?
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:42:54
If I wanted to avoid taxes, can I just buy items in bitcoins and be a happy camper?

Alright so I would like to use bitcoin as a payment system but I really dislike the fact that it fluctuates so much.
At what point will the supply/demand be stable enough where we don't get these huge changes so quickly. 
So that I can use bitcoin as a currency instead of something to hoard and take the risk of it going up or down.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:54:25
Cause the bank stores it little guy, past your bedtime now?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:14:01
The weird part is that a lot of buyers simply hold onto them for nothing.
My usage of bitcoins is to use it as a currency to change for goods and services, which I imagine is the original intent of it.
These hoarders make it hard for me to use bitcoins as it makes the price way too crazy going up and down up and down.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:59:08
So how would I access my bitcoins without coinbase, I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:51:22
so Why do so many people use coinbase? What's the point I'm just risking it for no reason?
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:29:17
ahah nooooob its now at 11000, what u feel?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:31:15
I'll be honest with you, if I had let's say 2000 bitcoins right now, I would have sold all of them at 10k.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:05:45
laws are important, they keep business in check, imagine if the cheapest way to dump shi tin the ocean would be to dump the trash, instead ships have to go to shore and dump it properly.

people can know how much money you have all the time just go to a rich neighborhood, an expensive car.
We need to stop money laundering and illegal business. and having monero is a crime and determent to progress.
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:06:45

@_date: 2018-02-05 16:44:10

@_date: 2018-02-02 14:14:23

What are you talking about? Bitconnect promises 1% daily returns lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:18:27
There's something I don't get, for people to make money buying bitcoin other people have to buy at a higher price and if no one buys higher then those guys lose?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:21:33
Honestly worse case scenario we stay even or go back up at this point.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:40:40
tell me exactly when to buy the dip
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:11:34
I mean but with that mentality I'd rather just buy a vacations at a 5 star hotel in mexico? Like why would I put in what I can lose might as well use it on something fun right.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:16:54
Yea but if everyone sells for the same reasons you did then bitcoin will lose price...
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:51:28
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:04:16

Can you tell me why everyone blindly tells me to invest in government bonds?
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:18:58
lol man I'm just thinking about that guy that went from 1 btc to 14 btc trading and lost it all. FEELSBADMAN.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:51:11
Yea lol now that I think about it it doesn't really make sense.
But from my point of view I'm not really trying to "lose" anything. so if I went all in with my savings I wouldn't be thinking that I could lose.
That's why when you tell me that put in what I can lose I'm like better go to that hotel.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:10:42
hey at the end of the day they're rich and you aren't, go back to your 9 to 5 job slave

@_date: 2018-02-02 12:19:05
why the fuck would 51% ownership dig their own grave, you think those fuckers want to lose money? The moment they start doing shady shit, bitcoins price will be worth nothing and their whole infrastructure and 51% goes to shit, it's in their interest to keep everyone happy.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:45:13
So what do you want us to do?
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:17:54
