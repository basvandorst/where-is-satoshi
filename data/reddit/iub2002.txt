Yes I got it done earlier this a.m.
Exporting the private key from my Multibit account and importing it to my new wallet on blockchain.info did the trick and the transaction was confirmed/completed within minutes. My BC.info wallet shows the proper balance. I feel much better knowing that I still have my btcs! This was quite a learning experience. Thx so much to you and everyone who responded...much appreciated!

Apparently I did. It shows a fee of .0001 bitcoins. How does that affect the transfer or the time it takes?

If my main intention is to get the btcs sold/traded for USD asap, then what is the best place to open up a new wallet?
And once I have the new wallet, I assume there's a way for me to import that private key...and when I do so, the 1.5 btc will appear in that new wallet?

Unfortunately I don't even know what the 'hash id' is...sorry I'm a newbie to this. I see it still says 'seen by 1 peer. pending/unconfirmed' in the transaction details but not sure if that is the hash id. I might need more explanation to follow your advice.

I think I have figured out how to get my private key, and I've set up a new account/wallet on the blockchain.info site. When it asks me to import my private key in the new blockchain.info wallet, I put in the key and it seems to match up properly with my public address and the correct balance of ~1.5 btcs. But I get the following message:
"Never import a private key from a public or untrusted source. This includes common brain wallets, competitions and purchased private keys. Instead we recommend to sweep the key, which means to send all the funds to one of your existing addresses rather than actually adding a new address to your wallet." Then it gives me the option to 'Import Directly' or 'Sweep Key'. 
Which do I want to do; Import Directly or Sweep Key (which it seems they recommend but I'm just curious what others think)??? After I select one of these, then I'll see the balance of 1.5 btcs in my wallet on Blockchain.info?

Thank you for that info...I had been using the address I sent the bitcoins TO in blockchain.
However, when I search for the address it was sent FROM, this transaction still doesn't appear in blockchain. The address I sent from does come up in blockchain and it shows 1 transaction (which was when I received the 1.5 bitcoins into my Multibit wallet a few days ago)...but it does NOT show the transaction I put thru yesterday to transfer the 1.5 bitcoins from Multibit wallet to my localbitcoins.com wallet. 
It's been over 24 hours now and I'm rather nervous that my bitcoins seem to have disappeared. I've search all over the web on various forums and can't really get any info or answers that seem to explain where my bitcoins are or if/when the transaction will go thru and they'll appear in my localbitcoins.com wallet.
Could they have disappeared and be unrecoverable?

what link would you need? It's been maybe 6 hours now and nothing has changed. I copied and pasted the btc address that I sent the money to (which was generated by localbitcoin.com and given to me) into a search in blockchain.info and the address shows up but it says "Number of Transactions: 0".
One thing that made me expect this to go thru very quickly was a little help link on the localbitcoin.com website that says receiving transaction times "usually range from minutes, up to one hour" so I got a little freaked out when nothing went thru. I'll remain patient.
Thx!
