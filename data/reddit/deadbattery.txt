I am having the same issue as well. It will buy sometimes and close out but if I want to get coins I have to keep opening and closing the script until I get them.

So the only down side of this method would be if you were to assume that you workstation is infected so when you import your private key the hacker that deployed the virus also knows now. Since you decided to relay  your leftover coins back to the same private key you have given him access to all your money. 
For added security would it be better to send your BTC to another brain wallet afterwards or to use whatever private key that has been issued after you spent your money with your original brain wallet?
Thanks for the reply!

I just did a BitInstant transaction yesterday and it took less than 5 minutes

Yes, I have seen the same reports as well that Coinbase makes right on their software's wrongdoing but if its a problem that cannot be rectified unless intervention from the staff then that software should not be used until it is fixed.

I look forward to hearing good things about this website. Looks like a excellent idea and I'll definitely use the site if not just for the support of bitcoin and the people who support it.

Their service is excellent. Bear in mind that it's beta and it does say so but any problems you have is usually fixed by there staff pretty fast. It'll be the easiest way to buy bitcoins when you get it set up.

I've used it. The only down side is you have to wait a good while and you can be impatient when you first get into Bitcoins but if you are looking for a hassle free way to get Bitcoins go with Coinbase.

I think the max you wait is 10 days but I've received some in under a week

True story. Luckly I bought them when they were around 27 and some change so Im only out 20 bucks or so. The thing the really gets me is the whole waiting part, which I realize is a necessary part of it I suppose,  but then to cancel at the last minute. I hope they can get their act together because it seemed like a promising site.

so all the sell orders are just people with previously set buy orders for way under what the market was selling for before a huge lag/dip in price?

He's gonna shit himself when he catches wind of this tip.

After a couple of emails Coinbase has "whitelisted" my account and has pushed through the transaction for the 10 BTC I purchased at the rate that was locked in when I bought them several days ago.

Question about this. What if I have 100 BTC in my wallet and I spend 2 BTC so the left over 98 BTC is in my new wallet. Can I just send the remaining 98 BTC back to my previous Brain Wallet and then delete the new wallet.dat file that has my brain wallet imported into it? After all said is and done then I moved the original 100 BTC into two parts one the 2 BTC I sent away to John Doe and then the left over 98 BTC which I resent right back to my original Brain Wallet which now contains 98 BTC and now I have the remaining balance still in the same original wallet.
