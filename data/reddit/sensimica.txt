Most people have recommended amazing foundations that do a lot of good for humankind. I honestly hope Kola Kariola gets a bit of attention too ( and money). I have never seen a person more committed than this guy to help stray animals from Romania. I don't know what people know about how things are with stray animals in this country, but you would cry and lose hope in all humanity if you saw/heard some stories. The brutality and lack of care these animals are treated with in official animal shelters is something our of horror stories. Well this guy has managed to build a shelter from his own funds and donations for about 400 dogs plus horses, goats, cats and other animals people dump on his doorstep. He drives across the entire country to rescue dogs that are on the brink of death, he once rescued a dog who's paws had been cut off with an axe and left to bleed to death. He gave him prosthetic paws, he's a happy dog now. He also got the media to write about a dog shelter in a smaller town in Romania where the dogs were beat to death instead of given lethal injections or whatever, because the people in charge would steal the money that were supposed to be used to buy lethal injections. So it really breaks me to see that this guy is periodically struggling to provide food or electricity for the 400 dogs he has in his shelter. Given the right amount of money, this guy and his foundation could change how stray animals are treated/are dealt with in Romania.
