Bitcoin would be useable if Coinbase made the switch. Fees would be low, confirmations would be faster. But bCash and Roger wouldn’t want that. Fuck Coinbase.

Something is fishy with Coinbase, bCash and Ver in my opinion.

You can search XRP on Coinbase and it’s the only non listed crypto to appear if searched. Works the same if you just search Ripple. Neither is listed in the article they link them to but shows potential. I am also big on XRP and think it’s leaps ahead of others. Makes a lot of sense for them to add ripple.

Core developers and blockstream are intentionally limiting BTC and making it only useable for “wealthy” first worlders. Second layer scaling isn’t working and fails to send. LN is unreliable. Catering to financial institutions is horeshit with LBTC.

The true vision of Satoshi is still innovative. On chain scaling is needed to keep Bitcoin Bitcoin.  0 conf transactions, fast, and cheap are nothing BTC can do.

I don’t talk openly about my crypto often but during the BTC BCH battle I managed to make some extra bitcoin during the spike. Monday mornings us field guys and our boss have a meeting to talk about the upcoming week and talk about our weekends. I said I managed to make some extra bitcoin which was nice. My boss asked what’s bitcoin and my 2 coworkers said it’s legalized money laundering. My boss now thinks I’m up to no good since he’s good friends of my 2 coworkers and believes them. I tried to explain it and he just thinks computers print money which is stealing and it’s for criminals because Silk Road.

No. I’ll wake up and it will be down. I’ll probably buy. Bitcoin Cash is up. I expect a rally up 1700 or even 2000 this weekend. It’s just weird it’s going up and isn’t natural. Buy in the dip. In 2 weeks the low will be 7500. I expect these Bitcoin Cash changes until the new year. With Coinbase holding them I expect them to go down. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:34:32
Just like with Bitcoin Cash. They won’t release it until it’s worthless. My ledger Nano s comes today and I can’t wait to pull everything off of Coinbase and never use them again.

Government taking over a miners ability to control their rigs and pools. So essentially take control of Bitmain, botnets, attack exchanges.  With a super powerful quantum computer, and a few of them like I believe the US has I still think they could attack the internet entirely for a few days and stop it.
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:53:01
More in the sense of total control of everyones internet not necessarily a covert mining farm.

Agreed but if those agencies teamed up to take over multiple entities/pools covertly and acted at once whats stopping them? I am a big conspiracy guy also. I dont think they are satoshi but I think they killed Hal Finney who I am 100% certain knew/was Satoshi.

Andreas talked about this. The amount energy credit cards consume are not known. They have hundreds of employees, running servers, in major sky scrappers, back offices etc.  Do credit cards in the world consume more electricity than Bitcoin? Probably not but the benefits to the world of decentralized electricity that will push mining is beneficial.

@_date: 2018-07-03 02:17:41
I think that’s a good goal. 
21,000,000 bitcoins. 0.1BTC puts you in the top 210,000,000 holders of BTC by default. In theory, if BTC takes over, 0.1 is all you need. 
Does this logic make sense to anyone else?
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:01:58
Bitcoin can’t micro transaction. Why even use it?! In all cases credit cards and cash are better.

Hey, I had a thread banned for this same reasoning. I don’t understand how first mover is worth billions. Better coins should one day be worth more than BTC. How is a faster, cheaper coin worth less? I understand lightning network is coming and all but superior coins exist.

@_date: 2018-04-24 01:50:52
I need help, don’t bail on me. 
First mover has value because it paves the way for other crypto. No bitcoin, not interest/value. 
On chain scaling is difficult. SegWit is still being implemented. Only segwit addresses are efficient. Going from one to another is still costly. The blinded “hodlers” won’t pay those fees. BCash is currently more useable. And I hate all Bitcoin forks as a fan of Crypto. A forked coin can’t possibly have a value of millions because a developer decided to fork. 
Bitcoin can do it better? I understand onchain scaling is happening but a coin like XLM does it without lightning. And they will implement lightning which is over 10,000 transactions per second. They have their own staking method. What happens when POW becomes invaluable? Only ASICs builders can provide the power to truly compete now. BTC is not truly decentralized.  Mining pools still contribute to centralization. 
Unless I’m missing something it’s kinda ignorant to say BTC is the best coin if it has to adopt other tech. I don’t want to start a major debate but what am I missing? The price of BTC dies if Satoshi sells. The price is partially propped by people who can’t access coins from the old days. 
I would have a harder time understanding how printing money out of thin air works. It’s just that I don’t understand how currently bitcoin is so valuable if other tech is better besides solely a first mover.
