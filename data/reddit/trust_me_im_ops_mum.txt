I just bought some more. It’s now $9400. Might be at $10,000 before lunch!

Great explanation. Now where Can I get one of these Beyoncé sweaters?

I’ve been watching it all day on btcmarkets hoping it’ll hit 10k. Closest it’s been is something like $9860.

Looks great! I’d change the font to be a little less heavy. And also use a dark grey rather than a black.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:44:26
Divide $50,000 by 20.
if 1btc = $50,000
0.5btc = $25,000
0.05 btc = $2500

Btcmarkets is the best in my opinion. Low fees. check out r/bitcoinaus as well if you need more info.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:44:42
Yep just saw! Woot!
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:27:24
I'm going to say $12,862 AUD which is USD$9876
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:59:47
Btcmarkets still saying $8900. I didn’t get my coinjar notification. Man, we are going to hit $10k so quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:23:53
$9940... will it crack 10...
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:39:27
No I’m not.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:44:17
Try some of the google fonts. Roboto and monserrert are both good for darker heavy fonts without the eye strain.

There was also [this petition]( to change the name from the dollar to Dollarydoos.

Since there is a limited amount of coins, and more and more people are starting to invest, won’t that make the price go up? (New to this, so if I’m wrong, could you explain why)
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:58:29
If you put 100 euro in today to buy bitcoin, and forget about it for 5 years, by historical growth of bitcoin, you should have 209,843 euros in oct 2022. It’s never too late. It’ll probably go up and down in that time, but just hodl til you need it.

True, but with bitcoin, people who buy, won’t just buy once, they’ll keep buying, right? The more it explodes, the more people want to invest. And the more popular it gets, the more people will hear about it and buy. 
It’s true the number of people using tv and internet isn’t growing exponentially, but the way it’s used is constantly changing, so people are using it in different ways they weren’t before. E.g home internet, then on your phone, then on your watch, to devices in your home like tvs, books, fridges. In that way, I feel like the internet has grown. Again, I’m not an expert, but I still think that crypto is a baby, and more booms will come.

Damn, I should of had a pie for lunch.

They’re usually pretty quick! 
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:01:10
I woke up on oct 29th, 2018, checked my coins as I usually do, saw this, and freaked out and came back today. Lucky I took a screen shot. VTC is at $14 as well.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:28:47
No worries my child
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:45:47
Holy crap, 2 million worth at $5! I wonder if he sold any or if he still owns it all.
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:05:51
Also, how did you work out the bitcoin daily average? I’m trying to work out the daily average for ripple. Where did you get the data?
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:44:57
When you add a coin, you choose BTC/AUD and it automatically selects btcmarkets as the exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:37:31
Oh man, this site is cool, but makes me sad I didn’t invest way earlier!
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:59:03
Yeah I saw that one too. I was wondering who they were.
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:14:40
Or on sept 14th when it was under $4000!
