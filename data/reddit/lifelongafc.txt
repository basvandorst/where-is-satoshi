I'm terrified that some dumbass will actually follow what your username says to do.

I was going to post the exact same thing. Futures is making this boring.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:17:40
This would be yuuuuuuuuge

Ledger s or trezor are generally the top 2 on the market.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:18:34
So this is relatively similar to Iota's Tangle then?

That's awesome! Thanks for letting me know! I've only really used the app for the most part. Definitely setting this up

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:23:19

@_date: 2017-12-14 21:04:00

@_date: 2017-12-04 23:40:36

I sold all of mine between today and yesterday. took in ~ 1.7x principle. waiting for a quick dip then jumping back in the fun. will probably do this over and over again. gets higher owner % 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:38:29
I waited for a lower price in 2013, 2014, 2016, and this year. Bought in around 14x what it was back then. 3k higher than when I was going to buy in this summer. Buy in slowly and consistently to hit any dips along the way.

What is supposed to happen when you can trade bitcoin futures? is there any info on that? ELI5 if possible! 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:10:57
Same could be said about stocks. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:13:04
bought at 7203. im still happy. waiting to buy more next time it dips.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:46:56
that, and "do i sell now?"
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:52:58
I continue to hear "Bitcoin has many more uses and applications" but have never understood that. Can someone eli5 how to use it outside of an investment or currency? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:46:30
So in an either/or, does this mean buy or sell?
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:00:29
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck I thought it was true.
