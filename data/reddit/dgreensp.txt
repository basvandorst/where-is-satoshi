Because deposits take "10 business days" to clear.

I've been looking into the same thing lately, hoping to get some arbitrage going on.  Getting money in and out of exchanges tends to be disappointingly costly and slow.
In theory, the fastest way to get money between exchanges (potentially faster than moving bitcoins!) is to swap coupons (aka vouchers or redeemable codes).  BTC-e and BitStamp, for example, both let you create and redeem coupon codes with values in USD.  There are sites where you can exchange these codes, but they are crappy; they are either always out of inventory, have outrageous fees (up to 7%), or aren't completely automated.  The ones I know of are BitInstant, AurumXchange, and ecurrencyzone.net (not .com, which confusingly is a sister site with different currency options).  I check these sites often, but I haven't done a single exchange, either because the inventory wasn't there, the rate wasn't worth it, or I just got sketched out.
Ok, on to money transfers.  It turns out OKPAY is the best option.  I created an account with them, verified my address and identity, and successfully used them to make a positive profit off of the cheap euros on BTC-e (buy euros, withdraw them to OKPAY, convert them, and send them back).  After fees, the profit was extremely tiny (a fraction of a percent), but it proved the concept at least.  The fee is 2% and transfers take about 24 hours.  I haven't tried wiring money in or out of OKPAY yet (I hate waiting!) but for what it's worth, I consider them legit.
