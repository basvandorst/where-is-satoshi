The price fluctuations were precisely one of a pump and dump, small volume pops intraday right before a huge volume spike, coinbase announces BCH to their exchange causing huge volume and whoever had positions dumped causing everyone panic and selling out on the market. That 9k number on BCH was real just lack of liquidity halted trading until it settled down around ~3k. This was right out of a case study found in OTCBB markets.

hell yeah, come back when we hit 300k!! yeah !!1

Albeit it could be recognized as insider trading due to the mere fact bitcoin isn't a security you cannot consider it insider trading and therefore it's not prosecutable. Even if the allegations are true, everything coinbase has done is completely legal.

Full of novice investors who don't care about the technology but rather the price, that's what happens when it becomes mainstream and not some small niche community. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:29:21
This is an unprecedented form of technical analysis but in the recent 4 price hikes you've seen 4 tEFs and according to my chart we can see another tEF forming, buy and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:47:13
No, it's true. Exchanges like coinbase and gdax were honoring buy/sell orders for 6~8k momentarily.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:20:51
bet muh decentralized currency!! i trust satoshi more than the government!!!`11
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:29:09
Everyone wants to be a hipster and appear cool because they own bitcoin and know the basic fundamentals of blockchain 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:26:35
Bitcoin is currently in a huge bubble and it just took a hard pull back. You're batshit crazy if you think it will increase 200% from current day price in just mere 3 months. Go learn how to manage money properly, not throwing it into bitcoin and praying. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:20:52
lmao i have alt coins not shit coin, i'm just here to hear you bitcoin spammers cry in tears
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:27:26
B-cash was pumped by coinbase and dumped when it went from 9k back to 3.5k, bitcoin was not pumped or dumped.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:22:12
Sell all of you bitcoin and never come back 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:28:26
yeah!! let me spew my uninformed speculative opinion as expertise knowledge and say 30k by next year!~! yeah~!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:47:59
double down bye the dip!!!!11``
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:53:19
Obsolete with a new cryptocurrency offering far better technology
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:30:52
in just mere 24 hours it's absurdly funny how wrong you are
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:45:02
there's plenty of people on r/bitcoincash complaining how they bought for 6~8k, exchanges honored until 9k and froze all trading 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:42:37
no, it hit 9k, some people did have buy/sell orders for 6~9k.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:36:44
yeah dude drones operated through the block chain funded by bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:20:40
Lol, you really think your bitcoin will increase 200% in 3 months? Absolutely delusional. Speculate in cryptos because you have nothing better to do with your money, don't get into it because of dreams of luckily hitting big in an extremely volatile market, because chances are it will turn into 10 days of rent. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:36:03
First mover advantage 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:24:38
they will recover, bitcoin wont 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:45:56
John McAfee is a total crazy person drunk on some nice sugary kool-aid. You really think it would be hard for the Chinese government to find and infiltrate miners? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:04:40
lmao, you really hit the pinnacle of delusion if you think that's true, go get yourself checked out at the local psych ward. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:06:44
high transaction costs and time, bitcoin is a ticking time bomb 
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:05:23
But you don't have an entire regulatory body who can essentially obstruct volume, it's very plausible that the IMF could pressure other countries to regulate bitcoin and thus move all volume to their newly created cryptocurrency, and the incentive to sign off on this order as a leader of a country is fairly easy to find. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:06:00
Completely delusional thinking if you believe that bitcoin couldn't be contained by the international community, countries would much rather exchange their bitcoin supply towards an IMF cryptocurrency that can be manipulated centrally and has liability. Bitcoin isn't disrupting global finances at this juncture to be contained by an authority like the IMF, but if we were to follow the current trajectory it will no doubt become a certainty and it’s just a matter of time when international tinkering will come in to play. Today in fact, the head of the IMF expressed harsh feelings towards bitcoin and expressed the idea of a IMF cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:57:30
This is an insanely dumb idea and I'm writing this to you as a current holder of Bitcoin. This is basic asset management 101 and you perpetuate the stereotype of longtime bitcoin holders, putting 50% of your paycheck in something as volatile as bitcoin is crazy. Also, you should consult different lines of inquiry, people here including me make money when someone decides to buy bitcoin so it's only logical for people here to be applauding your decision. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:26:31
I suggest you read up on how markets work and what fuels a market. Bitcoin is fueled by futurological speculation, unlike cash bitcoin doesn't have a high velocity and the majority of bitcoin is stored in vaults, which is to say investors who are driving up the price aren't buying bitcoin based on its current intrinsic value and payment parameters, obviously. You fall under a fallacy that bitcoin has high velocity and that the average bitcoin holder is actually using bitcoin as a currency, albeit this may be the utopian goal it's clear that the cryptocurrency market is looking for a currency hierarchy whether that be bitcoin, Ethereum, or ripple. In order for cryptocurrency to "hit the moon", it has to be mainstream for vendors and a governmental regulatory body can easily obstruct this through an authority like the IMF.
