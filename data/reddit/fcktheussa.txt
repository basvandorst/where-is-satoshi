It doesn't matter in the sense that you just need to know that bitcoin's 30 day volatility is nearing gold's volatility.

It's easy why the price can keep declining.
Apparently it was massively overvalued.
I hope we're near the bottom and I also think we're about there.
When more people realize we've reached a bottom and the price starts to rise slowly there is a whole army of new bitcoiners who will jump in and let the price skyrocket again.

Peter, what do you actually want at the moment? You're pointing to an old post post discussing a 20 mb. proposal but it seems like 8 mb is more on the table.

I think network scalability and transaction fees will become a trade off. When the miners will need to reserve the value of the bitcoins by discouraging transactions because blocks are too big, they will do so by pushing out low value transaction with fees.

The only scenarios I can imagine are:
1. A significant better altcoin that hasn't been invented yet
2. Some critical flaw in Bitcoin
3. Governments hacking down on Bitcoin
Number 2 isn't very likely anymore since the tech is 6 years old and has been through all kinds of challenges.
Number 3 will cause a serious drop in price but won't kill it. Bitcoin could still grow to become the dominant currency. It could give alts an advantage though who are more low key.
Number 1 is the most likely scenario to happen some time in the future, but will it actually happen and will it be good enough to overcome Bitcoin's nerwork effect. Besides, if you're in Bitcoin you'll find switching to an altcoin is fast and easy.
Personally I'm very confident to hold bitcoins.

No, start with small amounts for practice.

Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:33:49


No it's not. Their main argument is that there is a risk for mining to become centralized.
Are you saying Peter Todd, Wladimir van der Laan and Nick Szabo are also in on this little dirty plan?
Your post is a joke, you are a joke.
You are from the Bitcoin Foundation. You should bring a well balanced opinion to the table, not fud.
The foundation is a joke and so are you.
@_date: 2015-08-04 06:28:22
Well, that would be nice too.
Where I'm aiming at though is that sometimes I need to wait 1 to 3 confirmations after sending my coins. Then I want to be notified when the amount of confirmations have been reached.
Now I use the app Bitcoin Block Notifier but it would be nice if it was implemented in Mycelium.

No, bitcoin will probably keep finding support around this level and move towards $300 again.

It's ridiculous in my eyes to spend $100 to protect $230.

Some people should have this option to report a bug now and then.

This is the app. Just look at the permission of the app, it's safe. And it's installed on my phone for a long time and my coins are still safe.
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:05:49
Me neither. It just looks like some people need to own up to their own actions and responsibilities and not blame some exchange for their losses.
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:45:57
That feels really good.
I respect both sides of the discussion and I think sidechains are the future. They will open the floodgates of innovation, but we need larger blocks to keep fees in check and to create confidence that changes can be made.

Why would they need to justify this? It will either happen or it will not.
@_date: 2015-08-05 06:39:15
Look, of course they're not correlated directly, but they're correlated. Bitcoin is used as money, by me and by many others.
But the price swings wildly and it's hard to say when it's overvalued or undervalued
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:09:28
I love you guys.
If I may make request for an extra function in the app, I think it would be nice to be able to set an alarm for incoming and outgoing transaction after a certain amount of confirmations.

Another factor is spreading risk. Let's say that 20% of my assets are in bitcoin and the price rises tenfold. 
Now more than two thirds of my assets are in bitcoin. To spread my risk I might want to sell a percentage.
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:16:05
Well to be honest. Point 1 is that I'm a long term holder / user of bitcoin.
Point 2 is that I can more relate to people who are enthusiastic about something than people who spend their time hating on something.
Point 3 is that something that grows (arguably the bitcoinnetwork), never goes up in a pretty straight line, it's going to messy, that's inevitable. Why fight something that's inevitable. Same goes for pumpers, if bitcoin is the future ot will get there.

Sound money is vital.
Besides, also in your country the problems will get bigger.
The US economy is in a major bubble and even now the unemployment is high and the economy is in a bad shape.
When the bubble pops people will rush towards sound money. Be the first to recognize the value of bitcoin and be rewarded.
@_date: 2015-07-18 13:59:59
You're strawmanning whole by implying that we're saying that people should buy bitcoins instead.
No, bitcoin should only be used as a store of value for a small percentage of your assets but bitcoin can be used to send money over distances when banks are closed.
BTMs localbitcoins and services like bitreserve and coinapult can be used to exchange bitcoins for other assets.
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:47:01

That's a very one sided view of their problems. Yes, Greece as a whole is insolvent, but this also makes them illiquid. This is where Bitcoin can help.
Greece's exporters can receive bitcoins and Greece's importers can pay foreign trading partners.
This would be a very healthy dynamic: Bitcoins flowing from abroad to exporters, who will sell them to importers, who in turn will send them abroad again.

Markets are not perfect and don't price in everything perfectly. We've had a very hefty bear market so if anything the sentiment is very negative and the price is on the low side.

@_date: 2015-07-04 21:55:59

The earth revolving around the sun used to be a fringe idea. The powers of that time, the church, didn't like that idea. It challenged their power and the idea that god created the earth as the center of the universe.
The powers of this time, the financial elite, don't like the idea of a fixed amount type of money. It challenges their power and the idea that we need an ever greater supply of money comtrolled by them. A fixed supply can perfectly work but interest rates would be lower because demand for borrowing will drop.
