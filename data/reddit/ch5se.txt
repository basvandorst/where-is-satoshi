Universal currency ��‍♂️ I think they’d need internet access first. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:44:50
No? The video makes some pretty valid points, and we don’t technically know who created bitcoin?

Looking in to Coinbase and it seems to have quite a bad rep right now? Any input on this? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:02:06
Also isn’t the goal for bitcoin to be the main currency? Shouldn’t you encourage others to start using it? Looking for reasons I should (or should not) use bitcoin, please inform me.

What is SegWit and why should I use it? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:05:03
Do you have any sources that can help me learn about the technology? I understand the basics but no harm in learning more.

True but we can’t be sure considering his passing and lack of confession beforehand. Anyways, the video is still interesting to think about and is merely food for thought.
