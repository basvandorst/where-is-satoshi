Watching Andreas talk about Bitcoin on the Joe Rogan Experience. Fun stuff. :)

This appears to be a circle of transactions that I could perform:
1. Buy ~$1300 USD worth of gift cards for 1 bitcoin.
2. Resell those gift cards on someplace like Raise for ~$1000 USD.
3. Use that ~$1000 USD to buy ~2.5 BTC, turning a profit of ~1.5 BTC. Repeat steps 1-3.
Just wondering where my gap in understanding is. Sorry if the original post wasn't clear.

Clarifying: I meant buying gift cards with bitcoin, then converting the gift cards to USD, then buying back bitcoin with the USD. I updated the thread.

Oh well, we made it 50% there.

Dude, chill. It's a valid question.

"We"? You don't represent the entire sub.
Edit: For the record, I agree with you, but this kind of language is very groupthink. We aren't homogenous.

Thanks for clarifying, Charlie. :) Agree with Tarindel that it's a very important point.
This somewhat contradicts [Dave's]( and [Rosie's]( comments however, and the Coinbase [cost basis report]( also calculates all transfers as sales/buys.
It'd be great to be more consistent here and just generally assume that transfers are **not** sold off-platform, both in the messaging and reports.

Other commenters covered the answer, but you may also find this site useful: 
Really puts things into perspective, IMO.
Edit: Bah, looks like the site is down, here's an archive:

It's not that large. Most estimates are ~1-3 million, with 1 million only being the "known" lost coins, while 3 million assumes that all coins that haven't moved in several+ years are lost (including Satoshi's stash).
20 million is a nice round coin cap that I usually use.

Love the idea! Here's an idea for a future release: add a tipping feature (via comments?) a la changetip. You already have the bitcoin wallet infra in place.

The general sentiment on this sub is going to be overwhelming positive towards bitcoin. Not to dodge the question, but you're the only one who can decide if it's right for you and how much to invest. I think it has a pretty good risk-reward profile, but it is high risk.
If you're concerned about a price drop you can always dollar cost average (DCA) in. Setting up a daily or weekly purchase is going to be your best bet.

Anyone else see this? Only lasted for a few minutes I think.

Bitcoin isn't mentioned at all. And you made me listen to Trump to 2 minutes - damnit.

Very cool! I've been thinking of renting a rig for a while, mostly just for fun. I'll give betarigs a look!

Scam. Shame that you decry Brainbux for building a scam site then build your own.
