This video.  It's like a British guy narrating an episode of the Walking Dead.  He loves to make assumptions too; that's all he does the entire video.

If the hashrate drops, I'll turn my computer on.  There won't ever be a shortage of miners.  I got the impression from this article that the author hasn't thought through the actual mechanism one would use to crash the price.  I don't think he gets naked shorting at all.  Naked shorting is allowed in stock
 and futures because the system is programmed to allow "market makers" to naked short financial instruments.  Bitcoin has no concept of this.

It is self-correcting, though with Bitcoin, in an extremely short market, I'd worry about the solvency of the exchange whether I was long or short, for whatever exchange allows shorting and has the largest disparity.  Also, naked shorting of bitcoin is impossible; if one doesn't have the bitcoin to sell, the buyer didn't buy a bitcoin.  Most people just aren't trading-savvy.

A financial audit is only in bitstamp's interest if bitstamp can pass the audit.

First, if you aren't on testing or unstable, you didn't upgrade openssl.
Second, try running aptitude.  There is an option in the menus to fix broken packages.
Lastly, you can try "apt-get install -f &lt;package-name&gt;", which will attempt to fix broken packages.
Also, there are plenty of links on internet search for debian package help.
p.s.: I don't fun the full client, so don't know its current state on  Debian.

Some might go so far as to call it a police state.  Like me.

Yeah, Treasury is looking to impose restrictions.  They are not looking to be Bitcoin friendly.

For best long term storage, send the bitcoins to an address, then lose the private key for that address.  Those coins won't go anywhere for a very long time.

Wall St isn't afraid; Bitcoin just isn't on the list of assets the Federal Reserve will purchase with printed money.  Wall St likes games rigged in its favor.

For a good while there was a way to discover lots of Coinbase users, either through the api or via screenname or email.  Don't remember exactly.

Not at Business Insider, it isn't.

The app was a third party app that asks for authorization to access your coinbase account.  Coinbase allows these apps so that companies can integrate with coinbase.
What Coinbase didn't realize is how easy it is to get people to inadvertently allow new apps (which have full access to wallets!), and this is entirely Coinbase's fault.  All that malicious email needed was a link; no one who clicked it knew they were authorizing anything.
So while the malicious app may have stolen some coins, this is a Coinbase API failure.
