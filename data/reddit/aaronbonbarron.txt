Hey same! I paid $90-ish AUD for my first 1.3BTC, too bad I didn't know what I was doing and put it in some dodgy "wallet" recommended by the TOR Hidden Wiki.
Protip: everything on the hidden wiki is a scam

In Australia we have something called OSKO that allows instant bank transfers, it seems like the banks are playing catch up finally.

Doge is superior, BCH is just boneless BTC

Powered by Australia's very own shitcoin lmao

I was in Japan early last year and didn't find anywhere obvious to spend btc, even in akihabara.
Everything is cash cash cash.
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:51:22
You mean like doge?
@_date: 2019-04-07 14:54:16
Japan has a very honest and respectful culture, this isn't America.

I bought 1.3BTC when it was about $70USD, got scammed by some dodgy TOR "wallet" recommended by the Hidden Wiki, didn't touch it again until last year.  
Feels bad man.

I was there last April, saw plenty of these ads but nowhere advertised that they accepted crypto.
I cashed out my LTC on BTCMarkets and pulled it out at a 7/11 instead.

My first boss did this. If we didn't work 30mins or more past knock off we were told not to write it down, and if we did he would cross it out and write normal time.  
We were also frequently pulled off of lunch to do jobs he had booked in last minute, and made to stay back to do jobs that turned up literally 5 minutes before the end of the day.  
I didn't realise what a dodgy cunt he was until I got my second job and it felt like they were paid to be nice to me.

The problem is it's powered by a scam named Auscoin.

Well that's fucking dumb as hell. You shouldn't touch your phone at all while driving, especially with passengers.
