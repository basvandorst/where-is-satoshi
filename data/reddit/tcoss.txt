I like this a great deal.  In explaining things to new users, it's not worthy always being handicapped by fractional math.  As the price grows, this problem compounds (pun intended).  Excellent thinking, Jimmy.

In 1998 I asked a friend of mine, an attorney for CBS Records, what CBS thought of MP3 file's. He said that they were aware of the technology and they (CBS Records) don't see it as any kind of threat to their business.  Hmm.
Woe to the comfortable, even banks.

Anyone interested in us BTC users? I have no theologic position other than bitcoin working, or perhaps it is that we're not all that important?

Great pick-up! Outstanding job.  So gentlemen we have a mystery in front of us from which new learning will come along with greater confidence that we know what we're doing.

Does it matter if it's at the block level or individual transaction level?

Faith in the Bitcoin network belongs TO the network, we all own this one. This begins with showing respect to Mr. Hearn followed by proving him wrong.

The US has been doing Capitalism for over 300 years, China for about 30 years, so like any newbie, they tend to over react.  They'll pull it together, but it will take some time, and this is just on example adaptation. 
Bitcoin is like picking up mercury with your fingers.
