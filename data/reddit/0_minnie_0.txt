Sounds like an interesting project. You may be interested to hear what Counterparty is trying to do (providing trustless, decentralized bets on feeds -- anything from coin prices, to weather conditions, to Super Bowl results.) Funding can also be achieved through issuance of assets, which represent shareholder interest. Alternative approaches are definitely welcome though; so far bitcoin lacks a truly robust derivatives market.

For me it's a very simple matter. Nation-state fiat scrip is a giant scam, all of it is eventually worthless after X # of decades. Even nations with the BEST of intentions (few and far between) cannot help but inflate their currency, eroding its value.
From a financial perspective: All empires crumble into the dust of history, eventually. Which means sooner or later your descendants will be left holding the bag of that worthless inheritance you left them. Bitcoin is the opposite, it can only gain value over time.
From an ethical perspective: Nations require violence to keep their currencies valuable, bitcoin does not.

Who cares what he thinks?  The senior very likely has no idea what bitcoin even is, and likely just figured out how to use email for the first time.
They can keep there massive semi-existent funny-money fiat. In fact I'd prefer if they don't buy any bitcoin at all.

Amazing that something that is neither a "good" nor a "service" attracts GST - you certainly can't imagine the Australian government getting away with applying this approach to "stocks" (I can understand GST applying to "fees and commissions" but not to the BTC itself).

You could hold up a "challenge" for cracking our app which contains wallet which contains 1 BTC coin for example, and the 1st who is going to crack it, the 1 BTC is all him.

Relative stability of Bitcoin vs several commodity prices (i.e. Oil, Gold and silver, etc) will probably occur naturally in the near to medium-term future. Fiat inflation will give us the illusion of higher BTC prices, but our real wealth will be fairly stable since the cost of living is so much higher every year.
During the early years BTC prices have dramatically outperformed gold, but that trend might slow down until stable. 
Bitcoin still provides a current chance to do much better than gold. Given a clear choice many people will not actually want anything too "stable".

Worst advice on this thread.
Most people lose out investing in altcoin over the long term. Only take 1-2 scams to lose most of your bitcoin holding.

Well, you would need to explain what bitcoins were to the manager, and find some way to convince them they are actually worth something, and that this isn't just a scam. Good luck teaching the technologically impaired about Bitcoins.

I believe that coinbase actually offers a similar service to what you are describing. I think it is something along the lines of buy and refill (?) 
Also coinbase does try to make holding your bitcoin with them very user friendly while making it difficult for others to steal from you via your coinbase account

I don't have a problem with merchants selling the bitcoin for fiat once they received it. They need to pay manufacturers in fiat, so they need to convert the bitcoin. Once bitcoin gets popular, manufacturers may accept bitcoins too. I think "millions" is exaggerated, thousands may be more realistic.

When does ANY exchange insure lost bitcoins for an individual's own negligence? If they do insure these types of lost btc, then it's open for a lot of abuse. It's the equivalent of a chargeback.

Yeah, you could include the proper format for the answers with the questions.  Something like, "What was the color, year, make, and model of the automobile dad used to keep in the garage? (colorYYYYMakeModel)"  with the correct response being "red1965ChevroletCamaro"

The next time someone shows a chart with a pool at 50% it would be interesting to see what the 7 day chart shows. As you say, if ghash did something untoward, the backlash from their 180,000+ miners would cost them more than they could ever gain from it. 
My biggest concern is corporate miners. As they grow in size and number they may not have bitcoin's best interests at the top of their list, and collusion is not below their standards if there is a buck in it. Any public backlash would have little effect on their operations, beyond a flood of phone calls, twitters, and emails that they would ignore. At this point in time they aren't a threat... but keep a close watch in the future. I feel, if there ever is a real threat, that is where it will come from.
