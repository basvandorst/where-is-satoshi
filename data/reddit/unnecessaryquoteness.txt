The safe withdrawal rate on 2 million would yield 80k a year, inflation adjusted, for 30 years (at a 98% predicted success rate).  If you can live on 60k then that timeframe becomes more like 50 years with a 95% confidence. The average person could certainly live on that.
That's assuming that you cash the BTC out and put it into the stock market.

No.  Assuming you are in the US, the IRS treats cryptocurrency as a capital asset so you pay capital gains tax only when you sell - similar to a stock holding.

I sell a few different types of filament on my website - [extrudables.us]( - and I accept bitcoin, but have yet to make any sales in BTC.  I'm just getting off the ground so it may just be a matter of exposure (or lack of).   So, I guess that doesn't really answer your question.  Sorry.

It's my opinion that anyone would be foolish to speculate / invest 100% in any single thing, whether it's bitcoin or real estate or whatever. You're free to disagree of course.
@_date: 2017-02-07 14:55:09
And if (s)he ever wants to move out then gambling 100% of life savings on bitcoin lottery tickets may not be the best choice. 
BTC isn't even an investment at this point, it's a speculation.  One that I'm bullish on, but still. A young person just getting their feet on the ground would be well served to understand diversification and personal finance *before* putting everything they have in this.  
@_date: 2017-02-07 14:56:35
It's 100% of their savings. It's risky whether it's 600 or 600,000.
@_date: 2017-02-07 23:17:37
None, but 2010 me couldn't think of any reasons it would go to $1000 either, so I may not be the best person to ask.  
Maybe "all value" was the wrong choice of words.  Let's say "a lot of value" instead.  Just look at 2014 for an example.

This is going to get down voted to hell, but you should not have your entire life savings in bitcoin.  Only put in money that you can afford to spend (lose). BTC may have a very promising future but it's still really early in the game and nobody knows for sure what will happen.  The chances that it will burn out and lose all value are slim, but not zero.
If you don't make very much money you would be well served by making, and sticking to, a budget.  Check out Your budget should include putting  some money in a more traditional savings area (cash under your mattress, in a bank or in a safe investment).  Then if you can afford it you can add a line item in your budget for bitcoin under the entertainment category.

A lot more people are trying to "mine" bitcoin today, compared to 2014.  The more competition there is, the harder the problem becomes - this is a difficulty adjustment that is built-in to bitcoin.  Today it is no longer profitable to mine bitcoin using a regular desktop consumer computer once you factor in the cost of electricity.


Because of the above, some smart folks designed &amp; built dedicated chips (ASICs) that are specifically optimized to solve the type of math problems required to mine bitcoin.  They run much more efficiently than a general-purpose computer and therefore are profitable, although usually only in locations where electricity is very cheap such as in China and other parts of Asia.

General rule of thumb is that your panels lose 1% efficiency per year. So after 20 years they will be around 80% of rated output.

The stock market provides us almost 200 years of history showing that, over the long run, investments tend to rise in value.
Bitcoin has 4 years of history showing that investments in it tend to rise in value, but there is no long-term knowledge of how it will behave. This is like investing in a startup with a highly volatile and unpredictable track record.
In your mid-30s with a steady, high-paying job you should be contributing aggressively to your 401k.  If you have 100k socked away now you're probably already behind and should be thinking about increasing your contributions.  If you retire at 70 (!) you may well live another 20 or 30 years. Cost-of-living and medical expenses will continue to rise.  You will most likely need a lot more money in retirement than you think.
Buy bitcoin with disposable income, not your 401k. If you hit the jackpot, you can retire early.  If not, then at least you haven't jeopardized your only hope of retiring at all.
