They saved you from losing all your money. You should be bringing them donuts.

I wouldn't say KYC is a fraud, its just dumb and easily manipulated. It works as a deterrent, but fails logistically across the board.

If you ever watched the Paypal CEO on CNBC you'd know this right away. The dude is very outspoken about BTC and calls it a fraud all the time. He is also one of the biggest pompous aholes Ive witnessed on the show. His arrogance just bleeds through. Even worse than Mr. DIMON

Just wait till the dip is so big it crushes your soul. You haven't been truly living yet till you feel that pain.

I've been in BTC while you were jerking off to posts on reddit in grade school. Get a life and stop playing the internet tough guy bc we all know in reality your some chump. Bc you've never been down I dont know how BTC works. LOL sell me some of the shit you're on. Psychopath. You made my day though and I applaud you for that.

Definitely do your own thinking. Bag holders will talk about buying a dip till they are blue in the face. Newbs always talk about buying dips too bc they have never been crushed to death and want to be part of the "in" crowd. I've been in this game a long time, just be smart with your money. If you turn BTC into casino chips then you will end up just like the people at the blackjack table. Lonely and broke.

Damn how much you down? Aggressive and a stalker. You're going places and I can definitely tell your future is secured. HAHAHAHAH To think the OP can handle the swings of BTC when he cant even handle a bank not accepting his transaction and has to make a post about it was the intent of my post MR. Wiseguy. Now stay off my page you creep.

Only if this could be plastered all over NY and when taken down be put right back up. I bet the person who gets caught orchestrating something like this would be locked up or killed within 2 days. Its amazing people don't do more settle acts against the evil corps of the world. We are all truly scared about our well being when these titans want something done. We are no different than Russia. Probably should be on a VPN with this post... pray for me.
