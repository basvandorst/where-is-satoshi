You can always invest in the stock market - download Robinhood and start researching companies you think will do well in the future. Or buy broad market ETFs and dollar cost average for that boring but effective money printer. 
Crypto is basically gambling. Nobody really knows where bitcoin is going. If you put 7k into bitcoin, you might end up with 10k or 2k in a month. Last few times bitcoin has corrected over 80% down from its local high. You are playing in a market that's unregulated and full of potential pump and dump schemes. You also need to consider the time necessary to make deposits and get coins transferred (and fees).
If you want to be a property investor, I'd recommend putting 80% into a long term stock account, and 20% into crypto. Putting 100% into bitcoin at these prices is a ton of risk. The fact that you are asking if you should do it shows me that you are probably not ready for that much risk.

Sounds like you are thinking about these problems in a useful way! I have no idea how old you are, but if you haven't been to college yet I'd encourage you to give economics a shot. As someone with a few degrees I can certainly recommend it - great blend of math and theory.
You idea about loans backed by bitcoin is neat, however there are a few things that need to be considered. First is that loans denominated in bitcoin are going to be very hard to write given the volatility of the underlying asset. Banks need to know that the loans they write aren't going to be worthless or extremely expensive for them in one month.. Without a healthy forwards market there's almost no way to get risk down to an acceptable level. Banks *require* predictable risk models otherwise they will get crushed. Therefore ultimately it doesn't matter if bitcoin can't be printed, it's not predictable enough to be used as a basis for lending. 
As for your second question, it's undeniably worse to have a shrinking economy (aka a depression) than an economy where consumers take more risks and consume more products. While I 100% agree that consumer culture is out of control, the alternative is mass unemployment since people stop buying things (and therefore the companies who make things lose revenue, and have to layoff employees). Think about the effects of the most recent recession on this country, and the mental state of the millions of people who lost their jobs. It's a really dangerous thing to intentionally slow down an economy. You'll end up with a mob of angry, unemployed laborers at the gates of your bitcoin neighborhood, and it probably won't end well. 
In summation, these are all great questions to think about, but they've already been researched and studied extensively by economists throughout the past few centuries. The hubris of the bitcoin world is that many people think that basic economic rules no longer apply. I'd be happy to provide more information and sources if you'd like to learn more!

I understand the arguments for decentralization and, while I have issues with it, I don’t think that’s what I’m criticizing. My issue is that Bitcoin is designed to be deflationary, which makes it impossible for organizing economic activity. It’s also going to be too slow to be used on a global scale. It’s possible that in the future, a better version of bitcoin will come along and solve these problems, but until then it’s quite literally impossible for businesses to invest and buy things when they (by design) will receive better returns by simply holding bitcoin. While inflation hurts savers, deflation destroys nations faster than bombs. If you would like to know why, [here's a quick intro on the dangers of deflation.](
You might respond that once everything is denominated in bitcoin, it won’t be deflationary, but that’s still incorrect given that there’s a limited supply (21M). It’s a first-mover problem given that nobody wants to spend bitcoin, and everyone ends up hording it, creating a deflationary spiral. 
 
This whole manifesto about who holds the power and why “the bankers” don’t want to share it is nice, but it ultimately does not address the problem of debt as the chief driver of economic growth. Without being able to take on debt in the form of loans, nobody except for the very wealthy can afford to create businesses. 
The Bitcoin future without fractional reserve lending or the ability to create loans would look a lot like the early, pre-Renaissance banking system in Europe where interest was not allowed and everyone was essentially either a serf or a member of nobility. In the Bitcoinization future you are picturing, you’d be the nobility and everyone else would essentially be a serf, begging for a piece of your bitcoins since there’s no way for them to receive loans from any of these pesky banks. Forgive me if I'm unconvinced that that's the optimal outcome for society at large.

Except that bitcoin has a global limit of about 4-7 transactions per second, for everyone to share. It will never take over the world given that simple limitation. There are currently **1,970** credit card transactions *every second* using VISA and Mastercard. The total number of transactions is much higher per second using all fiat currencies. 
Bitcoinization or whatever you want to call it will *never* be possible due to limitations in the core code. Perhaps some other crypto can solve this in the future, but bitcoin will never be the one. 
Downvote me if you want, it doesn't change the cold, hard facts.

I mostly agree with your sentiments here. I think the question about whether bitcoin is predictably deflationary is fine in pure theory, however in practice bitcoin has exploded in value compared to the cost of inputs in the real economy. Therefore it's essentially useless as a currency in the real world as we've seen. I just don't see that changing in any meaningful way in the future.

There's incredible technological progress being made every year in terms of speeding up financial networks and payment technology. These advances generally come from these things called banks, which manage trillions of dollars and can pay millions for R&amp;D to create tech solutions. If they think there's something to bitcoin, they would have already implemented it. Instead, they realized quickly that decentralized networks with strong encryption is a recipe for disaster in terms of both transaction speeds and losing wallets due to losing keys. 
Unfortunately, it's entirely possible that decentralized money is a non-starter as a store of value and a medium of exchange. Any economist will tell you this, but bitcoin wasn't created by economists.
It's simple hubris to assume that computer scientists somehow created a better currency than economists and finance experts who devoted their lives to creating our current monetary models and theory.
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:12:43
Congratulations! You've uncovered one of the fundamental, unsolvable problems with decentralized currency. Without a central stabilization mechanism, the value fluctuates far too much for the currency to be used daily. Any solution requires centralized intervention.
The reason is that bitcoin derives 100% value via seigniorage. Seigniorage is the fancy name for the profit made on the difference between the face value of the currency and the cost to create the currency. The act of creating currency (aka mining bitcoin) makes you money. Imagine if everyone in the US was able to print out their own dollars from a home printer, although each dollar printed slowed down the rate of each subsequent dollar being printed. Since it would be decentralized, everyone would scramble to print as much as possible all at once, until it would be too slow to effectively print more at home. Then you'd need to start trading other things in order to get dollars, which would increase the demand (and value) of the existing circulation of dollars. This is called deflation, and if this sounds to you like a bad idea for creating a currency, you'd be right. That's why bitcoin will never be used as a currency. It's a vehicle for financial speculation.

The government doesn't print money in the way you think they do - it's just a figure of speech. The US government issuing more debt does not increase inflation,. The US government could buy 51% of all bitcoin tomorrow and destroy it if they wanted, and the value of the dollar wouldn't budge. Same thing if the government bought ten new aircraft carriers tomorrow. Inflation is measured based on *prices* of goods and services, which are already denominated in dollars.

Buying and selling bitcoin using fiat (investment activities) is a different scenario than what you just quoted, which pertains to using bitcoin as a medium of exchange. You don't need to pay taxes on a transaction when you pay for your groceries, for example. If you pay for a burger using bitcoin, that also doesn't need to be taxed. It's when you use dollars to buy bitcoin, hold, and then sell for a profit that bitcoin is treated like a commodity.
Small distinction, but the people who write these releases and regulate the financial world make their living on these sorts of small distinctions. I'm sure that you can understand.

Come on dude, if you are at all versed in economics you'll know that bitcoin is pure snake oil. I'm surprised that you haven't sold it yet.

That's why it's basically only used to buy drugs online, which is its only advantage over fiat right now.

I'm really curious why you think he's incorrect? Bitcoin is just that: a very fast money order. You can't use it as a currency outside of a few edge cases, and ultimately it's just a way to move fiat around the world quickly.
Vodafone has a much faster currency called m-pesa which is technically superior to bitcoin, and is used tens of thousands of times daily for routine transactions.

Should be the biggest story today, but I highly doubt it'll make it to the front page of this sub. News that the SEC is officially treating bitcoin as a security brings far-reaching implications to the community, not the least being that running pump and dump schemes for ICOs is now illegal under US federal law.
Additionally, it allows the IRS to easily go after anyone who has sold a security (bitcoin) without paying capital gains taxes. This isn't a case where you can easily avoid detection because "it's internet money", your bank reports your accounts to the IRS and you'll find yourself under audit if money appears in your account without explanation. Quick reminder that tax evasion is a felony. You'll be fine if you keep a paper wallet since that's considered "unrealized" gains (or losses).

While I'm sure that you'll be accused of spreading FUD, the smarter lurkers here should absolutely take heed of this fundamental problem with the exchanges. There's a reason they always "break" when volumes spike.. It's because they can't afford to process all your trades fairly.
It's likely they've created a secondary market internally (a dark pool) where they can match trades without exchanging bitcoin, and then they clear them later when the dust settles.

Controlled inflation is healthy because it incentivizes people and companies to invest their cash instead of burying it in their backyard, which allows businesses to grow, banks to loan, people to buy cars and houses, and generally create economic growth. 2% per year is the standard target, although we've been below that recently.
Bitcoin is deflationary, which means that burying it in your backyard will make you wealthier over time. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that if everyone holds their money instead of spending it, businesses close, people lose their jobs, loans dry up, and eventually the internet turns off because nobody is paying for it.
It's been obvious from the start that bitcoin is a really bad currency for exchange. People trading it should think of it as a commodity instead. All these fever dreams about taking over the fiat regimes are honestly hilarious and sad because some people are actually serious about it becoming a global currency.

Let's be honest, bitcoin is perhaps the dumbest use of electricity I can think of. When it first came out in 2011 ish, I thought it was dumb but I understood it had uses on dark web markets. Now it's definitely not useful for that either, but the combination of brand name recognition to bring in dumb money, early adopters with 100s of easily mined throwing everything they can into becoming bitcoin evangelicals online, and techno-libertarians (aka CS grads) completely misunderstanding how central banking works built a perfect maelstrom of ignorance.

Derivative contracts based on an underlying asset (in this case, bitcoin).
Think of bitcoin as a horse race. You can buy a horse and race it around the track right now, and that's about it. Futures allow spectators to now place bets between themselves on what horse is going to win, without having to own a horse themselves.
This means that some of the institutions who currently hold a ton of bitcoin can place a side bet on the futures market that bitcoin will be, say under $800 in 20 days. Then, in the actual bitcoin market they sell off all their bitcoins and cause the market to crater. This is market manipulation in almost every instance, but since bitcoin is proudly unregulated, there's no ability to stop this behavior.
The futures markets do not crash at all if bitcoin crashes, since they are just spectators. All open positions are countered by the opposite bet, and closed on expiration (or if you sell your own side of the contract, but don't worry about that).
I'd suggest you read up a bit on finance - it's about to become important to bitcoin.

The [FDIC insures all personal accounts]( up to 250,000 USD - you'll be fine.

Fiat is protected from bank runs by the FDIC, then land and laws, and ultimately weapons. Ain't nobody bailing out bitcoin investors when the music stops.

Sure but during a panic they have to settle instantly in order to make the market, which isn't really possible with current banking tech. This could easily dry out their "float" reserve and create a real mess.

Can I give you a few reasons why I still don't want to touch bitcoin? 
1) It's a commodity, not a currency, and therefore anything that depends on converting to/from Bitcoin is subject to rapid changes in value. This makes any sort of accounting impossible, thus making it useless for business. Since a huge amount of transactions are done B2B, it's missing a huge growth vector. I know that most of you all don't care about GAP principles, but it's a very real roadblock to future use cases. You would need a *very* healthy futures exchange to start to fix this issue. 
2) Massive issue with credit liquidity in the event of a "bank rush". The reason is that the main exchanges that convert bitcoin to fiat do not have any sort of reserve requirements, and are completely out of luck in the event of a rush &gt; 10% of total assets. Given the long time it currently takes to clear a transaction, a legit panic could occur and you'd see a very serious (50-90%) fall in the price as everyone races for the doors, only to find that there's no fiat in the exchanges. Fractional reserve banking relies on a healthy FX market and sovereign intervention to keep things stable.. trying to run a fractional reserve system with a commodity like bitcoin as one of your currency pairs is absolutely suicidal. It's only working now because everyone is pumping money into the system, but it'll get bad when the music stops. 
3) Unregulated exchanges and the opening derivative markets will certainly allow a practice called front-running. This is highly illegal in fiat markets (for good reason). What happens is the exchange itself starts doing this thing where it receives a large order, sees that this order will boost the price, and therefore places its own order right before processing the large order. This gives them an instantaneous, risk-free profit as the larger order boosts the price up. There are absolutely no checks on this type of behavior and no real way for users to know whether this is occurring, and it's likely already happening. Blows to the credibility of major exchanges hurt the value (Mt. Gox). 
4) High possibility of regulatory action from governments worldwide given the ability of bitcoin to fund terrorism and rogue regimes. When this occurs, all institutional investors will have to pull money, and the IRS will definitely start tracking individuals that wake up one day with 100,000 in fiat and can't explain where it came from. Therefore it'll be easier than people think to ban it.
I could continue with a few more core issues, but these are the main things that pose major downside risks for bitcoin IMO. If you got in early, you deserve the credit for holding out this long.

Hey look! Someone who actually knows what they are talking about!
It's adorable when the kids here get defensive about the idea that banks are crushing their dreams.
Guess what? If bitcoin was truly the future of money, guess who would be buying all the bitcoin available? Yes, banks!

Wow that's awesome; my model has it dropping to $4096.78 in a week.

Explain to me how bitcoin is getting around the global transaction limit.
Nobody has been able to explain a workaround. Therefore, it's not fud, it's cold reality that everyone conveniently ignores.

I went to a top program and have a degree in economics. It's nearly impossible to independently verify large macro level behavior without resources to run large natural experiments. The Austrians arguably haven't been able to prove their theories outside of the chalkboards, whereas folks at central banks around the world have actually been given the opportunity to test which types of monetary policy stimulates the economy most effectively in order to 1) prevent deflation and hyperinflation, and 2) maintain optimal employment rates. If there was a better system out there, it would already be adopted, especially given the amount of noise that the Austrians make. 
Bitcoin has neither of these concerns, which is why it whipsaws wildly in price. It's core principle is to reward early adopters in order to spread and gain more miners. It's not a store of value, and it's not a good medium of exchange compared to something like the M-PESA (which is actual digital currency). As an early adopter you were rewarded mightily for your efforts to spread the word about bitcoin. Now, after everyone and their mom has heard about it, we see the inevitable decline in price as fewer people are brought into the bitcoin world.

Yeah, let's just handwave away the idea of a 2% target because who really knows if those clowns at the Fed know what they are doing. It's not like they manage multiple *trillions* of dollars in assets and have hundreds of PhDs conducting research on monetary policy. Oh wait.
But hey, I guess that *you have a hunch* that 2% isn't optimal so yeah, let's just go with that instead.
You aren't an expert. Janet Yellen is an expert. I know who I'm trusting.

Aka you now understand what economists have said all along.
Next up: why building a currency around the idea of shrinking supply is a perfect storm for hoarding and destroying any form of credit liquidity, thus making it solely useful for speculation and never for commerce. Tune in next time!

There's this global communication network called SWIFT that handles billions of FX volume daily... Turns out people figured out how to do it over 40 years ago.

From the Lightning Network white paper:


Despite the fact that LN is just a clearinghouse where parties agree to settle the full amount later, there's *still* a huge roadblock given that the most optimistic case requires bitcoin to hard fork up from 1mb to 133mb and that everyone caries around over 2TB just to store the "pruned" blockchain.
Perfect information across all nodes comes at the price of speed and size. Unless we use some variant of quantum entanglement to break the current laws of physics, it's just not feasible to build a perfectly uniform, instant, omniscient network. 
With centralized networks, only one node needs to be fast enough to store and accept new information, while all other devices can be trivially underpowered. This is how VISA can process 45,000 swipes per second.

Just remember that it takes a lot more than a 50% gain to offset a 50% loss. Volatility is a killer for passive investments.
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:30:17
Unless they solve the global transaction rate limit (6-8 per second) there's absolutely no hope for bitcoin to take over the world.
At that point there will be a massive quantum attack and everyone loses everything once wallets cannot be secured.
Bitcoin will never, ever reach those levels.

Not sarcastic! If you are interested in international finance, this book is super readable and goes through a lot of the history behind why we have currency, insurance, bonds, options, and all sorts of fun financial instruments. The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World
 
Really like where your head is at - always pays to be skeptical as an entrepreneur. I'm bearish on bitcoin but I like to hang out here to see if there are any interesting projects or opportunities in the crypto space.
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:44:11
Nah dude you totally get it - it's a really stupid idea to use decentralized ledgers as a basis for rapid credit transactions. It's never going to be fast enough to work in our actual world. Maybe for something like tracking real estate ownership or property rights or expensive art, but not for money.
If you are interested in seeing an actual digital currency that is used by millions daily, check out the M-PESA.

You are only looking at the supply side of currencies.
The only thing that moves prices is demand + supply. Prices can fall even if the supply falls, because demand can fall even harder.
I know this is econ 101 (literally like the first chapter), but I have a feeling that most people on this sub never got that far into the dirty fiat sciences.

It's pretty obvious what's happening right now with the prices. The overall trend is downward, and people want out. There are a few market manipulators with 100+ bitcoin that just sit around, wait for a steady downward 15 min trend to open up, then they buy 50-100 btc (which is enough to swing the price up a few hundred), then they sell gradually over the next few minutes. It's guaranteed profit given that the price is in a steady downward trend with low volume.
