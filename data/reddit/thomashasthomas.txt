thanks, but is there some way how to see it directly in tradingview (with my time frame selection (not just 4 hour) etc...?
I tried typing BTCUSDSHORTS+BTCUSDLONGS 
And they work like mathematic operation.... but im not able to see both of them at the same graph...
I tried typing
&amp; as the "operation" but it doesnt work...
How to get it?
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:24:04
you mean like noobs now expecting it (price) to go up.... a little more experienced people see a high ammount of leverage shorts, thus expecting a fuckery - short squuze...? But even more experienced people see that less experienced people are expecting a fuckery (short squeeze), so they double fuck them and there wont be any short squeeze :-)...? do i get it righ? So its a fuckery of an (expected) fuckery...? 
( so the ultimate noobs who dont know about anything of this might be the most correct :-)? )
@_date: 2018-08-26 13:17:26
Yes, that helped, thank you :-)!
Well the shorts are really HIGH :-)... it looks like a short squeeze incomming, any opinion on this?
@_date: 2018-08-26 13:10:15
Oh thank you, that looks like it should help, will try, thanks.

Some replies here are dumb, sorry guys. I did not ask you if you should store your BTC on exchange. I asked about the new  Terms of Use and Privacy Policy... Does anybody here know something about that?
Also Bitstamp curiously (i did not expect that) have NOT good reviews... (here: [ )
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:41:57
Welll... they dont have that good of reviews here...
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:43:59
Thanks, thats a good idea but its not really useable for many people... i really need paypal FIAT to my BTC adress, credit card FIAT to my BTC adress, Wire transfer FIAT to my BTC adress etc.
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:09:20


Thanks, found it, will look into it.
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:00:38
It IS for me... and i logged to bistamp last time like maybe only few weeks ago... and than today again. So yeah... its NEW:..
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:17:35
I hope you mean this irronicaly...
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:01:47


Oh... so they actuallly HELD your coins hostage !?!?
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:47:01
OP here. I dont intend at this point in time in answering these stupid question. I checked my account and it still says "verified". I do not want to contact them in order not to shine more light to myself and try to prolong as much as possible filling in that PERSONAL UNNECESSARY info.
My question is: How will this affect my account (somebody who experienced it in the past, can you answer these questions please...?)
1) Will it affect DEPOSITING   FIAT into bitstamp if i dont fill in the info?
2) Will it affect DEPOSITING   CRYPTO (BTC) into bitstamp if i dont fill in the info?
3) Will it affect withdrawing   CRYPTO (BTC)  from bitstamp if i dont fill in the info?
(Im sure it should mainly influence (prevent) withdrawing FIAT from bitstamp and there could be a problem, but since i dont intend to withdraw any FIAT from Bitstamp in years to come i dont care about this much at this point, but im deffinitelly planning depositing and withdrawing Crypto and depositing additional fiat (to buy BTC). Will this affect it?

None of my Banks in one particular EU country have EVER asked me any of these questions... LOL... not even my tax form asks in this detail (your monthly/yearly income, your TOTAL WEALTH... - LOL).
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:05:47


So is it 100% sure that its because of some law in EU and not "private" issue of only Bitstamp...?
Is there any timetable /timeframe when this   AMLD5  will be transposed to the laws of each country...?
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:15:01
Including question on your yeartly income, source of income and your total Net Worth...?
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:59:23


I got the same impression but not sure...
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:55:27
Interesting... i tried to acces my "withrdrawl" and "Deposits" "windows" in bitstamp user interface and when i click either of them, a small popup window appears informing me that i have fill in the form, but if i close the small pop up window, it allows me to acces the withdrawl/deposits pages normally... altough i dont know if an actuall withdrawl or deposits woulkd go through at this point...
ALSO are the question "legally" binding? Because i dont deffinitelly do NOT intend telling them what my NET worth is... Im not happy with either of the questions but this is the critical one in which they can fock off. What could happen if in the net worth i select the "lowest" option? (i think its below 10 000 USD...)...?
BTW they even specifically say in the '"help section" above this question that you should include BOTH your financial and non-financial information (minus liabilities i think) - LOL... like do you want to know my penis size also?
So are the questions suppose to be legally binding or can i lie at least in the net worth section and select the smallest option?
@_date: 2019-12-01 15:48:15
No some posts here ARE stupid (the 1st two...) but you have point, in place with a lot of dumb people you simply have to do all yourself. Cause you cannot trust idio\*s :-(.
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:13:56


didnt received them not only ONCE... just now.. and i sent small ammount of money to the exchange like few weeks ago, loggin to check it back then, didnt see anything, NOW i do...
@_date: 2019-02-24 17:01:08
Also, does anybody know about any other REPUTABLE exchange that does not require this bullshi\*, at least not in this depth (my personal Net worth - fock you),  that accepts european customers...?
Also why do some people downvote this post? Bistamp employes in full force :-)?
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:52:15
short answer - everybody
@_date: 2019-04-28 17:16:14
Thanks, i have never heart the term '"paper trading" in this regard, only demo or some others which i dont remember.
Yeah, i wont do leverage at all. I actually found out about the bitmex demo account myself, so as few others. I dont really like bitmex that much, seems to much "complicated" for me, i was looking for much simple and clean UI like bitstamp has for example (i wont need leverage at all).
Also found out about whalepool but that seems a bit "scamy", wont even register there .
Found out about hitbtc also.
Im quite suprised there arent more options for these "demo account trading" purpose. I thought there will be a TONE. Doesnt seem so.
Isnt there any service like [
that offers this functionality (demo account trading) "platform agnostic" - that means i can choose which exchange to follow for price...? I need only simple operations - buy BTC and Sell BTC, i dont need leverage, heck i dont even need any stop loss. I could do this even by hand on a piece of paper or in excel, but i want some easy place with history....
It seems hard to believe nobody programmed such website yet... you have all kinds of sh\*\* crypto niceh stupidities but not this simple thing :-)? Come on programmers, give it to us :-).
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:59:04
Well... i did NOT ask anything to which your question would be relevant... :-( (?)
@_date: 2019-04-29 14:37:46
sure yeah
@_date: 2019-04-28 17:06:32
Lol, no actually i did NOT.
BTW dont assume anything, things you wrote are laughable.
@_date: 2018-11-05 15:27:24
Yeah... that was exactly my idea... it would be fucking scarry and a lot of pople would get a BIG suprise... since im not sure many realize this upcomming possibility (especially in this day and age when we didnt have an economic crisis for like 10 years, so its safe to expect smht is comming :-) ).
AND especially in the eurozone, which Bitstamp banks are a part of AFAIK....
It would be scarry and funny if one of the safest, oldest, most reliable BTC exchange (bitstamp) would come down NOT because of BTC lost due to hack but because of FIAT lost due to bank collapse :-D....
@_date: 2018-11-05 15:23:20
yes there will be, dont be naive doom gloom repeater.
@_date: 2018-11-01 19:43:52
Imagine Bitstamp having a main bank in Spain or Itally or Greece... (which i dont think they have, altough you cant find probably how much safe is even the major bank of bistamp - e.g. if it is not invested in greece or italy or spain...).
Or even worse... imagine bitstamp having bank in Cyprus in 2013.... Uff... fiat confiscation anyone :-D? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:32:55
yeah it seems that way... i check that fucker again:
and hee seems to be shilling smt in his signature images.
But why my account? BTC talk was hacked in 2015... my account was stolen 3 years later... (in 2018)... like WTF...?
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:38:44
Wow... i didnt know that... I definitelly searched for smt. on google reagrding bitcointalk and might have gone tro the stupid  [bitcointalk.TO]( site by accident...
but my password was stored in my browser... i didnt type it (i think)... would a  bitcointalk.to site would be able to prompt my browser to automatically fill in the login and and pass from [bitcointalk.]( ?
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:04:12
I dont even know what merit is... :-)... The accoutn currently has some (around 200? i dont know), but im not sure if it was aquired (gained) by me or by that hacker....
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:34:17
Are you being sarcastic...? :-)? Im not a native english speaker, so im not sure if you are making just fun of me with your comment, or you are serious...?
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:30:53
I dont think thats necessary (changing all my paswords), to change email associated with my BTC talk account he just needed to acces the account on BTC talk... he didnt hacked my email... what do you mean?
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:43:30
Well i thought so too... but evidently not. They DO sent an email, but the email only states "Your email adress in your account on BTC talk was changed, if you do not agree, click here." (if you dont click in 14 days, the change will go through),... and i was NOT on that email for like 2 months... so the "roll back period" expired and the email was changed... Im not sure why they do it this stupid way :-(...
@_date: 2018-07-17 11:01:11
Also, why the f\*ck doesnt changing of your default email adres registered/adresses on bitcointalk forum require, when changing it on account settings on bitcointalk forum. Why doesnt it require you to actually CLICK on some link they sent you on your "old" email adress... Like that you have to ACTUALLY click in your email on a link to actually APPROVE the changing of yoru adress!!?!? LIke WTF... you have to do it if you want to change your password!!! But not email...!? If you want to change your email you do NOT have to confirm your change by a click. It only informs you an gives you a "passive" link to click if you do not aprove of the change... BUT if you do not click it, it goes through (the change)... So if you do not check your (in my case secondary) email adress periodically it just goes through... LIKE WTF!?!?
@_date: 2018-12-24 23:19:40
thanks will check them out, any other suggestions from anyone else?
