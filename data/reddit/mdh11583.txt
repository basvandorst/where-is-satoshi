The government  will print more money and socialize the losses.  
Hopefully some folks will realize that’s bullshit and hop on the btc train.

You should go back and make one that says things like “immutable” “decentralized” “only 21 million will ever exist”

Well that’s not accurate at all. The government heavily regulates finance and banking.
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:49:38
I’m genuinely curious. If btc replaces fiat in a few years, what happens to my home loan that was lent to me in fiat? Will they just let me pay it off in btc? How will they know they’re getting the right amount? 
@_date: 2018-08-04 01:37:45
They ruling states that businesses can’t offer incentives for using one payment over another. It’s not a very large step to say that applies to crypto as well.  If this ruling doesn’t forbid it now. The next case certainly will.
@_date: 2018-08-03 22:37:37
If I read this right, I believe this ruling suggests otherwise. At least in the USA.
@_date: 2019-03-30 12:07:05
Woah woah woah. This looks like freedom and we can’t have that. Time to regulate this exchange.
@_date: 2019-03-30 23:04:41
Unfortunately I believe we will see them try.

That’s not entirely true. They know how much I make. They have no idea how much I have.  They don’t know what I spend it on. It would be impossible for them to make a list of my assets. But with blockchain they will.  And I can easily imagine a scenario where they take over healthcare and start making rules about what you can consume because “healthcare”. Blockchain will enable them to know every single thing about us because there is no privacy.  Not to mention individuals will have this same knowledge. There are a plethora of ways this info can be used against us.
@_date: 2019-04-10 10:23:29
IMO privacy will crypto’s biggest hurdle. I don’t want people to know how much money I have. 
We’re casting off one set of chains for another.

Let’s elect Bernie. Socialism always works
@_date: 2018-07-03 18:37:04
What are you talking about? How does letting people keep more of their paycheck instead of collecting it in taxes devalue the dollar?
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:36:55
Great argument. You must not have a job or you’d know your pay went up because you’re not paying as much in taxes.
@_date: 2018-07-21 23:33:55
Btc adoption would mean that governments would no longer be able print funny money to pay for stuff
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:13:23
So you don’t understand how government taxation and redistribution of wealth makes us slaves and I’m the one that is dense?
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:55:18
My wife and I just sold our house after fixing it up for a 70k profit. We are not rich but damn was it a good investment.  
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:44:09
Because you’re taking money from people against their will and giving it to someone who didn’t earn it. I count my labor being stolen from me at gunpoint and having to continue to do that against my will as slavery.
You’re allowed to donate as much money to the government as you want . They won’t turn it down. Why are all these hypocrites on the left not giving their money away? Every single person from Donald trump to Elizabeth warren does every single thing they can to keep as much money as they can, and rightly so. They earned it.
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:52:28
Do you buy the top and sell the bottom?
@_date: 2018-07-03 18:50:54
I totally agree with that! I’m a proponent of cutting about 3/4 of government spending. I wish they had done that first. Can’t do it though or the takers will riot
@_date: 2019-09-21 03:05:42
They should probably have a ubi. Are they Neanderthals or something? Gah! Socialism is cool. Like the poopy flavored lollipop.

You’ve never read the federalist papers huh? Time to rethink your education 
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:28:51
Are you talking about the tax cuts? All benefited from them. Don’t be another half retarded millennial
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:27:43
Both are equally retarded.
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:47:15
you’re just salty because you’re not stealing as much from people anymore. Are you one of those half retarded millenials with a degree in dance theory? Go back to your slavery rally . oops I meant Bernie sanders rally 
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:32:57
I am not happy with the way most things have gone in the USA for a long time. Bitcoin seeks to solve one of the issues that has kept man down forever.  I love that it’s deflationary. I love that there is a limited supply. But taxes and spending is not what is devaluing the dollar. It is having an effect because we’re so in debt and it’s the only way to keep up the illusion. But the reason the dollar devalues is there is no limit to printing fiat.
If bitcoin were the only currency in the USA would its value decrease because of spending deficits? No we would be in enormous debt but the principals behind bitcoin would not allow its value to cheapen because of it. Our government would be forced to cut spending or fail. Socialism would be outed for the lie that it is and we could move on.

Probably should just stick to being a dentist
@_date: 2019-09-19 10:57:06
It’s funny that you think socialism benefits everyone.
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:23:25
I don’t agree with the tariffs either but letting people keep the money they earn is a good thing and every person with a job has benefitted.
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:57:06
My reason has nothing to do with regulation it has everything to do with protecting your natural right to your property. People stealing from you is violating that right. Protecting your natural rights is literally the only reason for government. It’s the only job they should have.  Being downvoted for wanting thieves to be punished is fucking hilarious.
