epik.com because they will host sites that mainstream hosts won't. I go out of my way to support companies who have balls.
High ticket items because purse.io gives a 25% discount
I like poker.
YouTubers who've been banned from paypal due to their political views.
Basically my interest in cypto is the censorship resistance.

Also this sub reddit deleted articles about this story, this story is old now. Why is a bitcoin sub deleting posts about bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-10 17:53:53
It's so weird seeing people hate on bitcoin cash when its faster &amp; cheaper. I use it between friends and doing online shopping. Why hate a money, it's just weird. It's like making a meme insulting the Japanese yen like why
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:47:27
well, Ive paid back friends for food in BTC and BCH, bch is always instant and the fees were always low.. i also play online poker with bch
i don't really understand why people get so emotional, it's just another cyptocurrency, why get "mad" at people who like to use it? lol
