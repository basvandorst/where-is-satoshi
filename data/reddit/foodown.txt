Yeah I get it, Bitcoin is the greatest thing since sliced bread in your mind.
The problem is, Bitcoin may not be like any of those things that you listed. Fire or radio waves wouldn't and didn't need fanboys out "spreading the word." It will succeed or fail based on its merits.
You guys come across like a bunch of teenaged, female fans of the latest boy band: The rest of the world just *doesn't understand* that 1D is the greatest thing ever.

Paste in where I've been a proponent of dogecoin, and I'll respond.
EDIT: And actually ... Please clarify as to what reason you have to suspect this. (That I'm lying.)

LOL ... Is this the same way that Republicans are worried about the public being too stupid to elect their candidate? Or, maybe it's like members of a religious group worrying that people just won't be smart enough to want to convert?
Can you people even hear yourselves when you say this shit?

An iteration doesn't have to improve on anything; It's just another version, another implementation of the same idea.
VHS came after BetaMax, improved on nothing, was actually inferior in many ways, and proceeded to completely dominate and replace Beta.


LOL ... You're a trip, dude. A "disease" of an "altcoin," popularized by "children?"


Pretty funny.

Now I'm 100% sure.
Off my lawn, now, kid.

The first iterations of new ideas and technologies are rarely the ones that actually get mass adoption.
Your "logic" here is not even just flawed, but non-existent.

You and those like you being a part of a recurring, studied phenomenon doesn't make your actions rational or defensible. It doesn't even make you important.


I'm "making fun" of your blind devotion, despite the obvious, *large* problems with Bitcoin. I think it's becoming increasingly obvious to dispassionate observers that Bitcoin is revolutionary, and will surely be improved upon by some yet-to-be-developed, somewhat similar, *superior* cryptocurrency, some iteration of which may very well see widespread adoption.

I'd put about 80% odds on me being older than you.

There's no need for a parody of this subreddit anymore ... As a community, you've passed the line where Poe's law applies.
The onion headline: **"Proponents of Unregulated, Anonymous Cryptocurrency Demand Oversight, Transparency"**

They probably realized what a pain in the ass using bitcoin was and stopped bothering.

This is one of the gayest things I've seen in this sub in a long time ... A long time.
EDIT: The last thing that was this gay was the guy who wanted this one image that he'd made to be the "new image" that everyone should "use for bitcoin" because it showed "how everything was interconnected and bitcoin was *right in the middle* of all that!"
That guy was more queer than this OP, but the two are close in that competition.

Looks like this sub's growth has slung the bitcoin price onto its back and stabilized it!!
Great work, (Better graph.)

Booo! Downvote! OP is a fag!
