Aantonop said specifically bitcoin will be attacked from every angle, and the branding/social angle is absolutely the worst one to deal with in the “buy a troll army” era. I don’t know, but i’ll be sure to ask the next BCH shill i see, if he is done stroking Rogers hard throbbing purple lambo or if he needs some more wax-on wax-off time. A thank you to all the good tireless redditors dealing with te FUD on a fact basis in replies. The stuff floating around here, especially on “new” view is extremely disheartening at times.

This is where it is going and it is going there sooner than we think. single sign on is already a wide reality for 95% of services, either Facebook, Google or Live is basically accepted anywhere, linking a crypto currency to your sign on is not even that complicated for these guys. I just don’t know if it will be lightning, or something new, my guess is something new, although the big guns running lightning nodes would be “epic”. Black Mirror S01e02 back story showed how merits you earned pay for things like the ability to skip adverts, Crypto currencies will work beautifully for those kind of things. Gonna be a big year!

I suggest focusing on what you CAN do rather, work, learn (dev/ai/analytics/python/robotics) amass knowledge, turn it into fiat by showing off skillz online doing odd jobs. They don’t care about age, and convert that into gold, silver, and then blow what you can afford on bitcoin when legal. That being said, plenty ways to get bitcoin under the radar, it is just a premium usually, but hell bitcoin swings 15% in a day, so what if it costs a little more now, this is the long game. Bonus jf bitcoin does die your still a smart mofo with a yacht in your early 30’s by catching the next tech wave and staying on top of it.

Hyperinflation also happens when productivity crashes or when the currency is not “trusted”, as the government backing the fiat is failing. It also happens when the gov prints too much money against the available production. If everybody can buy lambos, the price goes up so everybody can not buy lambos as there are only so many produced. This can happen to everything in country. Especially import heavy countries.

You can in no way go wrong with python at any stage in life. The current craze with huge skills shortage is good data wranglers, but you need people that can build the capacity too! DevOps. People that can do big data and build good code to crunch massive datasets win. Stuff like ELF stacks, mongo, the apache family of data processing stacks with hadoop. 90% python, and python is used by everybody, so lots of help. 
Glad you got some coin! Now stop staring at charts and get coding at something that stares at the charts for you. A human mind is not going to time the market, but you can code an AI that might one day see opportunities. “Nothing is random when you have enough data”.

The darknet cannot function without bitcoin, and all it implies. Dealers don’t take credit cards.
There is always a requirement to funnel anonymous cash cross international borders, bitcoin is amazing at making this simple and much safer, that business is growing tremendously.
That said, country borders are becoming like zoned DVDs. Borders are meaningless, a global digital currency is inevitable.
Limited supply, much like gold, getting harder to mine economically thus rising price.
Failed nation residents naturally gravitate to stability, and the current generation is much more switched on digitally and hard cash is dying, especially if you can’t get to any.
MasterCard/VISA could have long since built something better, their the next Taxi/Uber fight and shops are taking notice due to their lack of innovation and exorbitant charges.
World is primed for a currency revolution, and nobody with “money” is going to like it.
Information becoming more valuable than actual physical stuff and dealing with “banks” and international currency controls is a pain for consumers (who are global), and costly for suppliers (who are global), and everybody is a supplier of something these days, which leads to, Micromontization is going to be a thing, and robots and programs are going to need “bank accounts” as well. They don’t have identity documents to apply for currency, and will trade among themselves autonomously, and across borders, and with physicals. Bitcoin, especially lightning and next innovations are perfect for scenarios to describe value without currency.

Blocksize increases are like bandwidth increases, demand quickly matches capacity. In the old days you couldn’t youtube, upgrade bandwidth, sd youtube, upgrade, now you do HD, upgrade, 4k, it is never ending. I give it a month and the demand will be for 8Mb then 16Mb, and then the demand will be for blocks every 5 minutes, then 2... it is not the solution. You cannot scale the capacities and throughput infinity to solve it because demand will ALWAYS outstrip available capacity in short order. The high fees and backlogs are absolutely an issue, bigger blocks does not and never will solve it. Bitcoin level 1 will end up being like a bullion clearance network for billions ( the rates and speeds are great when you move millions compared to current tech btw) level two and three will deal with the small change transactions in their own ledgers.

It is downloading and checking new blocks mined for any transactions that might include your keys. Part of running a proper client with your own keys instead of some exchange linked no ownership thing. In fact, if a proper bitcoin client is NOT doing a syncing routine i would be very worried about legitimacy. Mine usually syncs up fast, even left closed for a week it takes only a minute with 3G, few seconds with LTE to catch up.

The September drop. I still get nightmares. I cannot even pretend to imagine what events in 2012, 2014 would have felt like. I described owning bitcoin recently as, “playing the lottery every 10 minutes, even when you sleep, but the winning numbers wipe everyone out”.  Can’t believe that was barely 3 months ago!
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:03:53
Exactly, i see a lot of moaning about fees and delays, but then who is moving the price around so much then? The price wiggled like what 35%? That is a a lot of volume, and a lot of coin! The charts still show 300k plus transactions getting done. I need to look at some more charts to confirm but one of the charts on blockchain.info is actually showing a slight downward trend in fees over the last few months! If the fees were a problem, it would show a decline in use, it is still going pedal to the metal.

Current market value still “buy out” able by large financial institutions, essentially they can continuously pump and dump the price until it becomes unusable. Essentially create ridiculous buy/sell walls. 
They can flood the mempool with just high enough fee, but useless, transactions for a few weeks on end basically making the network unusable. 
Buy up 70+% of the mining pools, shut it all down for a few weeks in one go, no transactions go through, difficulty adjustments are not instant. 
All the serious risks are political/status quo threat related, and they have very deep pockets. 
Hell a gov can threaten a few of the core dev family members with death and let them slowly change the code base in a “poor decision” direction, which everybody then dumps eventually.
DDOS full nodes into oblivion for a few weeks. The peer list is public. Take them offline, squash any new ones, no transactions, no value.
Hack/social engineer/insert spies in all mayor exchanges, create mass hysteria and manipulate the market into uncertainty. You only have to create distrust once if done properly.

It is the transaction cost percentage of transaction value graph, apologies, “slightly” increasing over a few months, looks like it moved .2% up since January. Right now the cost is around 1.2%. It is just above the middle of where it was about the entire year.

Lighting is about the ability to send/receive millions of transactions between parties that agreed to it, without touching the blockchain, except to state the opening and final balance. The balances go to the blockchain, what happens between the balances peer to peer, no validation required (while still safe!). It takes bitcoin from being like handing out physical cash level of speed to VISA levels of speed!

I think he meant what i experience as well, that buying a fixed dollar amount at regular intervals at this point have a quickly diminishing amount of bitcoin in return. If your aim is to get to the holy 1 BTC, you might never get there with regular investment. My regular job pay does not grow as fast as bitcoin.So either you lower your lifestyle, take a loan or not get to 1, ever. You don’t lose by buying regularly, you just don’t get to have 1 BTC.

The price was crazy because people were speculating like crazy about the futures! Since nothing actually really happened it quieted down, next steps to stir the price around would be china banning bitcoin “for reals” this time, we promise, or miners manipulating mempool for high fees, or, roger ver pulling a new fast one, or bitcoin is dead, or a shiny new meme amping up the price again. Also it is vacation time, and xmas! People paying for holiday stuff and gifts instead of dumping more fiat in bitcoin perhaps, maybe even some profit taking to buy these things. My guess is stable or slight downward trend for now and a Saturn 5 climb after the first week in Jan to catch up.

See some murmurs, put money on exchange, ok i’ll wait 24 hours.. start dropping. Okay, little more, still dropping, okay, buy half, still dropping, okay that feels like bottom. Buy all! Yhay i learned to not buy at ATH! That all happened LAST WEEK, and i have no more free cash for the rest of the month! Missed the entire storm yesterday. Point being, catching a dropping knife is neigh impossible. Evening avoiding buying at an ATH is 50/50. It is funny people yelling at the drop. Zooming out just a week is still up 5%. The guys holding now, are going to be the reserve banks of the future!

Also traced another one, slightly changed words and address, 0.7 BTC. That is just sad.

I punched the numbers on this a while back, for science. To take one core out of on average of four, 24/7, from 350 desktop computers, you can’t mine bitcoin obviously, but there are alts, nicehash, etc etc. Your better off mining on a single 1070ti, prob even lower. Even all four cores, only at night, 10 hours,1080ti easily beats it. Don’t waste your time, not worth the risk, management, fluctuations, and those desktops don’t handle high temps. Their likely dust ridden accidents waiting to happen, and who will explain all the frozen, burned out machines. If you don’t own it, don’t mine on it.

He’s not, it is just not exactly called a facebook plan, but Facebook discounts/covers the charges. They do in my country.
So you only need a tiny data contract if you only use facebook. Likely pushing specific adverts as well. So what happens is your data is up and thus you keep on facebooking for hours extra to pass time. Horrible cycle. Data is super expensive here, some provide free whatsapp as well, but only text.

Crap advice, nobody knows what internet magic money is going to do next, waiting is the worst thing to do. 
Set a goal, execute a plan, preferably one that looks ahead longer than a year. If you fail, it is okay, you made a decision and sticked to it, it is called “taking responsibility”, if you win, same. I bought at nearly every ATH, still ahead. Just make a decision, and own up to it!

A transaction can have multiple source addresses and destination addresses. That is why you pay per byte. Proper bitcoin wallets deal with this easily, all your private keys can be used to pay one thing or many things simultaneously in a single broadcast. You could “sweep” all your wallets to a new single wallet or spread a single wallet to many wallets.

Calm down, it is a spam attack, a set of miners are spamming low fee transactions, and mining only those transactions. Essentially paying themselves transaction fees with their own created transactions. This leaves “normal” transactions hanging. It is impossible to sustain as they run out of money, and will sort itself out. Stay calm and hodl, crypto will do what crypto does.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:50:11
In another thread a point was raised that to prevent this kind of spam is effectively censorship, which is highly against the idea of bitcoin. This is why spam on the chain is still there. It is a problem, but not the biggest problem as legit transactions have higher fees, gets grabbed by miners first. Spammer paying higher fees (like sponsored stories on facebook) naturally will run out of money long before effectively blocking legit transactions. There is however the remaining problem that if the miners are the ones spamming, they are effectively paying themselves the fee (when winning a block), and possibly winning reward too. If they don’t win they pay someone else the fee. This only costs them electricity when winning the block, which means they have to keep winning the block to sustain a spam attack or have real deeeep pockets. If there was a solution to spam, it would be gone already!
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:39:30
If you had btc before the bshit fork, and kept  the bcrap, and all the miners switch over and mine bshit, essentially the dollar value of btc will transfer to btripe over a period of time as the chain gets longer. Cashing out means you pick a side, not doing it leaves some flexibility and you have the value of both. This only holds for, old users, as people cash out either side the value moves to one side. I don’t know how much was mined before the fork, or how much have moved around since but it could certainly boost either side. Point being, unless bmud completely and utterly disappears, no nodes, no miners, it could have as much value as btc if the chain keeps getting longer and getting more hash power. Which would be bad, a couple of early adopters suddenly stay rich anyway, but recent btc buyers will lose everything. The thing self heals, as long as miners chase money, btc will prevail. The recent “dip” resulted in miners earning fees never seen before, multitudes of reward. Miners chasing politics, governments, it gets dangerous.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:33:50
I think the pool is still getting sorted out with backlog, and since a lot of priority buying going on with higher fees than yours, you’ll likely have to be patient! If a Mb of transactions with fees higher than yours are available to mine, obviously they will mine that, first, at “night”/weekend it slows down too so it catches up and the recommended transaction fee will drop lower as well. The reason some lower transactions go through quicker is pure because they fit in a certain byte range to pad to certain size or, it fell in a miners pool that mines blocks more often, or the exchange that sourced them are artificially prioritized by a certain pool

I agree, i am not smart enough to figure out a solution unfortunately that does not result in censorship. Everybody is saying bigger  blocks will make things better is like saying adding more bandwidth reduces email spam. It just moves through quicker. My ideas revolve around transaction submission rate limits for specific source network addresses for specific sizes, sat/bytes, values, but obviously unworkable as exchanges generally could legitimately generate anything at any rate. Bitcoin is open source, can contribute any ideas to the problem

Because it is an attack, you send in mass idiot no skill zombies through a thin gate preventing high value elite marines from being effective. It works until you run out of zombies, or the marines no longer exist. The best thing to do is keep using marines until the zombies are done. Point being, giving up on bitcoin now as a network means those wielding the zombies win. This is why zombies and spam is so darn effective.
Fortunately putting zombies on bitcoin costs sats per byte and is unsustainable, and if it fails it is money down the drain!

Of course bitcoin is better but show a dollar bill to earlier cultures and it would be magic papyrus money. Saying wait for the dip, which was the topic of this thread, is like trying to beat inflation when dealing with fiat. Futile. Bitcoin shines due to limited supply.

I’m wondering on the other hand, at what hash rate, currently approaching a obscenely huge number, double since august in fact, would it become more profitable to mine private keys from known to be holding bitcoin public keys, instead of mining for the reward. Guessing a private key is extremely improbable, so is finding the next block hash. Bitcoin is building i very large compute cluster, and yes it is good at sha256, but not all of it is. With where the value is going, the difficulty as well, it just might become profitable at some point in future

I'm sure smarter people than me have put a lot of thought into it, but people didn't walk around with kilo's of gold buying groceries, and didn't have credit cards in 1450. Fiat was born out of convenience, trust and anonymity. Those basic principles of money unfortunately no longer hold true in all fiat cases, thus enter Bitcoin. Bitcoin is too hard for day to day, and it is frankly very technology dependent. Cash always works, during earthquakes, EMP's, floods, the indian grocer, the towing guy. It sometimes feels like we have gone full circle on energy required to transfer value between people. Anything less than full nodes are centralization right, which bitcoin is not suppose to be. How much will it cost the bakery down the street to run a full node versus visa transaction process costs right now? IT support charges, bandwidth, storage, software training. It is still just too much effort than some cash over the counter, a child can use cash. Wake me up when a full active node fits in a wallet, and can process a payment in the middle of the desert. Then i know it is "mainstream"

At the sizes you indicate + anonymity you are looking at huge handling fees and significant trust requirements, Your best bet is word of mouth and taking it very very slowly.
