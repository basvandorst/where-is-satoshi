TL/DR it's a blockchain based key value store. Basically it will allow sites to accept and verifying login credentials through the blockchain, so the site never needs to store anything about the user, it can use the blockchain for 100% of its authentication and never needs to store user data on their own servers

I disagree with the initial premise that first time bitcoin users are even remotely likely to purchase a half a bitcoin, let alone a full bitcoin

Are you fucking joking? 
* BetCoin Dice
* Lucky Bit
* SatoshiBones
* SatoshiDICE
* Counterparty (old encoding)
* Mastercoin
Again I say, are you fucking joking?

Are you just a troll? The current reward of BTC is worth 11973.50 US dollars... And you can just convert BTC to USD, so you can buy anything with it...

If they're grouping the digits by 3's, they're probably using them as commas

Not OP but I found this on the site:
"We can customize machines to fit specific requirements, but basic configurations start from $7000. Get in touch!"

I am! Anyone who drives a car is required to meet smog requirements regardless of their belief systems. Anyone who goes to school or who is around large numbers of people have similar requirements they must abide by, once it starts affecting other people, that's when it can be regulated and enforced

If this is true it would 100% defeat the purpose of the device

I thought that was new currency generated from the block?

Uhh is it just me or does that seem a little expensive for a device that's based on a $35 device?
@_date: 2015-01-06 09:16:34
Where do the fees go?
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:34:29
Extremely! 
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:56:40
You don't earn any of the fee do you?
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:16:56
I'm pretty sure the way coinbase works is they combine transactions into groupings of transactions to split fees between multiple multiple people
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:29:52
coinbase fees != bitcoin transaction fees

They better add an in app confirmation on that thing. Before you know it, apps will be throwing up 2btc microtransacitons under your finger hoping you got it in your wallet.
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:13:49
@_date: 2015-09-21 03:23:21
Exactly. And they'd be no reason to do so because they'd only be able to get their own fees

Because it would add a large number of connections that it has to support just for your node

It's following the "free rice" model, very similar design.
