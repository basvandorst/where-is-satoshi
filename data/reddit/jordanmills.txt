It is factory reset. Apps can't read settings from other apps on that platform any way. And what even if it could, what would it do with them without a network connection or powered off?
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:38:44
A separate email account from a more secure provider that is a smaller target?
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:13:55
How do you mean?
@_date: 2014-07-14 23:07:37
Especially when anyone can apparently request your account be reset through SMS, even if the account owner turned it off.  I still haven't heard if they've fixed that yet.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:40:11
I think that would be super.  
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:06:08
Three immediately (minutes or seconds) before the compromise.  Several more before that.
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:15:07
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:28:32
Why do you keep telling people that the CB email address was to Gmail? You know that is not true.
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:50:03
Well that seems to be supported by cb support's near-immediate assumption that the attacker had bypassed 2FA with out them thinking it was a big deal.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:09:35
That was my motivation in making my own thread.  I spent a week going back and forth with support with them coming up with one excuse after another before I posted about the apparent issue.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:25:41
Actually that is not correct. Ach withdrawals can be reversed. You seem dedicated to derailing the topic and posting misinformation. Do you have an agenda here?
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:14:14
IIRC, I created a case for it, they sent some instructions, I did what it said, and I stopped getting SMSs.  It was last year though. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 23:05:38
No, I turned that off per their instructions.  Someone other than me turned it on again.  And it doesn't really matter, most (all?) carriers give you some way to access text messages online.  So their excuse is basically ready to use for anyone.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:17:00
1. I have considered that but then the password manager could be compromised.
2. I mean a rotation for changing them on a schedule at different times. I do not reuse them.
3. Nope, you can send/receive at the web site of many carriers. Messages.ATT.net for example.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:00:35
That is how it seems.
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:51:17
I didn't change the phone number, I followed instructions to disable sms 2fa.
Fair analysis though.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:24:24
I'll definitely keep using bitcoin.  None of my wallets or accounts anywhere else where touched.  My recent experience involved only Coinbase. 
I don't use Ubuntu and I'm not going to bother with the lunix ranting.  I also don't use gmail and wouldn't start using them after this.
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:37:54
Okay I have no reason to believe that. I haven't shoulder surfed everyone everywhere to make sure they are not using my passwords.
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:59:14
Not super popular.  Custom domain so the host isn't immediately obvious.  
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:38:26
I am working on a full scan of the two workstations I have accessed CB from. But they would have had to brute force a much longer and more complex password to get admin access, disable driver signature enforcement, and sneak a driver onto the system. Unlikely.
Good security is a function of less than perfectly secure factors.  And two factor auth when used properly makes it not a chain.
Is there some way of setting up a Coinbase account without email that most people are not aware of? Did you miss the part where I followed their instructions to stop sms 2fa? And what makes you think I used Gmail for setting up the account? Did you bother to read my post? 
You seem to just want to come here and rant about windows.  You should keep that in @_date: 2014-02-07 21:50:31
Yeah that would be kind of a HUGE issue. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:37:21
I have better security on the computers I use to access financial stuff than most large corporations do on their network cores.  Thanks, and same to you.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:14:47
They told me that I had to remove the number, add it back, and mot enable sms on it or something like that. If that still leaves it enabled, it is a huge hole.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:27:50
I would not trust Gmail for something like that.
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:12:27
I personally wouldn't put much stock in even "semi-reliable" sources with vague claims.  But my personal experience makes me wonder.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:23:23
It is unlikely they got into my email. It is also protected with a compels password and non-sms 2fa
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:37:11
A, it would have still required compromising a separate account with its own totp 2fa
B, I had followed their instructions to remove sms 2fa specifically because I did not want going even to a separate account.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:52:04
I don't think so. I never got a password reset email or a notification that it was reset.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:50:07
Just means you change the password on your accounts on a schedule.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:16:13
Yes and CB said it was done via tor so they seemed to have foreknowledge of it.
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:58:49
Well I've got auth failures listed in the log and no lockout.
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:59:04
That is exactly what I experienced.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:39:37
Absolutely. I know many exchanges do that. It is idiotic that it is not at least an option.
@_date: 2014-02-10 00:00:05
My email wasn't related to it.  They exploited what appears to be a bug in 2FA (reenabled SMS 2FA after I disabled it) and reset my password.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:57:52
I didn't use SMS.  I used a TOTP app like Authy.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:17:39
You are correct. Coinbase has a duty to not process transactions that they know are fraudulent.
@_date: 2014-07-14 23:04:21
I don't.  Especially after a hole in their password reset system was used to clear out my balance minutes after a deposit cleared.  They said that my phone account must have been cracked, too bad, you're out ten grand.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:39:40
Maybe, but people are sucking it down.  The concern is that people will listen to its misinformation in threads about apparent 2FA issues at Coinbase and not take any extra care... then lose their money.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:57:46


Then how did it happen to me in the space of about two minutes in the middle of the night?
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:13:16
Long, complex, multiple character sets.  The ones in use then could be described as at least eight characters long, at least one upper case, lower case, numeral, and punctuation.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:45:53
Yep, but they would have my CB account password or 2fa secrets, lol.
But it would be difficult to compromise my computer. The drive is encrypted, driver signature enforcement is on, and executables have hash checking.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:22:27
No, I actually avoid logging into the GV account because of that kind of thing.  Pretty much all my SMS interaction is through forwarding to the number of the cell in my pocket.
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:22:05


Well mine wasn't locked. Multiple auth failures were noted in the CB access log.  Lockout has either been disabled or does not have effective triggers.
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:18:13
That seems to be completely incorrect.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:12:23
Phone, very unlikely. They would have had to know where it is, which one it is, the password, and have done it while I was sleeping a few feet away.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:25:52
That reduces the solution space for any one character in the string. But it is still a large(ish) space.
Yes, those restrictions are lame. The max length is idiotic. I would feel much better with mssl or the like.
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:13:35
I was waiting for a purchase to be deposited, it had been delayed IIRC.  I wasn't planning on keeping it there forever.
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:29:59
Actually bitcoin-otc has been doing this for years.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:49:16
An in-depth review of logs is on the list.  First up was changing all passwords everywhere, getting all certificates revoked and reissued, and 2FA authentication secrets changed.  But I have a day job and all of that takes a good bit of time.
FWIW I hadn't seen any suspicious activity warnings or failed authentication attempt notices on any of my accounts in the past several weeks.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:22:19
Of course you enter them on your pc.  They're kind of useless if you just look at them.
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:29:52
I believe I stopped getting SMS messages after I followed their instructions to disable SMS 2FA.  Apparently it was reenabled somehow...
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:44:59
That was right, the password did not work immediately after the attack.
CB said they would address the withdrawal, then it disappeared from the record on their site. Then it came back.
They did reset it. Both Coinbase and the account's activity log say that. Are you just making up stuff so you can post?
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:02:42
This is not a problem with bitcoin. That just happens to be what was taken.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:58:53
They don't seem interested in addressing what seem to be major issues.  This is about making sure that the community knows about a potential major exploit and can investigate on their own.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:42:36
Sounds par for the course. Olaf made a post here. I asked him the many netsec questions I also asked CB support and never got answers to. I doubt they will answer them here either.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:59:59
Lol the cops wouldn't be able to do anything.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:20:36
Yep. Cold wallet. I normally do that but was waiting for a transaction to clear. Just a couple of days.
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:02:37
No.  I just edited the main post to include it.  API access wasn't enabled, and they said it was done through their web site any way.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:13:39
I had turned it off.  It somehow got enabled again.
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:01:23
Yeah that is not cool. If you authorized the ach and they delivered, you should not be flagging it.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:41:58
Correct. None of my wallets, bank accounts, or other exchange accounts were attacked. Only Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:13:58
No cleaner, no mates go in my bedroom really, and nobody know any of the details like where it is or now to get to it.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:38:28
Depends on how the server does it. Nt lanman hashes, for example (what you are probably remembering) do not distinguish in case.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:19:49
It was all within seconds.  It would have taken them longer to delete the emails than to initiate the transactions.
I've seen no indication of keylogging, I'm pretty careful about what computers or VMs I use for what, my hard drives are encrypted, I don't use admin accounts for anything except system maintenance, I don't do links in emails unless I JUST requested a verification, and I check SSL certs before entering credentials in any site at all important.  It is VERY unlikely that I was logged or phished.  
It comes down to poor IDS/notification and how an attacker bypassed and/or reenabled SMS 2FA.
Edit: Also note that I have other bitcoin-related accounts elsewhere and there were no attempts to get anything out of them.  This centers entirely around Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:28:45
I didn't clear/lock it because Coinbase said it would be addressed and the transaction appeared to be gone from my account.
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:11:11
I specifically asked CB support about disabling sms 2fa. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:52:49
It wasn't either. I disabled sms 2fa per their instructions.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:53:38
You should see [my recent thread](  I had it enabled and had my account drained.  They still said it was my fault.  It looks like 2FA isn't going to help you with them.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:26:50
That is what a bank will say they can demand will advise you to do.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:36:25
Actually there are parts of their story (and coinbitch's misinformation campaign) that are easy to demonstrate as untrue.  They seem dedicated to insisting that I used the same account for gv and for the email address for my CB account. They are different accounts from different providers.  As I said in the original post, I had 2fa enabled on the email address used for CB and did not get a password reset link any way.
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:26:29
Funny, last night I had an issue with a cracked account on a different service where they seemed to bypass 2FA.  I wonder if something is up.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:11:31
Coinbitch seems to constantly run around in here, make up details for other people, and tell everyone how they're wrong and Coinbase couldn't possibly have made a mistake.  I reported a few instances to the mods where he/she/it/they were assuring people of one thing when another was clearly stated in my post... and never even got a reply.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:57:11
Keep in mind that the 2fa tokens to both Coinbase and my email were stored on a phone with the battery removed.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:59:23
It's a typo when I meant to type complex password.
That email address also has totp 2fa and shows no signs of compromise.  There wasn't so much as a single failed auth on any other account.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:46:24
So why were there several failed login attempts in the activity log? You seem to have trouble keeping all the facts in your head at one time.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:53:26
My Google account was not linked to Coinbase. It was not added to the account as far as I could tell. How did they get around that?
My account was set to not use that phone number for 2fa. How did they change that?  why is that even a default?
Why was the account not locked after multiple authentication failures?
Why did I not get a notification of authentication failures?
Why did I not get any notification that my password was changed?
Why do you allow tor nodes access to authenticate when you are required to keep identity info per aml laws?
Why was the ach withdrawal still processed after I informed support that it was fraudulent?
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:48:31


Well that is not helpful. They told me to was possible to block that... not cool at all.
It still doesn't explain how they reset the password without access to the email account I used with Coinbase that has non-sms 2fa enabled. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:39:02
I used it for purchasing btc with usd. No other accounts nor any of my wallets were touched. Only Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:00:04
I work in it on server infrastructure. I am rather familiar with workstation security.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:13:27
Far as I know, nobody has my password.  I dont access these accounts from computers I do not control.
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:58:22
It cost me several BTC.  I was pretty insistent about it.  They have done their best to blow me off and say it's not their problem.
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:44:44
The only involvement that Google had with this was google voice.  The email address is served by a different provider with different authentication and TOTP 2FA.  I said that in the original post.  I'm not sure why people keep assuming that the email and SMS were the same account.
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:00:05


In my experience, that will not change anything.
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:33:01
Might be talking about me.  There were other instances where it was done through the API.  In my recent case, Coinbase allowed them to reenable SMS 2FA even though I'd disabled it with the intent to use only TOTP 2FA.
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:27:38
Unlikely.  The password had recently been changed and the email address wasn't linked to anything else.  They still would have had to get into my Coinbase email address and bypass its 2FA.  There were emails for the transfers and purchase, all of which were done in one to two minutes - I don't see why they would have left some but not others.
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:57:18
Neither. Microsoft authenticator.  
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:08:05
It looks like they were only able to reset it once, but yes.  It was google voice, but I guess you can do all those services with the same google ID.
The email address used with Coinbase is not related to google in any way and has its own non-SMS 2FA.  It shows no signs of compromise nor any odd behavior.
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:41:18
Apparently by being able to snoop a single use 2fa code, an attacker can later determine the correct code for any time period, but only if the victim uses windows.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:12:50


You have been told several times that is completely incorrect.  You seem to be the only one insisting I was using a gmail account.  And you seem dedicated to making sure everyone else thinks that.
@_date: 2014-02-09 07:19:36
It seems that Coinbase is having some SERIOUS problems with their 2FA.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:15:49
It's possible that the gmail account was compromised or the messages were intercepted.  Coinbase says the attacker used an SMS code to authenticate and reset the password.  But as far as I can tell, they didn't get access to my email.
The problem is that I specifically disabled SMS 2FA per coinbase's instructions because I don't trust SMS or my google account.  It seems that the attacker was able to reenable it.
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:07:54
Or as the site using it.  I wasn't using SMS for 2FA.  That's the whole point.
@_date: 2014-02-09 07:26:55
I didn't.  I disabled the SMS 2FA per coinbase's instructions and used only my TOTP app.  It was reenabled.  From what other users say, it can always be reenabled.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:26:15
The Coinbase account is not linked to the Gmail account. The pc I set it up with shows no signs of compromise and it is not my general use pc any way.
An attacker would have had to compromise three separate systems, two with 2fa, to do this.  Or just find an exploit in Coinbase, which is already rumored.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:02:06
They should have, IMO. They did not. There was a record of several failed attempts immediately before the compromise, enough that IDS should have been triggered but not enough for a brute force.
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:07:24
Exactly one instance I'm talking about.  CoinBitch keeps making up stories about this and trying to convince everyone that I'm changing my story.
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:29:31
If there is some level of trust, you can exchange a private key as value.  But they have to trust that you aren't handing them an empty wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:54:34
I've heard from a few sources that this has happened, but I don't have anything specific enough to consider it more than hearsay.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:49:26
Which lies are those?
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:43:03
Far as I can tell, it worked just fine. Coinbase even confirmed that an sms code was used for 2fa... after I followed their directions to disable sms 2fa.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:54:34
No.  My CB account was set up under a different email address that has (non SMS) 2fa.  Already explained that several times, not sure why coimbitch keeps saying otherwise.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:47:01
I am well familiar with that, though I believe the entropy of a string of dictionary words is overrepresented.  I doubt it was the password - they just reset it.
@_date: 2012-07-31 21:43:16
Hell no.
@_date: 2012-08-03 14:28:00
Ah nice.  And this is why I don't actually deal guns.
@_date: 2012-07-31 14:34:48
'Cause you want to pay in BTC.  That's about it.
@_date: 2012-08-01 04:37:27
Dum liberalz is stewpid
@_date: 2012-08-01 04:38:47
Yes and yes.  I'll share it once the shop fully signs on.
@_date: 2012-08-03 14:29:08
Yeah, if I sell one of my private arms, I'll definitely accept BTC for it.  I just want to make sure I keep it all very separate from the finance facilitation I'm doing with the FFL.  I do NOT want the wrong kind of attention from the ATF.
@_date: 2012-07-31 22:17:02
Yes, doesn't matter what kind of gun.  Long as it's a gun or the part that makes it a gun (like an AR lower, or a glock frame), you still have to do the background check thing (unless you have a CHL, then you just fill out the form and they file it).
Difference is, you have to be 21 to buy a handgun, and only 18 to buy a rifle.
@_date: 2012-08-01 12:30:41
Almost certainly.
@_date: 2012-08-01 00:05:24
Not necessarily.  That's the detail I'm still looking at.  The way it will probably go down is that I would sell store credit and forward a request for purchase from the buyer.  The store would honor the credit and process the sale.  
I might just be a "payment processor" like paypal or visa, but that might make me subject to other regulatory things.
Or I might just become an employee of the store.  That would pretty much make it a non-issue.
@_date: 2012-08-01 00:06:20
Nice.  Well i'm talking with the shop and going to run it by a lawyer.  It's looking good right now though.
@_date: 2012-08-01 01:03:01
Sounds like a win to me.  After the shop and lawyer sign off on it, let's do it.
@_date: 2012-08-01 01:06:10
FFL is federal firearms license.  It basically means you can be a firearms "dealer".  Allows you to sell more firearms than the arbitrary limit the ATF puts on you after you've sold them.  Also lets you receive firearms in the mail.  It's not easier, it costs money, and it comes with big paperwork requirements.
@_date: 2012-08-01 04:38:01
I'm not sure how they check it.  Maybe there's an FFL ID number they check?
@_date: 2012-07-31 21:45:18
Yeah, I'd transact for whatever the store stocks.  Pretty sure ammo and accessories can be shipped direct without involving an FFL.
You definitely need the background check and to ship through an FFL on rifles or shotguns though.
@_date: 2012-07-31 22:54:32
Going rate for a built basic AR-15 looks to be a little under 100 BTC, depending on current spot.  Want to be the first?  I don't have anything set up yet, so I need a couple of days, but I'll get a description and take pictures of the exact gun you'd be purchasing, and confirm the price.
@_date: 2012-08-04 03:04:09
Yeah, the plan is basically to cash out what the shop needs in USD immediately.  I may or may not cash out my handling fee depending on how I feel about the market.
@_date: 2012-08-01 13:49:04
I'm pretty sure that would be possible with laws as they are now.  It would definitely get run by the lawyer first though.
@_date: 2012-08-01 04:37:13
Yeah dude, that's why it's "going to be" and not "am, now send me your moniez!"
@_date: 2012-08-06 17:19:11
Hopefully I'll have the backend work done soon and we can buy them legally.
@_date: 2012-08-02 15:00:14
Well hit me up if you get ready and I haven't put anything up yet.  For one or two transactions, I'm sure I could walk the shop through it as a demo.
@_date: 2012-08-01 12:30:22
Guns save lives.
@_date: 2012-07-31 14:47:56
Even if I had a spin, it would be easy to demonstrate that me claiming otherwise is just me being full of shit.  I'm only offering this to help spread use of bitcoin (yeah, and to get some sales for my local shop).  If you want to go to gunbroker.com and pay by credit card, you are pretty much guaranteed to get a better deal.
@_date: 2012-08-02 16:06:10
And guns!  Real, legal ones, not silkroad black market stuff.
@_date: 2012-08-01 00:07:17
If/when this gets going, it will be associated with a real business with a real physical presence that you can walk into, and real federal licensing.  Names, numbers, locations, etc, will all be available up front.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:37:53
I thought we could expect that today, actually.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:24:00
Oh it's possible.  Just not remotely likely before the eventual heat-death of the universe.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:24:33
I am not opposed to it.
