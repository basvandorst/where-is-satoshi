Ohhhh ok so you pay tax for amounts above what you paid when you sell. So like it would be possible to just print out your transaction history and bring it to a tax guy or something. Sorry I’m questioning so much. Just wanna be prepared when the time comes.

So what is it?  Do you pay income tax or capital gains tax on crypto gains to fiat? Noob here
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:19:58
So not to go to far into it but if you were preparing a form for taxes on gains. It would include 1) date of transaction 2) amount you bought in at 3) amount you sold at idk if I’m missing anything else here

When I first started buying I was buying Btc at like 17k so I threw like 1500 at it thinking it was going to keep going up. As far as Alts go it’s about the same story I was accumulating when the market was around 500b so I’m still kind of negative but maybe devastated was a strong word lol. At this point I buy what I can when I can basically. I haven’t sold though no worries there.

That’s how much btc I own. I didn’t specify any other crypto assets ;). I just like to accumulate btc slowly is all.

Surely this is a journey and that is a dream. But for sure I’m not quitting my day job or other future aspirations holding out hope for this to make me rich. If it did just so happen to do that great! If not then I have other plans too :) thanks for the advice though.

Maybe I wasn’t entirely clear in this post. I don’t expect to become financially free overnight but in time I’m hoping for the best. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:28:07
Yeah for sure. I put a ton in back in December and those I consider to be my initial investments. But now I just throw money at it here and there when I see new projects I like. Right now I’m really feeling icx long term.
