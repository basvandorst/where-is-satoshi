I couldn't get more than half way through the video. It just sounded like your feelings on it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:32:20
just buy with cash. trust me. Overstock fine print is terrible.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:45:16
thats not a fork doode. That is an everyday addition. You can clone the repo 'modify' and add code and request to add it to the open source project. it would not be a fork if it got added
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:03:49
Found it!

nothing will change.

There is only a small number of developers that contribute and thus regularly look. Can I ask.. Do you regularly review the commits?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:33:44
But there has to be another option. If their could be a coin where the code was stored in a democracy rather than this github 'republic', well than that would be the future. I understand your point. And all I want to do is improve my programming skills in an effort to contribute or at least understand some more. But doesn't having one person in total power over the master branch of the github repo defeat the purpose of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:50:26
Ok. I am a new/young programmer. So I am still learning all this. I guess I was thinking about small controversial topics than something like block size. Thank you for response 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:30:51
u wot mate.. The whales took us from 8k to 19k in 3 weeks. They can  decided what the price is whenever they want. and thats what they are doing. So buying and sellin based off of the futures is actually a decent idea.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:02:10
Oh shit, I hope you didn't sell the Bitcoin for Bcash. At least we can see the repo for Bitcoin Core. Isn't the repo for B-Cash private?

it's not live yet..

When you say 'run' is that like deploy the new code from the repo? Who gets to run/deploy that?

The volume they are experiencing over time, is not normal for a company. That being said I think it's good to see scheduled maintenance. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:04:38
relax bro, and don't give out so much personally info out about yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:24:12
what are you talking about?

But we can't do that every day. I mean why are we letting a small group of people be in charge of this one github repository? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:08:15
If I am not wrong, it is because it is a centralized company basically. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:43:37
cite your sources...
One of your main points was that people in Venezuela were going to jail for just holding it, well that it flat out wrong info doode. I will assume you saw an article that said Venezuelan Miners were jailed, and that is different.  Don't just sit in front of a camera spreading fud. You are wrong sir. Plus you said "urine" like 6 times gross doode.

we'll be fine. go to bed. I wouldn't sell if it went to 1 penny. I just want to buy at each drop. The reason it's so hard for most people to understand Bitcoin is that most people don't really understand money. Money isn't wealth. It's an accounting system used to facilitate the exchange of wealth. (The paradox of money is that while everyone wants it, no one actually wants it - they want the stuff they can buy with it!) Many people are put off by the fact that Bitcoins are 'just data'. But that's what ALL money is, information! More precisely, money is a means for credibly conveying information about value given but not yet received (or at least not yet received in a form in which it can directly satisfy a person's wants or
To put it yet another way, money is a ledger. With fiat currencies like the dollar, that ledger is centralized. And that gives the central authority responsible for maintaining that ledger tremendous power, power that history has proven will inevitably be abused. With Bitcoin, the ledger is decentralized. And that means that no one individual or entity has the power to arbitrarily create new units (thereby causing inflation), freeze (or seize) your account, or block a particular payment from being processed. We've had decentralized money before. After all, no one can simply print new gold into existence. And the
'ledger' of gold is distributed because the physical gold itself (the 'accounting entries' in the metaphor) is distributed. But with gold, that decentralization comes at a heavy price (literally). The physical nature of gold makes it hugely inefficient for global transactions.
And this is why bitcoin is important! It is the first currency in the world that is both decentralized and digital. It is more reliably scarce than gold and more private and transactionally efficient than "modern" digital banking. This is why people are excited about bitcoin, it has the potential to be completely revolutionize money.

I want Andreas Antonopoulos to answer this question in another awesome video. But is the best answer to just be paranoid and clone the repo everyday?
