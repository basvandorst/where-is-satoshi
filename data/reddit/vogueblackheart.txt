Sensible. Stable.
Tell ya what. Save up some pennies and go buy dinner out for yourself and a friend with them, and tell me whether the US currency's smallest current increment is reflective of either a sensible OR a stable currency.
And if you think there's a good explanation why the reigning national currency (again, sensible and stable) should have its smallest increment devalued to the point of utter uselessness (I can't fit enough rolls of pennies to buy a salad in one hand), let us hear it--and I mean more in the ideological sense than the Triffin's Dilemma sense (as I am sympathetic to the paradoxical plight of the poor world reserve currency).

I would submit that the bitcoin's price is inconsistently going up.
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:25:11
I don't know the exact answer, but I'd guess it's the same reason why the Charlie Shrem &amp; Ross Ulbricht arrests &amp; the Pirateat40 Ponzi scheme implosion caused the price to fall. The community consists partly of strong hands who don't dishoard on bad news (and seem to be increasingly buying on these dips, making them less dramatic), and partly of speculators, newbies, and other folks who don't know what to think about Bitcoin's future when hearing news like this. These folks are much more prone to panic selling.

It's pretty elegant, isn't it! Infinite divisibility allows for the population, as well as the total quantity of goods and services in the economy, to increase without the problem of the smallest unit of currency becoming too large--And more importantly, it doesn't redistribute away from the fraction of the total money supply held by every single person, invisibly and simultaneously, to the recipient of newly-created money.

maloney's simplifications are not oversimplifications; they don't detract from the salience of his points. rather, they help unearth the neofeudal scam from beneath a mountain of complexity.
this fellow's objections neither refute nor attempt to address the central issue, which is that theft is indeed intrinsic to the system. they resemble sophistry/apologism for the current system by misidentifying some acute symptoms as THE problem itself--not an uncommon thing. this critique is largely devoid of substance.

I advocate taking profits in the form of gold and silver (fiat not as attractive), but mostly holding onto bitcoins and acquiring more when they correct downward sharply, until everyone starts doing that and it stops happening.

That's a really expensive way to be vindictive. Also, people who allocate capital toward nonproductive ends gradually transfer that capital to those who put it to better use. This is why wealth inequality per se isn't a problem in a free market--It self-corrects to the extent that the wealth's holders fail to put it to the best use for society.

@_date: 2013-04-15 18:55:00
the man is disingenuous. he deliberately misleads people who haven't studied heterodox economics and critiques of keynesianism. one example he repeats endlessly is 'opponents of keynesian economics predicted interest rates on treasury bonds would have shot up, but in fact they haven't!' of course, he's pretending this is some kind of honest empirical finding while omitting the fact that the fed is suppressing these interest rates by buying 90% of new debt with money created out of thin air. he's arguing his endangered ideology to the end.

Inflation in the $-based monetary/financial system is regressive when you take into account the systemic privilege and protections enjoyed by entities plugged into the government-banking complex.
True about deflation, but that's not a bad thing in a healthy monetary system--you'll always spend money on food and things you need or desire at once, but will tend to save up for luxuries and extravagances. Hm... sounds a bit like the fiscal prudence of our elders! Contrast that with the current system, where everyone drowns in debt to drive their BMW to work to pay off their $200k law school bill. Note that deflation in this same system is a much wilder ride than under honest money--Here, it's a vicious cycle of debt destruction and lending drying up as a fractionally reserved system unwinds.

intelligent people, mike maloney among them, understand the problems with gold standards and gold-pegged currency. note that all the central banks in the world are holding (and, almost without exception, accumulating) gold--its status as the historical human wealth asset par excellence is by no means in jeopardy.
a lot of gold owners/supporters/analysts don't fully understand cryptocurrency. set an example by making sure you understand gold.
gold's 'loss' against fiat these past couple centuries was just the most recent iteration of a long term cycle--a tug of war between easy and hard money. there's much to be said on that, but in short, both inter-generational wealth assets and transient currency technologies have their functions. the next global monetary system will find them in harmony as counterbalances to each other.
