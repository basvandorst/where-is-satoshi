Thanks for that and may i ask if a bull run actually means something i should know or not lmao
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:27:03
Thang alot for the info although there were stuff you said which im not familiar with yet but that's my fault.
Sadly I'm not from the US or Canada so ill need to find another way
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:22:52


Exactly. So im good :)
@_date: 2019-09-29 02:55:50
Damn that sounds dumb as hell.
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:11:21
thanks alot for the info, and yeah its gonna take some convincing to let me parents register for me thats why im thinkin about waiting till i get my own credit cards and turn 18 so i can just register myself at my own complete risk


say, i bought some bitcoin and kept it in a local wallet liek blockchain, I wait a couple years or months and want to sell, how do i go about selling it and how is the money transferred. Into my dad's bank account or..?

@_date: 2019-09-28 13:58:31
Can you suggest one of them?
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:58:01
Ok what are you talking about fam
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:01:07


You just proved that your whole point doesnt make any sense lmao. You advised someone who's not well knowledgeable about vaccine/medicine to go to a medicine professional. Right?
But you're telling me to not take advice from people on here who know alot about bitcoin. Isnt that kinda against your antivaxx point?
Im not knowledgeable about bitcoin, so, ill go ask someone who's got much more experience and knowledge about it. Shoulda used another anology cuz this back fired hard on you....mate
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:34:41
Would it cost money to register in electrum tho?
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:52:46


Yeah I didn't.
Thanks for all the info. So you do have some experience with casa yourself and can vouch for it? Cuz im overwhelmed by the amount of options available and i need to settle on one.
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:01:45
What would you recommend as a personal wallet? Is blockchain ok? 
If i wait for 18 and get my own coin base account and wallet. Will it eliminate the whole process of moving the bitcoin all around from my wallet to my dads coinbase? As in, will my coinbase account act as my personal wallet too?
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:26:54
damn, but not everyone pays 70 bucks to get into bitcoin right? It has to be. What are some of the best wallets which do not involve additional cost (fee or physical product)
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:06:49










do any of these require you to pay a fee to register?
@_date: 2019-09-29 11:22:15
Thank you. Idk why people keep recommending mobile wallets. Why do people even use wallaets on mobile? Am i the only one who think this stuff should be done on a pc where eveything is laid out infront of you nicely and not crammed in a small screen? I just think for now im gonna be better off with a local wallet on my pc
@_date: 2019-09-29 02:54:27
Ok buddy
@_date: 2019-09-29 13:22:29
Good shout thanks
@_date: 2019-09-28 13:13:05
wow thats great. Thank you. I thought atleast the wallets would cost something
@_date: 2019-09-29 13:21:42
But i plan to hold my bitcoin, or spend it very rarely, i wouldnt benefit from a mobile wallet is that right?
@_date: 2019-09-29 11:18:53


Did you even read their replies? They were all helpful and gave me advice for what i needed to know. No one forced me to get into it or by your words, convinced me. I chose to do this and im here for help. If you dont want to help, get outta here.
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:02:09
What about on pc
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:12:07
How can someone buy bitcoins without even researching. How do they even know where to start. Ive done all this and still dont think ive grasped 10% of what i need
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:23:34
Thank you, your info was the simplest yet the most helpful. Yes, i think ill just wait till i become 18 and do all this and at the beginning im pretty sure ill just have my coin in the coinbase account as im only investing like 30 bucks. When i start buying and selling and get a good amount, ill think about the hardware ones. Thanks again
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:41:56
Thank you for the valuable information. You mentioned casa bitcoin storage, but lots of people suggested electrum as my wallet.  Do you have any experience with that? And what can you tell me about it
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:18:54
In the end, its still what i wanna do. So, thanks for the *great* advice mate. Still gonna research and buy bitcoin tho.
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:53:28
Oh thats interesting alright. So if i wanna store my coins for a relatively long time, i should use casa and if i plan to buy and sell semi-frequently, i should use electrum.
Did i get that right? Thanks again
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:03:02
@_date: 2019-09-28 14:06:14
I dont want to do all this on mobile so, sorry.
