The US is the first beneficiary of all this chaos.

Let me correct what I said. The baby boomers generation is considered to be the generation which was born between 1945 and 1965.   
As a millennial myself (35 years old) I can tell you that the millennial generation as yet to achieve anything significant in the world. It's simply too early to tell.

Yes we are.
" **Millennials**, also known as **Generation Y** (or simply **Gen Y**), are the [demographic]( [cohort]( following [Generation X]( and preceding [Generation Z]( Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with 1981 to 1996 a widely accepted definition. Millennials are sometimes referred to as "echo boomers" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the [baby boomers]( "
I was born in 84.

If we analyse how much of an average salary will go to pay debts, whether it is a house, car or health related debt, I don't think that much will be left to do anything.
In my opinion, the millennial's are the generation  have less concerns about creating a savings nest for their retirement than the previous generations, and are more concerned about travelling, paying the internet/Netflix/spotify bill and other petty necessities. This happens because debt and uncertainty about job/life stability does not allow this generation to do much anyway...
In light of this, the number of millennials which are able/will invest in crypto is small... very very small.

While I understand about the wealth transfer, you have to understand that there are more variables you need to take into account. One of them is population growth. The world population more than doubled since the 50's.This means the boomers wealth would be diluted by much more people.
And I say would, not will, because I don't actually believe such will ever happen.Depending on the kind of education a millennial has received, if the millennial in question lives in the US, UK or in any other country where higher education is expensive, chances are, that millennial is buried in debt. Interests have to be paid.
The inequalities around the world are increasing. Those who have less are leaving less to their children, and those who have a lot are leaving even more tho their children. This tells us that the concentration of wealth is increasing.
So while the transfer of wealth will be incredible large, in my opinion it will be from many to a few.

The Baby Boomers generation was born in 60's. They only got to count their wealth in the 90's.  
Most of the millennial generation is in their 30's now.  
One thing is for sure. Boomers did not had a twitter, reddit or facebook to waste their time.

We are called Millennials because our teenage life (puberty) was lived during the change of millennials. That's actually the base for the description. GenZ is called the generation which was born either at the end of the 90's or after 2000. They lived their childhood and teenage life in a world already embedded by the internet technologies, while Millennials are perfectly capable of remembering their teenage with limited or no access to the internet.Generation X is actually what Fred Durst calls his generation in "My Generation" from the album "Chocolate Starfish and a Hot Dog Flavoured Water".  Fred is now 49 years old. He was 29 when he recorded that album.
So I'm sorry that you don't like to see yourself as a Millennial (maybe because of all the negativity associated with it) but that's what our generation is called.

Which will reduce the difficulty to the remaining miners, giving them more chances of finding valid blocks. The strongest miners continue, while the weakest ones will perish. This is mining centralisation.

What are countries like Portugal, exactly ?
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:20:56


To pay national debt, it seems... Good luck with your national debt clock!

That doesn't mean anything. For what I can tell, the Portuguese economy is highly dependent on the strongest EU countries. The need the stronger business oriented countries for exportation.

And how exactly can weaker countries like Portugal, benefit from using Bitcoin as a currency?
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:24:55


Which is interesting because currently, there's a Left-wing backed socialist government in Portugal. I guess Euro is useful to keep the socialist governments in order.

I'm no specialist here and I'm usually just a lurker, but to all those present here who are specialists about the subject, I ask this question.  
Who would want to sell bitcoins for Venezuelan Bolivars, knowing the current rate of inflation?

The thing is, VISA network is not composed by just a single entity. It's a conglomoerate of entities working in parallel, where transactions can be executed on-demand. That is why you can use the VISA network to perform instant and deterministic payments.
The bitcoin network by itself, without using the Lightning Network as a second layer, cannot give you an instant transaction. You need a mined block and pay a sufficiently high fee so that your transaction can be registered in the next block. Still, this is not deterministic because in the unlikely event of a massive surge in transactions with higher fees after you perform yours, there may be the case where your transaction might not go in the next block.
But I still agree with you. Comparing the VISA network with Bitcoin Network is like comparing Oranges with Lemons. They are both citrus fruits, but even when enjoyed during their maturity, lemons will still be bitter and oranges will be sweet.  The comparison is not fair.
