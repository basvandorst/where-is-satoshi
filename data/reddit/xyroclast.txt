I guess one of the final pieces of the puzzle that I don't understand, is where is my money actually stored? What ties it to me? I'm able to change my address at will, etc.
Does my BitCoin client itself essentially store my money? If I throw my computer into a volcano, is my money gone?

Are the hacking situations recent, though? I was under the impression that it all went down awhile ago (but I could be wrong)
@_date: 2011-08-04 19:41:34
It's so neat!
@_date: 2011-08-04 11:15:17
Welp, I just bought 5 bitcoins! Wish me luck!
@_date: 2011-08-04 09:50:51
Are there safe types of volcano?
@_date: 2011-08-07 01:42:08
Thank you
It's all pretty darn interesting.

What OS? My database folder alone is over 900 MB and I've only reached 136000 blocks (they're still coming in)
(Mac 10.6)

Why would anyone want to click the "share" links? If it's first come first serve, everyone who knows about it decreases the chances...
@_date: 2011-08-04 08:57:43
So my identity is wallet.dat? Lose that, lose the bitcoins?
@_date: 2011-08-07 01:22:47
Ah, I getcha. So it's always a guideline, more of a probability of how good or bad your deal would be at a given price.
@_date: 2011-08-06 17:42:36
Uh, according to Mt Gox, bitcoin has been crashing ever since the announcement...
Crashing as in, it's already lost about 50% of its value from a day ago
So, to answer your question, maybe a failing dollar means a failing bitcoin as well. If money isn't worth anything, "fake money" should be worth even less, no?
@_date: 2011-08-06 02:05:05
I don't understand why this is even a question.
@_date: 2011-08-06 20:16:44
Aren't a significant portion of its users in the US?
@_date: 2011-08-09 04:05:07
Why are they all going in different directions, though? And what's with the $25000 increments and whatnot? I don't understand it even when I know what the lines mean....
@_date: 2011-08-04 09:02:02
Another mystery solved, thank you
@_date: 2011-08-08 00:50:14
That is a very, very good point.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:38:24
It finally went through, thanks. Any word on the Sell button? It, too, is unresponsive now, and I don't see a pending order at all this time. No idea if it's non-functional or just another delay, haven't heard any confirmation yet.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:28:17
It doesn't even seem like they're manning the switches. Their last tweet was 3h ago claiming that things are A-OK
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:53:03
Ah, I see
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:12:33
Yeah, wiak1's post has sort of a "cultish propaganda" vibe about it, gotta say.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:31:31
I don't know what that is
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:10:03
You said you had $300, then lost it, then claimed to have under $200, then said you'd have gotten a deal if you'd claimed $217
What am I missing?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:31:36
Ah, I get it now, thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:57:46
Is there a typo in your $ amounts? your story doesn't make sense as written.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:27:28
Nothing happens at all when I click the button, though, like, it doesn't even seem to be sending any data. It's acting like a totally dead CSS element. Is that normal?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:56:31
Wow, sounds reliable! Pass.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:13:26
When do you stop calling it lag and start calling it a shutdown?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:55:55
Building to infinity? It's been steadily dropping and is currently at 10 minutes.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:53:36
I just started a sale at "market value" and it came up with a price of $0. Canceling frantically.
So, in short, they're not just "running with lag", they're running with atrocious bugs, too.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:11:14
I'm completely unable to cancel my totally stuck order right now.
