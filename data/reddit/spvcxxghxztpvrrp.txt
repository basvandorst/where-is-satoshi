He's just trying to make money. Utter bullshit.

I was talking with a coworker who has a brother who "invested" in a "company" which buy coins and "guarantees" a very high ROI. But goddamn, what a mess, he thinks it only exists 3 coins and 2 of them are "fractions of Bitcoin", and then he said that he saw yesterday that BTC is $1500 (where?! I'd buy right now lmao). And guess what? With this much knowledge, he said it will throw $500 in this "company" which, as far as I understood from this bs, it does the same thing that Bitconnect used to do. I tried to explain a little better how this works and that he doesn't need no "companies" to buy crypto, but he thinks it will get rich overnight so whatever. In short, there still A LOT of naive people in this space, it gave me the 2017 vibes all over.

I don't think "everyone" will accept in just 10 years.
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:49:31
Yea if this resistance continues we can see a dump soon.
@_date: 2019-03-08 12:36:57
Or because this is a Bitcoin group.
@_date: 2018-10-29 11:48:11
In 2140 there will be no fiat anymore.
@_date: 2019-03-08 16:53:22
I'm crying about you and your friends scamming people like Bitconnect did.
@_date: 2019-03-08 12:39:43
What's up with you and this ZB shit? You repeat this on every post.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:53:32
Zimbabwe and their constant fuckery lol 
@_date: 2019-02-08 02:41:50
I’m moving everything to Bitcoin Cash. Thank you very much Roger Ver. Such a visionary. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:29:02
 this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and your business completely separated
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:57:06
Nah, this is the low already
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:22:24
I know people who bought a ton of Bytecoin 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:25:56
Tf you talking about 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:35:04
Bitcoin in 2006...?
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:29:23
Dope dealers on the dark web rather get paid in XMR tho
@_date: 2018-11-09 11:25:04
Gimme yours and be happy
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:51:41
So you rather trust a guy on reddit?
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:27:21
Brand new joke
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:30:27
How about no
@_date: 2018-11-06 14:06:44
I will never understand those people who rather buy from other person than from an exchange.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:28:21
Do you accept bitconneeeeeeeeeeeect?
@_date: 2018-11-01 12:59:03
Who the hell would keep 1200 BTC on an exchange... 
@_date: 2018-11-09 12:11:17
I'm all about BTC but I don't think the chances with alts are that slim... At least 10 alts performed better than BTC in 2018.
@_date: 2018-11-01 13:00:29
I would believe if it wasn't for this "we represent Satoshi Nakamoto". LMAO
@_date: 2018-11-09 12:14:21
You can't be serious... If it was in the first days ok, but now EVERYONE knows about that
@_date: 2018-11-09 12:33:49
But if I'm investing in alts I'm doing it in the top ones, I'm putting no money on Titcoin or Trollcoin... 
@_date: 2018-11-09 11:24:21
This sub is getting really bad
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:10:33

This sub is infested with terrible threads
@_date: 2019-01-22 11:02:50
Looks like reddit except that we are losing money.

You sound extremely ignorant.
@_date: 2018-11-13 15:32:41
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:37:23
See you in 30 minutes.
@_date: 2019-01-16 17:11:27
I was just fucking around, my post had no deep meaning at all. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:34:19
It was breached multiple times...
@_date: 2019-01-28 19:12:01
@_date: 2019-01-18 12:21:22
Lmao this is low
@_date: 2018-11-01 12:57:04
True. Give me 1 BTC for christmas please.
@_date: 2019-01-10 15:30:23
$470B in today's price is more than 124M BTC lol
@_date: 2019-01-08 13:37:57
A 51% attack haven't killed weak coins like VTC, ETC or BTG, why it would kill the king?
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:01:00
There's a lot of people happy with the downtrend actually.
@_date: 2018-11-13 11:46:13
Because there's always new blocks being mined
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:34:57
Man, I hate the "XBT" ticker.
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:07:22
@_date: 2019-01-30 15:22:41
Inb4 your shitcoin pumps 300%
@_date: 2019-01-16 15:46:48
If it does I'm filling my bags.
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:48:22
"PutinCoin to the moon"
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:39:20
Is Wayne into BTC now?
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:06:52
7.5 milli USD is irrelevant now...
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:49:15
This looks like how most of reddit do their trades.
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:42:53
How many bitches can I buy with 1 BTC?
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:46:32
Do you want the tech to stay forever the same?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:32:44
Early 
@_date: 2018-11-09 12:52:14
Yeah I know the problem with this word.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:21:37
If Carlos Matos gets any involved with this I'm buying a shit ton
@_date: 2018-11-06 14:07:26

@_date: 2017-10-31 22:14:59
Some say 30% of all 
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:31:50
BCHSV @  is a shame to the space.
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:26:15
You know shit is real when Binance starts lagging.
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:46:09
I've been hearing "oversold" for weeks. It makes no difference.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:22:08
If it hits $1500 they'll call for $150, then $15, then $1.50...
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:24:28
Just filled my bags with some BTCBSIAPWENFGPCP-QUENC474860
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:59:22
And I'm here hoping for only one :(
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:35:07
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:32:23
It's $0.0021 and 62 sats so it's not "worthless".
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:42:39
Those replies lmaoo
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:30:36
Doge will forever rule
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:18:00
Yeah, most people forgot why we started this. Greed and egos fighting took over the space. Of course that I want to make some money as well, but the tech and ideas behind crypto is just so beautiful.
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:51:37
Sorry, almighty dickers666 with a 3 month account. Please enlight me with your sublime knowledge.
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:23:27
The big players sell and cause panic so everyone starts selling
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:31:53
Then you miss the next bull run and when you come back it's in another bear market.
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:24:13
BCH MC is not exactly small
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:31:55
That's some expensive fapping
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:38:38
Only for the ones who can't do it.
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:35:25
What a huge green candle!!
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:39:01
Your order would take months to get filled, by then, BTC would be these prices at any exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:26:02
Some other night I had a dream that some alt I own pumped like 100000% and made me 20+ BTC lol
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:58:33
Lmfao that would be an awesome copypasta
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:29:46
I lot of shady stuff will happen for sure. I'm betting on a new fork named BTCLN.
@_date: 2018-12-03 11:25:07
Pump and dump at governmental levels.
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:17:37
And you took 10 years to realize that.
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:43:46
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:41:14
I don't like you.
