It occurred to me right after I logged off for the night that the blockchain.info balance info was more than likely returning satoshis.  I had checked cryptsy but forgot about that piece.  Sure enough, it was.  Thanks for help.  I might release the source when it gets further a long but it has a ways to go.

When I do a compatibility search on google market for galaxy s2 it comes up as compatible.  So I am not really sure.

I think there may be a library that is using higher versions of the android api, I'll have to double check.  It should be compatible with anything 3.0.x though and after.  The program itself is pretty decoupled from android so maybe there is something else I can do to lower the required version.

I don't think its on cryptsy's end, just checked the api response and its
So something broken on my end but for only BTC.. so I guess it was unexpected.  I can look into it more tomorrow and give an update.

If you have 2FA on and someone stole your shit you probably have a trojan on your PC or phone.  Make sure you don't save the session when you log into coinbase.  Virus scan with multiple scanners, and let us know if you come back clean or not.

Source code as in html or server side and/or was it publicly available? I'm curious if it was likely an inside job or anyone could have just scrapped the html page for the pw.  Or if the hacker used more dubious means to get the source.
Edit: Nvm, see it was answered below.

Hey, its still cool for me to know, so thanks.  It looked like when I submitted it, I had all the countries selected, but it actually only lists 135.  It doesn't show Georgia. There was a checkbox for "rest of the world" that was unchecked, that I just checked.  Maybe this will work.  It usually takes a few hours for changes to go through.

My average electric bill in the winter before I started mining was 140 dollars, now it is about 240 with 2 machines at 3.5 mh/s.  Granted I didn't run my heat till it was 83-87 degrees (Which is what it is when I have the windows closed).  My furnace didn't kick on the entire winter even when it was -20 outside...  This is only 6 cards, I can't believe how much heat the 7950s can put out.
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:09:50
Hmm, its case sensitive. I know its kind of a pain to manage now too.  
What I do is email to myself and copy then paste them into the app, but right now its only 1 at a time.  I think there also might be ways to launch a link into the app from email, so you could create the link on your PC then email it to your phone and click it and it would fill them in.
The QR thing is a good idea.  I'm also looking for ways to paste several addresses at once into the app, i got it mostly implemented I just need to fix a few things.

Not if you buy more BTC on Coinbase on a different account and used those... Well if you have instant buyout.
Or just buy them on coinbase on the same account and use LIFO(Last In First Out) for deductions.
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:54:52
It wouldn't.  People are greedy, if they just bought a fridge and suddenly the price of bitcoin doubles, they take it back and get back their BTC.  If it tanks to 1/2 and stays, they keep the fridge or sell it, or they wait a few months to see what the price does and then maybe return it.  This wouldn't ever be in the store's favor because there will always be more people who will take advantage of the system.  And since there is nothing apparently criminal going on, there is no way to reduce people abusing the system through deterrence of fraud or theft. If I had a business and accepted BTC no way would I give refunds in BTC if it has been more than a few days or the price has changed significantly.

Was funny.. I didn't really think it was real, but I definitely double checked the balance on the blockchain.  I had no problems with any other coin balances show up funny except BTC.  I think its because I use the API from cryptsy and it returns BTC to coin ratios and my app couldn't handle BTC to BTC for a reason I will be determining tomorrow = ).  The actual balance is 0.01918358 BTC
If anyone is curious -1.0 just means I don't have a blockchain hooked up to the currency to pull back livestats for the address yet.
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:57:51
You might want to be more specific, but there is an app I made that you can store all your public keys and get live balance updates.  You can also copy stored addresses and paste them into texts to send people.
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:01:00
What do you mean outside blockchain info?  I haven't really used blockchain info, but can you get the private key for the default address?  
So either
1) The thief logged into blockchain.info and got the private key and did the transfer else where.
2) The thief keylogged the private key which someone else retrieved and/or the password to blockchain.info.
Probably the same guy and was testing the waters at first.  I'd follow the first one the most because he was probably more risky.
Edit: Or.. if he couldn't get the private key from the address, either it only appears like he didn't use blockchain or blockchain was compromised.

I am not familiar with how the coinbase tipping works, but if the bot/person who gave the tip had the link, and redeemed it on accident, then it could give the issue as shown.  Or the wrong tip was given... (It was given to more than 1 person) Or there could be some trojan/vulnerability that is scanning for the links and redeeming them.. who knows.  But I would put blaming coinbase at the bottom of the list.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:24:10
Nope. If the token has been redeemed already, it probably has been redeemed already.  Do they need to provide you with info on who redeemed the token? Most customer support aren't going to have access to this info, and I'm sure they aren't going to spend much time on this issue. They know its been redeemed.  Its possible its an issue on their side, but as a developer myself, I think its really unlikely, and more likely that the bot operator is redeeming the tip links himself.
So.. its not coinbase's fault.. and you are giving them hell to squeeze blood from turnips.

Even with cold storage I wouldn't say your coins are exactly safe.  Someone has to move the files to cold storage.  How do we know they are trustworthy?  Coinbase can't guarantee that all their employers are 100% trustworthy.  How many people, when given the chance to steal millions of dollars with no repercussions or no way to trace it back to them would ignore this opportunity?  We don't know their detailed procedures for moving coins to cold storage, I think someone with enough knowledge and motivation could get away with quite a bit of coins before coinbase realized.  If people can get stuff out of the NSA I'm sure they could get stuff out of coinbase...

You mean all the mainframes that can so easily be converted to mine bitcoins and not perform their intended functions? /s
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:29:58
That wouldn't solve the problem of governments banning bitcoin... at some point you have to interface with a bank/service to go from fiat to bitcoin and vice versa, and that link can be severed.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:39:22
Are you sure the user who sent it was the coinbase bot? Looks like people get referrals for tips sent, I can see a lot of potential for phishing... if you fake out a tip (or use it for multiple people) and they sign up for a coin base account.

I just don't understand how any merchant would want to accept bitcoin ATM when the prices are so volatile.  A customer pays 1 btc for a computer at 2pm and at 8pm when you cash out its worth half of what it was worth earlier.  Seems like a much bigger risk for companies to take on, even given the benefit that they would save on credit card fees.
So if big merchants are hesitant because of volatile conversion rates, then the value of the currency is less. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 14:47:33
Curious to why this guy didn't go to coinbase in the first place?
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:15:56
You forgot how no transactions would go through, so people would start upping transactions fees to the point where it is at least break even with electricity costs for miners.  Plus people will mine at a loss if they expect the value to appreciate.

Meeting with someone in person with a large amount of cash and paying 10-20% more seems like more of a hassle to me.  But then again coinbase is 50btc limit so maybe this guy is putting down serious cash for BTC.

So, how much computing power would it take to get to 51%?  Are there any super computers around today that would be able to outpace the rest of the nodes?

Who is someone who is not me? The token is nothing more than an address for a transaction.  It doesn't have anything to say "this is me".  The first person to click the link and redeem it, would get the tip.  Say a person used the extension, sent a tip, went to their sent messages folder, and clicked the link, they would redeem it, not you.  Maybe they waited a day or so and saw you didn't redeem, so they did.
If you aren't giving them the token from the PM they have NO IDEA who was meant to be the recipient of the tip.  The URL doesn't contain any of that information, it just cares who clicks it first.

The more expensive/specialized hardware is necessary to confirm transactions, because the difficulty increases.  It makes it less likely the average person could ever mine bitcoin and have to purchase it instead.

99% being hoarded has huge repercussions in other ways besides the number of units being available for use.  When a significant portion of the hoarders stop hoarding, because of panic or europhia caused by X, it has massive consequences on the value of the currency for the average user.
The only way an average user could get around this would be to convert cash immediately to bitcoin then immediately to the merchant, then the merchant immediately converts it back to cash, and with how cumbersome this process is now (Been waiting 6 days for my Coinbase funds to be updated), this is not feasible.
What average consumer would want to take that much risk with a volatile currency (not to mention no insurance if you get hacked) when they could just use a credit card? There is really ZERO benefit for the average consumer to change from credit card/debit card to bitcoin, unless they want to remain anonymous or they aren't able to obtain a credit/debit card.  Financial motives for customers would have to apply, like giving them a 1-2% discount for using bitcoin, or stores would have to push it hard.  Which they won't until the currency is MUCH more user friendly.
I have zero need to use bitcoin for anything other than investment.  Hopefully the infrastructure and services get in place to make it more desirable for use as a currency vs an investment but it really has a long ways to go.

I think the message you received is pretty self explanatory.. The tip has been redeemed by someone already.  You mysteriously can't find the person who gave you the tip.  You should be asking them... because they probably redeemed it.  Coinbase support people might not have the tools available to easily track who redeemed which tips and are you even asking/explaining it well to them? Did you give them the URL or token you clicked?  They won't track every click for a tip that's already redeemed.

Yea right.. you mean the chinese can use computers to farm "actual" currency instead of WoW currency without the need for slaves? They will continue to mine regardless.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:28:33
Ok, sorry for the long drawn out discussion, but my first instinct for hearing like this is the user doesn't understand the problem (When I didn't understand all the behind the scenes details of the coinbase bot).  I would just keep persisting with the emails and be as descriptive as possible, and wondering if you could get an update, as with the take off of bitcoin this past week is probably really straining their customer service.  They couldn't expect 70% growth in customers in 2 days.  You might have better luck in a few weeks.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:56:34


This makes me not think its a problem with coinbase.. but someone actually claimed the tip before you did.
