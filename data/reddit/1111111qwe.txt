they were, at least it seemed that way to me

It is if I can convert them to something...maybe drugs.  As long as everyone is confident they will be able to trade them something they want it can have value, the community using them would probably shrink a whole lot though i would imagine

What are you expecting people to say?  Yes laws can hurt it potentially.  No one is capable of saying in what capacity though.  
My thoughts which have no backing are that worse case no legitimate business that pays taxes will be able to accept bitcoins, in countries that inact such laws at least. It will probably be a long time before majority of countries do, so there is still international purchases.  
Even without real businesses, person A can by something off of person B, person B will be more than happy to accept BTC as long as they are sure they can buy some other item off of person C for BTC, and the cycle continues.  There will always be person D willing to sell person C some kind of giftcard (or mail a cheque and/or cash) for BTC, allowing person C to sell the gift card for real money, and allowing person D to trade BTC for what they want.  And the cycle continues.
This is how i think bitcoin can survive while not being accepted by any legitimate businesses  
Unless of course all pools and exchanges get shut down, but like i said this requires a bunch of countries enacting laws.  And there will surely be a couple who dont.
