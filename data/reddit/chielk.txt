They mean people go grocery shopping on lightning but buy their house and car on the blockchain directly, so the amount of money (volume) transferred over blockchain is higher, but most transactions are on lighting.
I've don't really understand why they suggest that that's a problem. Unless I'm very mistaken, the goal of lightning has never been to make the blockchain obsolete, but to provide a fast and cheap alterative for payment that doesn't always need a transaction on the chain.

Yeah, it's a bit like when you spend money in a different country and you have to figure out how many zeroes to remove and then what to multiply or divide by. The fact that the value changes so much makes it so that it's like being in a different foreign country every time the market does something.

I'm pretty much a bitcoin noob, but from what I understand: Those fees are transaction (TX) fees for sending bitcoin from one place to another. What you are looking for are good conversion rates for AUD/BTC, which include TX fees but also whatever the exchange wants to charge.
It's not really what you are looking for, but something you may want to keep in mind when you move BTC from the exchange to your wallet etc.

I was also thinking maybe there should be names for units between a Bitcoin and a Satoshi. I thought 0.1 mBTC would be a good place to start for people who are used to units like Euro, Dollar, CHF, or Pound, but people in other places in the world may want to put the decimal somewhere else. When BTC moves another order of magnitude in value compared to fiat could use a different name for a different order of magnitude. I haven't decided yet if this would make it easier or harder.
