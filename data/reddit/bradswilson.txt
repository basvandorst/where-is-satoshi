Unsure why this is getting downvoted ... isn’t the whole point of bitcoin to bring on others who know nothing about it?

Agreed, an intermediary makes the most sense

Well said, very well said.

I think what gets forgotten or glossed over so frequently today is that politicians are “public servants”. 
They are supposed to serve the public.
If their campaigns are funded by Bitcoin advocates and the pressure is applied by us (private citizens), they will have no choice.

Wouldn’t this just create an arms race between all nations to better control the mining influence? Would that be beneficial to Bitcoin in the long run?

Right but doesn’t this create a situation where the major worldwide currency is something similar to what it is now? 
In this scenario Bitcoin wouldn’t be a sustainable revolution and it would be all of the same pro freedom, pro privacy individuals in a different “bitcoin” while the rest of the world is subject to centralization (AKA my grandma isn’t gonna switch to Dash once a major power co-opts Bitcoin and mutilates it).

I was thinking more of a transparency law requiring lawmakers and politicians to have their transactions publicly recorded.

It would be low hanging fruit to create some much needed transparency.
In a world where Bitcoin is ubiquitous, we are talking about a complete fundamental change in the power structure of society.
Who will be the people in power that can get these laws through?  
Once the public sees the potential to reduce corruption, what will the argument be as a politician to keep transparency reduced?

Bitcoin backed fiat ... Very interesting to think about.
I know it’s a ways away, but what do you think the incentive structure for bitcoin mining look like in the future (Think, there are no more bitcoins to mine)?
