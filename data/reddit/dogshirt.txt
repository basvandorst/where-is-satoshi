You do realize in court all of BFX's assets would be used to pay back creditors. Instead they have managed to allow only customers to realize losses and somehow made us think they have made a big sacrifice themselves.

If they drew from their own corporate bank balances to help cover the losses as opposed to just pinning it on customers then it seems likely that they could cover the remaining 36% and make their customers whole. After all, it was BFX that failed to secure the money, not the customers.

I agree there should be a bitcoin-pegged BFX coin and a USD-pegged BFX coin that can be traded back and forth

Here's the quote:
"You can use digital currencies in the paypal digital wallet, that's in fact what PayPal is doing is building a digital wallet that can take multiple types of currencies." - John Donahue, CEO of eBay.
You read that Paypal is a digital currency in here?

This is the best news for Bitcoin I've heard in 2014 so far.

How does Bitcoin make this possible? And is a lightning fast under the hood payment exclusive to bitcoin? Sounds like the reason why Apple Pay was invented.

I'm glad our man Matt pushed him for this quote

Most accurately I could have said "this is good news for me, with regard to my interest in the growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem." 
This news is relevant to anybody that has interest in widespread adoption of Bitcoin, not just "future purchasers". 
Regarding your last question- why would I care about "future purchasers" perceiving this as good news? That's easy. Adoption. BTC economy grows, my bitcoins are worth more, etc. 
What is the point of your post?

He says both digital currencies and multiple *types* of currencies. Fiat is one type of currency and includes $, euro, gbp, etc. Clearly there will be digital currencies in the wallet that are not simply digital forms of fiat currencies. What these digital currencies will be is up for speculation.

Until he demonstrates any kind of understanding of the underlying tech, speculating on his understanding is pointless.. Unless you prefer argument by authority for its own sake.

At the bottom of satoshi's profile you can "follow" his activity::

Nope. No reason why OP can't voice his frustration, AND take his business elsewhere.

Did you read the article? 
[SecondMarket announced a Bitcoin exchange in February]( a platform for *trading*- that they hope to launch by Q2
SecondMarket also just announced today they will be opening the Bitcoin Investment Trust to public investors- which will be similar to the Winklevii's ETF except it won't be traded on the NYSE. They are looking to launch this by Q4
The Bitcoin trading exchange and the Bitcoin Investment Trust fund are separate investment vehicles that serve different purposes.

Serious question- why would using Bitcoin add any extra benefit to transacting with an autonomous taxi service? It could just as well use the swipe of a credit card or an (NFC-like) Apple Pay payment. 
I'm a Bitcoin supporter but I fail to see how Tesla's new technology has anything to do with a new killer application for Bitcoin.

Who are you talking to? 
Also.. why are you limiting your skepticism to just governments? You oughta apply that same skepticism across the board. Including bizarre, unfalsifiable stories you read online-- even if they fit into your anti-government narrative. 
(for the record I am skeptical of governments and bizarre, unfalsifiable stories online)
