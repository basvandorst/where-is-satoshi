“As long as we have electricity and internet, we will have bitcoin, only when those die, will digital currency die” what you meant to say was FIAT currency dies very quickly.

Would people stop valuing gold... if... all were mined from earth? No. It would still be valuable, as well as used as a means of exchanging value.

Not necessarily more guesses per second... but also larger guesses which if you use old equipment don’t even have the “brain” power to guess that high right off the bat... or enough time to start guessing lower numbers than learning to successively guess larger more difficult numbers. Which is what happens when you actually mine. They start guessing smaller numbers then bigger and bigger but the old machines like s1’s will never ever ever guess the new large difficulty  numbers. Which is why most miners mine on pools so they get reimbursed for their Mining power and time, yet in no way will their machines ever guess the number.

No more coins to mine? Bitcoin will be mined until 2140... and then all the currency will be distributed at that point and the exchange of value will continue on... not stop... once all the currency of 21 million bitcoins are released. Please go read the Bitcoin white paper if you have not already.
