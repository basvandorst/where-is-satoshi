Threads like this are why the real traders are salivating to trade the futures on Sunday.  If your understsanding is that it has to go back up always, you are going to lose alot once the futures launch.

buy high, sell low a few times, and the remaining you are still holding need to go up alot more than where you bought them at to break even.

You should still pay taxes to be safe, but if you want to chance it, it is pretty unlikely they would come after you for it.  Not enough man power to investigate small transactions.  More likely you would get audited from cheating somewhere else, and then they would see your btc profits and make you pay back taxes/fines on that money as well.

No.  Just like any asset, you pay taxes on capital gains.  So until you sell, there is no tax obligation.  If you sell in less than 1 year from purchase, you must pay short term capital gains tax on your profit (this is taxed at your normal income level %).  If you sell in more than 1 year from purchase, you must pay long term capital gains which is currently taxed at 15%, unless your yearly income gets you into the 39.6% tax bracket, then you must pay 20%.

When big firms are paying teams of traders 6-7 figures each to trade crypto, who do you think is going to win?  The guys who understand markets, go to trading classes, have a history of making money trading, are getting paid alot to make money for their firms, etc, etc, etc, or some bozos yelling hodl and posting memes?  Fish in a barrel is a drastic understatement.

lol you know what you just described is exactly how stocks work right?  


@_date: 2018-02-05 23:25:01
lol this is the worst logic ever.  Lets say you have a stock that was $1 and now it is $.01.  And you have a second stock that is $1000 and drops to $998.  Which is a more significant drop?  The stock that lost 99% of its value, or the stock that lost more dollars than the other stock, but is only down .2%?

Except you clearly dont understand.  But keep thinking everyone else is wrong and you are right... that kind of logic almost always proves correct!
