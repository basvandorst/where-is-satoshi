a lot of large outlet businesses don't even know that they are being juked by their own embellishments!

didn't Cyprus run with only bitcoin for a while?

aside from reasonable suspicion.
would it be reasonable suspicion for me to drink a bottle of spring water since, well, terrorists like to drink water too!
mentioning bitcoin to your banker should not prompt them to do anything but smile and nod, or frown, but they can't not cash your check or disallow anything
it's equally reasonable for them to say "I didn't allow your currency to go to person X because I don't like the color shoes you were wearing yesterday"
sue these dick nuggets or at least don't do business with them

in order for there to be money laundering there has to be illegal activity
writing "BITCOIN" on a piece of paper  does not equate to illegal activity
I would be surprised if there are bankers out there who don't pass up on an opportunity to slow their own demise.

it's not money laundering without illegal activity.  not even reasonable suspicion is enough to prove that money was laundered you need actual proof
no, hence the phrase 
lawyer up and sue!


show me a "bank contract that forbids bitcoin"  and i will then consider this a sane argument, not that I would EVER consider it sane even if it existed.
