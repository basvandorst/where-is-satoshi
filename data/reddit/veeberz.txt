Try em with different derivation paths, I suppose. These seeds could generate many privK+pubK pairs. :(
Edit: Also note that Electrum wallets use their own standard for mnemonic seeds.
Edit 2: Use BIP49.

BTC wallets don't really "exist" in the way you think until there's a transaction involving them.

479 billion. Yeah I suppose

[Another Python script](
This one takes a list of seed phrases (e.g. "problem proof attack end ability find sign post know fee entire since") delimited by a new line, and it generates BIP 49 addresses with the derivation path `m/49'/0'/0'/0/x`. Change `MAX_ADDR_IDX` to change the last digit of the derivation path `m/49'/0'/0'/0/x`. The script will check all of such x up to `MAX_ADDR_IDX`. Defaults to 0 only (`m/49'/0'/0'/0/0`).
If you want to test your best, educated guesses and have less than a thousand candidates, you may want to change `MAX_ADDR_IDX` to a larger number. Maybe 25? 256? But if you assume the key was generated using default parameters and you're employing a spray-and-pray technique (good luck), just leave it alone.
When found, it writes the seed phrase and BTC private key to `found.txt`.
Edit: This script assumes no additional passphrases were used. Boy, wouldn't that be a PITA? It's possible that a passphrase is used. It's also possible that this whole thing is a hoax. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
Edit 2: Try this if you're getting a module error (can't find electrum):
    sudo pip3 install

Whoops, I uploaded it after I've prepared it publishing and made a minor error that made a huge difference. Thanks for the heads up.
The problem was the deriveAddresses function. Wasn't suppose to put a tick at the end. The last node of the derivation path should not have been hardened.

Good luck!

Yup this requires the electrum package. Might need to Google it. Not sure if it's on the repo.

Thank you! That was driving me nuts.
Now all I need to do is guess the seed phrase. Should be easy! /s

k &lt;= 7
Inside the letter o in the word block

Yeah but that'll take 12! tries
