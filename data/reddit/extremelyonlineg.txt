If you hate fiat then you should hope bitcoin remains stable instead of fluctuating wildly. If your just speculating then everything you just said is retarded.
...basically no matter what your motivation this is just pure cringe.

\&gt; blockchain is just a slow database
Computer, what is distributed consensus?

I think it's funny that y'all think that this person got rich from bitcoin when the overwhelming majority of rich bitcoiners are just wealthy people with a bitcoin hobby.

\&gt; implying there aren't literally thousands of reasons for BSV to crash and burn aside from this

Dominance has eroded spectacularly over the past year.
....or do you mean we should also ignore eroding dominance stats?

Why are a bunch of sub 100 karma accounts astro-turfing all the crypto subs with this article?
@_date: 2019-01-08 21:15:48
I had to get a new account because my old one got banned for pinging someone.
I also have more karma than you and a completely open and organic post history, so suck me.


Nothing, I have a problem with inorganic and fake news being spread for a reason I don't know.

Download RES and you can get an account summary by hovering your cursor over the name.

\&gt; ignore the price
\&gt; ignore the mempool
\&gt; ignore the fundamentals of the whitepaper
\&gt; ignore the fact that other chains are easily scaling block size
Anything else we should be ignoring?

Co-ordinated posting of articles to fake virality or interest.
When a corporation or other entity wants to make it seem like there is grassroots interest in an idea they will use astro-turfing techniques to make it seem like the idea is spreading due to popular support.

\&gt; these are greentext/4chan style right arrows
\&gt; idn why I prefer them but i do

This is inane.
...so if bitcoin works for specifically you, once a week on a specific item, its a currency?
ok then....

TIL clicking on a poster's history and seeing that a 6 year account with 50,000 karma only has 2 comments is called "analysis".

In what possible universe is an asset price plotted on a logarithmic scale? How is that useful?
This is embarrassing.
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:05:01
\&gt; volatile asset
\&gt; actively in development, with major changes, forks, etc
\&gt; obviously can't even predict what the price will be next month
\&gt; thinks he can predict next decade
Why do people even post this shit?
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:39:48
Why did you delete your entire posting history today?
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:16:20
Yep, this is trash.
Gentlemen, to the downvote button!

"I really wish Canada would stop scamming people by calling their currency 'dollars', it really confuses people who are trying to pay me in USD"
If you're using software so old it lets you send BCH to a BTC address maybe crypto isn't for you?
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:49:09


What do you mean by this? Bitcoin is a trust*less* system.


This is nonesense. Bitcoin can not justify a 7,000 valuation just because one day people might use it for smart contracts.
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:37:35
I'm pretty sure that bitcoin was made to be a currency, and derives a lot of it's valuation based on the notion that it is a currency.
If it's just an asset why have micro-payments, distributed ledgers, wallets....
You could just make it a central, exchange traded asset. At that point it would just be an ETF that doesn't actually invest in anything.
