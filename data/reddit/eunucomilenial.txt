Haha I'm literally writing from Argentina. You're the ignorant moron. How many hiper inflation process have you lived? How many times have you seen a coup d'etat? I have literally seen the president escape from the rage of the people in helicopter when the economy crashed in 2001, with my own eyes, not on TV. I have visited Caracas, twice. I have seen the military police of Nicaragua with my own eyes beating down protestors. 
 And see the economy crash again with the Macri buffoon. You really are a armchair bullshitter. I have been in person to Ecuador Bolivia Panama Venezuela Costa Rica Paraguay Perú Honduras Guatemala too...

Buddy, the ex vice president of Argentina was convicted for literally printing money, like real paper money.... He had purchased a machine. Google Boudu Chicone Calcografica

Haha you're delusional... Argentina is printing money like there is no tomorrow... The ex vice president was condemned to prison because the guy literally had a printing money machine for his personal use... Google Chicone Calcografica. The peso went down like 900% in only ten years... And 100% in just some months... And bolívares is literally less valuable than toilet paper... Do a reality check, you're delusional if you think they aren't printing money. They don't outsource it. They literally have the printing machines working 24/7

the money in those countries is worse than toilet paper, people prefer to store whatever instead of pesos or bolivares or whatever other shitty fake money those failed governments are printing

Like cash? If you don't have physical contact, is not prostitution... Hundred dollar bills stuffed in her ass is the way to pay
