Now is a good time to buy bitcoin. All the plebs will buy when it surpasses the all time high.

I think so. Still, if you get liquidated for 50mil and used 100x leverage, thats still 500k down the drain LOL
@_date: 2019-11-05 11:52:50
Shorts getting liquidated, just now 35mil long position got liquidated aswell. wtf is happening
Edit:still keeps happening, it hasnt stopped, huge whales getting liquidated

Thats why I love Monero the most out of the altcoins. It's privacy focused. Bitcoin will still be the greatest storage of value and a great investment for long term

I don't know if it's manipulation by whales, an exchange or some glitch. Weird

Do I have to live in those countries or can I just be there for a little while, withdraw the money and then go back?

It might be bitmex, but it doesn't show the exchange for those big orders. I have every exchange possible on that site turned on, so it could be any of em. Bitmex would make sense though, since it has the most volume

Lol I tried to go to that website and my country has blocked it due to illegal gambling law of some sort. Usually my country is pretty laid back on these things wtf :D

The mined bitcoin supply will drop to half. Around may 2020 it will go from 12.5btc to i believe 6.175 btc. Less coins mined, less supply, more demand, higher prices.
Edit:yea sorry my bad 6.25, i read the wrong number somewhere.

Haha what the fuck boomer

It's there for trading and increasing your possible position on a trade, not for withdrawal.

Dude I just saw something eat up all the liquid on Coinbase from Bookmap.
edit: it was terrifying
@_date: 2019-10-01 10:38:18
Lol it has played out so far from since you published it. How'd you do it? Did you just take a brush and draw it or did you have some strategy behind it
@_date: 2019-10-24 19:53:17
So you're the motherfucker who dumped the market. Bought the BTC to 50X leverage short it on exchanges. That edit was probably him realizing he had more power than he thought.
This is one hardcore motherfucker.

I see it as a pro, because it allows for great market analysis and good trades. I don't see the volatility going away ever, because there are limited amounts of bitcoin and people who hold a huge amount of them will be able to move the market price very easily.

Big whales are accumulating at these levels! Don't let this Christmas sale fool your emotions! Above ATH next year almost guaranteed
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:06:13
Honestly, there a lot of Bitcoin bears in that sub. I don't know why they are there if they think like that...
@_date: 2019-12-09 06:08:19
I trust Coinbase the most out of the other main exchanges, their fees are a bit high but luckily if you want to swap usd to btc and vice versa, you can do it relatively cheap on gdax with a limit order.

yeah it's fucked. many are just selling shit on runescape for real life money and they make more than normal workers.
