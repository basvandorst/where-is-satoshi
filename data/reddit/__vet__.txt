**real recognizes real.** the smartest and most experienced guys in the room are long Bitcoin (even if diversified in other coins).
Bitcoin is an open source project. all the utxo alts are great as testnets. but ultimately Bitcoin will just implement what has been tested **and works** by others. no other coin is nearly as decentralized as bitcoin. decentralization is the whole point for this type of medium of exchange. fees will come down because the spammers can't afford it after segwit and the already begun implementation of LN (whether the activity was genuine economic activity or not). 
for any pegging, why peg to a weaker network when you can peg to the most secure network?
if an economic use case for non-medium of exchange decentralized tokens can be found, then other alts will have value.  gas for a decentralized computer (not necessarily the first version of it) for example has  good economic use case, but i wont name others because this is @_date: 2018-01-03 16:16:04

When you stand up for yourslef as a hodler, you are really standing up for all hodlers.  They can break any one of us individually.  But they can never break a united, resolute community. It is the only system that has truly been able to stand the test of time. Empires rise and fall. Dedicated groups with a strong central mission can last. Its a long game, we are in inning 1.
Take whatever avenues you personally believe in and stand up for Bitcoin. Its worth it. And thank you to all that do.

if you send directly from an exchange to someone else, it would be difficult for the receiver to tie it back to you (they would be able to tell it came from the exchange if they did some chain analysis). the exchange would obviously know it came from you

well one of the most repeated things (and frequently stickied is):  don't invest more than you can lose., so that inherently promotes life needs over Bitcoin and also promotes diversification as Bitcoin increases in price
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:13:29
If you are 55 to 85 years old and you put 1% of your net worth into Bitcoin, you should HODL.  
Now if you investment becomes 30% of your net worth whether they are bitcoins or tech stocks, you should consider selling some (depending on your needs) to diversify your portfolio.  That does **not** violate hodling.  Hodling is an approach to investing in Bitcoin, not a mandate to never sell as your life / portfolio needs change.
For example, some older people that have really killed it in the tech space.  Becoming spectacularly wealthy during the tech boom (more money than they ever made working). They would be foolish not to diversify. 
If you have 30 years and you want to buy a house to live in and you have been hodling bitcoins but no other form of currency for a long time.  Obviously you should sell some and buy a house.  Again, that doesn't violate hodling.
Hodling is an approach to investing in bitcoin, not cultish devotion thing regarding all of your wealth.

EDIT:  I am just emphasizing that forums where participant are known is very important.  Only because many Bitcoin detractors are financially incentivized to do so, as a result they post endlessly the same arguments. Many of them illogical.  They can only persist because they rely on anonymous forums.  See educated, known people discussing Bitcoin, and you will never see them making arguments that making Bitcoin bears on reddit make.

Speculating on alternative assets can still be massively positive Expected Value and can have good non-correlative impacts on an individual's portfolio.  If you have an asset that has the capability to go up 10x or 100x, you need to give it a serious look.  As even just 2% chance of going 100x and 98% going to 0 in every other scenario makes it an amazing buy.

Many  of the largest addresses are the cold storages of large Bitcoin businesses.  Since many people do "store" their Bitcoins on things like CB, it is tough to know how many **actual** bitcoin users there are (or at least they think they own Bitcoins).

This is very far from fact.  It is for sure true with certain assumptions and parameters. It is just widely spread by Western economists because it gives policymakers a big reason to pay economists a lot and for them to be involved in policy decisions.
Many economies throughout history relied solely on fixed supply currency and they experienced amazing periods of growth, innovation, and technological advancement.

@_date: 2017-12-18 06:09:56
well things were much different back then.  key thing is that the volumes on the exchanges are way more distributed now.  Back then MTGOX was THE exchange.  Its price was the most important price and all other exchanges followed it (like Bitstamp and BTC-E were the key secondary exchanges).  Just like CB failing to handle the volume today, its website would frequently crash during frenzies which could induce a panic sell event. very few called the top back then

No, its not "bad" because coins flowing from weak hand strong hands is an inevitable part of the process that has been going on since Day 1.  It is an inevitable part of the process, and it is neither "good" nor "bad."
Weak hands flooding into crypto to find a get-rich-quick-scheme, will almost always lose their money.  Its sad, we try to warn them, but its a truth.  The FUDers are very proficient and they will cause them to panic. I have seen it too many times now.

The person / group of people want the price to go down for their own personal financial gain.  Generally 1 of 2 things are true:

yes, also there are a substantial amount of people with large short positions on Bitcoin.
Unfortunately people in finance sometimes use some incredibly scummy tactics when they have short positions. For example,  Chanos, a notorious and renowned short seller, has established an extremely large position on TESLA.  He is **allgedly** a large part of the funding behind many of the affirmative action related lawsuits, etc. (some other scummy stuff, but that is just a recent example. I don't believe Chanos would do that tho, but maybe some other shorters with the same position).

@_date: 2017-12-17 23:39:42
You misunderstand several things IMHO. It could very well be to misinformed users posting on these forums. 
1. HODL is about NOT daytrading.  That is what the original post is about. It is about not being manipulated by the exchanges and whales.  You should still definitely sell when you have life needs! Or if Bitcoin appreciates quite a bit and you have responsibilities (i.e., loved ones, dependents, pets, etc.), then of course you should diversify .  That does not violate hodling at all.
2. There is no issue at all with old hands cashing out.  Not a threat at all.  The issue is that when alt coin shills flood the forums (not this one as it actually has good mods, but with many other online forums they flood in with various accounts, purchased accounts, hacked accounts and make it seem like the sky is falling and Bitcoin is doomed.  Just go look at what was posted during Bitcoin Cash's first major TX spam attack).  So in combination with all their coordinated FUD, spam attacks, and deluge of "old hands" selling, the newbies panic sell at a loss.  Eventually they realize their mistake and generally buy back in.  But its jut a dirty trick that once you have seen it enough times, it starts to piss you off. There are plenty of people on blogs, youtubers, etc. that have fallen victim to these con artists. 


The value of money, like all things, is inherently subjective.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:46:30

@_date: 2017-12-04 23:15:18
Yes, there are most definitely storms to come.  Now that people can reliably short, we will see a true, **serious** FUD attack.  Many people dancing around, high-fiving, talking about their "hodling" right now will panic sell at a much lower price.  They will be very upset at us.  I try to tell them now about this, but I am not sure that they know what they are getting into.
Don't forget:  you can support Bitcoin without hodling!  But if you are going to invest in Bitcoin, I highly recc that you only do so you have researched extensively and you think there is a high probability it is capable of what **you think** it is capable of.

@_date: 2017-12-08 01:47:36
Fair enough on the price POV, but for me:


This is just very bad advice for that group IMHO.  A dip is certainly possible.  I don't 'think likely in the short term, but it is 100% possible.  If you have made meaningful gains to your life, consider diversifying.  Capitalism tends to create bubbles, i have seen many in my life time now.  Even transformative technologies like the internet, the railroad, etc. tend to bubble. I have known many people waste or recklessly gamble fortunes thinking they could always beat the market.  Its not a pleasant experience.
But by what attribute of Bitcoin do you think disqualifies it as a commodity though?  Whichever hardfork you choose, the tokens are commodities.
define Commodity from google:
a raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee;
a useful or valuable thing, such as water or time.

thats an absurdly misleading statement TBH. i do agree it is right though, but so many dust trxns have been sent throughout bitcoin's history for various reasons (sometimes to encode messages on the blockchain). right now != forever. These attacks are expensive, they can only maintain them for so long.  Eventually they will get mined and the mempool will get eaten down again. i am sure of it.
but in any case, its important that the network doesn't just bow to the demand of attackers (even if the attackers are the miners themselves).  we can't put the entire project at risk just due to some well-heeled attackers making  a lot of noise.

if its a large amount: hire a CPA.  he can help you tax planning not only for crypto, but also for your entire life (especially relevant due to tax reform). I have used the same CPA for the past 15 years, it is some of the highest returns i have ever seen on a purchase.

Well honestly if Bitcoin is truly co-opted by a group you don't agree with (be it banks, drug dealers, whatever depending on your viewpoint), then you simply sell your Bitcoins at an immense profit and move on to a new project.  It is not a death blow by any stretch.  In fact gives you more resources to pursue your objectives, whatever they may be.

It is way riskier than you are imagining.  Defending a long position is way easier.  The shorter can only dump their coins once. For sure is possible.  But just remember, for each shorter, there is someone on the long side on the CME. Also teh shorter has to post to a huge amount of collateral.

This logic is beyond retarded. If CB sells you for a certain price, and you agree to buy, **IT IS IRRELEVANT HOW MUCH CB BOUGHT IT FOR YOU IF THEY DELIVER AT THE AGREED UPON PRICE**.  They did exactly what they said, what they paid for the Bitcoin is irrelevant in the agreed upon transaction.

your BCH is not gone. you should still be able to redeem them with a Bitcoin Cash wallet. 
 i dont have enough experience (and there are a lot of rumors that many of the BCH wallet downloads have viruses inserted into the distribution package. a lot of users reported getting their BTC stolen right after redeeming BCH, but its tough to know the truth cuz a lot of misinformation here. i redeemed mine with an old laptop that was destined for the trash bin so i wasnt too worried. )

Counterparty risk is jsut the risk that CB takes your coins in some manner.

Coinbase is like a broker. They make it simple: they quote you the price and give you the coin.  GDAX is a trading platform. It is supposedly aimed at "professional traders."  Really its aimed at professionals, institutional investors, and attracting newbies to try their  hand at trading.  Trading is just like gambling for many newbies that do not know what they are doing. And like a casino, eventually the houses vig (in this case the GDAX fees and potentially whale traders), will eat the minnow alive. 
In any case, you can use it to get better fee execution for your buys and sells (0% fee on limit orders).  Just be ware of trying to make "easy money" trading...

Just be sure you read a bit about US securities law before launching your ICO / promoting alt-coins. They seem to be OK with some approaches but for those thinly traded coins:
"I also caution market participants against promoting or touting the offer and sale of coins without first determining whether the securities laws apply to those actions. Selling securities generally requires a license, and experience shows that excessive touting in thinly traded and volatile markets can be an indicator of “scalping,” “pump and dump” and other manipulations and frauds"

A coin's value definitely does depend on the security of the network and the community behind it.  Bitcoin is just as much an economic and social experiment as it is a tech experiment.  The people behind the other cryptos just focus on bashing Bitcoin instead of working on their own movements because Bitcoin and its integrated software will eventually eat most of the alt-coins.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:26:38
Nobody knows.  That is the honest truth. Everyone else is just pushing their personal, financial agenda. 
Personally I think people are responding to the FUD and fearmongering related to the futures. (I have worked in finance for some time, i am 100% confident no one would be as foolish as to stake their career on shorting Bitcoin in size.  So many things can go wrong, including getting your position liquidated but still end up being right (a real risk when shorting)). 
I think a bunch of people got out now due to the futures, and they will get in after they realize they had no idea what they were talking about.
But if it is causing  you a lot of anxiety and stress, I would diversify.  It never hurts to take some profits along the way.   You don't have to sell it all.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:03:34
gotcha. no one will fault you for exiting your position. you would exit your trade and it would be a very profitable trade.
also consider you don't have to sell all of them.  but, yes, there will be a very heavy FUD attack on media channels, social media, internet forums, etc. for at least the next week or so.  If you can't stomach something like that, you might want to bail now (the attacks may or may not be effective, depending on the conviction of the current holders).
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:36:51
100% agreed. But examining all of the avenues available to the longers and shorters is very necessary in an analysis of the impact of the Futures.  We can't just only look at the Futures market in isolation.

If Bitcon and blockchain systems completey replaced fiat and legacy systems, it would be far more energy efficient.


First, empirical evidence:  See price, transaction volume, and mempool.  A huge percentage of the 7.4 billion people in the world have a use For Bitcoin.  Just because in the USA we may not doesn't mean no one does.


No, its value comes from other people willing to accept Bitcoin for goods or services.


Do not undrestand this point.  Bitcoin is just a network, an open source protocol.  It is not trying to creat eany sort of "playing field."  the world is deeply unjust.  Bitcoin doesn't solve that.


Are you suggesting that an individual who purchased  Bitcoins in 2009 - oct 2017 didn't profit massively?  Never go full retard.


Thats your opinion.


Dude, seriously?  It is a fking open source project.  There is a white paper that explains it very well and clearly.  If you can't understand htat, you really need to just focus on your job and stay the fuck away from Bitcoin.

  &gt;It’s a ponzi.
Definition form Wikipedia: A Ponzi scheme (/'p?n.zi/; also a Ponzi game) is a fraudulent investment operation where the operator generates returns for older investors through revenue paid by new investors, rather than from legitimate business activities or profit of financial trading.
Bitcoin is a decentralized, open source system. No one has control over it. As such, there is no "operator" that can engage in the fraud necessary to sustain a Ponzi. Therefore Bitcoin cannot be a Ponzi.

The closest equivalent would be a fork.  WHen forked, you get the same tokens on the "new ledger" equal to the amount of coins you had on the original Bitcoin. (another advantage to owning Bitcoin).

Tough to know for certain, but BitFlyer did start rocketing up around 8 AM Tokyo time (4th largest exchange by volume).  They are currently leading by a good bit (typical during the recent rallies).  It was around CBOE as well, but CBOE volume has been pretty low, so am inclined to believe it is BitFlyer / Korean exchanges really pushing this.

Don't trade. It is very complex and takes a long time to get good through a combination of: theoretical study, study of empirical evidence, and real life experience of the stress involved. Some of the smartest people in this world are recruited straight from undergrad and dedicate themselves to the science and art of trading.  Now previously you were limited by your body.  Now with computers, 1 trader can multiply his moves dramatically through all sorts of mechanisms. 
Now, there are plenty of newbies too and you only need to be better than the "average trader" theoretically (based on volume and less in certain corner cases).  But aside all that, just don't trade.
Use GDAX to make your buys &amp; sells and use cold storage. Hodl until you have life needs for spending. (Hodl for over 1 year to get capital gains rate if applicable for your country).

you have found yourself a potential arbirtrage opportunity.  here is what you must consider:
1. What is the final profit for each unit of trade, NET OF ALL FEES!  How much is 1 unit relative to the overall volume in the respective markets?  What size can I expect to see?
2. How long to execute the whole trade? Can the price move quickly enough to eliminite the arb beore you can close your position?
3. How much capital must be employed for the trade?  What is my opportunity cost on that capital (i.e., would i be better off if i didn't pursue the arb and instead invested in the S&amp;P 500?)
4. What ohter risks do you have to bear to enter the arb? For example, will I have to bear quite a bit of new counterparty risk with a new exchange?  What is the exchange's reputation and history? Whats the overall risk?
After you evalute these factors, you can decide wehther or not the arb is worth it.

Bitcoin is the most secure and that is its key selling point.  Just look at node count. We **cannot** compromise the newtork's security.  For the greater good of the cryptomovement.  Even if other alt-coins want to come in, trick some newbies, hurt the Bitcoin community. Benefit by filing up the mempool and promoting their pump-n-dump coins, there is only so much we can do. we just have to kind of let them to an extent.  they will always just copy and paste the code that took so much time and energy from such an incredible group of devs that are building the Bitcoin infrastructure (i am not tlakng about 6 or 7, or even 8 guys, i am talking about the 10,000+ people across this globe that have worked on Bitcoin projects. 
But I am sorry. I cannot advocate bending to their demands.  We just have to keep the network secure, keep it safe from attackers.  Even if in the short term it hurts profits. We need to keep the network secure. I actually do advocate bigger blocks, but it must be done through a transparent process that leads to social consensus.

People also completely ignore that anyone participating in the Futures market (including shorters) need to post 44% collateral on the CBOE.  that is HUGE.  People do not realize the impact this has on shorting decisions.  This is not just buying some put options.  
You have to not only know that Bitcoin will go down, you also have to know **when**.  (Otherwise your position could get margin called / your supervisor decides he was totally an idiot to listen to you and forces you to exit the trade anyway).  No one that makes big decisions related to commodities trading got their position through cryptocurrencies.

Yes exactly.  It definitely can't be a currency until it has a much, much greater market cap.  Once there are a good amount of closed loop economic systems utilizing bitcoin, it will eventually, effectively become a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:54:06
Yes, we all want to scale. Every single crypto will have the same problem (or the same problems **and** more problems) as Bitcoin if they reached its level of use. I agree that there is no "spam" on the network.  A valid transaction is a valid transaction.  If you bid enough for block space and a miner puts it in, go for it.  
However, its very clear there was a large number of transactions, most likely sent (can't be certain), at a low Satoshi level (and higher), to purposefully elevate the mempool.  This did a couple of things for the miners:
 1. Coincided with social media and media FUD attack 1a: CNBC interviews with known felons (very unusual for CNBC) 1b: Citibank's statement, 1c: "Found of bitcoin.com says Bitcoin is dead!" spam on a bunch of MSM
 2. Raised the average fee for legitimate users panicking: benefit to the miners 2a: see chained transactions instantly sent to the next address. It is not impossible for these to have an economic purpose.  But for them to grow in such a large amount, at the same time as everything else, its pretty obvious what the intent is. If you want to close your eyes to that, you can. I don't care.
 3. Allowed them to promote competitor coins, which still allows them to cheat at mining through various methods (ASICBoost, participating in a mining pool and using the data as an advantage, etc. If you aren't technical they are tough to understand, but they definitely do exist). 3a: 
There are a ton more examples but people need to do their own research. So there is no "panic," there is no "crisis." Without this FUD and all the contrived transactions designed to incite panic and fear, Bitcoin would be totally fine (not to mention it will be even better when people start using SegWit).

No.  If miners left, difficulty would adjust downward until GPU mining would be profitable again.  Difficulty always adjusts whether we turn on a lot more hashing power or whether we turn off.  The price really dictates how much hashing power is deployed though.

Yes, I was deeply skeptical about Bitcoin for 9 months. I studied and studied, thought there must be a "gotcha" somewhere.  The more I researched, the more I realized I was just simply mistaken.  All of my intuition was wrong.  Thankfully I was able to admit i was mistaken and act accordingly.

The real Harolds are probably BitcoinIRA guys.  Us old guys know how that paying attention to tax efficient planning is important. And it is actually a pain to sell any of my BitcoinIRA stuff. In part due to the minimums to ensure proper service. The minimum to open an account was $100k back when I signed  up.
But that is why I know they are some of the strongest hodlers out there. To all the Harolds out there, thank you!

This round of media and social media assault was particularly severe.  It definitely feels we reached the "then they fight you" stage.

Yes, all value is subjective to some degree.  Bitcoin is just like any other object.
What gives Bitcoins their value is their attributes:  can be sent any time, anywhere, without asking for any sort of permission whatsoever, can be stored with 12 words, cannot be seized by any sort of authority, etc.

The key thing you are missing, is that there can be no **net** shorters.  For every shorter, there will be a counterparty that is long for the exact same size.  They will be incentivized to push the price UP. and they might have more ammo than the shorter. Shorting is actually quite expensive becuase you need to post a lot of collateral.  That collateral would be better used as in investment, but you are just risking it on a bet.  I think most shorters will really be miners (just as most people that want to establish a futures market are the producers of the product.  they are hte primary benefeciaries of being able to go short in a cash settled futures market).
From a post earlier today:
1. BTC is not actually traded with Futures on CBOE/CME
2. Future is a contract between 2 people. 1 Person takes a long position, the other takes a short position.
3. Shorting BTC would involve borrowing BTC and selling it to buy it back later to return the BTC to the person you borrowed it from. Futures do not involve borrowing BTC or selling/buying any BTC.
This means, any amount put into future contracts will not affect the supply or demand of the underlying asset. If I somehow put $1 Trillion into shorts, I would own 0 BTC's. I would just have $1 Trillion in opposite position of $1 Trillion of someone who is long.
People are saying Banks/Wallstreet are buying BTC so they can get some short positions and sell their BTC holdings to make profit on the short futures. I find this ridiculous, as these Banks/Wallstreet traders who want to go short will need to find other Banks/Wallstreet traders to go the long at the same rate. Both parties have equal incentive to see the price go both ways. This is why volatility is generally reduced with futures.
Additionally, the people who benefit most from future contracts would be BTC miners. They will be protected against the drop in price before they can sell BTC to pay for electricity.
Mainly these futures will be used as insurance against people who want to buy or sell BTC incase they make the wrong decision.

haha 100%. it is actually kind of nice that Bitcoin was birthed in a heavy FUD environment and basically attacked from all sides from Day Zero.  It made sure the original hodlers were the types able to stomach all sorts of attacks without panicking. 
Also now "they" can't coordinate an media attack against Bitcoin, because the default status is to hate on and attack Bitcoin (no matter how ridiculous and meritless their claims.

1. GDAX = trading platform fun by Coinbase.  You can send Bitcoin FROM GDAX with 0 fees.
2. Read up on cold storage incluidng all 3 of the following: paper wallets, hardware wallets, and electrum offline wallets storage.  Choose one (or diversify).
3. 3 days is because network is under incredible strain right now due to unanticipated demand and a coordinated attack by Bitcoin's enemies. various solutions have been proposed and attempted by various other coins. all of them have significant flaws, vulnerabilities or drawbacks. many people, including myself, believe that due to the nature of network (and its inherent nature as a target of attacks), we should not release any changes to the network without thorough testing and making sure it will not cause the network to be paused or stopped by malicious agents. in all likelihood the mempool will clear in the next 10 days (as it always does) and then when it does,  move any funds you need to move after setting up your cold storage: 
As you can see from teh graph, actors can spam the network in the short term, but it is expensive so eventually miners take all their juicy coins (in the form of fees), and the attackers turn off their reddit shills. THey stop posting on all teh various forums and they wait.  Then once Bitcoiners have attracted a lot of newbies to the space, they attack again in full force.  To the newbie it appears genuine, organic.  Hes just bought something he doens't understand and now the bridge is collapsing. The poor soul sells at a loss. He never learned to HODL.

"I also caution market participants against promoting or touting the offer and sale of coins without first determining whether the securities laws apply to those actions.  Selling securities generally requires a license, and experience shows that excessive touting in thinly traded and volatile markets can be an indicator of “scalping,” “pump and dump” and other manipulations and frauds"
Just like they went after btc.tc and the early equity-like stuff, i would be wary of any coins where the devs are promoting it like a security to US investors.  That would be a big no-no.

I post this GIF a lot because there is a lot of truth to it:
Most people hodling Bitocin are hodlers. Most people in alt-coins are trying to get-rich-quick.  At some point they need to exit back to Bitcoin. Anything can trigger the panicking herd.  Also alts are highly correlated to Bitcoin, so if you want an alt to do well. You need that alt to win **and** for Bitcoin to do well.  
I own a small % of other coins, but 99% of alts in Bitcoin's history have gone to $0. I am sure that is the fate of 90% of the alts in existence right now.  Bitcoin is a medium of exchange. It makes sense its value would increase as the value of the network increases.
 I seriously do not understand the economics behind the valuation of many of the tokens (and I have spent a lot of time pondering it).  Even if they are successful, the tokens will still be worthless. (very small percentage make some economic sense, but even then, will likely not get enough adoption).

Since this is I will say that Bitcoin right now is probably at the start of a big hype cycle. So if you want to get in, I would start DCA'ing immediately. There are a lot of indicators: people cannot get verified on Coinbase, huge number of new signups to exchanges, search traffic, internet traffic to Bitcoin websites, etc.

Before many exchanges went down, there was generally signs. For example, MTGOX was trading at a premium that only increased until its final collapse in like the last 20+ days when it was still seemingly operational (and people like Ver were reading statements that it was solvent). 
Now, like 80% it will all end up fine with Bittrex, but just the number one rule out here, like many combat sports such as boxing, is, "Defend yourself at all times."   Not your keys, not your coin!

I am happy they launched early. Just pre-announce the trading start time! Almost all the other exchanges in the cryptospace do this. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:55:01
well people don't admit this, but basically every UTXO coin will face the exact same problem that Bitcoin faces right now.
Also every UTXO crypto (and they are the oldest, so this is also true of the other cryptos), is very much in Alpha right now.  Shit breaks, Vitalik rolls back his chain, etc. 
So some people want to go real fast and not worry like silly things like centralization.  other people know there are a huge number of actors waiting for Bitcoin to reveal a momentary weakness.  When that weakness is revealed, they will try to slay Bitcoin, thus terribly setting back the crypto movement for at least our lifetime 
(watch if / as BTC makes massive falls, all other cryptos will also fall).  Shitcoiners think that by attackign Bitcoin, people will flow to their coins.  That is not true, people will exit the system completely in the short term.  it is too new for them.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:12:24

OK, honestly based on this response I feel like I am now just being trolled. You have trolled me similarly before (you then deleted your posts though. I remember because I was typing out a response and couldn't post because you had deleted your comment.)  I will respond respectfully one last time but after that just memes:
See the shorter time periods.  Gold experienced very extreme periods of volatility over very short time periods.  I think most would still view gold as a store of value (financial nomenclature can be subjective in certain corner cases).  
It is also interesting to see gold's experience after the USD went off the gold standard. Very interesting lessons to be learned for Bitcoin.

you are completely changing the topic of discussion and nothing to do with the rest of the thread.

Yes, exactly.  Bitcoin needs to survive and thrive for at least another 10 years. After that it can have a graceful fall to  or lower over time. But right now, Bitcoin=cryptomovement in the context of many discussions.  If it fails abruptly soon, the experiment will be set back by quite a bit, potentially to never recover.

Regulation is not the only way to achieve consensus and decide winners. VOTE WITH YOUR FEET!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:47:18
try non-reddit forums if you want good crypto discussion.
1 example:
 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:00:26
1. regulated exchanges != banks.  I don't think many Bitcoin users would argue that we dont' want regulated exchanges.  There are plenty of honest businesses in this world operating in a great manner that provides serious benefits to society.  Banking has been that way for many societies for extended periods of time.  That is not how banking is operating in our current society. 
2. You are conflating distinct groups of Bitcoin users.  There are all sorts of people attracted to Bitcoin.  They have many different viewpoints on all sorts of issues.  But people attracted to Coinbase clearly like regulated exchanges.  So the part of the Bitcoin population we are talking about clearly desires this sevice.
3. You have to be a total fool if you think BItcoin can bring down governments. It is nothing new under the sun.  Its impact on govts will be about the same as gold.  It will disrupt banks MASSIVELY though.  The idea behind Bitcoin can have longterm impacts on society, etc. But govts are always changing and responding to new technology.

FUD = fear uncertainty and doubt
So for example, recently a bunch of people that knew nothing about Futures were spreading around a lot of nonsense to scare people. They use a large number of accounts to make it seem like a large group of people all believe this.  I hesitate to mention their other key topics for various reasons, but they all rely on the same tactic:  they target the new Bitcoiner that does not yet understand it technically enough to separate the fact from the fiction.
So for example, they might send a really large number of transactions just over the dust limit with a small transaction fee to make it seem like a lot of users can't use Bitcoin (especially if they intend to mine their own transactoins).  Then they start making A LOT of posts about it with again, a large number of accounts.  They will use old accounts to try to convince people that "old Bitcoiners" are giving up.
That is why the best tool we have is to encourage everyone to understand Bitcoin fully and as completely as possible.  The better you understand Bitcoin, the better you can identify fact from fiction, and the better you can make your own decisions.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:05:38
tl;dr:  Guy didn't understand Bitcoin and still doesn't.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:27:52
So much opinoin presented as fact. 
Instead of attacking the original community that pioneered the entire space, why not think about why Bitcoin is successful? We spend a lot of energies talking to nocoiners, spreading the benefits of decentralization.  We spend a lot if time writing code that others just copy and paste to enrich themselves.
We don't ask for much, all I ask is you not come to dance on our supposed grave when your coin is doing well.  I am glad for you. I own many other coins too. But please don't be disrespectful of those that worked hard to get Bitcoin to where it is today. Focus instead of building your own project and your own community. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:16:36
not necessarily fake news.  but its a coordinated campaign to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt about Bitcoin by using many different traditional and non-traditional media and social media channels.  some is the exaggeration of real issues, some is outright lies, and some are legitimate criticisms.

It is evolved since then though into a bit of an ethos. Stated simply: By hodling you are actually likely to earn a greater return than trying to "time" an unregulated market.
A bit longer: Bitcoin is inherently valuable. We are in the price discovery stage. It is a bootstrapping process. There are many speculators. You can try to daytrade, but likely you are going to get eaten by exchange fees and whales making coordinate moves in an unregulated market. If you understand it is inherently valuable and will eventually reach its true value (for many this is much higher than todays price), then you should simply hold onto your coins and not trade. In that way, you are likely not to miss out on coordinate by buys by whales, etc.

Let them sell if they want to.  Bitcoin is all about voluntary associations.  If they want to store their purchasing power for 3 months and then use it, let them.  Nothing wrong with that.

CB trades **THREE** products.  When they introduced a fourth, they should have a previously announced **start** to the trading. That is fair to all traders.  So they can decide to bear there at the market open (**extraordinarily important for traders**). 
Again, I have 0 issues with trading it. I have 0 issues with it trading on dec 20. I have an issue with not notifying all users!!! And letting insiders and other people "in the know" be there first. The first mover advantage is very important!

well a key thing is that SegWit prevents ASIC Boost.  so if a group of miners in China, who do have a patent on ASIC Boost technology, wanted to use ASIC Boost, they would have had to split BEFORE Segwit was introduced.
Coincidentally, they forked the chain for Bcash right before SegWit was introduced.  Conveniently it would still be possible to use ASIC Boost covertly on Bcash.  Not that they would ever do that of course

The other issue is that all the old school Bitcoiners I know still live like paupers! How can normal people tell them apart for their default sycophantic, etc. type behaviors?
All prior rich professions (attorneys, doctors, bankers, politicians, etc.) have set a very well established preference:  you have to act like a total Dbag and jerkoff to everyone serving you, especially if they clearly are down on their luck and having a shitty day. In that case you actually gotta turn up the Ahole and sometimes demean them publicly.  This is they way of things and Bitcoiners seem to be fking it up for the rest of society with this atypical behavior!
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:11:11
Yes, I agree.  But I am saying if you are an entity and you want to go long, you can simply buy Bitcoin, you do not have to participate in the Futures market.
Shorting on the other hand, you either have to go through CME / CBOE and post a huge collateral.  Or you have to do it on something like BitFinex and have massive counterparty risk.

In order to sell a bitcoin, one must first **buy** a bitcoin. 
 It is absolutely impossible for a person that does not **own** a Bitcoin to become a net seller of Bitcoin.  It is impossible.  OK, if you want to say that futures sentiment can influence the spot price, fine.  
But simply adding cash settled futures doesn't affect the price directly.
Can people buy a ton of bitcoin, enter into a short position, and then sell a ton? Yes, of course.  Eventually they must exit their short position.  They are not net sellers.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:36:47
i don't disagree with that.  that is not my point. net neutrality could be the first step. the key thing is the neutrality of the net has been eroded (we will see what happens in the judicial system), and it may continue to be.  so let's get the infrastructure we need in place now, while it is still easy to do so.  rather than wait until we are right in front of the bulldozer.

Again, you are talking about a very specific time period, very specific set of parameters.  Not every variable is measured.  There are huge data constraints. People tend to generate and collect data that supports their viewpoints (see energy companies and climate change, see the food industry and sugar research).  Entire academic communities have been built to support greedy endeavors.  Given the natural bent of people interested in Economics, the area is especially prone to these types of thinking.
There were plenty of intellectuals that wrote amazing treatise in defense of monarchies.  The vast majority of the intellectual elite all agreed with them publicly.

We all wanted to created a useful medium of exchange for the world.  The market spoke and said the demand for preserving purchasing power around the world is **extremely** high.  As a result, the people seeking to secure their wealth have crowded out those wishing to make coffee purchases.  As a decentralized system, we can't control what people want to use the network for.
Everyone says they want a decentralized system, but we must accept that the reason we "designed" / "created" it, may not be the same as what hte market demands.  Trying to control who uses it is a vestige of legacy thinking IMHO.  We can't choose who gets to use the network and how, that is not in our power to decide.  We can bid on block space with our fees.
But in any case, the key thing we need is time.  All of these trolls, idiots, and FUDsters have done great damage to the community and to our devleopment rate.  It is unfortunate but it is a truth.  We need to keep ignoring htem and focus on building the infrastructure and software.  it is crazy we are in year ~9, but still many of Bitcoin's basic functions are not possible with wallets.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:09:08
there are big centralization risks to increasing the block size.  there are very poweful actors that are using a fifth column attack to divide our community.

100% I am just speak generally about FUD attacks, not just this post. Definitely not saying that fees should not be discussed. 
Discussions with people trying to truly discover the issues, consider solutions collectively, and come up with pragmatic courses of actions, those are always valuable IMHO.  If one person is really seeking spread misinformation and not have a genuine discussion, then is it is a waste of everyone's time. 
Also we did pretty much endlessly discuss this issue for years.  Many people now have entrenched viewpoints and they are not changing.  For this reason people prefer discussing other Bitcoin topics, so they downvote the same fee discussion we have had for years, to upvote the the new content.  Again, its a decentralized system.  If you don't like it, you are free to leave.  Your association is entirely voluntary.

Please see Bitcoin's difficulty:  
In short, the difficulty of the "difficult math problem" required to mine Bitcoin varies, so that Bitcoin blocks always occur roughly every 10 minutes.  Difficulty adjusts approximately every 2 weeks, so there can be short term fluctuations (sometimes dramatic).  But as long as at least 1 miner is mining, eventually the difficulty will adjust.

thats all fine. but there is a simple fact: you cannot sell Bitcoin without first owning Bitcoin.

So if you believe in Bitcoin:  buy and hodl.

I actually do agree with a short term block size increase.  I would agree with going to 2 MB right now (now that we have good empirical evidence from tests, other networks etc.). But it has to be done with the consensus of he community, not just a small group of people **know** it is the right thing. Bitcoin is a social movement and the social consensus is important. 


100% of the transactions are valid are or they would not be on the blockchain. I am not opining on valid vs. invalid uses of the network, I am just saying many were sent with the intention of never being spent (manually typingin fees and allowing dust change, using blockchain for differnet purpose, etc.).  Most readers here don't know that when you say "55% of addresses..."  You know that, thats why you write it that way.

Coinbase is fine for the novice user TBH.  if you don't like their tactics, stances, public statements, etc. then  you can choose another. Not a big deal to give them a small amount in fees to make a buy though.

Hahaha, I have been getting a bunch of these emails replied back to me from friends &amp; family from 2011 - 2013. It is really started to feed my ego too much... 
I just remind myself:  All you did was buy something. It was pretty fking obvious if you were paying attention...  Most people that got emails like this were intelligent enough to see the eventual long-term of Bitocin (i.e., where are going, not the path), but they were just too lazy to understand a subject as complex as Bitcoin.

Well to be fair, they probably do not qualify as hodlers then. And i did say hodlers :p
The cryptotraders and alt-coin pumpers will always be floating between coins until the whales eat them on some super unexpected dip and they get margin-called (or unexpected moon or whatever). But at the end of the day, those whales always end up back in Bitcoin and the traders / bagholders end up with nothing.  After you have seen 7+ years of it, it starts to become almost ridiculously transparent. 
In any case, the FUD doesn't affect the hodlers.  Various types come and go in the crypto world.  **Hodlers** remain.

Bitcoin is an idea. Bitcoin is an open source project. Bitcoin is a protocol. Bitcoin is a network.  Bitcoin is a technological experiment.  Bitcoin is an economic experiment.  Bitcoin is a social movement.
Bitcoin is many different things depending on your lens. Just because you have a narrow view of the world doesn't mean you can force the rest of us to succumb it.


LOL, the key thing we learned in 2017 was that miners actually have less power than we thought (which is now why they are resorting to these sorts of attacks).


No, many times when I first used Bitcoin, the wallets wouldn't auto-calc the max size.  So we had to type it in manually.  Very frequently I wouldn't type all of them.  I know many others that were the same.  Also many people are known to have sent encoded messages on the blockchain.  Again, that is a known fact.  Not speculation.

Fair enough.  Uanticipated Government regulation in the US could hav ea pretty big impact on the price.  Or the signalling of it.


Again, I think the same.  But that does't mean it is bad to diversify.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:46:46
depends on a lot of factors. Bitcoin network is under heavy attack right now by some very well funded folks. Depends on how much ammo the attackers are willing to spend on fees, etc. They have a big incentive to damage / hurt Bitcoin.  This is their last shot at taking down Bitcoin before the CB release of BCH so it could take a serious amount of time to return to "normal."
I am sorry if someone mislead you about Bitcoin's technology or the capabilities of its software. We are in alpha and there will be issues. But as long as you control your private keys, only you can create transactions for your controlled addresses.  The current dev team greatly prioritizes safety and security of the network over short term scalability issues (party due to the fact that it may be short term in nature. also very few people have implemented Segregated Witness, a technology that greatly reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored directly on the Blockchain).
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:36:24
Why though? Why would all of the holders be panicked about the same,specific price.  A bunch of Asians are getting in now and the price level to them is "reasonable" and it is their "anchor."

don't foget if you are a US citizen, selling a cryptocurrency is a taxable event. if you held less than 1 year it is short term capital gains (taxed at higher rate). grater than 1 year: long term capital gains right (lower rate)

Dude, stop fking panicking and man up.  Don't be act like a scared child over $1k.  If this only happened today then you need to give it some time, I am pretty sure CB will do teh right thing.  If not, then just sue them.  IF they truly took 2k and you have the evidence and only gave you 1k of Bitcoin, it should be very easy to prove.  You would have potentailly a class action if this were true too.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:53:09
it is a terrible payment processing system right now. especially with the huge influx of new users in 2017. it is just the first layer. just like the internet, the protocol will evolve over time and layers will be added.  you should definitely not be buying Bitcoin now for its use **today** as a payment processor (or even the next 2 years). beyond retarded 
LN may or may not fix it.  that doesn't really matter in the long run. I have used and test LN though. many core guys have already expressed willingness for BS increase. Luke-jr and a couple others are growing smaller in number.  It will be BS increase + things like RSK + LN + other changes over time.  this is a marathon, not a sprint.

No, the present is idiocracy and has been for some time.  Bankers are absolutely shearing the common person and operating with total impunity.  Blockchain and Bitcoin will inject some much needed transparency into our financial system, as it has become entirely too corrupt.


Definitely appreciate this viewpoint.  But Buffet never has invested in commodities like Gold historically, but that doesn't mean that other people haven't done fantastically well preserving their wealth in gold.  They are not mutualy exclusive.
Look though, you are right though that bitcoin is an experiment.  It is not guaranteed to succeed. Like all mediums of exchanges it requires faith by the userbase (this is true of all currencies too btw).  Going from 0 --&gt; $1 was very hard, but now the value has been established and it is much tougher to convince people the system isn't useful for commerce.  It would appear at this point going from here ot $0 would be very difficult, because at lesat some of us would still want to us eit as a medium of exchange.
I do respect your views and your civility here though, thanks for engaging in the discussions!

2 things:
1. Just because someone says something about Bitcoin doesn't mean its true or a fact.
2. Colloquially it could be referred to as a currency.  But in the context of an economic technical discussion, it is 100% not a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:22:08
The question is, in the longterm, assuming Bitcoin can integrate other scaling solutions.  Is there a need for multiple POW coins?  I think we can have near infinite POS, but maybe only 1 POW coin is needed.  In that case, I think Bitcoin is well positioned to win.  (I am referring to primarily many of the two-way peg systems that will want to use Bitcoin as the ultimate "no backsies" ledger). 
Right now in all coins, there is a lot of future expectations baked into their price. So it is imporntat to consider the longterm.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:45:41


No, if we are discussing financial theory.  A net long position can be entered into for an indefinite period of time.  This is not a trivial point for determining long-term equilibrium.  Especially if the asset is something like land.


What? Spot = current market price of underlying.  Your sentence makes no sense. 


Yes, that is fine, but how does it explain that futures can "hit the price" of Bitcoin.  THem entering hte market is fine.  Won't affect teh underlyign in any dramatic way, (Unless there is a concerted short and sell, which is not impossible but improbable).

Back then there were a huge number of individuals that could easily crash the price as the volume was tiny, the exchanges were weak, insecure, and eaisly DDOS'd.  It as a very, very different game back then.  The main value back then was the potential for the price to reach the current levels, so you kind of knew you might get thrown around if you invest your whole stack right away.  So you just kind DCA'd your way in. Also no gov't had really even acknowledged bitcoin much, much less regulated it.  Very, very different group of hodlers and mindset.  Mucher higher % of libertarian types.

don't worry, almost everyone panic sells during the first major media and social media negative blitz. (and their second, and frequently the third). 
looking at the price history, it seems easy to say you will be able to stomach the dips.  living through the onslaught of FUD, people spamming the network, etc. is something else entirely. it definitely does get easier each time as you can more easily separate FUD from fact. 
Also what does that emoji mean?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:43:08

@_date: 2017-12-05 01:51:06
Don't worry, I certainly understand how to construct a short or long Bitcoin position.
My point is that an influx of short sellers will **not** cause the price to go down just due to the fact that they are participating in the market.  Eventually the shorter has to exit the position.

Bitcoin is an experiment.  Bitcoin is a protocol, it is network, it is a social movement.  It is all of these things.  No one controls it (even though many would like to).  Some do have significant influence over it, but never have we such a large decentralized system with no controller. It is as liberating as it can also be intellectually terrifying to a certain type of person (nothing wrong with that).
If you think about Central Banks, the way govt are acting, etc.  You can think about how the world might likely value a Bitcoin token very highly (to be used as a medium of exchange).  The Bitcoin network itself isn't really directly affected by the price (only insofar as it affects volume).

The key thing you are missing that futures have been around for a very long time.  People have thought about and tried these exact things before.  People entering into the futures with you are very aware of this as well. A bigger fish could easily see you telegraphing your moves and wreck you by just being ready to scoop up all your coins on feb 14 (in case you try it).   
He might also try to cause a spike earlier, either forcing a margin call on you, or he might just frontrun you. 
Basically he has a lot of tools to play back.  In futures markets, there is always somoen eiwth hte exact opposite incentives as you.

Most of those guys are just 14 year olds with $20 in bitcoin and but still $300 is a lot to them.  they are drinking mountain dews and getting fired up and going on the internet.  nothing wrong with that, let them have their fun.  they have more time to post.
Also I agree we are an ardent community.  But honestly what **really** fires me up is thinking about people that i know / know of that have been trully scammed in this space (and there are no shortage of these stories).
For this reason we sometimes may bang the Bitcoin drum very hard, because it is the most decentralized, secure network.  That is a fact.  You can't go to wrong with Bitcoin if you believe in cryptos.  
Once you step out of Bitcoinland, its **~1,000,000x more the wild west**.  And it is easy to get cut down out there. (And it actually applies many traditional asset markets too)

I disagree.  At this point the majority of hodlers are probably in the following countries:
1. Japan
2. S Korea
3. USA
4. European Nordic nations collectively
I don't think bans outside of these key markets are going to affect it much (and actually might improve the value as the Govts are essentially acknowledging that central banks can't co-exist with honest money). Bans in these countries are very unlikely for numerous reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:45:11
But potentially centralized miners in China (not nearly as bad as it used to be), is FAR WORSE on a chain that allows ASIC-Boost, if those same miners have the technology (for which they have a  patent).
So that is indeed a key difference between bcash and Bitcoin. 
(The level of adoption of SegWit is completely irrelevant to this point, just that it is implemented is a binary outcome for ASIC-Boost)

This is absurdly reductionist.  It will probably take about 30 - 300 years and predicting the price at that point is an exercise in futility.  Sure, maybe 1 million is right. But maybe at that point USD could just be one random currency and no longer the global reserve currency.  It might be hyperinflated into oblivion. Every major empire has collapsed so far.  The global political landscape has been known to shift dramatically historically, and it is foolish to assume it couldn't happen again.  
The benefits from widespread Blocckhain use will be far greater than the benefits that Bitcoin provides though (mainly efficiencies in wealth preservation, commerce, accounting, , trading, financial markets, bureaucracy  etc.) will be massive.  The benefits, extraordinary.  So many laborers can leave the factory and pursue careers that allow them to self-actualize, so many soldiers can go home, so many worthless bureaucratic positions can eliminated, and so much corruption brought to the light.  These are not pipe dreams.  They are imminently feasible. Probably the entrenched institutions will stop it in our lifetimes.  But that doesn't mean we can't imagine where we **could** go and work towards it.


So many poor assumptions again here.  A 100x increase would take a good bit of time.  We need to go through bubbles caused by the speculators.  They are inevitable but not a big deal.  These price fluctuations make the mining game much harder than you may think.  Even if we saw a rapid 100x price increase, you can't really predict how the mining will react. Just check a historical price chart to mining hash rate to see this.  
Anyway all of this ignores some a crucial POW can always be changed with consensus, and ultimately probably will have to be changed due to advances in cryptography.  Nothing wrong with that.

No one can control how people use their private keys.  If they want to send their Bitcoins to an address and leave them there, no one can say otherwise or force them to move their Bitcoins.
It is your opinion that buying and holding is not **using** Bitcoin.  It is not a fact.
Many people thought Bitcoin would make a great currency right away.  We grew **way** too fast and unexpectedly.  The infrastructure and software needs time to develop.  Eventually we will be able to handle way more transactions.  We are not yet there. Users, companies, and other entities have not even yet implemented the most recent scaling solution (segwit).  
Why? Many people are fine with the current Bitcoin fees.  What is my evidence?  The blockchain and mempool.
As a result, right now Bitcoin is an amazing store of value and a good medium of exchange.  Eventually it will be an amazing store of value and an amazing medium of exchange.

I hold bitcoin.  I hold other coins.  I am not going to tell anyone what to do with their hard earned wealth.  Spend, invest, and gamble as you see fit.  But be aware of the tactics of those who only seek to profit from your misfortune.  Be aware of their motives.  
(Also eventually you will be able to profit of their moves if you understand and can predict their moves...)

If that is your reaction to this image.  Then fk yes I want you to stay away from Bitcoin!  This is a very accurate description of Bitcoin! It is not even political, just a description of the protocol!


Yup, I'm the elitist...

Hahaha indeed. Also just remember that you don't have to trade this. You can just buy and hodl. Its a much safer strategy if you believe in Bitcoin's long term (out all many of my friends that joined at some point before 2014, the ones that did hte best are the ones that simply bought and held (instead of trading or "investing" in btc companies, etc.)). 
It is an unregulated market.  There are many players with very deep pockets. They have ties to media organizations.  They are good at steering people and planting ideas in your mind.  I don't mean to get all tinfoil hat, but its just something you need to be aware of as you read MSM articles, etc. 
They will orchestrate the creation of panic selling conditions again in the future.

haha ok. i have diversified the whole way up and into US equities (i do confess to a small amount of event-driven trading though), so i won't be reducing my Crypto position anymore.  i actually added some today, and i will add some more if it continues to drop.  
But this has been my primary strategy and it has served me well.  i respect that you may have a different viewpoint. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:05:44


That is just an extremely FUDy title since it is based entirely on misinformation.  IRS is not some all-knowing being that can demand whatever they want from companies.  They are regulated body that generally has to use targeted requests when asking businesses for large amounts of data.  They are not **the authority**, the taxpayer can actually take them to court and win. They are just doing their best to interpret and enforce tax laws that they did not write (responsibility of legislative branch).
In any case, you should be careful what you post.  Because you could cause people to make bad decisions based on your posts.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:41:11
you can have trustworthy actors without regulation.  there are other systems and ways of dong things. it will take some time to get there as bad actors reveal themselves and self-select themselves for death. 
Over time people will flow to the trustworthy exchanges. Its a long process, but probably in the end will lead to a better system.
There will definitely be some growing pains. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:36:19
No one knows the future.  But if you look at the order book right, now, there are a huge amount of sells a the lowest ask, and the buy side is incredibly thin.  GDAX appears to not want to allow trading as it seems very likely it will drop like a rock when they do. 
Who knows tho, someone with a ton of ammo might be waiting to fire off a lot of market buys when it starts, nobody knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:53:55
if you exchange your cryptos for USD, it is a taxable event. even if you buy cryptos again right away. you may think its unfair and that it doens't make any sense: you would not be the first to say that about the US tax code

LOL.  Poor girl, i think she probably had like 5 hours of reserach into Bitcoin before she had to make the Bear case. Honestly these are hacks (and the crappy suit is just an indicator and result, not the reason).  Here are the big boys in finance talking about Bitcoin and cryptos:
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:32:29
100%! Hodling is about how to tactically manage your Bitcoin investment (kind of like preferring index fund investing over active trading which generates a lot of fees).  It is **definitely not** about blindly pouring all of your wealth into Bitcoin. That is incredibly foolish.  In almost no scenario should 1 asset make up your entire portfolio.  It is about not getting wasted by the whales and the high trading fees on the exchanges.
Also if you have a major life purchase, you should definitely be selling your Bitcoins if you are a hodler. Why? If you had proper asset allocation before, you need to sell a portion of all your assets to remained balanced.  (Unless that asset had been specifically purchased to be used as purchasing power for that product).
Also very well said in your OP!
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:03:50


Futures markets have nothing to do with centralized bankers for what its worth.  But in any case, Bitcoin is all about voluntary associations.  Just like we can't prevent people from using Bitcoins for whatever purpose (although they leave a very detailed trail), we can't prevent them from creating a futures market. They are free to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:53:58

Electrum is a great wallet and has easy to use cold storage.  It also has very good documentation for the user, where everything is explained very clearly. I believe it only supports Bitcoin (as with many of the most trusted wallets unfortunately). if you post on the Ethereum subreddit, they should be able to offer several good wallets.  
The absolute safest wallet is downloading the Blockchain and running the core client.  You set the rules exactly, and you know exactly what rules you choose to run. Bitcoin was originally designed for everyone to run their own node.  It is good to do so, not for the network, but for your own safety and protection. 
bitcoin.org has very high standards for its wallets and I would say all of them are pretty trustworthy:

both are very much cash settled.  CBOE relies on the price at one exchange at a specific, predetermined time.  CME relies on the average of multiple exchanges over a period of time.  both will probably be fine TBH, but CME's is inherently much more difficult / expensive to game.

Sounds like you have no clue what you are talking about and just taking shots in the dark?


You can look at the exact thresholds if you care to research.  Coinbase has already said it will notify the costumers for which they had to make reports to the IRS IIRC.

Buying for long term:  yes, highly likely to be much higher eventually.
Short term:  Nobody knows.  Any whale / coordinated group of whales can have a huge impact.  No one knows what they will do, and they won't tell you.  THe general short term trend seems to be bullish though as new Thanksgiving buyers enter the market / Asians enter.

Life is a gamble.  Whether you view it that way or not.  Being 100% in USD &amp; equities and 0% in Bitcoin can be viewed as risky just as being 100% in Bitcoin and 0% in USD and equities.  It is all a matter of perspective.

For sure. Admittedly i am not an expert on net neutrality.  But i did find it alarming that Ajit Pai specifically mentioned Bitcoin mining, almost as if laying the groundwork that later it could be excluded specifically (he doens't say it explicitly for sure):
"By contrast, online traffic is exploding, and we consume exponentially more data over time. With the dawn of the Internet of Things, with the development of high bit-rate applications like virtual reality, with new activities like high-volume bitcoin mining that we can’t yet fully grasp, we are imposing ever more demands on the network."
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:13:19
I am 80% bitcoin.  I think its good to have a little exposure, but I do think 98% will go to 0 eventually. I also do think another coin may unseat Bitcoin in the very long term, but I do not think it has been created yet.  None of the techs seem to be "different enough" or they have too great of other negatives that make them too high risk.
Pro's of alt-coins
1. faster ability to implement changes due to generally centralized dev team
2. generally some type of "new tech"
Cons of alt-coins:
1. primary: unless you know the dev team personally, they may just bail on the project and sell all their premined coins. you will never have a warning of this. (same risk technically does exist in Bitcoin but none of them have Satoshi's hodl history)
2. generally much higher centralization in many areas of the ecosystem (dev team, exchanges, holders of premined coins)
3. higher risk of SEC activity focused on stopping progress
4. no "Bitcoin" brandname to help spur mainstream adoption
5. you need to consider carefully the premine and POW hash functions. Think about how the longterm may play out. Is a 51% attack possible? Feasible? is there motiviation for one? (i.e., would an attacker want to attack the network / hold hostage like a DDOS attack?)
Many more pros and cons of both, just some key ones. if you calculate an invesmtent in all of hte alt-coins it will be terrible. A super high percentage have, are, and will go to 0.00 units by any measurement.
Also people forget that cryptos are just as much economic experiments as they are technology. Bitcoin has a large economic / social movemnet behind it (some others have really good ones too).

They have succeeded in attacking and damaging the BItcoin community (and earning more coins for themselves).  Their backers are thrilled. Expect continued attacks. Also expect there may be seemingly random and unexpected uplifts as they finish out their pump n dupmp's, etc. (they are just trying to earn more real BTC at the end of the day).
Expected continued attacks.  4 years ago I could tell you the constitution of the average hodler.  Now it depends on a bunch of guys that cannot speak my language (**WHICH IS FKING AWESOME AND IT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS THING**). 
But regardless of the native language of the average Bitcoin hodler, I know the Bitcoin protocol has remain unchanged. I can see it is is functioning exactly as programmed. People want to use it so much, they are bidding huge amounts for blockspace. I can't stop them from doing that. Nor do I intend to try.  It keeps our honest miners well fed, which is great!
Stay tuned.

lol, he is a banker.  he relies on the current financial system to earn his living.  if people could transact without a middleman, his business would be extremely impacted. the 3 largest US banks charged $6.4 BILLION just in overdraft and ATM fees last year... This is just the very tip of the iceberg.  BItcoin would not only affect commercial banking, but also investment banking (such as the gentleman providing his opinion).  
Therefore he would prefer if the asteroid would **not** occur, but it is inevitable.  Bitcoin is freedom and banks can't stop it.  You cannout outlaw an asteroid, you cannot stop it.

Well that is why initiatives like BItcoin satellites are very important, even though Bitcoin detractors like to mock them.
That way even without the internet you could utilize your Bitcoins.  Also, we need to work on finding ways to transmit the Blockchain via radiofrequency, bouncing off of the atmosphere, etc. 
Hopefully net neutrality is a wake-up call on why these initiatives are important and worth pursuing.

Why? Everyone has equal foreknowledge and everyone can make themselves available for the market open if they so desire.

For sure, it is obviously ideal to have an internet connection. No doubt.  But the whole point is, a person could theoretically just use a public space for it, etc.

I am a big blocker, I have been for years. I want larger block sizes, but it must be done through a transparent process that establishes social consensus.  Not by launching a fork and maliciously attacking Bitcoin to bring it to its knees. 
Ver has some very radical ideas (from the viewpoint of the average person).  He also has a very shady history (promoting MTGOX right before its collapse, sending explosives through the mail, etc.).  I don't judge him for any of those things.  He is just a young guy trying to change this broken world.  
However, CNBC knows exactly how it will look to the average retail investor, when they bring him on CNBC, ask him things like "whats your take on insider trading?"  The retail investor listens to that, then googles the "CEO of Bitcoin.com."  How do you think they will react?

Bitcoin is an open source project that started in 2009 (a lot of work an the ideas had been done prior though).  We have had some major bugs, issues, etc. that got solved along the way.  Another advantage for Bitcoin:  the most battle tested network of them all.  Other cryptos like Ethereum, for example, had a rollback of their chain initiated by the centralized dev team because they like to go fast.
But in any case, new technology will have to be added to the Bitcoin over the next 5 - 10 years, to improve the project.  Anyone can contribute to this project! 
As you can see it is a very active github with many people involved. 
But in any case, you can support Bitcoin and be involved without buying any Bitcoin at all!

Correct.  Anyone can generate a receiving address and receive a payment with no internet access. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:01:02
The original statement:


You were using transactions as an input to evaluate Bitcoin's market cap. My hypothesis was that there is no comparison, so we can't determine if that is a true statement.
Valuation specialists utilize different valuation methodologies for different asset classes due to their differing characteristics.  For example, to value a bond, the discounted cash flow is the obvious and clear choice.  To value an early stage tech company that will likely be bought out, likely a market-based approach based on the expected exit multiple will be used.  
Cryptocurrencies are an entirely new asset class. There is no commonly accepted valuation methodology for it.  I agree transactions are probably the most important input though.

electrum is very well documented, just read the documentation. its all explained
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:58:46
All of the cryptos have a major issue. They cannot scale 10x - 100x from the current size (which is needed).  We need to develop new technologies for this.
The current valuation of the cyrptos is **not** based on current utility. It is based on technology that could be developed, and it is based on the future (just like stocks).  Now, Bitcoin devs are the main ones trying to actually find longterm solutions.  Because some of the short term solutions have very great risks.  
Bitcoin is also the largest and most secure newtork.  A 51% attack is feasible on most other cryptos.  Many people want bigger block sizes, becuase bigger block sizes = more centralization = network easy to take down for periods. Right now there are about ~12,000 reachable nodesw (27% in USA, 17% in Germany, 7% in France, 6% in China).
No network is even close to this size.  Many people hate crypto and want to see us fail.  They do so by first weakening the network and then attacking it. This is the first steps of their plan. 
Many other coins also have impressive networks and there are many cool projects. Have fun, but be very aware of the intentions &amp; motivations of those that you listen to as you decide which coins are worth purchasing. Be especially aware of the probable distribution of the coins amongst the users (in many cases the dev team will hold a very sig % of the total float).

Wow... Much respect for the CFTC.  Bitcoin being classified as a commodity is actually a vastly underrated benefit IMHO.  Commodity traders are not bankers.  Their history is tied to the creation of markets primarily for the **producers** (i.e., hardworking men and women doing real, production-based work as opposed to sitting in ivory towers and calculating the gains from cutting 10% of the workforce and coming up with optimal capital structures (like what i did for decades)). They have a very different history than Wall Street.  Now, have the two slowly merged over time and now institutional investors are heavy players in the traditional commodities markets? Yes of course, I don't want to be deceptive about that. 
But the commodity guys' have been protecting the little guy (like farmers by providing transparent, trustworthy futures markets) for a very long time.

you could use it as a base and built upon it or use it for a much larger system, use it as a component in a different system, etc.

NO NO NO! Do not buy Bitcoin unless you want to use it as a medium of exchange or you really believe the Bitcoin network will be much more valuable than the current valuation of $253 billion (based on $15k price).


I certainly advocate you thinking for yourself and following your own convictions.  Stay away from Bitcoin if you do not believe in it! Also luckily for you you can easily short Bitcoin now!


At a minimum, you could use the Bitcoin network to send messages. It actually could also serve as the first layer &amp; component to an entire new system that could eventually supplant the internet.  that may seem crazy now, but it is actually not that crazy to foresee. 
but in any case, that point is moot, because gold's value doesn't come from its value as jewelry or the 1e-6 of the gold supply they use in industrial applications. that is irrelevant. it is central bankers holding gold that gives it value (there are a couple of other sig holders of gold but those are the key).
Gold, Fiat, and Bitcoin will co-exist for some time. Another person's take:

We are likely to only going to get more stable as the market cap increases.  Prepare yourself for potentially more stability!!
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:21:22
It is a very tough question.  I would advocate that all people do their own research.  Couple of pros and cons of alt-coins vs. Bitcoin.
Pro's of alt-coins
1. faster ability to implement changes due to generally centralized dev team
2. generally some type of "new tech"
Cons of alt-coins:
1. primary: unless you know the dev team personally, they may just bail on the project and sell all their premined coins.  you will never have a warning of this. (same risk technically does exist in Bitcoin but none of them have Satoshi's hodl history)
2. generally much higher centralization in many areas of the ecosystem (dev team, exchanges, holders of premined coins)
3. higher risk of SEC activity focused on stopping progress
4. no "Bitcoin" brandname to help spur mainstream adoption
5. you need to consider carefully the premine and POW hash functions.  Think about how the longterm may play out.  Is a 51% attack possible? Feasible? is there motiviation for one? (i.e., would an attacker want to attack the network / hold hostage like a DDOS attack?)
Many more pros and cons of both, just some key ones. if you calculate an invesmtent in all of hte alt-coins it will be terrible. A super high percentage have, are, and will go to 0.00 units by any measurement. 
Also people forget that cryptos are just as much economic experiments as they are technology. Bitcoin has a large economic / social movemnet behind it (some others have really good ones too).

Well said, but:


To be fair though, a lot of very experienced bitcoiners were calling "tops" pretty much continously from $5k to $10k, and now we just had a huge dip that didnt even hit $10k (at least not yet, anything is possible).  So you are still up 20% even if you bought at $10k when it seemed way overbought.

There was clearly a marked ramp-up to the attacks that coincided with Bitcoin's difficulty change.  
1. Swede guy going on every single traditional media channel to say Bitcoin sucks and it is dying as the "CTO of bitcion.com"
2. Bunch of contrived transactions (see the analysis on Twitter)
3. CNBC and Ver planning interviews to totally bash Bitcoin
There are a lot more. The BCH guys think they are trying to make Bitcoin better, I do believe they are sincere. A lot of them put a lot of time and energy into this project (especially Ver). I understand completely why they are mad, and they have every right to be.  But right now they are being used like pawns by bankers to attack the cryptomovement so the Bankers can win with centralized coins like Ripple or AmazonCoin.

I used to agree.  I still hold both. I do my best to be a good Bitcoin "ambassador" when I can.  But I now believe 2 things:
1. If Bitcoin dies in the next 5 years, crypto will be severely impacted for at least 20 - 30 years (full mainstream penetration will take much longer)
2. The forkers tactics have become unacceptable.  I think 80% of them are probably totally fine, and I actually would have preferred a short term block increase (not at the cost of losing the core developers though).  But you can't deny that a small 20% seem to be using incredibly malicious tactics to push their agenda.  I am seriously considering dumping my forks because it is seriously annoying me. (Would be a pain cuz all in paper wallets).

Umm no, I would say it implies the exact opposite. Many wealthy people will want to own a small amoutn of bitcoin (0.1% to 10% of their net worth), which would result in a market cap ridiculously higher.  It is very much like gold in many ways, but also has the potential to be used as a medium of exchange as a bonus.


No, the newbies and get-rick quick crowd will they panic as they always do (and would do with whatever BS they would have invested in), and the hodlers will buy the dip.

Bitcoin exchanges = banks. Using a bitcoin exchange to manage your private keys **is not** owning Bitcoins. 
People keep wanting to get into crypto, but they don't learn how to roll their own private keys in the physical world so they don't understand the benefit of Bitcoin (it takes about 2 hours to lean).  so they keep getting IOU's instead of Bitcoins and those places giving out the IOU's get hacked. The suckers that got IOU's instead of spending 2 hours to lean to roll their own key get burned. 
Banks, ATMS, exchanges, etc. get hacked all the time throughout the world. It gets downplayed but if you look it up, you can find it. How do they pay for it? You pay for it.  Yes, that's right, the losses are socialized and you pay for it through monthly fees, overdraft fees, decreased service, etc.

True, but CB does claim the coins are insured (I believe I read by LLoyd's at one point)?
From their website:
"All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft."

So basically your private key is just a random number chosen from an enormously huge domain.  As long as you generate that number randomly, only you can spend whatever coin you have.  You download your wallet software, generate the key, which you do not show ANYONE.  Then you use that to generate a public key and a public address.  You share the public address as your "send-to" address for your coins (whatever they may be).
Bitcoin has a very long history and there are many OPEN SOURCE wallets out with very long histories,and you can review the source code for yourself. Many other coins do not have open source wallets. When the wallet runs, you have no idea what the program just did exactly (unless you are very proficient with computers). It might have just chosen a predetermined seed so someone else could steal from you.  It might have just inserted a sleeper virus to ransomware your computer 6 months from now. You have no idea. It is not open source. You just downloaded a random software and gave it free reign on your HD, GPU and CPU.

No, the possibility of going indefinitely long Bitcoin is very important.  Many people have inadvertently gone indefinitely long bitcoin.  This has an important impact on the price.
it is also important that people that are not currently involved in the space **can become** net buyers.  They cannot become **net sellers**.  This is key.  
Regardless if people couldn't enter sizable shorts before or not.  Shorts are ultimately good for markets.  They help reduce volatility. 
Have fun man!

Buying bitcoin is not just an investment.  You are voting with your feet.  You are choosing the economic system that you want to thrive in this world.  An economic system built on transparency and minimal barriers to entry. An ecosystem where people can secure their labor / wealth with merely a computer and no internet access.
By buying bitcoin and helping it progress, you are most definitely helping us to get to the endgame, which will have a great benefit for humanity.

For sure.  I don't think it will replace fiat (gold and fiat co-existed for a very long time, its not so different).  But I do think it will continue to be a value medium of exchange for preserving and exchanging purchasing power.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:40:19
I do agree with you that the word "market cap" is a misnomer. I only use it because it has become standardized by the mainstream media.


Correct.  We, the true users of bitcoin, can't stop speculators.  They cause bubbles, but that is OK.  Normally you can profit pretty handsomely off of them after you have seen 1 or 2. So all in all, its a net positive. Once we are at a greater market cap, they will have less influence.  FOr now, they actually and importantly, provide liquidity.


I spend bitcoins to buy things directly all the time.  All of the following accept Bitcoins: 
But also do you deny the existence of exchanges where a person can easily exchange Bitcoin for USD, EUR, JPY, KRW, or a whole host of other currencies? So by converting my Bitcoin (which I have used to preserve my the purchasing power earned by my labor) I can turn into a transactional currency like Steam dollars, amazon coins, USD, whatever briefly before I buy something.  Makes it a bit easier tax wise, but both are not bad if you plan ahead.


But why do you think they would all want to spend at exactly teh same time?  Hodlers come and go as they have life expenses.  Hodling does not mean never selling.  Bitcoin is just a place to store your purchasing power (there are not many good assets right now due to US equity bubble, and bubbles in many other markets).  
If Central banks start acting responsibly and politicians stop using their positions as if they were given the keys to the vault, then Bitcoins will start to lose value IMHO.  Before that day, people will continue to use them (and with increasing adoption) as a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:24:30
I understand and appreciate your viewpoint.  I respectfully disagree.  I think your logic is reductionist and does not appreciate the complexity of the situation. In other words, 
I think you are underthinking it. ;)
Using old paradigms to evaluate new technologies is a classic flaw that has been repeated throughout history.  If you were to value it like a traditional asset though, I would definitely compare it to other commodities, especially gold.  Definitely not stocks though.  
My issue with your logic is that you are assuming that 300k transactions is low volume compared to the Market cap of 171 Billion.  That ratio can't be compared to anything else.  There are no comparables. If you compare it to gold, Bitcoin has an extraordinary high ratio of 300k to 171 B against Gold's ratio (the vast majority of Gold sits with Central banks and does not move).


Yes, I agree this is possible.  I do have a considerable amoutn of expeirence researching and investing in alternative asset claseses though. It is important to acknowledge that we all exhibit biases though.

ASIC-Boost (for which there is a registered patent in China by a Bitcoin mining company) is technically impossible with SegWit.  That is a fact. I agree that both chains do utilize the same hashing algorithm for sure.

I am not a tax attorney. I believe that is correct. But a couple of things:
1. you are now likely paying short term capital gains instead of long term capital gains (big difference)
2. Also i this appraoch if it goes to 0, then in scenario A, you still may end up paying taxes even if you don't actually make any gains on your investment by the end of it. Its pretty crazy, but it does happen.  many guys during the tech bubble didn't realize the tax implications of many of hteir actions and ended up bankrupt. 
In scneario B, you get ot enjoy long term capital gains and you never had a tax event until your final sale.

You are comparing Bitcoin's 300k transactions ON THE NETWORK to Gold's ETF volume? You trolling me?
Here I try to put simply for you:
How many people trade gold bars / coins for GOODS AND SERVICES every day? That would be the appropriate comparable to the Bitcoin transactions on the network.  Gold is not used in daily commerce, yet is a great store of value.  It is also volatile.  Bitcoin is similar in many ways.  There are some important differences.

All those sorts of methods can be easily circumvented if someone really wants attack.
I think the fee market is honestly a very eloquent, simple, and effective solution.  If you want to attack the network with a spam attack, you really have to do it by helping to fund the auditors lol.  Really kind of beutiful.
Also we learned recently the fees also helps keep from hashing power from leaving for too long.
At the end of the day too, I do think there is some truth to "no such thing as spam."  At the end of hte day, we all project onto Bitcoin what the network "should be."  But really who is anyone to say what the network is to be used for?

A confession: I am drunk and actually was just on the phone earlier today with my buddy who is an "African journalist" (yea hes a rich prick who had some sort of associated guilt, but i can't explain born rich people...).  Anyway, he happened to bring up Bitcoin because he had saw some of my posts on social media years ago (I no longer post about it).  He had seen an open auction exchange while he was investigating another story and wanted to see if it was on my radar (it was).  He said he didn't know the volume (trust me, I pressed him).

Yea, we could very well see a retracement to 8k, but we could very well continue the bull run into well over 10k before we see a large dip.  Nobody really knows.  Personally I think this rally has a good bit of room to run yet, mainly due to demand from S. Korea and Japan.
It is also becoming even more important to get in early to take advantage of all the free airdrops.

Also a large percentage are run by scammers.  You might not realize this now.  A large percentage of people interested the cryptospace get duped by these conmen and then lose their hard-earned cash.  As a result they think crypto is a scam and never come back.  So enabling these aholes actually does hurt bitcoin.
Also something very important.  Many have known founders / lead dev teams that are premining, etc.  Even if they have the best of intentions, the SEC will take many down and essentially kill the coin (by forcing devs to sell and not participating in the project in the future).
This is there are plenty of other subreddits to follow general crypto news.  You want to gamble and hope you are not a bagholder on the alts, GL.  You can get some insane returns.  I can also get insane returns by hitting a number on the roulette wheel.  I won't be doing either.

I have followed bitcoin for a long time.  I don't think its prospects have ever been brighter (there was some very real uncertainty in the 2013 - 2016 period). 
It is impossible to say what certainty what will happen, but if you believe the price is trending upwards, theoretically and technically investing it now is actually superior to cost averaging (it just is more of a white knuckle ride).  
The price of Bitcoin + BitcoinSegWit2x will probably be greater than the price of "Bitcoin" at the time of the split. By owning bitcoins now you will get tokens on both chains. It is probably a good idea to sell BitcoinSegwit2x immediately after the split.
The price of Bitcoins on the legacy chain that will have 1 MB blocks may drop right after the fork. Then again once people realize that Bitcoin has survived many prior hard forks without skipping a beat and just did the same with that one... The price could moon for a good bit.
Just FYI here is some finance literature on DCA vs. "all in."  People have researched it a long time since DCA is "conventional wisdom" but basically there is no "real" support for it.  The main value is less stress on the investor for feeling "responsible" for investing at the top.  Which **does** have real utility.

@_date: 2017-11-01 18:40:45
All of this is my personal opinion:
With the upcoming hardforks I would say the best option right now is to own your own keys.  Its uncertain what will exactly happen and if you own the keys to your bitcoins,  you don't really have to worry about it.
Best case, you can sell your S2X tokens for some extra BTC.
Worst case, you need to wait 24 - 48 hours to start using the network reliably again with most wallets and you have lost nothing.
If there were a small percentage of any meaningful hardfork "dividends," the IRA would be a much stronger option (such as any purchases after the Nov hardfork).
Also there are some scenarios where you might be in a better position if you own your own bitcoins as opposed to owning them through a custodian.  Can't enumerate all of them as some are unknown unknowns if you will.  We will know more in a few years.  But a few: obvious impending "doom" for bitcoin so you want to sell as fast as possible on an exchange while you still can; reduction of counterparty risk to 0% (your custodian could go bankrupt / commit fraud due to another area of the business and has to sell its bitcoins to pay to debtors if not appropriately ring fenced and audited); etc.  
Also owning outright is guaranteed to have most impact on increasing the price  because fractional reserves are always possible if you don't control your own private keys.

Roger Ver did a lot for bitcoin.  A lot more than 95% of users will ever do. 
He is a naive, idealistic young man that wants Bitcoin to have a real impact on the world.  That is admirable. He is also a bit naïve and being hoodwinked by some real experienced conmen.  They might even be threatening him.  
I think he thinks he is doing the right thing, but all these constant attacks by random idiots are just making the situation worse (and generally baseless attacks).  And now he is doing stuff that is just clearly scammy.  Very unfortunate situation IMHO.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:00:53
Not necessarily in the short term do we need to go full mainstream.  The huge amount of idiots that have flooded bitcoin communities over the past two years are causing some serious problems.
One benefit of a dip might be to get rid of some of these get-rich-quick idiots so we can reduce the amount of noise in the discussions. I suppose going mainstream and pumping the price even more is not a terrible result either...
I think longterm will be better if we focus on the developing the tech and supporting software over user adoption.

2 - 5 years ago this would simply be:  "Bitcoin is a bubble" "Bitcoin is dead" "Bitcoin the Ponzi scheme will run out soon".  (Basically many of the same articles you see today).  There are some minor exceptions.
3 months - 1.5 years ago:  Some technologists / influential people start to come out publicly for Bitcoin's advantages (i.e., Bill Gates, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, few bold finance folks, etc.).
0 - 3 months:  More balanced and accurate depictions of the Bitcoin network and its actual advantages over legacy money.

You are like 1% to recover them based on that response.  I just want to be real.
But where was the multi bit wallet located?  Do you still have that hard drive? Multibit is a wallet, not an exchange.    If you can find the hard drive with the wallet file, you can potentially recover your bitcoins.  Even if you deleted the files, your computer won't overwrite that portion of the drive  unless the memory is full.  A data recovery specialist can help you even if you have hit "empty recycle bin."  I don't know all the details, to know whether its worth the effort.  But if it is 5+ bitcoins, you might want to think about it.

Blockchains are triple entry ledgers that are 100% transparent and voter fraud would no longer be possible for any entities seeking to undermine true democracy (due to the nature of the system).
It would also allow people to vote from the convenience of their homes in 60 seconds without having to sacrifice an entire working day (as it is in some countries).
No one would be able to question the results as it is fully transparent (while still allowing for a secret ballot). The only reason a rational actor would not want the Blockchain to be used for voting is if they wanted to commit voter fraud.  They will not use that reason of course publicly.

Yes, of course.  There is nothing wrong with investing in a risky assets when you know the risks.  Investing in a pump and dump orchestrated by scammers is something totally different.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:02:04
Great question.  Personally I think all 3 of the above will be offered by various service providers.  Initially the people will like the other entity holding the key.  I think over time more and more people will want to hold their own keys (mainly because the hardware and software solutions are going to continue to get better).  As a result the winners will be the ones offering that service.  That will probably take 5 - 20 years.  People are slow to change practices / beliefs regarding money.  This is good, conventional wisdom.
According to traditional financial theory, the  benefits of derivatives are helping improve price discover and risk management.  Price discovery:  futures market helps provide a lot of information relating to expectations regarding price of the underlying.  
Risk mangement:  Adding derivatives allow the trader / farmer more options to construct portfolios to hedge more easily and to directly best hedge against to the risk to which  they are exposed to.  In practice, trading derivatives can also have less transaction costs (good from a very active traders' standpoint).

@_date: 2017-11-08 21:48:24
haha, yea, thanks for answering.
1. if you have been following this board / any bitcoin board recently i am sure you aware of the contentious segwit2x split.  A long used tactic by "big blockers" is to fill the "mempool" (unconfirmed transactions) with a huge number of transactions.  This type of tactic is not costly if the attacker also has sig hashing power (if controlling 20% hash power, then a &gt;20% probablity you will get your fees back by mining them yourself if you prioritize mining your own transactions). Due to abandoning segwit2x today, these attacks should slow down as miners will now want the network to be as usable as possible to help attract more users (hopefully).
2. Probably the required  fee to get in the next couple blocks is not actually a $5.  It is probably sig less. But in this instance, the third party controlling your keys (exchange), can set whatever fee they want.  
3. There is no set fee for the network.  Wallets can only calculate the fee based recently confirmed trxns / trxns in the mempool.  Many of them are currently programmed to way overestimate fees.  I always set my own fees manually if i am not in a rush, you can get lucky during lull periods, etc. with even very low fees.
4. Bitcoin is super young and underdeveloped.  Almost everyone acknowledges and wants blocks to be able to hold more transactions. Some people just want to go fast and some people want to go more slowly and cautiously and implement more technical solutions to also improve transaction volume.  
5.  You may want to consider other cryptos if you want to do a lot of transactions every day.  Bitcoin is may become kind of like the gold of the crypto world and the "reserve" crypto if you will. Fees will be higher but it is still by a MASSIVE margin the most secure network of its kind.

It is a good question.  If the volume of futures trading on Bitcoin were insignificant, your logic would be very astute.
Right now we are a situation where traders are looking for markets to trade in due to low volatility in traditional asset markets. As a result they are looking for alternative "products" to trade. Now if imagine if you were taking significant long and short positions on product that only has total market cap of $120 billion.  On top of that, it is very thinly traded sincemany of the holders are hodling.  You might realize that  you could just also take actual positions in the product to influence the exchange price. (use rallies, etc.).  This is the key reason why we will have more holders if bitcoin proves to be a popular product to trade.  One cannot sell bitcoin without owning bitcoin.

3. Our defenses will be stronger the next time
4. Our hodles will be greater in number
5. Those that joined us recently have now seen a FUD attack
6. Our miners are being well fed by these attackers. (Even if the attackers are mining many of them back, they still can't mine them all).

@_date: 2017-11-21 00:29:52
I did. :p  Also just want to add this was tongue-in-cheek.  It is a good observation.  But historically surveys have been proven to sometimes have seriously flawed logic, even though experts can't first detect it.  Especially don't read too much into any one survey. Look at the recent presidential election, every poll **knew** Hilary would win.  And there was a lot more investment into those surveys.  The classic example is the telephone holders for telephone polls.
But anyway, even if the survey was 100% accurate. There is a greater issue.  Yes, a huge segment of the pop will never invest in Bitcoin **or** equities because they don't have enough capital.  Generally these people invest in real estate.  This is smart because of the mortgage deduction on your first home. 
Like every other touchpoint, if you only care about the price.  (I don't and hope other people care about more than the price as well).  But if you did only care about the price, it is all about reaching the group of  the 1% that **could** possibly buy bitcoin (some people never will unless the most extreme of scenarios).
But to reach that small group of the 1%, it helps you to also reach the mainstream. As they will influence the 1%.  Not gonna break that part down.  Ya feel me?

Bitcoin right now is best valued as essentially a call option on that major use of bitcoin to do major commerce in **some** market.  It could end up being 8 - 20 different "markets" (depending on how you define).  The software to really value bitcoin is super underdeveloped and the wallets in 5 - 10 years will be capable of so much more, it will be mind-blowing to the average person who is dismissing Bitcoin right now.
Smart people will look back and develop valuation models for crypto's.  The models will appear "obvious" in hindsight.  If anyone has a good valuation technique, they are not yet sharing.

@_date: 2017-11-13 23:11:40
Original source: 
It is an ethos.  Stated simply:  By hodling you are actually likely to earn a greater return than trying to "time" an unregulated market.
A bit longer: Bitcoin is inherently valuable.  We are in the price discovery stage. It is a bootstrapping process.  There are many speculators. You can try to daytrade, but likely you are going to get eaten by exchange fees and whales making coordinate moves in an unregulated market.  If you understand it is inherently valuable and will eventually reach its true value (for many this is much higher than todays price), then you should simply hold onto your coins and not trade.  In that way, you are likely not to miss out on coordinate by buys by wales, etc.
The tend is upward, just hodl.  Trading is MEGA stressful!

Very well said.  If you hodl, your tax burden and tax related compliance will be 0.  No matter what you do, the IRS can't say you didn't comply with the law. Your gains will be taxed at a low rate (potentially 0% depending on your income level).
If you day trade or try to sell high and "buy the dip," your gains are now income and you also have a tax compliance burden.  The more you trade, the more annoying it is to calculate your basis, etc.  
Another great reason to just HODL.

It is a great way to diversify while also helping to increase the value of your holdings. Just FYI the mempool actually cleared down quite a bit.  Almost 90% of 5 - 10 sat/B and maybe lower:
(might be error in data to clear so many 0 - 5 sat/B, but i think it is legit)
In the future you can check the above if you want to get a sense of how much fee is needed.  Also many online merchants will accept 0 confirm transactions, depending on the nature of the item (i.e., many bitpay vendors accept 0 confirms).

"Never get out of the boat"
Some context:
We really are just a PBR boat at the end of the day at a market cap of 100 billion in 2017 IMHO. Those brainwashed by this BCH nonsense are kind of like the Chef looking for mangos in the jungle (even better than traditional BTC returns). They **are** our guys and it is our responsibility to bring them back to the HODLing boat IMHO.  It will take time. But its worth it  as it is still the early days and we need to gather more strength.

So most assets have some type of "initial offering."  For stocks these are IPO's and you are probably familiar with them as retail investors participate.  For bonds and commodities, these are auctions (many different types of auctions from traditional open air to government-bond auctions that occur on a daily basis). 
These helps to determine the initial asset price. Why do these almost always naturally develop in every market ever?  Because the initial owner knows the commodity / bond / asset is worth quite a bit.  But no one is going to step forward and spend a ton of money when no one has ever bought the product before.  So in order to help other buyers' understand the demand (and himself), the auction helps to determine a "fair price" for that particular collection of buyers (the seller will want to populate the auction with as many interested buyers as he can--he often will pay a third party to do / help him do this).  From then on, the buyer may continue to hold auctions at set dates (government bonds) or then sell the good on an on-going basis.  In either case, he can't prevent a secondary market from developing.  In the secondary market, owners of the good sell to each other and they will determine their own price.  This secondary market price is generally referred to as the "market price." (In reality markets are generally fragmented, etc.). 
Bitcoin never had an IPO.  Potential buyers never had to reveal their "true expectations of the value" (i.e. when a bank stops bidding on a govt bond you can implicitly determine its "willingness to pay", which the govt will record to determine supply in future auctions).  So even if I value Bitcoin at $100K, obviously I will never  pay above the market price.  
Bitcoin is currently bootstrapping its own value as real users use it for transacting but also importantly, to preserve purchasing power. IMHO the real value of the token, given its characteristics, is very high.  Especially when you consider how many Chinese billionaires there are, how much money is controlled by organized crime, how much money is gambled online, how much money is moved offshore to evade taxes, etc.  90% of the people in these categories don't yet trust Bitcoin.  They need it to last another 20 years before they come around.  These guys are literally burying gold en masse  for petes' sake (see Binion's the casino operators attempts at preserving their wealth).
We can get in now and watch as these guys get in.  IF you actually believe it will get there.   Just to be clear, I am not saying that is not the "objective" of Bitcoin.  The network is agnostic.  It is many other, great amazing benefits to bring to the world.  But to say people like that won't try to accumulate Bitcoin is also just lying.  And these guys will influence the price more than people in Latin America using it as a land registry...
Also to the pie issue:  so whatever you come into a market at, you tend to use that as your "anchor" price.  So if you came in and saw BItcoin at 5 cents, when it its $10, you probably think it can't go much more.  Same for $10 to $1000, $100 to $10k, etc.  Well its just a human cognitive bias to "anchor" (well studied behavioral finance issue if you want to look it up).  So now Koreans and Japnese are "anchored" at $5k.  Whether or not it is over-valued has nothing to do with the percentage increase / decrease against your anchor price, instead you need to compare current price to your calculated "true price" (based on cash flows for stocks and bonds, based on expectations of resale price for commodities).

JK, but yea I do hear you.  A lot of the pump and dumpers will hurt English only speakers more because they won't always see the planning, etc.

I have been reading the Japanese and Korean bitcoin sites quite a bit over the past two weeks.  The user growth rates and activity growth rates is pretty crazy.  Lots of people going to meet ups and trading live but there are supply shortages.  Just like when it started where I live.  
$5k really helped Bitcoin to hit mainstream again and also help change people's minds about its potential as a store of value.  We are going to see some serious # of new users joining over next 12 months IMHO.  Very large financial investment hedge funds are slowly turning their boats and those turning faster right now are doing **really** well. This will make heads turn.

What makes it a "civil war"?  Was it a civil war when we saw the first major round of scammers created the first gen scamcoins targeted at duping would-be bitcoin investors? (i.e., Litecoin, centralized Ripple tokens, feathercoin, ppcoin, bunch of BS i can't remember, etc.).  If so, then Bitcoin has been in a civil war since at least 2011.
Just because someone says they support Bitcoin doesn't mean it is **true.**  Many of these guys have only been out for themselves since day 1 and don't give a frick about the network or its longterm at all.  Nor do they plan to hodl for the long term. Nor do they care if any decentralized blockchains even exist in 10 years. They just want to appear to be supporters of the Bitcoin ideals so they can convince people to trade their real Bitcoin for their scamcoins.
Don't believe me though.  Do your own research.  Think for yourself.  Read about ASICBoost and why Segwit prevents it.  Think about why Jihan does not want to implement Segwit into BCH.  Think about why there is no transaciton volume on BCH.  Think about why they originally implemented the EDA.  Think about who owns the 100k bitcoin mined on the BCH chain since their fork.  Think about who stands to gain from PNDing BCH.

Yes, it is 100% still early adopter time.  Due to the echo chambers we frequent, we forget the lack of knowledge your "average" person has regarding Bitcoin.  Over time this knowledge will continue to spread and people will understand its characteristics.
Additionally I know many people that want to buy some bitcoin, but they don't trust* startup companies like Coinbase, Gemini, etc.  with their personal info. Once you can purchase bitcoins through fidelity, etrade, and put allocations in your 401k toward Bitcoin, then we will be out of "early adopter."

@_date: 2017-11-14 23:22:24
There can be no forecast because anyone who owns bitcoins and is willing to pay the fees can flood the mempool whenever he / she / it wants. It is a part of being a decentralized system, even actors that want to attack you are still allowed to use the network whenever they want,  however much they want, and without anyone's permission.  The miners do appreciate their fees though.
Really the Bitcoin mempool might be full for the rest of its history (I highly, highly doubt it though. It will likely go back down to near 0 every week in about 3 months).  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  It shows people want to use the network. Right now there is only **one** bitcoin.  There are many imitators, but most people still want the original. 
Before these attacks, the mempool generally always emptied or close to it over a weeklong period.  Many of the volume unfortunately is artificial and is part of a large scale propaganda attack.  But at the end of the day, the high fee market proves that transacting on the Bitcoin network is valuable and it helps test the system against attack.

If you look at GDAX there is a steep sell wall (seems to be coming down as we speak), and not a ton of buyer limit orders near it.  You can see that someone with a lot of coins could probably drop the price by quite a bit with a large market sell.  A person would need a huge market buy to get past $10k at the moment (some of the $10k wall might be spoofed as short sellers know it is an important psychological barrier for Americans). Most of the GDAX traders are Americans and they think the world is America, so they think $10k is extraordinarily significant (not arguing about truth / misperceptions at all here, just stating facts).
On BitFlyer there is a massive amount of limit orders to buy Bitcoins.  (Hover your arrow along the green line to see how many bitcoins could be sold through a theoretical "market sell" and at what price that would drop it to).  If you hover your arrow along the red line you can see how many bitcoins you can buy with a theoretical market buy.  You can see that there are not many Bitcoin limit sell orders (it appears not many sellers in the market based on this information alone).
Many of the Korean exchanges are similar.  If you read the  Korean and Japanese meet up threads through google translate you can see they have tough time getting sellers at market rates.  There is a supply shortage. Arbitrageurs will eventually correct the price differences between the two regions.  But it will take time due to frictions in the legacy fiat system.

The reason people got rich as super early investors is because they understand Bitcoin's value and where it could go when everyone else said it was "unrealistic."  I bet we are still in the same situation, still such a terribly small network given the size of various economies.

No one can prevent speculators from using Bitcoin, just as no one can prevent anyone form using Bitcoin for almost any purpose as long as they follow the rules of the network.
They ultimately do help Bitcoin, because they aid in the price discovery stage and also importantly, they provide liquidity.  Which is actually very important to Bitcoin, more important at this stage than actual use.  They do create bubbles though, we can't prevent though.  Also it is natural for anything bootstrapping to this huge of a value.
We aren't ready for mainstream use.  We need a few years of development, especially on the software side.  At that point, when the tech is more mature, the transaction volume will be a much more important metric.

Haha, enjoy the high now good sir. I hold both so don't really care too much which horse wins. But just remember this attack is more expensive than it may appear and if it fails to break the 1MB chain, it is just 1 more attack in a long series at this point...  It is very difficult to unseat the incumbent when everyone is calling it "Bitcoin" and most traditional stuff involving holding cryptos is exclusively Bitcoin related (BitcoinIRA, etc.). 
After the mempool comes back down after the difficulty adjustment (and it will), I have a feeling the backlog will come down. After that some normalcy will return and newbies will likely flow back to bitcoin.  We'll see though!  It was a helluva  play they put together and now the buying over the past month makes a lot more sense, but it might be tougher than they thought.

But BCH doesn't scale that well either.  Even if you used 8MB blocks (which would seriously impact full node counts, block propagation time, etc.), it still can't handle VISA level transactions.  But BCH is less secure, it doesn't have many experienced developers (see hardfork to fix EDA).
BTC can't be used as currency now, that is definitely true.  Give it and the supporting software 2 - 3 years.  BTC's value comes from what it **could** become.  Trading the network security for short term convenience is not that wise.  We need greater scaling solutions than just raising the block size.

It is such a nascent technology that we are in the price discovery phase.  For Bitcoin to achieve any of the "objectives" that others project onto the network, then it will have to be much, much bigger.  
Price speculators actually help us get there faster.  They also provide liquidity.  The software needed to fully utilize the bitcoin network has not yet been created.  That is the main thing holding bitcoin back.  Once we have that and a larger market cap, then we can move to the closed loop economy phase.  We aren't there yet and it will take time. It is actually worse to try to rush it.

Good point. But honestly when you (from their perspective) are asking someone to part with their hardearned cash on something very risky---I think the key barrier is related to actually making that jump from bitcoin researcher to first time bitcoin buyer.  Becuase getting through the initial ID verification, etc. is the main obstacle that prevents people IMHO.
Its nice to jump on a forum that would be (if not for shills), full of bitcoin promoters for a little bit of validation before you make that hurdle. Especially considering **most** people will have almost everyone in their life telling them it is a fraud / ponzi / too late.

Sometimes a temporary lapse can be very costly.
Bitcoin is still in its childhood and we need to keep developing the infrastructure and ecosystem.  There will be more challenges ahead.  More powerful actors will attack bitcoin. 
Also don't forget that you can promote bitcoin and help it even without holding it. But if you are going to hold, then hodl:

Lol, that is pretty unlikely at this point.  People have been actively trying to find that flaw since 2009.  There were some initially.  Now people could short and make BILLIONS if they found it. 
Maybe like .001% chance the network could be taken down temporarily, but no one can break elliptical curve cryptography without some crazy advances in math. And for that reason, they can't ever spend your bitcoins without your private key.
Could drop quite a bit overnight for a lot of other reasons, but a "flaw discovered" is truly not likely at this stage. (If Bitcoin Core continues with being careful.  If we go fast like Ethereum, you are right it would introduce risk.

If traders like trading Bitcoin, volume will grow (and traders generally like volatility).  Traders will know that they can always also influence the price of the underlying at the exchanges with ease.  But in order to sell bitcoins, one must first own bitcoins.  
Also shorting bitcoin has been shown to be very foolish so I think most will go long at least initially.  At around 50k, the shorting side will start to really matter though.

Anyone tells you that there is a "right way" to Bitcoin is lying to you.  Bitcoin is protocol. It is a network.  It is a social movement.  It has no "objective."  No one controls it.  The creator intentionally avoided taking stances related to politics, etc.
Many people that want to use it to preserve or increase purchasing power (i.e. make GAINZ), suggest that you should hodl so long that you can just spend your Bitcoin.
Where you can use Bitcoins:  Overstock.com (can buy almost anything you can buy on Amazon); Steam; many many others.  What are your hobbies? 
Many companies offer a service for vendors to accept Bitcoin and then instantly convert to their currency of choice so they are not exposed to risks associated with holding cryptocurrencies. 


Yes, if you think of owning Bitcoin only as a store of value / investment / gamble.  Then you should calculate the expected value of holding it (for whatever your time horizon is).  Many people believe it has the potential to go up 100x in price.  IF that is true, if it goes up 100x only 2% of the time, but fails 98% of the time.  **It would still be an amazing investment.** (if 20% of 10x, and 80% of failure, it would be amazing investment, etc.).


There are many bitcoins located throughotu the world.  A quick google serach should help locate some in your area.  If you provide your general location, I can suggest some trusted exchanges.

First, please everyone concede that it is EXTREMELY difficult to moderate effectively in a Bitcoin forum.
1. There HAS to be a line in the sand about what constitutes alt-coin talk and where to stop it. Otherwise the forum will simply always be flooded shills for whatever new scamcoin the pump and dumpers are promoting. I think the line might
be a bit overally aggro at times, but I think overall its at a reasonable compromise.  The mods actively promote the other subs for discussions about all of the scamcoins run on very insecure networks (also with centralized dev teams generally).
2.  Reddit isn't the best forum for very serious technical discussion about an on-going issue.  Satoshi used the internet forum format for a reason.  Reddit is better to help stay current on recent news, events, etc.
3. I have been censored and banned on both so I understand the frustration, but mods are just people at the end of the day... I don't have any ill will towards anyone over it. 
4. Any censorship on centralized forums reinforces the need for decentralized systems.
I was super into Bitcoin 2012 - 2014 but then life got real busy for 2014 - 2017 so I couldn't follow it too closely.  As a result I never really got super antagonistic / entrenched with any group or developed much hate for our own community.  It is really sad
that originally we would always go to  happy hours after a meet-up or whatever and just enjoyed knowing other bitcoiners and now we are so divided, but the fifth column attack was always the most dangerous attack vector for Bitcoin.  So we must meet this challenge
and continue to fight and try to get everyone co-existing and working together towards common aims, and Bitcoin will never return to that stage and so be it.

So since the dawn of time man has used various mediums of exchanges for commerce.  Generally markets trend towards mediums with the following characteristics:  high durability; limited supply (naturally or artificially), lightweight, able to be secured (either due to durability such as rai stones or due to small size such as paper money). Bitcoin has many characteristics that make it a great medium of exchange.  
Obviously the medium has to actually be used to have value.  People have worked to develop the "Bitcoin economy" for he past 7 years.  It was a tremendously uphill struggle with massive resistance.  There is still a lot of climbing left. 
Bitcoin's main strength over alts:  unknown founder (super important); much better brand name reconigition, real commerce and users holding, market cap large enough to allow hedge funds / others to invest; safest, most battle-tested network (super important for anything trying to be a medium of exchange); awesome price history; no one holding massive amounts of coins with insider knowledge about future development prospects and developments; etc.  There are many more.
Other blockchains will definitely solver other problems.  To me, Bitcoin and Bcash will likely win for a while as a the "gold" of the cryptoworld for some time.  I think other coins will be successful, but I am not sure they have been created yet.  Just like the dot come era, there  were a ton of way overvalued projects with bad developers / vaporware / straight up run by scammers.
Like ethereum, I think its cool and all.  But PoW --&gt; PoS is super unproven with a lot of theoretical and practical issues. Also the founder being know is a big issue.  I think someone could come in and write a better Ehtereum for sure.  But will someone write a better Bitcoin that is so much better than it can also unseat its status as the cyrptogold?  I don't know.  As long as the network remains very strong and the highest difficulty, i think Bitcoin is safe.

"Calvin Ayre got his start in shady insider trading deals where he was ordered by a court to stay away from stock exchanges for 20 years. Next in life he was involved in drug smuggling where he ultimately snitched on his crew and ran off with the money and started Bodog. A poster on gambling chat forums by the name of Paddy was the pilot who got busted smuggling when Ayre snitched, Paddy has dedicated his life to exposing Ayre for the crook he is (chat forums such as Major Wager, Peeps Place, and The RX).
Bodog is known as a loser only sportsbook where winning sharp players are shown the door. They are also well known for partaking in an act known as dealing dual lines, this is where they move the line on an event 1/2 point from market price in the books favor and sharp players who bet the profitable side of the bet are profiled and eventually dealt a different line.
Needless to say Calvin Ayre is a shady ass one way motherfucker who is always out for himself. Anything he is associated with is shady as fuck. I was no fan of BCH before but now I know 100% beyond doubt that I want no parts of it.

@_date: 2017-11-07 01:54:56
But my point is that even if they do have better "technology" than Bitcoin. It is more these quesitons:
1. Does the bitcoin network still work and can it still be used for commerce?
2. Is the coin's technology **so superior** that it can unseat Bitcoin's network effect? 
Even if 2 is true, if 1 holds then likely co-exist for an extended period.  2 will likely win the long run.  If 1 fails, then most cryptocurrencies will fail for a long time and its better to hold none.  To the mainstream for the next 3 - 5 years:  bitcoin = cyrptocurrency.  If it fails, we won't be able to grow large enough for a sustainable network.
The launch of Bitcoin was very "fair" because most people heard about them while less than $100.  No one is in control and no one has a huge premine.  For these and may other reasons, altcoins have a super long road ahead of them (like 95% will fail or will be used but won't support the current valuations IMHO).

This is the issue many journalists fail to understand / articulate.  The public KEYS are the important part.  An address that has never sent coins is quantum secure.  It has never revealed its public key.  Only if you SPEND bit coins from the address (and thereby revealing the public key), is the theoretical quantum attack **possible.**  (Again, would require probably at least a decade).  There have been plenty of great articles written though if you google.

It occurred some time ago.  If you had your coins stored on coinbase, they will give you the amount of BCH equal to the BTC you had at the time of the fork.
Basically some people figured out that if they concentrated a large amount of mining power geographically on an internet system that was more tightly connected to each other than the rest of the world, they could cheat at mining in Bitcoin in a very clever way.  They did this. Bitcoin developers created something that prevented this.  They didn't like that. They created a copy of bitcoin and started calling it bitcoin and telling others to call it bitcoin.
They have been using a lot of persuasive arguments to convince people to support Bitcoin cash, but this is the primary motivation of the people that want to see Bitcoin cash succeed.

Stocks are ownership claims to real companies.  These companies design, manufacture and sell real products.  They have financials audited by independent third parties who charge a fkton of money to audit.  
Their intrinsic value is based on the amount of cash flows they generate it.  People are paid a shit ton of money  to refine these valuations all day.  Greater fool theory appears to non-cash flow generating assets for which you depend on a seller to purchase the asset at a higher price.  
Stocks are basically on the opposite end of the spectrums from commodities.

From an earlier post today:
I've never understood the whole "waiting for a dip" thing. Sure, opportunistically buy dips; but waiting often just means you'll end up buying higher than you would have.
Imagine BTC is at $6500. You think, "oh, I'll wait for the next dip". It keeps going up and up, and eventually at $7200, it turns around and goes down for a bit. It levels out at $6800 and then shows signs of starting to rise again. At $6850, you 'buy the dip', congratulating yourself on saving compared to the $7200 price. However if you'd just bought at $6500, you'd be better off.
Of course, you can't know what the future dip will be and whether it'll be higher or lower than right now, but assuming you actually agree with and accept the general proposition that the long term trend is up for quite a while to come and are therefore hodling rather than just day trading, then buying now seems a far safer bet than not.

No, Americans are super afraid people will panic around $10k.  It becomes a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.  But Asian markets are just following normal supply and demand without this psychological barrier.  As a result they rocketed past that price level based on current spot FX rates (historically they moved more closely to USD markets).
Based on current spot exchange rates, the prices of Bitcoin being sold are as follows: 
Asian prices are currently "leading" American prices.  This will cause people to buy Bitcoins from American markets, move them to Asian markets and sell Bitcoins there.  Over time the prices will converge.

Yes sir.  But you raise a good point.  The white paper is important for understanding the underlying aspect of the blockchain / why a high number of confirmations are more secure, etc. It does not aim to get  explain every corner case / nuance of the system. It explains the POC which is **essential** for truly grasping what Bitcoin is.  The exact implementation should be changed and modified over time based on experienced.  That it is why it should be interpreted as a  detailed implementation roadmap, it is the start of an open source project.  The first step in a journey.

Totally believe this, but to me it seems surprising that so many people are buying into this hardfork FUD. 
No matter what happens, its like 99.9% that bitcoin1x will continue to be operational and mineable. Like 1% the price might be so low the next set of blocks til the difficulty adjustment could be a bad period.  Maybe extremely low likelihood some unanticipated interactions cause the network to unusable for a period.  But in 100% of all scenarios, no one can move your well-confirmed Bitcoins to which you control the private key. 
Bitcoin has hardforked many times, and other than a bunch of get-rich quick types jumping ship, I am not seeing what the major worries are... Best case, enough clowns are convinced Bitcoin2x is actually worth something long enough to increase your BTC holdings.
Sure price might crash, but we have never, we cannot, and we will never be able to prevent people from speculating on Bitcoin. (For the same reason we can't control anyone / anything from using Bitcoin for any purpose as long as they follow the network's rules).

Bitpay and other companies used to set up pretty much everything a vendor would need to receive bitcoin and their conversion to USD was cheaper than cc fees.
I haven't followed the that segment for the past 2 - 3 yrs, but I believe several companies offer this service.  You can probably get a reduced fee or other perks if you can talk to a sales person / business development person there.  Don't be afraid to ask.

1. Never again sign a trxn from a computer connected computer.  Only sign transaction with offline computers.
2.  Redeem your bitcoin fork tokens from this wallet.  Your private key are exposed, but the attacker may not have redeemed your forked tokens, at least it is something.
3.  At the very least buy a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:25:21
It is interesting because you posted yesterday **specifically** asking about redeeming Bitcoin Cash from a paper wallet.  Then today, this theft supposedly occurred.  You don't have a tx id of course.  (You also then deleted your original post regarding your questions about redeeming Bitcoin cash and you claim you have never tried to redeem any Bitcoin fork tokens).  
You have also spammed many forums about this, but never once posted the tx id.  
Anyway, if you are a genuine  user (and I do sincerely apologize for being skeptical as the amount of alt-coin shills has been off the charts the past 4 days.  Very old accounts suddenly becoming active like yours are super, massive coincidence this days). I believe the attack likely came  from bitaddress.org.  According to your post on Aug 17,  "worked it out! Thanks guys, was what you said, i entered into bitaddress.org and it gave me the uncompressed which worked"  A use had advised you to use that webiste.  If you didn't download it offline or ever plugged that computer back into the internet, bitaddress.org could theoretically steal your bitcoin.

Original source: 
It is an ethos. Stated simply: By hodling you are actually likely to earn a greater return than trying to "time" an unregulated market.
A bit longer: Bitcoin is inherently valuable. We are in the price discovery stage. It is a bootstrapping process. There are many speculators. You can try to daytrade, but likely you are going to get eaten by exchange fees and whales making coordinate moves in an unregulated market. If you understand it is inherently valuable and will eventually reach its true value (for many this is much higher than todays price), then you should simply hold onto your coins and not trade. In that way, you are likely not to miss out on coordinate by buys by wales, etc.
The tend is upward, just hodl. Trading is MEGA stressful!

Hello, I am a concerned user.  I have been mining bitcoin since the genesis block in 2007.  I love bitcoin but I just sent $5.53 of Bitcoin to pay for a cup of coffee.  I have been waiting at this coffee stand for over 5 days, waiting for my 2 sat/B transaction to confirm.  I may soon **starve to death** if Core doesn't raise the block size soon!
Does core realize that Bitcoin is ENDANGERING PEOPLES LIVES by not raising the blocksize.  THIS IS NOT OKAY~~
Stating tomorrow I will create hardfork called BitIdiotsOnly.  I have worked with my super large (but also super, super secret) dev team. They  said forking the Bitcoin code and replacing it with a 100,000 TB block should take about 3 - 5 weeks.  During those 3 - 5 weeks only I will be able to mine BitIdiotsOnly.  The difficulty **may** be lowered durign that period.  Maybe, i will only do it if it makes the coin BETTER. 
 
Why 100,000 TB you ask?  Our proprietary research at BitIdiotsOnly shows that if we raise the block size to 100,000 TB we can fit all the world's transactions for the NEXT FIVE YEARS in ONE BLOCK. 
CHECKMATE BITCOIN!!! (Also if the price starts to decline I will just keep lowering the difficulty.  If we end up mining all 21 million coins super quickly but still have no transactions, I will just raise the block reward to increase the reward for ~~myself~~ hardworking miners.

To put it simply: this quantum BS is pure FUD.  It is based upon attacking people that don't understand fully all of the mathematics and cryptographic aspects of Bitcoin. 
This issue has been considered and written about since 2010.  Many article outline very clearly and explicitly the potential threats and how we would proceed. Even this sensationalist article with the title "Quantum Computers Pose Imminent Threat to Bitcoin Security," admits that POW is not at risk for at leats 10 years and  “The elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027,” say Aggarwal and co.  Now that is **only** for spending bitcoins from addresses that the public key has been revealed, if you use use an address that has never spent coins, then it is still quantum resistant!
Based on your question, you seem to have a very bad misunderstanding of how we would make Bitcoin quantum resistant though. There would be no need to "go back" and change any prior transactions.  Those can't be changed, and if you think they can be by an attacker, you need to read the basics of Bitcoin again.  It would be a voluntary movement based on a BIP to move to a new address format based on a quantum resistant signature. 
If you think I am wrong though, please short Bitcoin and make BILLIONS.  Enjoy your yacht and personal island in 5 years!

Not the commenter but am a fan of science and technology. He clearly said fundamentals of science and technology.  Bitcoin is primarily a product of strong computer science, cryptographic advances and a seminal, logical solution to a long-studied problem.*
But now that you mention it, Bitcoin does have fundamentals.  No one has determined what they are yet, but looking back really overpaid "smart" people will act like they should have been "obvious" to anyone.  One is most likely the # of **new** users per day.

Someone probably saw an opportunity to make a play by taking a short position on a specific exchange.

She was right.

People still keep thinking of Bitcoin as a traditional asset.  When clueless people keep pouring money in, the asset becomes worth way more than its cash flows justify.
Bitcoin doesn't have this issue, adoption actually **helps** its value.  But people just rely on heuristics and don't think it through.  Most people view Bitcoin like a "stock" even though it is a bearer asset and most definitely not.

Honestly if there weren't people trying to maliciously take over the current network with their own chain, transaction fees would probably be way, way lower. It's kind of like when you let a 8 year just throw a tantrum and tire themselves out.  Even they have a limit to the energy, you just have to wait them out.  
is it ideal? no.  would it be better if we could go faster? yea, probably.  but its not worth trading the security of the network for short term convenience. 
Look at Vitalik's chain that is always spending its tiem and energies working on rollbacks due to unanticipated attacks / interactions, etc.

No.  Anyone can "hardfork" Bitcoin whenever they want, and no one can stop them.  I am just copying the ledger and creating my own network based on a new set of rules. Bitcoin, the honeybadger, won't care. It won't  notice. Real bitcoin nodes and miners will continue to operate uninterrupted. Other people might not even notice I created a new network.  Segwit2x is a little obnoxious because for a very short period after the fork, it might confuse some wallets into thinking they received Bitcoins when really they received Segwit2x.  Also there a few other corner cases, but the key is if you don't need to **transact** in that 24 - 48 hour period, you are set.  Just make sure you have control of your private keys before the fork and you are totally set. 
Its possible the network might need some minor tweaks to help prevent any ill-effects of hostile hardforks that intentionally try to trick real nodes, but this will be the first fork of this type, and it might be totally unsuccessful.  This one is dangerous because it has some powerful actors supporting it.
Some people speculate that people may trade real Bitcoins or Fiat for Segwit2x token, no one knows for certainty.  People thought Bitcoin Gold would be worth something, but its futures tanked almost immediately after the "snapshot."  If you control the private keys to your Bitcoins before the fork though, you can just watch the fireworks and not worry (the value of the Segwit2x is also an implicit bet on the token's network continuing to exist, theoretically we could have Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Segwit2x all co-existing, but 2 will probably trend towards zero)
Also just a note:  no one person / institution backs Bitcoin.  Every exchange could close and refuse your business.  Every seller could refuse to buy your bitcoins.  The same is true with gold, collector's items, expensive art, etc. It is not a realistic scenario in most cases, but the key idea is that the market determines the price, not a government or "backer." So no one can split up the price of a Bitcoin and make each worth $3k, because no one controls the price to begin with.

Definitely agree with that bitcoin is not a ponzi.  A ponzi relies on fraud and deception from a central authority in order to continue the scheme and attract new entrants. Bitcoin cannot be that because it is open source and it is clear how it operates.
Bitcoin's value comes from its attributes as a medium of exchange.  Of which they are include:
permisionless; can be initiated within 5 seconds, confirmed on average in 5 - 45 mins approx 90% of the time; minimal security costs; difficult to seize; easy to store over long time periods with no maintenance costs; dead man's switches available; time lock available; annuity setup available; M of N signing possible; etc.

It is such a nascent technology that we are in the price discovery phase. 
The software to interact with the bitcoin network is super underdeveloped.  It will take a good 5 - 10 years for bitcoin network's more sophisticated uses to be realized (smart contracts, use in annuities, dead man's switches, etc.).  It is all possible now, but the software and user acceptance isn't there yet.
If that is unacceptable to you,  I would not recc getting involved in Bitcoin.

They have a big incentive, they mined almost 100k coins when no one was even using the chain. But I think they knew this weekend was their best shot, we will see.

Basically some people figured out that if they concentrated a large amount of mining power geographically on an internet system that was more tightly connected to each other than the rest of the world, they could cheat at mining in Bitcoin in a very clever way. They did this. Bitcoin developers created something that prevented this (segwit). They didn't like that. They created a copy of bitcoin and started calling it bitcoin and telling others to call it bitcoin.
They have been using a lot of persuasive arguments to convince people to support Bitcoin cash, but this is the primary motivation of the people that want to see Bitcoin cash succeed.
Even some of the most ardent supporters of bitcoin cash do not realize this, but this is a very real truth.

Creating a bid and cancelling before it is executed != spoofing.  The naked eye observing bids cannot detect spoofing.
5 years I would agree with you that spoofing occurs frequently and **might** be the part of the playbook of a smaller desk / boutique prop that is willing to make high risk plays / gray area plays  Still any well respected trader with a proven track record has not relied on spoofing to build his track record (it is 100% easy to detect when looking backwards on a trader's trades).
2 years ago I might agree with you that spoofing would and still does occur. Today I am confident that the participants on CME will not be regularly spoofing with large buy and sell walls. 
From Wiki:
In the U.S. Department of Justice April 21, 2015 complaint of market manipulation and fraud laid against Navinder Singh Sarao, dubbed the Hounslow day-trader appeared "to have used this 188-and-289-lot spoofing technique in certain instances to intensify the manipulative effects of his dynamic layering technique...The purpose of these bogus orders is to trick other market participants and manipulate the product's market price." He employed the technique of dynamic layering, a form of market manipulation in which traders "place large sell orders for contracts" tied to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index. 
In July 2013 the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) brought a milestone case against spoofing which represents the first Dodd-Frank Act application.[1] A federal grand jury in Chicago indicted Panther Energy Trading and Michael Coscia, a high-frequency trader. In 2011 Coscia placed spoofed orders through CME Group Inc. and European futures markets with profits of almost $1.6 million. Coscia was charged with six counts of spoofing with each count carrying a maximum sentence of ten years in prison and a maximum fine of one million dollars.[6] The illegal activity undertaken by Coscia and his firm took place in a six-week period from "August 8, 2011 through October 18, 2011 on CME Group’s Globex trading platform."[1] They used a "computer algorithm that was designed to unlawfully place and quickly cancel orders in exchange-traded futures contracts." They placed a "relatively small order to sell futures that they did want to execute, which they quickly followed with several large buy orders at successively higher prices that they intended to cancel. By placing the large buy orders, Mr. Coscia and Panther sought to give the market the impression that there was significant buying interest, which suggested that prices would soon rise, raising the likelihood that other market participants would buy from the small order Coscia and Panther were then offering to sell."[1]
Britain's FCA is also fining Coscia and his firm approximately $900,000 for "taking advantage of the price movements generated by his layering strategy" relating to his market abuse activities on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. They earned US$279,920 in profits over the six weeks period "at the expense of other market participants – primarily other High Frequency Traders or traders using algorithmic and/or automated systems."[1]
Listen,  the guys trading this are just doing it due to pressure from clients / honestly it is a bit gimmicky.  Every single business / firm / whatever is trying to seem like they are staying on top and are head of the tech trends.  This is one such attempt by the Duff.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:11:55
Bitcoin has no objective.  No one is in charge.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:56:37
FYI you will **not** see spoofed buy and sell walls on the CME futures market. The traders and brokers are known, registered, and are complying with US securities law (due to CME's location in the US) AND their own local securities laws based on the location of their company. These people are not going to risk their professional reputations, their business' licenses, their personal licenses, etc. on that type of BS.  Especially since they built their careers &amp; reputations in other markets and are just offering bitcoin primarily due to popular demand. 
Spoofing is easy to detect when all trades are detected and all actors are known.  There will of course still be huge large buy and sell walls, but **not** spoofing like is extremely common on Bitcoin exchanges.

Put 2FA on your Coinbase and take other security precautions.
Continue to research Bitcoin and how to create offline wallets, etc.  When you are 100% confident you know what you are doing, transfer it to your own wallet.
Coinbase is perfectly reasonable wallet for any amounts under 8 Bitcoins IMHO.  Just go slow and don't be rushed.  Practice with smaller amounts before moving your whole stash.

People that are hodlers today are generally OK with spending.  They just feel that the current price level doesn't reflect Bitcoin's true value.  
It is just Gresham's law to spend the "bad currency" and hold onto the good currency.  It would be ideal if hodlers also bought everything in bitcoin, but its not essential.

First: It is not the aim of Bitcoin to be the "primary" currency.  It doesn't need to be.  It is just public ledger.  Bitcoin themselves scan be used as a medium of exchange for various purposes.   Other individuals may try to use Bitcoin for certain ends or claim what its "objective" is, that doesn't mean they are correct.  Bitcoin could certainly be a useful tool even if it was only worth $100 each.
Second: Simply false assertion.  You can  have a "primary currency" / "good currency" while bad currencies exist.  it has happened many times historically.
I personally do not think that bitcoin is that great for in person transactions and won't ever be.  That is totally fine.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:25:17

I wouldn't disagree with you 3 - 4 years ago.  The toughest part for Bitcoin was going $0 --&gt; $1k.  At this point it is a very capable medium of exchange that is censorship resistant and very expensive to attack.  The attributes of the medium are quite amazing:  can't be counterfeited, can be sent to any location in the world, don't have to ask for permission from anyone or anything, can send very large amounts of money at low cost, and no chargebacks.

The risk that the exchange pulls a MTGOX during that period is not nonzero, but neither is the messing up controlling your own keys.

The value of any medium of exchange, primarily comes from the value and utility of its NETWORK.  Right now the current "market cap" of Bitcoin is ~100 Billion USD (which is impressive due to the recent USD bull run).  This "market cap" is a huge misnomer.  The best way to think about that number is that the Bitcoin network currently stores $100 billion in value for its users based on the current exchange prices. 
If you live in the first world, with a stable currency and ability to move your capital about.  You may not understand as well why access to bitcoin and being able to send value to ANYONE, ANYWHERE, WHENEVER has such a value.  Bitcoin's utility and its ecosystem are what give it its value.

1. Encouraging one new entrant joining as a holder is much different than saying that EVERY SINGLE USER should instantly become exclusively a holder. Don't spend bitcoin because someone told you to. Don't spend bitcoin because you want to increase its value.  Spend bitcoin because **you** get value from using it over another form of payment.  Spend Bitcoins because you want to.  Spend Bitcoins because Bitcoins represent self sovereignty and you want to exert it. Spend Bitcoins for its convenience / safety in particular situations. 
Some holders are certainly good and needed (a large number is even better).  To say that holders do not help bitcoin is incorrect.  They are helping to perform price discovery and IMHO  they also help spur further investments into the security of the network (encourages new mining entrants).
2. How often do people actually spend gold? Being able to be spent easily and with no transaction costs is an important characteristic of a potential medium of exchange / store of value, but it is not the only characteristic. Bitcoin could well become the "reserve currency" of the cryptoworld but that is not a terrible fate.

The price of Bitcoin + BitcoinSegWit2x will probably be greater than the price of "Bitcoin" at the time of the split.  By owning bitcoins now you will get tokens on both chains.  It is probably a good idea to sell BitcoinSegwit2x immediately after the split.
The price of Bitcoins on the legacy chain that will have 1 MB blocks may drop right after the fork.  Then again once people realize that Bitcoin has survived many prior hard forks without skipping a beat and just did the same with that one... The price could moon for a good bit.

Younger people are very into bitcoin but they don't have much disposable income.  During the holiday season older people (throughout the world) give wealth to the younger generation, which allows them to buy bitcoin.
Sure they buy small amounts, but a very large amount of people buying small amounts adds up quickly in a market where many people are hodling until they believe the price better approximates bitcoin's true value.  Another good example would be the fundraising efforts of Bernie Sanders.  If an idea resonates with a large group of people, even if they can't individually contribute much, it can add up very quickly.

Holding does help Bitcoin.  You are helping the network to store additional value.  You are also helping Bitcoin to get closer to its true long-term value, which is necessary for long term survival although doesn't have to be immediate.

I would definitely agree that today the cc is much better for travelling. However, if you have travelled extensively with a business AmEx, some other high rewards cc, etc. you will know that many merchants will refuse to accept it due to the higher merchant fees. Some percentage of merchants also refuse to accept cc's in general for the same reason in certain regions of the world.
If bitcoins becomes widespread enough with enough easy to use Merchant UI's so that any mom and pop store can easily accept bitcoins, I guarantee you they would prefer their customers to use Bitcoin.  Once they have that incentive, these merchants will become part of the Bitcoin network and help promote bitcoin over time. We aren't there yet and we may never be.  Its worth a shot to some of us though.

Definitely equities are in a very large bubble right now (not all companies), but current P/Es for many companies make zero sense.
I think when the fed finally has to raise interest rates (and eventually they do have to), it is likely to be an important trigger for the next correction in the equities. This will be a great environment for bitcoin to thrive within.

Honestly Btcgold won't be worth that much.  If it ends up being worth anything, I am highly confident eventually coinbase will make it available.  So you are likely losing out on about a 0.1%ish return in the likely scenario that it becomes near worthless.
In the scenario that it does succeed, I personally do think Coinbase will make them available (purely from a self-serving pov on their end).
I would just focus on making sure you have control of your private keys before the segwit2x fork (mid November).
EDIT:  And  yes, likely just reasonable paranoia involved with dealing with a new, valuable medium of exchange.  Take your time and don't have to send it all at once or all to the same place.

Hmmm.... I am not sure I am following.  You bring up a good pt regarding countries turning to Bitcoin.  Do you know what those citizens are also hoarding and were hoarding historically? Frequently US dollars. Any valuable medium of exchange that stores value well will be used by people seeking such a vehicle. This behavior does not hurt the network itself.  It actually often provides liquidity for current owners, that is a positive for users.
I am not going to argue about "who is doing more for Bitcoin" because that implies that Bitcoin has a specific objective.  I do not believe that. 
Just FYI many people that "bought in at a penny" have dedicated significant portions of their lives helping to build the infrastructure you now enjoy.  In spite of **everyone they knew** telling them it was BS, scam, Ponzi, etc. they still dedicated themselves to what they believed.  They deserve everything they earn IMHO.

That is correct although it is a very ballpark number, I have no idea what it will be worth (just I think its unlikely to be signficiant relative to BTC's current price).  Bear in mind you will also have to pay bitcoin miner's fees as well as fees to the exchange where you trade them. These costs will also erode the return. The smaller your investment, the more significant these costs.
If you really want them, you have plenty of time to research, (especially today and tomorrow) before the fork, you just gotta put some time in. (It ain't rocket science).
