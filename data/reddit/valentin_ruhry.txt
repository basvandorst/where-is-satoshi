Yes, it worked before.
@_date: 2014-07-30 00:23:09
I'll forward this to him. I think he'll actually appreciate the comment.
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:15:33
Thanks. Did you take the image? Could I use it for a presentation?
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:07:20
I always enjoy reading comments from Bitcoiners about Contemporary art. They sound very much like what the trolls on usually post about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:52:40
It´s negotiable, but we try to get 30% to be save in case we need to pay out of our own pockets when the price crashes and the artist wants FIAT (which is an option). We had some pretty serious investments so far for legal advice and forming a limited liability corporation - this was necessary as there is no precedent and we didn't want to get fucked!
Edit: For those who didn't know, the standard cut is 50% for the galleries and 50% for the artist.
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:46:57


I'm referring to this.
@_date: 2014-05-31 01:32:08
We don't plan to have a gallery space, rather want to explore the possibilities of the combination contemporary art/internet/bitcoin. The networking/exclusivity aspect is important, that is true: Contrary to some existing platforms, the focus on Cointemporay is to curate shows. We select specific pieces/artists, communicate with the artists/galleries and at a later point also invite curators to show artists in their name on our site.
There's a case in the future, where we will be showing a work from a european artist, that is actually on display in a US gallery during our presentation. We find it exciting to see what is possible and are also happy to realize how interested galleries are.
@_date: 2014-07-23 07:26:06
Does he accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-25 19:26:09
Just like standards, tastes differ. Thanks for your input though.
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:53:12
This is true. Works by Beat Streuli in this format are valued in this price range.
Edit: Typo
@_date: 2014-07-16 21:50:46
Well then, what keeps you from purchasing this fantastic art work? While the future BTC price is hard to predict, it's pretty clear that this work will be worth much more in a few years (check out the artists CV).
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:50:34
I saw that, but thought that it would generate a new address.
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:30:00
Haha. Love this.
@_date: 2014-10-20 21:53:59
It's actually a pretty decent price for an artist with such a career.
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:47:28
We are big fans of his work and our primary goal is not to make a quick buck out of it but to show and curate artists and artworks we like.
But thanks for your input, it is very appreciated.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:24:18
I wouldn't know the answer to that either. So what's wrong with asking?
@_date: 2014-07-30 06:06:22
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:20:50
Contemporary Art and Bitcoin are very alike. As an artist, this was one of the most surprising discoveries when I looked into Bitcoin.
Nobody here can really explain why the price of 1 BTC is about 600 USD at the moment and there is almost no regulation in the Bitcoin world. But still we have found ways of measuring (or at least trying to) its value. We can look into the numbers of user, Bitcoins, the market value, what people are willing to spend on exchanges etc.
Theoretically the same applies for the art world: there is almost no regulation and it's impossible to evaluate artworks but still people are trying to find ways of evaluating an artwork, that is mostly also connected to the artist. What materials are used, what size, how old is the work, etc. Also, where did the artist study or which school was he in, what exhibitions has he had, etc.
If an artists work is featured in a certain collection, one that e.g. also has works by 'famous' artists, the price for his works goes up. But overall one has to decide for their self if they like something or not.
That's why with every artwork we post, we also publish a [CV]( If you have a closer look at Max' CV, you will see, that he is still quite young, but has already shown with some reputable galleries and he was also awarded with an award from the City of Bremen, Germany. If you weight this into the price, you'll actually realize that the work is still rather inexpensive.
@_date: 2014-07-22 22:24:50
As an artist and BTC enthusiast this is exciting news. Too bad [Cointemporary]( is not mentioned in any of these articles.
Hey, if you also want to invest in us, we'd even accept BTC! ;-)
Edit: one word due to auto-correct
@_date: 2014-07-29 23:38:19
Thanks man. We are still curating the works ourselves, writing artists and galleries directly, but are also planning to invite curators to pick their artists.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:12:58
I don't see it so. In the exhibition, there is a large wall text explaining the show, mentioning Bitcoin and concepts of decentralization.
It is very short-sighted to think, that the only way to reach a broader audience and introduce them to Bitcoin is to set up BTC-ATMs and hand out stickers.
@_date: 2014-05-30 05:16:17
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:54:30


Still there is some objectivity in it. Factually your ~$25 version would never be evaluated higher than Schaffer´s original work.


I am saying that I could make this piece of art myself for around ~$25, and I would be more intersted in doing that, than paying more than 50x that for someone else to do it for me.
Yes, but what you'd have then is only a work inspired by another artist. It will never be the original. I understand that you don´t care about it, as you might just want to decorate your bedroom with it (okay, probably not even that). But there are people that will want to own the original work. In a way: an original work is *Bitcoin* and all copies of it, that can be reprinted on demand are *FIAT*. Got it? ;-)
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:29:36
If you don't understand something, it's always easier to belittle it than trying to understand. Ironically it is something that bitcoiners usually criticize their opponents for.
@_date: 2014-07-09 18:51:07
Yeah, I'm sorry. I couldn't resist... ;-)
@_date: 2014-07-02 21:03:19
Good article. I have always thought that if somebody was crazy enough to *invest* into BTC he might as well be crazy enough to do so with art. ;-)
Edit: added link.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:40:42
I have actually talked to Philipp about this and I disagree with you. If he wasn't combining a TV screen with a canvas and instead only used a TV *or* a canvas (what many artists do), nobody would complain. He always uses different clips on the screen and prints different things on the canvas, every work is in itself very different to the previous work.
What's the problem with that?
@_date: 2014-07-02 20:15:36
It is a contemporary art piece by Anetta Mona Chişa &amp; Lucia Tkáčová who have been exhibited at the 54 Biennale di Venezia in 2011.
True, the exhibited work on Cointemporary is not related to bitcoin, it's the website itself, a temporary online exhibition space of art for bitcoin. It is the first online only art gallery that uses BTC as a unit of account and as the ONLY payment method.
@_date: 2014-09-05 09:37:33
have you ordered this from somewhere? If so, from where?
@_date: 2014-07-07 22:13:36
Growing up in Graz my guess is, that this is an old granddad who noticed your new shop during his daily walks. Clueless about what Bitcoin is, he suddenly reads this article in the news and felt the need to share it with you and your customers. Probably - in an deeply honest and caring attempt - he's just trying to warn you.
@_date: 2014-07-09 18:41:34
And have I mentioned the free worldwide shipping?
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:26:33
Thanks, good idea. I'm a big fan of Wonder if he'd be up for it! As we are thinking of asking external curators, this one could be filed under: curated by reddit!
would that interest you?
Edit: Wrong username
@_date: 2014-07-22 23:05:19
I'm also quite excited about this!
@_date: 2014-04-24 09:19:59
Sorry, I don´t get it. English is also not my first language.
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:32:17
Browne’s practice offers a directness that reveals their own making. The artist's investigation into depth through a ‘flat’ medium (painting) was of particular interest for us – and how the presentation of an artwork on a screen (flat device) can work. There in turn lies a deeper window to look through, or perhaps not. Depth, two-dimensionality, and their back-and-forth dialogue.
@_date: 2014-04-24 09:21:21
That´s a very nice offer. But I guess it would get complicated for me taxwise...
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:22:34
It's like with BTC: the more you look into it, the more fascinating you'll find it. Give it a try, (wo)man, or else you'll sound just like one of these buttcoin trolls.
@_date: 2014-07-30 06:54:21
From my understanding it's color pigments and just like other colors used in paintings, drawings, etc. it is supposed to last for a long time if you follow some basic rules (no direct sunlight, extreme temperatures, no high humidity, etc.)
In case you are actually interested: if you're living outside of EU the VAT (10% TAX) will be deducted at checkout.

Here, you are [doing it again](
@_date: 2014-11-04 09:48:54
Yes, over the counter using the Bitpay Web Point of Sale.

It's aluminum.

I hope this association does not reflect on your upbringing.
@_date: 2014-11-12 09:12:22
Which one would you recommend instead?
@_date: 2014-07-30 05:42:09
And can you also explain the design? Why 14 LEDs? Why not in a straight line? Was that a solely functional decision?
@_date: 2014-07-30 05:08:45
okay. and?
@_date: 2014-07-22 23:36:29
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:54:37
Thanks, very helpful advice. In the meantime, BitPay has replied to my me. See my updated in the original post.
@_date: 2014-07-29 23:19:15
This one did not sell. The one before - we always only show one work at a time. Thanks for your support!
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:19:35
ITT: Bitcoiners presenting themselves in the best light.
Really, why so ignorant? You sound exactly like those who you criticize for not getting Bitcoin - just now you are the ones not getting it. Don't be so freaking philistine. Educate yourself.
@_date: 2014-06-26 21:53:15
It features articles about *Art under Capitalism*, one of them is called *21st Century Theory: The Age of Debt*.
The cover artist is [Dan Perjovschi]( He is known for his cartoons, drawings and writings and has been shown at the MoMA, the Venice Biennale and many other places.
In my understanding he criticizes the development of the art market, where art has just become another commodity or asset and draws a connection to bitcoin. As art, bitcoin has no clear intrinsic value and as the art market, bitcoin is unregulated. I would like to think, that he understands the potential of bitcoin and considers Bitcoin to be a conceptual art piece, that - like Jeff Koons works - are reflecting on and playing with the monetary status quo.
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:51:42
We are aware of this and taking BTC only is part of our concept. Our goal is to place the artist’s work in a broader global visual context free from the hegemonic monetary system in which contemporary art is embedded. Today, the quality of art is almost only evaluated with Dollars. Our website aims to be a playful way to circumvent this.
@_date: 2014-09-06 16:49:21
About 1 hour ago.
@_date: 2014-09-06 18:04:31
Hehe. Good luck!
@_date: 2014-08-12 21:05:27
Did you borrow this .gif from a buttcointer comment? Cause you're reaction to the artwork is similar to how they usually respond to bitcoin. Educate yourself about contemporary art, then criticize.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:46:09
When is the next meet up?
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:09:38
Yes sure! It's a website, where only one artwork, denominated in BTC is listed for a maximum timeframe of seven days. If the work is not sold after that period, a new work automatically comes up. If it sells, it will immediately be replaced with a new work.
@_date: 2014-07-30 00:56:08
Yeah, you're right. And the bitcoin network is only some lines of code and zeros and ones. Same difference.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:50:00
We are actually working on something like this. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:57:39
Again: the point is not if you can make it yourself or not. You seem to totally miss that.
@_date: 2014-04-28 20:38:20
BTC doesn't make the situation better or worse and the withdrawal right is not connected to the type of payment or currency. But if we offer the shipping of our product, we would theoretically be responsible for the back-shipping in the case of a withdrawal.
Our solution would be to offer a list of shipping companies that are working with us. They invoice the shipping separately. We are would not be responsible in this case and the shipping back would have to be covered by the purchaser. Our problem: we would like to work with a company that takes BTC.
@_date: 2014-09-05 12:41:58
Thanks, mate.
@_date: 2014-07-23 07:25:29
Thanks, very appreciated!
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:47:29
We encourage them to take BTC, but if they want we pay them in FIAT.

Thanks, Peter. Now, let´s find out if a marriage between contemporary and art is possible!
@_date: 2014-07-10 00:21:05
No. No magic eye.
@_date: 2014-10-20 21:48:47
I envy your talent.

Oh, boy.
@_date: 2014-04-25 07:54:22
I'm based in Europe. Due to the withdrawal right in the EU we are looking for a shipping company that could deal directly with our costumers. Preferably in BTC.
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:04:10
thanks for your input. the reverse logo was a long discussion but we wanted to emphasize on the exhibition space - all other pages are only subpages, not so important. I know about the "con" problem, but we want it to be read as "contemporary" which obviously means a whole different thing.
@_date: 2014-07-30 04:43:03
I hate to do this, because it really isn't appropriate and the least I want to do is to create a connection between the artwork and what I'm going to write now, but because it seems like some are really having hard times to grasp all of this, I try to come up with a simple example: last year I've talked to a guy who works as the Chief Design Officer for a huge lighting company (you know them, trust me). He explained to me, how they were approached by a big automobile company (you know them, trust me) to create a new headlight signature for their cars.
They ended up 'designing' a wave shaped LED stripe that looks [like this]( and has now become the standard headlight for this brand. But before it become a standard feature, people paid hundreds of dollars extra for 14 LED lights, that actually cost 3 USD.
Of course, people could buy LEDs and try to install them themselves, etc. But what you are paying for, is a team of designers that created a signature that everyone recognizes and that is worth more than 3 USD. And it was worth it, because I'm sure that if you've clicked the link you've already and  immediately recognized what car brand I'm talking about. Simply because auf 14 LEDs worth 3 USD.
@_date: 2014-08-12 21:06:24
What field are you working in?
@_date: 2015-07-15 14:24:21
Hell yes! I live around the corner, will def check it out!
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:22:41
We are proud to bring you the first edition of digital artworks (files) that are exhibited on [Cointemporary]( They can be purchased for bitcoin only and every work has an entry on the Blockchain. This has been made possible by [ascribe.io](
Here´s a [short clip of the process]( and an [outtake from a panel]( where it was first presented.
Play around, start collecting and have fun!
@_date: 2015-04-24 16:08:46
If you have some spare 0.12 BTC, buy a work and play around with a real work. After you bought the work, you can transfer it to someone as a present or try to resell later. ;-)
@_date: 2015-04-24 16:51:48
[This]( is where they bought it!
@_date: 2015-04-25 09:14:06
You're basically right. But the question is, what is more important: Having the file or being the owner. It's an ongoing discussion and there are many different positions.
The MAK actually held [a talk] ( about this issue
@_date: 2015-04-24 12:31:15
Cointemporary uses ascribe.io. The artist himself "signed" the work through Ascribe and consigned it to Cointemporary. [More info here.](
@_date: 2015-04-09 17:23:43
This is due to the capital L. I didn't change the lower-upper case! ;-)
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:52:33
They are.
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:51:41
But is it collectible?
