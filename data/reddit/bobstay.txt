If you were concerned, you could just look on the lightning network explorer to check. But in general, nodes will have more than one channel open - in order to be able to spend what they receive.


It's not a big deal if they close their other channels. You'd likely have more than one channel open yourself, and you'd just route the money another way.


No, you get your (unspent) money back from the channel if it's closed.


That's kinda the point of a network. If someone closes a channel, no big deal, it gets routed around another way, or a new channel gets opened. When you set up your lightning network wallet, just open a few channels to a few nodes, and forget about it. If one closes, it's not a disaster.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:35:12
Hardly surprising, given current fees are around 400sat/byte.

@_date: 2017-12-14 08:49:13
Well, not really. The coffee shop can't unilaterally take/freeze your money like a bank can, and you can close the channel at any time. If they refuse to agree to close it immediately, you just have to wait for the timeout, and you get all your unspent money back from the channel automatically.
Or just open a few more channels and route around them.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:52:26
No, because you can run your own LN node if you want to. I know I will be, if I can work it out.

The bitcoin is "stored" in the distributed blockchain, which is public, and has thousands of copies worldwide. Your wallet contains the cryptographic keys to allow you to spend it. So destroying the wallet doesn't destroy the bitcoin - it only destroys your ability to get to it.
The keys are derived from that 12/24-word seed, so as long as you have that, you can recreate the wallet on any software that supports the "HD" wallet standard.
So yes, if your phone is destroyed tomorrow, all you would have to do is put that 12/24 word seed into another compatible wallet app, and it will be as if nothing had ever happened. All your transactions and balances will be there again.
But keep the seed words very secret, because if someone finds them out, they can also recreate your wallet and steal the money.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:40:05


And bitcoin isn't?

Theoretically, but I'm guessing some rebalancing will be needed on a regular basis, which will involve closing and reopening channels?

Edited. Original said:


@_date: 2017-12-13 15:15:31


This isn't right. Once you have a channel open with the coffee shop, as long as the coffee shop has channels open with other nodes, you can spend the money at any connected node.

Well, as I understand it, GDAX is owned by Coinbase, so transfers Coinbase -&gt; GDAX are free. I've not used GDAX though, only Bitstamp. I believe Bitstamp has a slightly more solid reputation than GDAX. I think both will require you to go through a verification process involving sending scans of your ID. I had to do this for Bitstamp. So it's swings and roundabouts, and up to you :) No harm getting accounts on both, if you feel like it.
As for iOS wallets, I'm an android man, so not the best person to ask. From what I've heard, Breadwallet is the most popular, but Green supports SegWit, which means that fees sending from it should be 30-40% lower.

I think so - if you mean that another block can't be generated until all nodes have verified the previous one, then "before" is the right word in your sentence. English is confusing sometimes. Are you Spanish-speaking by any chance?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:36:42
No - but that's the cheapest (in fees) way of doing it.
You can choose to open one, or a hundred channels - but you'll have to pay a transaction fee for each one.
It's up to you.

Localbitcoins is the go-to place for people who can't buy on exchanges. It's entirely a platform for people to sell as individuals, though, like ebay, so you're trusting the person you buy from, not Localbitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:45:27
If you're sending as much as you can, then send it in one big lump, and you only pay the fee once. A $10 fee on a $500 transaction is much more acceptable than a $10 fee on a $50 transaction. The amount you send doesn't affect the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:46:29
I've been using Bitstamp since I started in 2013, and they've always been good for me. Never lost anything or had a bad experience with them.

If you have to use paypal, your best bet is localbitcoins.com - but be careful, and choose a seller with a good reputation, even if you have to pay a little more.
But the exchanges (Bitstamp supports SegWit) will be cheaper in the long run - you just have to get verified which takes time and sending your photo ID.

The 2 transactions are to open and close a payment channel. While that channel is open (and it can be open for months or years), you can make as many payments as you like, instantly, with very little fee. Until the channel runs out of funds, and then you have to open another one.

I meant if one was running a fixed lightning node, not for the purpose of buying coffee in coffee shops, but for the purpose of helping the network and in the process collecting routing fees. In that case, do the channels between "routing" nodes need to be funded, and if so, how much?

It will probably take you a while to get verified (i.e. an ID check) on most of the exchanges (Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc). So your best bet if you really want it **today** is LocalBitcoins.com - but check the reputation of the seller before you make a bank transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:13:28
Thank you for the clear explanation. So a decent routing node would:
a) Need to be in possession of a significant amount of bitcoin
b) Need to be on the ball, closing channels as they become depleted, and opening new funded ones (I assume this would be automated)
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:44:38

@_date: 2017-12-17 21:46:57
Yeah, you can look at the day's chart *at the end of the day* and say "well, I would have bought *there* and sold *there*", but hindsight is 20/20 and you can't know that this is "the top", and this is "the bottom" at the time, because you don't have a crystal ball.
If you want a lesson on why day trading is a bad idea, feel free to try it - with a small fraction of your investment. That's what I did, and quickly realised it's a fool's game when the market did the opposite of what I thought it would do.
In the end, there's a reason people tell you to hodl. It's going up so you'll gain anyway - trying to get more out of it is just risky and greedy.

Bitstamp? Based in the EU, accepts SEPA transfers.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:51:14


You won't need to do that. One channel opened to a node will allow you to route through that node to others with minimal extra fees.

You know reddit has a save function, right?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:23:54

The size of the fee doesn't depend on the size of the transaction. So to send $10 costs the same as to send $1,000,000 - about $14.

How about bitstamp? They support credit/debit card purchases from many countries now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:32:10
The difference between "low" and "high" is like 50 sat/byte, on a 400sat/byte fee. Doesn't save you much to go for a fee that'll take a few hours.
Meanwhile thousands of transactions under 100sat/byte are going to take weeks to clear, or never, if bitcoin popularity continues to surge.

@_date: 2017-12-13 16:22:14
Given that fees to move bitcoin to your wallet are ~$14 at the moment, it doesn't make much sense to withdraw until you have a decent amount in the exchange, or you'll lose most of your money to the fees. If I were you, I'd wait until you had at least $200 in the exchange before withdrawing. Even then, you'd be losing around 5-10% in fees.
So, I'd choose a reputable exchange (my preference is Bitstamp), and enable as much security as they offer (two-factor auth in particular), and then keep doing your buys until you get to a point where a $14 transfer fee isn't a huge proportion of your investment. Then pull it out into a wallet.
When you do pull it into the wallet, check [here]( to figure out a sensible fee to set, to make sure the transaction goes through in a sensible time. Don't be too stingy - you'll feel a lot worse watching that transaction sit in limbo wondering when it's going to arrive, than you will about the fee.
Also, some exchanges (Bitstamp &amp; GDAX iirc, possibly among others) have zero fees to transfer bitcoin out. In which case, you have no reason not to pull out your bitcoins as soon as you have them, as long as you have no plans to sell anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:04:07


No, two months worth of all your transactions to any shop, not just the coffee shop. It's a network, and it can route your payments *via* the node you open your channel with, to other shops/nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:02:04
No, it's ok, you're not an idiot - nobody could have known. And anyone who has bought bitcoin and held on to it, so far, has ended up in profit.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:51:18
I personally think it probably is a bubble of sorts, in that a lot of people are buying because it's popular and rising in price.
On the other hand, it's also a scarce resource with a finite supply, and will become scarcer as people lose coins, and as they become harder to mine - something which is not the case for most other currencies and/or assets.
How those two factors will interact will determine how the price changes. I'd expect a drop at some point, but  eventually, unless people lose interest entirely, it's bound to keep going up because of its finite nature.

SegWit is an improvement to bitcoin which was approved a long time ago by the nodes, but not all the client software or exchanges have got round to supporting it yet. If they do, it will help reduce fees by a significant margin, by fitting more transactions into a block.
