Where to begin with you?
How about [here]( and [here]( Notably:




The most popular implementation of bloom filtering SPV, BitcoinJ, has its limitations compared to Electrum's SSL authenticated SPV. Electrum by comparison clears up the fundamental issues with the Bitcoin network that BitcoinJ cannot, and Electrum in doing so gives people the ease of use they expect from every other web wallet or SPV wallet. And just to reiteratre, Electrum *is* SPV. It's been doing SPV since 2011. It pioneered the concept of 12 word seeds a superior wallet management mode concept which has been shamelessly copied by every major Bitcoin wallet since then.
To be frank, you're conflating bloom filtering with the concept of SPV itself. This is a very common misconception that I'm going to spend the time correcting here.
Electrum uses SSL to authenticate the SPV headers, which bloom filtering SPV clients fundamentally cannot do. Both approaches, are SPV. Electrum is equally as SPV as any BitcoinJ based wallet.
Also contrary to popular belief, bloom filtering SPV **involves remote servers**. Those servers are running `bitcoind` and you don't even know who is running them. There is simply no fanciful "P2P network" that your client can "reach into" undetected and for free in Bitcoin. But with bloom filters, since you don't know which servers you're connecting to, you also can't use SSL authentication denying you both security and privacy.
Still, most people say to heck with that, "there's no server". Incorrect.
What's to prevent that server your bloom filtering client connects to from keeping logs? Nothing. There is absolutely no privacy assurance whatsoever in that respect.
And what's to prevent the bloom filtering connection itself, broadcasted plain text no less, from being snooped on by anyone from your ISP, a hacker, to the NSA? Again, nothing at all.
In fact, there exist no privacy assurances whatsoever with bloom filters, aside from the bloom filter itself which BitcoinJ documentation clearly states are set to a privacy destroying default. You can only use Tor to get around this, but since bloom filters laughably don't even support SSL, the Tor connection for your bloom filters can be Sybil'd or MITM'd, as is what happened to Blockchain.info. This cannot lead to direct loss of funds, but it would be a stretch to call the bloom filtering model "secure" and even more of a stretch to call it private. In a nutshell, your aversion to "servers" in Bitcoin is severely misplaced, to put it mildly.
Bloom filters have no fail safe privacy mode. There is nothing but false positives, and again, the false positive rate by default in BitcoinJ is extremely performant and hence unprivate as can be, since the false positive rates are kept low to minimize resource usage. The model makes that fundamental tradeoff, there's no getting around it. You might as well be connecting directly to an Electrum server over SSL since you're getting zero privacy assurances in BitcoinJ in any case.
Furthermore, since you have to use Tor with both BitcoinJ and Electrum, why not just use SSL authenticated Tor connections with Electrum as is done in the Tails LiveCD. That's superior in every aspect to plain text bloom filters for security and privacy, period.
On top of that, since bloom filtering foregoes SSL, it also foregoes VerSum, which itself is the proof your thin client needs to ascertain whether the remote peers it's in communication with are in fact relaying trustworthy data. Without a previously arranged federated network of servers as in the Electrum model, such a security guarantee is absolutely impossible.
But I digress. Do you think SPV clients, of any kind, mean you don't have a wallet.dat? That's not true.
Do you think SPV means that you need to use encryption to store your wallet.dat? Again, that is untrue.
People just love to bash on Luke Jr and others who support keeping Bitcoin decentralized, and most of the time they have tons of fundamental misconceptions about Bitcoin. I see it over and over again. What do I get for pointing out their misconceptions with highly researched  data and proposals? Downvotes. They've been sold up the river, think the block size can infinitely scale and dammit they're angry because they've been lied to.
With this in mind, do you see why 80% of core developers are against a block size increase? It isn't because they don't like you, it's because they're better informed. They **built** the software BY HAND that you've come to rely upon and in some cases even *live by*. Heck, you should be thankful they're being as angelic as they are on Reddit, because **I assure you** the amount of confidently ignorant people getting others riled up for equally uninformed reasons will make an informed person crazy.

Yes, and OT would work with 1MB blocks, since it financially and socially incentivizes Bitcoin users to deposit spending money into multisig.
- **Social incentive**: if just *three* major marketplaces or exchanges integrated OT, this would lead Bitcoin users to ask non-OT services why they aren't trustless. This would likely cause a domino effect since non-trustless centralized businesses are perceived as too risky and greedy.
- **Financial incentive**: OT's PGP sigs act as a proxy to multisig BTC, with the benefit of receipt destruction providing ZeroCash privacy in combination with free &amp; instant payments.
It's a 2X incentive to use. But you're right, it needs serious user interface improvements and adoption. Hard to do that if the block size keeps getting raised before the market has a chance to react to new info. As for full nodes, OT servers can use pruning or Electrum to trustlessly monitor the chain for incoming multisig deposits.

If you had any experience at all running [Electrum server]( [Libbitcoin server]( or [block explorers]( you'd think differently. Blockchain API platforms like the above servers are *foundational* to any serious Bitcoin business that wishes to remain trustless.
And that entails *far more* than running a mere L1 full node.
You should really try running Electrum server. I've been saying it for days and I'm almost certain no one has had the "guts" to do it, which just speaks volumes to how lopsided and dilapidated the ecosystem is. Electrum server provides you with Electrum, Insight provides you with a block explorer. Lest we forget OpenBazaar, Dark Wallet and stealth payments all of which depend upon Libbitcoin server.
These servers see massive, popular usage on a daily basis, and if you make them too cost prohibitive, they're going to be even more unattainable than they already are. Take Electrum server for instance:


The cheapest dedicated box at OVH, which is one of the cheapest dedicated hosting companies, *starts* at [$96/mo](
`20 * $96 = $1920`
20MB advocates are blissfully unaware of this reality.
Do you know what would happen if the costs of Electrum server increased to nearly $2000 per month?! Who would run a server then? Answer: regulated intermediaries with million dollar budgets, if anyone.
And that's just for *20MB blocks*.
Yes, I fully understand 20MB is a cap and not guaranteed to happen, but the simple fact of the matter is a substantial proportion of active network service providers couldn't afford the effects of 20MB. 20MB today would effectively kill Electrum and Dark Wallet and OB and stealth payments.
And for what? At the cost of Electrum, you buy us no more than 140 transactions per second? Are you serious? It's still a paltry, lowly tps figure compared to VISA and we'd be hardly any better off than we were at 1MB even if you assume Electrum or OpenBazaar have zero market value.
Is it worth it? And why do you assume you have consensus? Oh, because you *voted*? Because "*straw polls*"? Filled out by people who have by and large absolutely zero stake in the direct effects of crazy huge bloated blocks no less.
Mike Hearn and Gavin never had consensus at 20. 20 isn't even an *option*.  *The drawing board itself* is an utter abomination and completely and entirely unacceptable with today's technology. To do 20 is to bet the entire Bitcoin network on Moore's Law, which is far from guaranteed.
Remember, $2000 per month is a quote for one, *cheap* dedicated hosting plan at 20MB. That's the price of a *single* server. You can easily imagine what that would do to the network's decentralization.
Let me be clear, if the block size were 20MB today, *Electrum would be no more*. OpenBazaar would have to completely rearchitect its backend component around bloom filtering which has a rather *untested* privacy and security model for Tor usage seeing as bloom filtering can't even support SSL. Stealth payments would be dead, since Libbitcoin server is the only production ready implementation of it and it has even greater resource requirements than Electrum server. Colored coin businesses would be strained as well since most startups can't afford $2000/mo just for renting a *single* server instance to parse L1. If just a **single** server for your Bitcoin business costs $2k-5k a month minimum, I have to ask what the difference is between Bitcoin and SWIFT.
In short, how about you run Electrum server or Libbitcoin server before you blissfully condone increasing my resource requirements by an order of magnitude?
And you don't have consensus. You never did!

- un-trusted off-chain third party transaction operator
Open Transactions [voting pools]( Do multisig, PGP signatures and cash receipt destruction sound untrustworthy to you?
- running multiple pieces of software, with extra storage and bandwidth
Clarify please? Cite specific examples, etc
- paying hugely expensive fees on par with shitty banking services
Open Transactions voting pools. Free and instant payments to anyone or any service, built on PGP.
- waiting days for a low fee transaction confirmation
See above.

Cost $X depending, it will be done only by the likes of BlockCypher, Coinbase, and BitPay. Or can you point me to a large company, that expends 5 months of time launching a single server component? Or a small startup that can afford renting dedicated EC2 servers right off the bat for hundreds per month? For Electrum server and Libbitcoin you need 100GB SSD, 10GB RAM at 1MB blocks, this is not trivial.
Blockchain APIs all rely on parsing additional non-standard data from bitcoind, additional parsing is typically a massive time sink above and beyond Bitcoin Core and extremely costly in terms of disk I/O.
The dismal performance characteristics of Electrum server are not unique to Electrum server and regardless they're necessary for popular services like Electrum, OB, DW, and stealth payments.
At a certain cost level $X, those servers are unattainable for large companies willing to go EC2, not even considering individuals. The question is how much is too much? Too much, and entrepreneurs won't have the means to run a trustless company, they will have to outsource critical API functions to BlockCypher, Coinbase, BitPay - proprietary intermediaries.

Again, I'm telling you to run free open source software to fact check, so ultimately it shouldn't matter who is saying it.
Why do you think Electrum SPV doesn't matter in a debate over scalability, anyway? Do you think BitcoinJ is the *silver bullet* for Bitcoin scalability?
Electrum belongs in this debate, at least as much as BitcoinJ does. I don't care if himself wants to hand wave away SPV in this debate. I'm going to continue informing the public about clear and present issues with it, and you can check the facts for yourself by running Electrum server.
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:13:36
And if your Electrum server shuts down improperly? You're forced to restart from *zero* the entire block import stage which entails long periods of high disk I/O and CPU intensive usage.
I am a horrid tight rope walker, and I'm telling you I don't want to walk on a tight rope ever again. The masses nevertheless *insist* that my tight rope be raised, at minimum, to a height 20X what it already is.
@_date: 2015-06-04 14:59:23
Apples to oranges.
If you're willing to accept VISA's fully centralized approach, you can trivially settle Bitcoin transactions on Coinbase's proprietary internal ledger. Open Transactions voting pools or the Lightning Network add shades of gray between Coinbase and blockchain spending.
Importantly, Bitcoin has a 21,000,000 count supply cap unlike the USD, which makes BTC the superior vehicle for long term savings. And unlike the USD, you can keep the bulk of your BTC savings in wallets only you control.
@_date: 2015-06-07 04:47:54
This approach suffers from the same fatal flaw as Namecoin does: alias spoofing or MITM of thin clients leads to total financial loss. IOW, if your SPV wallet performs a look up for  you cannot prove the result returned is accurate or honest. This means a hacker can insert his own Bitcoin address and you would be sending BTC directly to the hacker.
What are your thoughts on [VerSum]( It seems to be designed with Namecoin security in mind, and appears to be the only workaround to this threat.

Bitcoin turns into SWIFT when the cost of running [Electrum server]( exceeds fixed cost $X. Adoption be damned. I say this knowing not every company needs to run Electrum server, but to avoid becoming SWIFT, it *must* remain possible for companies to maintain trustless Bitcoin APIs without paying an intermediary like BlockCypher or Coinbase or BitPay to do that for them.


Since you're making an assertion that the future will be different from the present, it's on you to prove your hypothesis else your views could be considered whimsical.
But let's not get bogged down in these logical fallacies. This is very simple:
1. Do you like Electrum? Then run [Electrum server]( for yourself. You can't have your Electrum wallet without that server. Experience the costs first-hand.
2. Do you like OpenBazaar? DarkWallet? Stealth payments? Then simply run [libbitcoin-server]( OB, DW and stealth all depend on libbitcoin-server, and if you can't have the libbitcoin server, you can't have those nice things. Again, experience the costs directly for yourself.
It's that simple. Let's do away with theoretical debate and make suggestions based on present reality.
What you will very quickly see for yourself is the costs of running these basic Bitcoin services is *astoundingly high*.
If you can't handle this workload today, what makes you think you can handle it with larger blocks?


Now imagine that^ being twenty-fold more difficult. Can you imagine it taking 40 days - 20 weeks (five *months*) to launch an Electrum server?
Again, this is my real-world first-hand experience based objective measuring stick for how much it costs to launch a trustless Bitcoin business. At a certain fixed upstart cost $X, what's the difference between Bitcoin and SWIFT? You'd be forced to rely upon a middleman in both cases. Kiss your free and open access goodbye, SPV clients and adoption be damned.

OT prevents double-spends.


@_date: 2015-06-07 13:12:58
Open Transactions voting pools are the scaling protocol Bitcoin needs.
1. **Simplicity**: Code has been written. Easy to implement, and from a user standpoint, you just send BTC to a multisig address.
2. **Decentralization**: More decentralized than Lightning since running an OT server does not require having a blockchain or setting up complicated trust pathways.
3. **Privacy**: built-in receipt destruction for absolute maximum privacy like ZeroCash except it exists and doesn't have flawed init event

My experience is with running [Electrum server]( [Libbitcoin server]( on a modern multicore CPU with SSD. High end hardware that didn't come cheap.
For maximum robustness, admins should ideally be running Bitcoin services on physical machines in their direct control, but let's make it easy - you can run these servers anywhere on any hosting provider. I'm especially interested in seeing admins run it on "cheap hosting" as most of you seem to erroneously believe is possible. Well, prove that it's possible. It will cost you hardly anything at all. This is free open source software. Run it, why don't you? Verify what I'm saying is true.
Do you like Electrum? OpenBazaar? DarkWallet? Stealth payments? All of these technologies rely upon these servers.
Libbitcoin server takes, quite literally, *weeks* to fully sync as there's a *severe* disk IO burden to building an auxiliary index of address histories and stealth payments for thin client async lookups. Electrum server is only slightly better.
If you believe bloom filtering SPV makes this unnecessary, in short, you probably hold [common misconceptions about thin clients]( or you believe BitcoinJ is a silver bullet for scaling Bitcoin.
By advocating 20MB blocks, you are suggesting the client server SSL authenticated SPV model can be completely killed off, or at least centralized and only operable out of large datacenters by big budget enterprise.
Again, I insist you verify this statement for yourself by running free open source software on literally any hardware or hosting provider.
Run [Electrum server](
It's a very simple request.
Because most of you advocating for a block size increase simply lack first-hand experience with the costs of running real Bitcoin infrastructure like Electrum server.
After a few days of experimenting with actual Bitcoin infrastructure, you can get back to me with your informed opinion about why you think it's a good idea to make Electrum server and other SPV infrastructure services 100-2000% more difficult to maintain.
It matters because this is what people run full nodes for, as a means to an ends. Most aren't running nodes for the sake of it, but for the sake of their business, or in support of colored coins, Electrum, DarkWallet, and OpenBazaar. If you want to jeopardize all of these service providers, increasing the block size limit is a good way to do that. Again you can verify this statement for yourself by running [Electrum server]( or [Libbitcoin server]( Put up or shut up.
All I've heard so far from 20MB proponents is excuses for why they can't run this free open source software. Or excuses for why these servers don't matter (aka the "BitcoinJ is a silver bullet for scalability" crowd).
*Run it already*. If it's so "easy" to support bigger blocks, this software should be a cinch to run at 1MB blocks, surely.
I'm pointing you to free open source software and telling you to *run it*.
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:40:58
Oh my f.. conflict of interest? Do you think Open Transactions voting pools or the Lightning Network are somehow a conflict of interest? Importantly, do you think they would be "years away" for Steve Jobs? Necessity is the mother of invention.
And if you want to attain global adoption of BTC, 140 tps simply *isn't good enough*. We're all *totally screwed* anyway even if we play 'kick the can' in the short term without the real solutions like OT, LN and sidechains.
Bar none, the single most powerful way to bring those solutions to life is to allow copious amounts of pain and suffering to take place. Doing so gives solution providers a clear and present gateway to commanding massive attention in the marketplace. Desperate mass cryouts for solutions is the highest probability avenue to long term success of those solutions: just ask George Bush.

There are plenty of notable holdouts amongst this crowd, and you're placing far too much stock in them in general. Just off the top of my head, patio11 and the guy who made of Flask, but the list is essentially endless. We're still very early days.


1. Android and iOS are black box operating systems owned by PRISM/NSA companies. They are not scaling solutions, they are not secure, and most of all they are not private. It's laughable the number of startups touting "mobile" Bitcoin "security" in this space. It's nearly as bad as the numerous JS based web wallets.
2. I'm betting over 95% of desktop BTC hacks have been done to Windows users. The beauty of Bitcoin is it financially incentivizes you to learn secure computing practices aka Linux. If you can't be bothered with secure computing, then Coinbase or Circle are for you.
@_date: 2015-06-06 00:04:47
My experience is with running Electrum server, Libbitcoin server and Insight on a modern multicore SSD which *struggled* to keep up with the network past block 300,000.
I have reason to believe this is a common experience, and that many ops don't go "cheap" on hardware.
The servers perform shoddily and unreliably without 100GB+ SSD, 10GB RAM and modern multicore CPUs.
If these servers don't scale on top end hardware, what's going to replace it? How can it be optimized away? What should projects like OB use on the backend if not for a client-server architecture? Bloom filtering? Where's the SSL? VerSum which is the missing component of SPV or so I'm told isn't even *possible* without a server, and the VerSum function makes the servers even *beefier*.
And how about colored coins? Parsing the L1 chain is not optional for plenty of innovative Bitcoin services and it's a constant struggle to keep up with the network with top end hardware for all of these initiatives. Making it an order of magnitude more difficult kills Electrum, OB, DW, stealth payments, colored coins, if not entirely then at the very least it makes them hopelessly centralized akin to SWIFT where operation can only be afforded by big budget enterprise.

There's a *slight* difference between open source and proprietary software? Apparently this fact has gone over your head.
Just a *slight* difference there. I won't hold that ignorance against you though. Just kidding, I am holding it against you, and I made a mental note to save my breath in your future uninformed responses.




Google "Blockchain.info theft". You must be living under a rock.


Is that your excuse for running a PRISM/NSA owned, spyware filled operating system brimming with zero days? Just use Circle or Coinbase. Bitcoin really isn't for you.
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:53:21
This isn't meant to be about Electrum - see also [insight]( and other block explorers, in addition to colored coin servers, libbitcoin-server.
Full node is effectively L1.
Blockchain APIs L2- basically higher level parsers of L1.
But do you think it's good if all those L2 services are restricted to BlockCypher only? That would completely suck. New entrepreneurs locked out? That could be the reality.
This is why I recommend everyone run Electrum server or libbitcoin server, insight... The costs are surprisingly high at 1MB blocks. Making it 20X harder is just inconceivable to me.
As someone who actually runs them, too much of the discussion is solely focused on L1. Shocking that L2 servers receive no words in this debate. I must be one of the only admins pointing out this obvious shortcoming of increased block size.
Run any block explorer just to get a feel for the true resource requirements, they will be an unpleasant surprise *at 1MB blocks*, I guarantee you will learn something.


Maybe. Maybe you could pull off Electrum server on cheap VPS. But most of the 10,000 deep pruning operators are on dedicated boxes already, €100/mo and up. Not cheap not expensive. 20X that, and that's a problem. 200X and it's just plain fubar.
No business model in the cards for electrum-server, can't do it has to compete with bloom filtering, it has to be cost free.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:28:14
OT is like [GreenAddress.it]( which AFAICT uses Electrum to monitor the chain for incoming multisig deposits. You don't need the full chain with OT.
In fact, OT is almost exactly like GreenAddress.it, except the BTC you deposit into OT multisig is meant to remain unmoving. Instead of depositing and withdrawing on-chain as needed, OT issues you a PGP signature, which you then use in lieu of blockchain payments entirely. Instead of paying someone with raw BTC, you use the PGP signature as a proxy.
The primary benefits to PGP sig based payments:
1. **Simplicity**. PGP signatures act as a proxy for raw BTC in multisig. With a simple change to a centralized website's backend database, they can profit in BTC, without ever using the blockchain until they wish to withdraw raw BTC from the multisig cosigner pool.
2. **Zero blockchain footprint**. It's like sidechains, except without the need for a parallel blockchain. Scales equally as well as PGP signed emails.
3. **Instant, free payments**. You're transmitting a PGP signature over the wire in lieu of using the blockchain with its fees and 10 minute confirmation times.
4. **Perfect privacy &amp; fungibility**. The recipient of the PGP signature doesn't have to know where the BTC has previously been "spent". Destruction of receipts is possible depending on how the multisig cosigner pool wishes to configure itself.
The gist of OT:
- At any time, the PGP signature can be used to withdraw BTC held in multisig
- You don't need to use the blockchain to send BTC or earn BTC profits from a centralized service
- Centralized websites become trustworthy at scale since they can't steal money
It's a radically simple approach completely devoid of magic or soft forks or hard forks, and the code is already written.

Then do it. Prove to us server ops that we don't need decent hardware to run Electrum servers which directly contradicts our own first-hand experience.
