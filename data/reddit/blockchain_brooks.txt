Hmmm...what something “should be” and what the  “reality is” are two different things. You are arguing ethics but I am talking about the reality of the matter: a person putting money into an exchange is taking a RISK. That really isn’t hard to understand, or is it? I’m surprised to see that people can’t even understand that putting money in an exchange is a risk IN REALITY. 
I hope the guy gets his issue resolved.

I feel your anger. But you have to know that at this point crypto is a “high risk, high return” type investment. Easy to make money, but also high risk to lose. Important crypto investment principle: only put in what you are willing to lose—gracefully. Hope all the best.

Yes I understand that. And I really hope the guy gets his issue resolved. 
All I am saying in plain English is that the minute you deal with a crypto exchange you are taking a risk because you’ve trusted them to handle your money. The entire crypto world is unregulated at this point. So when you put large sums of money in an exchange, it is a risk because it’s unregulated. Any experienced crypto trader understands that. 
I hope the guy gets his issue solved.

Just saying that once you put your money in the world of crypto, its a risk—even as simple as putting your money into an exchange. In fact it is pretty well known how risky exchanges are. 
This is one of the reasons amply warning has been issued about dealing in the crypto world—at this point. I never said he couldn’t afford it, just made the point that what you put in has to be the amount that you are willing to lose gracefully. I’m not saying Coinbase is right, just pointing out the fact that when you step into the crypto world, RISK is the first thing meeting you at the door. 
I wish the guy all the best.
