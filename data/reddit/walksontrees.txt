I am very butt hurt over this. I am sorry if i came across as sassy. I dont care how much someone tries to explain it to me, this is simply not fair. In no situation should there be a tax of 55% when you simply take money from your front pocket and put it in your back pocket. I literally transferred my own money to myself. Yes its a limited resource, but where does that transaction fee go? Obama? Trump? Bitcoin welfare? Does it go towards building the bridge between standard currecy and crypto currency? Is it for building more bitcoins? What is it for?

Yes it did tell me the fee, but it honestly was presented to me like i had  no choice but to accept it.  I know i was dumb, but hey i guess if i couldnt learn the hard way by reading more about  the shit, its just easier to learn the harder way by paying way more than i had to. Thanks for being direct. 
Thats for everyone else on here too...thanks for the replies.

Hypothetical here: so if I have a lemonade  stand on a busy street and  I sell cups of lemonade for $0.50 and I only take bitcoin. I have a great day and sell 200 cups of lemonade and walk away with $100 in bitcoin. I go to the store the next morning to buy supplies for the next day, try to use bitcoin, but I can only spend $50 because I am paying with a wallet that has recieved 200 mini transactions? The other $50 is given  clerk at the store bevause he has to count my 400 nickles or whatever?
Still not very fair in my opinion

How much data could I have possibly used though? $56 worth? I would think a netflix show would use more data than transfering some text over the internet.

So I pay to use data? I made the transfer with my cell phone, which I pay $45/month for unlimited data. I cant see what amount of data I could have possibly used to be charged $57 to transfer a bunch of text over the internet. It still just does not make sense to me that I pay so much to transfer bitcoin.

I did give it away!
Yes i am ignorant to bitcoin. I am not blaming anyone. I am trying to understand it but it still does not make sense. I used a mobile  bitcoin wallet and no where on there did it give me a place to voluntarily decline a transaction fee. You dont be so mean you.

I did not see anywhere for me to devline a fee.
