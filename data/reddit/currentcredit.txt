You don't think the legalization of weed will help scale the industry? You really think anyone who is going to use weed already does and so there is no room for expansion? Come on...
And don't be naive, Bitcoin ran up partially due to demand, but mostly due to speculation based on peoples fear that they were missing out on getting rich. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 12:54:35
Yeah you could do that with dollars if you’re going to countries with favorable exchange rates, not paying for hotels, and eating the cheapest food you could possibly find.
Not sure how bitcoin is the only way this would be possible.

Can’t wait for the Paul family political legacy, and the inherent idiocy that comes along with it, to end. 
 With this type of simple minded analysis, it’s no wonder libertarians are a the laughing stock of the political world. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:05:16
So nothing about actual functioning libertarians societies then? Gee, I wonder why
@_date: 2018-09-27 20:22:01
I’m talking about the spelling and grammar. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:22:53
How is pointing out an obvious and very relevant point a strawman or a toddlers argument? If libertarianism is such a wonderful and pragmatic way to live, how is there not one example of it in practice. Failed or successful. This isn't a strawman at all, its just an argument that you don't want to address yourself because it dismantles your argument. 
We obviously have differing opinions here. One based on empirical evidence and one based on fairy tale delusions.
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:33:46
Lmao. Bitcoin is the future! All you need is an extra computer you’ve never connected to the internet to ensure the safety of your money! I can’t believe mass adoption hasn’t hit already!

Can also thank the libertarians for their complete lack of rational or realistic economic understanding. For their ability to play on people’s fear and paranoia while regurgitating buzz words and pseudo intellectual bs that people are quick to think sounds great without realizing how asinine it all really is.

Selling sparks selling, which sparks more selling, and more stop losses, and so on and so on. That's how you explain it. Pretty simple actually. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 13:32:08


This is how and why fraud occurs though. People are stupid enough to think they can get away with it.
Good use of the word retarded, though. I remember talking like that when I was 14 too.

Bitcoin fanboys quickly becoming the most insufferable group on the planet. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 00:21:55
Lol what!?!? I can literally use the dollar for every single expense I have. But I couldn’t pay my rent with bitcoin, couldn’t buy groceries or pay car insurance with bitcoin. Can’t use it at any gas stations near me or at any restaurants. And the list goes on and on. 
This may be a tall order, but don’t be an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:19:00
It's guys like this that make people laugh at the notion of bitcoin. There are just way too many pseudo intellectual fan boys trying to be influencers. It's not a good look. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:11:05
I feel like it’s gotten way worse

If you’ve ever used the word  hodl unironically, there is a 99% chance you’re a financial wreck. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:07:28
Absolutely incorrect statement. Do you think people who held Enron or Lehman stock and were being patient had their bets pay off? 
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:26:02
Sure, their policy is steeped in delusion and an overly simplistic understanding of how the world works. In fact, most of their policy is essentially a lack of policy - it's totally lazy. Unfortunately, on the surface people think deregulation, non-interventionism, absurdly low taxes are just want we need. That is until they realize that it doesn't actually work in real life and that social darwinism isn't a way to create a better world.  
Hmm...maybe that's why no countries have actually realized a libertarian society.
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:25:45
Sad thing is you don’t even realize how stupid/ignorant/uneducated/misinformed/delusional/paranoid/simple you sound. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:23:38
There are way too many people in the game who simply have bitcoin because they think they’ll get rich. And everyone who argues to hodl because the price has no where to go but up are idiots. If that’s the case no one in their right mind will use it as a currency, which I thought was the end game...a universal currency. 
Make up your minds on what you want it to be and maybe people will take you more seriously. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 13:33:08
This is wrong

lol, this paper is barely 6 pages, and two of them are an introduction and a description of what tether is. Not sure the same meticulous research went into writing this as did the Griffin paper. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:25:23
The point is saying patience “always” pays off is an idiotic statement. Whether the comparison is apples to oranges doesn’t matter. Why is it so hard for people in this sub to think critically. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 13:07:17
Yeah. There seems to be no middle ground for some of these people. It’s all bitcoin or nothing and it’s completely delusional. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:31:18
You’re still not getting it...at all

Meaningless comparisons are what this sub thrives on.

Currency inflation in Argentina is merely a symptom of a much larger systemic problem. A cryptocurrency accepted almost nowhere surely isn't the cure.

@_date: 2018-09-05 21:06:20
Irrelevant statistics and metrics are the lifeblood of this sub.

The delusion is strong with this one. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:16:07
When bitcoin pops to $18k at a historic pace, it totally makes sense and is justified. When bitcoin loses 15-20% the only explanation is manipulation. This sub is over run with delusional conspiracy theorists.

So War didn’t exist before the central banks? Gotcha

@_date: 2018-08-11 14:08:12
Math not your strong suit, is it?
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:20:33
Yeah because transferring hundreds of thousand or millions is what that majority of people need.
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:06:47
I would argue that none of the factors are taken into account. Their main source of economic or fiscal understanding is taken from memes and random twitter posts posted in this sub. It’s a collective delusion equaled only by the_d.

What about failure when people become disinterested, it doesn’t reach mass adoption, it doesn’t reach widespread use among merchants, better technology comes along, etc, etc? Think critically for just one second and remove yourself from the grand delusion of this sub. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 02:19:34

@_date: 2018-08-12 14:44:26

To be clear, the study was conducted by a single person. The “US Think Tank” simply published it. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:56:14
Yeah, they'll go from a devalued currency to one they can't actually use anywhere. Would be a great idea. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 20:11:37
Pretty stupid take. All those things, excluding myspace and maybe Nokia, are still very much in use. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 17:31:55
What are you, like 16 maybe 17? Probably walked by Zuccotti Park once and claimed you were an occupier. I would ask you to explain yourself, seeing as you are clearly so intelligent.

@_date: 2018-08-10 22:46:27
Total delusion. Approximately 7 billion people in the world using fiat. You’re going to have to do a lot more than have value stability and L2 tech maturity to have them all of a sudden think bitcoin is a superior currency.

The sad fact is there are vastly more people using Facebook than there are who understand the basics of bitcoin. Regardless of what Facebook develops and what other coins other big companies develop, this is not good news for bitcoin adoption.

I’m sure OP struggled with it too, but decided it was just too “profound” not to post. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 14:15:41
I like how you think because you’re a business owner you can speak for other businesses in saying they’re getting fed up with visa. Let me know when real consequential businesses start accepting it.

@_date: 2019-03-26 11:28:30
Yeah if he had a magic ball he could have predicted that bitcoin would have plummeted after hitting $20k and sold at its peak. But Tim’s a delusional whack job who probably thought it was going to keep going up without slowing. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 13:56:07
Yes, the s&amp;p goes up and down, great observation. But over the long term you’re going to come out ahead.

Yes, people who stand to gain significantly are of course going to push the six figure narrative.
@_date: 2019-03-04 13:59:08
The consumer isn't responsible for the visa fees, the merchant is. So as long as merchants continue to accept other forms of payment, there is no real incentive to use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 13:56:46
Thats pretty bond heavy if you’re young

They’re willing to have a “discussion.” And then will swiftly come to realize a fraction of a percent of their clientele would use bitcoin.

You’re naivety is stunning. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 17:50:56

You have to be fucking kidding me. OP cannot possibly be this clueless/ignorant/stupid. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 20:53:37
Yeah, the same guy who continued to cling to Theranos after it was proved to be a fraud. Totally reliable. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 03:22:52
I’ll use bitcoin when it’s actually a practical method of payment rather than a novelty

@_date: 2019-11-08 11:52:03
Wow. So simple!!
@_date: 2018-10-12 02:07:21
Exactly. People treat bitcoin like a cure all. Who the fuck will be buying bitcoin when they have no job, income, savings, etc. 
@_date: 2019-03-05 00:15:33
And which model is that considering Kroger hasn’t made any commitment to LN?
@_date: 2019-03-20 11:19:26
A guy who still believes a massive scam and a massive scammer are legit wearing a bitcoin tie for a documentary watched by millions is not good for bitcoin.

It took maybe two years for Facebook to have explosive user growth. Not even closely comparable to bitcoin.

You almost couldn’t think of a dumber more illogical tweet. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:58:58
Because they will now have easier access to hoarding mass amounts of crypto. You don't think they'll find ways to control the supply, manipulate the price, create exotic vehicles to profit from, or just plainly rip you off? The whole point of bitcoin is to free people from the banks. How exactly does that happen by giving them even more power in the space.
Why all of a sudden do people think banks are now here to help crypto? It's absolutely mind boggling. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:32:56
You're comment is so misinformed its laughable. 
What stock market problems has bitcoin thrived in? There hasn't been a legitimate problem since 2008. And when stocks took a hit yesterday, guess what followed, oh right bitcoin. 
Also, people who are smart and know how to make smart financial decisions aren't panicking and liquidating their equity positions after yesterday. So there is no need to put their money elsewhere. Also, have you heard about bonds...do you know how they work? 
You'd be doing yourself a huge favor if you did even an ounce of research before posting totally asinine comments. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:03:13

Ah yes, moral avenues of progress. Like trying to undercut or lift sanctions on Russia, a nation that brazenly murders dissidents on foreign soil, among a multitude of other human rights violations.

That or continue to live in your paranoid and delusional bubble.

If by working you mean it still exists I agree. But if you mean working as in actually useful, there is a long way to go. 
Transaction speeds and volume are still laughable when compared to actual established payment methods. An infinitesimal amount of retailers actually accept it, and those that do aren’t really those selling necessities or accepting it as payment for things like rent, utilities, etc. As far as a store of value. Well most people are going to start arguing that the last 1/2 weeks of stability show low volatility. Sure, but it’s ignorant to limit your timeframe to that small window. Expand that a year and it’s still unpredictable and volatile.

@_date: 2018-10-15 19:46:26
How is the banks involvement not completely antithetical though? Bitcoin is supposed to free people from banks and government. This just allows institutions to amass huge positions and either, manipulate the price, sell it to people for enormous profit (making them even more powerful), or hoard it. In no way does it get you closer to a world where bitcoin is the main currency.
How can bitcoin supporters preach sovereignty and in the same breath think that institutions with enormous resources getting involved makes any kind of sense. 
This rhetoric makes no sense at the most fundamental levels.

Yeah I got that from your uninformed comment 
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:05:55
Have you read the article? This isn't allowing "less technical people" to buy bitcoin. Its allowing hedge funds, family offices and large financial institutions buy bitcoin. 
Do you not think this potentially gives those institutions massive power over the crypto market by taking huge amounts of bitcoin out of "less technical peoples" hands?
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:21:45

Quantitative easing has a precedent. In 1932 the fed bought $1 billion worth of Treasury securities. 


Zero rates have a precedent. Japan had a zero interest rate policy in the 1990s.

I mean, there are way more efficient means of gaining interest on stored money than a bank account with a .05% interest rate. Hell, my savings account makes double that. 
I don't believe Tether has the liquidity they say they do, but if they did, they certainly wouldn't have it sitting in some checking account gaining no interest. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 13:20:27

Precedent : noun - an earlier event or action that is regarded as an example or guide to be considered in subsequent similar circumstances.
So of course the scale isn't the same, but that doesn't mean it is without precedent. 


Why are you cherry picking the US dollar here? It makes no sense to claim that monetary policy tied to the US dollar alone is manipulating bitcoin prices.

@_date: 2018-10-27 00:34:01
I wonder why after 10 years people don’t get bitcoin is a currency. 
Oh maybe because an incredibly small number of legitimate businesses except it. Or maybe because visa can process tens of thousands of payments a second whereas bitcoin can’t even process triple digits. Or maybe because you can’t pay for stuff that’s actually useful, like rent, utilities, car payments, tuition, gas, etc. 
Get your head out of your ass.

But yeah, in just a short 5 years it will replace fiat. You people need to get better spokespeople. This is why most people think bitcoins a scam or a joke.

You’re not helping your argument. You’re just admitting that it’s only a good store of wealth if you bought at the right time. Has it been a good store of wealth for those who bought at $19k? how about $12k? Okay, $8k? Surely it’s been a good store of wealth for those who got in at $5k though...right?

Timing the market is always the best financial advice and strategy. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:57:05
Just because it can't be "killed" doesn't mean it will ever gain mass adoption. 10 years in and it's practical use is still to be seen on any legitimate scale. 
The evangelists have incorrectly assumed that there is some majority of people out there who actually "want" or "need" bitcoin. I don't totally blame them as the echo chamber they have created has become deafening to outside reason. Nevertheless, if you're actually willing to pay attention and think critically, you will see now that bitcoins meteoric rise has cooled and reversed, taking most of that money to greener pastures. The people who had propped up the price to $19k are now onto the next get rich quick scheme.

Never said they’d audit him based on a reddit post. But if he made that much money, like he said, it’s very likely the exchange will be sending a 1099k to the IRS. Would be pretty obvious if he didn’t report those gains in that case and would require no subpoena of any business.

Ahhh this moronic infographic again. 
We have progressed so much since 1932, making this comparison almost completely irrelevant and misleading. Take this quote from Steven Pinker’s Enlightenment Now: “A dollar today, no matter how heroically adjusted for inflation, buys far more betterment of life than a dollar yesterday. It buys things that didn’t exist, like refrigeration, electricity, toilets, vaccinations, telephones, contraception, and air travel and it transforms things that do exist, such as a party line patched by a switchboard operator to a smartphone with unlimited talk time.”

Anger is a normal, healthy emotion. But it’s unhealthy when it flares up all the time or spirals out of control. Chronic, explosive anger has serious consequences for your relationships, your health, and your state of mind. The good news is that getting anger under control is easier than you think.
May I suggest [this]( website for some extra help

Who is paying these “shrills”. Hint: no one, it’s not some big conspiracy.

Does it get exhausting always playing the victim?
Judging by your comment history, which is made up primarily of the word “retard,” you have some serious issues (anger, delusion, hatred?). I hope you get the help you need. Cognitive behavioral therapy can do wonders my man.

lol what an immature and totally off base comment. You think only trust fund babies are able to “invest”. And you assume because I am able to invest I must be a trust fund baby as if those are mutually exclusive. The fact is you have no idea what my situation is. And you can invest or save with minimal risk. Don’t act like the markets are all some speculative investment. 
Grow up and stop blaming everyone else for your situation.

The stock market is down for the year, partially  because of his mind numbingly stupid tariffs. Which everyone told him were an awful idea. And his moronic tax cuts have increased the deficit to historic proportions. See, taxes are one way the government generates revenue to pay for things. When you cut them you make less money. And when you have less money, but have to pay for the same things, you create a deficit. It’s simple economics.  Again, it could have been avoided if he wasn’t surrounded by people almost as dumb as he is. 
By the way, the Brexit vote happened before Trump won the presidential election you simpleton. This could have been figured out by a simple google search. 
Take your head out of your ass and read something other than Fox News and infowars. Educate yourself to what’s actually going on and you’ll look like less of an idiot.

So what does it say about him that none of his predictions are remotely close.

If you liquidate your 401k early for bitcoin you are not a very intelligent individual.

Whatever you need to tell yourself to prevent you from jumping off a bridge.

So you’re not denying that you have some deep psychological issues?

This place is truly an endless source of entertainment. Except most of the people don’t realize we’re not laughing with them.

It’s almost as if people have different opinions about things.

Lmao. Yeah okay guy

The mistake was bitcoin evangelists ever thinking a majority of the world’s population would ever need or want bitcoin (or anything more than a very, very small minority). So when people flocked in because they saw how “easy” it was to make quick money, those same people saw it as validation. Now that’s over and it’s becoming more apparent bitcoin is a fringe novelty. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:44:48


Wtf are you talking about. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:44:21
Lol exactly. I’ve never seen a less coherent message/mission statement  than bitcoin. It’s laughable 
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:36:43
The greedy bankers. Duhhhh
@_date: 2018-12-01 23:05:25
Please tell me the context where that comment is acceptable. 
“So here you have Barack Obama going in and spending the money on embryonic stem cell research. ... Eugenics.”
Literally endless amounts of these.

“Al Gore's not going to be rounding up Jews and exterminating them. It is the same tactic, however. The goal is different. The goal is globalization.”

Still not denying it. 
May I suggest [these resources. ]( I think they will do you some good. 
Godspeed

What exactly has it disrupted? 
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:25:22
Maybe if you’re dumb enough to keep your money in a checking account gaining 0% interest having not invested it anywhere else. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:38:04
This tweet just makes bitcoin look like even more of a novelty? The purchases I’m not allowed to make??? Which are what? Oh right, I’ve never not been able to purchase something with cash or my credit card. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:43:54
Yup, all the world’s governments, banks, institutions will never see an overly complicated, expensive, slow, and volatile currency that’s accepted almost nowhere of practical use coming. 
I mean who ever wanted their money insured to begin with!? And I know I’d much rather wait a couple hours to have my transactions go through than have it done instantly while also accruing cash back or points I can use on future purchases. And when I lose my debit card I would prefer if all the money in my account was gone forever. That’s why I’m pumped at the prospect of losing my hard wallet one day! The future is now!
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:29:23
Sounds like you did something wrong.

"This president (Obama) I think has exposed himself over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture....I'm not saying he doesn't like white people, I'm saying he has a problem. This guy is, I believe, a racist.”
