Bitcoin cash is just an alt-coin. I'm looking forward to being able to move my actual bitcoins with Lower fees, and users of the current bitcoin protocol adopting new rules which are beneficial for the ecosystem as a whole. It would be a historical undertaking if we proved we can do it. Satoshi would be proud...I think.

Jeff Garzik, a prominent Bitcoin core developer (and friend) who was removed from the Bitcoin github is a main contributor of btc1 node implementation with the 2MB upgrade and Segwit. Regarding Lightning, I'd like my transaction to be only subject to the cryptoecomomic principles of the blockchain, not payment channels.  It's not hard to imagine many would prefer on-chain scaling as originally intended.

Wouldn't 2x more block space allow for 2x more transactions which could pay half of the current fee and still pay miners the same if not more in tx fees? Didn't Satoshi Nakamoto himself recommend raising the blocksize at a certain time and upgrading nodes beforehand as the scaling approach  for bitcoin? I'm sorry if i fail to see the issue here, but I've been using Bitcoin since 2013 and my transactions used to only cost about 10c. Now that blocks are organically full, I thought users (us) would benefit from more space for transactions. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but hold off on the hostility of possible. If is really against scaling this way, what approaches are this community taking to scale bitcoin on-chain transaction volume in the foreseeable future?

"Installing btc1 means the end of your bitcoins"
Hmm. Considering I'll be validating 2mb blocks next month on the bitcoin chain with majority hashpower, i find it unlikely my coins will be at risk. I'd be more concerned if I had to wait until until difficulty adjusts on the legacy chain to have regular confirmation time again. 
"Fucking scamming thief"
I'm not really sure when we started name calling, but if you feel this strengthens your argument..
Btc1 is v0.14.5. Check ur node
I've made no bets, I have no economic incentive for bitcoin scaling other than the Bitcoin I currently own becoming more fungible and the subsequent market confidence. I've waited for larger blocks ever since they started being consistently full around the beginning of this year. In my mind, this is bitcoin growing up. I don't mean to offend anyone by speaking my mind. Honestly,  this seems like a pretty hostile environment for a collaborative community comprised of people who all share an interest in an innovative technology.

This post is very ironic. You call me a liar and continue to spread disinformation. The current on-chain block size limit is 1MB. This limit has not been increased since it was imposed to prevent ddos flood. Please review your source code if you have any doubts regarding this. "Maxblocksize=1mb". I  think you're referring to the theoretical transaction limit which has been increased due to the removal of signatures from SegWit txs.

Theoretically, if over 80% of hashpower starts mining larger -invalid as per core- blocks, then the legacy 1MB capped chain will produce blocks 1/5 as quickly as the main chain. With less accrued work, and slower blocks, it becomes much more vulnerable to attack. This is important for anyone who is considering not moving to the upgraded protocol. Please use caution if you are going to not upgrade your core node to 0.14.5 (btc1) You will experience slower confirmation time and increased double spending risk after the fork.

If we accepted a block with twice as many transactions, everyone could pay just over half the current fee/kb, and our miners would be economically better off. That's like, math.... +BTC price would go way up because our network would resolve this silly debate already, leading to greater market confidence (and better fungibility of coins).

Max blocksize w/ 0% segwit usage is still 1MB. Do the math and see for yourself. It's all there, kiddo.
Assuming &gt;90% SegWit usage, theoretical size is about 3.7MB. But that's witness data (sigs) which are not included in the block. For example, SegWit txns can become ANYONECANSPEND if miners collude, effectively reversing the soft fork. I repeat. This data is not included in the blockchain. SegWit txs are not susceptible to the same cryptoeconomic guarantees of regular transactions. That's why regular transactions are still as expensive as before SegWit. That's why the traditional scaling method of increasing the blocksize is both inevitable and good for Bitcoin. The way you treat your fellow Bitcoin-loving redditor, however; is not. I'll leave you to figure this one out in due time, friend.

2x won't be featuring replay protection, I thought. If the legacy Bitcoin chain will foreseeable receive minority hashrate, core should immediately implement replay protection to ensure the integrity of the legacy chain. Probably an emergency difficulty adjustment mechanism as well,  right? If users are inadequately prepared for the fork,  unnecessary damage could result. I thought 2x had been planned since May. How long do you think an appropriate length is for a hard fork? 1 year? 8 months? When is core increasing block size? I remember having to hard fork upgrade within 5 hours when the buffer overflow bug was found and over 50M coins were generated in one transaction. But those were simpler times, I guess.

When I say 2MB, I'm referring to the block size, which will be increased to 2MB. There really isn't any particular political slant.
