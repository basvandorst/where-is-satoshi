We *do* know Satoshi has all of those coins. They have remained (largely) unspent; it's right in the blockchain for you to confirm @ [block explorer]( or somewhere else. The only way *he* doesn't have them is if his private keys are in the possession of another person, but it still remains beyond question that his account has those bitcoins.

Like I said, we can be 100% sure that his account has billions of $s in bitcoins. Those scenarios only make it very slightly less than 100% that he has them *himself* but they are all unlikely:
1) I refuse to believe that it's a possibility that Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin, lost his own coins.
2) We *do know* for a fact that he had access to that account and therefore couldn't have been a "random" address because he sent test transactions from it early on, which meant he had the private keys (again you can look it up in the public blockchain). 
The only one that I think is remotely likely is that he died. Who knows, maybe he then left his private key to Craig Smith in his will (joke).

Agree to disagree on the first point.
As for the second, we see that the account that mined the first block and engaged in said test transactions is the same account that continued to mine countless blocks and to this day holds the billions in USD of BTC, so we know for a fact that he didn't switch to sending to random accounts (at least not right away); but if he did eventually, then he has *more* than what we think he has.
edit: Billions in USD of BTC not billions in BTC

I'm worried that this will give the incentive to perform a 51% attack that was not originally there as Satoshi wrote explained the white paper

I think the number sits above a hundred thousand BTC but I forget. Definitely not millions of BTC. Billions in terms of current USD value though.
