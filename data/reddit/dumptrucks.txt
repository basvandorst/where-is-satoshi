Neat.  It would cool to build an entirely self-contained miner / full node with, say, a Wind mobile data link.  If the carrier accepted bitcoin you could program auto-payments.  Just put it on a roof and let it do its thing.  It could be monitored remotely via web console or ping test.

Yes.  I've actually seen this many times and have myself listed items at a discount for buyers who use bitcoin.  Though, I'm probably not a good data point because I have a vested interest in bitcoin's success.


People are already doing this and pay conversion fees.  Deflation is a big part of the speculation surrounding bitcoin as we all know (halving).
Bitcoin savvy consumers will (and do) buy more bitcoin after making a purchase in an attempt to minimize the loss if price goes up,  but there is still a cost to purchasing more (transaction fees, time).

Neat project.  Once the panel and other equipment are paid off, you’re essentially powering the miner for free. And as newer more efficient miners become available in the future, you can swap them in place of your old one.  Of course the lifespan of the battery and the other hardware will be factor in terms of ROI.

@_date: 2015-12-18 01:37:27
I look at it this way; the deflationary nature of bitcoin is (or should be) considered by both spending and receiving parties when transacting.  If you think btc is going up in value due to deflation, perhaps a lower price point will be negotiated (or arrived at by market forces).
Ie. People will still buy stuff, they may just want to pay less knowing that the price will go up, and retailers may consider selling their product for less for the same reason.
I'd be curious to get feedback on this thought from someone who's studied Economics.
@_date: 2015-12-12 03:08:34
Nice summary of the sp20!  You may have just convinced me to keep it :)
Mine keeps my apartment warm here in the Canadian winter, and I just vent the heat outside in the summer.
Worth noting that the thing is quite loud.  It is possible to find a sweet spot though... like you mentioned, around 1.3TH... which let's me set the fan at 20% at room temperature and still keep the chips in the green.
Very flexible and basically out-of-the box mining solution. 
Even when the thing becomes obsolete for mining I might be able to find an interesting use for the controller board and the asic chips.
Might be worth hanging on to.

X11 definitely runs on GPU.  I'm pretty sure scrypt is an entirely different algorithm.  
You can sell hash power and get paid in bitcoin for mining a number of algo's.  Or just convert your mined alts on shapeshift or an exchange.
Cryptos seem to be becoming more and more liquid and convertible.
I remember Andreas making a point that it's a good thing bitcoin mining moved away from personal computers because otherwise malware and botnets would be incentivized.  It suspect altcoins are what's making this feasible again.

The author talks about why the price will go up in terms of supply/demand but doesn't mention that there are a few people who own most of the existing bitcoin.  These 'whales' dictate the supply as much (or more) than mining currently does.  
I believe the whales gradually selling off their coins are responsible for the downward pressure we've been seeing for over a year.  No one knows how long that will continue.

Just to add some perspective on this... 1Th of sha256 hashing currently nets about $1.50 worth of btc per day, or $45/month  (power costs not subtracted).  
Current chips generate a lot of heat at those rates, and typically require loud fans.  Sticking asics in cable boxes would be interesting, but currently impractical... unless you're just tipping for content rather than paying for the full service.
Maybe when bitcoin is worth substantially more this could become viable.
Edit:  it's unfortunate that btc mining became so centralized before ideas like this took off.  The combined power of one tiny asic toaster in every home would've made large mining ops non-starters.  Perhaps 'Toaster Coin' will end up being the dominant and most decentralized currency running a different algo.

I haven't had a single issue either.  In fact, yesterday I ran some tests during spamming to see how long it would take to get a confirmation when tx fees were a) slightly below the current average and b) slightly above the current average.  Using  showed the current average of just under 5 cents per transaction.
* Transactions sent with 3c fee were confirmed in 7 blocks (just over an hour)
* Transactions sent with 6c fee were confirmed in 1 block
I think the moral of the story is that people need to be aware of current tx fees, and more importantly, **wallets need to start implementing dynamic fees based on current market rates.**
@_date: 2016-01-09 06:50:55
It's like they're begging us to use Uber.
@_date: 2016-03-18 02:22:48
I didn’t support a fee market either until I spent A LOT of time trying to understand this whole debate.  I was initially for bigger blocks too.   Here are a few reasons I changed my mind:
*  There needs to be a cost to a) flood the network, and b) write to the blockchain, otherwise spam **attacks** (which is what they are) are trivially inexpensive.  We should expect that Bitcoin will be constantly under attack.  It’s in the wild of the internet, not behind some firewall or proxy like most financial systems.
*  Increasing blocksize alone does not remove the spam attack vector. What it *does do* is make it more expensive to run a full node. Which means fewer people will run nodes... Which means centralization.
* Transaction fees will gradually become more important as the block reward diminishes over time.  Eventually, fees will be the primary incentive for miners, and we need to keep miners incentivized to prevent 51% attacks.
*  When new users are introduced to Bitcoin, they’ll be familiarized with the concept of dynamic fees ‘off the bat’.  It's like surge pricing with Uber except you can still pay the normal rate... it'll just take a bit longer for your ride to show up.
The Core devs are thinking long-term and they realize that Bitcoin’s greatest strength is the fact that it is [to some degree] decentralized.  It’s just an unfortunate **fact** that putting every transaction on-chain just does not scale well if decentralization is important.
A fee market helps keep Bitcoin robust and IMO dynamic fees should be implemented into every wallet.

In this scenario (ie, bandwidth cap of ~300Gb/month), couldn't you just reduce the amount of time the node is running?  Maybe stop it you need the bandwidth or low latency.
Would be nice if this could be automated to, say, run 50% of the time and only when system idle.
This way you'd still be contributing but not maxing out your connection.

I genuinely just found it interesting that 10 years ago the current blockchain would have filled a typical hdd.  Now it uses less than 1% of a modern drive's capacity.  Moore's "law" and all.

Is that so?  Because I made it pretty clear that I'm interested in Bitcoin for the technical aspect and said nothing about being financially invested.  But keep on making weird assumptions, assclown.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:43:29
What irks me about these shit talkers (especially in a tech savvy forum like Ars) is the fact that it's undeniable that Bitcoin has accomplished something new and fascinating from a technical standpoint. Bitcoin is just really.fucking.interesting in my opinion, regardless of whether I believe it will 'change the world' or not.
It comes down to this: It's easier for people to dismiss something as complex as Bitcoin than try to understand it, and even in a forum like Ars, I guarantee most people don't really understand how BTC works despite the generally higher level of technical aptitude than say in a forum like facebook or [most of] reddit.
I'd go as far to say that people who are tech savvy but haven't taken the time learn about bitcoin are *more likely* to be dismissive. It's almost as if they're hedging their bets by reasoning, "I can't know everything about all technology, so I might as well bash the one thing I don't comprehend... so ya, it's dumb nerd money that died already"

Why does any currency have value?  Fundamentally because people are willing to accept it as payment for goods and services.
You could measure the 'price' of the USD in loaves of bread if you wanted to (Ie without comparing it to another currency) You could do the same for bitcoin.
Ex. How many dollars is someone willing to accept for their loaf of bread, and how many dollars are you willing to pay for that loaf of bread?  What is agreed upon determines the price in that market.  This is free market economics at its *most* basic.
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:23:04

If you look at social media there are applications that provide very similar services, yet both (or multiple) can be successful.  Some communities adopt one, others adopt the other.  I could be wrong (and I'm OK with that.  It's an opportunity to learn something), but I don't think it's unreasonable to think that cryptocurrencies are different in this sense.
Perhaps on longer time scales there can only be one dominant currency due to market pressures, but I'm just not so sure about that.

I’m generally a very skeptical person.  It’s a necessary quality in a world full of bullshit.  But in this case I’m leaning toward yes, there are likely people attempting to spread FUD and divide the community.  
Off the top of my head I could name four groups who would be happy if bitcoin died, or at least stayed small/crippled.  To list a few: altcoiners, buttcoiners, and yes, banks and government agencies.
Consider the following:
1.	By design, Bitcoin has no attackable center.  Social engineering is one of the few attack vectors.
2.	In a security agency's eyes, Bitcoin fuels DNM’s, and we already know the lengths they’ve gone to to take those down.  Why wouldn’t they attempt to get to the ‘root’ of the problem (as they likely see it)?
3.	If Bitcoin continues to grow, it undeniably will undermine government control (taxes) and financial institutions.  Historically, governments have gone to great lengths to protect their economic interests.  Why not nip this in the bud while it’s small and already internally divided?
As someone who’s been reading this sub for years, there’s been a noticeable change around here.  It’s bizarre reading most of these threads lately. It’s almost as if the community’s developed acute onset schizophrenia.
In some cases it would seem paranoia is warranted.

If you proceed carefully it may be possible to recover your files without paying these a$$holes 
Ransomware makes encrypted COPIES of your files and then deletes your unencrypted ones.  But when files are deleted from a filesystem, only the 'pointers' to the files are removed.  The bits that made up your files still exist until those regions of your drive are rewritten with new data.
You can try the following steps as a guidline to recover your files:
1.  Turn off the system (hopefully this was done when initially affected) and remove the affected drive
2.  Connect the drive to a new system (DO NOT execute any code from the newly attached drive)
     (Depending on the type of drive you can use a SATA to USB connector, or just install it as a normal SATA drive)
3.  Use a data recovery tool like Recuva (for example if on Windows)
4.  Save your recovered files to the new system
5.  Format the affected drive
Hope this helps.  Whatever happens, back up your data in the future!
Sorry if formatting is shit.  Typed this on mobile.

Right.  I was thinking using more than one stamp could work.  This may even add a layer of security for private keys because the stamps could be stored in separate locations.
Of course, if you're creating a physical representation of someone's private keys they would be putting trust in you.  BIP38 might solve this,  at least partially.

I called TD and the rep said they're phasing out the type of card that supports this, or at least not giving out new ones.  He said I could try asking for one at my branch but that they may not give it to me.
Apparently if your card number starts with '1305'  you can still use the service.  Visa debit cards starting with '4724' do not support it.
Any thoughts on how I can still use your site, or if you have plans to implement other payment options?

Excellent info.  Thanks!

The malicious executable is already floating around all over the net, i suspect the 'hackers' would have to redeploy it with new keys.
@_date: 2015-09-09 05:08:30
Cool idea!
@_date: 2015-09-03 04:22:11
Well this thread was depressing.  Reeks of ulterior motive, mind you, so I'm taking it with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2015-09-09 05:07:39
Thanks for the heads up.  I'll fire up a couple extra nodes to do my part.

Up until recently he was using Square but now has a debit/credit machine.
The idea is to put a Bitcoin "logo" in the window and by the cash along with other accepted payment types.
I'll look into the other payment processors you mentioned.
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:24:55
This looks really cool.  Thanks for sharing.

Looking forward to reopening my account!

I couldn't figure out what this does based on the site (might be because mobile).
What is this?
@_date: 2015-04-29 02:32:54
Agreed.  If everyone needed to understand SMTP and TCP/IP to send an email it probably wouldn't have gone mainstream either.
@_date: 2015-09-23 04:41:04
Too bad there aren't any ISPs that accept Bitcoin... If there were, you could put a solar panel on this thing and it would be a self-sustaining node.
@_date: 2015-09-21 02:20:08
This is awesome.
@_date: 2015-09-17 02:37:57
I don't think you know how sarcasm works.
@_date: 2015-04-09 23:23:58
Good to know.  Although keep in mind that many people don't have static IP's so these are likely not all unique seeders.  Could be as low as 50% of that number... Still much better than 6.5K
@_date: 2015-09-06 05:54:15
This made me chuckle.

They have a vested interest in the success of Bitcoin.  That's why I run a node (I'm a miner).
@_date: 2015-09-07 17:03:03
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:21:33
Not sure.  You could put anything in those fields though since there is no validation with a third party :)

I suspect if the number of nodes became a problem, those with high stake in Bitcoins success may try to incentivize people to run full nodes.

For paper wallets?  Asking because I did the same thing recently.   Pretty much the only use I have for a printer at this point.

The thumbnail is Bitcoin Decentral Toronto.  Which is interesting because CNBC is an American company.
@_date: 2015-11-06 04:21:38
Coinbase is available in Canada now.  Register with them, sell your bitcoin, then deposit your CAD to your bank account.  It will take a few days to verify your account but this is probably the easiest approach.
Good luck fellow canuck.
@_date: 2015-11-10 03:16:03
It's so you can get a refund if there are issues.  Not that complicated.  Enter fake info if you're so inclined.

You forgot the /s ?

In that case the market effect is not felt until the alarm clock owner re-buys.

"The appeal for me with bitcoin and MMA is it’s an international sport. A lot of guys have problems with getting paid and the payment processing that goes on. You fight in Brazil or somewhere else, and it takes a few weeks before you get your check. It’s not always easy for a lot of fighters."
@_date: 2015-10-11 12:41:40
I said relatively stable.  As in compared to bitcoin's price over the last several years :)

Not impossible.  Highly improbable.

From what I've read bitaddress is legit.  You can load the page offline to generate keys.

This is going to get expensive...
@_date: 2015-11-10 04:56:07
So change it to USD in your profile if it's an option.  I live in Canada and had the option to pay in btc at checkout.

I'm in Canada and it worked for me.  Also, I don't trust G2A.

"relatively stable".  You're just being poor at reading.

80% of BTC transactions are in China.  They probably don't care about the $300 barrier.

Burning coins has a deflationary effect.  It's effectively decreasing the money supply.  I don't think this would be measurable though, unless the alarm clock owner hit snooze often, and as a result had to buy bitcoin more frequently thereby increasing demand.

I see your point but considering the vast majority of the population still has not heard of, or bare minimum, does not understand Bitcoin, I think any new adoption is a positive thing.
My post was as much about the ease with which I was able to make the transaction (vs CC) as it was about just making my first transaction.
@_date: 2013-04-29 22:16:02
It makes sense...  I think I did click the small QR icon next to the address text box.
They should add a note somewhere that by clicking that icon the app will try to use your camera.
I can see this being quite disconcerting considering one of the reasons people use the site for privacy/anonymity.
@_date: 2013-04-29 22:09:51
Thanks.  Good to know...  
So you don't have to select an option to 'Scan QR Code' before it tries to use your camera?  Seems kind of sketchy.
@_date: 2013-05-02 03:57:18

It's possible I guess.
@_date: 2013-07-06 23:55:17
