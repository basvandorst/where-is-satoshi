No need, you can't stop cryptocurrency anyway.

Is there a law on returns? What about a 14 day max? And you could have return policies that are pegged to USD, so you will get bitcoins returned worth the amount the bitcoins @ coinbase or something the day of purchase.

You don't need a computer for paper wallet and brain wallet. Well technically - to create the keys...
But you do have access to a computer when using blockchain, so... I think online wallets are insecure because of the fact that you are typing your passwords etc through a browser... God knows what addins etc that listens to what you do.
At least enable 2 factor auth if you choose an online wallet. I love Blockchain!

I think it's better to just say "money" / "currency" though. Fiat is exclusively government issued. There is no law telling what the value of what crypto currency is.
If a country implement it's own crypto currency, and says what the value should be, THEN it is fiat.

Regulations require you to upload the passport... Otherwise customers wouldn't have done it...
And protection of property against theft is NOT a regulation.

Is there something that makes you unhappy about it? What is the motivation for getting the blockchain? maybe you should have written that!
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:40:37
You are at risk. You are in fact typing through a browser in an operating system that is online. Someone might monitor your keypresses. You never know...
And what if you get a stroke, and forget the password?
When you put it in cold storage, you write down your private keys and / or passphrase. In Electrum you write down the 12 word seed that is for all your addresses. You of course do this on a computer that is offline, and will never be online again (i.e. a live CD).

Try the client electrum! 
This client does not download the blockchain, but contact Electrum servers that has it.
Oops, saw that you mentioned electrum. Why do you want to have the blockchain? Doing some development or something?
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:01:17
Good! And then you can just relax and be lazy afterwards :-) 
@_date: 2014-03-13 12:15:34
Same here.
@_date: 2014-03-13 13:00:37
The only thing an evil electrum server would do is to not send your transaction through, and give you the wrong balances. But that would require that one of the approved servers there would get hijacked (if it's even possible to modify a server like that).
If you sign transactions on an online computer, could be screwed left and right regardless of what client you might use!

You are not alone in losing that much BTC. There are people that lost more and 100% of their fortunes. And besides, you just get back up, start over! I know it's hard.
Your kid will be MUCH worse off if you end your life. Don't do it. Your kid needs you, and loves you... 
And bitcoin has NOT reached the top yet! And it is not 100% sure that the coins are lost.

I am not so sure of this. Not too long ago, Cyprus robbed all people who had more than €100,000 ...

No bitcoins do NOT have high transaction costs in itself. When people talk about transaction costs, they talk about transaction within the same currency, and the cost of getting it from A to B. Of course there are costs related to exchanging fiat money for bitcoin...
Also Bitcoin's deflationary effect won't go on forever. I mean what else do people expect when more people go into a finite number currency? So it is intellectually dishonest to criticize it for that.

Not sure what's best on Windows to be honest, I used to use mIRC back in the days with "peace &amp; protection" script! But that's over 10 years ago...
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:17:35
True, I expect that, or worse. Governments around the world are far from laissez-faire! And bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be a real threat to them, since they can't use their currency to control the economy.
They will lose their most valuable tool: Inflation / interest rate.
But today there is a competition between countries to attract investors, so I have some faith in the economical free zones, Singapore and Hong Kong. Also initiatives are started to create a completely autonomous state:  Blog is not updated in a while, but the project IS active
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:59:38
Yeah man! Well, the thing is to get bitcoin into a closed economy where you can live your daily life without using government fiat money. But bitcoin is in it's infancy, but already now it starts to show signs that you can achieve that. Like hot dog stands taking bitcoin :) And then, the hot dog supplier takes bitcoin, and then the slaughterhouse and bakery, and then ultimately - the farmer.

@_date: 2014-03-10 12:30:21
Yes, I understand your thinking here!
But even the volatility as it is now, does not stop many people from using it right now, and it constantly increases. 21 million coins divided by a growing number of people is doomed to be deflationary in the start.
But what is perfect from it's infancy? :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:41:36
What on earth are you talking about??? Bitcoins are not created out of any debt. They are mined.
I does not need intrinsic value to not be fiat money. Fiat money is what a central authority, mostly government tells what it's worth.
Bitcoins has value, because the system it's in, is valued by people, and the scarcity aspect of course, and it's backed by CPU power.  Even intrinsic is value is valued by the market (people).
You can even say that Bitcoin has some intrinsic because of the usefulness of the blockchain, and the function of that ledger. A bitcoin holds a history of work spent in the blockchain as well, and that is a value, too.

It's the classic conspiracy theory that jews control the economy. Don't listen to it, it's bullshit.
It's no conspiracy that jews are over represented among smart people, it's just fact. But some people don't like that and spread jew hatred dressed as conspiracies.

Depends if you mean Laissez-faire capitalism OR anarchocapitalism. 
Laissez-faire capitalism includes the protection of property rights by the state. Anarchy does not. *I refer to laizzes faire when I argue*, so maybe this is where the misunderstanding lies! The seemingly small difference is really a huge one.
So things like swindle, theft and murder is completely compatible and included with a free market in a laissez-faire capitalist system. Because it's only protection against violence / coercion, not regulating peaceful behaviour. And privacy is also protected, because it goes under protection against the individual (your body) and property (what your body creates).
Anarchy on the other hand, has no state, no equal laws etc. So people that are anarchists are not welcoming any state's influence :)
Hope that answers your question!

Short answer: No. Bitcoin needs to be freeee (as in operate freely) in order to have a correct value.

You don't know, that's the problem. Printers are propietary, and they can have a history of documents stored forever. Safest bet is to completely demolish the printer if you get rid of it, and let NOBODY steal it.

Furthermore, I think it's better to ask this kind of question in bitcointalk and / or in  on freenode.
The topic is *huge* :)
There should be a developer's guide and strategies for safely working with bitcoins on an automated server system... A peer-reviewed guide. Community needs this badly, as services pop up and get hacked regularily!

Just be REALLY careful what OS and browser you use if you use bitaddress. When you type through a browser something might pick it up.
I'd either settle with Armory (I want to try Electrum as well), or download bitaddress.org to an USB stick and transfer that page to an offline linux machine, and then generate adresses.
It is not a good idea to trust generated keys through a browser that is online, and on a non-linux / openbsd system.
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:31:53
Bitcoins is more real than fiat money, because there is no central power to suddenly inflate it wildly. Fiat money is not real money.
That being said, you can get convicted for scamming people, no matter what you are selling. I guess you don't view any financial instruments as real assets then?
@_date: 2014-03-12 21:13:22
