Good point. You have to rely on XAPOs storage policies of private keys. It's always better to bein control of your private keys.
I would wonder if they keep the private keys in a paper format in their vaults along w their cold storage?

My guess is there's lots of people out there that just wanna buy into an index and forget it and let others manage.

While I do not use Coinbase, I've read this time and time again. Even on their subreddit they have loads of hostile link posts demanding service. With all the money they are making they should invest in a top notch support center.
Does Coinbase not support anyone outside the USA? If so how the hell can they allow people to sign up outside the USA if Coinbase are only supporting US based individuals. Crazy

Interesting. I'm looking forward to seeing what, and when, the CBs start seriously looking at how to "live" side by side w cryptos....until we don't need banks anymore ��

Entirely possible, but it's gonna be a long time before all dollars leave the conomy..If ever. I think that at some point nations will realize that they are helping the cryptocurrency space by printing more paper.
