Personally I will be buying all the way down. I feel like it will bounce back. Even if it takes 30 years, BTC could be worth a fortune.

The best way to lose everything is to buy bcash (otherwise known by its ticker as BCH).
If you stay away from that you're pretty much good.
On a serious note, I think all altcoins are a good way to lose money personally.

Since you're worried that's a very bad sign. The act of buying this should have been entirely emotionless.
Of course Bitcoin will go down further but in the end (it may take 30 years) your .8 btc will be worth a fortune.
From this point on I would look at your .8 btc as if it's not yours anymore.
Don't be tempted to sell it, especially if the floor falls out of BTC and it gets down to $4k.
Either buy more or hold on to what you have.
Or spend it maybe, (but make sure you replace it.) After all it is a currency.

Fyi, McAfee is a total piece of shit.
It enables a custom firewall that you can't turn off in windows

Lol, just keep the name and DP in the sauce.

Damn, really? I would never dream of trying to time the market.
Personally that sounds so stressful and it's definitely not for everyone.
Either way, I hope it works out for you.

Wait, what is this shit. McAfee doesn't even take Bitcoin as payment

I dunno, I found this post to be funny so I accept it to me it's just a meme. Also the price of Bitcoin today doesn't even matter, we know it's only going to go up in time.
I mean no offence to you and I appreciate your warning but your comment reminds me of what does any time someone posts anything anti-bcash (aka Bitchcoin, aka piece-of-fucking-shitcoin).
Fuck off BCH, God I fucking hate it so much, shit.
