ITT: OP dismisses anyone who gives a thoughtful and correct answer
I did some [actual research]( for you, hopefully you will find this helpful.
Currently, the most powerful supercomputer in terms of FLOPS is the [Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Labs.]( It is powered by 27,648 Nvidia Volta V100 GPUs. These GPUs are specifically designed to accomodate large simulations, encompassing weather predictions, computational chemistry, neural networks and machine learning, etc. As others have mentioned, since these tend to rely heavily on floating point math and linear algebra, the systems are clearly not optimized for bitcoin mining.
In fact, I couldn't find any evidence anywhere that anyone has used a Volta V100 card for bitcoin mining. However, I did find someone who [used it for Ethereum mining]( and I will just use that for sake of argument... Again, we are clearly comparing apples to oranges...
The current ethereum network hashrate is 186,000,000 mh/s
A single V100 mines ethereum at 94mh/s
so 94 \* 27648 cards is 2,600,000 mh/s
2,600,000 / 186,000,000 = 1.4 % of the entire ethereum network
Based on this math we can determine that if the most powerful supercomputer in the world were to devote 100% of it's resources to mining a cryptocurrency, it would only amount to about 1.4% of the worldwide mining effort
We can take this one step further and see that bitcoin mining [has about 10x the google search presence]( compared to ethereum mining... extrapolate from that information what you will. I am pretty sure anyone who can afford a 6000 dollar GPU has more important and valuable things to do than mine cryptocurrency tho lol
hope this helps
