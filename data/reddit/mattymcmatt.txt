Is he leaving his email or a way to contact him in the message text when he transfers the coins?
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:49:28
AFAIK He's never really invested in any technology companies because he doesn't really understand how they make money.  Just look at his website!
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:49:15
If it is just due to incompetence, I think he has probably been punished enough already.  It seems like he just got in way over his head in a way that practically no one will ever experience in their lifetime. Part of it has to be ego though.  I mean, he must have received dozens of offers to buy out the business.  It's amazing he just didn't sell it, take the money and get rid of all the stress.
In his chat he wrote:


Sometimes the right decision is to "give up".   If Mt. Gox does continue, he absolutely CANNOT be a part of it.
I do kind of feel sorry for him but I say this as someone who never kept any bitcoins on Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:39:47
Plot twist. What if Mark had suspicion the government would prevent him from running normal operations and moved all the coins to a brain wallet to keep them away from being seized?

It's not your job to convince them.  I just bring up Bitcoin with people who might be interested in it - people interested in tech or the monetary system or liberty.

Exactly.  In China, a mostly cash-based society, people know they won't be protected and have anyone to rely on if things go bad.  That's why their savings rate is so high.
Contrast that to North America where everyone thinks the government will just bail them out and you have people that think they don't need to save anything or take responsibility for their future.

Security is always a trade-off with convenience.  You should have layers of security to correspond to the convenience you want.  I'm assuming most people want to spend small amounts of their bitcoin occasionally.
This setup seems to work well:
- Tiny amount (&lt; .03 BTC) - Unencrypted
- Small amount (.03 - 1 BTC) - Encrypted online computer
- Large amount (&gt; 1 BTC) - Encrypted offline computer
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:31:30
I use  for my wallet because it's very secure (although not very easy to use but with some time you can figure it out).

Ah the free market at work.  You took advantage of your monopoly position to gouge customers on fees.  It's perfectly within your right to make that business decision.  But now that VoS is threatening you you suddenly care about the community and your customers and are lowering fees.

I thought about this but I think it's unlikely due to human nature.  Hackers, like everyone else, want to get the most reward for the least effort.
They *could* write malware that leaves the original funds.  However, they might realise that if their malware could infect your computer then someone else's malware also has a good chance of infecting your computer.  The malware creator needs to trust that the other malware will not steal the funds in the unencrypted wallet as well.
It then becomes a case of "Do I take what I can and run" or "Do I take nothing and wait and hope that I can get a bigger reward later on"?

Things are going exactly according to plan.  Greed is within most of us and it's great marketing for Bitcoin.  Once a large number of people are into Bitcoin, greed becomes less a part of it and it turns more into the original purpose.  It's beautiful!

In the 1850's a group of "futurists" gathered in New York City to come up with a vision of how the world would look in a hundred years (1950's).  They said no one would live in cities anymore because, if they did, there would be so many horses and horseshit would literally be all over the place that no one would be able to move.
People didn't really want faster horses; they wanted shitless horses.

Whenever you tell people about accepting bitcoin for their business, you should tell them about BitPay at the same time.  They can accept bitcoin but receive USD and they get the advantages of not being liable to chargebacks and credit card processing fees.  With BitPay they can basically accept bitcoin but not be exposed to any risk.

This is exactly one of the reasons I got excited about bitcoin when I started looking into it about 9 months ago. I came to Reddit and saw the tip. I looked into it more and then realised "That user just sent $1 to another user. Micro-payments are here."
There were other reasons I got excited about Bitcoin but this was one of those eye-opening moments.

@_date: 2013-11-27 02:25:30
I always assumed so. Satoshi may have been working on it long before but the timing was right to release it with the number of people angry at the financial institutions and central banks.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:57:14
It could be. I hold bitcoin and want it to succeed but there are entities who have 7 billion dollars. To dismiss the possibility that it could be a pump and dump is to have binders on.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:29:57
The thing with a crash or "bubble popping" is why didn't bitcoin just disappear after the "crash" in April or after it rose to over $30 and then dropped down or earlier spikes than that.  It seems that if Bitcoin were to disappear and go to 0 that it would have happened at one of those points.  Most people who say that bitcoin is doomed to crash I think don't know the history.

Gnucash never supported it. you can find arguments on their mailing lists between the developers saying they won't support it because it's not an ISO currency and the users who need it. A huge mistake IMO - not listening to your users.

I know a few people that I would consider very smart. They also bash bitcoin.  One friend, who I always admired as being very open minded, told me "I will never ever use bitcoin."  Even smart people aren't perfect.  I guess that's why everyone is so confused that Peter Schiff is anti-bitcoin.
One of these friends is actually the reason I didn't look into bitcoin sooner. He talked about how it's a joke so I just took his word for it.  It wasn't until I researched it on my own that my views changed.
It was a good lesson for me. Even smart people are wrong sometimes. I need to look into things for myself rather than relying on other's opinions - even if they are friends or I respect them.

For capital gains, I think he meant that you get taxed on 50% of the gain....not 50% in taxes.  There's a difference.  (This is how it works in Canada)
So if the value of your BTC went up $100,000, then $50,000 has no tax applied to it and the other $50,000 is taxed at your tax rate.
Ask your accountant to clarify. IANAA

This is exactly it.  Friends are just people in your life at a certain time that happen to be on the same (or a similar) path to you.  Once you (or they) go on to a different path, the friendship dissolves.  There's nothing wrong with that.  All relationships are temporary.  I think a lot of distress comes from people who believe in Best Friends Forever type of thinking.  
I had some great friends during high school. But I went to university and they went off and did their own things.  We keep in touch every now and then but we would be trying to put a round peg in a square hole if we tried to force remaining friends at this stage.
