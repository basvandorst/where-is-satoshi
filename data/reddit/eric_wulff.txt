A billionaire club full of incompetent people? That sounds like a contradiction. You're saying they're a bunch of people who have competed at the highest levels in the game of money, yet they're incompetent?
I'm not ruling out that I should have plenty of reservations about the administration. I just want to make sure that the criticisms we come up with are rational.

Do you like Ron Paul? Look up interviews of him from 20-30 years ago, and compare his speech and sentence structure to now.
The fact of the matter is that most people speak in a slower and less complex way when they're 70 in comparison to when they're 40-50. It's just how the aging process affects many people. Dementia and senility are much deeper issues, since those terms refer not just to slowing down, but to losing one's personality, ability to engage in everyday tasks, and so forth.

Of course people with narcissism have brains that are physically different, just like individuals who are highly skilled at chess possess brain hardware which differs from the norm. I was under the assumption that it was already obvious to the average person that the physical structure of the brain is a reflection of the psychology of the person. It doesn't seem to add to our knowledge to say that people with less empathy have less brain matter tasked with producing the feeling of empathy.
I don't see why you're calling it a mental "disorder", when it's an extremely effective psychological architecture for many social situations. It seems to make quite a lot of sense that the evolutionary process would have made it such that some humans have more of a particular emotion and others less. Empathy is useful for a lot of reasons, but lacking empathy can come in handy as well. That's clear as day, when we look at all the socially successful people who lack the kind of empathy that many people have.

No, I don't think that. I see what you're saying now.
Okay, so can you elaborate on what it means for them to be "working against equality", and why that's undesirable?

I agree that he seems rather narcissistic, but I don't see why it's useful to lump that into the same category as learning disabilities and early-stage dementia. Narcissism can lead to selfish behavior that damages the welfare of other people, which explains why the discipline of mainstream psychology would put the term "disorder" after it. But make no mistake: Narcissism is simply a very effective cognitive adaptation for succeeding in certain social endeavors.
The bottom line is that there are a lot of games that look easy to outsiders, and this is one of them. If you believe Donald Trump is a power-hungry asshole, then okay. But talking about mild early-stage dementia, mental illness, and so forth, seems to suggest that you don't realize the depth of competition in politics and the extremely high level of skill that he's [so]( [consistently]( [demonstrated]( in (possibly underhanded) social signaling.
If you're trying to honestly assess and explain the character and temperament of the leader of the free world, I'm not sure why you chose the article in your first link. Afraid of stairs? He's 70 years old. Maybe he's afraid he'll fall and hurt himself. He talks back to the television? Plenty of people do that, especially if there's someone else around to comment as well. I'm not ruling out that Trump has strange habits, but I think we should consult a source that's not obviously a hit piece written by an individual who's idea of useful argumentation is a series of low blows.

What's that?
@_date: 2017-02-14 04:21:08
There are tradeoffs. Most of the politicians who make sure to be aligned with Team Science on every front are also deeply affected by many error patterns, such as misunderstandings of economics that lead to supporting socialist policies.
Do you like Ron Paul? He's Christian, and has been known to cast doubt on the theory of biological evolution. Sure, I'd prefer someone who is literally right about everything, but usually that's not a possibility. Modern propaganda runs deep, and most people who are able to break out of the paradigm will have a few wonky beliefs, since they're prepared to believe things that are considered crazy.
@_date: 2017-02-14 04:44:44
Can you give me an example of him having poor impulse control? As far as I can tell, almost all of his actions have furthered his own objectives. That doesn't sound like poor control of anything.
Note that I agree that it's possible that him furthering his own objectives is dangerous for the country as a whole. I just want to be clear about the facts, and not criticize him in irrational ways, even if ultimately we should have a lot to criticize him about.

Doesn't every government do that kind of thing? I'm sympathetic to anarcho-capitalism, so you're not going to get any pushback from me when criticizing the State's tendency to interfere with freedom of association and voluntary exchange. But I just want to be clear that this has nothing to do with Trump, and that it's merely the way every government operates.
If it's any help, note that the Trump administration seems to have given libertarianism more of a chance than almost any other major government body in recent times. Although an authoritarian at heart, it seems likely that Trump's influence will lead the United States government to become *less* robbery-oriented than many of the past administrations.

You're a good writer, but I'm not sure whether the emotion that you're creating with your words is rational.
Here's the first sentence of your post reworded to remove the negative connotation:


Again, I think what you're writing is essentially an attempt to rig the game so no matter what he does he loses. I understand that you believe his arguments about crowd size and illegal voters are false. But you think it constitutes a "tantrum" for him to voice his thoughts? It sounds like you want a world where he's caught with no good options. If he doesn't reply, what he thinks is false goes uncontested and unscrutinized; and if he does reply, he's a thin-skinned coward who can't accept even one ounce of criticism.
@_date: 2017-02-14 10:49:42
That makes sense, but I wonder why you're so concerned with the separation of church and state?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I imagine your disagreement isn't with religious habits such as praying (which can be useful for certain purposes because it's essentially a certain kind of visualization exercise, but is ultimately based on delusion about the actual nature of reality). Instead, I'm guessing that you're concerned about some of the common Christian beliefs about societal structure, such as conservative views about immigration, gender roles, racial politics, and so on.
If so, I just want to point out that far-right perspectives on immigration, gender roles, and racial politics, are certainly not dependent upon religion having a strong role in society. Both Japan and South Korea have similar views not only to each other but also to the new cultural wave in America which has led to the Trump administration coming into existence, yet the former is extremely atheistic and the latter a bit Christian.

Trump has been acting in a way which is nearly optimal for pressing the social buttons of the masses such that he gets fame, fortune, and power, and he seems to have more energy at age 70 than most people at age 30.
I don't understand why you think he may have a learning disability or early-stage dementia. It sounds like rather than considering the true meaning of those conditions, you're simply reacting to having a deep disagreement with him. Sure, it's okay if you think he's deeply misguided or highly manipulative. Maybe he is. But jumping to the "mental illness" term seems like reaching. Holding views that are wrong doesn't equate to brain damage.
@_date: 2017-02-14 05:10:24
I just watched the clip. I don't know the backstory, but it seemed like a joke. I'm not contesting that Trump probably disagrees with the person they're referring to and wants his own will to prevail, but given the upward intonation that Trump used, the laughing in the room, and his slight smile at the end, it seems clear that he didn't mean they were actually going to try to destroy the person's career.
@_date: 2017-02-13 16:58:32
What reservations do you have about the administration?
@_date: 2017-02-14 04:40:35
Why do you believe he has a case of "thin skin", when it seems equally plausible that he's simply very consistent in skirting around the media by communicating directly to the public in an effort to strike back when he thinks he's being unfairly attacked?
I don't know what the facts are surrounding the inauguration turnout, but let's assume for a moment that Trump is right that the media used conveniently timed and angled photos to make the turnout look like it was less than it actually was. If Trump says nothing, the dishonest reporting stands uncontested, and if he says something in opposition, many people call him "thin skinned" for being so easily "bent out of shape". Isn't that a bit of a rigged system? Heads I win, tails you lose.

Your link says that it exists due to an act of Congress and that it gives almost 98% of its profits to the US Treasury. That sounds like a governmental agency to me.
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:02:28
I can safely conclude that you have an unusual definition of "governmental agency".
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:42:49
You're not telling me anything new. I just think it's strange to not want to use the term "governmental agency" to describe it. A stateless society would by definition not have a central bank. It's a creature of the government, and thus a "governmental agency" by the normal sense of the term.
@_date: 2017-01-14 10:36:09
I have two questions:
1. Do you have a busy life full of a lot of obligations for work and family?
2. Do you experience procrastination on a regular basis?
@_date: 2017-01-14 11:02:26
I haven't used Twitter, but I assume there might be pitfalls such as being able to check one's Twitter feed from a logged-out state and see a bit of activity that one would feel compelled to reply to. Plenty of people nuke their Reddit accounts in order to break their addiction, for instance, even if they could do what you said and change the password to a random string and then log out.
Assuming you have few obligations or minimal tendency to procrastinate, it might be difficult for you to understand what may go through someone's mind when trying to kick an addiction to an Internet activity. I've seen plenty of people nuke their accounts without being high-profile individuals who care about public perception. It's a standard option for dealing with Internet addiction.
@_date: 2017-01-14 11:05:19
It's simply the nuclear option. If you want to "walk away from Facebook for a while", you just don't log in. Sure, that's reasonable. But what if you want to completely destroy your connection to Facebook and not use it anytime in the foreseeable future because you think it's toxic and you see it as a terrible waste of time? Then you would likely nuke your account, just as Srinivasan did with his Twitter feed.
@_date: 2017-01-14 09:58:27
How likely do you think it is that a hacker would have struck right when the news about his possible FDA position surfaced, and then delete his entire Twitter feed and replace it with a tweet that sounds like it could have been written by him?
The much simpler answer is that Srinivasan wanted to either remove easy public access to his old tweets, some of which may have been inflammatory, or he wanted to stop wasting so much time arguing on Twitter since perhaps he's about to get a lot busier with the FDA position (or something else), so he destroyed his account.
@_date: 2017-01-14 06:42:10
Maybe he's about to get a lot more busy, and he wants to stop wasting time on Twitter. It's an extremely addictive website, after all. There are more reasons to delete one's Twitter feed than trying to destroy history.
@_date: 2017-01-14 06:44:25
You can't think of any other [reason]( that he may have wanted to delete his Twitter feed besides that he's trying to cover up controversial statements that he may have made in the past?
@_date: 2017-01-14 06:35:02
He replaced his whole Twitter feed with a single [tweet]( and the content of the tweet makes the deletion seem like it was intentional.

Is reducing Trump's maximum loan balance a viable strategy for certain people who are trying to sway his policy choices? That is, are you aware of which institutions would be involved, how that would be implemented, and so forth? Or are you just coming up with an off-the-cuff example, with the idea being that there's probably *some* way that certain powers in the government could threaten Trump's businesses and therefore influence his presidential decisions?

Can you give me an example of him acting as a cronyist on the corporate side?

Why? (Just wondering what your reasoning is, besides the point made in this thread.)
@_date: 2016-11-12 20:08:54
Well they've been helping for his whole campaign. What's wrong with them continuing to help? It's not like they're being given independent decision-making power in an arbitrarily chosen position.
@_date: 2017-04-26 11:59:11
That's an interesting suggestion. Would you mind giving a source?
@_date: 2016-10-08 18:00:08
You seem to be reading into his or her post a bit too much. I didn't detect any upset emotions.

Can you give me an example of a term he used which he didn't really understand?

What does it mean to fire the Bitcoin Core developers? I thought Bitcoin was an open-source project, not a company with an internal power structure where certain people have the ability to hire and fire.
