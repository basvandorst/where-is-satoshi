Which was in 2011, still quite a while back. In fact, one can argue that as Gox has become more popular, they've been able to make more money and allocate that money into securing the backend of their site. Of course, that is all speculation, and it's really just as speculative as saying that these past security problems are indicative of further holes.

I'm sorry I guess I wasn't clear to begin with, but I was asking why Greenspan declares that deficit spending is wealth compensation? Obviously I will admit that wealth compensation is a crime, as you said, but I don't yet see that deficit spending is a crime.
The crux of your arguments (you and the original commentator's) seems to rest on the Greenspan quote, and I don't see that as ample evidence. I don't think what the Fed does is as simplistically caricatured as "one party paying for goods with printed money." The reality seems to be more complicated, as it is not physical goods that the Fed purchases but securities that are intended to expand the economy. And even if it was as simplistic as what has been described, wouldn't the act of destroying old money through restrictive policy counterbalance the ill-effects of deficit spending, if indeed there are such effects? What I was asking is if someone could provide a more complete explanation.
I don't feel as if I've been overly stubborn in requesting such an explanation.

It's tricky for mail providers not to provide security questions because the standard method of password recovery is to email a person a new password. Although lately I like the idea of SMS recovery, where you can tie your mail account to a verified phone number and use that in addition to security questions.

Proof is irrelevant? I'm not saying it's outside the bounds of possibility that they were truly compromised but saying they were hacked without proof is silly. In fact, it borders on paranoia.
"Server logs" isn't some magic buzzword that automatically means your site is audited. Secure servers and audits are much harder than one might think, especially over a long period of time. There have been cases of websites noticing anomalies that have happened months ago.
And again, your suspicions seem more like paranoia to me. There are doubts, and then there are unreasonable doubts.
I will say that it is absolutely appropriate to be suspicious about Bitcoinica, I hadn't realized the "ruse" you were talking about earlier was related to them actually having the motive to steal the money themselves. But such is what you get when you play with unregulated markets of a crypto-currency: for any advantage there is a trade-off one must consider.

I think it's silly to think that there is a causal relationship between the Fed issuing statements and the rising value of btc.

You say I'm naive but you offer no substantive explanation on why you think what you think. You can give a witticism or a quotation but can you actually provide reasons you assert what you do? Do you really think the comments you've made provide an adequate means for a reasonable person to be swayed?

Anecdotal proof at best, and I'd argue there are far bigger contributing factors.

Elsewhere in this thread I argue that LastPass was _not_ hacked, at least there is no evidence to definitively say such. It was a freakin' traffic anomaly and later they blogged that their response was probably overdone. I'm not "confused and incensed," I just dislike people making completely baseless statements. And to suggest I have some relation or investment in LastPass is insulting.
Sharing passwords with a third party is not the safest solution. The safest solution is to memorize sufficiently secure, unique passwords, to change them once a month, and so forth. However, it is certainly a sensible idea to use LastPass, given the very secure encryption used, the proven responsiveness and accountability from the company, and the ease of use. Because I use many different websites, LastPass allows me to use secure and unique passwords that I can access elsewhere, which is invaluable to me. The tradeoff for that access is that it somewhat simplifies the security of all my online accounts such that one password is all that is necessary for compromise. However, since I am removed the burden of remembering hundreds of passwords, I can simply use one very good password (and not a fucking duplicate, as Bitcoinica used).
Coupled with two-factor authentication (which removes the threat of keyloggers sniffing my master password, since any would-be hacker would have to have the Yubikey that sits securely on my desk), I find that LastPass is a _very_ sensible solution when one considers the alternatives.
You could say I have an investment in LastPass as I use it everyday, and rely on it. But I've also done my fair share of research to make sure it is suitable for me, which is more than I can say for you.

Err, "my opponent's position" was never made clear to me past the analogy that households couldn't inflate the money supply. The notion that a whole behaves or acts the same as its parts _is_ fallacious. Don't pretend I sidestepped some really well thought out argument, nothing like that has been presented within this comment thread.
You've stated that it is unethical to inflate the money supply, but I could counter that economics or monetary policy need not be subject to ethics. But it's not entirely clear the manner in which it is unethical to inflate the money supply, especially when it would appear that inaction would lead to a grossly unstable dollar; maybe you could explain the ethics of the situation. Stability is thought to be a key thing as far as markets are concerned, so maybe you could explain why inaction does not affect the market is in this manner, or why such an effect is a good thing, or so on.
If you want an actual discussion on this subject, I implore you to do more than call me names.
@_date: 2012-08-04 01:11:21
What I meant was that such anecdotal proof is not significant enough to really be worth saying, and certainly don't indicate a causal relationship. "I bought BTC because the stars aligned" does not offer a legitimate causal relationship either.
@_date: 2012-08-04 01:33:54
That is a grossly simplistic view of how printing money works, at least in the United States in our present system.

Even the safest password keeper is only as safe as the person using it. If you're going to be stupid and use a duplicate password for the master password, then you might as well use a fucking post-it note. This was Bitcoinica, not LastPass, and if you think otherwise then you have absolutely no idea the lengths that LastPass goes to secure their data.
Speaking of not having a clue, the paranoia that the recent credit monitoring feature is "dirty looking" is hilarious. You either have no idea what that is or are just altogether paranoid of the service altogether, and in either case you haven't a clue. I'd direct you to the very detailed help page on the feature but I fear you'd abstain from clicking because of the threat that the entire domain is captured, that you'll get a keylogger, that maybe upon clicking you'll contract a deadly autoimmune virus and start to hack up blood.
LastPass is a company. They charge for premium services, they have a physical headquarters, they have to obey all the laws that any other company would have to obey. Bitcoinica, on the other hand, is not a company, and by nature of decentralized currency has no one to answer to but themselves. So I understand the criticism of Bitcoinica but I again repeat that LastPass is absolutely, unequivocally not to blame in this situation.
@_date: 2012-07-13 20:00:32
First of all you will notice I used the keyword "definitively." While it is true that the security of LastPass has been in question in the past, there has not been an actual proven breach. In the articles you cited (I had guessed you were referring to last year's event), the only thing that is known for sure is that there was a network anomaly that may or may not have been a security breach. And LastPass' handling of the situation was exactly appropriate: not only did they have measures in place to detect such anomalies but they alerted users of trouble at the _very first sign_, and made a password reset recommended to all users (I don't quite remember if it was a mandatory reset, the blog entry seems to imply it was optional).
All that to say, I don't think LastPass is to blame for this Bitcoinica thing. Even the most expensive safes are only as secure as the person holding the key. What you have here is a classic password vulnerability, which is ironically enough the reason LastPass exists: by only remembering one key, you can ensure that _every account you use has a unique, secure key_. Obviously for this to work you shouldn't use a duplicate key!
And there is nothing to really suggest that some criminal hacker gang is responsible for this exploitation. As far as I can tell, source code was leaked which contained a secret key that matched the password being used in Lastpass, which was tied to a well known email address for the website.
Bitcoinica has absolutely no one to blame but themselves.

But saying "my household cannot print more money, therefore the government can't or shouldn't" is a fallacy.
@_date: 2012-08-04 01:18:25
So... Printing money is a "crime against humanity" because Alan Greenspan was quoted as talking about deficit spending? I fail to see how that really explained your original statement, now I'm just wondering, in addition to what you originally meant, why you felt that that was a suitable explanation.
I've learned that printing currency is a tool that the Fed uses for expansionary policy, just as destroying old money is a tool for restrictive policy. Can you offer a more convincing case of why you think this is not true and, moreso, a criminal offense (which I find rather ridiculous), without quoting someone on about it?

@_date: 2013-04-17 11:31:32
I do wonder if there are any statistics on percentage of chargebacks, though. For large items I imagine it would be far worse (more to gain from a chargeback), so logically I would think the % sales charged back for cheaper digital goods would be pretty low.
Also, by eliminating chargebacks you just shift the burden from producer to the consumer who now has no action to take against failed sales.
Biggest advantage is eliminating the middle man and thereby getting rid of the transaction fees.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:40:42
In net-sec, security through obscurity is a bad policy, which is essentially what you're suggesting. True, it's good not to paint a target on your back, but your security methods should be sufficient such that even if people know what you have, they are not able to steal it. Keeping encrypted, offline backups of your bitcoin is a far better security policy.
