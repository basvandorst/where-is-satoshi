yeah, also "KAFFEE" on pic 5, almost like "kaffe" in danish. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 15:07:00
yeah my bad. 
i might look into hardware-wallets
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:47:49
i know that it was just meant as a joke. (i see that i should not have said that) 
i must say that community around dogecoin, seems to be much much more giving, and sharing. 
but i guess a lot of the bitcoin users here got here after hearing about the crazy 30-100$ grow. (or any other of the amazing spikes we have had the last year)
so i guess i see the dogg coin community is more abou the community, and bitcoin is about being here while wating for price to go up. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:09:15
YEAH! 
Thanks for making me feel better 
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:01:25

@_date: 2015-01-15 13:52:27

@_date: 2015-01-15 14:14:17
heh yeah, i remember 2011. me and my friend wanted to start mining, and needed a place to have a PC running 24/7 (we made one that would lost us about 1000$ and would give a return on about 100-110$ a week at that time.
but our parrents talked out of it, beacouse 1000$ was allot for two guy in their first year of highschool. just got into again when i was in thailand, when the price was going from 30-100+ (and i was kicking myslef for so long for not buying bitcoins instead of going to thailand.) but bought some when i got home. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:28:59
also helped me thanks. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 16:58:25

@_date: 2015-01-15 13:55:31

@_date: 2015-01-11 20:28:16
i had issues no matter what data i used. 
i am from Denmark. 
(i just tryed to open my bread wallet again after using hive to send it to my main wallet, and it seems like it is having truble updating (it still says i have my bitcoins) 
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:31:56

@_date: 2015-01-11 14:24:54
yes i did, you know what to do? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 12:04:48
nope :( by our i meant the "Standard" or more known brand in denmark.
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:53:14

@_date: 2015-01-11 14:26:26
thanks. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 16:59:24
i did the hive thing thanks :) 
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:45:08
I do agree 100% 
but Blockchain.info got so much more info than just bread wallet. and once you click the set up "bitcoin" and you click the "get wallet" most people might want to also know what it actually is they are getting. 
but there is a fine line between to much info and the amount of info that makes people want to investigate himself. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:18:20
that i sjust the link they give to start you up. i use my bred waller with no problem :D 
@_date: 2014-12-27 15:07:21
yeah hardware-wallets might bee what i need thanks.
@_date: 2015-01-15 10:11:02
your logo look slike the one our icecreamtrucks are using :D 
cool idea. hope it will spread. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:45:00
sure it will...... this is not btc-e chat you know? 
@_date: 2015-01-23 10:10:24
you wut m8? you cant see my screenshot? 
@_date: 2016-11-25 17:31:49
thanks man, the design is pretty terrible, super hard to see. But thanks my dude. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:54:02
i might go for the TREZOR again then . But thanks for the help. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:47:43
i remember that the TREZOR also uses the 12-24 seed, does that mean that you can get the coin, just as easy as the lagder? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:23:07
i see, no matter what i do i have to have a piece of paper, that i need to take care of. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:49:36
yeah, i gave ben thinking about a paper wallet, but i dont trust myself to kepp track af a slip of paper. and i am afraid that i will tear it, it will break or the it will fade away. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 20:36:17
That´s a great Read, is there any site where I can see how the price have went up and down the past 4-5 months? I seems like I inly can go back a month on mt.gox?  
just to get a bether pickture on how the prices are doing up and down from month to month 
@_date: 2013-01-29 08:25:34
i just read the The number mined every day is constant, in 2011 it was 50 per 10 minutes, 300 per hour, 7200 per day. And that i dropedin 2013 to 3600 a day, and continue to halve every four years.
@_date: 2013-10-28 09:50:49
i know a lot of them wish to stay anonymous, and i might forgot to say that i will not use any name if, they dont want to to be public. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:17:30
so how does that work? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:31:55
what was the bug?? that sound crazy :/
@_date: 2013-02-13 17:43:53
Yeah that is what i was thinkig to, but this is in a controled inviorment :/ so the numbers wont be 100% true but i thinkig gives you a pretty good idea of how it Can look like :) 
@_date: 2013-01-28 19:34:12
i did the mistake to preorder the jala, and after doing my research, i see the massive delay they have had on all the preorders. 
but i am going on a trip next month and i will be back early may, and by then the market should be stabilized after all the ASIC units have hid the market. 
(luckily i haven’t paid for the jala yet)
@_date: 2013-06-26 20:12:44
thanks for the help, i think i have to finde the pest paper wallet then :) thanks
@_date: 2013-02-16 19:51:49
Thanks for the quick, answer do you now any other good sites where you can buy coins, other than mt.gox? I am form Denmark, so bitinstant is not an option for me :( 
@_date: 2013-09-28 20:35:09
pretty cool site, and i got my BTC so fast +1
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:52:19
true, they are starting to get sneaky. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 03:13:11
go post it on the SC2 board to :) (dunno if you already have) 
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:32:52
i have no idea, i thought it would go to 25-26$ so i was planing on selling around 25.5
@_date: 2013-10-28 08:04:32
did not get anything :( 
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:34:37


why is casascius bad?? i know i have to pay for the "coin" as a fee but? a piece of paper can get lost of breat pretty easy? 
@_date: 2013-05-10 17:31:22
so if i downloaded all the PDF files, adn gave them to some1 who had the knowlage and the resources, he could make me some ASIC boards redy to mine? 
@_date: 2013-09-04 06:41:20
how was btcjam? i was thinking about investing in the "reputation loan" since that might be the most safe to invest in. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:32:11
not trubbel..... work help call i what you want. 
@_date: 2013-01-28 21:12:57
you might be right there,but what will happen  when allthe coins ore mined up? 
i did not rely think of the when i was planing on buy a rig.
Edit: is there a way to see how many Coins there is left to mine?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:53:20
NO! THEY ARE ALL MINE!!!!!
@_date: 2013-02-16 19:10:14
Starting to get into bitcoin, got a wallet and i am waiting for mt.gox to confirm me, so I can get started. I only have one question rely, do you guys think the prices will take a “dive” soon, or should I buy coins now? also +1 to the you guys are great. All-round helpful sub, and people who aren’t afraid to help newbies out. can’t wait to become more Active inhere
@_date: 2013-01-28 19:36:42
yeah you are right on that one, buti havent seen many other companies with any ASIC units out there. What companies do you sugest? if i am planing on getting in to mining again? (starting in May) i canr find any companies at the moment, that have nay units up.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:59:08
just spend them all on drugs when the price starts to dip? then you have no money and loads of drugs. 
@_date: 2013-09-03 16:14:09
Thanks for the good reply. i might just hold on to my coins, and then just buy more coins with my own money when i can. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 07:51:51
That look awesome! i want to try this out, just need a few more days to get more bitcoins :) 
@_date: 2013-06-05 07:21:08

@_date: 2013-02-13 16:20:33
 
@_date: 2013-04-28 08:03:29
will it bee a good idea to run a few BFL miners on this. or will there be allot of down time. 
i thought about buying one, so i can use it as a wallet. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 20:51:59
