Independent of any PRNG bugs, etc., I was imagining perhaps realized qt was online at the time (or after) the addresses were created.  If I had created the addresses when the coin was worthless, I might decide later to move to addresses created entirely offline, with zero network exposure, ever.  Modulo other factors, offline address creation is certainly more secure.

"If a significant number of relay nodes refuse to remember very-small-fee transactions in their memory pools (perhaps they are dropping them because they run into CPU or bandwidth limits) then miners have an incentive not to include them in their blocks."  Dumb question...  Why couldn't someone set up a large number of relay nodes that conveniently 'forget' transactions to or from particular addresses?  If their specific behavior is well publicized, wouldn't it be an evil way to achieve address blacklisting without having to become a mining superpower?  Miners would have an incentive to ignore the transactions that they know many relay nodes forget.  Am I on to something here?Edit: Thinking about it, I guess if your transaction were "blocked" by this scheme you could just pay a slightly higher transaction fee to get a miner to take the (small) risk and put it in a block regardless.

Yes, but another aspect of a paper wallet is that it's generally unavailable to anyone but yourself, encryption is just an extra layer of defense.  On your second point, for paranoid people, trading a properly generated private key for a "good passphrase" isn't so appealing.

More than anything else it's simply a cycle.  Graph the price over the last few years on a log scale and see for yourself.  It's not magic either, this happens for a number of good reasons.  For example, consider how as the price rises, miners need to sell less and less, creating a positive feedback loop until the bubble pops.  At the low point in the cycle miners are selling all they have just to pay their electricity bill.

@_date: 2014-10-29 19:03:25
This is fantastic.  One thought though...  It does still seem slightly less desirable than hardcore paper wallet usage in some sense.  That is, for as long as your coins are in the multisig vault, coinbase or something acting on their behalf can be attempting to crack the encrypted shared key.  Once they do that, coins can be taken, if only by coinbase.  You could say that would be hard, but brute forcing a private key (the pure paper wallet approach) is clearly harder.  Does my argument here have any merit?

But you're going to keep encountering people (like me) who don't have your worldview and do believe there's a potential problem here.  What if instead of simply saying "No, you're wrong" you suggest that if somehow there is a problem, tax incentives or other techniques could restore any lost innovation / spending.  Wouldn't you agree that if there does turn out to be a problem, it would be quantifiable via measurement?  So then what's it matter to you, given that you believe strongly that there's no hoarding problem and thus such tax incentives would never ultimately be put in place anyway?
The benefit of this approach is that it suggests a world where Bitcoin is not inherently dangerous to folks who believe it might be.  Rational people won't support a crackdown on an innovative technology unless there's no other option.  Give them an option.
@_date: 2012-12-31 08:56:17
This seems orthogonal.  There are lots of ways to avoid taxes with or without Bitcoin.  And the existence of Bitcoin doesn't affect the percentage of the population willing to engage in tax evasion.
I suggest that Bitcoin fundamentally creates a rewarding alternative investment opportunity for folks who do pay their taxes and abide by the law.  (And also for folks who don't.)  It's rewarding to the extent that Bitcoin may make people shift from investing in innovative endeavors.
@_date: 2012-12-31 08:47:15
Seriously, go re-read what I said.  I am pro-Bitcoin.  It has a bright future no matter what.
I'm NOT suggesting changing Bitcoin to solve this problem.  I'm suggesting solutions _outside_ of Bitcoin so we don't wind up in a dystopia.  And that's only if we actually seem to be heading in that direction, or if Bitcoin is losing the battle for hearts and minds over this.  I admit that I can't see into the future and I don't know how things will play out.
Finally, I don't know where the "manipulative rhetoric" stuff is coming from...  The only thing I can see is that you could reasonably suggest I'm not big on Austrian economics.  Sorry 'bout that, it wasn't really my focus here.
@_date: 2012-12-31 18:42:18
Tax evasion is a different issue, plain and simple.  I'm certainly not suggesting any way that Bitcoin could solve the very real problem of tax evasion.  It shouldn't and it can't.Lost you after "Nice one." Are you essentially suggesting I'm using floury language but ultimately saying nothing of value?  I'd of course disagree.  :-)

Sorry, I'm new to the usage of TL;DR; too, I thought it's supposed to be blunt.  =)  But seriously, I read this subreddit quite a bit these days and I know the folks here to be quite intelligent.


That's basically my definition of "handwavey."  I've summarized what seems like a rational argument as to why price deflation may be bad.  I don't see a simple and compelling argument to the contrary.  Am I the only one who feels this way?
In any case, it's clear that even if you don't believe price deflation could be detrimental, some people do.  Those folks might be inclined to back any potential future "Bitcoin crackdown" if they weren't presented with other more tolerant options.
@_date: 2012-12-31 09:09:41
Finally a reply I can upvote.  =)
I can get behind the "it's really no big deal" argument here to a large extent.  Couple of points I'd make though...
IMO, we've got a long slow climb for a long time to come before we reach the point where Bitcoin has 100% "caught on."  I could be convinced this will take the rest of my lifetime, if not longer.  So given a forecast for &gt;11% increases year over year, perhaps a dystopia could start to appear in maybe 10 years or so.  I'll hopefully still be alive then.  I could care less if it gets mostly better 100 years from now though.  =)
Also, some of this is just about the _perception_ that deflation is bad.  Rather than telling people "don't worry about it, it's probably no biggie," wouldn't it be great if we could suggest potential solutions society could pursue if it actually turns out to hurt?  Imagine if that made the public at large less likely to back some idiotic crushing Bitcoin regulation?
@_date: 2012-12-31 09:13:45
Look, I said I was blunt.  That's all you're gonna get me to fess up to on this one.
@_date: 2012-12-31 19:22:58
The price of Bitcoins get very high relative to what?  People are buying more Bitcoins now than ever before even though the price has increased tremendously.  This is not a phenomenon unique to Bitcoins.  So it's not about the perceived price being "high" but rather the incentive to buy Bitcoins is about the perceived future price tomorrow.  It will always be the case that a Bitcoin tomorrow is more rare and thus (absent other factors) more valuable than a Bitcoin today.  Thus there will _always_ be an incentive to hoard.  
(Of course the price could fall for years on end due to a bubble bursting.  I'm talking about incentives, not the actual market price.)
@_date: 2012-12-31 08:33:28


They don't shy away, they die away.  Who makes desktop PCs anymore?  There's a lot less money there than there used to be, and thus less innovation.  Except Apple, where they've managed to innovate and charge premium prices.
But yeah I could have picked a better example.  Just look at the whole of modern capitalism...  In large parts of the world innovation (based on investment) is rewarded, and thus economies have grown and everyone is better off.  It doesn't work like that everywhere in the world though...  You could blame that on various things, but I personally think that the incentives people have on how / where to invest are important in enabling economic success.

Yes, that's right, it would be silly to leave your money in an inflationary fiat currency.  It would _not_ be silly to put your money in Bitcoin.  Assuming no unanticipated catastrophe, I suspect that any given individual will do quite well with Bitcoin.  That's been the story so far at least.  And in fact it's the very premise of my argument.
I'm saying that Bitcoin is potentially bad for society overall.  At some point everyone will have saved up a whole lot of dough, but they won't be able to benefit from all the wonderful innovation...  Innovation which never actually ended up happening due to lack of investment.  Why would anyone invest their hard earned money in a risky project when they can get a better return as provided by Bitcoin?  Today they invest their hard earned money because the system forces them to.

While I haven't used brain wallets before, I suspect this is exactly the kind of thing to be cautious about.

And the attacker has all the time the money is in that address to do the brute forcing.  Any crypto ppl here care to comment?

And AAPL stock also "moves up and down" too.  BTC value has **exploded** in the few years that it's been a thing, plain and simple.


I look at investments rationally.  I don't invest in stocks for the fun of it.  I'm not into gambling for entertainment.  I invest because the risk / reward is the best fit for me.  Bitcoin fundamentally changes the calculus, not just for me but for everyone.  And, assuming I'm not the only one who thinks rationally, there _is_ a consequence to society as a whole.


News flash: This is the world we live in already.  If you're in the US, you're being pushed into stocks by what's happening with the US dollar.  Likewise, if you're in the US, you're pushed into investing in buying a home because of the mortgage interest credit on your taxes.  If you think about why the system is set up to incentivize these activities it suggests some reasons the US has become a great place to live vs. some other parts of the world.

What we've seen since Jan doesn't seem to correspond to some rapid increase in press attention.  I have a theory...  Given the interest by the gaming industry, could it be the case that we're seeing a few of those companies purchase the initial batch of coins necessary to set up shop?  Gaming isn't my thing, but I would imagine that a large site would easily want to have $10K in coins onhand for a launch.  This is complete speculation though.  
Otherwise, if this isn't the case (and perhaps even if it is), I say things are looking a bit bubbly.  But what do I know, Google trends on "bitcoin" is about at its maximum for the past 12 month period.

If Russia is OK with Bitcoin then it just attracts everyone who is interested in Bitcoin from around the world.  Investors, people looking to cash out, etc. but most importantly the technologists who will build the future many people on this forum are anticipating.

The unfortunate thing is that in our lifetimes it probably can never win on the safety metric vs many other investment options.  Ten years from now someone clever could still find a killer design flaw.  But, that being said, every day that Bitcoin survives in good health it gets a tiny bit safer.

There's no argument here about the monetary value of Bitcoin.  What I'm talking about is related to the social impact of Bitcoin.
Think about Huguette Clark vs. Elon Musk.  Huguette Clark hoarded all her money.  Elon Musk on the other hand made money from PayPal, then went and invested in Tesla and SpaceX.  Not only did that turn out to be a great investment for him, but it turned out to be great for everybody.  You can now go out and buy an amazingly innovative car that otherwise wouldn't exist if Mr. Musk hadn't invested.
Now, think about the distribution of the Huguette Clarks and Elon Musks of the world, throughout space and time.  Why is it that in some places, like the US in particular, the Musks seem to consistently dominate?  You could consider political factors, cultural differences, or any number of things.  But IMO what it really comes down to is that the incentives are set up in the US such that investment in legal and productive activity is rewarded.  Bitcoin screws with that thoughtfully designed incentive system.

I do agree that the discussion on this needs to be taken up a notch.  I haven't seen a great attempt to seriously discuss the potential outcomes over the next five to ten years.  That may be because at least right now, the future is about as unpredictable as it ever will be.  I like the fact that things will only get more clear as time goes on, and that certainty only helps Bitcoin.
The government interference is almost certainly inevitable.  But it may be less intrusive than most people expect.  No one individual in government would want to start an unwinnable battle.  And this is not like a hardcore drug we're talking about, it's something fundamentally new with properties that are clearly innovative and useful.  Plus, think of the coordination that would be required by nations in order to truly "ban" Bitcoin.  How exactly would that come together, especially in the context of global rivalries?  I think the really hostile attacks on Bitcoin would be reserved for some future point where it really is a clear and present danger to authority.  Finally, think about how complex this is for a government to understand and come to terms with.  Expect a lot of indecision, and that helps Bitcoin have enough time to spread its roots.
Something else to think about...  We've crossed the point of no return in terms of creating a fully self-sustaining ("closed loop?") economy.  Sure there will likely come a day when various exchanges start to get harassed and shut down.  Bitcoin value will crash that day, no doubt.  But then what?  The coins are still out there, and people may then be more inclined to use them.  You'll have fewer places to spend them, but you can imagine that a couple of VPNs out there still take them.  Then those VPNs in turn can still spend them for their web hosting, etc.  The coins will circulate and the economy will continue to grow and extend out in whatever directions it can.  At some point, probably within a few years, Bitcoin will have regained its strength.  It's hard to say exactly where things go after that, but I don't think the answer is that bitcoin goes away.  Funny thing about Bitcoin -- though governments can likely succeed in making them less useful, they can't make them any less rare.
All things considered, in the long run I'm more worried about unforeseen technical problems or a "better mousetrap" than I am with government actions.

Great reporting.  But it always blows my mind how people find the need to justify the situation by looking at world news, etc.  This is not a stock people.  Bitcoin may be impossible to predict day by day, but it's amazingly predictable on a longer timeframe.  It was _designed_ to do what it is doing.  Expect more of the same until there is a fundamental change to the narrative, at which point anything could happen.  Such a change has yet to occur, but we're only like 5 years in.  Enjoy this bubble, then enjoy the next, scheduled for around 9-12 months from now.(Oh, and I'm not saying this rise isn't due to China, it obviously is.  But if not China it would still happen the same, give or take a month.)

If the US bans Bitcoin then just spend / exchange any bitcoin you have outside the US.  Or sit on it and wait for more favorable conditions.  And certainly a US ban on Bitcoin only makes it more attractive for other nations to encourage and support, just to give the US a bit of a hard time.
If exchanges go dark, we may wake up one day and Bitcoin actually won't even have a price in USD.  But the coins will be floating around out there and people will recognize it has some value, albeit less than before.  (Or maybe more, if an exchange takedown kills a ton of coins!)  Pretty soon we'd have ways to come to some kind of consensus on what the real price is again.
I agree a ban is not that far fetched, but an _effective_ ban is far fetched.  Drugs are banned, but they still exist and have value -- and drugs are real physical things with all the hassles of having to manage that.
The size of the underground economy is absolutely massive relative to Bitcoin's current size.  And if Bitcoin is successful, it may be that what we call the underground economy today becomes just what we call "the economy" in the future.  If you have a bunch of Bitcoins already sitting in your pocket, it kind of changes your perspective on participating in an economy that otherwise you wouldn't touch.  We've already reached the point where a great many people have coins at their disposal.  You'd have to be stupid to run to an exchange to cash out as they are being shut down by the government.
Remember software and music piracy of years past?  What is that even today?  (Not that these things are any more legal than before, but the world has changed to make the ideas sort of antiquated.)  The whole model is just way different, and I expect that what we will get with Bitcoin in ten years will be a different and changed world as well.

Not sure about this service specifically, but more stuff like this is sorely needed.  The majority of Bitcoin users out there (like me) actually pay their taxes.  And right now it's a real hassle, which is a strong incentive not to spend.  But there is no fundamental reason why the whole thing can't just be automated so you can just import a file into TurboTax and be done with it.
@_date: 2013-01-04 07:24:23
The point is not necessarily that it will deflate forever, but for a good part of at least the next few decades.  (Or it will implode.  I don't think many people believe there is a middle ground.)  Bitcoin is just orders of magnitude smaller than it needs to be in order to fulfill its promise.  It can't get there overnight though.
As you say, it's impossible for to hoard 100% of your income.  But it's not a black &amp; white type of thing.  Don't you think that if we even lost 25% of the investment currently present in the economy, that would be catastrophic?  New products would never be created and people would lose their jobs.  Of course they'd be sitting on some bitcoins, but what's it matter at that point?


I think in the first sentence above you essentially agree there would be delayed and weakened spending.  What I don't understand is the second sentence...  What's inflating?  Bitcoin?  And if this is a good thing, isn't it still based on delayed and weakened spending, so it would seem to be just a shadow of the benefit that would be observed if Bitcoin / hoarding never happened.
@_date: 2013-01-01 08:59:53


It absolutely is -- on an individual level.  But if everyone is doing this, I suggest that it might be hard for society to remain innovative.  I don't really know, but at least I think this could be the case.
So yes, you could say that if you're fully invested in Bitcoins and nothing else, you'd be slightly "punished" in that you'd pay more taxes than your neighbor who has decided to take advantage of my imagined tax-free spending / investing incentive plan.  But I'd say that's a small price to pay if the alternative is that Bitcoins are effectively banned due to the concern that they might harm investing / spending.  And remember, the tax incentives would only ever be put into place if actual measurable weakness in investing / spending were shown to exist.
And as for Freicoin...  I love Bitcoin for its unique properties and the fact that it's catching on in the real world.  I don't want to use some other valueless offshoot.

I'm more interested in when Namecheap's competition starts accepting Bitcoin.

I think a lot more people would trust a client-side app that didn't explicitly send all their transaction info to a third party.  Of course you still need to query a block chain API for the addresses, but that's not quite as scary, imo.

Social norms vary pretty significantly across time and space.  You'd never run a red light in the US, but you can go to plenty of places in the world where red lights are more of a suggestion than anything else.  If something is pervasive and the thinking is "everybody does it," then that plays into this mindset.  Bitcoin has the potential to acquire those properties.  To some extent it already has -- is Bitcoin explicitly legal today?
Second, I think the "ban at the stroke of a pen" that had been suggested earlier in the discussion is unrealistic.  That just isn't consistent with the past behavior of the US government.  So how would things play out?  Well, there has to be a catalyst to trigger some action.  It seems drugs would be the likely first target.  But why would Bitcoin get the heavy hand instead of Tor, Silk Road, or the people handling the drugs?  Those would fall victim to attack first, and then once the discussion has moved on to Bitcoin, the actual "ban" would need to be a ban on virtual currencies to avoid a loophole.  How are virtual currencies defined properly so as not to interfere with "good" things?  It seems there are a lot of places for the whole process to get stuck before a real enforced ban might ever show up.
And of course Bitcoin could get regulated in a limited way that isn't really relevant to its overall success or isn't really new/bad -- eg: monitoring on all exchange user accounts, etc.  An outright ban is isn't particularly defensible and creates more enemies than is necessary to address the perceived issue.  Anything less than an outright ban actually validates Bitcoin to a degree and removes some amount of uncertainty.
All things considered, I do expect to see a lot of loose talk of a Bitcoin ban from politicians.  But will it really happen?  Nobody can say for sure at this point, but my best guess is that we'll wind up with regulation of some form but not an outright ban.
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:01:48

It's idiotic to think that there might be a situation so egregiously bad that a majority would want to take action to protest a particular bitcoin address?
@_date: 2013-05-16 06:21:29
The more trouble Gox appears to be in, the more incentive people have to get their fiat to BTC and off the exchange.  (Trying to go the other direction would be taking a bigger risk, by far.)  I think that's what's happening now, to some extent, and it's the reason the price hasn't fallen too much.
So if Gox closes, the last quoted price might be relatively high.  And then people would find it hard to accept a significantly lower price at a lesser known exchange as the "real" authoritative price of BTC.

The basic problem is that people would be more likely to sit in their caves, hoarding money by not spending it and not investing it.  Personally, I like my iPad and I'd love to continue to use future innovations sponsored by spending / investment.  
Seriously -- If you have cash you need to do something with it.  You'd have to be moron to leave it eroding as fiat currency.  The best investment option (in terms of risk/reward) is supposed to be the stock market, or other forms of investing in private enterprise.  This is suboptimal for a whole host of reasons.  But the system is set up to systematically push people into the stock market by making it the option that's least ugly, potentially most profitable, yet still basically rational.  But now Bitcoin comes along enabling people to essentially beat the house.  Only there's a significant drawback -- money moves from investment to saving, en masse.  iPads don't magically create themselves...

I think it's a harder sell than you may imagine.  Internet people don't like stuff getting banned.  Let's see, you've got Redditors, Anonymous, the anti-SOPA/PIPA people, open source, and don't discount the growing base of Bitcoin fanatics.  Oh, and gamblers.  =)  
It certainly is a 1st amendment issue.  The Wordpress argument about allowing people from any nation to blog resonates.  Drugs are banned because there are real victims.  It's hard to find a "Bitcoin victim" to somehow showcase.  It's also hard to find a precedent for a technology getting outright banned.  Bottom line: the legislation would get bogged down.  Plenty of demonization, some regulation, but no outright ban.
And one more thing...  Export of strong crypto was banned.  Seems that's not a very relevant or effective ban today.
