Just because things happen at the same time does not mean they are related. A government shutdown and rise in crypto do not have to be related events.
I took a shit the size of a small dog from an all you can seafood buffet and Bitcoin went down a few ticks while I was on the toilet. Is the implication of these two closely timed events that if I decided to eat shellfish for the next three months I could crash the crypto market with the power of my anus?
Let me know, I'm genuinely curious.

Bitcoin market cap is going to be twice the size of Google?
In two weeks?
Any proof? Or are you just publicly FOMOing at the mouth.

No change. Why would an unregulated market need the government in any capacity?

I know basically every guy over the age of 50 pays good money for decent dick support.
I wonder if we don't hit McAfee's price target, he decides to stream himself eating a cake with his own face on it, confirming everyone's suspicion that he is a giant dick in and of himself. Sort of like how we found out in South Park that Bono was the World's biggest piece of shit.

Between the awful Game of Thrones posts, Tiananmen Square posts, and now this, I'm having trouble figuring out if these subreddits are the cringiest during bull or bear markets. And I feel like both sides are winning, and that makes everyone on these subs lose.
Gah. I need to take a shower.

In other news, all experts agree: The crypto markets will either go up or down considerably over the next several years.
