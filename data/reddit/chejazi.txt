Good detective work, I'm not sure who added it! I don't have more info to provide - I just happen to like checking tipboxes, as a proxy measurement of gratefulness.

A significant percentage of the currency hasn't been touched in years. Knowing whether these coins are spendable can only help adoption. Not knowing this information only adds risk.

I think privacy is important, and the transactions can happen without revealing identity.


This sounds like implicit trust to me.

Your argument is based on faith, which ironically Bitcoin was designed to eliminate as much as possible. I believe Satoshi created Bitcoin with good intentions, but what if something common like mental degradation (illness) were to happen? It doesn't have to be a crazy conspiracy to get us to a spot where Bitcoin could be in trouble. 
Knowing what money can move won't prevent bad things from happening, but will allow people to take more calculated approaches to embracing Bitcoin.

I'm honestly not sure whether professional investors know about the Satoshi coins. Many have claimed Bitcoin was over-invested in during the past few years (including Joi Ito) which makes me think they saw the technological brilliance, not the economics of digital cash.

So it's technically infeasible to do this with full fairness. I wonder if there's a "close-enough" strategy, e.g. a 5 year window.
I agree that I struggle with the ambiguity.

Could you elaborate on what is meant here?

You'll have to check your payout to get that answer!

So between 56k and 5.6M coins are spread across 5.6M addresses having 0.01-1... would like to see more precise data

Glad you like it! It was designed by me and my coworkers at StartupHouse in San Francisco.
We agree that there is value in simplicity. One of our core goals is to keep our site simple even as we add new features.

I will definitely check that out - thanks!
When requesting permissions, I'm a firm believer in only requesting what is needed :)

There's still an interstitial - but it's not so horrible :) 
Here's a Credhot example, going to Here's an AdFly example, going to the same page: 
Is the difference noticeable to you?
Edit: also yes to your other question! There is no 5 second wait.

Awesome! One of the simple measures I'm using is consolidated metrics by IP addresses. So no matter how many time you clicked that from a particular IP, you'd only get $.02. Using a botnet to generate fraudulent traffic would be interesting, although I imagine that would be a costly operation.
Definitely an important consideration - thanks for posting back!
