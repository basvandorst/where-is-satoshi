that may well be true from the bank's perspective. From the customer's perspective, it's the banks doing exactly what crpytocurrencies are supposed to 'save' them/us from: refusing them permission to use their own money as they see fit. Quite ironic really.

not even technically right. The (many various) blockchains are mirrored in thousands of locations all over the plannet. It would take some kind of mass-extinction-level event to wipe it all out, and need I point out that money will be the least of our problems in such a scenario?
And AUD/GBP/USD/CAD are NOT backed by something physical and valuable, they are backed predominantly by debt. Essentially by promises. That's not more tangible than ones and zeros...

I don't know - you haven't said which exchange it is. However (this is all speculation on my part) I suspect they might honour issues with small amounts - but if for example the whole exchange is hacked and everyone looses all their bitcoin, I'd be very surprised if everyone got it back. Then again I could be wrong.
Regardless, I hope you never have to find out :)

Setup a coinbase account, verify your bank account and send money as a transfer. It takes longer, but its' cheaper. If you live in Europe/UK you can use a Revolut account to reduce the exchange/transfer fees further. My workflow is like this:
1. Send £GBP (from bank = 0% fee, debit card = 0% fee or credit card 1% fee) to Revolut. 
2. Within revolut exchange £GBP &gt; €Euros (no fee, live exchange rate). 
3. Then send SEPA tranfer to Coinbase (no fee, takes anywhere from 2-72 hours depending on which side of the bed your aunts neighbours pet cat got up on that day).
4. Send €EUROS from Coinbase to GDAX (same login details).
5. Buy BTC/LTC/ETH on the market at GDAX &gt; very low fee 0.25% or sometimes less.
6. transfer crypto to your own wallet. &gt; free (I think coinbase even pay the transaction fee but not 100% sure on that).
Some steps can be omitted if you are funding directly from $USD or €EUROS...
If I'm in a hurry (ie bitcoin is 'crashing' and I want to buy the dip, or I'm trying to fund an ICO that is about to close) I will fund coinbase direct with my debit or credit card and take the hit of the higher fees...

I did that off the top of my head and I did think as I was writing "I should check this because maybe 12 months isn't enough". But I didn't check and I was wrong. Fair enough. If you extend that period to roughly 24 months it's pretty much a truth (I'm not going to scrutinise the entire history but it's more or less correct). The point is that in the long term it's always gone up. That may not continue for ever of course.

Nice. I'm a woodworker too. I've only just jumped into bitcoin a couple of weeks ago but I would certainly accept it as payment for my work. However I have to point out that while the fees aren't such an issue for higher amounts, for anythong under a couple of hundred FIATs (I'm on £GBP) it's pretty high fees. And since bitcoin is supposed to be a digital cash - ANY fee  that's not fractions of pennies is high, because when have you ever had to pay a fee for using actual cash?

@_date: 2017-11-12 20:34:22
Revolut is seen as a bank by the exchanges - they (revolut) froze my second payment while they verified it with me, but after that all has been fine. If your main bank is in Euros anyway, you may as well not bother with revolut (I hadn't heard of it until a couple of weeks ago) but your bank may charge a small fee (about €10) for the transfer. It's still cheaper with revolut.
Revolut effectively gives you a bank account, with sort code, account number, IBAN number etc - and if you hold different currencies with them you get a different set of account details for each one, and you can transfer/exchange between them with no fee at the actual exchange rate. It's all quite impressive.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:27:58
Look at it this way, if it hadn't dipped, it would probably be well on it's way to $10k by now so you'd have missed out on even more gains... at least the dip held it back for a bit even if you missed the dip itself.

@_date: 2017-11-20 21:08:20
yeah credit card purchases are expensive. I'm in the UK so it's even more convoluted as coinbase won't take £GBP directly (I have to convert to €EURO), BUT I've ended up getting a Revolut account, P make credit card payments to that (only 1% fee), then send that as SEPA transfer (it's a European thing)  to Coinbase for no fee at all. From there I send it to GDAX, buy my coins and then send to wallet.
My first two purchases were direct debit and credit card purchases on coinbase and cost me 8% 
now with the above I pay only 1% or 0% if funding direct from bank or debit card.
The downside is it's slower, and because I initiated a transfer on the friday before the dip to $5500, I missed the dip as it took until monday afternoon to clear. Had I paid the 8% fee and paid by CC I would have caught the dip and the fee would have vanished when it climbed 50% over the following days.

I'm a newbie. I started looking into bitcoin seriously about a month ago, have spent far too many hours reading up about it and watching videos. on 25th Oct I bought a small amount of bitcoin to get my feet wet and stored it "in" this wallet on my iPhone. Now I don't have any BCH because I didn't buy any bitcoin before October, and I was lucky that I downloaded this app BEFORE they made this change, but I saw the update on the app store yesterday and notice that new default behavior and it is very concerning as there is already so much confusing information for newbies.
As I said, for me I was lucky with the timing and I've read enough about all the forks etc to be aware of these sorts of things, and to check before I do any big transactions, but I shouldn't have to. I actually transferred a fairly large amount of BTC from Coinbase (having trading it from EUR on GDAX in the last few days) to my address which is in this wallet. Had that been my first purchase/transaction and I'd downloaded the new version of the app, things could have gone very differently.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:52:38
I still think it might go down a bit more before it goes up again. Historically after each big run it’s dropped to around 2x what it was before the RUNUP, which in this case would mean around $3k. I don’t think it will to that low but could still drop a bit from where it is....
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:17:30
it's difficult to even respond to that. I hope that one day not too far into the future Bitcoin/blockchain technology will help to make this sort of thing history.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:52:47
at coinbase you pay an exchange fee to buy the bitcoin. What people are discussing here is the transaction fees to send bitcoin within the bitcoin network. If you move your bitcoins from coinbase to your own wallet (or to someone else), that's when you pay your first bitcoin transaction fee. 
You can mitigate the coinbase purchase fees by doing a bank transfer instead of a card payment.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:11:13
probably true. Then again I've had some for a week or so and I'm not selling. I'm hoping it's going to drop a lot more so I can buy more cheaper, but if it goes back up in a few days I will still buy more anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:06:55
you can fund your revolut account with debit or credit card, you end up paying much lower fees that way.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:53:57
that's a good point, but the thing is it needs more adoption for it to become genuinely useful as a currency (it also needs the transaction fees and delays issues sorting out, but that will happen). As more people adopt it, it will start to be used more and more directly as a currency. It won't happen overnight, and dollar (or perhaps more accurately, FIAT, as the dollar may be doomed and on it's way out as China rises) will be king for a good while longer yet, but as (if) more and more people buy bitcoin, regardless of their intentions, it will become more and more useful. At some point it will become mainstream at least as an alternative currency, and at that point those who bought early will be glad they did, because to them at that point it will be very valuable AND useful in it's own right.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:15:29
I've studied the charts way back to 2010. Granted we can't predict the future from the past with certainty, but historically, everytime it hits an ATH, it then corrects and drops to around 2-3x what it was BEFORE the run up to the ATH. Then it stabalises, and rises again to repeat at 5-10x it's current value. It's literally done that every year or so for the last 7 years, with the overall effect that on average it's doubled in price every 4.4 months or so. I'm willing to bet on it continuing to do that for the next 5 years or so at least.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:27:29
I actually bought bitcoin (+ETH+LTC) against 20-month 0% interested credit card this month. In principal it seems reckless, but at this point it seems like a no-brainer to me. Already "made back" 21% within this month.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:49:18
Currently no, they don't. They say they are working on it. You can still do a bank transfer from a GBP account, but you have to pay your bank's transfer fee AND their exchange rate conversion fee so the tranaction is in Euros (I guess you could do USD instead but that would cost even more and be even slower). It's much cheaper and quicker with Revolut.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:22:00
Just don't put it in your own wallet yet until the fees go down, or you'll lose most, if not all of that to the transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:10:08
yeah that's fair enough, just wanted to make it clear how it works. I totally agree, I'm in this for long term as well so over time the fees will be insignificant anyway, but I still don't like to pay them if I can avoid it :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:14:07
I'm in a similar boat to you guys. I bought my first £115 worth of bitocion two weeks ago just to get used to the whole buying process. I then bought another £500 last week, and I deposited another £1000 on friday evening to Coinbase - however that hasn't cleared yet and I guess it will go through tomorrow.
Two points to answer 's questions:
1. once your Euros reach the exchange, you then convert them to bitcoin at the live rate at that time. It happens pretty much instantly - it's only the transfer from your bank to the exchange that takes a while.
2. Which exchange are you using? I used coinbase for my first transfer, but I paid for it by credit card and the fees were high - around 8% in total. I since found out the best way is to do the following:
Sign up for a Revolut account (all done through the app on your phone - no it's not a scam). Transfer money from your FIAT account to your revolut account (the account is setup within minutes). In my case I earn in £GBP, so once I have that in revolut (which you can do from your bank account, debit card or credit car. There is a 1% charge for credit card topups which is MUCH lower than the coinbase credit card charge).
Then within Revolut, convert your local currency to EUROS (unless you already started with Euros). Then make the transfer from Revolut to your exchange's bank account - being sure you put the REFERENCE CODE they give you, otherwise the funds will float around and not reach your account on the exchange. Revolut do not charge a fee for the EURO transfer.
If you are using coinbase, then go to GDAX and login to there using your coinbase credentials (it's the same company, but GDAX has lower fees for the next step, for some reason). On coinbase, find the EUR/BTC trading pair, and add funds - there is a tab to use the funds that are in your coinbase account. Convert those to bitoin (or ETH or LTC if you prefer). There is no conversion fee for that last step if you do it on GDAX, whereas if you do it on coinbase there is a fee of a around 1.5% I think.
Then you should transfer your BITCOIN(/ETH/LTC) to your own wallet, (unless you plan on trading it). There is a transaction fee for this within the bitcoin network - the fees are very high at the moment (relatively). They are a fixed amount, currently averaging around $10 I think so if you're only doing small amounts it's pretty painful.
I hope that helps. I've literally gone through all this in the last couple of weeks as an absolute newcomer to crypto coins myself and it's been a steep learning curve. The above is the cheapest way to get £GBP or €EUR into BITCOIN.

Bitcoin transaction fees are not dependant on the transaction value, but rather the weight in bits (it's technical, but although it various over time, it is not a percentage-based fee).
FIAT to BITCOIN fees depend on the exchange you are using and can be anything from &lt;1% to ~15% depending on which exchange you use and what method of payment you choose (again see my reply to your earlier comment above for more detail).
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:24:14

and anyway, what relevance will it have in ten years? maybe they cashed out when it got to $10k. Maybe the panicked and sold it all off when it dropped to $4k next week (before it climbed up past $10k ;). 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:18:44
I was messing. Obviously three years ago would have been ideal, or 6 years even. But I've only seriously started looking into bitcoin the last month or so, and only bought my first $150 dollars worth a couple of weeks ago. Just bought another $600 worth a few days ago. I'm hoping to get around 1.0 bitcoins worth by the end of the year, and if it keeps dropping like this for a few days I may just about manage! I'm thinking it might go down as low as $4000, so I'm keeping and eye on it and hoping to buy in around that price, but if it starts climbing back up past $7000 tomorrow I would buy. If it continues to drop I will try to buy as low as possible.
That's my plan. You'll have to decide what works for you, but I definitely don't think it's too late. It's just a matter of trying to get the timing right on this dip, but I would't worry too much if that doesn't seem to work out. Buy and hold - that's my basic strategy.

@_date: 2017-11-22 21:56:17
It is convoluted to be honest, but it keeps the fees down as close to zero as possible. In theory you could use gdax directly but since I didn't know about them when I got the oinbase account, I started using only coinbase. Sine gdax is the same company you can login with your coinbase credentials. The account details for GDAX is the exact same bank account as coinbase, they just use a different reference, but when I tried that in order to transfer funds directly into gdax, it still ended up in my coinbase account. 
From there moving it to gdax is simple, free and instant. Then you buy your crypto using a market order, and move it from Gdax to your own crypto wallet address. (I strongly advise against keeping any crypto on any exchange that isn't active in a trade -always withdraw to your own wallet as soon as the trading is done). 
I also just discovered that sending bitcoin from coinbase, they make you pay the [bitcoin network] transaction fee, whereas GDAX apparently don't, so that's another way to save on fees, particularly significant for smaller amounts. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:48:02

@_date: 2017-11-16 11:24:10
exactly. I know we can't look at the past performance and simply extrapolate to future performance, but for sake of argument if we do that based on performance over the last 24 months, then a (€/$/£)5000 investment now will be worth 2.5 million in 5 years, and that includes withdrawing the initial investment after 20 months.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:11:16

It makes sense - even if/when you start paying interest on a CC/loan - even if that is 28% APR, bitcoin is averaging 11.8% PER MONTH over the last two years. So you're earning  around 10x more with the bitcoin gains than you'd pay in interest.
Unless bitcoin falls apart, it makes sense. In which case - default on the loan, help the demise of FIAT and bitcoin bounces back. hehehe. (Ok I know that is oversimplified but it makes me smile none the less).
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:15:41
Yes and no. They accept GBP card transactions, but they don’t have a GBP bank account currently so transfers have to be in Euro or USD, and it is cheaper and possibly quicker to take the Euro option. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:13:17
well, it's risky in that you still have to pay it back later weather it goes up or not. In theory at least....
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:47:46
I disagree with that. To me it seems they are two sides of the coin (excuse the pun). Spending of bitcoin itself doesn't increase its's value vs ($USD / €EUR etc), but if lots of people are making transactions with it then that does increase it's practical value as more and more people use it in that way. HOLDING it increases it's value VS (FIAT) (because there is high demand but less supply) but decreases it's practical value because there's less in circulation, and therefore it's not as useful.

The internet seemed complicated to the masses at first, but now everyone uses it as part of everyday life in multiple ways. I think you're right though, bitcoin might not be the one to take hold for everyday uses by the masses, but it's very likely some kind of blockchain technology will.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:19:52
well, right now I am waiting for a €EUR transfer to hit my coinbase account, which I will then convert to bitcoin and transfer to bittrex to trade altcoins. At least, that's what I did two weeks ago. With bitcoin  transaction fees at around $10 now (and delays on confirmations), I will instead convert to LTC or ETH before I transfer from coinbase to bittrex. So yeah if something doesn't change with the BTC fees, I think that trend will decrease a lot.

there's still some room for growth, but it will start slowing in a few months I thnk. unles see rapid hyperinfation of fiat, there's only so far bitcoin's market cap can grow unless it takes over all other fiat currencies and dominates. IF that happens, it's going to take more than 18 months...

yeah, I mean I guesstimated the percentages, and I buy in £GBP/€Euros, but you just add up the total USD value of all your crypto holdings, then divide the amount of an individual holding by the total and multiply x 100 to get the percentage of the total.
Or get the Blocflio app, enter all your holdings and it will automatically track your porrfilio size, percentage by coin, overall growth etc.

The issue is not about losing private keys by accident/incompetence. It's about the exchange (or in this case cobinhood if you want to be pedantic and say they are not an exchange) being hacked, or a rogue employee/s stealing private keys/funds. The hacking issue becomes a bigger problem the bigger the platform is - because the reward for the successful hacker is appreciably bigger. Hacks (or claimed hacks that may be inside jobs) to crypto exchanges happen every year, usually multiple cases each year. There have already been at least two cases this year that I know of.

bitcoin[et al] is to mastercard what napster/MP3 was to the music industry. If mastercard don't buck up and embrace real blockchain technology they will be left in the dust eventually and consigned to the history books...

If it’s ever going to become useful on a widespread scale, it doesn’t matter. Those who hold it, weather to use it, or to cash out riches later, will at some point find they don’t need to cash out and can just use it instead.

yeah but anyone can do that. The younger generation will have a lot less of a mental hurdle understanding and embracing cryptocurrency than the older ones.

In fairness, CNBC and any other MS news channel don't give a shit what's really happening, the only care about sensationalising everything to pull the viewers in.

What an utterly terribly written article. It seems to be directed at ‘newbies’. I would advise all newbies to steer well clear of this article. 
It’s basic premises are fine, but it’s written so badly that anyone new to all this won’t get anything worthwhile from reading it at all. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:17:41
hahahahaha you got me! that’s a good one.

bitcoin, yes. £ &gt; € NO! what's happened is they printed "£1 buys €1.4083" but they meant "£1 buys $1.4083)
