To think?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:30:19
The squeaky wheel get the grease.  I feel like we are being too defensive of bitcoins flaws instead of directly addressing them.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:45:09
Am I a monkey?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:58:06
No idea at all...no reason was given.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:03:50
I agree that these things are being worked on.  However,  there needs to be some urgency to those tasks so that bitcoin does not get replaced. For now I am all out of ideas.  Perhaps there is some way for me to become involved beyond mining...
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:42:28
Why do you say its become centralized? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:12:08
Around $2000 some of that due to coinbase locking my account.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:19:22
no this is where I wanted to post.

@_date: 2017-12-21 03:35:14
Yeah I know this is probably an echo chamber but I dont fear downvotes so I figured I would speak my mind.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:48:10
Thats fair but what about the companies that are doing well because of the increased hardware sales?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:54:43
Am I a bacteria? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:26:56
Yeah I know that sucks nuts.  I was wondering why they froze it and this makes sense...I am fucked. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:03:46
That is what I am doing.  Speaking my opinion on how bitcoin is working for me.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:57:15


This was my premise and you confirmed yourself that it was indeed correct.  I am not concern trolling at all but stating the current state of affairs. Bitcoin is not meeting its users needs and that is not trolling it is awareness of the problems we are facing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:51:38
Good luck to you as well.  I am going to give it a day or two more to consolidate then I will get back in.  I think that the bitcoin cash move has pulled away enough buyers to drop us a little more.  In the end I will probably gain some fraction of a bitcoin which will make me happy.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:54:51
Do these contracts actually involve the exchange of bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:40:05
Its a semantic argument over the meaning of what something is.  If something evolves it it a new thing or not?

Its a figure of speech that is often used when people talk about investing.  Sure its a bit colloquial but this was meant to be a casual conversation.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:57:29
I personally do not want the price to get ahead of the tech.  I am afraid the the perception of bitcoin will be long term negatively affected by massive market selloffs. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:14:46
Its about dismissing the premise without addressing it, not how thin my skin is.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:00:41


I am really tired so please explain this too me I am not sure what it means.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:00:54
How is this guy relevant? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:32:39
Until bitcoin is stable again USD, I was simply losing too much sleep over my loses.  I cant even send my mining earnings over the network anymore.  I simply do not make enough.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:38:35
This guy is a conman. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:32:15
This is what I was thinking as well, its not the size of the crash but the psychology behind it.  The "It could happen to me, the stock market might be a bubble as well."  It will be interesting to see if it happens.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:23:55
Hubris. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:36:16
I wish I could buy but I am all in cash at the moment since coinbase has restricted my account for no reason....
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:28:26
I really hope this works but we need to be a little bit squeakier as a community. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:13:07
Well I hope you are right but I believe you are wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:33:10
I had been hodling for about 6 months and got nervous and took and out and coinbase locked me out...sucked because bitcoin skyrocketed....then I got back in and it sinks 20%
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:58:07
Are you a monkey and a bacteria and human?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:21:35
My funds are locked in coinbase they have decided to restrict my account for no apparent reason.  Cant buy shit. Would love to though.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:40:16
Right as I was about to pull the trigger on my first ever day trading win coinbase restricted my account...fuck.  Good for you though congrats!
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:29:07
Calling me a troll is ad hominem attack and a classic way to not have to deal with the actual problem.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:52
First I love bitcoin and digital currencies.  Having, said that there are a lot of flaws that need to be addressed.  We are seeing a pull back on fundamentals not on lack of support or hope for the coin.  Bitcoin needs to adapt to the world that wants to have it.  If it does not some other crypto will take over where bitcoin has failed.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:38:16
Thats fair it does seem that major investors are on the sidelines. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:28:05
I being purposely overly dramatic because it could in fact die if we dont actively support it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:07:53
I too think bitcoin has tons of potential and do not want to see if fail.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:15:14
Thanks.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:12:31
As I said in another comment I think the recession would more than likely be physiologically driven rather than technically driven.  I hope we never see it but people are sometimes panicky.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:10:15
Ok is bitcoin cash still bitcoin?  It is just an evolution right?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:54:02
1. Transaction fees must go down significantly
2. Speeds of transaction must increase
3. The speed of new technology adoption must increase
4. The end user determines the value of bitcoin not the miners, focus on the end user.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:49:25
I was pretty sure I was going to ruffle some feathers.  Just hoping it snaps some of us out of the pointing fingers stage....
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:14:00
Ok but by forking you mean they just added some features to it right?  Which made it different from the original bitcoin?  Thus when something evolves and becomes different it becomes something new.
@_date: 2014-10-20 03:42:25
Seems like we need to stop trusting exchanges.  Can someone create an exchange where we don't have to store coins in it?  Were trades are just processed through them? 
@_date: 2014-11-27 07:30:21
Skepticism is fine.  I guess that time will tell.  Also I see people post negative stuff all the time on hashtalk so you are wrong there.  Who in there right mind would want to come in here and be abused by harsh questions?  
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:44:44
I mean if you were buying on the speculation that prices would go up, you had to realize that was just speculative buying right?  Bitcoin will become naturally superior to normal money as the technology matures.
@_date: 2017-09-13 07:21:13
China may have been the catalyst for selling but the bubble was built on speculation of future prices and was primed to burst.  I mean China really hates freedom why wouldn't they use this opportunity to crush the freedoms brought by Bitcoin.  I have personally believe bitcoin will be worth more than $5000 dollars at some point in the future but we are far from that now.
Edit: Sorry its normal for a speculative bubble to burst.
@_date: 2017-09-13 07:50:16
I agree that ICOs are driving up bitcoins price and are part of the speculative bubble.  Certainly I could be wrong and misreading the factors that I am taking into account but to me at the moment I believe a 20%+ correction will continue.  In the end I will channel Warren Buffet if every one is buying you should sell and if everyone is selling you should by.  Corrections create GREAT buying opportunities in the end.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:06:01
I agree cryptos long term value is much higher than now but we are overvalued at the moment relative to demand.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:34:38
Cool did not know about this thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:34:47
Maybe we need to move to the Bitcoin standard...Seems like gold has always increased in value relative to fiat.  Huh, what do you know it looks a lot like bitcoins charts now days.
