I would take some of that out  for profit. Minimize your risk. Coins are very cheap right now. Say you invested 150 k back into the market and took 150 for profit. That 150 k profit invested in the right coins will make you a multi  millionaire in a year  that’s conservative I my opinion. Don’t be the guy that lost all his money in the crypto market because he didn’t take profit. Don’t be that guy that took everything out of the crypto  market and lost millions in profit.  Cover both ends.

You know the problem. Now find the solution. Don’t let yourself be susceptible to these situations.

as a person who got into cryptos in June i would highly recommend technical analysis for the financial markets by murphy. When you day trade you need to have the knowledge to do so, never trade on someone elses que. its sets a tone for bad habits.

A tool that might come in handy is using coinigy and looking at the buy and sell walls. They change all the time but it helps

I sold my bitcoin into USDT. If you haven’t heard of it, it’s basically the crypto dollar. It stays at 1 dollar and might go up or down a couple cents. The transaction for it didn’t take long at all. So say I was there when BTC went to 6500 I would have bought BTC with USDT. And when it hits 8k I would sell it right back into USDT and then wait for the next dip. 
Not sure what you meant in the second half of your question.

Thanks for the reply and I agree with you but I am referring to before the fork. I’m pretty sure it will hit 8 or 9 k before the fork. And as of now my question is, 
Will there be a deeper correction before it climbs past 7300 or even 7k looking at the charts it doesn’t seem like it wants to climb again unless there is a healthier correction

Yep. I knew it when I saw cern, and when white rose showed them her parents I assume.

Some of it has to do with ideals. Lots of people are bullish on crypto because the entire system is corrupt. Especially fiat.  It’s a gamble. If you stick it out good chance you will be very happy. However they could make it illegal but I doubt they will. Look what’s happening around the world. The petro dollar this the USD is in serious trouble because the BRICS alliance and petro yuan. My advise is to invest in gold as well as crypto. Especially utility tokens

Wait till poloniex (soon to be biggest western crypto exchange) starts fiat pairing.  If the elite decide to take it bitcoin this is how.

Tron is decentralized entertainment. The artist has ownership rights and gets paid directly. Also m, they partnered with a couple gaming companies. I suspect you will get paid money for certain digital gaming assets and be able to sell them. Perhaps you unlock a achievement in a  game and your reward is some tron. The main net comes out this year and beta will come soon. Right now it’s speculative like 90 percent of crypto. It’s a legit company but it’s also brand new. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 07:25:07
Diversify bro. Unless you know without a shadow of a doubt tron will be your best investment.

Right now perhaps. At least the amount is finite, borderless, non discriminatory traceable and immutable. 
Fiat has none of that.  
Crypto/blockchain is the new world order. It will either liberate humanity or consolidate more power into the few and powerful.

Maybe that time traveler was right and to have just one bitcoin in the future will make you extremely rich. People will be hunted down down for their secret keys. Nations with the most bitcoin will have the most power. While everybody else will fight tooth and nail for a handful of satoshies.

It’s high risk high reward in my opinion. Has lots to prove but the idea has big potential if achieved. Long term hold no doubt.

I know. But Foxconn invested a lot of money into elastos. Could be something in the works.  Perhaps elastos will run on the phone. Foxconn makes certain parts for apple and other big companies and is one of the largest on the world.
