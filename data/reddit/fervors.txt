Dude who cares if you made money or he lost. Stop going around a speculative board, being condescending to people simply speculating.. Literally no reason being a know-it-all cunt the second the numbers are in your favor :-)!
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:04:51
Why are you running around threads being so mad dude... Did you buy at 19k...?
Its a speculative asset by nature, let people speculate, instead of being a 20/20 hindsight edgy teen.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:28:47
Which are speculative assets...
Also the whole currency-part is an idea given by some part of the userbase, for some of us it could simply be a decentralized store of wealth, which is preferable to fucking banks

Honestly i would rather they sell their holding out to their people, than them hodling it :) Will create an even greater holding base and even higher transaction numbers.

No we haven't, we have jus started getting to the institutional money, wall street has hardly even joined. Join before they do or miss the real spike.

Saw it hit 13.9, now its 15k again. Dont ever doubt the dips, buy them!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:37:40
BCH just dropped 45%...
BTC at 28%...
We are just ridding ourselves of the cancer BCH is and then we are getting back on track to the moon.

What are you talking about, i am defending bitcoin, you are so new it hurts..

Sell now when they are topping. Buy Bitcoin/Eth/Lite, get out of the scamcoin asap.

Everyone getting their salary in a week.. I sure as shit will keep pumping a few percent of my monthly salary into cryptoes, its like capping an extra 10% on your paycheck for the last year.

Why are edgy libertarians trying to claim the crypto-movement :-)?

I know that not a single dip has survived for 3 months.

Mainly Ethereum, but yeah, he is a long time hodler and investor. But he isn't a nobody, he is one of the early guys in the coin. Anyway, any single news your hear is speculative, take this guy as serious as you would any other.

Which is why its not quite dead yet. Goldman Sachs always makes paper.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:30:36
You are number 100 that asks the same conspiracy-ish question today.
As none of us know, and you are (probably) invested in Bitcoin, why not try to spread hope that they are going long (which is what everyone presumed when futures-implementation was announced) as the probability for both is equal (in it being unknown). Stop thinking of big banks and Wall Street as one evil clumped hivemind/entity. It can go both ways. What is almost certain is that this implementation will increase volume by a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:01:32
You are getting this all wrong... Sure there are Bitcoin Millionaires, who are only millionaires because of their current holdings, but a lot of people use the expression of people who ARE already on paper millionaires in dollar (and probably still bitcoin) who got their wealth THROUGH bitcoins initially, thus 'bitcoin millionaires'. A simple observant title..
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:44:06
So you are saying its a bubble because:
A: Its not a bubble
B: Its a bubble

r/bitcoin wont let you make a text post without an url anymore due to FUD
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:54:17
People have the opposite action as well, to go long, and Bitcoin is gathering mass attention, millions have jsut joined the exchanges with investments, i highly doubt the mainstream investor will want to see this go down..?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:44:36
This logic is supposed to be applied to a stock you have great confidence in, not just the entire stock market in general :-) 
Buffet isnt (yet) sold on the idea of Bitcoin, being a very oldschool coca cola shill :)

You can buy dollars with it cant ya..
Anywho i don't think it proves your point at all, 'we' use "Bitcoin Millionaire" simply as a title to describe how that million (dollars if you will) were made.
Go look up what "Fiat currency" means. Here i will quote wiki for you: "Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value established as money by government regulation. It has an assigned value only because the government uses its power to enforce the value of a fiat currency."
If you are saying it cant have intrinsic value, like a fiat currency, well, eh. It certainly has the inherent probability to do once. The dollar value has been on a steady decline all your life, stores are rapidly accepting Bitcoin, the shift is maybe not certain, but definitely not impossible.

This is good for Bitcoin.

Microsoft through Xbox,
Mass amounts of Etsy, Pinterest, Ebay and lately Craiglist private dealers.
A lot more, but i think some of those are relevant retailers...
Sure Steam disabled it for now, but accepts other cryptos with, probably until Lightning is implemented.
Try again

Why did you ever join Bitcoin, if you have doubts its a scam now...
Try to reverse the logic, what if "they" (these unknown scammers you fools are going on about) instead wanted to go long in Bitocin, which theoretically can be massively more profitable than a shorting EVER could be.
See its very easy to make conspiracytheories, i dont get why people are scared of the negatives of the futures implementation, when THEORETICALLY, it could also be the beginning of a mass longing and pumping.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:39:13
Just like the dollar has lost 75% of its worth in your lifetime...?

What the fuck kinda question is that, none of us are fortune tellers buddyboy ;)
Buy, sell or hodl. This is mainly speculative, sure some news can pump it up or down, but.. How would anyone know.

Why would 5 of the biggest financial institutions prepare Bitcoin ETF and trading desks, if they did not expect to gain money from it? They are about one thing, money, fucking everything over in the meanwhile is collateral. But for now, Sachs, CME, BoA is looking to make money, which is why this is not yet the end.
