That evidence I might be able to grant a little more credit, but it is still not guaranteed to be related to the available market for goods and services.  People want in for other reasons.  It could just as easily be speculation driving the price; it sure as heck was for me.  I appreciated the logic you are leaning on now from the moment I first bought, but as of now I just can't discount all the things I think could go wrong.  I liquidated most of my position out of fear and skepticism, I pocketed some walking around money in a denomination that I have greater confidence in, and now I just watch from the sidelines trying not to trap myself in a pit of despair when the price doubles.  It's pretty easy, because I constantly keep in mind what you say: retrospect is 20/20.
Anyway, we'll see on June 2nd.  The BTC I did feel was worth keeping in risk will hopefully be worth 20x what I paid for it by then.

I stand corrected then.

The same way you would acquire any non-virtual currency:  sell a good or service to someone who is paying in Bitcoin.  That is a pretty limited subset when compared to the dollar market, but it is growing every day. 
Now if you're wondering if the Dollar and Bitcoin will ever de-link, well, that answer could be a book on its own.

True. That was the fault in my thinking.

I suppose I am, so let me rephrase to clarify what I am getting at.  If you took all the stuff available to be traded for Bitcoin in the entire world at this very moment and put it in a big pile and put a price on it, what would it be worth?  I don't think its value equivalent to a 800 years worth of Silk Road sales, and it is arguable that it is worth 130.

No, what's happened over the past 5 minutes is what a publicly traded stock in a company looks like the morning after an earnings report beat estimates: immediate gap up at open.  Because bitcoin exchanges markets are up 24/7 and available worldwide, we're seeing it in real time.  The previous day and first half hour of this hearing was a mix of bubble with a textbook case of "buy the rumor, sell the news."  The thing is the news appears to be good enough that it has engendered enough enthusiasm to outweigh the cold calculus of any opportunists.

I highly doubt and challenge your assertion that $10bil of the market is captured by Bitcoin.  Silk Road is probably the biggest market out there, and they do ~$12million in transactions a year from what I can tell on Wikipedia.  Are there 130 other Silk Roads worth of goods and services being bought with Bitcoin that would support a $140 price? ($12mil * 130 = $140x11.5mil BTC in circulation)  Are there 800+ Silk Roads worth as you assert?  I can't track down a hard citation, and I imagine the international and decentralized nature of the currency makes it impossible to tell.

"He/she" was me, and I acknowledged that mistake.  I imagine at the rate you are replying to people, you are replying from the inbox which doesn't initially show full context, so I can excuse the mixup.  
I will just reboil what I call our debate down to this:  There are 60 trillion USD worth of market out there.  You say 10 billion USD of that is trading in Bitcoin now, giving a true valuation of Bitcoin equalling 917 USD.  I think the estimation of 10 billion is extremely optimistic, and I don't even know if 1 billion conservative enough.  Since there is likely 0 verifiable evidence available to back either of our claims, there is no way for either of us to be objectively correct.  
I will add on to that now that since there is no way for either of us to be correct, no objective statements should be made about the correct price of Bitcoin, and extreme skepticism should be exercised concerning that price, whether it is on your original post, in the dreams of wanna-be Bitcoin billionaires, from the infinite skeptics saying it is worthless, or even on the ticker right this second at Mt. Gox.  There are an infinity of variables unaccounted for, some in action right this moment, and some waiting in the wings.  A lot of people are expressing a lot of optimism and enthusiasm regarding your analysis and my goal is to give them a second, contrary opinion to think about as well.  I don't think I am off-base in doing so.

$60 trillion is the number Bitcoin supporters want it to be. It is not the number it is.  There are a X reasons it will be and X reasons it will never be.  I do not disagree with you that the potential value is way up there, pie in the sky.  The reality though is that there is currently a low rate of adoption, a lack of liquidity stemming from the technical difficulties of getting involved, and several mitigating risks such as the lack of the centralized regulation that average people rely on, theft and incompetency leading to permanent loss, and the competition from other services that deal in other currencies.  God only knows if Bitcoin blows through those walls and reaches its potential, and I sure wish I did.

Thanks for saying it.  I get frustrated that others here treat this event as if it were some sort of normal, and that the outcome is predictable.  There is what seems like a deliberate at manipulation going on considering the huge number of 0.02BTC transactions being posted to the order book on both sides.  There could just as easily be a manipulation in common thought about these events by having them occur every week like clockwork.  All it takes is one that doesn't turn out "as predicted" for things to get ugly.

Trying to associate Bitcoin with that old campaign seems counter-intuitive to me since a credit card is not actually money.  The trick of the old ad was to use a new, unfamiliar technology to influence people into going into debt when making relatively minor purchases.  Using debt as purchasing power seems to be the very idea that so many Bitcoin enthusiasts rail against when they use "Bernanke" and "The Fed" as slurs.

I agree they are great at customer service...security on the other hand leaves a lot to be desired.  Account passwords are alphanumeric 6-8 characters.  That's it.  A PC could brute-force that in 15 seconds.
They do offer a proprietary 2FA at least.

The price was going up regularly for months, and volume dropped precipitously as the price stabilized around ~47-48.  That usually means the market is trying to figure out what happens next.   I would probably say today's upward move indicates a new price floor, but there is some pretty extraordinary news out of Cyprus that must be driving it.  So long story short, yeah still scary.
This is my first post here, so in case anyone cares:  I'm waiting for funds to clear with an exchange so I can buy my first Bitcoins.  I figure that this stabilizing online currency is a good hybrid between a speculative investment and emergency store of value in case government-issued money gets ugly in the near future.  I don't have use for it yet as a payment method, since getting in and out of it is so illiquid (compared to just using my Mastercard at least), but I hope it gets there.

There's a checkbox to make a "market order."  If that is unchecked, your bid will go up and be filled by either matching asks or simply people making market orders to sell on the other side.  In that case you wouldn't experience a price difference.  A market order on the other hand would just buy through whatever asks are posted for whatever prices you happen to get, likely progressively higher.
At least I think that's how it works.

Looking at the log scale of the whole price history, I see exactly what you mean.  The thing I learned right away is that the meteoric rise in 2011 was slightly more rapid than what is going on now, and that is definitely not immediately apparent from the linear scale.  Another interesting pull is that the rate of change from 20 to 50 in early 2013 also very closely mirrors the change from 2 to 5 in early 2012.  The price shot up another ~70% to ~$8.50 from there and took a ~40% correction to ~$5. Both that and the 2011 crash gives some insight into where we might go in the current event.
Thanks for the response; I abandon my previous position.

What reasons would you say so?  My argument against is that asset prices do not typically increase by orders of magnitude in linear time except in a few extraordinary cases.  Using a log-scale contrasts it too greatly from most common graphical expression of such relationships and greatly reduces the chance of immediate understanding.  It also would suppress the idea that this is an extraordinary case, which it clearly is. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:22:11
Agreed. I'd like to see the left half cut off so it stand on its own.
