I appreciate your response. I imagine that tweaking an existing product can make them a little nervous. Justifiably so.

BC could have been a major (if not the top) contender in bitcoin tipping/micropayments by now.
This why its important to not only have a team developing new software when you get funding, but to also roll out fixes for the old software as it continues to be used.

omg, that screenshot though...

Its pretty obvious its Andreas Antonopoulos after his Canadian Senate Hearing Participation.
Plenty of people are important to bitcoin and definitely deserve honorable mentions, but that hearing was pretty great.
@_date: 2014-11-16 01:23:29
Nope, but nice try. Its much simpler without all the weird banter I just read.
Counterparty forked ethereum, which was awesome, took a tone as if it made ethereum no longer relevant.... which is not awesome...
Ethereum spends half a day rewriting counterparty.... in 300ish lines of code...
Checkmate Bitch...
Hows that fit into your weird little, over imagined sexual fantasies above?

Things may seem a bit complicated until you see how easy some of the things being developed, really are.
I like your idea about the username/address.

What some are just now starting to think about, others have already been working on... Here is a demo video before launch but this is just the tip of the iceberg.
This needed to be created first in order for an even larger project.

Im sorry to hear that. I would like to personally be more involved. Im not sure if that is a good or bad thing, but if it results in some normalcy then maybe it helps bitcoin in some way.
I read all of the time, but it has gotten pretty bad over the last few days, or at least it has stood out to me as being that way recently.
@_date: 2014-12-20 21:23:13
Im sure these types of decisions will be worked out once reddcoin/socialx/redd-id gets closer to an actual launch.
Our community is (at this moment) comprised mostly of people who have joined reddcoin through research. In fact one of the things that attracted me to it in the first place is that you pretty much have to enjoy reading, in order to love the idea (Although more easily digestible info exists now than when I first became a fan).
Its a good community, with good people and I can see thoughtful decisions being made. We have a lot to figure out still, even as a community, but we are getting there.

Considering that the writer of the "article" had to be corrected on the fact that Paycoin will use a separate blockchain from Bitcoin... Id say almost no research was done for that blog post.
This coin is pure hype, and bad hype at that. When a comment on hashtalk forums get an upvote, they receive hashpoints. Hashpoints are deducted for downvotes.

I told a family member about bitcoin, he seemed excited about it. Over the next few days he sent me a bunch of articles and reasons to not buy it...
Then proceeded to "explain" bitcoin to me when I visited him lol. At that point I just decided to let bitcoin do what bitcoin does best and observe how he feels about it over time.
... I figure right about the time BTC becomes too expensive for the average person to own a full coin, he will tell me all the reasons why he decided to get involved... lol
Sometimes you gotta just let people be who they are. Some find reasons why they should try something new, some find reasons and excuses why they should just stay in their comfort zone their entire lives.

Arent you the guy who put out the fake "Cryptsy Hacked Video?" haha wtf
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:54:35
Yeah, +1000
@_date: 2014-12-20 00:40:18
Yeah... this isnt anything like what I imagined back when I read the initial blog post about the 50 million in funding....
Doesnt even really sound interesting, although that may change I guess. Maybe this acts as a bridge between some of the general public and crypto currencies? Who knows right now I guess.
Does reddit plan on holding a portion of these notes themselves? If so, that would just sound like a path to more funding... without having to actually back the notes with shares.
@_date: 2014-12-02 17:06:15
Felt the need to post both the info link and video demo link to what reddcoin announced earlier.
Other than that, out of respect that this is the bitcoin subreddit, I will not be posting anymore links to this. Unless its significant.
BIP, Decentralized Web Wallet, that will allow tipping world wide without special code, plus many other features is a pretty cool thing for a crew with a budget and day jobs.
Thanks for reading.

Ive purchased my own coins time after time to pump it or dump a coin without losing anything but a small trading fee.
@_date: 2014-11-13 19:06:35
Just validated ethereum :) Now whenever ethereum provides updates, counterparty can easily implement those also without much concern for doing the work. Counterparty has just become the child of ethereum. Congratz :D
When the dust settles, I want to be around to see the reactions of those who are strictly team counterparty. I imagine it will be something to the tune of "Oh Sh**, maybe this wasnt as great for counterparty as I originally thought"
Ive done the pro's vs cons list of counterparty doing this, and in the end, Ethereum benefits from this the most.
For the record I own a decent chunk of xcp and also purchased eth. I personally dont care if one wins, both wins, or none wins, because I hold a decent chunk of bitcoin, reddcoin and fiat also. I always try to cover all angles possible.
When this news dies down, when those who also own xcp have a chance to really think about what just happened... they will start to realize how bad of a move this was.
Originally when I read the title, I was worried about how it would affect eth, and excited about my xcp at the same time. After breaking everything down into the positive and negative aspects, Im now honestly worried about my xcp.
It seems to be pumping now so that may not be an issue for me for long.
One thing is certain, ethereum must be decent at what it does, if a well established project is willing to port it over before it has even been launched...
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:17:26
Going back to some of your oldest videos, that damn thing had been chirping for years lolz. Buy a whole pack of 9v's lol
Houston ever catch up with those black money guys? Thats a scam and a half right there.

Never throw the first punch, especially not in a chess game you arent equipped to play.
@_date: 2014-11-16 01:09:00
BAHAHA! I own both bitcoin and in the future A LOT of eth, and this is awesome.
XCP created enough buzz to dump at decent profit, thanks counterparty lolz
@_date: 2015-05-09 12:38:23
Im surprised too. I asked my private tracker about it and they said it would NEVER have bitcoin as an option for donating.
I bet that changes though lol.
@_date: 2015-05-10 10:42:14
Its more for quality and privacy. You can pretty much guarantee whatever shows in search results on private trackers are exactly what they claim to be.
Privacy in that the copyright guys have their hands full on public trackers, putting up files and logging ip addresses. Suing etc. Thats just a couple of reasons to use private trackers.
And yes, often times if you are on a decent private tracker with its own file crew, the files comes out WELL in advance to public trackers.
I happen to only use trackers for linux distros and legit purposes though. So I could be completely wrong.
If someone offers you an invite to a private tracker, take it. But you should only be asking people you know. Ask a friend, you would be surprised how many people belong to private trackers.

DogeDump We have to remember that we dont speak for the devs, and that those decisions will be worked out once reddcoin/socialx/redd-id gets closer to an actual launch.
Lets not jump the gun an exclude anything or anyone right off the bat. Redd-ID/Safe Social Transactions are the end game, but that doesnt mean some of it cant benefit others also.
Also, pegging something as "impossible", isnt always accurate.
Edit. Changed "reddcoin" to "reddcoin/socialx/redd-id"
@_date: 2015-05-10 10:29:28
You've obviously contacted bitfinex support already. Keep us updated.
Check the blockchain against your bitfinex deposit address to see if it shows etc. Just so you can confirm you arent going crazy which Im sure anyone would feel in that situation.
@_date: 2015-05-09 13:08:02
This one is ran by the same people who run iptorrents. Was over a year ago when I asked about it.
@_date: 2014-11-23 13:58:50
Yeah well, there is a bunch of cryptsy traders who didnt see it as a joke. Thats okay though, we have a long memory.
@_date: 2014-11-23 02:49:06
Thats not how you framed it originally. Once they found out you were the excl dev, you backtracked real quick lolz.
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:27:15
BAHAHAHA LOLZ! Checkmate.
Judging by the code, counterparty wasnt just forked, it was recreated entirely. Hasnt been tested fully, but well... everyone gets the point lolz.
@_date: 2015-09-30 19:41:26
Im sure thats how you rationalize what happened, what still happens.
Lol Its all good.
Im glad see you guys have taken care of this issue also:

"Both situations aren't good. However, for a community that claims that it is trying to get rid of dictators, we're really fucking good at creating new dictators."
You know, the funny thing is I personally agree with theymos on most of the points he made about xt and I believe once people got into it and actually discussed it in depth, the general consensus of the community would have been the same. However the community at didnt get that chance.. did they?
So now instead of discussing and setting "community" precedent/mindset on what happens when the core devs themselves clash, we are faced with an even BIGGER problem. The fact that the r/bitcoin community (which happens to host a lot of bitcoiners) was robbed of the chance to hash it out (despite if the cores devs would have listened or not).
"I'd rather it be a guy with no external commercial interests."
Everyone who frequents this and other bitcoin related subreddits has a commercial interest in bitcoin to some respect. Whether it be the guy that wants to see bitcoin dominate over fiat, the person that holds a shit ton of btc, the person invested in various companies, the person looking to get into bitcoin, and even the person looking to get out.
The problems r/bitcoin faces today isnt special interests. Its the inability to separate interests from moderation and trying to shove discussion (valid discussion btw) under a rock as if it never existed. With r/bitcoin having such a large userbase, one could say that problems are EVERYONES problems.
"This is very bad. Wanna know why theymos didn't pass control of to someone else? It's because he was afraid of this exact scenario."
Id like to hear more of an explanation on that.
