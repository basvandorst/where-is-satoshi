One thing you may not have considered is that Korea has basically pulled out for now.
From the few I've talked to (speculators not HODLers), they're worried about the complications of withdrawing their gainz as the new Real Name ID regulations kick in.  They're also unclear whether they'll have to pay taxes on trades or withdrawals.
Korean gamblers / pump and dumpers are out of the picture.  This is a good thing.

Last year I was.  I'm still registered at most sites.
Some exchanges seem to be making their own interpretation of the "non-resident" rule or just don't want to deal with foreigners.
Bithumb actually has English-speaking staff.  I really hope they continue to support foreigners.  If not, I've got a friend who will help me out.

If you're going to compare crypto to the early days of the Internet, I think we're looking at the dial-up BBS era (c. 1995) still.  It's slow, tedious, command-line, obscure... some wallets are starting to look like AOL 1997 but keep in mind AOL was the gateway to the Internet for tons of people and we're not there yet.
So... 1995?  Who was into the Internet?  People who knew what it was capable of, testing it, using it for porn pics, apps, e-mail.  Very basic stuff.  I wouldn't stick an age on it.  I was 16 at the time but I think it was geeks/nerds of all ages who had at least tried some function of it (Usenet or E-mail)...
I don't think anyone was getting rich quite yet at that point.

This is pretty close to what I'd recommend.  I have a roughly 50/30 split between BTC/ETH with 20% on 4 promising alts.

It will be.  Not sure how you'd get the cash out of country, though.  If you travel through the US, be care of "legal forfeiture" (for any amount)... and you can't carry more than $10,000 cash anyway.  And wiring money in Korea is irritating... maybe try Western Union or other services?  Not sure if it's worth it since the arb rate is only 9% currently and it's been dropping every day.

Not citizenship but at least residency... You need a bank account and cell number and ID to get verified on exchanges for fiat withdrawal. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:56:36
Iota, ARK, Enjin, and WTC... solid to me anyways. I'm in none of them for gains but I admit that I bought in so low that I'm already happy with my position.
Monero... If I do go for a privacy coin, that's definitely the one. I just haven't had any spare fiat lately to do so (though I'm considering switching from one alt to Monero).

But seriously, yeah.  The fees are ridiculous and only worth dealing with when you've got bigger amounts.  The exchanges (at the very least) need to reduce how much BTC they shave off the top.

Hello Elmer FUDster.  If Bitcoin drops that hard, it has probably failed.
There have been enough attempts to drop the price by whales and they managed to bring it down a whole 30%.  That's it.  Even after the Thanksgiving Bullrun.
If we see 12K, expect zero shortly after.  Not gonna happen.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:10:30
Lol.  Good answer.  And I am a teacher... teachers can frustrated by the same questions again and again, ya know?
In the end, you have to make your own call.  Trezor is good for Bitcoin (and it's forks like BCH, BTG, LTC) and not bad for ETH and the ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain... Ledger is good for many, many alt-coins but has limitations that you should look into (a limit on how many coins it can handle at once)...
The others... not so much.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:29:52
FUD post.  Korean exchanges are highly unlikely to shut down.  They're already regulated and the Korean government has simply announced they're going to enforce the real ID rules... which most exchanges do in some form or another already (can't get a Korean phone or bank account without ID anyway).

Yup.  I know it.  Need to read up more on that too.  But it has at least speed advantage over Bitcoin (and cost of transfer)... as much as I hope, I can't see IOTA or another over-taking ETH's 2nd place status anytime soon... and it does have potential more than BTC I think for coffee-buying scenarios.

The fee in BTC depends on how many inputs/outputs you have but yeah... it's insane right now... and could take days or even a week to go back down to a reasonable level.

The transaction would get processed and confirmed before the first one... making the first one invalid.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:15:29
Some of the dips are somewhat predictable... I don't believe this one was.  People only started to realize what was happening when the mempool was jammed and transaction fees were rising... and it was already too late.
I'm still curious what those folks with transactions pending intend to do when their transactions actually go through... will they sell no matter the price, continuing this dip into the New Year?  Or will BTC rise in the meantime and they just got forced into HODLing...?
Remember one thing: whales control this market.  The rest of us are along for the ride.

Cold storage usually refers to paper wallets, doesn't it?
Trezor and Ledger upgrade fairly often... That isn't cold storage though... But they're both pretty secure.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:29:21
The Korean government has not.  This is a scare tactic by the same Western media that likes to talk about how imminent the invasion by North Korea is.  Not gonna happen.
BTW, I'm S. Korea.  They're just clamping down on exchanges that violate the regulations, something they might not have been doing before.  I'm not sure because there's a lot more exchanges here than I'm a member of... and I'm on 6 of them.
I see so many of these "Korea is Shutting Down Exchange" posts that's getting tiresome responding to them all.  It's not going to happen unless the Korean government turns a 360.  And they won't unless they want protests in the street.
As for decentralized exchanges, I'm all for them... I just don't know anything about them.

Fifth time I've countered this in 24 hours.  Anyone who thinks South Koreans are worried about Kim Jongun doesn't understand South Korea.
When you live in a cold war for almost 70 years, it becomes routine.  The SK army is prepared and the US is here.
Even when the North has crossed the line, the South merely cuts off aid and the North starves.
Koreans just love gambling and get rich quick schemes.  They love the pump and dump.  Stocks and real estate are shitty options here and BTC is the next big thing.
TL;DR: Don't believe the hype. We're fine.
Yes, I live in South Korea.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:35:03
That's one way to put it... Don't invest what you can't afford to lose.
But you know, I view this as: "Invest only what you can afford to ignore for a very long, long time if necessary."  I think this advice can hold true with Bitcoin.  Other alts could go to zero a lot easier than Bitcoin.

War in North Korea is inevitable?  Do you really believe everything you read?
Even with the continuous games of brinkmanship for 60+ years, nothing of real consequence has happened.  Sure a few rockets got fired, North Korea's crossed the line towards war *a lot*.  South Korea looks at them like the bratty little brother and just continuously forgives them for their outbursts.
And that's pretty much the way it will continue until the DPRK collapses.
North Korea knows that any actual war with the South will ruin both countries and they'd rather use South Korea's resources... without China, they'd simply be unable to take the peninsula.  So, if you're worried about war, worry about China.
And you're not.  Why not?  China needs US Dollars like the US needs Chinese products.
And since this is supposed to be about Bitcoin, you should know that the real estate market here is super-expensive, stocks are down, interest rates are shit, and there's only one casino in S. Korea that Koreans can legally enter...
Crypto is partly investment and partly gambling (okay, probably most gambling).
But isn't the truth for us all?

@_date: 2017-12-08 08:42:58
First, I'm not Korean... but I have been here 14 years and I understand enough of Korean culture to know they have a natural gambling streak.  I even hear my teenage students say this when prodding someone to go all in while gambling - "are you a man?" Although admittedly we're just playing Zombie Dice.  There are 10 casinos here but only 1 legal for natives and it's huge and packed to the brim... and there are numerous stories of addicted gamblers in this country... people mortgaging their homes to play the lotto... so, yeah... it's greed, FOMO, etc.
Somehow I can't imagine Chinese culture being too different in that regard...
And yeah, I don't understand why arbitrators haven't taken care of the price difference... or maybe they are and it's their own greed helping to drive the KRW price up.  Even at the current moment, Korean Exchanges are still $3K above Bitfinex, which is only slightly better than the $4-5K it was yesterday.  It's usually a mere a 10%, something which is kind of irrelevant when you remember that there are 2 kinds of Bitcoin buyers anyway: the HODLers (who know the value will go up anyway) and the gamblers/traders (who calculate their profit in local fiat)... And although I suspect a lot of the movement in Korea is usually due to the gamblers, there are also probably a lot of HODLers here too.  Koreans are often on the cutting-edge of tech, right?  Fastest Internet in the world, First country to reach 99.9% LTE coverage (and LTE-A as well) and they're already working on 5G lol... I could go on.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:43:31
In a few short months I've learned what it truly means to HODL.  Around here you'll often see: "Don't invest what you can't afford to lose."

The main problem with jailbroken/rooted phones is the ability to install apps that aren't authorized/checked by Apple/Google... Especially if they're pre-installed with the jailbreak/root tool/rom.
Unauthorized apps or possibly even apps from the official store could have some malicious code in them that goes outside it's permissions... takes a screenshot or checks for a wallet file and shares it to a hacker.
Mobile wallets are also notoriously bad at security features.  They might keep your wallet file unencrypted, transmit unencrypted sensitive data...
So, yeah... the risk is great.  Don't keep too much coins in your mobile wallet if you're going to try to do this.
Much better to get a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:16:08
If you're waiting for a dip, you missed it.
The ATH today could be higher than the dip tomorrow.
People may be getting in before the Futures market gets started on Monday.
Maybe it's whales getting ready to shake loose and hands and it'll dip to $10K after hitting $15K.
So, uh... yeah, good luck.  Whatever you do, hold on 'cause no one knows when this roller-coaster goes up and down... we just know it's going to the MOOOOOOON.

Interesting read. The fatwa link doesn't seem to work for me. In any case, there are more than one I've heard of, and in the end, it is still up to Islamic governments first, and Muslim individuals to decide whether Bitcoin and other CryptoCurrencies are acceptable...

Exactly this.  As a Canadian living in Korea, I'm used to thinking of currencies in prices relative to each other.  I've seen the "price" of CAD or USD go down and I think "whoo, I can buy more stuff with my KRW" or alternatively "my work salary has become more valuable."
This is exactly how you should think of Bitcoin: the exchange rate.  I measure my BTC against other currencies because I want it to go up so I can use it to buy more stuff.

I think there are still concerns over it, namely that USDT isn't actually backed by US Dollars.
But I also never thought it was a big deal.  It's no different than when you make a fiat deposit and the exchange shows your fiat balance... except that USDT is transferable between exchanges who trust that Bitfinex will back it.
Bitfinex has done it's best to prove it is a good exchange.  It seems more and more unlikely that Tether is just an overly\-complex exit scheme.

Trying to answer your own question? 2FA by mobile is not the safest option. It can be hacked too. Get 2FA that can be synced or recovered even if you lose your phone (I use Lastpass but there are others).
2nd, coins kept on an exchange are not yours. Actually your name is just in a database with an IOU. The Exchange's coins are kept in various wallets. Those wallets can be hacked. In fact, this is the most common way coins have been stolen in the past... How many this year? 3? 5?
Would you buy a gold bar from a gold dealer and then ask them nicely to hold onto it for a while?

The problem here is that crypto can seem like it moves so fast... but it could take years to come back.
The best advice I've seen here for "real" waiting is to be in for at least the next 2 halvings... if HODLing really is what you want to do.

DYOR. But from what I have read, the Rothschilds did indeed make money in banking/trading deals. But they had enough heirs to dilute the ancient fortune quite a bit. There are probably still a few of them who are millionaires (not such a big deal when you consider how many "old money" millionaires there are in the world).
It's just a silly idea that a single group of people have had their claws controlling the banks for centuries... Note that this video conveniently omits the Jewish and Illuminati parts of the conspiracy, since those are laughed off by most intelligent people (although some people still buy the entire "German Jewish Banker Illumanti" package). But indeed they were Jewish, probably played on multiple sides in many wars, but so so most profiteers.

If I remember, it started way before the fork in August and became deadly obvious afterwards...
The New York Agreement was probably the first obvious sign that Roger Ver, Jihan Wu \(Bitmain, Antpool\) were all in bed together, when they tried to force the hand of exchanges and Core into agreeing to the 2X fork.
Bitcoin Core \(the devs I mean\) might even have agreed to the 2X change if it hadn't been for the nodes signalling against it.  If I remember, 80&amp; or more of nodes were signalling "NO2X" \- and according to consensus rules, nodes enforce the rules, not the miners.  The miners \(Antpool/Bitmain\) didn't like this.  They're supposed to secure the network, not make the rules.
The phrase "Satoshi's vision" was thrown around a lot, and still is.  But it's always been a smokescreen.  Bitmain's ASICs can't do Segwit... increasing the block size was an effort to avoid Segwit, keeping Bitmain's ASICs profitable.

Wow.  Disputed and autonomous... I can see why you might have trouble.  Surely there's a way you could use some BTC to buy a plane ticket and move to a nice beach somewhere...?
If I were you, I'd send an **extremely** trusted family member abroad, get them to bring along an \(empty\) Trezor that you set up \(with multiple wallets\), transfer some BTC to the outer wallet so they can use that to buy you a plane ticket to get the F out.  Then transfer the rest to a passworded wallet \(that they don't have access to\)... and neither do you until you get your hands on the Trezor again... You're awfully close to Russia... I wouldn't want to travel with access to that much Bitcoin... am I being paranoid?
Jeez. What a pickle.  But seriously.  If you really have even more than 100 BTC, get the F out and and go retire somewhere nice.  Be paranoid as hell.

What's your reasoning?  Admittedly the chart for a few months look nasty but BTC has had some particularly nasty months, too.
I don't think ETH has the moon-shot potential that BTC does but I do think that ETH has more potential to be a stable, slow-gaining currency and that June-July fall was a result of too much, too fast - people hoping it would be the moon-shot like BTC and it's not...
Mind you, the quick rise right now makes me think it's happening again... but I'm thinking it's also people bailing on BTC and staying away from BCH.  (So... 2 days more of this and then...?)
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:21:40
In the last few weeks, I put in an equal amount to BTC and ETH...
Guess which one is doing better at the current moment?  ETH seems not to do the heavy correct that BTC does after a rise.  Of course, ETH also doesn't do the moonshot that BTC does when it does rise.
I treat ETH as my stable investment for now and BTC is my moon-dream.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:34:03
I just started to understand this but this is a great simple explanation.
For 2 days, BTC will continue a little fall, due in part to transactions getting slower.  When the miners come back to BTC, prices will rise again.  Maybe not a moon-shot but... we'll see.
In other words, a simple way to predict the dip and pick up some cheaper BTC.  And notice given to BCH holders: get out while you can.
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:53:21
I may be wrong but that chart has changed in just 15 minutes and ETH and BTC volume are both picking up in Korea again...  ETH went from 3ish% to 6-8% volume (depending on which exchange you look at).  I'm guessing Koreans are getting ready to bail.  Almost 10pm here... and the orders on the books are now in 1's and 2's instead of 50's and 100s.  Heh.

I think you mean it's like adding a 100-dollar lock to a 10-dollar safe. It doesn't increase the security of the wallet.
Actually I was wondering this, too...  I've been using Electrum and considering a Trezor... But I've left half of my BTC on the Exchange because I suddenly realized this fact.

Here's a question.  Why run a node?  I assume that this helps transactions go through faster and every little bit speeds up the network...
But isn't that what the miners are for?  I mean they make profit by mining and confirming, right?
What would I get out of it?  Would I get a cut of the transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:10:46
This is one thing I've been wondering, too... is it possible?
But I suspect no one miner wants to be the one who lights the match.  Even if most miners stop mining BTC, there will be a few who selfishly go for that last bitcoin, because BTC value wouldn't have totally collapsed yet and they can still cash in big without competition.  So, again, who wants to be the first, when you are unsure of who will follow...?
I did have one curious question.  This seems like a good place to ask... see if anyone knows...
Miners are the ones who verify transactions, right?  Can non-mining, verification nodes be set up?  Would you need a powerful rig to do so?
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:34:52

This.  Exactly this.  I've noticed this about myself, too... anxiety is a sign of overinvestment.  The last few days has been kind of wild and it has stayed under my most recent buy... but I've been learning to laugh at the dips and smile when it goes back up again.

But, the Korean stock market is in flames anyway, even if global perception doesn't match reality.  The Korean stock market has been bad lately thanks to Korea impeaching its president and arresting the CEO "son of" Samsung on graft, corruption, blah blah... and the housing market hasn't been going well either.  Interest rates suck globally...
AND Koreans have gambling more in their blood than any culture on earth.  Heh.  Seriously.  There's no capital gains tax here so... that doesn't help their gambling attitude...  I think we can look forward to the "Korean Pump and Dump" to be an almost weekly Saturday activity now.  Pay attention and you can get some Korean money, too.
I wouldn't worry too much about Kim Jong Un... who is smart enough to pretend to be crazy.  Worry more about Trump, who is so stupid, you can't even call him crazy.

With Bithumb actively promoting Monero, every other crypto is going to dip pretty hard for the next week.  Me?  I'm waiting at least a few more days before I buy more Bitcoin.
This is the same effect that the Koreans had on Bitcoin during the BCH and ETH pumps lately.  I'm not worried, just waiting a bit.
Of course, Bitcoin has been pretty strong lately.  I may be wrong.  But I do expect BCH to dip _really_ hard.

As far as I understand, nodes are MORE important than miners.  If I understand it...
Miners add transactions to to the blockchain when mining but it is nodes that verify the transactions and the blockchain itself.  Miners do not validate the ENTIRE blockchain, which is why mining clusters usually include one or more nodes or their mining work doesn't get validated...
Maybe I just don't understand how the whole thing works but, I'm curious why miners are the ones who add the transactions to the blockchain... and it's kind of with the OP anyway... if all the miners up and quit, then transactions would not get processed...?
Am I wrong about any of this?
And yeah, maybe you're an old hack who's been dealing with bitcoin noobs for years... and I've been here a week.  It really is complicated to wrap my head around the technicals... but relax.

Sorry that page isn't visible but I just gave an example of a "zero fee" (again, it's not)...
A coupon good for 12 million in trading (about $12000).  It costs 9,000 won ($9) up front.  So "free" trading but considering Bithumb's standard maker/taker fees of 0.15%... you wouldn't save any money until you've done 6 million in trades... but if you completely use up the limit (12 million), you've paid 0.075% fees instead.
Deposit/withdrawals are free with or without the coupons.
You can buy coupons good for 10 billion in trading ($10 million) which reduces the total percentage to 0.025% but again... it expires in 30 days.  That one costs 2.5 million ($2500).
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:22:46
OK.  So I joined Bithumb.  It's not as English-friendly as Korbit but I was getting annoyed by Korbit's max transfer of 0.35 BTC per day anyway.  Good way to add dust to my wallet, eh?
Anyways, you're still wrong about zero fees.  But there are "flat coupons" available on Bithumb that reduce transaction fees by a lot... and because they're essentially coupons (with a discount) applied to a certain amount of future transactions... yeah, it encourages Koreans to gamble.
It's actually here: 
Additional info?  They expire after 30 days.  Jeez.  Even the lowest one is 12 million won (about $12,000) for 9 bucks.  So it would basically only save money if you did more than 6 million won in trading... in 4 weeks.  Really encouraging them to gamble.

Lol.  I'm in Korea (but not Korean).  We're more afraid of Trump being a giant douche than we are about the North.
Real estate holding tax laws are about to change so landowners will get hit harder.  Korean stocks and the Won are slipping as an effect of the tension, but not so badly as you'd expect... and it may be also a result of the tension with China that has been going on since last year.
People are just looking for ways to get their money in a safer, more profitable place.  Crypto is in the popular mind, so Koreans are looking there.
Oh, I should probably mention there's only one legal casino in the whole country for them, too (the others are non-Korean only).  Koreans love gambling and when they do, they roll big.
Watching Korbit is probably going to give me a heart attack one day... jeez, they sell and buy big here.
So, yeah, the Korean contribution to the market is big but I don't think the dick-measuring war of words is the direct cause.
Probably the result of this will be the same as last time, "peace" talks whereby South Korea and the US promise aid in exchange for nuclear talks after the North fires a few more missiles at a border village (killing half a dozen), kidnap a few more fisherman, and sabre-rattle a bit more.

Excellent explanation.  I think I got it 100% now.  I've been considering running a node myself and it looks like it's even possible on this PC right now even if just the 6 hours or so when I'm home and my PC is on.
When I upgrade my NAS (not possible with the model I have), I'll be able to do it 24/7.

Yeah... I remember someone used to say Kim Jong-il saying "I'll turn Seoul into a sea of fire" was like a catch phrase that no one ever took seriously.
But, really... my personal guess is that with the entire impeachment and investigation into Samsung and other big players in South Korea lately (nothing new but the new government is trying to take a hard line), the tension with China over THAAD, and the tension with Japan over the comfort women, North Korea is just feeling a bit left out...
Oh, and I think Kim Jong-un is hoping when Samsung Junior gets fined, he can get a cut of the money... Heh.

A lot of the movement (again) is in Korea.  I'm here and giving myself a heart attack just watch the trading charts at Korbit.
I've said it before.  I'll say it again.  I'm pretty sure they're gambling.  And Koreans don't do anything small.
I believe the other theories about a pump and dump.  Koreans are probably well aware of this.  As I watch the charts here, they fluctuate wildly with 50-200 buck swings in seconds sometimes.  They're buying hundreds of BCH at a time, trying to ride the momentum.  I really doubt they're even holding for very long.
If it really is a pump and dump, Koreans will continue to surf the BCH wild ride until they get back to work Monday morning.  24 hours later, Bincoin's Segwit kicks in.  By then, sober second-thoughts will have prevailed and Koreans will get off the BCH ride, especially if the price drops.
Until then, Hold On for Dear Life.  (And buy the dip?)

"Home mining" requires tweaking, setting schedules, monitoring, blah blah blah.  Perhaps Bitmain is an asshole company that ruined what could have been true egalitarian mining for people who aren't crypto-nerds.  An ASIC miner is a great idea: turn on, set up wallet, start mining...

Most major banks in Korea have been hacked, too, with funds gone missing. The banks had to shut down for days, locking millions of people out of their funds. When the Agricultural Collective Bank was hacked, I couldn't use my card either for debuting or atms for almost a week. Thank God I had a credit card and a bit of cash. They later revealed it was nearly $100,000,000 gone... A huge amount for what is essentially a government-sponsored co-op bank (and top 5 bank in Korea).
It's a hazard of being the target of the world's largest (2nd?) cyber-army. Yeah. North Korea.

Really.  It completed on a 60GB SSD with the pruned configuration set... I'm guessing it deleted old info as it passed the prune threshold.  Actually when initially setting it up, it was set to 1000 and still hasn't eaten up that much disk space despite changing it to 2000 partway through.
I'm running the latest Mint Linux and it was dead simple to get going using the Ubuntu instructions for a full node.  Just set that line in the configuration file once Bitcoin Core is running, then exit and restart the program (to make the config stick).

I'm in Korea too and staying the heck away from BCH.
Bithumb almost always leads the way with pump and dumps.  I don't trust Koreans as HODLers and any news that appears to dump or hold the bag will first be spread privately, secondly in Korean channels, thirdly on Korean boards, before finally outsiders know they're being screwed.
So unless your friends are in one of the first 3 categories, I'd advise they stay away too.  Saturday night here... and you might notice... BCH is already heading down.
Of course, others think this is manipulation, FUD against BTC, etc.  I wouldn't doubt any of it.  Perfect storm.  I'm not playing in a hurricane.

Almost all exchanges set higher fees than necessary on all cryptocurrencies.

It's hard to predict the spikes and crashes of Bitcoin.  I agree I'm not in it for the fork and I'd be surprised if it didn't dip significantly before, during, AND after the fork.  People all have different strategies to deal with this (and during for the people who have none at all)...
But I'd be more surprised if it dipped more than 15% and didn't recover 10% immediately.  Think you can catch that 10% difference (minus fees)?  You could make 1.1 BTC out of 1 BTC but is it worth the risk?  Bitcoin could make the fiat difference back quickly anyway...

Hm.  Tried.  Doesn't work with IOT/KRW pairing - it actually doesn't exist anyway but... I will fiddle with it later and do a IOT/USD to USD/KRW conversion and see what happens.

    =SUM(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(IMPORTDATA(" "{"&amp;CHAR(34)&amp;"KRW"&amp;CHAR(34)&amp;":",""),"}","")+0)
Yeah, it's convoluted and doesn't update often as a published sheet (like 15-30 minutes sometimes) but when editing, it updates every 60 seconds or less.

@_date: 2017-11-02 17:00:49
You're missing something. The forked coins are attached to the address of your BTC at the time of the fork... Unless the 2x forked chain replays BTC transactions.
Read up on replay protection and see what Trezor and Ledger and others did when the BCH fork happened. The difference is that BCH had replay protection. No one knows yet how 2x will handle replay... Same goes for BTG (and that fork already happened).

The usual fees are actually 0.15% but you can buy a coupon that equalizes 12 million in trading down to 0.075%... even the cheapest fee is 0.0025% (with 100 billion won in trading)... coupons expire in 30 days so they probably make a ton of money from expired coupons and/or trades that take up more than the quota left on the coupon.
TL;DR: Bithumb is not "no fee."

I imagine it might be best to use passphrases/passwords (aka the 25th word) for different accounts on the same hardware wallet.
This definitely works on a Trezor. It basically results in entirely different wallets.

$80 a week and ball out on dips?  Absolutely.  Even if you eat ramen for a week... you can pass on your next $80 because you already made more than that in BTC.
I'm expecting a loan payback this week.  I'll throw it all in when I see even the slightest dip (probably Friday or Saturday) and HODL.  Bitcoin doesn't care about strategy or predictions... it will go up... dips have become smaller and faster.
I would recommend to you since you're starting small, use a trustworthy exchange and withdraw your BTC to a wallet every 1 or 2 months to save on the withdrawal fees (unless you have free withdrawals).  And make sure you're using a Segwit Wallet address to HODL so getting it back later is cheaper.

Or a pruned node.  My old notebook only has 60GB... good enough to verify transactions.  I set "prune=2000" (20GB) in the configuration and it took 7 days to download and verify the blockchain but as of today I am now a node... whoo.

I use Lastpass Secure notes with Trusted Contacts.
The contact should request access to my vault and it will be released to them if I do not respond in a given time (I've set mine for 30 days).  I'm not sure to trust Lastpass completely ("never put your seed online anywhere") but there is enough info in there to get at my coins should the need arise.

Here you go.  It's a bit convoluted but it works really well.
You can switch BTC to almost any 3-letter crypto code and although I use KRW, you can use almost any currency here, too.  It tends to be a little higher value than Blockfolio, but mostly accurate.
One issue is that as a published Sheet, reloading it doesn't always update it (due to Google caching the data).  But in editing mode, it updates every 1 or 2 minutes.

I would personally love to see an option on exchanges to donate your dust to a charity.  It doesn't cost the exchanges anything to move the dust internally... and let's say even 1000 users with 178 satoshis?  That's like $15 for Doctors without Borders or something...

Depends on your exchange, I imagine.  Some are more trustworthy than others...?  Nevertheless, isn't the Trezor Model T not due out until January?  Wouldn't that put it around Fenruary or March for your delivery?  Seems like a long time to put your faith in an exchange...
In the meantime, you could (at worst) make a paper wallet for free... stick it with your passport or somewhere else safe and scan it over to your Trezor later...

There is one solution I've seen floating around that involves:
Waiting until 1 chain is at least a few (or dozen) blocks longer than the other and then putting an expiry time (specified by block number) on a send transaction and sending it out.  Since one chain already passed that block number, it will be considered expired and not process.  The other chain will process it and viola!  Your coins are successfully split.  (And send the remaining coins to a new address to be 100% sure.)
At least... that's the simple way I understand it.
And of course, if it fails, you still control the wallets that the coins went to.... right??
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:58:57
It's mostly a non-issue...
Because the coins themselves don't disappear, just the keys. They're still on the blockchain. In the future, it may be possible to use a quantum computer to scan the blockchain and unlock wallets that are not quantum-resistant...
Which would effectively release a lot of lost coins. I thought I read elsewhere that the cryptography was made quantum-proof a few years ago... So not all could be recovered... There will always be an increasing number of lost coins.
Anyone want to correct me?

With 50158 inputs, the cost to extract those 64-odd BTC would be pretty high, wouldn't it?
I couldn't find a current formula but on a legacy address, but I'm guessing it hasn't changed.
50158 Inputs x 180 + 2 Outputs x 34 + 10 = 9,028,518 bytes
Let's say 220 satoshis per byte = 19.86273960 BTC to the miner who handles the transaction leaving 44+ BTC to the person who can crack it... Even at a measly 50 satoshis per byte = 4.5 BTC for the fee...
Is this right?

GPUs that have been used for intensive mining are more prone to failure... even if only used for a few months, they've endured the equivalent of years of gaming.  Even 1/5 of the price might not be worth getting a used 1080 or 1070 when it might have to be replaced in less than a year.

Value / price is determined by liquid supply and current demand.  As demand outweighs liquid supply, the price goes up. The so-called Satoshi original addresses add up to about 4 million BTC.  If these were to be recovered and suddenly put on the market, we'd see a devastating fall, especially if they were offered at a buyer's price.
Which is why HODLing is actually important... it keeps a lot of the BTC off the open market.

Lastpass has the "trusted contacts" feature.  It allows a specific contact (also a LP user) access to y ourpassword and secure notes vault if they request access you don't deny it in a certain number of days (1-30, your choice).
This is how I'm doing it.  The 24 Word Seed for my Trezor is in my notes. 25th word passphrase would be fairly easy for family to guess but strangers would have a hard time.  In this way, I can keep changing my security and just leave notes in LP for them to puzzle through after I'm dead.
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:30:33
I keep the 24 word key to my Trezor in my Lastpass.  Lastpass has a great "trusted contacts" feature.  If I die, my brother will have access to that key and a note that says "I'm Dead" with instructions how to retreive my BTC and other crypto.
Note:  I don't trust Lastpass 100% so I also use a 25th keyword which isn't in that Secure Note but there's a hint that only he and maybe 12 other people could figure out.

I don't think it is about "crazy controls" since workers who have signed up for jobs SHOULD be given some compensation when a company decides to "restructure".

I'm a little confused by this. Can you clarify?
1st, you make 2 transactions every time and regenerate a new base wallet / private key?
2nd, you seem to imply this is automatic by some wallets?

Why do people continue to think that Bithumb has zero fees?  It doesn't.  We're encouraged to buy coupons that stand in place of trading fees.  So instead of losing BTC or KRW in the process of buying/selling, we lose a portion of the coupon.  The basic coupon is 9000 KRW for 12,000,000 worth of trades (it comes out to 0.075%), which is pretty low but the coupon also expires within a month so it encourages day-trading.  There are (of course), higher-tier coupons that reduce the fees to insanely low numbers... but none are free (and again, expire within a month).  Lol, the most expensive coupon costs 2.5 million KRW (=2,218 USD) and reduces the fee to 0.025%.  Again (for the third time), it expires.  Unused portions of the coupon are not refunded.  I'm sure Bithumb is making a killing with this technique.

They do say if you try to forcibly open a Trezor, because it is sealed using ultrasound, the entire casing will be destroyed.
I would say, see if you can open it with your fingernails.  Look for glue marks or other signs that the casing is counterfeit.
But chances are that if the firmware can be updated, it's genuine.
Of course, contact Trezor staff to be sure.  They would know better than we would.

Not impossible but they made it really darn hard... well, more like annoying... the exchanges have affiliated themselves with banks (to make verifying the names on the accounts easier).

I don't think that's hyper-inflation.  I think that's landlords taking a cue from the crooked banks... or was it the other way around?

I don't code but I know people who do. They tend to be highly critical of other peoples' code.  If they find a flaw in an update, they would inform the company and community within minutes.  Since Trezor is open-source, you can be assured there are is at least one person out there who doesn't work for Trezor and has studied it for weakness... which is exactly how the last vulnerability was exposed and quickly fixed.

Isn't the problem with this idea that the big miners are basically all competing against each other to get the next block?
If I understood how the mining algorithm works... without the big mining hardware, we'd be using GPUs and CPUs still... and blocks would be uncovered at the same frequency they are now.  So, that means the big miners are basically at a war with each other... the ones with the fastest mining equipment (and some luck) win the next block
Or did I misunderstand... and the miners have actually sped up the rate of mining?

I'm in Korea and I noticed this too. Yeah you could probably make a bit of coin or cash...
But not even a month ago, the positions were reversed. We were paying 5-10% more...
I'd rather do it with Canada, where Bitcoin (and others) are even more expensive...
But what would happen if it reversed before you had the chance to cash out? Or fiat currency exchange rapidly changed. It might be okay if you were holding cash or coin that you wanted anyway... But you could lose out too.
Throw in the 2-4 days that banks seem to take with wire transfers and the volitility that is crypto... When it works, it would be a tidy $200 per BTC. When it fails... Could lose much more.

Well... this is something.  I don't know if it will have the far-reaching effect that the ban in China did "tightening regulations" on Bitcoin was already done.  "Increased monitoring" means... what?

At the end of October, the PRC convenes their 19th Congress... we might see some effects coming out of that as well... I think if the Chinese miners are worried about being over-regulated, we may see them dumping their reserves leading up to that date.
After that... Segwit2X may not happen.  Miners and Exchanges are dropping support for the NY Agreement and we've yet to see what effect Chinese regulations have on the miners.

I'm not sure anyone has mentioned this but... I saw some talk of whales unloading.  Those whales... might they be miners who will need to pay their pills, their workers?
If they see the ban as lasting awhile, they're loading up on fiat so they can continue operating while they wait out the ban.
I think with Sunday evening approaching here in Asia, we might see some more sharp dips as the desperate to sell get more desperate.  But aside from that, the end of the dip should be ending...

I hope so!  But, yeah, pay very close attention to the exchange you're buying on.  Some exchanges will add support within hours and some will take days and some.... jeez... like Korbit may just be supporting the fork and not core.  I wouldn't want to buy from them a few days before or after (despite the dip) just in case...

I believe Core will be adding a different signature to their transactions...?  I don't quite understand it.
The problem is that when the split happens, the 2X nodes will basically be running what is until that point, the same software as Core nodes, with a minor alteration to acceptable block size.  Core Nodes will reject any double-sized blocks from 2X miners/nodes automatically... but Core Blocks may be accepted by 2X nodes unless they are explicitly told not to, like with a new signature that doesn't conform to what they expect.
Again... I'm not even sure I understand what I'm talking about.  But yeah, it basically means that if you want to keep your core coins, be extremely careful with your transactions when the fork starts to kick in.
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:18:53
Er.  Your gamble I think has a good chance to be good... but if by some chance of fate, the 2X chain is ruled as "incumbent" by Bitfinex, you and everyone else who put into BT1 is screwed and get nothing.
Sidenote.  If anyone is daring enough... is it possible to pick up some BT1 now... an equal part of BT2 later (as it collapses) and then combine them into BTC?  Heh.  Probably won't work...

I was reading somewhere else on here that a quantum computer would be able to search the blockchain and easily decode current and legacy addresses and with that, be able to retrieve "lost" or unsecured coins.
Which is why eventually our wallet addresses will have to be updated (just like Segwit) to make them secure against that.

Yeah I considered this too.  I have an old S4 I wasn't using.  That was the exact thought I had.  It's rooted, slimmed-down and Tasker installed to force it offline... but I still can't be 100% certain about all those apps that may be there.  What about the battery dying eventually?  Also, even a broken down shit phone is a quick target for thieves.  A Trezor isn't much to look at, doesn't need a battery, and has been inspected by the community and proven safe.  $140ish bucks and delivered to your door within a week.  Once you pass $200, you'll thank yourself.

I like that it allows passphrase protection to be disabled so it only looks like you have an outer wallet.  It's been well-supported by the devs and well-analyzed by the open source community.  It works on Windows, Linux, Android, OSX so likely future-proof for a decade or more.  If the Trezor company fails, the community will pick it up and keep it going for another decade or longer.  Everything a long-term HODLer desires - except that it doesn't support a lot of alt-coins - but... the Trezor 2 is coming (eventually)... and coin devs will likely be on top of this.
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:27:50
Well... I like the Ledgers.  They're pretty, cheap, and support a lot of coins.
Personally I went with Trezor because it's open source, therefore more trustworthy.  The only alt-coins I hold have their own wallet (ARK, IOTA) or are ERC-20 tokens anyway.

The Hani is trash but nevermind that.  You got it wrong.  Try Google translate.  The government is just fighting money-laundering.  Korea doesn't have capital gains tax so I wouldn't doubt that illegal money is indeed being worked through cryptos... In other news, water is wet.
The exchanges are already regulated.  And news just came out that Korbit is being bought by Nexon.  And Kakao is getting into crypto too.  Korea will not ban cryptos, the exchanges, or using a crypto for trade.  Likely Korea will be ahead of the curve when it comes to full-scale adoption, especially with a leftist government currently in power.

I don't even need to read this to argue... Crypto exchanges in Korea are ALREADY regulated and insured just like banks or other investment services (50 million dollars or some absurd number).  They're not going to crack down on the exchanges.  They're going to force the exchanges to stop Koreans from gambling away their life savings and help expose money-launderers.

There are currently no capital gains tax in Korea.  It encourages people to invest in Samsung and lose their money on the stock market.  I'm kind of serious, kind of sarcastic, but not kidding.

Good quote.  "Wet streets cause rain" = lol.  And as a foreigner living in S. Korea, I've learned to ignore almost anything the Western media has to say about N. Korea and take the S. Korean media's news with a grain of salt.  But these 3 stories coming together around Bitcoin make an interesting story in itself, something I can admittedly only speculate on.
But, again, I've gleaned the facts from reputable enough sources and not completely ridiculous.  And that's the problem when discussing N. Korea: people are so ready to believe the ridiculous, they sometimes pass over what is more plausibly true.  It's a fact that N. Korea has a hard time trading with the outside world and without China, they'd be up shit creek.  China has only watched over it to keep a political buffer zone between S.Korea/Japan/US... and of course, keeping the Kims in power also keeps millions of starving people on their doorstep instead of in their house.  It's also fact that N. Korea has had its fingers in the international drug trade (marijuana, cocaine, but I believe meth is their money-maker now).  Drugs, counterfeit US bills, and malware seem to be their only income.  They have no natural resources to export.  And with trade bans in place with almost every country, China has basically been laundering money for them.  Bitcoin was probably a very useful tool for this.  With Bitcoin, they could collect anywhere in the world easily and then use a Chinese exchange to get yuan and then use that buy stuff.
No, you won't find most of this in the media directly.  I doubt that hurting N. Korea was an integral part of the Chinese strategy here, but... I'll bet someone in the Chinese government thought about it, for better or worse.
I'm not a conspiracy theorist by any stretch.  But something seems up...

Again.  Do a search.  Quantum computers will find those lost Bitcoins.  Like treasure-hunting the blockchain.  I'm pretty sure someone already said post 2013?14? wallets are quantum-proof but any lost coins predating that point will be recovered in 10-20 years...
If Bitcoin really does outlast this century, future computers will likely be able to crack other wallets, too.
Nothing is ever really "lost" forever.

Maximize profit... Heh.  Bitcoin will not let you down if you stay in the game long enough.
I think this post is brilliant to help ease your mindset when you see you're down 10% or more: Personally, I keep most of my holdings in BTC.  I've got around 6% in IOTA, Walton, and ARK, 3 projects which seem promising to me, and ETH to provide a little bit of stability to that 6%.  I expect 1 or 2 to leap forward sometime next year... Hopefully a 20X return on one with the others lost completely in the dust.  But even with all of that 6% in the red, BTC has (this week at least) kept me in the green.
Sidenote: it seems best to buy on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  Lately the prices seem to sink and stay there during the week and go up on a weekend, unless (of course) there's some serious FUD going around.

Trezor is great for BTC, ETH (and ETH ERC-20 tokens), LTC, BCH...  I've got 2, one from the Trezor Store and one from an Amazon seller (in-ear-com).
The Amazon one was which was cheaper, and turned out to have a slightly older bootloader, and slightly different buttons but is official still: 
People who get Ledgers usually do so because they want their wallet to hold other coins.  Trezors still do not support the "other" top 10 coins, despite promises that they will eventually.

I'm pretty sure no wallet makes money from fees. You're paying fees to the miners to process and verify your transaction. Some wallets allow highly customized fee-setting. Most do not allow it since noobs will almost always set the lowest fee then panic when their transaction still isn't processed an hour or a week later. If that was a non-segwit transaction (it probably was), I think you paid a decent rate and you're lucky it processed in less than a day. If you want lower fees, you need a wallet that allows customizable transaction rates (and check the mempool before you do it).

China has also told NK that if they make any military action, they're on their own (and although they could match the South Korean army, they wouldn't match the US and other UN forces that would join in).

Yes but zoom out to 4 days and a week and you'll see... this outstanding pool of transactions is even bigger than the pool when this shit started, almost as if people are transferring from their wallets to exchanges in preparation to sell.
Or... of course, also possible that steady hands have been steadily transferring their cheap coins from exchanges to wallets.

I think this is the wrong way to look at it.  If Satoshi is a singular person and he is still watching his Bitcoins, it's more likely that he simply considers his experiment a success: he still owns the same number of Bitcoins.  The fiat value at this point just probably makes him giggle.

It's just too round of a number in Korean currency (US$4362 I think)...
This appears to be a bunch of pre-set sell orders that Koreans have put up for safety probably because they feel BTC can't sustain above this or they want to pull some profit...  What do you call it... a resistance line?  Below that 5 million mark, there are hardly any sell orders and they get eaten pretty quick.  Above that line there are fairly large numbers (probably a few hundred BTC)...
Compare to other charts and (although I admit I only glanced at Bitfinex's USD)... and there is no such weird grouping around such a specific number.  Bitfinex looks like a fairly smooth sideways line almost compared to the weird ups and downs on Bithumb... some people selling for whatever is being offered, I guess... 
Now... if all those Koreans log in and suddenly change their orders and sell at Market Value, we could see a bit of a dip.  There are hundreds of BTC listed on the Bithumb sell book right now (more than there were even just a few hours ago)... Or... they could just remove the sell orders and BTC will break through.

If you're predicting a Korean pump and dump, it's almost always on Saturday in Korea... rarely a weekday.  Saturday 8-10am, if it happens, you'll see some weird spike somewhere on Cryptowatch... then a dump after dinner.  Heh.
Looking at the Bithumb board this week, it looks like a lot of people were trying to do automated short sells during the fall.  I'd think a lot of them got burned with how hard it fell and how quick it bounced.  I'd also like to think the weak hands got out, but I doubt it.  I think we can more expect some Korean action on Litecoin, Ethereum, or Bitcoin Cash in an attempt to bring them back up closer to the pre-crash value... next week or the next...
I think a Korean pump and dump will surely come on the 23rd.  The next weekend begins a major conflux of holidays (10 days off Sept 30 - Oct 9) during which a full 4% of Koreans are leaving the country and the rest of which should be visiting their parents and siblings and taking their kids to theme parks.  That's a full 10 days (including 2 Saturdays) where Koreans will (hopefully) stay away from the market and let it do its thing.

Good answer.  The simplest explanation available.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:36:18
Yes.  If you don't need the money, remember it's part of an investment strategy.  Even the worst reasonable prediction I've seen thinks this will level out at $2200 and reach this point again within 2 years... and I'd rather hold and re-invest more than lock in the loss.  Meh, it's part of my retirement fund.  Bitcoin isn't going anywhere and I can wait it out for years.
Anyways, I suck at predicting rises, I'd probably end up with less coin than I started, like I did last time I had this "sell lowish and re-buy lower" strategy.
So, it may hurt to keep thinking I could have bought 5 for the price I paid for 4... but if I sell now, I'll probably end up with 3.

I'm glad I looked at this thread.  I haven't got nearly that much but pretty close.  I'm thinking of going all-in as well (60%), minus my pension fund (30%)...
It's not FUD when it's true that you should plan for the worst.  $10K in BTC now may go down to $5K or worse next year.  The possibility may be small.  But it's there and if it goes down that badly, it's probably a bust.  I can afford to wait out bad weather.  I've got a stable job, a solid credit card...  But going all in would mean being stuck in this crappy stable job instead of going forward with future plans.
So, although my portfolio is 90% BTC (10% alt), I think I'd be better off balancing BTC with ETH, XMR, or... any suggestions?
And before you ask, let's pretend non-crypto investments are a crappy option or simply unavailable.

This lists under 9 million wallets holding more than 0.001 BTC.  I'd have to assume anything under that will not even be able to clear transaction fees under the current circumstances.
Not sure I'd want to count anything under 0.1 BTC either. They're not worthless but in their current state, they'd lose 5-10% of their holdings just by sweeping them.  I'd bet a lot of those are paper wallets that people have stashed away.
That leaves under 5 million wallets with 0.1 BTC or more.  So, yeah.  That's probably where he gets the number from.  A lot of Bitcoin/Alt-coin traders out there...

Keep reading these posts and you'll see one quote again and again: "time in the market trumps timing the market."
I put in 30% of my life savings last month and watching it's value crumble away for a month.  I laughed as it hit the bottom knowing I should buy as much as I could (not much).  Last week I watched it turn green.  This weekend, I watched it grow.  My plan is it to leave it there for 2-3 years and add a little bit now and then.
Get yourself a Trezor.  Don't leave it on the exchange.  It's been rising all day and there will be a correction coming because it's been rising too fast again.
On the other hand, some people are buying BTC in the anticipation of the fork split.  The more coins you hold at that point (mid-Nov), the more Bitcoin 2X you will get (even if it's basically worthless)...
But Tuesday is coming... Koreans are back from vacation.  It might dip a little tomorrow and then flatline all week.  Who knows after that?
Just make a long-term plan and hold as long and as hard as you can, even when your coins are bleeding.

But still way beyond my ability to understand how they actually work or what makes a cryptography beyond its ability.
As far as I know Bitcoin already got an upgrade for this a few years ago. Wallets previous to that may be hacked (for example the Satoshi coins) by quantum computers. But nobody has done it yet so....

Perhaps less of a sidenote than all the other comments here:
I've met a few IT guys in Korea and asked them what it was like to do programming and other IT work.  Programmers are the lowest in the chain and treated like crap.  It may be supply &amp; demand at work, even they admitted.  There's just too much talent here and too many people willing to take crap salaries.  Throw in the usual Korean work-culture - which if you're not familiar with it - means 50-80 hours in a week (yeah, seriously), "voluntary" overtime (unpaid -do it or you get fired) - and this sheds some light on why $3K / month for a tech company is "expensive."
I work with a guy at my English academy.  He'd rather teach English for 8 hours a day for $2K than go back to programming.  They don't call their own country "Hell Chosun" for nothing.

Some people are under the delusion that GPUs are still cheap and that democratization equals people who don't mind figuring out precise Motherboard-GPU setups, overclocking, undervolting, etc.etc.  I'm under the opinion that the only problem with ASICs is the manufacturers themselves.  There's not enough of them and Bitmain is a thorn in BTC's side.  Democratization = Plug and play (or plug and mine, really).
I like that the IOTA forum promotes small, efficient boxes... you can buy them pre-setup, even.  But IOTA's POW mechanism is a lot different.  If everyone could buy a BTC POW box for $150, that would be awesome...

Probably nothing will happen.  Your coins are safe on your Trezor.  Trezor will probably release a tool to extract the forked Segwit2X coins.  It's best not to hold them on the same address if you ever need to withdraw from that address... of course, pay attention here, get your coins off the exchange (always, even if it's a pittance).
Bitcoin will probably shoot up 10-20 days ahead of the fork, then drop badly afterwards, then come back a week later.
If the other coin by some odds because the main chain of Bitcoin, you already own them because of your Trezor.  And (of course), you can sell them once someone on Reddit (or Trezor) releases a "how to."
So, in short: don't worry.  November's gonna be a helluva ride.  Some people are probably just going to ignore the value and go on with life.  It's better for your blood pressure.

I bought just on the way down after the last All Time High.  Then the China FUD happened.  I HODLed through a 35% loss... and although perhaps it might have been better to sell some as it was going down and re-buy on the pick-up... I didn't.  And I don't regret it too much because I'm 30% over what I spent now.
Take any advice here with a grain of salt.  But all I can say is start slow and if you get stupid and sell lower than you bought it for, it locks the loss, and you'll likely regret it later.
If you're like me and get nervous when BTC dips, get a Trezor and get your BTC off the exchange as soon as possible.  The transaction fee and time alone was enough to keep my hands strong.

The only reason to dump a large number of BTC at once would be to purchase something expensive.  A smart seller would sell 5-10 a day at various price points over a month... which would go completely unnoticed.
Not too many exchanges or banks would happily let you cash out that much at once either. It just looks suspicious.

By the way, this does seem like a good time to buy... or wait and see if the Suicide Tuesday Sale is still going to happen.  The fact that it's not dipping against this sell wall shows some strength.

I can.  Almost anybody can.  It's too easy, though admittedly I'm not satisfied with the fiat-measured losses they have been taking... thankfully I'm 90% BTC.
ARK can bridge blockchains.  That's kind of cool.  Also, miners are voted on by holders.  Not enough support (top 50) and they lose their privilege to mine new coin.  If Bitcoin had that, forks would happen a lot less...
WTC is working on actual practical application of blockchain tech while maintaining it's status as a tradeable coin.  (Unlike say, Ethereum which is being copied and the early investors get squat.)
And my favorite, though it's pretty in theory, not sure how it will end up... IOTA has zero fees and nearly instant transactions.  Every user becomes a node in the Tangle.
Bitcoin has it's strengths, sure, but it's far from perfect.  I think a lot of credit to Bitcoin's strength should go to the masses believing it has strength but it sure helps that a genius or two started it and the Core team isn't reckless.

I think you're slightly wrong but...
Crypto was never banned in Korea.  It had an uncertain period wherein regulations were introduced and policies given to exchanges by the government to enforce.  Mostly this knocked out minors and foreigners (like me, sigh).  The regulations were announced in January and have been in place and enforced since March.  Users who hadn't jumped through the hoops simply had certain options shut off (ie, I can't deposit fiat).
Yeah, the regulations probably had a huge impact on Bitcoin.  It was the lack of regulations and Korean FOMO that probably sent Bitcoin parabolic... the regulations scared the piss out of Koreans and probably contributed to the fall... 
If the Korean Banks were doing the manipulation, they probably fucked up and bought during the panic of February... not exactly in the green, unless they were shorting this entire time.

Oh boy.  This is exactly why people should keep their coins in a private wallet and not on an exchange...
Especially if they're planning on ducking out of the BTC Scene for longer than a few days.  So much can change so quickly.

No targets here, unless you consider time in the market a target.
Right now I'm working and saving for an education that will lead to a career change.  I'm thinking a year or two, maybe three.  I probably won't be able to pay tuition with Bitcoin... but lol, if I can, then great.  But I'll probably need to "cash out" slowly... but hopefully I'll be be able to HODL most of my stash until I retire.

I think it'll happen around 9pm Korea Time (1hr 10min from this post) when Koreans get home from their work... But 10%? Naw. Maybe 3%.
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:54:23
Over here in Korea, I think it's the psychological effect of 7 million won (US$6176).  Every time it passes that point, it dips again for a bit... I suspect this dance above this point will last out at least today: Koreans cashing out, not giving a F about the Fork.
BUT, there doesn't seem to be any major sell walls like there was at 6 million won where at any time 50-200 BTC were for sale.  Now, just little orders of 5-20BTC at random points.  Those could eaten pretty easily...
Yeah the reds and greens are pretty fun to watch sometimes.
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:19:14
Naw.  12 hours ago, the Kimchi Premium was 5%, a sure sign that Koreans were overbuying.  It's back down to a healthy 2%.

Flawed logic.  You can **still** mine BTC from anything with processing power.  It's not profitable, maybe... but that's the point.  The security of Bitcoin is held up by the miners' investment \(electricity and hardware\).  That's what Proof of Work means.  Even before ASICs, it was an arms race: first, the miners with faster CPUs would win more blocks, then when GPU hashing came along, it was the miners who spent more on video cards who won the blocks.  Look at other coins where ASICs haven't been developed...
Satoshi knew that hashing\-power would inevitably go higher... Although nine years ago, we thought Moore's Law would hold and we'd be using CPUs with 64 cores at 100Ghz speeds by now.  An ASIC is in\-line with the tech we're using now: processors that have been designed to handle specific instructions.
In other words, if we revert to CPU mining, we'd still be in an arms race.  Again, look at other coins.  I hate how they've driven the cost of video cards up.  I wish they'd actually build more ASICs.

Win ALTX tokens, which is still in the ICO.
Clicked on the white paper.
"Make perfect what was before just good."
Lol. What a tagline.
Summary?  A multi-crypto wallet, de-centralized exchange, and messenger... built on blockchain technology... errr... what?
Not sure I want my IMs going through a blockchain, anonymous or not... but the de-centralized exchange seems like a noble idea... but then, why ALTX tokens?
There's a lot of vagueness in the whitepaper and not enough details about the coin's utility...

This pulls the basic value from Cryptocompare API, converts it to a usable number.  You can do this with almost any pairing... even USD/CAD/KRW/etc/etc.  Just be sure to change all 3 of the symbols (the last 2 must match).

[ \- this?  A strange way to own Bitcoin.  Your certificates are backed by actual Bitcoin, I'd hope... and more.
Most people here actually own their Bitcoin \(most of it, I'd hope\).. or keep it on an exchange.

Wait for deflation of Bitcoin?  I think you'll have to wait until 2140 when the supply of Bitcoin to miners will dry up.
Maybe you mean appreciation in value?  Buy at the wrong moment and you could be waiting minutes or months.  First, you'll lose money in the trade, then you'll get hit with the withdrawal fee when you put it in your wallet...
OP, I think you don't know what you're talking about.  Go over to and listen to Andreas Antonopoulos here: [

The simple solution?  Open the file with Notepad.  Paste a bunch of text, preferably bigger than what was there before.  Save the file.  Rename the file.  Delete.  This will work at least on FAT\-format disks because the sectors of a file are just reused when saving, wiping the original data.
More paranoid?  Get a simple file\-shredder program.  Same effect as above but... more fun.
Some research has proven that low\-level scanning of the disk can uncover data leftover in the magnetic tracks.  You'd have to be pretty determined to recover an old style HDD this way.
SSDs?  Good question... better be more paranoid...
Disconnect the disk, connect to a desktop, use Minitool Partition Wizard and wipe the partition using a DOD 3 or 7 pass... Probably there are bootable USB Linuxes that specifically can be used for this purpose if you want to just boot from the laptop.
Or you could just go through the hassle of moving your coins to a more secure wallet, making old keys useless.

I'm in Korea and the general opinion as per usual opinion is that cryptocurrencies are speculative investments.  There's the usual mix of HODLers, adopters, tech enthusiasts...
But as a main currency?  Not anytime soon.  
Korea's biggest bill is still only 50,000 won ($50)... supposedly to make it harder to smuggle money out of country.  Foreigners are blocked from deposits on exchanges and using KakaoPay... the government is desperately afraid (as usual) of capital flight... which would be too easy if Bitcoin were considered a currency.
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:33:48
Irritating to see this again even if it's not a repost... is it a re\-blog?
Korea is almost an island for Crypto exchanges now.  During the massive bullrun, the premium was &amp; at its worst.  Lately, it's been sitting at a fairly healthy 1\-2&amp; currently 0.6&amp; but goes into the negative now and then at night.
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:48:22
Well that didn't age well. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:11:46
I'm not bothering to read this but I watch the Kimchi Premium everytime I check my portfolio.  I've seen it swing from \-2&amp; to 5&amp; at most.  It usually sits around 2&amp;  Not nearly as big as the 10\-30&amp; it was during the Xmas Bullrun.  2&amp; isn't bad, I think, for a cryptospace that has been partly cutoff from the rest of the world...
Though I suspect bots are doing a lot of the "arbitrage" work and Bithumb is actually just sitting on a massive stack of BTC they acquired during the bullrun and manipulating prices on their own exchange.
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:05:18
I've noticed something different... straight ups and downs for $100-$200... like someone is trying rek shorters and longers... but the price hasn't essentially changed.
But also, since alts have all been pumping... perhaps there have been big purchases and sales of BTC to get into various alts...
But then again, who knows... this is crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-23 03:57:30
 I think you're looking to put in $10 and pull out $20 kind of thing... and in a week.  Not going to happen, and if it does, you got lucky.  Bitcoin is not a "safe" investment right now.  Those of us who are willing to invest in it are prepared for a long and possibly painful road \(years\).  I've seen my portfolio doubled, quadrupled, sure... but then I watched it go back to where I started.  It is NOT an easy way to make quick money.  So, please... thanks for showing interest in Bitcoin but get over your preconceptions.

Lol.  The housing market is insanely expensive here.  That young Koreans were playing with cryptos so they can get into the bigger game of real estate is not surprising.
The real estate market in Korea has been labelled a bubble for at least 20 years and shows no signs of bursting... but with the birthrate falling, it'll be a slow decline when it does happen.
The "as soon as I break even, I'm out" mentality isn't such a bad thing.  It forces some people into HODL mode.  I wonder how many Koreans bought in during January when the Kimchi premium was 20% and everything was at ATH.  Some of them might be HODLing for a year or 2 to see that again...
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:30:11
...and the Monday Suicide Sale just started.
My theory is that everytime it bumps up, Koreans who were HODLing because they bought it too close to the ATH start to cash out.  It'll increase in spurts, fall, rise again as people catch these sale prices.
Yeah.  Bullish.  But it won't be an easy climb.

Pretty easy to see for yourself.  I think the 30 or 90 day periods are best... I tried 3 search terms that I think "new money" would type into Google... "[Bitcoin]( and "[Buy Bitcoin]( and "[Cryptocurrency exchange]( ...both of these are in downtrends in the last 90 days... not up.
As much as I love Bitcoin, slow steady growth and adoption are better than nutso bullruns that result in collapses that scare noobs completely away from crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:00:24
I keep a Google sheet that compares the % difference between KRW and CAD prices (Quadriga is usually in-line with International exchanges anyway)...
But it'll also show up here:  when the Kimchi Premium goes +/- 5%.  When BTC dips and the Kimchi Premium is in the negative, I buy.  Koreans suck at HODL and are great at FOMO.
@_date: 2017-09-20 03:02:28
I love how "flat" means only shifting up and down a few hunred dollars... This is a good thing.  Relax.  It's gathering steam for the next push.
