It's 19k and beyond... I don't even know anymore. Feels like I'm walking on a tightrope.

I agree that it's still pretty standard, but doesn't really apply much to the white collar yet. More of a blue collar thing at the moment. I'm seeing to the future where the use of "micro" is as common as "dollar".

No government controlled currency, no fuckup by the government.

Seriously, there are so many reasons why the bitcoin wouldn't have been in the wallet. Yet they chose to ignore all those, pretend to be intelligent, and made a smug comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:22:51
Bcash will be the equivalent of "fool's gold" lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:53:08
But then again... People here are repeatedly attacking r/btc
Hate the creator of bcash, don't hate its user. They might not be any wiser.

Damn, 6 years account. You've succeeded in boarding the right train. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:21:48
Gosh... After your comment, someone is gonna post how they cash out and bought 2 happy meal instead of one. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:09:22
One of those crypto price tracker app still has their screen shot of btc at $2k

The best part is you're not investing a lot, so even if you lose it, it's still a good experience learning something new.

Mod can't even be bothered with editing the comment because he has to revisit every other hour.

C'mon, it's a pretty good decision to buy the car.

No much point with having so much asset if you can't enjoy it.
Edit: added italic do make myself look cool 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:01:15
That's the point of cryptocurrency.
But looking at your username, maybe you can ask your relative Woo Der Fuk. He might have an idea.

It'll be pretty interesting to see a reverse chart. All the fiat going down, IT'S AN APOCALYPSE! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:20:25
Wow! That'd a tough situation to handle lol. Not saying that you own them is like lying, telling them you've it and they'll ask endless questions.

Living in Asia, it's time is  0032 right now. Wouldn't be surprise if I wake up to news that bitcoin is ban from several places. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:47
Bubble. When people are afraid of bubble it'll lead to ban, ban of bitcoin *might* mean crashing. But even China and Russia couldn't bring it down... I don't even know what to think anymore

Not sure if anyone mention it to you yet, but from what I read, because of the fact that your phone *might/most likely* is connected to the Internet, there's a small chance that your phone can be monitored while you're receiving the private key.

Thanks for the share, it's always incredible to hear both sides of the story. This post... I'll definitely be doing a lot of thinking about it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:07:05
Was reading at the top like "Yea... Yea... Eh... Yea... Eh.. What?"
Then I saw your comment and felt relieved to know I'm not the only ignorant around here.

Imagine in the future, one of the basic lesson is to teach the meaning of ~~micro and micron~~ milli and micro and it's origin (why the masses have started using these two unit so heavily). 
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:20:41
Really makes me wonder. Even if the "bosses" had not done it, if your employees work long enough to know how the securities operate... 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:43:36
PSA I'm a newbie as well.
Your wallet should have a receive tab, and there's a address there. From coinbase, you can  select "send" and paste the address onto it. But from what I've seen on the Internet, having your coins in a wallet on your phone with Internet connection is a risk.
I'll let the veterans take over though regarding the issue of security. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:25:11
Wary. It's good to be wary with all these bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:23:06
Last month (in fact, less than a month) the global population were still fapping over the news of 10k. This bubble is too crazy.

I'm gonna give the most secure advise (even though i don't even own any virtual currency).
*Invest only if you can afford to lose the money.*
@_date: 2014-01-08 07:54:41
He meant from 2010 to 2014 
edit: ok....
@_date: 2014-01-30 10:39:59
What a nice guy...
