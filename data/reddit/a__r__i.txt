Just keep clicking on the deposit history link on binance.  It will show up within 40-50 mins.   
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:50:46
go to binance, click on BTC deposit and then click history.  should show confirmations there.

send your coins to gdax first and then transfer from there.

If you look at the market caps today: You'll notice 2 things:  1 -  XRP has gone up in a crazy way up to 110 Billion at one point and 2 - BTC market cap has been consistent(the usd value) 228 bilion. 
To me this tells me its dough from dumping other alts and going into XRP.  BTC is holding its 13.8k line beautifully and I think is minimally effected by this. I'm still super bullish for BTC
EDIT: for the record, I am one of those that made a quick buck today with xrp but that doesn't mean I'm dumping my BTC.

gdax down??
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:48:42
that's what this is all about ;)
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:04:23
I just sent some btc from Gdax to binance and it took me around 20 minutes...
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:18:43
I don't really see a significant drop. what do you think?
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:48:46
To anyone thinking people are dumping for Ripple. I assure you that is not the case, if anything BTC has been doing its own thing this whole week, especially in the last two days.  I don't know where the money is coming from, but its not going from BTC to ripple, that would have been reflected in the price of BTC.
