I think it's the uncertainty.
Tomorrow it could be 15k or 8k ... or most likely the same price it's currently at. :) I remember a period of 1-2 yrs (2015-2016) where the price didnt fluctuate much.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:44:34
I have stopped caring as well. (started in 2014) My biggest fear is not buying enough on the dips.
My goal is to sell in 5 to 10 yrs or when I have enough to buy my next house mortgage free.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:14:31
Hodling is tough!!
It's easy to look in hindsight and say I should have bought at 10k once the price is at 15k+. The tough part is that we just dont know what the ultimate low will be and there is a fear that it will eventually crash and we will be questioning ourselves "Why didnt I take some profit or at least pull out my initial investment?"
With that said I highly recommend reading about the tech during the lows. Please keep in mind that even during the lows the dev teams are still working to improve bitcoin/litecoin/etc.
Good Luck.

I am getting the same error.
My guess is a lot of people were trying to sell at 8500 ... not sure how realistic that is as the majority of exchanges are selling for 3-4k. Imagine the arbitrage :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:39:22
Unfortunately i dont think there is much you can do. 
Check this out: 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:31:00
looks like it's been resolved. also the price updated to around 3k. :(
@_date: 2018-09-10 14:15:33
I am doing the same. I am DCA and buying each month. I think what folks are hoping for is that they can buy bitcoin at $6200 and within a couple days it will be worth at least 20k. To put things in perspective if one invests the price of a single bitcoin ($6200) in index funds in the stock market with 8% returns in 10 years you'd have 13.4k. Let's be reasonable with our expectation of bitcoins :)
Also I remember when I was buying 1% of a bitcoin each month and it was costing $200  ... now the same can be had for $62.
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:32:37
There are a lot of us that feel that way. I think there will be massive adoption for blockchain tech and wish there was a way to invest in purely the concept rather then a specific coin.
My biggest fear is that bitcoin, litecoin, etc. is the equivalent of the search engines from the 90s infoseek, lycos, alta vistam etc. The major crypto (aka google in the search engine space) hasnt been released yet or is so small right now that it appears on page 3 of coinmarketcap.com.
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:33:09
It's very hard in real-time to buy when something is falling in price even if you believe in it. (probably all psychological) This time around I am going against that and buying up more bitcoin at the lower price.
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:23:49
I am going with the strategy of buying a little each month.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:44:11
Yeah, there were a lot of folks that bought between 15-20k expecting it to go to 100k or 1 mil and then to sell. Clearly that didn't happen in the timeframe they were hoping. Now they are trying to "limit" their losses. I wanted to go all in as well when we were at a all time high thinking by this time it would be at 50-100k per coin. Fortunately I decided to take the amount i was going to put in and instead decided to invest a little each month.
I remember in Dec/January buying 1% of a bitcoin for $200, now the same 1% can be bought for $62. What a deal!
@_date: 2014-11-16 13:29:21
I am not sure why people are down voting, you guys are actually spending time trying to get merchants to accept Bitcoin. I am guessing many of us on the subreddit bought Bitcoin and are holding out in hopes that someday it will be worth millions. 
I think we should try to encourage these types of op as they are spending the most time/money promoting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-26 12:57:28
100% agree, and then during the next bull/bear run an article will come out that says analyst x predicted correctly during last bear market so they must be correct now lol.
We are seeing this now with the stock market as well with analysts "guessing" when the next recession will be.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:26:15
Thanks, I'll post there.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:42:08
I agree or if any of the major players (amzn, appl, googl, etc) create their own coin. I could see massive adoption as they could easily advertise to their user base and offer some sort of incentive for folks to use it. (sort of like gift cards :( )
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:46:13
Very interesting ... never thought of it that way. 
Yeah paypal, venmo, etc. are thriving.
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:41:06
Do any of the exchanges list it as mBTC yet? That's what we really need.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:39:41
I think we will need the price of bitcoin to stabilize before we can agree on using bits or whatever the preferred domination.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:27:21
I think so also. I will post there as well. I hate to say it but the wording makes me very suspicious whether they are legit. Granted everything on the web says otherwise.
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:44:21
I think what people secretly wish for is that the can buy at 7k while it's worth 18k. Unfortunately doesnt work that way.
I would not be surprised if folks who bought at 20k are selling now in hopes not lose everything, and if it eventually rises again they will be kicking themselves that they didnt hold.
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:38:33
100% agree with you and the OP. I am typically that person.
I've decided that this time it would be different and instead of worrying that BTC is dead, i'd buy more at a 75% discount :) I still believe in the tech and the developers are still working on improving it.
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:59:13
I like this idea. I just hope that the folks who are actually doing something with bitcoin  be it development/promoting/etc. own a significant amount to keep up their motivation.
The last thing we want is for 21 million random people to each own a bitcoin and do nothing with it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:13:25
Great explanation. I feel we need to educate the community so this becomes in people's eyes similar to the nigerian scam that has existed for years. I was tempted to invest until I started reviewing the numbers.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:33:43


I am so sorry. I feel we need to educate the community about these type of bots so more folks dont fall victim. I hate to say it but i can see this service going "out of business" and as we get more adoption they will change the colors of the site and domain and try to scam more folks :(
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:59:30
Very interesting.
I believe there are two possibilities.
1. It actually works. But i find that hard to believe as why wouldnt they invest 10k and make the millions for themselves.
2. Ponzi scheme. My guess is that as long as you take your money out early they will pay to look legitimate.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:48:08
"The price that year went from $1 to $30 — wow! And then it crashed to $3" ... I remember when the price went from $1200 to $200 and through it would eventually disappear. Fortunately i held on to the few bitcoins I had. Unfortunately I still dont see the mass adoption. Most people I speak to have heard of bitcoin but very few own any and still believe it's used to buy drugs :(
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:21:24
Lol, this makes bitcoin look like child's play. I bought a fraction of a bitcoin in March 2014. Spent approx $290 and it's worth approx 3.2k. If i had invested on this site it would be worth 3 million :)
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:31:38
Happy Holidays and thanks for spreading some happiness.
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:46:21
Haha, i remember folks thinking 10k was the absolute magic bottom ... then 7k ... now 4k :)
I want to get into the 1 million club, will soon finally be able to afford to lol :)
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:10:32
I made the mistake of when bitcoin dropped from $1200 - $200 of sitting around and watching. This time around I am going to buy a little each month and then I am working on coming up with a number to sell and no matter what to sell the majority (60-70%) at that number and keep the rest.
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:30:34
I hate to say it but when it was at 20k, a lot thought we would hit within a year 100k. (remember moon math :) ) I wonder if that site still even exists.
If we get to 20k again whether it's next year or several years from now I wonder if at that time folks will again be greedy or actually sell.
I am looking forward to similar posts like we had this time around with a lot of folks trying to recover their wallets ... next time around it will be users trying to recover their login to coinbase or binance :)
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:29:11
Agreed, also if we were guaranteed that the price would go up to 20k everyone would be buying and the price would be instantly higher. There is a lot of uncertainty what will happen next and equally important how long if ever it will recover. I believe in the tech so i keep buying but i dont know if it will be 1 year or 10 years before it recovers.
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:04:42
What is your take that another crypto currency will take over and Bitcoin will fall and never recover. (Ex in search engines Yahoo was King and then google took over)
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:44:34
I was saying the person who invested 5k in bitcoin when it was worth 20k per coin their investment would drop to $350 ... which comes out to roughly 1500 a coin.
Also I wouldnt say it has no chance of getting to 350 ... what happens if google or amazon forks bitcoin or creates it's own currency and it starts being accepted everywhere then the value of bitcoin will crash. It could happen ...
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:08:03
I am hoping it gets to around 1k :)
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:26:37
Unfortunately if it gets to zero, this means some other coin has taken over.
Remember the internet search engine space .... who still uses lycos, infoseek or altavista as their daily search engine  :)
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:15:39
I wonder at what level the meme's will stop at and folks will stop caring. $1000 .... $100 .... .50 cents.
At some point folks accounts will have so low value they will find other things to speculate on :) At that point we will finally have a bull market and the memes will return!
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:00:47
I feel like there is no way to make anyone happy. If it was at 100k right now people would be complaining that they wish they bought at 20k. 
I know many who buy daily/monthly/etc. I am just happy we didnt get to 100k and sat there for months/yrs and then fell to 4k. We should be happy the correction was pretty quick.
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:43:57


This is the first step to adoption. Eventually there will be enough merchants that accept bitcoin that folks wont convert back to fiat. At this time the majority of folks think of value of bitcoin in terms of fiat, and that's due to 99.999% of products being sold/value in terms of fiat. Hopefully that will change one day.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:14:34
I had a similar experience buying around 1k and it dropped to 200 :(
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:14:34

@_date: 2018-11-20 01:16:49
It's funny you say that I have friends that were buying a little with every pay check, now that we have had such a dip they have stopped caring and stopped buying. I dont know anyone that has sold yet, i think they are planning to either get "rich" or lose it all.
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:43:57
I love this graph. It shows that bitcoin at some point "did" hit 19k and we could reach 19k again :)
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:01:13
I am a bit disappointed we havn't see any memes with black friday deals or slickdeals with the various cryptocurrencies. They are at such a discount compared to all time highs.
60% off bitcoin :)
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:40:22
Absolutely. At some point the price will drop so much folks will stop caring. For example someone would bought 5k worth of bitcoin which is a lot for the standard consumer at the height of the market is now worth approx $950 today. That amount may still worth tracking and they will continue posting memes. Imagine if their account worth is $350, at that point they may stop caring. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:31:24
Yeah, you are absolutely right!! It was significantly easier buying on the way up. Remember all the memes with the skeleton of folks waiting for the dip. Guess it didnt take that long :)
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:52:52
Same here, I've seen this boom bust cyle :)
I'll never forget when i was buying on the upward trend similar to how it is now and then it hit $1200 ... and dropped to $200.
The interesting part is back then i could buy a whole coin for $200 and through it was expensive now. i am now buying fractions of a coin for $500.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:24:58
Yeah, exciting times.
I remember in December it costing $200 for 1% of a coin, now the same can be had for around $80. 60% off :)
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:23:40
You are probably right ....
I have a goal to sell them once I have enough to buy a house all cash. I would not be surprised if when i cash out that the price continues to rise. (maybe i'll keep one just in case :) )
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:14:58
Bitcoin Dinosaur is on clearance 60% off. Hopefully we wont see 90% :)
Forkers dont get any ideas.
@_date: 2019-09-05 13:03:15
I feel this is why a lot of folks (I hate to say it) keep their funds on an exchange. They don't trust themselves. And on a exchange while the service may not be great folks like the security of being able to contact someone.
I agree though with the hardware wallet comments.
@_date: 2018-07-11 12:31:14
I wish someone would create a chart with all the past and current predictions and the outcomes.
I feel what happens is that someone makes a correct prediction (while quite a few fail miserably) and then in the future when they make another prediction an article about it is posted.
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:26:07
I rarely make predictions, but for fun i'm going with 6k. I am in it for the long term 10+ yrs.
@_date: 2018-12-01 04:10:10
Unfortunately many banks wont allow you to change money unless you have an account. I asked for the reason at my bank and they said they had to track all the bills going in and out of the bank.
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:04:45
Care to provide an explanation :)
