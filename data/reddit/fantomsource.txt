1. Valid consent requires a **reasonable way of opting out**. All parties to any agreement must have the option to reject the agreement without sacrificing anything to which they have a right.
2. Explicit dissent trumps alleged implicit consent. A valid implicit agreement does not exist if one explicitly states that one does not agree.
3. An action can be taken as indicating agreement to some scheme, only if one can be assumed to believe that, if one did not take that action, the scheme would not be imposed upon one.
4. Contractual obligation is mutual and conditional. A contract normally places both parties under an obligation to each other, and one party’s rejection of his contractual obligation releases the other party from her obligation.

Socialism is stealing from one group of people, under the threat of kidnapping or death, to give to other group of people. In this process both groups become less productive, creative and work capable. 
The state keeps expanding and hijacking services which would be of higher quality and efficiency if provided on the free market in the context of competition instead of monopoly.
Also, socialism has 100% success rate in devastating economies and societies, from Venezuela to Japan, for almost a century now.

I can't fucking believe people are still this stupid.
“Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.”

What are you talking about, are you saying that people who consistently vote for socialist parties are mindless?

I have a feeling that you don't understand that the [very concept of government]( is the problem, not just this particular one at this time.
Also, are you familiar with the term [statism](

Reminds me of IGN and Oculus Rift, their first coverages were sparse, idiotic and dismissive.
Later when it became obvious how much coverage it gets from other outlets and how it will change everything they completely turned around.

Not a big surprise, we already knew [France is communist]( for a long time.
Just a natural progression of things before its inevitable collapse like Greece, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Japan, USA...

Speaking of [licensing]( to feed that tax beast for the perpetual state of war, spying, torturing, [college bubble]( and welfare which [cements poverty]( and addiction to the state.

Constitution is a [rotting carcass](
[Statism]( needs to be destroyed if we are to have a long term, peaceful and prosperous society.

Are you saying that Jaden Smith is not smarter and more involved in his own self-development than the vast majority of  teenagers?
On what planet are you living on?
@_date: 2015-03-19 10:28:52


You fail to understand that the[ statist system]( makes people behave like that. Most people thus are addicted to relegation of responsibility to some authority.

You should read this book, **[American Contempt for Liberty](
It really is bizarre when people malign libertarians, like stealing and being violent is preferable, do they even know what they are saying?

Exactly, but she was [never a libertarian]( in practice.
@_date: 2015-03-12 12:02:16
Only thing we need to deal with now is tax theft so we can finally bring the horrid [statism]( down.

WWII was a direct consequence of how the WWI ended, which was directly set up as it was(protracted and brutal) by communist central banking.
The only specific thing about WWII was the infusion of semitic hatred, nurtured for centuries by the Catholic church.

Naive about what, what are you talking about? Have you ever actually read a serious book about austrian economics or NAP philosophy?
Maybe you should [watch this video]( first, I was somewhat like you many years ago before I got properly informed. All the facts and ethics are on the libertarian side.

Tom Woods is actually a [libertarian anarchist]( as anyone in their right mind should be.
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:51:11
So sad to see that [tax theft]( will continue unhindered through bitcoin.
More wars, more irrational devastating welfare, more torture, more spying, more communist central banking to destroy economies.

The refuge crisis will cost EU 30 billion Euros at least in the first year.
Thanks to terrorist rogue state USA that is in the business of funding islamic butchers.

Fluoridating is a good thing because it reduces tooth decay, wtf are you talking about, are you a complete moron?
As for [central banking](
