Agreed. Futures will serve to decrease some vol as well
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:34:04
Exactly. Looks like it holding up pretty good so far, can’t say I’m terribly surprised tho. Kinda funny that we’re not seeing a major flood into short positions. So much for all those guy putting their money where their mouth is. If I had a dollar for every time someone on TV or someone I run into says “if I could short BTC I’d do it so fast”. To that I say, good luck and proceed with caution. If the tear upwards isn’t up anyone who does have the balls to short it will get supremely

Every day is a new ATH. It’s always a good time to buy bitcoin :). That being said, we’ve had a savage run up, we’ll have a little correction in the near future I’d suspect.  It has the potential to be worth 10s of thousands or hundreds of thousands each, do u really care that u paid $7000 instead of $6000. All depends on your investment thesis, timeframe and strategy tho. Me===&gt;hodler

Well seeing as BTC is the reserve currency for all cryptos I’d say this is a very positive development. Anyone ever thought that the only reason smart money hasn’t been buying in is because there isn’t an easy way for them to do it? Now they can buy all they want ;). Even if it’s only 1% of their total port. that’s huge money on the sidelines. BTC to the moon! Next stop 15k.

I think there are more than a few factors going on here. CME is very bullish as is people buying to take advantage of “free money” from the airdrop. What’s certain is post fork is a mystery right now. We got people preaching BCH as the instant replacement. Could go 1x or 2x or BCH. Speculation is futile. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:57:10
It’s politics, they shoot themselves in the foot by taking a side publicly, by leaving their options open they remain neutral and allow the market to make the decision. As it should.

U should get the price u initiated at  same boat I’ve been calculating by hand. Bought at 5800, still waiting for it to clear. All I care about is that it’s cleared by Nov 16 so I can get that air drop����

It is because of this video that I have no problem hodling through this craziness. BTC isn’t going anywhere.

Met Preston (one of the founders of the Podcast) at the Berkshire meeting this year. Great guy! Highly recommend the TIP podcast. They’re also the ones who got me interested in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:00:37
Don’t u think exchanges should remain neutral tho? The users and the market will determine the fate of BTC, by remaining neutral they’re allowing exactly that. Exchanges have no place taking sides in such things. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:23:31
How? Are I implying that by not condemning 2x they agreed with it?

Shits going straight up until the fork. Then, anyone’s guess...

Totally agree, sure is fun to be petty tho :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:50:49
Haha they just well might. I specifically remember them both talking about how their secret to success is to always continue to learn. 
The issue with Bitcoin, recently experienced by myself, is u have to commit some real time to learn about it. It’s not easy to grasp but if u take the time to understand it, there’s definitely an “oh shit” moment. All I hear these days is fiat currency this, quantitative easing that, everyone knows we need a solution but no one has one. The “oh shit” moment is when u realize BTC could be the solution and the timing couldn’t be better. Argentina on a massive scale
Also, schedule permitting, I’ll be back for round 2 next year at Berk!

@_date: 2017-10-23 20:13:33
Haha thanks! My mistake. It’s definitely litecoin
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:18:51
The support page on Coinbase says they’ll match whatever BTC balance u have with B2X after the fork. You’ll have both, so u can just wait to see which one ends up “winning” as it were. It should be pretty clear which one people prefer by the end of the year. 
My only question is how long does it take before u have the B2X coin credited. They make it seem like it’s instantaneous but I’ve heard people are waiting on their B gold and will be for awhile. Anyone have any ideas about this? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:06:03
It may be closer than we think. Many are calling this current economic environment the “everything” bubble or the “central bankers” bubble. Once it pops it will be the first one where people don’t look to the central banks for, support, confirmation that everything is ok because they’ll realize it was their loose monetary policies that caused the bubble in the first place. We’ll then be in search of a safe, inflation proof, decentralized alternative, cue Bitcoin. Total speculation but one can dream. BTC to $1,000,000. It’s impossible for a government to outlaw it and with current tech u can literally download the main chain from anywhere in the world providing u have a $100 satellite and a solar panel. Whaaat!? It’s gonna change the world. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:02:32
Not like u can’t still use BTC in Indonesia, just slightly less convenient now. Perks of decentralization ;).
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:21:27
That’s because Warren doesn’t understand it. And has made little effort to. Ask him about Amazon, he’ll tell u the same thing lol
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:01:11
Yeah I’d take most stuff with a grain of salt. The following started as an anti-government, establishment transaction method. A lot of the people on here are the ones that would also tell u to put all your money under a floor board so Uncle Sam doesn’t get it haha. Bitcoin still isn’t mainstream enough to transcend zealot like, anti-government and establishment folk.  
The best advice I could give is to really understand it yourself so u can make decision on your own and have the ability to filter through the BS on here. Much of it is, there’s a lot of good stuff too but u have to know enough to be able to separate those who know and those who don’t. A really good place to start is a book written by a few people at Princeton. It’s called “Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technology”. U can download a draft from the 2015 class off their website for free. Just google the book. It’s about 300 pages and pretty dense but once you’re done you’ll have a very solid understanding of BTC and how everything around it works. Then u can make an intelligent decision on your own. You’ll have an understanding of the risk (or lack there of) that you’re taking by doing one thing over the other. It will also likely open your eyes to how truly profound this technology is. It’s going to change the world in the near future.  
Long story short there are several ways to store BTC, one is through an “exchange”, such as Coinbase, and another is a wallet. I suppose u could use the comparison of a checking account VS a savings account (exchange being the checking account). With an exchange u don’t own a specific coin, u have the rights to a certain amount based on what you’ve deposited. Just like how a bank doesn’t sit on the money u deposit to them. In the exchange it’s very liquid but if the exchange gets hacked or they are malicious ur fucked, where as in a wallet u physically control the coin. 
It’s nice to keep some money in the checking account (exchange because it’s very liquid and gives u the ability to spend it, pay bills) but u wouldn’t want to keep your life saving in there because if u lost your wallet someone could drain real money out of your account using your check card. A good strategy is to keep some in the Coinbase account for liquidity and then move the majority to a wallet as a long term, safer solution. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:45:09
I’m right there with u man. I see no reason to move anything out of Coinbase at the moment. You’ll have both coins, suppose if u had all of your net worth in BTC u might want to take different precautions but I have a very minimal position at this point and am fine trusting Coinbase with it. To each his own, but I feel like people on this sub blow the actual risk of using it way out of proportion.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:04:43
Couldn’t agree more. Could careless about the miners. I see how that could have read pro miner tho. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:32:49
Ultimately I think this decision may end in the miners shooting themselves in the foot. The ONLY reason to implement 2x is to allow for more fees to be collected so it’s obviously an entirely selfish move on their part. My understanding is Bitcoin was built on the idea of mutual collaboration. This throws a pretty big wrench in that. Huge blow to credibility. Everyone likes to hate on all the other cryptos because they allow stuff like this to happen, we use to brag about how BTC was above that and likely why it will win the crypto race. That narrative will be called into question with the execution of 2x — it’s essentially a 51% attack. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:00:13
Gotcha makes sense. Don’t carry your life savings around in there. Just a little cash for liquidity, daily purchases. Did some more research and I think I’m going to open a GDAX account instead. Way lower fees, better interface and charting software. Does that have the same security considerations as Coinbase? I know they own GDAX. So u have no private key in that case either? So it would be better to store most cold and leave a bit in GDAX? My understanding is once u have your address for the cold storage u can send BTC anytime u want to it and once the cold storage reconnects is makes the adjustment. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:30:47
No problem, the Princeton one isn’t an easy read either but I think it does a pretty good job. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:11:42
Happy to please ;). How would u describe it? In a less convoluted way
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:06:57
SegWit worked. We have lightcoin and the ability to make transactions off chain and then send them to the chain consolidated as one transaction. Doesn’t this eliminate the need for the 2x part? My understanding is the 2x part will increase the size of a block from 1mb to 2mb, giving the ability to handle more transactions. But if we do all the transactions off chain with light coin and consolidate later there’s no need for the extra space because the main chain will continually be freed up due to people making transactions off chain with light coin. Now the miners could benefit from 2x because each block will be able to support more transactions and thus produce more opportunities to charge fees. Bottom line, I see no reason to implement 2x now that light coin is live and working as it was designed. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:19:42
2 things create value, scarcity (21m cap) and the service it provides. Bitcoin is a way to safely (and anonymously if u so choose) transfer any amount of money to any person or entity in the world. It gives u the ability to become your own bank. It can’t be hacked (at the least the main chain hasn’t ever been) and because it’s decentralized no one government or state can control it/outlaw it. 
Example: Bill is worth $100m and he would like to give $50m to his son, internationally. Currently this is a large undertaking, that would take weeks and cost thousands of dollars in fees. With Bitcoin, Bill can send the $50m from his pocket whenever he wants and his son can receive it, for free. Elimination of the middle man. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:39:22
Prior to segwit they were collecting higher fees because the blocks were so swamped with transactions that the highest bidder (transaction fee) got their transaction processed. It was a natural development that benefited them. They were opposed to segwit because it decongested the main chain and thus lowered the fees they collect because people weren’t fighting over their transaction being picked up anymore. The 2x part was a second solution to this congestion problem (2mb blocks as opposed to 1mb). Obviously a larger block can support more transactions and thus allow for more fees to be charged (even if the fee is less than before, the volume is higher). Segwit takes most transactions off chain so in addition to shafting the miners on most transactions being executed after implementation it also frees up the main chain. There’s no reason to increase block size to 2mb if most transactions aren’t even executed on it anymore. Bottom line, segwit worked better than expected and removes the need for 2x entirely (at least for now). Segwit hurt and not implementing 2x is another blow.

The full nodes actually download the full main chain as well. Where the lightweight nodes only grab the header. Think desktop vs smartphone.

Can u not store your Bitcoin on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:50:02
From Coinbase Support, my question is, how long will it take for them to credit u? Is it instant?
“What action do I need to take? Do I need to withdraw my funds from Coinbase to have access to B2X?
No action is required on your part. All Coinbase users with a BTC balance at the time of the fork will automatically be credited with an equal balance of B2X.”
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:36:16
I’ve heard someone speculate about 2 or 3 major cryptos being the end game. BTC being reserved for big transactions (house, car) and something like Ethereum being used for most other small daily transactions. That seems like the most likely scenario at this point. But who knows lol. Bitcoin can definitely handle mass adoption.
