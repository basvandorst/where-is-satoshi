Yeap. That’s why I summed up all in the title.

I see thanks. When I buy bicoin on my own I won’t ever use Xapo. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:59:31
I see that explains it. Thank you.

I say actions speak louder than words. 
He always called bitcoin a scam. But in the end he used his money to invest on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:56:34
No idea man. I am new to this.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:53:24
I see. I just cheked and they fore you to pay .00077247 for a “standard fee” or .00116478 for a “high priority” as stated on their offical site.
It seesm like Xapo is overcharging their service. Thanks for the heads up. I will use other wallet instead.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:00:23
You mean receiving bitcoins should be free?
Wow Xapo is a piece of shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:34:55
I use taringa a latin american site in spanish that pays people with bits for writting. But it forces us to use Xapo to receive money. And Xapo is charging 12 dollars per transaction.
I guess this is a Xapo issue and not a bitcoin issue. I hate that wallet so much

I see thanks

Well I didn’t know that... geez. I’m just learning this stuff.
Xapo is  a POS.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:57:04
Asking people that do know is my way of doing research... like asking here.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:32:17
That wuld be awesome. But the xapo guys are charging me that. And I’m using xapo against my will. The place that pays us with bitcoin Forcees us to use xapo.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:30:57
Sadly I didn’t choose Xapo. The page that pays me in bits forces us to use Xapo against out will.
We have complained.... but they don’t want to change it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:58:04
I see. I learned a lot. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:33:03
Thanks... Guess Xapo is worse of an scam than i thought.
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:20:19

Hey there, would you mind sharing a link to it.
I only get bits from a site called taringa and I don’t know much about this
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:29:08
...but sure I wanted to ask a real human being.
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:45:25
Thank you!
