You don't need a finite number for scarcity to exist.  You just need to have to have the level of demand keep equal to or ahead of the supply.
Additionally, you may consider that Bitcoin will be mined for a hundred years, so in all likelihood it will be inflationary throughout your life time, just like dogecoin.  Anything after you're dead won't have much of an impact on you.

Absolutely, OP makes a really good point about email verification and a country lock.  Coinbase could have prevented this theft and any similar kind of theft.  If they claim to be offering bitcoin to the masses the onus is on them to foresee solutions to these kinds of thefts.

You don't need to resort to name calling.  Not only is it demeaning, your word choice kind of reflects back to why women have been speaking negatively about their treatment at bitcoin events.
Also, if you can't understand that people are different and that they have personal motivation to see and do things in many diverse ways... well you might want to consider opening your mind up and accepting people for who they are.  Whether it is about the coin they choose or how they choose to involve, use, and promote their cause/idea- it is their personal choice.
You are vitriolic towards dogecoin (a non-centralized community) for their PR and saying bitcoin shouldn't be like that.  As a member of doge's community I agree the individuals who form their subreddit need to put some further thought in how they're perceived.  **However that doesn't remove the fact that after reading your post I see a guy who is into bitcoin who comes off as insulting and angry instead of achieving the point about positive self-image he is trying to make.**

I'm pretty sure you would get major media attention for a 20 bitcoin prize for best bitcoin video.  Between the video developed and the press about the contest, it would be a real boon to r/bitcoin and bitcoin in general.

I would heavily encourage working with friends and contacts of yours to trade direct, get the btc into the hands of loved ones.

Ideas thus far:

Andreanopoulos said that bitcoin is like digital cash.  But it's not.  It's like digital gold.  Dogecoin is the digital cash with it's lightly deflationary currency.  People want to use their cash, and hopefully have it gain in value, but definitely not lost its value.  People want to hoard their gold in order to long term store its value.  Different functions and different usages.  I think it is inevitable for some similar concept to develop in cryptos.  A bit of it is the psychology of the human mind, and how it views investments.
Additionally, something to consider is the regionalized adaptation of cryptos.  Something that we will probably see in the next 5 years.  Who says that Brazil and Argentina are going to choose the same crypto(s) of interest as say Estonia, and Finland, or Singapore and Malaysia.  The likelihood of roughly bordered world crypto-regions is in my mind fairly high at this moment.  Also, the tradeability between currencies will likely stay rather simple in most regions.
You could also have the potential for sector based currency adaptation.  Maybe  medical facilities will adapt with bitcoin, whereas you can buy your nike's with doge.  The anecdote of the bitcoin dentist that mentioned in this thread hints at the likelihood of this occuring.  Casual shoppers and generally fun loving people are likely to adopt a consumer marketed currency.
Wow.  By this logic Dogecoin is the proletariat's crypto.

They also banned reincarnating within their border without their permission.

Argentina has been having a lot of trouble staying afloat economically.  Their currency is a bad investment across the board, everyone knows it, you lose money in your check to inflation between the time you start working and the time you get payed.
There is a huge demand for US dollars, and most wealthy Argentines keeps their money in USD in Uruguayan banks.
The government has instituted price fixes on grocery stores and on the currency exchange.  dolarblue.net shows the blue dollar (what people trade at) and the official value.
Present day
 Blue is 10.8pesos to 1 USD
White 6.7 to 1

Blue was 6 to 1

Make sure you enable 2fA for the account and for withdrawals.

They also need to [improve their security.](

[I saw this Coinbase security thread a few days ago.]( Just be warned that you're pretty much screwed if your account is compromised.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:32:43
I'm not sure if it is, I just read and commented on a post about a user who got phished on coinbase. They made some very valid points about lack of security features on the site.

If you really want to increase your volume, go check in with Argentine Vineyards.  They have a lot to gain by processing their international merchant orders with bitcoin.

This makes me wonder if Etherium will eventually be the first artificial intelligence (besides google, of course).
@_date: 2014-02-04 05:51:48
Also more likely to see large purchases with bitcoin for things such as houses and real-estate.  Though this is my best educated guess, i'm no expert psycho-historian (guesser of the future).

Bitcoin also outsurvive failed governments.  They will be the new "safe" goto currency in the future for collapsing monetary systems.  Look at the cyprus bubble of 2012 for instance.  Any time you have a fiat currency collapse, it is almost guaranteed that folks will buy bitcoin and gold.  The problem with gold is it is physically stuck where you are, while bitcoin has internet access.
