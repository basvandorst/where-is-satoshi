How are we so sure about this?
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:30:21
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:04:59
This sounds like a great advice, but I think I will eventually buy a Ledger. Thank you so much
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:35:34
Just keep on buying satoshis
@_date: 2019-07-24 11:35:09
Let's say the US, for example
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:32:08
Have you tried MyCellium? That one is great as well
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:44:34
Agreed my man
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:18:52
Already on it. Just curious how is going to develop
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:50:04
That sounds great
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:41:19
I really have to learn a lot more since I don't know what Dojo or Whirlpool is. Can you get me a quick explain?
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:56:27
I have been using it for a while and I really liked it. What pissed me off the most is that they don't do the conversion from the Bitcoin you are sending to the USD value it's worth at the moment, but now I love that feature
@_date: 2019-07-23 08:35:15
Am I the only one reading this kind of shit?  [
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:32:56
What about mobile wallets? Are those safe? I am currently using Samourai, but I have tried MyCellium as well
@_date: 2019-07-13 22:33:39
Thanks for your answer, it was really helpful!
@_date: 2019-07-23 08:35:23

@_date: 2019-07-10 20:30:58
Sounds great to start. Better late than never I guess
@_date: 2019-07-12 14:17:02
Sorry, I'm little bit mentally retarded
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:18:07
So a ledger is used to totally hodl?
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:44:45
Great answer. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2019-07-12 11:57:55
It really is a struggle for me since I am constantly checking the charts, but you gotta keep your hands strong. Hodling is the only way my friend.
@_date: 2019-07-23 08:34:52

@_date: 2019-07-24 11:23:05
The Old Town Road parody is also great
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:22:48
Yeah, I'll probably have a hardware wallet to save Bitcoin and then a mobile wallet as 'cash'. By the way, what mobile wallet do you recommend?
@_date: 2019-07-22 10:03:39
But just for pc, right?
@_date: 2019-07-22 10:03:56
Not at all, nothing about a mobile app. Just the PC version
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:22:01
This sounds like the thing I'll be doing. Thanks
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:33:11
What about mobile wallets? Are those safe?
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:36:36
You can reuse it.
@_date: 2019-07-24 08:08:48
Maybe you won't have to buy it with fiat. The best possible outcome is that you will get paid in Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:53:52
I really like crypto music. Yours was great
@_date: 2019-07-19 18:53:51
Alright, I'll rephrase, is it a good strategy?
@_date: 2019-11-05 13:22:10
Yup I saw that too. Moving out is not an option
@_date: 2019-11-18 08:54:10
I know about crypto, not about trading
@_date: 2019-11-05 09:59:58
Cool, the Bitwage looks like a great option. Thanks man
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:12:27
I think I get it. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-11-26 22:12:35
Thanks a lot man
@_date: 2019-11-01 23:28:45
I tried running a node on a raspb, but I ended up with nothing due to an error when transferring the blockchain from my pc to the hdd
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:02:19
I'll take a look into that
@_date: 2019-11-10 16:23:54
" /mnt/hdd/bitcoin/blocks/rev01310.dat: open for write: received failure with description 'Failure' Error: File transfer failed " Only God knows wtf this means

Ya decía yo jajajajajajaja
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:19:46
Sounds great tbh. And BitWage keeps nothing?
@_date: 2019-11-18 08:56:27
I already have a hardware wallet. It's not the first time I buy bitcoin, but I was trying to get charged less fees. Thanks a lot btw
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:55:57
Cool, does he use BitWage?
@_date: 2019-11-27 21:13:44
Yup, I read that!
@_date: 2019-11-27 21:02:07
Yeah I thought that too, but I've been asking myself: aren't there cryptos with better characteristics than Bitcoin in some fields? Idk I just feel like Monero or Litecoin could be used for some things and Bitcoin for others. 
I must also say I currently only own Bitcoin, because I don't know shit about the other ones, that's why I am asking!
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:42:19
I am no expert at all, but rn everything below 9k would be pretty good to me. I'd buy now!
@_date: 2019-11-05 09:28:37
Bitcoin es superior en muchos sentidos a los bancos, solo queda que la gente se de cuenta de eso.

Yeah, you got a point there

Cool man, thanks

What the fuck is Bitcoin Rutal
@_date: 2019-11-27 08:26:29
Thanks a lot for the guide through man, but why is everyone hating on Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-11-05 09:33:22
We don't know for sure if the price will pump. For all we know it could become unprofitable for miners to mine and the hashrate could drop, right?
@_date: 2019-11-18 08:43:32
I have no idea wtf is CFD's. But is it safe to buy from, for example, Coinbase and then transfer that to my hardware wallet?
@_date: 2019-11-10 16:13:39
It was in the last final fucking step, I had everything set up and I only had to transfer the blockchain from my computer to the raspi hdd. But in the mid it gives me an error
@_date: 2019-11-22 08:57:20
What satoshi said or did is no longer or business. He is not here anymore and now Bitcoin will be what we can build out of it
@_date: 2019-11-10 18:58:12
I'd love to read your review once you have finished building your node. It would be great if you could keep me posted, that'd be fantastic
@_date: 2019-11-27 08:43:52

Cool, is it in Spain? There are many like those here
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:00:52
So, in order to use Bitwage, my employer needs to sign up?
@_date: 2019-11-10 14:53:25
Not really, I'm guessing they loud af
@_date: 2019-11-27 08:23:35
I don't understand, why?
@_date: 2019-11-10 16:22:40
Over network, let me look for the exact error
@_date: 2019-11-09 23:17:08
Oh shit, I had no idea. I saw it on Twitter, sorry!
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:53:04
I mean, I have many ways to get Bitcoin, but this one lets me get paid in btc
@_date: 2019-11-28 20:08:33
I don't know, I tried using coinbase and it kept giving me an error
@_date: 2019-11-27 21:10:58


Yeah, that's why I only have invested in BTC.
I read this article about the economic point of view and I had some questions:  [ 
It would be cool if you had time to read that small article and give your insight of it

Hey Jasper, I am coming to the conclusion you are a real asshole. Why don't you stfu for a while?
@_date: 2019-11-27 08:24:54
I don't use any of that, when I buy Bitcoin I directly transfer it to my hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-11-08 08:10:37
BitWage, it asked me for my wallet address to send my funds
@_date: 2019-11-19 21:58:29
Congrats man, may I ask how did you do it?
@_date: 2019-11-30 15:34:22
Fuckkk why no one opens this kind of shit in Madrid instead of fucking Vigo
@_date: 2019-11-08 08:04:04
So I just use address and all as normal BTC?

Don't you think some coins have better things than in Bitcoin in some aspects? Like Monero in the privacy aspect?
@_date: 2019-11-16 13:41:52
Thanks man, exactly what I was looking for
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:16:50
If I am not wrong, the Bitcoin Core has been one of the very first wallets. 
How did you get those btc?
@_date: 2019-11-18 09:01:53
exactly, I don't know much about exchanges and trading
@_date: 2019-11-05 21:11:37
Fucking great, thanks for the response man

then, they are surely lost, aren't they?

Early adopters will be rewarded.
@_date: 2019-10-28 14:41:04
You can buy Bitcoin with your credit card and then launder them
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:13:12
I was thinking the exact same thing today. Lost Bitcoin scare the shit out of me. And while inflation being out of the map is a huge relief, deflation is a pretty serious issue as well
@_date: 2019-08-27 20:59:34
No worries man
@_date: 2019-10-04 07:04:42
But the opening and closing channels thing does not seem like a good idea either
@_date: 2019-10-03 14:37:31
Can you direct me to a tutorial to Dojo?
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:32:56
It was not sitting, I made a transaction a few days before doing the recovery

The thing is I only have tried to recover my wallet when it had 0 btc, because I didn't want to lose anything. So when I entered the seed I had my wallet with 0 btc, but I couldn't see the transactions I made in the past. Anything weird with that?

Can you dm, please?
@_date: 2019-10-18 07:28:51
I mean, it does. When you first install the app it asks you whether you want to create a new one or recover one. The thing is I only have tried to recover my wallet when it had 0 btc, because I didn't want to lose anything. So when I entered the seed I had my wallet with 0 btc, but I couldn't see the transactions I made in the past. Anything weird with that?

Just go here  [ and try out some rigs. I think whichever you choose is profitable. How long will you be living there?

I tried MyCellium and Samourai, and between the two, the last one has a more simple UI and features like VPN and TOR
@_date: 2019-10-10 07:53:16
To be honest, I have no idea. Never mined, nor thought of doing it because electricity in my country is expensive af. So, can't help you anymore. Good luck man

same here tbh

@_date: 2019-12-24 19:04:37
It is not easy to set up a bank account either. I don't think the complexity of using Bitcoin is the biggest problem.
@_date: 2019-10-05 16:34:31
I'd say between now and the end of the year, since the halving is on May.
@_date: 2019-10-05 11:05:20
At this point, that's no longer an option
@_date: 2019-12-19 12:21:40

How do you do that?
@_date: 2019-12-24 11:36:28

Exactly what I was looking for, thanks a lot!
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:48:25
In my honest opinion man, I think it would be more profitable for you to just buy Bitcoin. Mining with a  GTX 1080  is no longer possible, but I am no expert.
