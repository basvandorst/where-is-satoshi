I don’t debate any of that, I’m not defending the current order. 
suggesting it can be replaced without world power trade wars to protect American global financial absolutism exposing the currency to all of its obvious inefficiencies is more what I’m getting at
If America lost these wars creating a replacement climate for currencies or w/e I’m not sure any certain currency can be predicted or current ones not ready to kill billions of people considered bubble proof or third world economic institutions compared to that kind of power backing
I’m not pushing back really more than assuming someone much much smarter than me has already written about this and there is a wiki on it. I’ve never researched anything past a facile level. Struggling to word any of this to my satisfaction as is lol

genuine question, do you think fiat currencies will collapse without a world war?
weimar republic's currency wasn't backing all of europes money as its standard and guaranteed for oil sales. 
there is a unique scale of absolutism that will play here in regards to USD and american forced backing of it
edit: and if so, isn't the most likely conclusion USD appropriation of blockchain technology undercutting any replacement currency out of its jurisdiction (that it some reason would continue to allow)

Gold is a highly malleable electricity conductive pretty-looking material object. it has thousands of important real world uses in hundreds of industries that gives it inherent value in the material world even before cultural affinities for it looking good. it's also not backing currencies anymore.
it just wasn't arbitrarily given value, if we all get blasted into cavemen tomorrow, gold will be a high valued resource to have for becoming some golden speared tribal warlord and the 5 people left who will understand electricity stuff

they're playing dirty af and it's disgusting. that's usually the winners in the marketplace. lol
