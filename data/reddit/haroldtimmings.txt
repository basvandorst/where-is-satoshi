I believe many go after being banned here, banning will generally occur if you disagree with core or their roadmap. I think forums should have been a neutral space where ideas and implimentations duke it out together it might have been ugly and raw but should have avoided a split with sides being taken.

The reality is Greg is the reason Bitcoin development is splt so less of his presence here on Reddit is a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:14:33
 Greg exists on a mental plateaux above most of us if you find his analogy horrible it is basically because it goes over your head. Imagine for a moment Greg spoke immense pearls of wisdom using only binary code your response - horrible, again only horrible because you can't understand it. Get it?

This is why we need to seriously consider moving away from this broken decentralised model. We now have enough bitcoin companies within the space that could host copies of the full ledger, overnight we could render chinese miners obsolete saving vast amounts of electricity in the process. coinbase bitpay blockstream operating ledger hubs or Lou Chin running a mining farm out of his uncles football factory?

The reality core was here first we made enemy's with those who wanted a blocksize increase (and told them to go away and make their own altcoin) they made xt,classic,BU, now we can't get segwit activated as Bitcoin development is split. However we want to sugar-coat this we wanted to get our own way more than keep the community whole. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 15:01:56
Sooner we can get to fully operational LN hubs and get rid of these dumbstruck Chinese miners the better. We need to crown lukejr as benevolent dictator preferably do this before the lifeless carcasses of the Chinese miners roll over into mr vers pocket.

Below is a quote from a litecoin dev that is working on segwit integration this at least shows there is a grey area surrounding segwit as a blocksize increase but maybe not a long term scaling solution
   
"I legitimately get more and more stressed every time I say this to someone. SegWit is not a block size scaling solution. SegWit would allow the implementation of Lightning Networks and Confidential Transactions. With LN we would be able to work on things like atomic swap txs, when you could seamlessly transact Litecoin on the Bitcoin network. And that's just the start."

We are all extremely fearful of a hard fork, this is why just maybe bu might be better taking the lead for a while that's one thing about bu supporters they have little or no fear in the face of hardforks. It's like a battle you don't bring your most fearful soldiers to the front at best they might run off at worst they spread their fear throughout the whole advancing army. we've sort of overplayed our fear hand a little which I think has caused the whole Bitcoin movement to freeze.

Anti-core types who seem to have an issue with the way we run Bitcoin, it doesn't take a genius to know mr ver wants to take theymos's crown away hence he started rbtc &amp; BU.

Benevolent dictator, head of litecoin strategic planning Charles lee approves this message  
 
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:54:54
most here are hodlers who probably never use the network at all ths is why it's so odd when people talk about a delayed transaction. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 11:51:14
Did coblee come up with this or another litecoin dev? 
@_date: 2017-02-14 14:42:47
I'm scared about big blocks very scared, hard forks whether they be controversial or not terrify me. I'm anxious about the node count, spam and competing implimentations. Low fees that can't support the network as miners subsides are reduced keep me awake at night, high fees make me tense and irritable . I'm freaking out about decentralisation, Chinese miners colluding the PBOC banning. Backlogs, blockchain bloat, delayed confirmations are giving me ulcers. Is the answer segwit or a psychiatrist ?
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:47:58
We all understand the narrative that litecoin is a joke, I think it will be interesting if litecoin gets segwit &amp; LN, especially if we find this core/BU implimentation split continues to slow Bitcoin development.  
@_date: 2017-02-20 08:26:51
Satoshi is either  back, theymos, maxwell, lukejr........ Hint : there's a popular saying newbs probably are unfamiliar with " one needs a good back to have a strong core " 
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:12:03
do we actually know who this litecoin dev is that came up with UASF? Maybe this should be atempted first on LTC's network before Bitcoin runs with it. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 15:59:04
I thought BU was a positive thing ? 
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:38:27
Just a heads up guys, we hate coinbase due to Brian armstrongs anti core stance. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:51:51
This is great finally we can move ahead without ver holdings us hostage let them keep Bitcoin with all it's Nakamoto baggage, small fees and large block-space we can then move ahead with a truly high fee settlement layer structure, I propose we rename to settlecoin or maybe corecoin. When ver's Bitcoin starts sinking we don't want any brand confusion. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:59:14
Bitpay knows where it is at, I can see oil fields being bought and sold via bitpay and $100 to $1000 fees becoming the norm. Work is underway for Charles lee's litecoin to be bitcoins sister currency handling the pesky low value low fee payments. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:19:31
And blames theymos for spitting the community lol
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:53:19
We want $99 fees not $9, without the fee market we would have had every 3rd world country using Bitcoin paying cents per transaction filling up blocks causing chaos. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:40:02
This scaling debate has relied on manipulating the majority of Bitcoiners who will be the first to admit they rarely if ever use the blockchain (coins never leave coinbase wallet) and for the most part are  generally avarage or low intelligence this is why it was plain sailing to make them scared out of their tiny minds about hardforks, competing implimentations and small fees. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:49:49
We basically follow the majority which is core, in the unlikely event that changes and BU becomes the majority then most if not all will support BU. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:04:50
Forget about Gavin, maxwell deserves to lead Bitcoin forward as many consider him to actually be Satoshi as for his over inflated ego and inability to worth with others this comes with the territory when you have genius in your veins a little like Satoshi used to be. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:04:46
Unfortunately we behaved like that kid in the playground who hogged all the toys. Maybe theymos core and blockstream employees could go on a course to learn how to work together and unite the community they are clearly going to have to learn how to share now and let BU play with the toys. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 08:16:42
This highlights that there is something really wrong at the heart of core governance that an implimentation can gain so much traction with only a couple of devs. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:07:33
Go away cesspool dweller you and your sort are not welcome here .....Exponential fee growth, he's hiring and positively loving it !I bet with bitpays large transactions he could easily afford $100 fees, can someone do some figures on what bitpays fees will be in 6-12months at current rate. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:41:25
Do we actually know for sure that Luke jr, back and maxwell are not the original group know as Satoshi or the 'Nakamoto 3'. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 11:47:04
I think there is a positive correlation in meme pool backlog and price, the sooner we shrink blocksize down further creating more block scarcity the better. Someone with with more technical skills might be able to answer this......is it possible to not have any blocks at all and decentralise bitcoins ledger across multiple hubs most Bitcoin companies with any skin in the game could in theory run a "ledger" hub ? This could also fix the Chinese mining problem too and save huge amounts of electrictiy ? 
@_date: 2017-03-12 13:34:44
I guess you are right as long as you don't include the quagmire that is charles lee's lolitecoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:49:54
Guys we're grabbing at straws with this fear mongering about china co-opting Bitcoin via BU it only makes us look like morons. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:06:52
Can't we go back to when it was core with Gavin Andresen? 
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:11:38
Charlie for the win, now let's make litecoin number 2 where it should be. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:18:21
Why can't we just moderate this thread away that way we can save ourselves the trouble of debating whether their should or shouldn't be moderation here. Most Bitcoiners don't have the intellectual ability to think clearly for themselves this is why we have moderation to remove conflicting ideas that just cause anger and confusion. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:18:11
Hold on I thought greg maxwell, adam back and lukejr were the "Nakamoto 3" ? Who the heck is Craig Wright apparently he's not an american, can anyone name a single thing that came out of australia ? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 21:25:06
When BU takes over I'll move to litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 08:19:06
Aha folks used to say this exact thing about Bitcoin," but but Bitcoin what can I actually buy with it" ( the answer was alpaca socks :)
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:56:12
Whats going here are the mods asleep or something !! we need a sanitising team on this thread ASAP. That thing from mission impossible (face mask) I think some government agency set on destroying Bitcoin has replaced roger ver, can anyone get up close and see if there's a silicone seam around his neckline ? Maybe we need proof-of-ver?
