I was working out at a gym in San Diego and I overheard a group of bros talking about bitcoin, this was also the first time I've heard someone talk about bitcoin in a public place.  It took 6 years but people are finally starting to take bitcoin srs.

I think we will see a huge rise in price when it becomes possible to buy bitcoin instantly online, I used a bitcoin ATM for the first time a couple weeks ago and it was so easy and fast I got my bitcoins within seconds,  I hope ATM becomes widespread soon.

It would be awesome if we actually had a choice in where our tax money went. With bitcoin everyone could finally have a say in it. We could use the blockchain to vote for tax projects and see what are tax money is being spent on. Instead of tax money being spent on the military industrial complex we could invest in projects that would benefit society. For example instead of building plain old roads, we could build projects like solar powered panels roads, or build super fast bullet trains that are interconnected to every major city. The possibilities are endless, I know it's sounds farfetched but I think bitcoin has the potential to revolutionize the world.

I just looked up bill gates net worth and Forbes has him at number one with $81 billion. Bill gates could improve the infrastructure of 20 third world country's but instead he just keeps getting richer every fucking year. No one should have that much money.I find it funny how people say bill gates helps out poor nations through his foundation, when in fact he uses those same poor nations to get rare metals and resources to build his products. He doesn't give a fuck about poor people if he did he wouldn't have $81 billion dollars, he would give 90 percent of it away.

I think it's funny that people think the only way bitcoin will have a insane market cap is if we have mainstream consumer adoption, when in reality that will be the very last case that happens. VC money and wallstreet will get rich off bitcoin way before we see the average Joes using bitcoin.

Does anyone know how long it took bitcoin in 2013  to reach a high of $1200? And how many bitcoins were mined at the time?

One way to stop this would be to put a scannable QR code next to the price for the product your wanting to buy, once you scan it,it will automatically take that item out of inventory in the system, so if you walk out of the store with more items than the inventory has taken out the anti theft system at the exit of the store will beep and a associate will check your cart to make sure everything is correct

How does it work with a credit or debit card, do they have all your bank info?

there is usually lines at self checlout, and self checlout is really sluggish and slow and messes up all the time and than you have to wait for the clerk to check your bags. What if the products barcodes knows that its been scaned and payed for through the app, so when you walk out the store the senser can read if its been paid for or not. I know that it does not exist right now but some smart person out there could develop it.

Self checkout has long lines and is slow and sluggish, and sometimes it freezes and the clerk has to check your bags. When you scan a product the store will know it's been payed for so when you walk by the the anti theft sensors when you leave the store it would beep if it wasn't payed for

Bitcoin would be perfect for online gaming like call of duty, and since microsoft is allready accepting bitcoin  it would be easy to add btc to there xbox online account. Each player from each team could send btc to a xbox escrow app, and whichever team wins the match will receive the winnings split up evenly to each of there  xbox wallets.
