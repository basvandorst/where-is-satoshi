I would more disagree on bitcoin being what he forecasted because if he wants E-cash as something to bypass government taxation, then bitcoins is terrible because transaction is publically ledged. bitcoin actually decreases government's job because the blockchain does the book keeping for them.

If monero ever threatens bookkeeping of transactions the government will simply illegalise monero completely. When that happens, how will you get monero without being associated as a user of monero?

The reason that there's limits on how much money you can take out of the country is so you're forced to use banks which is precisely to book keep cash. 
Torrents threatens for the most part IP creators. But crypto threatens federal reserve etc which one do you think will warrant a bigger action?

Poloneix, you guys are mean, stop freezing my accounts over nothing. You freeze, i increase verification, you unfreeze and then you freeze again. I know im ugly but you still want a passport selfie. I bet you're selling it on black market, or you're just going to leak it into black market when you get hacked like mt gox.
Im going to spank your bum if i see you and give you a cleaveland steamer.

What's so shocking? Eating the cost? 
These are withdraw fees we're talking about, it wouldn't be surprising if they allowed even 0 withdraw fees. The burden of lower fees is a cost only on the client.

monero is hard to use. In order to get private transactions, you have to download the entire blockchain and also run a tor node on another device and route everything through there. It's very difficult to set up properly.

But yes, for the people that can do it properly, it would be close to what milton is talking about if you don't believe in russia's reports that all computers have hardware plugs by NSA for the past 10 and a bit years.
