If u can’t love urself how can u love another. U can’t give away something unless u have that to give away. Forgive urself. Love urself first. Then, u can give it away, if u want to. If.

Yes they can.  However, They love their children. Don’t U? And they ❤️ love their children, and they want their kids to be Happy. That’s the caveat. The regulators want/ need their kids to have a better world than they did. Just like u would with ur kids. However it’s a different world now.  And WE as the OLDER people are in a quandary let our kids suffer and or spoil them so they don’t need to like we did. In our own way.  Go Bitcoin!

Credit cards are equal to MARGIN on stock trades.  Why do they let people use credit cards to get cash at a Casino?  Because it’s competition to them(the system).  Wouldn’t you do the same. ? They do not want Bitcoin to succeed. Period. That’s why.

@_date: 2018-02-05 05:39:14
My point was that considering a price that went from around 2k to 20k back to again around 7.8 k today 8k is pretty good (prediction), because they couldn’t take it down further. I call it the thanksgiving rally because all the peeps involved in bitcoin told their friends/families. Now back to why 8k is the bottom because prior to that; that was the price before the friends/families. :)
