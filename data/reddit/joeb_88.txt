What are all the red/blue arrows going to?

Wouldn't you rather keep your coins in your home on a device rather than in someone else's hands?
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:19:27
Yeah but if you've got thousands of dollars on a USB stick, don't be careless about it.  I keep mine in a safe.

You can thank the new documentary on Netflix.

What do you recommend?

Interesting.  So is our money backed by something else or is it all just being printed out of thin air, so to speak?

It was never at 1800 last week.

I made this spreadsheet really quick so it's ugly and labeled all weird but it works:
The left column dynamically pulls the current price data from the Coinbase API, so the middle "Your Wallet" stays up to date.  Modify the prices on the right to test what your wallet could be.  You only need to modify the "Amount" and "Test Worth" columns.

I'd bet we hit 4k within the next hour or two.  Wouldn't be surprised if we see mass sells at 4k - 4.2k though.

Yeah, we're all having issues today. See this thread:

It should show as 'Pending' in your CB account.  I'm guessing they are having issues today -- I withdrew some coins as well and it's been 'Pending' for several hours now.  It's usually instant.

Do you have any knowledge of programming?  If not then this is way over your head.  You can use the CB or GDAX API.

Forgive my ignorance but is the USD not backed by gold?
@_date: 2017-10-01 20:50:50
Yes, it will.  Open up Coinbase and look there.

Haha you're good.  If you need any future help/advice feel free to pm me.
