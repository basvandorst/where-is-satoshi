I could be mistaken because it's been a while, but wasn't Satoshi known for using the double-space after periods? Reading the article, the screen shot from his alleged blog post uses single spaces.

Yea... as would a single $1 transaction, or any transaction. Pretty silly.

youre right about the chart being irrelevant, but for the wrong reasons.
a simple regression model is inane in regards to predicting future performance of any given market price, especially one thats currently based mostly on speculation. this has been proven time and time again in the stock market.
there are future variables that are currently non-existent; therefore its impossible to quantify their effects on the market price down the road.
even if all future variables could be accounted for and quantified, this graph would still be considered nonsense.

just graphic design... in the physical store front we sell everything from stickers to paint but we mostly do clothing

my problem with this is that the malware will evolve (if it hasnt already) its algorithms to detect and recognize these minute honeypots and learn to continue the attack elsewhere, without ever triggering the alarm. but i like the idea.

theres been an increase in posts of this nature lately, and i really dont like the tone. yes, bitcoin is libertarian and anarchic in nature, but we dont need to be so outspoken and emotional about it - it makes the community look bad and will only challenge and subsequently encourage authoritarian governments to do all they can to interfere with the currency.  just let bitcoin do bitcoin.

So you're saying Coinbase would still have my private keys if I used their cold storage vault option? They say that they only store the keys in the hot wallet, and that the cold storage option should be used with caution because they can't help in the event you lose your private keys.

SealsWithClubs. There was some pretty sketchy things going on. I used to play a lot of online poker and hadn't seen anything like it. Let's just say I won't be playing there again 
@_date: 2015-05-08 11:40:39
They have new ownership "SWCPoker", and a new PC client which is a lot better than the old software

Lost 2 bitcoins playing online poker.

And this guy is lucky. Almost 95% of people don't see anything in return. As someone involved in the gambling community, Civil Asset Forfeiture is a huge issue and a lot of my friends have been victims of the government's misuse of power. You are basically guilty until proven innocent, and the best case scenario is that you get most of your money back at the expense of counsel. Luckily, recently there's been bills proposed in congress to limit the government's authority in these situations, but it's gonna be an issue for quite some time going forward. I think I remember reading that Civil Asset Forfeiture accounts for 20% of all police department revenue. Straight up robbin' fools

Sorry, I forgot that I had named my vault "Cold Storage". What I was actually referring to was the multisig vault. Thanks for the information on the multisig vault, was just what I was looking for.

Yea, the ATM was working while I was there. He said he sees people buying bitcoin at the ATM fairly often, but never spending it. Of course, like all BTC ATMs, you can only buy not sell BTC, and there's a huge fee involved and from what I hear, a pretty big hassle. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 22:28:38
Cool, I downloaded it earlier, I'll start using it tomorrow and let you know what I think. Thanks

Yeah, I know most people are using it as a value store right now, but the reason I got into BTC - and the same reason most early adopters did - is because I thought it was a great alternative to the current fiat banking system. But these fees aren't making it pragmatic. If BTC really wants to go to the moon, it needs to find a solution to the increasingly high transaction fees on the blockchain.  I've made a point of spending BTC in places, especially when traveling, that accept BTC as a payment method, in an attempt to contribute to the spreading/adoption of bitcoin. But it's just not economical to be paying a $2 transaction fee for an $8 sandwich. I'm surprised I haven't heard more about this from the community lately
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:36:04
I don't have the skill set or resources to contribute to this. I got into bitcoin in 2011 to play online poker, and I really liked the idea behind it, and have been following/investing in/spending bitcoin ever since, but I don't completely understand all of the technology. I can code, but that's above my paygrade. I was just alarmed when I moved some BTC around last night and noticed the high transaction fees
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:06:05
Not trolling, just haven't been following the past year or so. Heard about BCC so I got on my wallets to redeem them. Been holding my coins offline (so I have sole ownership of private keys) so I had no problem getting my BCC. So that's why BCC was created, as a solution to high BTC transaction fees? Makes sense
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:01:10
I couldn't care less about the transaction fees personally, I just want to see bitcoin succeed in the long run and become a standard payment method, but with the current transaction fees, this won't be happening 
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:45:03
Well, where's the solution? We're already paying $2-$3 in fees every transaction. It should've already been resolved by now
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:48:53
Ah - haven't been following it too closely lately. The transaction fees used to be a couple of pennies, I was shocked when I noticed $14 had been eaten up from my wallets just from a few transactions tonight moving some BTC around. So basically, there's not much of a solution, and this is going to be a big problem for bitcoin going forward. If people really want full adoption of bitcoin for what it was really made for, something will have to be done about these fees. Bitcoin kinda loses its intrinsic value if it's not economical to be able to pay for things with BTC
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:37:27
So in theory, the BCC transaction fees would be, on average, 1/8th the cost of BTC transaction fees at the same price points?
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:02:27
But then if BCC price went up, we'd have the same problems? Or is that why BCC was created, for lower transaction fees? Sorry, haven't been following lately

I'm an American currently living in Australia. I tried getting a $200 wire transfer from back home and the banks wanted to charge me $55. Not only that, but if you do decide to do the transfer, it will take up to 5 business days and they screw you out of another 2-3% on the exchange rate. The form required to send the wire transfer is pretty complicated and all of the details have to be perfect for the transfer to go through. In this situation, I honestly think it would be an easier process to just send bitcoins, even with the current "user unfriendly" nature of setting up wallets etc. There have been a number of times the past few weeks where I've thought "wouldn't it be so much easier, better and efficient if everyone just used god damn bitcoin"

I understand that nobody can predict the future. I'm only looking for a response from somebody who's educated on the matter. I know that's tough to find, but I figured this forum would be my best bet.

Capiche. The goal is determining what stage of the bubble!
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:52:01
I would also assume that if there's a correction that it would only drop to around $200 at the least... But fuck, what a volatile commodity/currency! Aside from an abbreviated background in statistics and probability, I'm pretty clueless in this field, but I would assume the recent adoption of BTC by major, legitimate companies would indicate a more stabilized price of the currency in the future. 
Can anybody fill me in on why it spiked/bubbled in April?
