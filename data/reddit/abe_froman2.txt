What is the least screwed up/risky exchange? I've been on Polo just because they are US based which gives me some amount of irrational comfort. After seeing how many people get hacked or phished and lose their money I am very concerned. No recourse if that happens. I don't know how people leave large sums on the exchanges without getting an anxiety disorder.

This worked for me.

The hodlers were hodling away in their chairs, while visions of fiat danced in their heads.

There is a major phishing scam going on with Bittrex right now. My account got compromised but thankfully I didn't have any coins in there. As of a couple days ago if you Googled Bittrex the first result was a phishing site that steals your login info. This kind of stuff is what makes me hesitant to expand my position. So easy to lose a lot of money...

Yep, LOL.

I just wish I would've bought BTC and held instead of messing with alts. That would've made me the most money and saved a lot of time. Everything is still very much tied to BTC for now.

I spent the last 3 months trying to day trade $150. I got as low as $124 and as high as $250 and now I am back to around $173 after this latest BTC push. I can't imagine the stress adding a couple zeros onto that $150 would cause me. This isn't a game for casuals.

Considering it is built on the same tech as XRP, sure, but I don't know enough about their organization as I do Ripple. I first bought XRP way back in 2013 and the value increase earlier this year is what got me into messing with the day trades. I still keep a long position in XRP off the exchanges.

XRP, SC, DGB, STR, LTC at various times. I'm just learning this game so I made the mistake of emotional trading and got caught in traps. XRP is the most resistant to BTC price influence and has a good real world use case.

Trading rules apply to crypto currency?

Especially the last few months a lot of people have lost a lot of money "investing" in crypto. Do your homework before you invest in something with little to no real world value. I invest in use cases not coins.

It is almost comical to watch these news articles pump out as the price rises and falls. One thing though, there was a repeating bullish article pattern last year that said Bitcoin would hit 10k in 2017 and it did. News and FOMO influences prices more than anything so as long as we keep seeing articles saying 50k we could likely see it imo.
