Basically the ol’ (reddit) trick. Aka bots swarming and vote manipulation. Also the big banker types that fund and prop up mods on this site hate decentralization and love $$$.

I come back after months of my hodl to see what’s up and man does this sub feel different. A lot of confusion and misunderstanding mixed with the rush of insane profiting and fear of losing it. We shall see in time how things play out ultimately.

I love watching reddit become more divisive and cancerous. Hopefully it comes all the way around and cryptocurrency will be banned by governments around the world because of this subreddit.

Not a protest, derpy Riot by Antifa/Soros. Backed by the mayor of the city WITH stand down order for the cops. Just read the tweets by the mayor calling Milo a White Supremacist. Free speech right out the window. Oh yeah Milo was coming to beat up all his audience with his gold chain. *Facepalm*

Just know that coinbase has a good chance of crashing during hard dips. Did not have any problems last $2300 dip though.
@_date: 2017-06-13 05:20:00
