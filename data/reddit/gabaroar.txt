From how I read it.  Max was going to receive btc for his ltc and the scammer was to send his btc first.  After 3 confirms Max would send the ltc.  The scammer wanted to trade a blockchain account with the btc in it for the ltc.  The problem was the blockchain account did not own the addresses.  They were watched addresses.

I don't feel the risk of loosing 3 to 5 dollars on whether or not someone is running a scam on novelty items is worth my time worrying.  These things are conversation starters not cold storage.

This happened to me to.  I spoke to a customer service rep and they said it was for my records.  This was my first time dealing with tigerdirect so it caught me off-guard.

The video is of a man Stefan Molyneux explains his view that the protests were a military coup orchestrated by the us government.  Honestly I only watched a minute of it.  I stopped when he said the protest was organized by the US government to install missiles on the Russian border.  Below is the about text from the video were he lists his sources.
What is going on in the Ukraine? Just another hapless herd of tax cattle being paid, poked and punished by the USA and USSR in yet another round of superpower hell-chess brinksmanship.
Correction From Previous Video: Viktor Andriyovych Yushchenko is the former President of Ukraine. He took office on January 23, 2005, following the Orange Revolution. Viktor Fedorovych Yanukovych has been President of Ukraine since February 2010.

The International Monetary Fund issued on Thursday a scathing report on Ukraine's financial situation, saying that the government of President Viktor F. Yanukovich had largely abandoned much-needed economic reforms that it had agreed to undertake as part of a deal in 2010 that provided more than $15 billion in loans.
The protests were set off by the announcement on Thursday that the Ukrainian government would no longer pursue preparations for the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union in order to "ensure the national security of Ukraine" and "restore lost trade volumes with the Russian Federation."
The deal would have created a new framework for trade between the former Soviet republic and the EU, but was seen as worrisome by Russia, which had threatened economic sanctions and travel restrictions should the deal go through. The Ukrainian parliament had also voted down bills last week which would have allowed imprisoned former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko -- a key figure in the Orange Revolution -- to go to Germany for medical treatment.
On the 13th of March, 2012 the European Union prepared to finalize an association agreement. Despite president Yanukovych's assurance that Ukrainian law would soon align with that required by the EU, all progress effectively stopped after reports of industrial production had fallen by 5.4%.
On the 21st of November, 2013 a government decree officially ceased all association talks with the EU as the government began taking steps towards a pro-Russian trade alliance.
On January 16th, 2014 as what is now known in the Ukraine as "Black Thursday", the government passed laws prohibiting any and all forms of public protest, assembly, and restricting heavily the Ukrainian's freedom of speech. These laws have taken on the name "The Dictatorship Laws".
US Assistant Secretary of State for Europe, Victoria Nuland said: "Since the declaration of Ukrainian independence in 1991, the United States supported the Ukrainians in the development of democratic institutions and skills in promoting civil society and a good form of government - all that is necessary to achieve the objectives of Ukraine's European. We have invested more than 5 billion dollars to help Ukraine to achieve these and other goals. " Nuland said the United States will continue to "promote Ukraine to the future it deserves."

I always like things like this and would be happy to donate to a sponsorship deal.  However, there are some variables here.  A major one being your friends permission.  You should have probably asked him first.  Some other things such the cost of the sponsorship and someone trustworthy to hold the coins are big ones.

As rcsquake mentioned below I did not take into account that your computer may not have a internet connection, silly of me.  You can download the installer for the package from the ubuntu packages site [twisted-python package]( and install it from your thumb drive.  Rcx also mentioned they have a offline version of your software just for this probelm.

Preface I have never used Electrum.  But in the new ubuntu ui that was released several versions ago the file menu is at the top of the screen instead of on the window.  Maybe the settings screen is hidden there.

No problem.  You have three options to install software in ubuntu. Two of them are from the terminal, which is the command prompt for  ubuntu, and from the software center.  If you click the application button at the top left of your screen you will have the option to search for an application, type in "terminal".  Once terminal has opened type in "sudo apt-get install python-twisted" its going to ask for your password and if you would like to install the python-twisted library type "y" and press enter.  The process is practically the same for the application center but provides a graphical interface to install the software.

I'm confused about this. Is it another notation for writing bitcoin prices?  Why not use millibits?

I don't know the actual methods they use and I am not sure they are posted anywhere.  This is just what i have read during a quick google search of your question.  I think you will get a more concise answer in the askreddit sub-reddit.

I suggest reading as much as you can about the subject.

To my knowledge link karma is not a simple upvotes - downvotes. There is a algorithm with a some decay worked in so posts eventually fall of the front page. Also the true value of the link is not displayed to throw of bots.

Nope, Linux is generally considered to be more secure than windows but not required.

Living in a small town in Arkansas I often get asked why I like this bitcoin stuff so much.  And, the answer is how easy it is to spend online while not giving up valueable information about myself.  Being a techy in the middle of Arkansas most of things I am interested in have to be purchased online and I have had my debit card compromised in the past as a result.  Now when I purchase something online none of my credit card information is given to the company I am purchasing from so there is no risk of credit card fraud.  The only information I give is my shipping address.
Its cash for the connected world.

I looks like you just dont have the twisted python package installed on your ubuntu machine.  Try "sudo apt-get install python-twisted" from the terminal and see if that does not fix your problem.  [twisted-python package](

I enjoyed watching the video on stabmag. Crowd funding would be a good alternative.  I would be cautious of any crowd sourcing that has nudity on the main page as the link may be difficult to pass around.

I have purchased cards similar to these from a website to pass off to family and friends.  Never had more than a couple of dollars worth on them.

There is a thread on [bitcointalk](  about the corrupted db.  If you have not used the wallet yet you can reinstall.  There is also a torrent of the blockchain that will speed up the install by providing the blockchain up to a certain date so the client does not have to download everything.
I just read your question about the blockchain growth of the bitcoin wallet.  Looking at this [chart]( its grown 10 gigs in a year.  Storage wise this is not that bad.  For comparison most video games now are about the size of the blockchain or bigger.
