if you run a full bitcoin wallet, then you run a node. if you run cgminer and point it to your bitcoin wallet  then you are solo mining.( if you run cgminer and point it to ghash.io then you are pool mining. but you dont need to run full bitcoin wallet todo pool mining)
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:44:19
I wonder what will you do to increase bitcoin full node ? would you consider making bitcoin POS and POW ? maybe 50-50 in the future?

if bitcoin ever hit 40,000 usd within 30 days i will send you 1 btc, otherwise you send me 40,000 usd. fair enough isnt ? agree ?

*"More seriously, what does it mean for a currency to be finitely limited?"*
*"How many US dollars exist? Its a tricky question to ask. How many printed dollars exist? In Circulation $1.36* *Trillion worth of printed notes exist. How many dollars exist in bank accounts? $11.8 Trillion. And how much* *money exists as obscure contracts we call "derivatives?" Approximately $600 Trillion."*
beg the question, would it be matter if you can sell "derivative" of finite currency ? or is it better than printing invinite currency for eternity and sell more of it as "derivative" ???

its possible to mix pos and pow like PPC coin or even making masternode like DASH which will solve problem of fundraising for the btc development too.
 
@_date: 2015-04-15 05:48:26
you can always use dash

use offline linux to generate bitcoin address using 
then print the result and save the file for backup, install multibit and import key using the importprivkey command.  To do this, select Help -&gt; Debug Window, and in the window, on the bottom line, enter importprivkey &lt;privatekey&gt;
for extra safety encrypt the wallet and write the password on the paper that you print the backup. 
store this paper (and flasdisk that contain the backup key) in your most secure location or rent a bank vault.

without bitcoin, it will be torrent and without the miner there will be a hacker paradise.
@_date: 2015-03-03 15:53:21

or maybe you can just make your own paper address ( and import them to your mycelium/multibit if necessary ?
honestly i will help you keep the bitcoin, inform me if you interested. thanks

hmmm... yes teaching an noob always that difficult. when i learn bitcoin at the 1st time, i dont get it at all. i download the wallet, get the blockchain and i still dont get it, where do i have to register my bitcoin address ?  
then i try litecoin and mining with it and realizing how it work when i receive my first cryptocurrency of 0.1 ltc. 
so the best bet is give them wallet and give them 0.005 btc to help them learn
