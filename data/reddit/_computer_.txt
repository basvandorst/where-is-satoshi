I love bitcoin but I am so sick of r/bitcoins bullSHIT.
A SV VC thinks it'll be worth 100K... woopty fucking doo!!! WE'RE ALL GONNA BE RICH!! 
People need to quit being so god damn concerned with the price of Bitcoin... It's just a reflection of what bitcoin has really become, a center of greed and get-rich-quick guys. Quit posting this price speculation stuff and just start using it and selling things in it.

I'm not expecting any change. This fight will never change. There will always be a fight between oppression and freedom. It's a matter of identity. Who are you? What are you about?
Chickens and wolves would both be better off left in the wild than to let the wolves guard the hen-house. Other animals don't like being in cages because they know instinctively that it is not where they are supposed to be. So they attack and defend themselves. Humans are the same and eventually natural order will be established.

assthete, Smart rich folks are not holding their assets in cash/dollars....They are holding assets. Real things of value (land, gold, cattle, real estate, food, water, planes).... 
smart people don't keep millions in a bank unless they are lending that money out, but if we're talking about the same people here they are getting it at 0% interest and selling it at &gt;0% interest and have no risk.......

You cannot change a corrupt system that has built in mechanisms to stifle dissent from within, especially not by obeying the orders it dictates to you.. Let's extrapolate this to Nazi Germany. Do you really think that people had a chance of stopping wrong-doing by participating in the Nazi government? Lolsworthy
When the orders from government stray from what is right and fair and you still execute them, you are an enabler and a coward. Plain and simple.
To think that you will actually affect meaningful change within this system is literally laughable. ('This system' being US govt)... It's not noble. It's not strategic. It's just cowardly and it plays into the hands of your oppressors.
The reason why the Americans had an actual war and left Britain to form a new, and improved system is because they understood that it did them no good to cooperate with the "way the world work"ed. They were forced to create a "New World".
There has always been a constant fight between oppression and liberty. Between subversion and accountability. You choose to passively support oppression rather than fight it.
"You can't change much behind bars." Poppycock. Do you know what it signifies to other people when innocent people are thrown in jail/prison/camps? Tyranny. People don't like tyranny. You can jail a man but you can't jail his spirit. You can't jail an idea. JFK, Henry David Thoreau, Martin Luther King Jr, Gandhi, Jesus etc all paid prices for their beliefs and they are markers of history and champions of freedom because they actually stood up and said something. Now of course it's not easy and it's not a walk in the park, but who cares about a walk in the park when it entails being asked for your papers by an overbearing ignorant mafia-thug in a costume with the threat of a gun/tazer.

First of all, I fucked up saying people are stupid and brainwashed for not understanding how and why fiat currencies will fail, that's not necessarily true, but they are ignorant. 
Secondly, you are straight up *WRONG* about the protocol not being designed to reduce volatility via the free market by choking supply. The designer(s) of this protocol did not simply overlook the fact that as a currency bitcoins would need to stabilize so that they may have an actual use as a currency. They knew what deflationary spirals were (as do I)... In order to prevent runaway deflationary spirals the supply of the coins are choked at a predictable rate. Bitcoins price/time has followed y=x^(1/2). There is a near 95% confidence that the price in 10 years will be somewhere between 900 and 3000 USD... I'm not saying that this is surely going to continue, or that the protocol is designed to have the same manners of price **control** that a fiat currency has; but the supply of bitcoins is DESIGNED to be choked in a predictable manner without a central arbiter so that predictable demand will allow prices to stabilize by what the free market decides; rather than a bank controlling interest rates. It's modeled very closely after the properties of gold..... I'd start by reading the bitcoin wiki. 
You see, you're taking your very very very very short amount of time on planet Earth and looking at how fiat moneys have done just fine for this time you've been alive, and you are calling me naiive for thinking the dollar will fail... Why?? Show me a fiat currency/money that has stood the test of time... Spoiler Alert: There are none. 
Now let's check out deflationary currencies/money that have stood the test of time::::Gold &amp; Silver:::: 
Fiat currencies/moneys don't work when you have private central banks creating the notes for a country's money supply...  All the fiat currencies dictated by private centralized banks have failed. Call it prophecy, but the dollar will go down in history as the largest ponzi scheme ever pulled off.. You can call me naiive all you want. Your personalized insults are just as much bullshit as me calling people stupid.
"I'm stupid and brainwashed. I'm assuming you are a phd level economist and work in the industry? Or are you just another bitcoiner who educates himself off of forum comments? Because that's what it sounds like."
To answer your question, yes I am a Bitcoiner who educates himself of freely available information on the internet including forum posts and wikis. No I am not an economist who works in *the industry* (by industry do you mean the fuckin economy? or as a business analyst or what????)......
You show a trend of judging a book by it's cover... I'd start by reading... 
Then I'd go on to check out ...
Then I would go look at this dude 
The guy literally learned all of his information about finance from chatting on forum posts and watching financial markets. Didn't have a degree in economics. Just had a thinking brain. Made gobs and gobs and gobs of cash while thousands of PHD holding economists and IB professionals held their collective dicks in their hands.
There's quite a few PHD's that would say the dollar/fiat will fail, and there's quite a few PHD's that would say the dollar/fiat won't fail. There's different definitions of failure and success. My definition of failure is one that incorporates theft of value as a fucking business model for private banks. 
Overall: 
Bitcoin will stabilize in relation to goods and services and gold.

"Those things have real world intrinsic value and utility. They are consumable products, not currencies as well."
Bitcoin technology has intrinsic value. Can you send .01 cent to 100 BILLION dollars without a significant fee any other way?
"Gone up a lot, based entirely on speculation. It's utility has not increased to reflect it's growth in value. IE; It's overvalued currently on speculation it will be worth more in the future. Totally different than food or oil."
Fair enough to say it's entirely speculative, but you act as if that's a bad thing. Its utility does not need to grow to justify the growth if it is something that is extremely undervalued. 
"I should drink the bitcoin kool-aid and ignore reality and believe in something entirely on faith that it's going to be better eventually!"
No. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Many asswhipes, dickheads, and jackoffs will tell you BTC is going to be this and that; and these people *are* mentally retarded, BUT, you sound like one of these people just regurgitating shit you've heard without actually doing any research. Bitcoin could quite simply be the answer to a myriad of financial/monetary problems. If there were only 21 Million dollars for the entire world to share, how many gallons of gasoline would a single dollar buy you?

Valid Concerns in my opinion. I'm glad finally someone has stepped up to the plate and risked the downvoting. Upvote for you. 
However, you are forgetting that you are an EARLY adopter. This IS early adoption. The fact there are so many holes is not some form of death sentence or cause for concern. The free market WILL create solutions around these issues. Bitcoin's role in society may have no place in retail transactions and may one day just be a store of value (when/if the price stabilizes). On the other hand, it could be worth nothing tomorrow... 
Chin up!

I like how you ask me to propose a viable alternative to forcible/jailable taxation in a **modern** first-world-society, and then cite that philanthropy can not be done because it didn't work in the **Victorian** era....
Just to humor you: Taxation via Voluntarism, Crowdfunding, Privatization of goods and services are perfectly good alternatives to forcible jailable taxation . 
You say " so there would be no guarantee of roads anywhere? Or pavements? Water networks? Education? Healthcare? Bin collection? Sounds like paradise to me."
 There's no guarantee of any of that WITH taxes... The education, water, and healthcare systems are piss poor while being extremely expensive.

Well, the dollar is a short-fall away from it's death. The dollar will not survive. If you do not understand this as a clearly foreseeable event you are brainwashed or stupid. We cannot keep printing debt and expect to pay off the debt+interest with debt notes...it's absolutely absurd. Things to have livestock, fruit, vegetables, a means of energy production, guns, land, precious metals and if you believe that the internet will still be here in 10 years, Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not even close to stable as a 'currency' or 'store of value', but the protocol is designed in a way that if people continue to use it and adoption hits critical mass then the value will stabilize.

How exactly do you know anything about what Bobby Lees intentions are?
@_date: 2014-05-05 20:24:00
sorry to burst your bubble, but a business venture is not illegitimate because it is illegal. It's illegal to grow your own garden food and sell it without paying the state a licensing fee. It's illegal to buy marijuana and sell to someone else. Is that illegitimate? No. It's entirely legitimate if you own your own body and the transaction is one that is voluntary... Don't know about you, but I own my own body. Not the state. If I'm not harming anybody or using force against someone exactly where does it become illegitimate?
 How this notion implies some sense of immaturity is beyond me. It's basic libertarian ideals and it is what STARTED Bitcoin. You are correct, the majority of this community is focused on being 'an early adopter' and making a killing in fiat rather than standing up for the virtues in which Bitcoin was created. Good on you for understanding the situation as it is.
"You don't need the community as a whole promoting illegal ventures during this precarious time when *we* are seeking mass acceptance amongst merchants and people in general."
There you go with that **"we"** thing again. You can strike me from your 'we'. From now on just type "we - _computer_"... I'm not one of those that views Bitcoin's success as being contingent upon mass adoption from merchants. It's success is already secured in that it aids many in purchasing items, drugs, etc tax free and enables people to hide their money from viruses who exist solely from theft and intimidation all while ending the monopoly over money/currency in a voluntary fashion. 
"Most people want to distance themselves from shit like that."
[Yeah the majority usually tends to be right.](

"The intrinsic value of one BTC should not be $950 at the moment"
... How'd you come to this conclusion? It's worth what someone will pay for it. Period. To say that Bitcoin has intrinsic value is a bit off in my opinion. Food/Energy has intrinsic value, not much else...
"but a NVC for $21 or a NMC at $6.50?" ....
see above. Namecoin genuinely provides a very, very cool idea which will lead to a more free internet by spawning the decentralization of DNS creation. Should it be used as a currency? I don't know. 
I have been hardcore exclusively Bitcoin-favored for a while now, but I am beginning to take a look at the altcoins seriously, not just for investment reasons, but for ethical reasons. Primecoin probably won't help science too much regardless of the primes it finds. I don't really understand Peercoin or NovaCoin, but Namecoin seems very smart. Litecoin is still pretty useless IMO. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:46:15
I also question this. To me it seems that spending and paying for things is a necessary obligation to have it work as a currency, but I think there is too much focus on this matter. Currently, *most* people purchase coins through exchanges. However, when Bitcoins are dispersed thoroughly and decentralized exchanges become sufficient then exchanges will not be able to get such a good fee. Maybe an entirely new platform we haven't thought of will catapult alongside the Bitcoin protocol. When the markets of Western Union, virtually all banks, and Paypal begin to pour into cryptocoins the value will explode and the community will solidify once again. People should understand this is valuable whether it's a commodity, currency, stock, trap. History is being made. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:51:59

Whitelisting public addresses would effectively regulate commerce in the US until this process is circumvented, but the community will most likely beat them to the punch. Worse comes to worse, bitcoin fails and we adapt. Only a matter of time until these banks become so obsolete and irrelevant that people make the switch to something. In this case banks will probably try to reestablish metal standards.
