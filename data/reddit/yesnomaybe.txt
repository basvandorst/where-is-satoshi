All *new* employees. If they accepted bitcoins recently, then current employees should already know how. That was the point of my question: why stop when you already do it? 
FWIW, I'm not arguing that they should or shouldn't accept bitcoin...I genuinely want to know the answer.

As a contractor (and contract manager) who often has to explain to clients why something they think a developer should bill 5 hours for actually takes closer to 15 hours, people *never* take other parts of the development process (testing, debugging, code reviews, task management/tracking, etc.) into account. All they think of is the best case scenario of one guy doing actual programming for 5 hours and it just works.

I have a semi-related story. 
I had just gotten a new Visa card with the numbers printed horizontally. The entire card was basically flipped 90 degrees and the numbers were across the small side. I had traveled to DC and was doing interviews all over the place so I just took the metro &amp; cabs away from metro-available areas. 
Heading to my hotel for the night, the cab driver wouldn't take my card. He actually had one of those imprinters and it *couldn't* imprint my card in the right location. He had to drive me around (off the meter of course) looking for an ATM before he would drop me off at the hotel.
It really sucked at the time because I had been traveling and interviewing all day and was fucking exhausted. It's a little anecdote for me to tell at parties and random reddit threads now though, so there's that.

They aren't comparable. The demand for weed doesn't really change so any government crackdown makes the supply go down, price goes up. If more governments crackdown on bitcoin use, the demand for bitcoin will most certainly drop while the supply is the same, making the price go down.

Call a law office and see how much an hour or two of their time would cost you to have them send a C&amp;D letter to someone. I mean, the paper is free and most already have a standard C&amp;D form letter to use. 
You aren't paying for the paper and them actually sending it; You're paying for their knowledge of the law. Similarly, they aren't paying for a free account, a small change to their web site, and a random guy off the street to come talk to them for a few minutes; They are paying for his specific experience and knowledge of how Bitcoin works.

It sounds like you are describing it as a product used to generate profit. That's a very distorted view of its use. If no new money came into the system, the function of bitcoin as a currency (which, after all, is the intent) would be completely unhindered.

There is no real free market in health care. If you get cancer and the market decides what you pay, you pay _everything_, everything you have...or die. That's the free market. Regulation in health-care exists, in most cases, because it made sense.
Yes, all the power being given to insurance companies is a terrible thing. They decide what doctors you can see, what services you can render, what they will/won't pay for and you have very little say in the matter. The ACA attempted to make it a little more of a free insurance market from the consumer viewpoint but we saw how that went. Insurance is a _bad_ way to handle health care.
If we are serious about having everyone having access to health care (like pretty much all other first world countries) then there is really only one serious way to approach the issue. "Free market" and "too much regulation" folks can pretend this isn't true, but it's just a fact. It's either that or we just accept that we don't think everyone should have access to it...which is certainly a valid position to take but if you take it you can't pretend that free market is a real solution to quality of health care for the most people.

That's right. AFAIK, that part would be off blockchain and admittedly the weak link in my idea, but the domain-specific value tokenization and its handling would be on the blockchain. And unlike with a value-only store/exchange, it wouldn't be some percentage of Ethereum, it would be its own token supported by the ethereum network.
You could just say "we accept bitcoin" and that's that but you miss out on any functional regulation of your token, like being able to increase supply of your token with added available product or suppliers. You could have token "states" (like "waiting delivery", "waiting approval", "processing", etc.) on token exchange enforced on the blockchain that, while relying on some external application, would allow a distributed and maintained account of the exchange token's ledger. You could have variables on the tokens that change some additional fees, add bonus tokens for various actions, etc. Otherwise, it's just a list of some value moving from one id to another and that's all you know.
I'm just spitballing but I hope you get the idea. There are so many different ways you could manage your own token that are more than just "move this value from this id to this id".
Hell, maybe that's not useful and you _could_ do it on a databases somewhere and do all transactions in some other currency...but I can't help but think that this provides some utility that a traditional payment processing app doesn't do.
FWIW, I'm not completely sold on Ethereum as it stands. I've got some hangups with it for various reasons (and am not sold on the network's ability to solve serious performance problems) but I still think there is a lot of potential in the approach.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:56:57


You could say the same thing about bitcoin. Other parties already manage exchanging value; Bitcoin does it on a blockchain, which to many people has some value. Ethereum is no different. The contract functionality is on the blockchain; that's valuable to many people. Either having transactions on the blockchain is valuable or it isn't.
You can't really claim that one isn't important because other parties/technologies do it and not apply the same argument to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:50:42
Firstly, I'm a developer talking the utility of Ethereum &amp; Bitcoin, not an investor talking about investment opportunities. I don't know shit about markets and prices.
Creating a decentralized, domain specific token with specific functional restrictions/requirements implemented _on_ the blockchain is the single biggest use case for ethereum right now (not saying it's the only case).
That's why it's gotten so popular in the token world. A company or other group can use a custom contract to represent something of value only to them and have it be manipulated through their rules. If you buy into their token, you work in their world. It isn't the same as just storing and/or exchanging value (btc).
That's where all of these ethereum token startups came from. They each saw a market that they thought could benefit from contracts and went at it. You name any market right now and there is probably someone either already implementing a smart-contract token for it. For example, I was so excited because I thought I had a great idea about using it for allowing purchase of legal medical marijuana and processing transactions while enforcing legal requirements (as much as possible)...nope. Someone is already way ahead of me.
Bitcoin is not made for this case...and that's ok. It's not a competition. They both have their utility.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:46:33


Indeed it is, but I am not one of them. It's also frustrating to have people who have insanely strong, emotional opinions on cryptocurrencies without being able to have a reasonable, critical analysis. Either you like it and find every reason to support it or don't like it and find every reason to trash it.
Your criticisms to Ethereum as a usable technology are still just *criticisms of the technology (some of which I wholeheartedly agree), not its utility*...which as stated up-front, is not what I'm talking about. Whether or not you or I agree with the viability or approach, none of our criticisms negate the fact that executing applications on a blockchain is seen as an important aspect for many people.
You say you don't see the utility, that there isn't a demand, but then to argue the point you just talk about the technical issues...which is exactly what I said I wasn't talking about. So you don't see any demand/utility in that, as you said...ok. I don't see how you can't see the utility in that, but whatever...
I'm just wasting my keystrokes anyway because *I'm guessing you wouldn't understand*. See how patronising, condescending talk really ruins an otherwise polite discussion? At no point did I attempt to talk down to you or demean you in any way but you can't help but take the "Everybody that doesn't agree with me is stupid and uninformed" stance. Have fun with that.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:32:26


Are you saying that you don't think that Ethereum having smart contracts on the blockchain isn't a valuable utility? Because not only do I think it _is_ a legitimate utility, I think it's a really important one.
If you want to argue whether or not its limitations and drawbacks make the utility worth it, that's a different argument but I really don't see how you could claim it doesn't have a legitimate use case.

What are you going on about? I agree with the others. You are making this *far* more complicated than it has to be. Use bitcoin, microbc, or millibc as the situation is needed and that's it. 1BTC = 100mBTC = 1000000uBTC. How is that not practical?

@_date: 2013-11-18 21:41:11


The demand is growing at an absolutely incredible rate right now is still primarily made up of early adopters. The percentage of people that even know about bitcoin right now is still minuscule and many that do are still on the fence about what it can do for them.
As adoption rates go up, more *average* users will feel more comfortable jumping in to use bitcoins as an exchange intermediate. If use continues and shows itself as a viable alternative, it will bite into established transaction companies like paypal, western union, etc. It's still early but there is a real opportunity for bitcoin to absolutely demolish those existing money transfer services.
I honestly feel like bitcoin is one of those technology that has, on its surface, a number of uses that are, at a minimum, enough to operate as a successful alternate currency for simple exchanges but is so technologically different from any current financial system that I'm not even sure that the best uses for it have been determined. It just has so much potential.

Correction noted. Was typing faster than my brain but my point still stands. Why not use the correct one where appropriate? I don't understand why you need to formalize a "correct" one to use.

I don't think there is a need to push anything. Just let it grow organically. Right now it makes sense to use mBTC now since it's something most people can relate to. "What's it worth?" "Oh, right now an mBTC is worth about a dollar". If it makes sense in the future, use uBTC.
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:33:08
So, you're saying make everything more complicated simply for the sake of psychology?


Why? It doesn't to me. 6mBTC = 6000uBTC = $50. Why make it more complex than it needs to be to "trick" people into thinking they are getting a better deal? It's just money.
EDIT: correction noted but I still don't see how it makes sense to have a single scale for all purposes. Use the one where it makes sense. It just doesn't make sense to sale a house using the same scale as a pack of gum.

No, he says he believes it has a 20% chance to **change the world**, not a 20% chance of success. 
Success could be defined as anything from "still exists and is in use 10 years from now" to "80% of the world's population uses it to some extent". The chance of a mild success is probably far, far higher than 20%.l

No. 1000 mBTC = 1 BTC. The value of a single bitcoin has adjusted so that 1 BTC = $1000, which means 1 mBTC = $1. 
Yesterday it was just slightly less. $1000 is just kind of a nice round number as a milestone. Tomorrow if it is $1020 or something, that would make 1mBTC $1.02.

Yes, there is always the option that it becomes nothing more than a place to hold money from the government or for more technically inclined people to use as currency. You didn't ask for reasons it *wouldn't* go up though.
There is always a risk that things won't go the way people see them going. The reasons the value will keep increasing is because of the potential to completely revolutionize international banking. Will it? I don't know but the potential is there &amp; that's the reason the value *could* keep increasing.

Kind of but not really. WU was the result of the merging of two companies who both had a large swatch of the geographical telegraph market. By merging, they became the single largest and began buying up other telegraph companies.
By the time they started allowing exchanging of money they already had a giant network of telegraph stations, pretty much giving them that entire market. 
It was a good mix of strategy and luck. If any company had decided to build that from the ground up, it would have been virtually impossible. Even as it was, the building of WU, as the giant that it became, happened over many years.
