Ford doesn't own my car, I do.  But if ford come's out and says I should replace my airbag because it may kill me then I'm going to listen to them and do so.  Likewise, if developers of the lightning network inform me they do not yet recommend using the lightning network, then I will listen to them too.

IIRC, they are separate transactions.  You get taxed on the gain of the first BTC once it is realized (by purchasing at overstock).  The new bitcoin that you purchased is irrelevant until you sell it.
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:27:07
I think this is bs.  why not use a different model?  They could charge like a dollar per video and people would pay that over and over again or prevent you from watching more than 1 minute of the video unless you pay. 
With bitcoin, payments are easy so they can just lure you to spend your money in smaller increments but more frequently

Real backdoors are more likely to be carefully designed bugs that  end users and other developers would never notice but can be exploited if needed.

From what I have read, it appears that this attack is only accessible at the moment from inside the local network too.

Hi CB-Dave,
Can you confirm whether your report still includes canceled orders?  It was always a pain for me to have to strip those out of your report.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:30:01
dude $200 is not cheap.  Many companies can move $100,000.00+ in the traditonal banking system without even paying a fee.  I think my bank charges like $15.00.  The good news is that nobody needs to pay $200.00.  Also, you didn't even answer his question...lame.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:48:23
banks would probably wire that for free.  However, a purchase like that could also be paid by check.

Are you in the us?

Honestly I think it's a bad idea unless you can get the actual service provider on board.
@_date: 2015-04-29 08:58:54
People have plenty of ways to access the internet tho.  
I'd prefer to see a service that would transparently connect users to whichever broadband service would provide them the best connection, regardless of where they are, and then just invoice them at the end of the month for their usage.
@_date: 2015-04-29 08:36:35
eh maybe it's a niche market then.  
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:54:50
I would see such a scheme resulting in higher prices by the internet companies.  
@_date: 2015-04-29 19:40:00
Also what's to stop someone from buying service from you for 15/ month and then reselling it for 5 dollars to 10 other people?  All of a sudden your network is being used by 100s of people.
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:11:47
Oh you want to resell your home internet that is sold to you for personal use to complete strangers?

Time warner partnered with a company to allow user's to do this a few years back.  Nothing really ever came of it.
[Timewarner cable partners with fon](
The press release doesn't mention it but they offered a option to allow access to your wifi for a fee, which IIRC, was split between the company and the owner of the access point.
@_date: 2015-04-29 07:59:52
In today's world, at least in America, I really just don't see the need.  When was the last time you had a need to buy internet access where this 'app' would had come in handy?
@_date: 2015-04-29 19:19:01
Right but that means your internet access would be more expensive so you would end up charging people more too.  Prices then go up for everybody.  
This scheme puts upward pricing pressures on the internet companies as they need to continue to invest in their network with less subscribers and revenue.  
@_date: 2015-04-29 07:48:19
It has been done.  Look up fon/fonero.  They even had a partnership with Time Warner Cable in the US.  I had one and nobody ever paid me to use it.  Looking at their website, they seem to no longer allow user's to sell access...I'm guessing that would because it wasn't very popular.
@_date: 2015-11-02 20:31:22

Still banks make most their money from lending.  I used to work at a bank and at the time the biggest money maker was mortgages.  Bitcoin is not going to make them obsolete in the foreseeable future.
As far as I am aware, western union is also not a bank.

Sentiment can matter quite a bit.  While it is still a much newer coin, there has been much more positive news about ETH in recent months compared to Bitcoin. 
Just do a comparison on google news between the two.  It's like night and day.

You think breakable encryption is not a vulnarability?  Also, per your logic, there is no reason to encrypt it in the first place.

Possibly more pumping of eth and more dumping of btc.  Eth has been receiving the type of news and interest from companies that btc users have wanted for btc for years.
 
@_date: 2016-07-18 13:38:47
Banks make much of their money by lending out money and charging interest.  How is bitcoin a threat to that?
To be honest, banks do a lot more than what you just said.


@_date: 2013-05-02 00:38:20
If your running a rom other than stock there is a good chance the developer might not have properly signed the apps.  If they used publicly available keys then apps can do things they normally wouldn't be able to do without asking for root access.
My tip: don't run a custom Rom unless you know it has been properly signed.
@_date: 2013-11-13 08:00:17
capital gains I think but its a higher rate if you hold less than a year.  I could be completely wrong too.
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:35:17
I usually get my  coins the day following the  bank debit.  So money leaves my account monday, get coins tuesday.  
Now...ach transactions which coinbase uses are reversible so the one day lag is totally acceptable to me especially since coinbase allows me to withdrawl those coins immediatley. 
The 24 hour limit exists because coinbase is fronting their own money for the purchase since they wont get your funds for a few days.
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:29:55
They should encrypt it IMO. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:03:41

This is all nice and well but we need companies that are able to provide this type of solution to companies.  You're asking Whole Foods to design and implement this themselves and that is not really their business.  We need to lower the barriers for companies and make it so simple it is a no brainer.
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:06:05
Many ROMs are also signed using default keys.  Don't quote me but I question whether this may allow apps to do things maliciously w/o needing to ask for root permission where they otherwise might need to had the ROMs been properly signed.

If companies are able to ensure your payroll is deposited by a certain date then so should coinbase.
Actually, the payroll company I work with is able to ACH deposit items the next business day if I need it on request, so should coinbase.  If I don't request it, they always guarantee no later than two days.  
Coinbase can predict with accuracy when it will hit your bank by and coinbase can do better.

Problem is that many people aren't even aware of mBTC or that bitcoin is divisible.  It'd be nice if the exchanges presented it as so.
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:54:23
well..then the value of bitcoin is what matters. Most companies accepting bitcoin will probably be converting it back to fiat.  If btc collapses, companies may still take it but it'll require more btc to make a purchase than it does today.
@_date: 2013-05-05 19:17:28
bitcoin won't be stable until the majority of common people are exchanging at units of less than 1 btc.

@_date: 2013-04-05 07:08:11
This is true however bitcoin has some as of now unimplemented methods that would allow coins to be only sent under certain conditions or allow a third party to control the distribution.  
I see BTC being a compliment to our current system.  Hopefully it retains value and you convert to cash when you to.  You can use it to pay for things at the swap meet, garage sales, or anywhere else you would use cash.
My big hope is that people are developing use cases and applications for bitcoin because of the current hype.  I also hope more websites and stores find ways of accepting it.  It could really change the way we do some things today if the right applications/products are developed.
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:47:51
I agree it is odd and quite unfair to the person purchasing.  They really should be holding the bitcoin from withdrawl for a period of time if they think it is high-risk IMO...kind of like paypal.
Having said this, This seems to be only happening to a small set of their users and less and less people are complaining about it.  Also, some have been able to resolve the issue by emailing them so that is good news.

Better to buy and hold.  The price has tended to rebound pretty fast these days and the drops are much shallower.
@_date: 2013-04-01 10:04:17
I don't think anyone here can tell you one way or the other as it is really uncharted territory. 
It could be a bubble waiting to burst or it could be something else..I think it really depends if the community is able to continue the momentum which probably won't be done unless developers continue to simplify Bitcoin for the end users.  Places like coinbase are a good start...we'll have to see what else develops.
Whether to invest...that is something you'll have to decide for yourself.  You can always purchase a small amount(ie:less than 1btc) for fun.
Just my $.02
@_date: 2013-04-02 05:29:29
Do you offer white-labels?
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:39:39
The price of Bitcoin at the time of the sale and the time they are to be released seems to have no bearing on whether a transaction is deemed high risk.    Plenty of people have been thankful for coinbase deeming them high risk and cancelling their order after the price dropped, allowing them to try again for cheaper. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:50:52
happy for you.

The picture you linked to really confuses me and probably who ever at coinbase viewed it.  .  It makes out like you are confusing the verification deposits with coinbase not depositing your money.
I'd send them a nice email simply stating that your funds have not posted to your account and ask gor them  to confirm what day they were sent.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:48:29
They also don't notate cancelled orders on the order history export report.  It makes everything so confusing!

Here is the link I was referring to.  The author is saying that he had the feeling that Satoshi never anticipated pools (which is entirely possible IMO, even if it seems obvious now to run one).
Whether Satoshi forsaw pools or not I guess can only be something he can answer unless we can uncover past messages with him discussing it.
Also - I have no idea how pools are implemented within the protocol if at all but maybe that can give some insight.
