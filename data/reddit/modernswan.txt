We have got a meme meister in here.
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:32:51
I myself never cared about these FUDs lol.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:54:05
This was really funny. A cross between Three Stooges humour and my wife saying hello to me (good mood or not).
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:57:17
I wish the original meme was animated. Can we get that animated ? No ? Alright.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:18:37
Ok, well we'll come put a blanket on you when you fall asleep on the couch.. :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:56:22
I feel like I should have seen a Fight Club meme here, but I didn't. Sigh.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:29:14
Nah leave it, gives douche bags like me something to be proud about pointing out.
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:29:33
What if there was debit card for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:56:46
Can't wait for it to release 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:50:37
First Chuck E Cheese, now this.. stop confusing the public!! /s Seriously, it looks really amazing. What's on the other side ?
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:56:55
Sweet. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:18:04
I've even seen some icos with minimum buys way beyond my investment capabilities. I prefer the way EOS is doing things.

I can't buy more when all of my money is in crypto :D
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:15:44
Haha never even looked at that.. oh, now I feel bad.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:55:41
&lt;checks apps&gt; Hey, that's not the current price of a bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:04:38
If it's gonna reach 16-17k then I will probably sell because there will be another dip as well.
@_date: 2018-05-01 06:00:26
Hahah hell yes.

They turn over banking info all the time. Here's [one example]( I know I've read about even more, the DEA went in there too under the excuse of cartel money or some non-sense and got all they wanted.

Happy that you added it to your store, however, I tested going through the buying process and after selecting Coinbase and then complete order, I got this error:
    {"errors":[{"type":"authentication_error","message":"No such API key.","reason":"no_such_api_key"}]}

@_date: 2018-02-15 23:05:49
Nice. Hopefully you have a plan to get them listed in front of people that might be looking to use. CL, meetups, etc. You should post updates every 30 days or something to see how things are going, and if it isn't working out, maybe the community can brain storm some solutions.
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:56:57
Good Luck with your venture, it's fantastic. Good way to get more adoption.
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:09:27
"Thank you for admiting you are into crypto by paying taxes with it. This audit is purely random."
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:06:00
I think stories like yours are probably the most important to bitcoin adoption. Thank you for sharing.
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:02:05
Well, not a great scenario, but it'll make you f-in hungry to succeed which I respect. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:28:14
Erm.. anti-money laundering laws are only annoyances, and literally deter 0 criminals from benefiting financially from their deeds.  In fact, those laws don't stop banks and large corporations either. Once in awhile they parade some shmuck in the media to convince themselves it all works.  Meanwhile, places like iTunes launder more money than anyone can fathom. 
I'm not pro-criminals, I am saying money laundering laws are useless.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:10:14
No problem. Also, try not to think of all the people masturbating to your voice, it's not important at all.
@_date: 2018-02-23 08:29:21
Very nice, would like to see a "stats" page where we could various countries represented with the data you collect. (ie. Out of the 20 banks submitted, 12 are friendly. Or Canada has 75% more friendly banking options than the US, etc). Data is fun!
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:42:47
Just why support such a shit company ? They manipulate prices, in bed with bitcoin cash, and are corrupt as hell. Do what you like, but weigh your decisions regarding money with more than just convenience and profit.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:59:16
This made me both happy.. and then sad.

@_date: 2018-02-08 20:40:09
Please don't use coinbase, for so many many reasons, the biggest is that they will not allow you to cash out as a Canadian. Use QuadrigaCX, they have higher fees, but they have a lot of options once you complete the KYC stuff.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:13:07

Haha a whole new wave of buyers to be comforted by a whole new wave a hardened and grizzled hodlers!
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:31:29
Here Here. Very well said.  People are just so conditioned to believe that whatever laws are put in place are for the greater good and question nothing.
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:54:49
I could be wrong, but I think people trade in and out of usdt assuming it's actually usd. But if it's vapor and has 0 value, then it will create a panic sell across all coins and people trying to get back to fiat as a safe haven. Something like that.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:55:15
Err.. I don't think I could ever recommend Tron again, sold it awhile ago for EOS and never looked back.
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:06:03
I think the crypto only exchanges would experience a huge exodus to fiat exchanges (or anywhere) willing to cash them out until the carnage subsides and the FUD dies down.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:56:53
Wait, he got all he needed to know from his niece ? Is.. is.. is that how policy is made ?

No, some water-cooler talk says it's going to get pushed down further before the next futures contracts expire.. 17th i believe ? so expect ups and downs and downs.
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:32:39
Wow, that's a beautiful sentiment. Feel like that should immortalized in a meme.
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:51:41
I don't believe there are any. None that are reputable anyway. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:15:46
Hmm.. something not going away not matter how hard they try.. reminds me of something.. lol
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:31:38
You can't let these ups and downs get to you, emotional investing is a straight shot to 0.  Just tell yourself, there will always be another trade. That's my 2c.
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:40:20
Haha no problem, just want you to succeed!
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:47:26
Good Luck, is for a lot of bitcoins he bought when they were $20 ?
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:58:14

I was really hoping it was the band, would be more credible.
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:28:17
Does this need to be a rule ? Is something someone would have to consult in case of confusion ? What kind.. I mean the world is.. gahh.

Just to play devil's advocate, Wal-Mart is essential when you are poor as fuck. All other factors aside, if you have $100 to buy groceries and household items, you'll get by shopping at Wal-Mart.. Wholefoods.. not so much. I'm not defending the system, but it's just another realistic layer of the problem.
@_date: 2018-04-10 02:51:18
Shh.. I think they meant the new, coming wealth. WINK.

Seems impractical as they would eventually have to convert to fiat and there begins a paper trail. I guess.
