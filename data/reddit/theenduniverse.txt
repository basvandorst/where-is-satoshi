Can I use this up vote for personal gain or possibly treasure or is it dedicated only to one thing

Listen I like to pad my hodlings with soft, lost keys man
@_date: 2019-06-11 10:36:44
Possibly not until I've found out the answer to my question but if I don't I'm not mad either so that's okay too

What if I told you the value of your currency was worth as much as was assigned to it?
@_date: 2019-02-18 08:27:47
The value of Bitcoin is one son.

The price of any unit is the same for all.

Facebook is not a social sharing platform, it is a business designed to make revenue, it is not platform to say anything you wish, it is a platform so you can make them more money.

For one explicitly going against the wishes of a person to expose them in order to clear up confusion seems to be a morally gray area.  it's about as ambiguous as how much ownership does an original creator have over their idea once given to the public to utilize.  what necessity to the invention or system does it solve to expose the DNA of its creator probably none you won't get more answers from him.  Therefore you're only solving an extraneous issue.  Not only that it is explicitly against the wishes of the person being subject to the experience they're trying to avoid.

Sounds like you're saying it's a valid record, not a valid fact.

I see, so it's not actual transactions, it's lowest attempted price to sell vs. highest amount actually paid?  The average is determined by the average of these markets?
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:20:15
Thanks, you had me freaked out for a minute that somehow one of the variables in the average price was not a completed sale.
So X = lowest sale, Y = highest sale, given day.  It still leaves me wondering how the average is supposed to rise **substantially** without a huge influx of buyers (demand).  I can see most people paying slightly more than average, and keeping the trend going for that day, into the next, but I don't see this as being a substantial increase in average without a truly heavy demand.

A piece of sliced bread could stop Bitcoin from having a value, man, or maybe rocket fuel for space crafts, or some high fashioned video game where you are the star of your own movie and explode the world.  The only thing that is unstoppable is The Beatles music, because of the type of instruments they play, or maybe a good sandwich you remember for a long time, bro.  They say if you put your ear up to the air, you can still hear those gentle drumbeats and smooth, sultry notes.

But only of an actual purchase, right?  The market is not averaging it's lowest listed price vs. the highest price someone paid on that market?  It's averaging the total of completed transactions, I'm assuming.
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:14:14
That's why I ask the question, an investor wants to buy cheap, what incentive is there for loads of people to pay significantly more than the average?  It would seem the only real way for the price to rise is bit by bit, as most people will buy only slightly higher than average.

Mathomatics, brother, and physical chemistry, perhaps one of those indestructible data cubes that have been invented. 
 
Then buy ocean futures, bro.
