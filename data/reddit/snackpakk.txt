Considering the advantages over the other alts (complete anonymity), I'm betting on Darkcoin...especially once the darkmarket opens.

Got an 06 Cayman S for BTC sale with your name on it! :-)

Yeah, serious but perhaps poorly worded. 
I guess what I'm asking is, in the chance that Gox did rebrand, how do they feel the community wouldn't hold them responsible for the missing coins? Things that I read seem to make me believe that they are manipulating the market to buy back the coins they lost. 
Seems like it would be like a bank closing for a few weeks, changing their name and then re-opening to say "oh we don't have anyone's money now bc we are a different company" (minus all the regulations and FDIC)

I'm in the upstate and have pretty deep BTC roots. Care to share more info about your startup?
@_date: 2014-02-02 01:01:43
Gotcha. Anything I can do to help?
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:30:53
I'd be very curious how this sale actually goes down...I'm curious because I'm looking to sell my Cayman S and would love to be able to have the seller pay in BTC!

Not sure but I can report that I tried to withdraw &lt;1 BTC from coinbase about 1.5 hrs ago and it isn't even in the blockchain yet and is just listed as "pending" in my coinbase acct. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 21:35:42
wow! Thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:39:29
Very cool - I've been following/trading/mining BTC for several years now. Keep me posted!
@_date: 2016-05-30 12:37:00
What changes did you make to the spreadsheet?
@_date: 2013-08-22 16:33:29
So how did you manage to get away with so many chargebacks and such without losing a ton? Do you still sell?
@_date: 2013-08-22 16:29:45
Source? My understanding was you forgo seller protection by offering a digital good but the buyer will always have protection.

Thanks! That is exactly what I was thinking. They use Bitpay as their POS for BTC payments. Personally, I've never used bitpay but it seems pretty straight fwd. I entered and re-entered my email address and a payment address was generated. The reps at [Private Internet Access]( just keep telling me "oh, not our problem, you need to contact bitpay"...Once I opened a ticket, they just ask for stuff like the "sent from" address which made no sense to me. I've lost faith in them and their service at this point, especially considering they haven't rendered my services and the amount I would pay now in BTC would be half of what I paid just a couple days ago...

awesome shirts! I can't drop $20 on one right now but you best believe as soon as I can, I'll be getting one for me and all of my friends!
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:05:19
And the worst part is during that 2 week period, they've had no issues pulling $10k+ out of my bank account each time I buy!
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:59:27
Consider yourself lucky...I've been waiting for a withdrawal for nearly 2 weeks now. Support just says the same thing..."please be patient"

Is there a recommendation (for both WIN and OSX) as far as scanning software goes so that those already in the game can scan their systems to check for any infiltration or vulnerabilities?
@_date: 2013-08-22 16:25:46
Are you sure the "unable to decide in your favor" message wasn't for you? How can you see what they were saying to the scammer? 
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:41:30
Thanks for the info. I hope you're right! I'm going on 3 days now and nobody there seems to be able to tell me anything more than "you need to call bitpay"...

I've always gotten a response from their customer service within 24-36 hours in the past. However, they have completely stopped responding now...
