Speculative business ventures that rely on venture capital to exist, they have yet to mine an asteroid or do any surveying for that matter.

I went browsing for the tweet that said pretty much that so I could post it here and then got sidetracked. This might make me a bad person, but probably just makes me a lazy person.
EDIT: And, really, it explains why the system we have today appears to be a mish mash of things that make no sense. Most of human societal history can be viewed the same as the evolutionary process and the biological creatures that result - it has all been like trying to build a car, while it is running and driving down the road. It won't look like a feat of precision engineering if those are the constraints you find yourself in. Does this mean it can't be improved? Of course not. But, much like a car driving down the road, you can't just pull the engine out and replace it - you will have to engineer a way to put this new engine in while the car is still running.
But, noooooo. It's just an illuminati conspiracy to hold the geniuses around here down. smh

The above post seems almost unconcerned with manipulation and no negative consequences for said manipulation. That was the point, not that it was or was not possible.

This should just be the bitcoin catchphrase/motto, because it is literally said every time someone takes issue with the technology and/or community surrounding the technology. Think about it now:
A 30 second commercial plays on national television, in it some really hot, half naked chick is buying some crazy shit online, and then it flashes to a guy in another room, buying some banal stuff, then it flashes to a guy looking at a trading screen with a boner because of a bullish market, then screen fades to black, and suddenly in bright golden lettering you see, "Bitcoin: Any New Technology Has Complications When It Is First Introduced".

If served with a gag order on the investigation or parts of the investigation, Karpeles would be forced to not say anything about the matter, as well.
To me, it looks like all coins were stored in one location/"account"/"wallet" (or a significant portion at least), and one of the people (could have been anyone - Shrem, some unnamed person, whatever) using Gox became under investigation, and then the entire "wallet" holding all of the coins was seized. Since Karpeles couldn't talk about the matter, he was forced to make explanations outside of the truth, since the truth (the entire "wallet" was seized and we or someone we service are under investigation) would send him to federal prison.
The "found" coins on the order of 200,000 worth could simply be coins that were cleared by the feds and allowed to be used to continue the business.
EDIT: Loved how I got downvoted for this lol. This sub makes no sense.

Oh yeah sorry I like reality a bit too much to think I am living in a sci fi movie. We don't even have the technology to mine asteroids - case in point, if we did, we would be doing it.
Where's my flying car again?

You are an idiot.

I thought the whole idea behind bitcoin is that it is a "down with central banking" thing, I must be in the wrong subreddit then. This is still correct?

The cost of mining on asteroids far outweighs any benefits considering the technology doesn't exist, so it would have to be developed, and THEN we would have to survey asteroids, etc etc. There are far too many resources far more easily available on the planet. Even starting wars for them is less costly than what it would cost to mine in space - as far as we know, since the technology doesn't exist.

What is this, some kind of hivemind persecutory complex? I was talking about the user's comment that I replied to, and now you are saying I am talking about all of you, or something.
There's a discussion going on here, please stay on topic and do try to keep up. Fuckin' a man.

Didn't hurt me at all, I've been a skeptic from the start. I am naturally skeptical of anything that promises to be the next Jesus. History has shown there is no easy answer to pretty much anything.
Sticking to idealism and wishing away reality doesn't change reality, but it does open you up to manipulation.

We haven't been to the moon in over 40 years, and I don't think anyone is (seriously) looking into mining asteroids any time in the next 50. We don't even have space-faring surveying tech to do this, and it would all need engineered.
There will be no space mining in our lifetimes.

...no, I'm not. My original post was about ideological backpedaling, and how for some people here who may support the stance that bankers are evil manipulators who belong in jail because a bunch of people lost money, they are perfectly fine that prices on exchanges can be manipulated and just write it off that a bunch of people lost money and that's not a big deal.
I swear I am saying the same thing every time, and I know what words mean, so please read my posts before replying.
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:30:07
So wait, I don't get it - a lot of people here hate banks because they supposedly blew up prices of assets artificially, and then a bunch of people lost money.
How would something like this not be the same?
The ideology backpedaling is priceless in this sub.
