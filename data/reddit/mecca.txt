You legitimately care about imaginary cakedays. Don't hit your head leaving the basement.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:53:57

I started with peanuts now my portfolio is 98% of my net worth. Hard to get attached to it since it came from peanuts. It's a nice feeling.

"hey man here's your drug money back sorry you got caught up in the downfall of a criminal enterprise."
 Apparently buying illegal stuff online is illegal. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:32:24
Shhhh. It'll be ok.

TIUL (today I unfortunately learned) founder here. I'm kind of a big deal. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:38:40
Yeah who the hell says that 
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:58:59
You're as dumb as the other guy, I see now why you rushed in. Enjoy your year dummy.

Apparently everyone enjoyed winky FBI troll face.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:58:41
Well clearly I don't care about the person. You cared enough to come to his defense, I think this is on you. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:52:04
Yes, criminal intent is a thing for a reason. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:17:57
Are you the TIF founder? If so, wow.

What the actual fuck are you talking about? It's a fucking non-profit that focuses on LGBT issues. That's it. It literally has nothing to do with anything you just mentioned. Property rights? Are you fucking drunk? 
There isn't a difference of opinion here, you and your friends, for very apparent reasons, are upset someone supported an organization dealing with LGBT issues.
I'm sorry someone donating to a charitable organization is so upsetting to you. Please take shelter in your safe space, the real world won't always be as awful as you want.

So tired of these posts. No one ever cares why you cashed out. It's just your time to jerk yourself off in front of us. Who's next? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:15:52
You find it sad that someone would support a charitable organization fighting for equality. 
You might just be a piece of shit.

Careful, if he gets wind of this we can expect Bitcoin to be banned within the month.

Think almost every coin is now built on ethereum.

Until the government says otherwise, all of this is perfectly legal. So yes, he is legally entitled to his money. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 06:09:35
You're fine. You just have some waiting to do.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:13:53
Very true.

Binance worries me. It's relatively new, untested. Pretty much every exchange gets hacked or loses funds.

You poor kids are so easily rustled. It's a joke, because Trump is a raging narcissist. Calm your fat tits. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:31:31
You poor child. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:31:36
An opposite opinion of equal rights? Do you even realize what you're saying?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:08:35
Settle down child. It's just a joke. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:55:34
So you want a national non-profit to focus on international efforts? There are other organizations for that. Lambda Legal provides free legal representation and advocacy for those that need it in the US. They're entirely funded by supporters. 
It's ok that you're against any "left leaning agenda". You don't know any better, but don't lash out at others for doing a good deed. 
Try to contain your MAGA views to the_donald, you'll find much more support there.

I wouldn't give a shit because what people do with their own money isn't a fucking concern of mine. Moron.

Bitcoin is about as anonymous as me writing my social security number on a dollar. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:30:07
Bad news, you and whomever is talking to are fucking ignorant of both Bitcoin and the law.
