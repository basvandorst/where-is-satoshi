Dunno exactly, but this doesn't look natural. Price went up 2k since this monday and it is going higher with very low volume.
Whatever it is, I already sold at 11,350, I'll wait for the next correction.

I discovered the cure to my worries about bitcoin dropping. Trade altcoins. Now I don't even check bitcoin price, all I do is trade altcoins to accumulate more bitcoin. It will go up eventually, meanwhile I'll try to get more.

The video-game industry is MASSIVE. The first crypto able to break in the industry is going to be really important.
That's one of TRON's objectives, actually, I read somewhere an example that said "Imagine you could sell a weapon in Team Fortress 2 for TRON and then use that same TRON to buy a skin in CS:GO". I hope this happens some day, whatever crypto it is.
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:48:08
Yes, 7,800 totally possible. I feel like we might see it at the end of this week
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:49:37
Last week I learned that I can trade altcoins vs bitcoin/ethereum. It's been liberating because now I am not glued to the screen watching the price of Bitcoin vs FIAT. For example there was a huge dip yesterday/today and I don't even care. I'm just trading altcoins to accumulate more bitcoin, without caring about the current price. It will go up eventually, and by that time I will have more bitcoin than before.

I have always said that TA is a self-fulfilling tool.
If a lot of people follow TA and they all sell at the same time and buy at the same time, no shit the price is going to react the way you think it is going to react.

This thread is most likely going to be deleted but still, I think the gaming and smart contracts projects are the ones that are going to stand out. It is already happening with TRON, and there's also a new ICO called Ethearnal, a decentralized freelancing platform.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:42:14
Yet there are some great and needed projects like the freelancing platform Ethearnal that even has a working MVP struggling to get 200 ETH. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 03:02:48
Ok so if Tether is "bad" then how do you protect yourself from a dip? The way I see it is: buy bitcoin at, for example, 10k. Then bitcoin goes to 11k, you think there's a dip coming, you sell BTC for tether, you have 11k tether. Then bitcoin dips to 10.2k, then you use the tether to buy bitcoin again.
But without tether?

"fasten your seatbelts" with a Bitcoin/other cryptos logos. Seriously tho, fukin 10-25% variations within a day, this is a crazy ride.
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:54:15
Fuck I'm retarded. Took me longer than it should have to process that it said "DROPS $1K" and not "DROPS TO $1K". I was already thinking "goddamn this is some GOOD FUD"
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:35:01
Well I am obviously talking for myself, but I just entered the crypto market last week.
So I bought BTC when it was at 11k, and I am sure as hell increasing my position right now. But yeah I see your point, a lot of people is only bluffing.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:15:26
T O T H E M O O N
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:24:23
Meh, it happens the other way around too. I was holding my position since 7.2k~~ and I sold at 8.4k~, and as soon as I sold it went up to 9k, feels bad man.
Good thing I already bought again at 8.3k, now we wait.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:08:24
It is true. There's an announcement about it:
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:44:49
People most likely sell on Fridays cuz they can't be bothered checking the markets on weekends, so they rather be out of it.
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:38:04
*Sans music plays*
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:59:16
Yeh, that's something I have learned. Sometimes is even harder to sell and then watch the price go up, than to buy and watch it go down. The FOMO is real. But we will get better every time.
Last time this happened, I sold at 11.3k~ and then it went up to 11.8k, that sucked, and when the correction started, I was too anxious and bought at 11,400, little did I know it was going to drop all the way to 9.5k. So this time I will wait a little longer before I buy again.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:16:59
Less than 48 hours ago it was at 9.4k. This is nothing, just relax. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:54:03
So, masa para tamales arroz and salsa huh? Soriana?

And with that username, goddamn. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:21:58
Bro for only checking the prices every 3-4 months to rebalance your portfolio you sure spend a shitload of time on this sub
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:46:39
Well THAT's interesting. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:53:46
A trader would trade whatever as long as there is supply and demand. You dont need to be a crypto-believer to get into this market.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:02:22
Holy FUCK! The market is getting completely destroyed. It's actually kind of funny.
If I had any money lying around I would be buying the shit out of some coins. Too bad I bought at the beginning of the month.
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:38:08
That feel when you don't understand shit about the markets but you still create a thread trying to tell other people what to do.
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:58:09
I bought at 11,400 thinking it was going to drop until 11,300 or something. Then it dropped to 11,000 lmao. Whatever, I will just have to hold 1 more day to start seeing profits
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:25:09
When I first started in crypto, I used to sell as soon as the price started dropping, that's how I lost around 30% of my initial investment. Now I am just going to hold (not "hodl", that sounds pretty stupid), taking into consideration that 10 days ago the price was at 8.5k, so in comparison is not that dramatic.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:18:33
Yes, getting closer to my entry point.
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:59:48
I am fine with this even if it is not directly related to bitcoin. It's still interesting
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:52:07
You are most likely trying to catch the train. You are not supposed to buy when the price is already rising, and you are not supposed to sell when it is going down.
You gotta set buy and sell prices. And respect them. If you fuck up then you hold. I know this because it happened to me and I lost 30% of my initial investment. Now after learning from it I have recovered around 18%. I'm still down, but learning.
For example, I was holding from 7.2k, once it got to 8.6k I sold. And then I watched it go up until almost 9k, but I didn't buy, because I'd have been chasing the train. I waited for it to drop again, and I bought at 8.3k. And then it dropped to 7.8k, but I didn't sell, I waited. Now I just sold at 9.2k and it's going up even more. But that doesn't matter, because I am going to wait to see what the market does.
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:12:27
When I first started with crypto these dips made me panic sell like a total bitch, that's how I lost 30% of my initial investment.
Now I just think 2 things, first "Fuck I bought too soon, should have waited a little longer for a better price" and "fuck I wish I had some more cash laying around to average down". Either way feels bad man, I will just have to hold for a little longer now
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:38:08
Yes it is. Most of the dip was caused because of the Binance shit (as well as the "natural" correction after failing the 12k test), once Binance gets that sorted out it will go back up.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:54:26
It is not about the price, it's about the value. If every business accepted bitcoin, if you could pay your mortgage, insurances, groceries, entertainment, everything with bitcoin, nobody would use "fiat". Even if bitcoin was at 10 usd each.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:04:08
10% is 10%. I mean, only you can answer that question. Are you ok making 800 usd~ per trade? Or is it not worth your time unless you were making 8k per trade.
This is just an example, implying you will be making 10% on each trade. Of course you can still get rekt by day trading.
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:22:20
If it passes 10k is gonna rise even more. A lot of people will be confident if it breaks the 10k resistance.
If it doesn't, then it's going to have a bit of a fall to find support.
Oh, and I don't think is gonna break 10k, at least not yet.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:09:43
It is taking its goddamn time too. Been waiting for it to hit 9k so I can sell...since I think once it hits 9k it will drop a bit, maybe 8.3k~
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:50:21
"HODLer", "normie vs crypto memes".
Seriously, this is the type of shit we dont need in this community.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:50:13
You can buy 50 USD or 5,000 USD. We are not talking about numbers, we are just talking about this being a good opportunity to buy. Each one knows if they can buy and how much. After all a 10% increase in price is a 10% increase. Your 50 USD would be worth 55 or your 5k, 5.5k.
@_date: 2018-02-19 21:54:09
Now that you edited your OP...
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:16:12
Waiting for BTC to drop to 8.5k~~ before going in hard.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:55:45
Smart strategy. Just stick to it and don't listen to your emotions.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:46:19
Conclusion: You are the one who is arrogant. Thinking you are better just because you are "hodling" against all the "FUD".
Seriously, grow up.
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:36:54
Did you even read the first line of text? Or just the title and that made you spit out that idiotic comment.
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:45:57
Seems like a good time to jump onto the stock market too then.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:04:39
I guess the price is stable enough to start buying the dips again. I've been holding since 7.2k, but I could have sold at 8.4-8.5k 2 times and buy again at 7.8k
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:47:19
"stability". Literally less than 24 hours at 10k.

@_date: 2018-02-19 21:16:13
Being right does not give you the right to brag about it. After all each person will do whatever they think is best. It's up to each person to be humble about it, since throwing it around is not healthy for the environment. 
It would be very different if, for example, and I am not telling you to do it, I wouldn't do it, you talked to those people and say something like "hey man, remember how you said bitcoin was going to 0 when it was 7k? Well it's 11k now, I still think it is a good time to buy in case you are interested"
Instead of "LOL NOOB YOU PEOPLE ARE SHEEP HAHA IM RICH NOW".
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:48:44
Bruh, if it went up 600% you are most likely too late to the party.
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:12:55
Ok enough is enough. I just bought some coin so expect the market to crash in the next minutes.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:34:36
I wouldn't touch point 3. You are at an introductory level so you should be more objective to be taken more seriously.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:25:35
That username tho, wtf
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:42:45
This is why we can't have nice things.
But honestly though, how can people still fall for shit like this. Once you read "GUARANTEED PROFITS", you already know it is a scam.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:13:22
Are you serious...
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:59:29
Telling the truth is not attacking...seriously a lot of people within the crypto communities need to be more objective or we are never going to be taken seriously.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:02:44
This drop was the most stupid shit I have seen in a long time. I mean, I am still profiting since I bought at 10k, but seriously? From 11,300 to 10,200 in like 5 hours? Cmon now
@_date: 2018-03-06 02:38:26
Yeah I see your point. But I guess it is the same as what the Bitcoin-believers fight for. Pretty much "fuck banks, decentralize everything". Maybe something similar could happen with the videogame industry. More opportunities for little companies to take over the AAA's
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:50:32
I sold at 9.2k, then it went up to almost 9.3 and now its back to 9.2 again. 
I sold because I am planning to buy again at 8.6~. Then again, this is just me following my gut. I feel like there is a certain pattern, that's why I am expecting it to go down a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:17:23
It's ok, now with your newly acquired commercial property you will be able to generate more income and then get on the train again...and then buy another commercial property later, who knows. Either way, gratz!
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:42:02
PSA: Using HODL makes you look stupid and the community as a whole. This is not a meme, it is supposed to be "the future", yet you have kids saying things like "IM HODLING FOREVER, LETZ GO TO THE MOON!!1"
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:12:38
Oh god...
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:39:41
Honestly, people like you are like bad advertisement. You can't be so close-minded disregarding everything that is not pro-bitcoin. You have yet to give a valid argument, you are only making insulting comments, maybe you are not smart enough to debate and all you can say is "CHECK THE MARKETZ EVERYONE IS ON THE TRAIN NOW".
Oh and before you start, I bought since 7.2k, so no, it won't feel worse for me, it's actually feeling real good right now. I am just pointing our that your "arguments" put bitcoiners in a bad spot.
