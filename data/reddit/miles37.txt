Wallet software could be altered so that you set a minimum and maximum fee rather than a strict fee, along with a number of blocks to wait and an increment. The wallet then tries to send the transaction, at the min fee, waits the set number of blocks to see if it is included, before cancelling the transaction and then trying to send again at min+incremement, until the transaction is either included in a block of the maximum fee limit is reached.

I think often, 'miner' refers to the person running the pool, as they are choosing what to mine, and the people pointed at the pool are referred to as 'hashers'.
In an actual mine though, all of the workers are called miners, and the one choosing what to mine is the foreman, so maybe something like that would be better.

Most of the money that they borrow is created in order to lend it to them.
The govt offers the bonds, at a higher interest rate than the rate set by the central bank for reserves. People then take out credit from the commercial banks (and those 'people' are often the commercial banks themselves) at a rate still lower than that offered by the govt, and use that credit to buy the bonds. In this way, the actions of the govt have led to the creation of new money, i.e. they have caused monetary inflation, i.e. they have devalued the money held by the European populace in order to transfer wealth to themselves. They have not done this on a promise to be productive either, which would have more than made up for it if they were successful, but rather on a promise to collect taxes from its national population in the future.
This is the same way money is created by most contemporary governments, including the U.S.A and U.K. They do so indirectly, but we obfuscate this by saying that they 'print money' (it is mostly not even printing, but creating entries in a digital ledger).
You can't do this with bitcoin: You can't just create new Bitcoin on demand. There is a finite amount of bitcoin created according to the software, and that is it. You can't devalue BTC holdings by extending credit. Governments can't devalue people's BTC holdings and transfer that wealth to themselves by selling bonds. If govts want the wealth held in BTC, they have to actually tax it directly, they cannot inflate the BTC... If a government borrows BTC, they are borrowing BTC which already existed, people can't just create new BTC in order to lend it to the govt. People CAN, and DO create new Euros in order to lend them to the govt. Central banks then pay their profits to their respective governments, reducing the cost for the government to 'print' this new money 'for itself'.
Edit note: The central bank will actually buy the government bonds. The central banks usually aren't allowed to buy govt bonds directly, so what happens is the central bank bids for govt bonds at x% markup on the price the govt is selling them for initially, and so this leads people to buy the bonds and then sell them to the central bank. Will find article explaining some of these techniques the govt/central bank uses to 'print itself money' tomorrow.

Would it be beneficial if wallets were made so that you can specify a transaction fee range?
So, first the wallet will try to broadcast the transaction with your minimum fee, e.g. 2mbits, then if it is not accepted in a certain amount of time, increase to 4 mbits, etc, until it reached your maximum fee (say 10mbits)? So there is an automatic bidding process, which prevents transactions either just getting stuck until you cancel them and then you having to re-broadcast them with a higher  fee manually, or you having to pay higher than you needed to in order to make sure your tx goes through (which if everyone was doing it could cause a fast skyrocketing of transaction fees).

The government can keep spending the people's money because it is not limited. They can just create more of it when they want, transferring wealth to themselves by devaluing the holdings of everyone else. They can't do that with Bitcoin.
Most people don't even realise they are being taxed by inflation, they don't realise that when the government prints money it takes wealth away from everyone else. With bitcoin the government would actually have to raise taxes, which is much more obvious.

Why is that? Left/right just refers to opposing sides. Originally it was two groups sitting either side of the King in the French revolution IIRC, the right was pro-establishment and the left was anti-establishment. The loudest voice on the left were some sort of communists I think, but there were other anti-establishmentarians among them; and on the right the loudest were the royalists, but there were others among them. Either side of the left/right divide are usually people of very different political views, but they band together and split down the middle to vie for the side which is least abhorrent to them in the struggle over power.
So, being that the origin was anti-establishment vs pro-establishment, the free-market decentralised marketplace vs the highly regulated ETF seems a fair left/right split. Anyway, the left/right only referred to them being on opposing sides, so really it could refer to anything.
I'm not saying it is a valuable distinction to be making in this case, nor that it will not be confusing to many people, just that I don't think it is actually *wrong*.
Edit: Or maybe it is wrong, since OpenBazaar and the Winklevoss ETF aren't actually directly opposed to each other, though one is working against the establishment's dictates and the other relies upon them so it is close.

It seems to me that Ghash.io has a limited understanding of what encompasses the market. The market comprises all voluntary interactions between individuals (hiring a hit-man is a market-exchange, the hitman executing isn't). Consumer awareness groups are as much a part of the market as the companies whose practises they are attempting to bring to light.
Claiming that you are a being punished for your success is like if: The ocean was commons, and one fishing company fished so hard that other people were not able to fish because doing so would wipe the fish out (&lt;-- this part is not as closely related to ghash/bitcoin as some other parts of my analogy turned out to be, so don't try too hard to understand it, it's just an equivalent situation), and eventually the fishing company would fish so much as to put itself out of business too, whilst a consumer awareness group was trying to inform the customers of the fishing company that by buying from that company, they are causing people to starve, and eventually will cause themselves to not be able to buy fish from anywhere too; so they're better giving their custom to a different fishing company, whose fish vary in price by 0.16% more than the irresponsible fishing company, because sometimes they have reduced supply (to avoid overfishing).
Ghash.io is like the company which is over-fishing the waters whilst other fishermen around them are fishing relatively responsibly. The hashers pointed at ghash are like the customers buying from ghash.io. Reddit is the consumer awareness group.
Perhaps the responsible mining pools could provide private open pgp keys to their customers to prove to Bitcoin companies that they are a member of a responsible mining pool, in exchange for an x% discount off their goods/services. We need to get something going like this, to incentivise responsible behaviour (also incentivises mining pools to be responsible, e.g. criteria may be that they hold &lt;5% of the hashing power, as the hashers will be incentivised to join those pools to receive their discount.). The bigger Bitcoin becomes, the more influence this will have. Changing the protocol is not the only solution, I am showing you 'outside the box'. Have a look around.

Also on the health thing.. Really I don't know and I don't think anyone knows for sure whether there is any potential negative health impact from nofapping, but lots of people experience positive health changes because of their increased motivation to self-improve following bnofap, e.g by eating healthily and exercising. There are cultures where people don't masturbate and don't even have a word for it (I read about one Pygmy tribe for example), but maybe these people have more sex to make up for it. 
The NHS (British State-ran National Health Service) website however states that there is no health requirement to masturbate, because the body will recycle sperm and release semen through nocturnal emissions as required, and there have been many people throughout history who have been outwardly against masturbation for long periods of time and not suffered any known health problems as a result from it.

However, I'm still buying on the way down as I don't know what will actually happen and I'm long, holding BTC for global reserve adoption.

As soon as any merchant who provides goods/services which I already consume for an approximately equal or better price begins accepting bitcoins, then I will switch to that merchant. E.g. if any of my 3 local supermarkets started accepting bitcoins, they would receive all of my groceries custom. I just won't go and expend value for the sake of using bitcoins, so.. increased merchant adoption is an essential prerequisite to increased use. I have already made switches to companies which accept bitcoins, but these are in areas where I spend very little money.

For there to be multiple payment processors: Either those multiple payment processors have to use the blockchain to move the bitcoins between each other, or multiple payment processors have to work together with one entity which holds the bitcoins whilst the payment processors just do accounting between each other.
If it's the latter, then that's not much better than there just being one payment processor, since in both cases there is a single entity in control of all the liquid bitcoins.
I say not *much* better, because then at least there would be multiple payment processors trying to hold the bitcoin holder to account, but still it's one entity which is in control of all the liquid bitcoins...

I think what he means is:
The bank types the money into existence, then lends you the money, and demands you pay it back with interest.
The money is indeed typed into existence by the National Central Bank, which loans it to the Commercial Bank at a lower interest than what it will charge you; sometimes the interest rate is zero, or even negative, meaning the National Central Bank pays the Commercial Bank to borrow money from it, with the stated intent that this will increase lending, motivated by the theory that that will benefit the economy. There is often a reserve requirement of ~2% I think, although instead of a reserve requirement some countries have a capital requirement, which is all their assets rather than only cash specifically.
So, the bank is effectively printing the money into existence, only specific licensed banks are allowed to do this, and then they are charging you to use this money which they didn’t earn, and devaluing everyone else’s money at the same time. This means a transfer of wealth from everyone else to the bankers, through counterfeiting, when the banks didn't do anything of value but only qualified for the regulations that allow it the privilege of counterfeiting.

What? By pegged I gather he means, like.. Where gold is used for $10 coins... You can only buy $10 worth of stuff with it so you are better to hold it and use the $10 paper money instead. Or, if you have a few $10 gold coins, you're better to keep the ones which haven't had the edges chipped off.
So, if someone enforced that a Bitcoin was only worth $10 in some place, but yet we can exchange it for $380 between ourselves, then we would not buy at their shop/market/country/taxes using Bitcoin, but their paper money or w/e instead.

Libertarians want the maximum individual freedom from initiatory violence. Different libertarians disagree on the best way to maximise freedom from initiatory violence however. If you are willing to cognizantly compromise freedom from initiatory violence then you are not a libertarian.
So you may think that without a minimal govt (courts, police, military) we would suffer more coercion from warlords in which case you can be a minarchist libertarian, even if your understanding of what would happen without a govt is mistaken. But there is no way you could rationally think that govt healthcare would increase freedom from coercion.

Security guards are providers of force-services, yet bow to market pressure thus disproving your argument. You can come up with a new argument if you want, but that specific one has failed.
Anyway: The government force-services are not subject to the market, because they do not operate within the market -- they hold a monopoly funded through extortion. Non-monopoly force services are subject to the market because they must compete for customers. If some non-monopoly force-service was extorting people, first those people would have guns in a free-market, but also then the people around them would want their own force-services to stop the extorters so they don't next come for them.

Anarchism is distinguished by the N.A.P ( What differentiates different anarchist schools of thought is their protocols for determining property rights (all anarchists support property rights, just different ways of deciding who has them). With polycentric anarchism (/anarchism without adjectives), these different anarchist schools of thought can live alongside each other in peace.
Everything is already based on majority consensus, and everything will always be based on majority consensus. Currently, the majority consensus is that the State has the legitimate right to do what it is doing, to hold elections, to tax, etc..
The way to end the State, or to change the way it runs, is to change people's minds so that the consensus changes...
If we can convince enough people in any given area -- whether consciously e.g. through explanation/argument, or subconsciously e.g. through financial incentives and technology -- that the N.A.P is something they should follow, then we can get consensus on that, and that is how we will have anarchy just as it is how we have the State as we have it today.
I recommend reading the Wikipedia page on the N.A.P that I linked you to understand the answers to your questions. With the NAP, minorities have as much rights as anyone else.

You're an individual human being who has the capacity to control his own thoughts, and through doing so you can change your character in remarkable ways, finding yourself doing things through habit which you never previously imagined yourself capable of. Even for a person already in debt, there are ways of raising the capital required for your business. I'm not going to tell you what those ways are: it's no use if you don't have the will and the belief anyway, but if you do have the will and the belief you will find the way yourself.
If you want to be rich, I recommend you pick up a copy of the original 'Think and Grow Rich' by Napoleon Hill. Through your business you can help solve those issues which are pertinent to you, and then with the money you make do so even further.
All the best to you my good man, success starts with a positive mental attitude.

Did you see that post from the guy who got scammed by Moolah? Moolah (Alex Green) is a sociopath.
The only way you could know if he's a solid guy is if you've studied sociopathy, and hardened yourself to their bullshit through practise. If you're just a regular non-sociopath who hasn't studied them, then you can not know if he is a solid guy or not. Maybe if you would live with him 24/7 for a month you would know, because they can struggle to keep their act up for such long periods and you're more likely to notice glitches in the matrix which they weave for you.

@_date: 2014-05-17 12:43:27
O.K. I might be wrong (whether entirely or in part), but this is what I'm thinking (broken into number points): 
1) The reason why Bitcoin transactions could hypothetically become expensive is if there were to remain at 1mb once transactions exceed 7/second. The reason why blocks might be kept at 1mb is to allow regular guys to run nodes. The reason why regular guys are helped to run nodes by a 1mb block side is because bandwidth is scarce, and relaying the blockchain costs bandwitdth. One big reason why we would want regular guys to run nodes is because with fewer bigger nodes, Bitcoin would be more easily interfered with by governments.
2) If someone has 1mb disposable bandwidth, then he can only use that for either Bitcoin or an altcoin, so if people are using altcoins for micro transactions then people are running nodes for that which could otherwise be operating as Bitcoin nodes. If someone is going to run 2 nodes, they might as well have doubled their disposable bandwidth, allowing the Bitcoin block size to be doubled and removing the cause for altcoins. If he is stopping running a Bitcoin node in order to run an altcoin node, then he is sacrificing the security of Bitcoin, which is the whole reason why we have a limited blocksize anyway (to allow regular guys to benefit the security of Bitcoin) so we might as well remove the limit.

Let them be, it'll work itself out in time. Currently I think it's a lot of early adopters spending the bitcoins with merchants, which is driving down the price but also boosting awareness of Bitcoin, and strengthening the infrastructure and adoption. Once they start to run out of bitcoins they're happy to spend, the sell-pressure will decrease against buying pressure as more of the spending is coming from people who are buying back in with their paychecks whilst still using Bitcoin as a transaction method too.
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:05:21

Negative right: "Person X must be allowed to use the properties of certain resources. If anyone prevents x from using those resources, he will be shot."
Or, "If anyone copies person X's idea, that person will be shot."
Rights only exist to the extent that people decide they should, and are then willing and able to enforce them.

"The American Letter Mail Company was started by Lysander Spooner in 1844, competing with the legal monopoly of the United States Post Office (USPO, now the USPS) in violation of the Private Express Statutes. It succeeded in delivering mail for lower prices, but the U.S. Government challenged Spooner with legal measures, eventually forcing him to cease operations in 1851."

These are my thoughts, I'd like to hear your response:
Inflation pushes people to invest in order to not lose value.
In a deflationary economy, people will only invest where they think they will see higher returns than simply sitting on their money.
If everyone is investing just to not lose their money, there are likely to be more bad investments.
If people don't need to invest and only do so because they are confident they will make more than by sitting on their money, there are likely to be less bad investments.
Investing means allocating resources. When resources are unallocated, they are cheaper, meaning everyone can live more prosperously. When resources are allocated effectively, productive efficiency is increased so that people can live even more prosperously; but when resources are allocated ineffectively, resources are wasted and everyone can live less prosperously.
There is no need for so much investment, people can live comfortably as they are, even more comfortably the less investment there is, and then if people have this comfort they will be more likely to carefully assess where they allocate their resources.
Also, if people are wealthier because resources are cheaper due to being unallocated through investment, each person is actually in a better position to invest themselves should they choose to, despite the reduced incentive to do so because of inflation.
Thank you for posting the Wikipedia link, but I think that sort of deflation is different (though I'm not sure), because in those cases, due to the interest-bearing debt-based nature of contemporary fiat currencies, it's not just that there is less money available to use to trade resources with because people are saving it: In those cases, people are actually reallocating resources to banks as they pay off interest on the money, and so becoming less prosperous whilst the supply decreases, not more so. If you look at those examples, they are all about credit contraction, which means that people are still paying off the interest but not getting more money out with which to do that.
In interest-bearing debt-based money-systems, people can only pay off the debt on the existing money if they borrow further money, whereas in Bitcoin this is not the case. I will have to give more thought to this to really understand the comparisons and contrasts between the two situations, perhaps I will write an article on it if I get the time to really work it out.
Thanks for provoking my thoughts.

People were able to save money by purchasing Bitcoin and then spending it, so there is as much incentive to buy as to sell.
Under normal BTC merchant adoption scenarios this is not the case (you will not save money by buying BTC for the purpose of spending it), so there is net sell-pressure.
This is ignoring other factors such as publicity which also factor in to supply/demand.

Ahhhhh there is a big difference. It's not a problem that people with money loan it out to others and take interest. What is a problem is when the few licensed banks are allowed to counterfeit money and credit it to people and take interest. In Bitcoin lending, people can only lend their own money; in current 'lending'(crediting) banks are effectively stealing money from everyone, then loaning that out and charging interest on it...

"The key difference is that there has also never been the birth of a new financial paradigm before"
This statement is definitely false.
"any other time in history when a market has grown exponentially for 5 years straight they would be right"
I do not know for sure, but I expect this statement is also false.
When people first started to use any form of money at all, that was also a new financial paradigm, and it's not unreasonable to expect that may have grown exponentially for 5 years as well; never minding more recent examples such as digital fiat provisions like credit-card companies.

@_date: 2014-07-21 08:44:02
Do you realise what investing is? Investing is allocating resources. If you do not invest your bitcoins but hodor them, the resources still exist, it just means that they are cheaper for everyone because they aren't being used by whomever you might have allocated them to through your investment. You've already earned the use of those resources through the value you provided in exchange for the bitcoins, so you have already created wealth.
When someone invests money, they are allocating resources there, so the resources become more expensive for everyone else in whom you didn't invest. If people who don't want to invest, do invest, they are less likely to be good at investing, and therefore more likely to waste resources by investing ineffectively, meaning that the bitcoins of the skilled investors will be worth less resources and thus their good investments will be less impactful.
The boom-bust cycle is caused by bad investments, because people who aren't good at investing allocate resources to people who will not use them effectively, and so when the bad investments fail, they waste resources and make them more expensive for everyone else making everyone poorer.
For a person to have bitcoins which he might invest in the first place, he has to have provided value in exchange for them, why should he have to work more by then investing them?
The investment which occurs in our economies really is excessive, it seems normal because of the environment which leads to it, but it really is not a good thing.

It's a big difference: being anti-semitic is being racist, disliking people because of a condition which they were born with, which doesn't have any significant impact on their *practical* likability (i.e. how they actually behave etc, as opposed to one's skewed perception/prejudice).
Being anti-Judaism is disliking people because of a world-view they have, which they maintain by choice (whether they were originally indoctrinated into it as children or not), and which has a significant impact on their actions and thus their *practical* likability.
Being anti-Judaism is like being anti-Islam, anti-Nazi, anti-Fascist, anti-Communist, anti-Capitalist, anti-Feminist, etc... This is very different to being racist, clearly. Being anti-semitic on the other hand is like being anti-black-genes, anti-chinese-genes, anti-Indian-genes (using genes to differentiate from people representing the State of China, etc.. which is more similar to anti-Judaism).

It's not actually any more difficult... You're just not used to working it out  that way, but you are used to working it out the other way, since you have been involved in Bitcoin since before we switched to bits; it feels more tiresome to learn to play tennis left-handed when you can already play right-handed, than if you'd just learnt to play left-handed from the start -- since it's holding you back in doing things you already know how to do, like game-tactics, etc... For most people who are coming into Bitcoin as n00bs, it will be easier to start with bits than it would've been to start with bitcoins, and probably easier for us too once we get used to it (I am getting more used to it already through practise -- I always use bits where I can -- unfortunately most price-tickers and exhange platforms are still using bitcoins..).

I think the best democracy is where people get poker chips for doing other people favours, and then they can take those poker chips and use them to vote for other people to do favours for them, but the people can choose whether or not to accept them. In this kind of democracy, fraud/theft/extortion/coercion excluded, the people who do the most &amp; biggest favours for other people and are also wise enough to encourage people to vote plentifully for them in the process get the most votes, but people can still choose whether or not to accept their votes. So, if people don't like this kind of democracy, they can just choose not to take part and they won't be affected, they can keep their little hobbit hole in the ground and their plot of land, and live peacefully, only being as affected by others' votes as they choose to be.

Sure, I expect most people do. But what happens when you find out the police won't do shit even though you have all the necessary information to track the guy and prove his guilt, and when you try to put out a bounty for assistance, people are insulting you for being an idiot for getting scammed (and no one else would fall for this), saying you deserved it (and therefore by implicit extension that if you did it to someone else they would deserve it too), getting 200 upvotes, everything you say to defend yourself gets 200 downvotes.(Oh yeah, and threatening to report you to the police for wanting to go and get your money back from the guy yourself.)
I don't know if you had this experience, and if you did what your feelings would be, but this is what many people experience when they get scammed, and I know for a fact that some of these people go on to scam other people after experiencing this, or at least consider it for a while before moving on. Also many of these people lose considerably more than $185. I know people who get scammed out of several thousands of dollars.
I am aware of people whom this happened to, and when they then went on to scam other people, they'd start out by explaining to the mark (for example someone posting on a forum that they wanted to trade BTC using PayPal -- or whatever way they got scammed themselves) the risk of getting scammed by transacting in this way, and recommend safer avenues, and then if the mark ignores this advice and chooses to transact with them anyway, then they scam the mark, and they say to themselves that if he was not doing it someone else would, and better the money goes to him. Sometimes the nouveau scammer will return some of the money and charge the remainder for the lesson taught to the mark, which he says will save the mark money in the future.

Hierarchical Deterministic: deterministic meaning all the addresses are generated from one seed (master private key); hierarchical meaning, I think, that each address's private key can be used to generate all the addresses below it on its own branch, but not those above it nor on adjacent branches.

If the miners will give them &gt;50% in the first place, what makes you think they will change when ghash does more bad things (in addition to known double spending in the past). The miners are just trying to get as much short-term profit from their ASICs as they can before they go obsolete, in classic tragedy of the commons style (the assumption in the past was that people would protect their mining investment, but since the investment depreciates anyway, this doesn't hold -- though perhaps in the future we will hit a wall in mining-advances and this will work). Many people mining with ghash probably don't even look at reddit, don't know about the problems with single centralised pools having large network share etc..
Adoption of Bitcoin by masses of people who don't understand it has come before the protocol has been refined to a sufficient degree to cope with that. If we were all still people who understood and really valued the Bitcoin network, then we would act as you say -- in the long-term interest of Bitcoin, whilst the protocol is improved in the meantime -- but many people are just trying to get 'free money' (as they irrationally conclude), following the most obvious short-term profit motives.
When a few people are living in a commune, they are all passionate about communism and understand what they must do to make it work; if they find they don't like it they just leave and are replaced by people who are still passionate about it. When communism (or pre-communist state-socialism as described in the communist manifesto, whatever..) is imposed, gradually more and more people fall in line with short-term profit motives and the system collapses. Currently, the short-term profit-motives in Bitcoin are almost as broken as those in communism, and this needs to be fixed before Bitcoin can handle mass-adoption.

I have a theory that bubbles are triggered by large sentiment traders, who wait until the market sentiment is low and thus people are giving their BTC away 'cheaply', because the general sentiment is that it's not going back up, then they keep buying through the low sentiment, and then at some point they cause it to start going up again, at this point swing traders buy in, followed by less and less savvy traders/intestors until at the end it's the people who know nothing about trading buying in until we reach euphoria (the sentiment is that it will keep going up indefinitely), at which point the large sentiment traders sell (because people will keep buying BTC 'expensively' because they think it will go higher) eventually causing the price to go down; swing traders who didn't already sell on the way up sell now, and then once again we get the cascade of less and less experienced traders selling into the bottom until we hit depression again, where the sentiment is that it will keep going down.
All the while, fundamentals investors, ideologists etc are just sitting here hodling, likely working on their Bitcoin businesses, coding core and infrastructure, or just generally getting on with being productive in their lives.

I think this new voting points system is really bad for that...
Before I would be happy, if I made a controversial comment, if it would be scored 10|-11 for example: I would know that some people liked it, and a decent number of people had seen it. Now I would just see -1, and assume that only two people saw it and both disliked it, so it decreases the motivation to bother constructing controversial comments in the first place. It takes significant effort to actually make a good comment, and if no one sees it or appreciates it, I'm better off spending that time doing something else.

Please inform your brother that someone could easily stick a QR code to a different Bitcoin address over his own one, and people could end up sending btc to an imposter, if he uses that as a way to receive payment. It happened before to a hotel/restaurant or something.. I think it's better if the QR code links to his web address than his Bitcoin address (and his Bitcoin address can be accessed through his website), and if he wants to use a physical QR code for payment he can keep it on the inside of his van where it can't be (so easily) tampered with.

Many early adopters want to support Bitcoin, and don't want to use fiat money, so they will not sell on an exchange, even though they have more BTC than they feel they need (want) and so would like to get some things with it. When merchants adopt Bitcoin, this gives those early adopters a chance to cash out some of their excess coins, without going through the fiat they despise, and whilst also supporting Bitcoin to some degree by encouraging merchant adoption and generating publicity. Have you not seen the calls on reddit and elsewhere for Bitcoiners to support merchants who adopt Bitcoin? Many of these people go to merchants like Overstock, and just look for anything they could use and buy it (to support the merchant), and maybe they even would repurchase Bitcoin except they don't actually have any fiat money that they can afford to put into it.

When there is something that is better than Bitcoin, but is not compatible, i.e. Bitcoin software cannot just be updated to be like the new technology. So, it will not be replaced by another cryptocurrency like the altcoins being written now which are just variations on Bitcoin, but could be replaced by something entirely different that we can't even conceive of now. The thing which replaces Bitcoin will be as different to Bitcoin as Bitcoin is to pre-Bitcoin money; and that means it will be a black-swan event, something unpredictable, created by a polymath with knowledge of many fields working alone, with an idea that came to him whilst he was sitting on a park bench (Newton), or on a trampoline (Einstein), etc...

Thanks. 
I thought the *idea* was that as more businesses accepted Bitcoin, this would increase its utility and then the demand for Bitcoin would increase. I thought that at some point, a business might have enough of their own suppliers taking Bitcoin that they might re-buy Bitcoin for their own purchases in responses to discounts based on transaction fees etc.. Then, I thought that at some point businesses might just start holding Bitcoin. My reasoning could be flawed though, it happens often enough.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I use voluntary interaction to mean 'interaction absent coercion'. So, if there is any coercion (the threat of other humans initiating violence if I don't do something) then I do not consider it to be a voluntary interaction.
I do not consider that my non-compliance with, nor overpowering of a robber make his extortive threats any less coercive.
I consider that I am in control of my own thoughts and actions, and thusly that if I am made a slave, and told that if I do not cut 100 sheaths of corn in a day that I will be hanged, that if I proceed to cut 100+ sheaths of corn per day I am doing so by my own choice, because I want to, but not that I am doing so voluntarily.

Your problem is that you are operating on incorrect information. The official exchange rate is just a number plucked out of some politician's ass, it means nothing on the market. The exchange rate is whatever rate at which you can actually exchange one thing for another. So, you are over-valuing your VEF based on what the government is telling you. Of course the State wants you to think their currency is worth more than it is. Just suck it up and buy the BTC at the real exchange rate.
Of course that doesn't mean you shouldn't shop around to get the best deal, and as other commenters have suggested you may find you can get a better deal by trading through USD on the way to BTC.

Why does it need to keep up with the blockchain? You only need a thin client like Electrum. If you were keeping up with the blockchain, that'd mean it'd be connected to the internet anyway, which you shouldn't do for large amounts of Bitcoin: you want cold-storage for that. Also, I don't know what kind of laptop wouldn't be supported by major Linux distros, is there such a thing? I think you'd have to try really hard to find one.
For the bios malware, you can collect in person to prevent interception and take your chances that it didn't get there before. Flashing the BIOS isn't *necessarily* good enough for all bios malware (see 'BadBIOS', not even known to be real or not -- if it is real, it's most likely something that the Govt with put there on an intercept, I think, not something some random person will have on their old laptop by any chance worth considering) but for most it is; you can get new BIOS chips for like $8 if you're paranoid about BadBIOS, but I don't know how easy it is to find one for any specific model because I've never done it.

It's like a cartel. It would be best for the States if they all banned Bitcoin, but any State to let Bitcoin alone will benefit hugely. So, it's most likely that the greatest powers will try to kill Bitcoin, whilst some lesser powers will take the opportunity to get a boost against their rivals. They will take the decreased control over its citizens against the huge gain to taxable prosperity which they receive by being one of the first few States to allow free Bitcoin trade. Remember, even if they cannot tax Bitcoin itself, they can tax the prosperity which grows around it. Any State with free Bitocoin trade would experience mass influx of the currency and so of business evolving around it.
Then, as the number of States deregulating Bitcoin increases, the losses from regulating Bitcoin increase vs the benefits of regulating it, and the remaining regulating States will be under more and more incentive to deregulate.

1 - If money is becoming worth more then there is also more incentive to go and work and earn some of that money, and to under-bid with your labour to get some of it now before it goes up more in value. If people are unemployed they will under-bid until they convince someone to pay them. The only thing stopping that is minimum wage, but Bitcoin could be easier to pay people with under minimum wage. I know people who have picked up second jobs or taken up more hours to earn more Bitcoin *now* whilst they think it will go up in value.
2 - Bitcoin billionaires still can't counterfeit Bitcoin, so the only way they can get further bitcoins is to steal them directly (which is difficult) or to work for them. Also many of the people with lots of Bitcoin are voluntaryists so it's cool.

Anarchism is based on: 
The difference is what people think should be property rights(exclusive, inclusive, communal, etc..). So there can be polycentric anarchism, where all anarchists support the NAP but have different protocols for determining property rights within their areas/territories.
There can be non-anarchistic polycentrism, which is basically just tribes, which we came from already, and there's no reason we wouldn't just end up again where we are now.
What distinguishes anarchism is the NAP, and it's what means people can keep living in their tribes, or their different cities with different rules, etc.. Because no one who is following the N.A.P can invade them, and anyone who supports the NAP strongly will defend victims of invasion.

Tell me, why do people go and earn money in the first place, and how do they do it? You're looking at one side without looking at the other. If money is going to increase in value, people are more incentivised to earn it in the first place, and how do they earn it? By providing value to others i.e. by working. Why do they want money which will increase in value? Because they hope to use that money at some point to exchange it for things which they value, such as crops, computers and ore.

I'm not telling him what he should be doing with his life, I'm just telling him the truth, that there are always options: I am offering him empowerment through knowledge of freedom and personal responsibility. Things only have as much value as we place on them, that includes bitcoins and houses both, neither is necessarily more valuable to an individual than the other, so to maximise personal value, he should weigh up the importance of the various things in his life and make the decision based on his thoughts there, rather than doing things because he feels he ‘has to’: because he doesn’t, no one *has* to do anything in and of itself, people only have to do things in order to achieve other things, and the value of any of those achievements is subjective.
Personally, I can see Bitcoin going all the way down to $12, but yet I have the majority of my BTC as a hodl stash that I will not touch until Bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency, and a fractional portion beyond that which I just use as savings for whatever I want.
Maybe selling 60,000,000 bits would be enough to save his house, then he could keep 10,000,000 bits as a hodl like mine, that he will never touch regardless until Bitcoin is the world reserve, and 5,000,000 bits which he can use for what he wants (exchange trading, goods trading, investing, saving, etc..). If Bitcoin goes where it has the potential to go, then even 1 BTC would be of tremendous value, say 10 years into the future.
The world is a sandbox environment where only the laws of physics are set in stone, all rules and values beyond that are made by people, and are up to us to accept or reject, and we can make our own games with our own rules if we have the imagination and the will.

The idea is that many of the earlier adopters will still value bitcoins, and will be cashing out 1) as a hedge against the value of bitcoins collapsing; and 2) to pay merchants who don't accept bitcoins; and therefore will still hold and desire to receive bitcoins themselves. I value Bitcoin for its intrinsic properties. If say I had invested $1000 and it was now worth $100,000, it's likely that I would have sold around $8000 worth for example whilst holding the rest and continuing to accept payment in bitcoins. Of course people will also be spending fiat/bitcoin on things including other investments.

Fiat is Latin for 'by decree'; fiat currency is currency by decree; in other words: it's currency that people use (as opposed to other currencies) because if they don't they will (ultimately, if they maintain resistance against escalating use of violence) get shot. For example, you need USD to pay taxes, and alternative currencies get shut down, like eGold and the Liberty Dollar; Bitcoin hasn't been shut down because it can't be.
The more people who take Bitcoin as payment, the less reasons I have to hold fiat currency, like the USD, which I consider a good thing.

Hire Detroit Threat Management Centre for protection and get bars on the doors and windows. Then, advertise what you're going to be starting (how you can benefit the locals) and invite locals to free educational seminars, parties, etc to get them on your side so they will not attack the place and maybe will even defend it. As you make friends with the locals, gradually do the things i8e says, so the locals will feel like they are part of it, part of making it happen, even invite them to help you set it up -- you could pay them in BTC to do so; this way they will be more on your side.

Supply/demand. The more people are selling their bitcoins, the more supply there is, the more people will demand for their resources because they are less confident that their bitcoins will be demanded by others; so the less amount of value can be moved through bitcoins because of the lower market-cap, and the more volatility there is, and the less useful it is as a currency.
The more people are selling their bitcoins, the less bitcoins are worth, the less resources they can get in exchange for them, the less useful Bitcoin is..

The best definition of inflation is: A decrease in the value of a currency. Most people say inflation is either: 1) An increase in the supply of money; or 2) An increase in the price of goods purchased with money. I think my definition is better, or perhaps the following would be even better: A decrease in the value of a currency resulting from an increased supply.
Most people call deflation either 1) A decrease in the price or goods; or 2) A decrease in the supply of money. I think a better definition for deflation is: An increase in the value of a currency.
So, an increase in BTC price would be deflation, not inflation.

If A (Stooge) sends PayPal tokens to B (Scammer) in exchange for Bitcoin, and A doesn't receive the bitcoins, PayPal will not refund the PayPal tokens to A because bitcoins are a digital good (and therefore are not covered).
If B (Scammer) sends PayPal tokens to A (Stooge) in exchange for bitcoins, B will make sure that nowhere is it stated that the exchange is for a digital good, and after A sends his bitcoins to B, A will then claim the order was for a physical good which he did not receive (providing fake evidence as required, if required), and PayPal will refund the tokens to B.
If A (Stooge) is well versed in scamming (which takes time to learn, and therefore is a waste of his time unless he is a scammer himself or leverages the knowledge in some other profitable way), and B (Scammer) tries to scam him, then A will not be scammed, but he will waste his time, and B will not be scammed either, and nor will there be any evidence with which to prove that B was attempting to scam A.
Any way it works out, the Stooge loses. Just don't trade PayPal for bitcoins, whichever side you're on...

One man may be happier working for £3/hr in a job he loves, than to work for £7/hr in a job he hates (he may even be able to derive his sustainance from the former job thus rendering him more financially wealthy from it too, e.g. if he is a farmer who lives on-site and eats from the excess produce); yet the economics of the legacy system says that the second is more profitable, worshipping GDP as the be-all and end-all of productivity and in fact bans him from working in the former job through minimum-wage laws to save him from exploitation.
If you still don't understand, consider why you want money in the first place... You want money, ultimately, so that it can be spent on something you want -- it's a store of value. So, some people like going on fishing holidays thus they spend their money on that.. But what if they could make their living by fishing? When they make money and spend it on fishing it boosts GDP, but when they make money by fishing, their fishing experience is not recorded as a boost to GDP, only the financial profits derived thereof. Yet in reality, the latter is more profitable as they get to fish all the time, live on their boat, live off of the fish they catch, and anything they make by selling the fish is pure financial profit.

 Hi.
The difference is this:
In politics, the super-rich use their money to influence politicians into forcing others to give up their resources to be used in ways that serve the super-rich person's interests.
In the market, the super-rich use their money to influence market-actors (e.g. businesses) into using the resources which the super-rich person provides him in ways which benefit the super-rish person's interests.
...and in the market, the super-rich person only got all those resources in the first place because people thought that he could provide them something more valuable and so gave them up voluntarily.
...of course, the market we have today is influenced by politics, so whilst the above paragraph is still true, it is often the case that consumers are herded towards that particular rich person by regulations, because competition with him has been forcefully restricted.

Best approach I think is to set a hodl amount you're happy with, get to that, lock that in, and let anything you buy beyond that be savings that you can hold, spend, trade, donate, etc as you want, but you never touch the hodl under any circumstances, unless Bitcoin becomes the main world currency. So therefore the HODL must be money you can afford to let go to nothing, etc.. and you satisfy your trading needs with the rest.

Ideas are data, which may be held in our brains, on paper, or in computers. We can run through the idea of a movie in our heads so it plays to us, we may record it in a book, or we may record it on a computer such that it will play back to us. When the idea is formatted in the computer such that it will play to the viewer, I can copy this idea, this data, and put the idea/data on my own computer. I can then once again take the idea and record it in my mind or on paper, I may record it on paper such that it flows in a pleasant way, then someone else may copy that and transfer it to their own mind and maybe transfer the idea into a computer again such that it is interactive.

"Most organizations suffer from an inner contradiction or internal inconsistency. Generally, "when we create a structure to achieve a public mission, more time is spent on the structure than on the mission." Although Sam Steiger, the Arizona politician familiar to some libertarians, made this observation, others have noted this same tendency. For example, historian Carroll Quigley in his book, The Evolution of Civilizations, describes the practice of "every social organization to become a vested-interest institution more concerned with its efforts to maintain itself or advance its own interests than to achieve the purpose that society expects it to achieve." (p. 34) As evidence, he mentions fraternities (originally intended to promote student fellowship, but often dividing students into competitive cliques), and the institutionalization of football (originally intended to provide exercise for undergraduates, but which is now one of the great spectator sports). In each case the organization begins with a devotion to a purpose and somehow along the way turns away from that purpose and gradually becomes a collection of special interests. Surely libertarians are not immune from this tendency!"

Could you give some examples of claims you think are irrational?
I think deciding whether people are being rational or irrational is complicated because it depends on how deep you're looking. On the surface something may appear irrational, but then on a deeper level it can be rational and vice versa. For example, a person who tries to use pure philosophical debate style logic in regular social situations may appear logical on one level, but on a deeper level he is illogical because this style is ineffectual with regular people who are not philosophers. Another example is that someone being ignorant about politics and therefore holding ignorant views may seem irrational, but on the other hand, perhaps the time it would've taken him to have had a good understanding would have cost him a lot of income and enjoyment.

Looking at the evidence cited from 
Voluntary is defined as anything: "Done, given, or acting of one’s own free will"
I will emphasize the 'free' aspect here, as I would say that if I comply with a robber to hand over my possessions that I am acting of my own will (as you say, there are alternative options such as non-compliance and over-powering), but not of my own free will, as I would say my will is influenced by the coercive threats of the robber and therefore not freely enacted.
I consider that 'free', here, is in the context of human-human interactions in the present, not of physical forces such as gravity and past influences such as parenting.

Pitch your idea to investors so they will loan you money, for interest or not.
Edit: the following distinction is apparently more esoteric than I realised (though the above still applies, one doesn't need a credit card, where new money is created, to get a loan; one can get a loan from other people who have earned the money if one does not want to first earn the money himself):
For anyone not familiar with the subject, credit is different to loans: credit is monetary inflation (counterfeiting/hidden theft in the case of a currency which people are forced to use involuntarily) for assignment of new monetary units and a loan is a transfer of existing monetary units.

Stopping someone jump off a bridge is not a violation of NAP if you are taking the significant chance that they are not of sound mind at the time, so not capable of exercising property rights over their body, since we only grant property rights to objects capable of moral reasoning (based on practicality). If you find out they are of sound mind (and are therefore in ownership of their person) and you keep stopping them then it is a violation of the NAP.
So I can grab a person and hold them down and talk to them, but if then he explains to me rationally why he wants to jump then it would be a violation of the NAP to keep stopping him.
Sometimes people go to jump hoping someone will stop them, so it is implicit consent to be stopped; sometimes people are having a side-effect from a drug or a mental disturbance from an illness. It's the same as you can push someone out of the way of a falling rock assuming they don't know it's coming and would thank you afterwards, it's implicit consent again.

I'm only part way through so I don't know if he mentions it but blockchain currencies can be programmed to release coins based on data gathered from the internet, so for example it can monitor for enough news sources saying that a person had died and then transfer the property based on that. It can also collect the information about when the person died to decide which predictor(s) to transfer the property to.
Instead of guessing a date, the guess could include strange circumstances or evidence found at the crime scene, which would likely also be mentioned in the news.
So that whole idea could be done without any central organisation; entirely decentralised in the blockchain... Based on the programming of the contract, which is planned for future updates to cryptocurrencies.

Operating out of Silicon Valley, **the idealistic vision of the company was one of a borderless currency, free from governmental controls.** When venture capital funding combined with eBay transaction partnerships, PayPal quickly shot up to 1 million users after just 15 months [source: PayPal].
**However, PayPal's success quickly drew the attention of hackers, scam artists and organized crime groups, who used the service for frauds and money laundering."**
Haha, the latter emboldened text I found by accident whilst I was looking for the former; it's funny in light of Peter Thiel's comment shared by the top-commenter in this thread.

"The truth of the matter is that when faced with ideas that challenge their view of the world, logic rarely works on anybody."
There is a bell-curve of logicality for men and women, women's is just shifted somewhat closer to the origin on the x axis than men's. This is not sexist, it's just a perceived fact; whilst it disadvantages women in the area of logic, it actually gives them advantages in the area of emotion; they are a bit worse in one area and better in another: neither man nor woman is better overall. The reason why they are less good at logic is because they trade it off for heightened emotional receptivity, which is theorised to originate largely for the purpose of interpreting and catering to the needs of babies; but it can also be used with adults for social manipulation, which historically women have relied upon for sustenance (they had to convince men to protect and provide for them in order to survive, whereas men could support themselves).
Women are also more reliant on 'the tribe', so are less likely to shake the boat in general; if they perceive their tribe (be it the USA or her family/father/husband: whoever *feels* stronger to her) is generally against Bitcoin, they're likely to play it safe and go with that. Men having ~20x more testosterone than women is hugely significant in their predisposition to risk-taking and conflict-making.

In a digression from topic, you linked me to a book called 'Guns, Germs and Steel'. I read the Wikipedia, and the argument in the book is that the reason that African Negroids have not invented anything is not because they're less intelligent than Caucasoids and Mongoloids, but because they didn't have domesticatable animals and high-protein crops; he specifically references the Zebra as being undomesticatable, which is why I linked a video of a tamed zebra being ridden like a horse. I am saying that I think Jared Diamond's argument there is nonsense, as it is only through selective breeding that we came to have these crops and domestic animals. Wild horses were tamed, like zebras can be, and were only made highly domesticated beyond that through selective breeding and training from birth.
I shared my thoughts on it with you as I thought you might be interested, if you're not I don't care.

NSA has been working for a long time to weaken encryption standards. I don't know how all the ways they've been doing it (apparently they infiltrated some of the organisations which develop the encryption) and how successful they've been though. Also, the govt has forced encrypted services to shut down  because they wouldn't give backdoors (like that email one Edward Snowden was using, forgot the name..), so it's a fair chance that some of the encrypted services which haven't been shut down gave in.

I hope you thanked the individual, it seems like he was only trying to help you out, even if he was misinformed.
It's of course possible he is a paid shill, but I choose to give people the benefit of the doubt to the degree that it does not cost me. (so even if I suspect he might be a shill, I will treat him as though he is just trying to help me whilst maintaining my suspicion.)
One thing which is of great importance when dealing with people, in order to not get scammed, is to never feel like the other person is more important than you. Scammers will try to make you feel they are more important, so you will become more pliable for them (e.g. in social engineering an employee of a company, they will act annoyed that they, as a chairman of the board are being questioned like a nobody -- and then the employee will become submissive and apologise, letting the social engineer through without the security protocols). If you always maintain your self-worth in interactions, never feel (it's feeling, not thinking) that the other person is more valuable than you, that their time is any more important than yours, etc, then you will be much more resistant to scamming, as I observe this power-playing (shifting the subconscious/emotional power balance towards the scammer, making the target off-balance and weak/vulnerable to manipulation) to be the foundation of all social engineering.

Inflation of USD is ~6%, not 3%. Expansion of the monetary base, i.e. real inflation, is ~6% a year, same in the UK. 3% is the toyed with figure they get by choosing either goods or companies which have increased in value, subtracting their gains in efficiency from the decreased value of currency and making it look as though inflation is only half what it is.
Edit for additional info: In the UK for example they have the CPI (Consumer Price Index), where they choose a few goods that people regularly buy, select the ones which have gone down the most in price, and for which buying habits have decreased, and measure inflation by the average price change of these products. So, they just choose whatever combination of products gives them the figures they want. An example of how silly it is, is that let's say they used to measure eggs by the price-per dozen but now people usually buy them in the half dozen, they will take now the price of a half-dozen eggs, along with gains in efficiency, and say there was 50% deflation (but then they balance it with the goods which increased in price to get the 2-3% inflation they want). The public aren't actually even allowed to see what specific data is being used to calculate the CPI.

Libertarians want the maximum individual freedom from initiatory violence. Different libertarians disagree on the best way to maximise freedom from initiatory violence however. If you are willing to cognizantly compromise freedom from initiatory violence then you are not a libertarian.
So you may think that without a minimal govt (courts, police, military) we would suffer more coercion from warlords in which case you can be a minarchist libertarian, even if your understanding of what would happen without a govt is mistaken. But there is no way you could rationally think that govt healthcare would increase freedom from coercion.

Men and women *are* different. 
Marketing targets males as well as women, and 'takes advantage of' both.
Why is it important to get women to do something they're not good at? Women are not as logical as men, nor are they as intelligent, but they are more emotional. Better to allow them to do the fields they're naturally drawn to rather than trying to fit square pegs into round holes. Should we be trying to encourage midgets to aspire for the NBA also? I think that's either misguided or cruel, depending on your level of awareness: getting people's hopes up, making them aspire to an area where they're naturally disadvantaged.. Whilst there are areas where midgets can perform as well or even better than non-midgets; and likewise for women.
The kind of women who are going to be better at coding, are not the kind of women who are going to be affected by marketing specifically targeted towards females, unless it's specifically targeted towards 'tomboys'/(relatively) masculine or aspergic females.
Sexism means hatred of someone because of their sex, not acknowledging (even incorrectly) differences between the sexes. Acknowledging the differences between midgets and non-midgets is not hatred, nor is acknowledging the differences between men and women.

Good question Sky, my thoughts on the matter are as follows, make use of them as you will:
I conceive that companies accepting Bitcoin may offer discounts due to savings on banking fees, and to promote the currency if they're accepting it for that reason. Also, Bitcoin can do some things that fiat can't do, like quick micro-transactions used for purchasing data and bandwith etc.. See the Toroken project for example.
I propose that even if fiat has greater utility than Bitcoin, increasing utility for Bitcoin will still increase demand for Bitcoin nevertheless (possibly leading to a positive feedback loop). Then there are other benefits of Bitcoin like the inability for governments to print more of it, which will have a greater value in countries with more inflation than the US (which itself has inflation at around 5% -  Then there is the anti-seizure properties of Bitcoin which make it a useful alternative to off-shore accounts, and as a convenient way to take money out of countries which limit withdrawal of capital to foreign countries (which includes the US). Furthermore, cash is not the only means of acquiring Bitcoin. There are projects in the works which allow one to earn Bitcoin by renting out various properties of their home computers and networks; and there is already the possibility of accepting Bitcoin as payment for other goods and services.
Good day to you.

I think that if you are struggling to afford good food, you should not be buying anything that is not essential, like toys and costumes, or any other gifts/things that you would not buy if it was not christmas. The most enjoyable thing for children is playing with friends and family, he can be creative and having fun playing with anything. Children aren't wise, they don't know what they want consciously, but you can observe from their (subconscious) actions/reactions: they are happy when they are healthy and when they are playing with friends and family; they say they want toys and things, but these don't tend to really make them happy once they get them, I think it's often filling a void left by a lack of the important things; the more lonely and the more sick a child is the more things he will want. I think you said 16 months or something..

The use of credit in finance comes from accounting; in the language of an ancient person using 'double entry accounting', debit meant left and credit meant right, and it was the custom to enter things on the left, debit side those things which were deducted and enter things on the right, credit side those things which were added. So the meaning of the word has gone from meaning 'right' to meaning 'something added in one place which was deducted from another place', so this includes loans of existing monetary units.
However there's another newer meaning, the one I made reference to in my previous comment, but as a result of searching, I've actually found that it's a lot more esoteric than I had assumed. It's used widely by anarchists, autrian economists, chicago economists, libertarians, green-backers, constitutionalists, communists, and other counter-cultural groups I interact with regularly, but is apparently not a distinction made in mainstream usage.
Edit: There are apparently several different distinctions made between 'credit' and 'loan' by a range of different organisations. For example some banks make this distinction:

That is challenges such as new types of dancing (e.g. twerking) and situations where character conservation is important (e.g. texting/tweeting).
People whose native language is less popular globally also tend to invest in more popular languages like English as an alt-language, whereas people invested in English from the start tend not to invest much in alt-languages. If there was not govt enforcement they would probably use English as their main language from the start, I expect.

Yes, I'm aware that if people only hoarded and did not spend BTC then that would be bad. Though, the answer is not that they should spend BTC for the sake of spending, but that they should use BTC to do what they would otherwise use fiat for where possible (and then just buy back into BTC -- if they are still even getting paid in fiat, which they should also try to change if possible). So the answer isn't that people should spend more. They should spend the same, but use BTC where possible.

I don't know of any good resource, but I have the idea that in the future there will be a global public reputation database with distributed trust, that will keep record of crimes people commit, along with the restitution owed in relation to that crime, which is reduced as it's paid back to the victim.
Before doing any significant business, people would expect that their partners be registered with the database, and adding additional info like DNA would increase confidence (much like localbitcoins etc.. currently).
Restraint (imprisonment, curfew, bans, etc..) is costly, not only to enforce, but in the resulting lost productive capacity of the subject, which could’ve been tapped by the victim. Individuals would of course still be free to ban criminals from interacting with themselves or their property. I think restraint should only be used for protection, not punishment, and when restraint is used, that it should be done in a way which maximises the subject’s ability to still provide restitution whilst he is being restrained, so that once/if he is deemed no longer a threat, he can be released with a restored reputation and having also made the victim whole; even having paid for his own restraint and further built up savings on top of that, to give him something worth being released for, and to get him started when he is out.
I think that if a person is definitely dangerous, almost certainly won’t recover from their dangerous ways, and refuses to work in order to pay for his own restraint, that it would be O.K. to execute him if there was no one who voluntarily wanted to pay to restrain him.

I don't value intellectual property rights, but I value intellectual property.
Properties are attributes of resources. For example a field has the property of being plowable. One therefore might have a right to plow his field (or any other bundle of rights in regards to his field), and others might have a right to cross his field: more properly he might not have the right to prevent others from crossing his field.
Rights I have already defined.
So, I value physical and intellectual properties: the attributes of physical and intellectual resources (e.g. The drivability of cars and the enjoyability of ‘The Hobbit’). I also value it when people come together to agree upon certain protocols for the use of force in regards to physical resources, e.g. the protocol that people should be allowed to do what they want with their body to the extent that it doesn't infringe on others doing what they want with their own bodies or other physical properties. 
I don't however value it when people come together and agree on a protocol that when someone has an idea and applies it upon physical resources, that force should be used in order to prevent others from copying that idea and applying it to and with their own physical resources to which they have physical property rights.

Hey man, what anarcho-capitalists advocate is not no-regulation, it's just no theft/murder/rape/extortion etc.. i.e. no initiation of violence. So, by anarcho-capitalist philosophy/ideology - they being the people who put down regulation-by-the-government - are not against using violence to protect people from scammers/thieves/rapists etc... They are only against initiating violence. So... Anarcho-capitalists are fine with groups of people with guns going and catching thieves and forcing them to repay money they have stolen, they just aren't O.K. with those same people with the guns acquiring their funding through extortion (currently taxation) and using coercion to for example tell a cab driver he must not charge less than a $20 fare or he will get fined (and if he doesn't pay the fine go to jail).
Minarchist (minimal government) libertarians are similar to anarcho-capitalists, and are the other people who put down regulation. However, they think it is O.k. for the government to use initiatory violence for the collection of taxes only and nothing else. So, these guys are also fine with defensive regulation, i.e. sending men with guns to go after thieves/scammers/defrauders etc...
I'm not saying these positions are/aren't good/bad, just giving the facts for your own consideration, and I hope it has been helpful for you.

I think you don't understand what a 'resource based economy' means, assuming you're talking about the Venus Project. A resource based economy doesn't use money, it uses a central computer which knows all of the resources on the Earth and allocates them to people using some algorithm which has apparently already been invented but for some reason the inventors can't share with anyone.
Perhaps I'm wrong though, I'm not an expert on it, just sharing my thoughts -- I'm just as happy if I am the one who is corrected as if you are.
Edit: Somehow I think I misread your comment sorry, since you said that 'Bitcoin is the end of money'.. My question instead then is, why do you think Bitcoin will be the end of money, when it aims to be money itself? Also, how are you confident that the RBE algorithm really works, when you have not seen it in action, even in an isolated setting? Money solves the 'coincidence of wants' problem as well as being part of the solution to the 'economic calculation problem'.

I think the parties in a marriage should just be allowed draw up a contract in advance and have it fairly administered as appropriate. I don't think it should be different from any other contract. I think if the parties do not make any contract then there should be no enforcement. In such a case women and men should be taught by their parents/elders to be careful in choosing partners and to make sure to create sensible contracts.
I think that if a man and a woman create a child then they each have a duty to care for that child, as through their actions they have put someone (the child) in a position wherein he is dependent on them for his survival (just as one would be responsible for a man's wellbeing after having pushed him into a lake).

Dude... TSA; border guards and the 'arresting officer' are all government employees, hence not subject to market forces. Of course, if you create a monopoly on violence and fund someone through extortion then they are not subject to market pressures.
If a private shop experiences theft then demand increases for security guards, and once demand for security meets security workers' demand for payment, then the shop will employ the security guard. If there is more demand more people become security guards due to increased opportunity (and wages until supply meets demand) in the sector; if there is more demand for handsome polite security guards those will be more expensive.
It doesn't matter if people want the TSA or not, because the government pays for them with extortion, debt and counterfeiting. The TSA doesn't have to persuade you to employ them by providing a valuable service.

Large Bitcoin whales who want to cash out wait until there is good news, so they won't move the market too much, as their downward sell-pressure is at first absorbed by the increased demand from the good news. However, since it's not just one whale, they all scramble to get as much sold as they can before the price starts to move down (market-failure effect), and so the price always takes a hit before the whales react and pull their sell-orders.

That sounds like it will bloat the blockchain, making it harder for people to run full nodes -- something which is essential for Bitcoin security. Alternatively you can achieve a similar thing through some merge-mining set-up, so you get the data tied in with the timestamp from the blockchain, but the actual data is written somewhere else. I don't understand it well so you'll have to ask someone else for directions. Just giving you a heads up so you can look into it more yourself.

Almost everyone in the USA is using auto-vehicles to get around, so the need for horse-drawn-carriage makers is gone. How is that any different to that there would be no need for a State if people became voluntaryists?
Why can a group of aggressors destroy a larger group of voluntaryist people? Non-aggressive (non violence initiating) people can produce much more efficiently and develop better technology for defending themselves than people who are being hampered by aggression. It's why the English State first, and now the USA, have been able to dominate the world with empires, because they have had more liberty than other countries with which to produce wealth -- which the State takes and uses for war. 
When the USSR collapsed and the govt no longer provided food through extortion, people didn't just die, they started paying farmers for their produce -- and so without the State stealing their money and providing defense, people would pay people to provide defense voluntarily, because it's something people value, like food..

I'm against the initiation of violence, the State just happens to be one agency which utilises the initiation of violence; as you've said there are many others, and I am against them too.
The State takes by force 55% of the average person's income through initiatory violence (extortion) in the USA/UK (Sales tax, income tax, taxes of the businesses you're buying from, property tax, etc, combined). It is better that the money is extorted in a stable fashion, which people are able to factor into their lives in advance, and through such overwhelming force that they will not even think of resisting (and therefore just accept -- reducing stress), as opposed to having a similar amount stolen in a haphazard manner by an assortment of other criminals. However, when the New World State taxed much lower, I don't think people lost nearly 55% of their income to theft (with taxes + other theft combined)...

=) Thanks for sharing the article. The price instability of Bitcoin is because lots of different people have lots of different ideas of how much Bitcoin is worth, and the market price is the point at which people's valuations intersect. Until Bitcoin reaches full-adoption (adoption by all the people who can benefit from using it), the price will always be unstable, because the only way that the price would be stable is if most people agreed that it is worth the same amount. These same things apply to Quark. The only time these currencies will be stable is if they have fully grown or died.

**My present opinion:**
Money laundering should not be a crime, theft should be a crime.
If it is my money, I should be allowed to do what I want with it (that does not violate others' rights to their own property), including laundering it, spending it on drugs or hookers, etc…
If it is not my money, then anything I do with it without consent of the owner that affects his ability to use it should be a crime. E.g. If I steal your car that should be a crime, and then if I smash in the headlights after I have stolen it that should also be a crime; whereas if I clean it after having stolen it, that should not be a crime, unless I am doing it with intent to resell it for example.
So, if Mark has stolen money that should be a crime, then if he is laundering it to prevent its owners getting it back that should be a further crime. If he hasn’t stolen the money he should be allowed to do what he wants with it.

If your father earned the money, motivated by the prospect of what he could do with the money afterwards (as most people are) such as give it to you, then whether or not you earned it, it was earned for you, on your behalf and so is rightfully yours, you may’ve even been integral to its being earned in the first place just by your mere existence.
By purchasing those stocks with high dividends, you are supporting a company with your resources which is providing value to people, that's why it can offer you dividends. They are selling the stock to allow themselves to produce more value with the money they get, so you are helping them to produce value by supporting their company with your investment. If you were not buying, the value of the company would go down and they would have less money with which to produce value for their customers, and if they are paying dividends that means they are providing more value to the customers than you’re giving up with your investment and therefore they’re, with your help, providing a net economic benefit.
If you managed your money poorly and invested it in failing companies then you would be wasting resources, being counterproductive and a drain on the economy; when you invest in successful companies you are providing a net benefit to the economy. It can’t be one way and not the other.
Why does it matter how much 'work' you do whilst you are being productive? You could do lots of work, running around digging holes and burying your money underground, providing treasure maps to drug-lord to find the money, and you would be having a harmful effect to society; whereas you can let your bots to the work and provide value. Is a man who delivers produce on foot deserving of more wealth than a lorry driver because the lorry driver is sitting on his arse all day whilst the footman works hard?

Thanks for your response Madame Robin, ((hopefully) correcting my earlier gender error and appropriate as we've been discussing BDSM). Edit: That's Mistress in BDSM, my error.
I think it's important to come up with a system of rules/protocols for human interaction which are as simple as possible, so that everyone can understand and follow them without needing to defer to experts (which creates the opportunity for manipulation by the experts). The non-aggression-principle, plus this usufructory system of property rights I have described, is to my current judgment the best human interactions protocol suite which I have been able to conceive of, and which allows other protocols including variations of democracy, communism, R.B.E, socialism, capitalism, etc to be built on top of it in a state of voluntaryism/anarchy.
Regarding the violence definition, I think I did include 'with *intent* to harm'.
Do you think boxing is violent?
Looking at 
Harm is defined as: "physical or mental damage", which is how I intended to use the word. So, even if the BDSM is voluntary and gives pleasure, if it involves causing physical damage then it is still harm by that definition, the definition I was using in my definition of violence.
I'm very tired so there's a fair chance I may have misspoken in this latest post of mine, so I hope you will forgive me for that, but not hesitate to comment on any errors in your response if you come upon instances of such =) Good night.

But there is no rivalry over the possession and use of an idea. If I take your physical book or your physical car then you no longer possess it, but if I take the idea and use it to make my own book or car based on that idea, then you still have possession of your book/car. Only one person can own X car, so we must come up with some rules to decide who should own it in order to prevent conflict; but an infinite number of people may possess and use Y idea simultaneously and therefore no rules are required.
The rule of creator of X has rights over X, in the case of rivalrous resources decreases conflict(prevents people from using violence in competition over X; whereas in the case of non-rivalrous goods it increases it (causes people to chase after other people and use violence against them in competition over Y), and since the purpose of property rights is to decrease conflict we should abandon intellectual property rights.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
    Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
    Finds and shall find me unafraid.

I am the master of my fate,

Life isn't fair. It's best for everyone if each individual does the best he can with what he's given.
As I view it, children are the after-life, they're where your genes and wisdom can live on. Some people put their most valuable possessions in their grave, I'd give them to my children. Our conscious minds are only a very small part of our being, most of what we are and do comes from our subconscious. It's possible to use our conscious to over-ride our social-conditioning and alter our personalities to be what we want them to be, but hardly anyone does this to any great degree. Much of what people think of as their own accomplishments, could easily be seen as the accomplishments of their socially conditioned programming, which they just passively absorbed from their environment, which their parents were responsible for just as they are for whatever financial inheritance they passed down. Health; wisdom; genes and finances are all things we inherit from our parents.
From this view, it's perfectly natural and fair that a child should inherit his father's wealth. What's unfortunate is when he inherits his father's wealth but not his wisdom, and ends up wasting the money. I don't see that as any different though than if the father had had a breakdown and wasted the money himself; I see reproduction as just another stage in life. Our bodies are made up of completely different cells every 7 years anyway, reproduction is just another part of that cycle; children are biologically programmed to absorb the cultural memes of their parents and environment, it’s like replacing an old smart-phone and porting the old data over by Bluetooth.

For people to have freedom, they need to be responsible for their own actions. If other people are responsible for someone's actions, then those other people must be able to use violence to control that person's actions or else it's not fair: that they can be responsible for something they don't control. By blaming the SR drug dealer, you deny your ex-gf's friend's self-ownership, and self-ownership, with the NAP, is at the core of libertarianism.
If the SR dealer committed fraud that's a different matter, i.e. he told the guy it would be safe when it wasn't, he sold a bad cut, he sold to someone who was obviously fucking retarded (and the dealer couldn't have reasonably not realised that) and couldn't know wtf he was buying, etc..

The legacy system is centrally controlled and manipulated in order to maximise GDP (only one of the ends towards which it is manipulated). For example the mainstream economists think that war  and catastrophe is good for the economy because it boosts GDP, and they will print money to fund war, social programs, minimum-wage law enforcement, public sector workers and whatever else they want to fund to boost GDP. Government spending counts under GDP so just printing money and spending it on whatever the fuck makes it look to maintream economists like the incumbent government is improving the economy. Bitcoin can't be printed and distributed by some central authority...

He is talking about the N.A.P: 
To be clear, you have misunderstood what he was saying. Whether you want to understand is up to you, it matters little to me. If you want to understand, read the wikipedia.
N.A.P means it's O.K. to use defensive but not aggressive force. This means it's O.K. to defend property rights, but not to attack property rights.
All anarchists, like Taki, support the NAP, but different anarchists (I'm not sure what sort Taki is) support different protocols for determining property rights. Whatever property protocol Taki prefers, he seems to be an Anarchist without adjectives, supporting polycentric anarchism, which means that many anarchists supporting the NAP could live in different zones with their own property-rights protocols.
Examples of different property rights protocols:
1) Anyone who discovers a piece of land gains the right to use force to exclude others from it at will.
2) Anyone who uses a certain attribute of a resource gains the right to use force to ensure he is allowed to continue using that attribute of that resource.

Imagine if you could abstain from food, but you wouldn't get ill? (Not lose energy gradually, not get weak, not die etc..) You would be high all the time, trying to think how you were going to get food, working hard to get it, and you would save a lot of time also that you're not eating/cooking etc. Now imagine you went for a while, and then realised that since you actually don't need to eat you might as well redirect all that energy for trying to find food into something else. Now imagine that something else was self-development and capital accumulation, or any other form of 'success' (part of it could be looking for a wife even, or just sleeping with more girls if that's what you want..). That's one point to it.
As with their interaction in markets, all human action is driven by emotion, whether positive e.g. desire for money or negative e.g. fear of missing out. One of our strongest most compelling positive emotions is the sex emotion, so if this can be harnessed it can be a strong motivational driver, and nofapping, to whatever extent one does it (never fapping, or just limitting one's fapping to some extent) can help with this.

Dollars is just a convenient way to measure market-value because it's what most people already think in terms of, and because it's money it's relatively stable. For example, if we were to use wheat, not only do most people not know how much wheat is worth, but also because it has much more potential for volatility because of its relatively low market cap and unpredictability based on drought etc..
If measuring the market-value of bitcoins in dollars means we prefer dollars, wouldn't that hold for anything we measured it against? Do you think people who value bitcoins highly should talk about the market-value of bitcoins in terms of our subjectively-predicted future-market-valuation of bitcoins which will vary from person-to-person? This would be useless for communicating what people are trying to communicate by stating the market-value of bitcoins in dollars.

He should get a computer he knows won't have physical keyloggers and has never been on the internet, do a fresh debian installation, then download electrum on a clean computer, move to flash drive, and install to new offline PC from flashdrive, then generate seed and write down with it covered, fold inward, put cloth around it so it can't be seen through, put in envelope, practise memorising the seed every day, keep the seed safe, soaked with lighter fuel with a lighter next to it so you can burn it quickly if you need to, then after you're sure you've memorised it, hide it somewhere extremely safe and difficult to get to where no one could track you going to, create a password for electrum that you write down in the same paper as the seed and memorise that too, really good password (read up on how to make good passwords), never use it anywhere else. When you wake up and before you go to bed every day for the rest of your life, rehearse the seed and password in your head, always check your computer for tampering before you re-enter it again, but really you should not need to access the computer again at all until in 20 years time, and then you'd be better just re-generating the seed on a new computer just in case, and you can use the same password again because you never enter it anywhere that isn't 100% guaranteed clean, you just use a watch-only wallet on your clean PC to find which addresses to send to..

Stocks and property aren't ways to make money just by having it. People only make money through stocks and property if they pick their investments wisely, and those things become more valuable. So, if someone is able to make money by investing their money, then they are doing something valuable by managing their money that way, which is evident from the increase in value. Likewise with your point regarding deflation, if Bitcoin becomes worth more money as they hold it, then evidently they were doing something valuable by holding onto it; their holding onto it is doing something, just as if they were to sell it and buy an alt-coin or shares in a company that would also be doing something.

If you were capable of doing that -- which would mean you would need to live long enough for there to be 20 million bitboins, so there would also have to not be more than 1 million lost bitcoins; and you would have to have enough value to offer in exchange for them -- then yes, you would increase the value.
Buying and holding bitcoins increases the value, because it decreases the supply. I said that "Hoarding BTC has no negative effect". I would call an increase in value a positive effect, which you would understand if you read the link.

People hoarding just increases the value of the currency which actually is used to buy things (circulating currency) because it decreases supply. The only reason hoarding could be a problem was if there was actually not enough currency to trade with, either because people just can't get their hands on it, or because it is so valuable that they can't use it to purchase low-value goods/services -- so they start to use other currencies. Since Bitcoin is infinitely divisible, this is not a problem... HOARD AWAY!
Hoarding gold decreases the utility of gold, because the circulating gold becomes so valuable that it can't be used to buy anything smaller than a car, say, which actually decreases its value as it no longer has value as a currency, though it still retains value from its many other beneficial properties. Even if only 1 Bitcoin was left in circulation after all the hoarding, it could just be divided further.

I think I may have made an error in thinking that you had abandoned your original argument.
So, continuing with the line of your original argument: You say an insult is not an act worthy of violence -- why not? Your original argument was that: "The right if someone to "use their own property" stops when in harms another. That includes acts of violence or theft." -- and therefore IP is part of the NAP.
So, please define: 'harm', for me, as I am under the impression that it is subjective, with the same action being able to harm one person and delight another. The other meaning is to cause 'physical injury', which depends on how you define physical, since the brain is physical..

Fiat currency: Enforced currency, e.g. by a government declaring one must use it to pay his taxes, or that one may not use any other currency;
Debt-based currency: Currency which is issued as credit, i.e. Person A goes to creditor B, promises that if he is credited sum X he will return it to B within some time-frame and with or without some additional interest on top.

It doesn't really, though; it just feels more comfortable emotionally (for some people). There is no logical reason to buy back the exact amount of fiat one put into Bitcoin.
The logical decision is to temper one's valuation of Bitcoin's potential against one's valuation of one's own capacity to make such a valuation, and invest based on the result.
I have a high valuation of Bitcoin's future potential, as well as a high valuation of my own capacity to make such a valuation, due to my advanced understanding of economics and other relevant subjects.

There are lots of people who are capable of stealing money but who do not because of their morality and not wanting to have to look over their shoulder for revenge/the law. Many of these people have an even greater 'killing instinct' than those who exercise it regularly because they have it on a leash most of the time and when they unleash it they do so with a sense of righteousness. Androklis has given them not only a moral and legal pass, but moral and financial reward for retrieving his bitcoins.

That's what people did.. Wheels were useful as soon as they were invented, and so people started using them and benefiting from them straight away. Some people's wheels probably broke and their wheat fell out onto the ground, and this motivated people to find a fix, so maybe they bolted on some iron on the outside, and wheels became even more useful. Now we have the wheels we have today and people are still making improvements to them. What you are suggesting seems equivalent to saying we should not have used wheels until we could make them as good as they are now, but then that would never have happened, and all the time we were not using wheels because they were not refined enough we would have lost a great deal of productivity and missed out on other innovations which were developed on top of the wheel like the steam engine, gutenberg press, etc.. and how would you have decided when they were good enough anyway? Wheels still malfunction to this day.

Why would someone who is benevolent destroy the coins? He is wise. If he is wise and he is benevolent, then he can make good use of those coins himself, so he can just keep them, and use them for good causes as they come about.

I'd say: Don't knock it 'till you've tried not knocking it. Perhaps you are unaware what you're missing out on. Some people approach it as a challenge, attempting to make 7 days, 90 days or some other arbitrary duration. Just abstaining from masturbation is kind of like increasing the sensitivity of your mouse: You will feel great and have all this extra emotional energy, but if you don't know how to channel it you are likely to just end up going back to masturbating (having a faster moving cursor is great but if you don't have the control you will be all over the place clicking at random icons). However, it's likely that once you've experienced abstinence you'll keep going back to try and figure out how to do it right. I was like that, after noticing the trend from chance situational periods of abstinence. Then I read 'Think and Grow Rich' and it all clicked: I was able to channel all that extra emotional energy into becoming the person I wanted to be through controlling my thoughts, the only thing I have direct control of.

Are there sufficient people working on Bitcoin core who have both a solid understanding of psychology &amp; economic philosophy as well as programming &amp; cryptography? Either that or are the programmers/cryptographers working on core engaging in sufficient communications with philosophers that they have the right ideas to code on? If there is not enough philosophy in the core development, we need to do something get the coders linked up with philosophers..
Is there a good place for philosophers to submit/discuss their ideas, where then the coders can review them and think of how to implement them? Does github work as well for this as code, or is it insufficient for both in the case of such a large project as Bitcoin? Do we need a new platform?

It's not so simple. That is how is appears to us but the people who understand the deeper technical details of BTC like the OPS in IRC understand that this is an abstraction which can be problematic.
There is actually no such thing as a 'from' address in the blockchain. Blockchain.info only shows a 'from address' because it analyses the blockchain and guesses it based on what 'to' addresses (addresses are only ever 'to' and never 'from) received BTC in the past and are now sending 'to' your address. I still don't understand completely though.
Apparently... As I said I'm confused. The reason I'm confused is that I'm at the point of crossing over from one level of understanding to another.
The reason it can be problematic apparently is that people assume their BTC is stored in the addresses to which they received it, but apparently it's actually not, or maybe it's just because some is also in change addresses -- I don't know, all I know is I said that you're saying, and what most people think, amongst developers and they said it was wrong and problematic, and I've just been trying to understand how/why...

OP, getting people interested in something is less about what you say and more about how you say it, and how you say it is less about planning and more about your state of mind and your personality/habits.
If you want to get people interested in Bitcoin, you will need the same skills as would help you in business, leadership, sales and relationships in general: social skills.
First I recommend a book like 'Success through a positive mental attitude', where you will learn to use everything to your advantage, e.g. if you are stuck with 'annoying' people in your work, that's a great opportunity to learn how to deal well with 'annoying' people.
Then read something like 'How To Win Friends And Influence People', where you will learn to understand other people's point of view, accept it and work with it not against it, to generally make people feel good: You will learn to be likeable.
Then do something like watch the 'The Blueprint' DVD series by Owen Cook of Real Social Dynamics, where you will learn the other core aspect of influence which is dominance. Dominance/likability are the competing personality aspects which influence others, and they must be balanced in different ways to achieve the most success in different situations as they have different outcomes.
Then practise, always: With your family, with sexual encounters, in  business, in the supermarket, on your own, etc.. Practise maintaining the state of mind which makes you dominant and likeable, and it will become natural to you, and you will then easily influence people to your way of thinking.
Like Bitcoin, influence is a tool, it is amoral. You can use it for good, evil, or something in between. I think promoting Bitcoin is a good thing, and many people here are also libertarians/anarchists which I also think is good, so I will be happy if they will learn from this post and gain increased influence over others.
Edit for additional information inspired by reading other comments here: If you understand Bitcoin well, you already know enough to persuade people of its value, you have all the angles already, you already know about which companies accept it, what impact it can have on the economy, etc... The trouble is not getting the right angles, it's getting people to want to listen to you in the first place. Planning your delivery in advance won't help you at all if they don't want to listen to you. On the other hand, if you are a person people want to listen to, you can talk about the most inane shit and they will be interested. So, if you think you have valuable wisdom, make the worthwhile investment in your social skills so that you can spread that wisdom to others. Dominance/confidence/control/assertiveness/independence/non-neediness, combined with likeability, is what you need to work on.

Personal experience (loss); reading about other peoples' personal experiences (loss); [PayPal's buyer protection policy (search 'intangible')](
"PayPal nearly always sides with the buyer in any dispute, especially disputes involving virtual goods" -- False (should be *except* virtual goods).
The propagation of this myth that it's only the sellers who are at risk with PayPal is losing a lot of people a lot of money (to scammers who know the myth is false).
Professional scammers know their stuff, they will exploit policy and practises to win on either side of the buy/sell dichotomy.

Welcome to the government. In my opinion it should be the other way around if anything... Today, the 'justice system' is a punishment system, whereas I think it should be a protection and restitution system. If a person is aggressively insane and there is no way for them to recover, and they can't/won't be able to work effectively enough to pay for their accommodation/restitution whilst in confinement, then I think it's best they are executed, unless people want to pay for their keep voluntarily! (I think theft/extortion/coercion/assault etc.. are wrong) Of course, there would need to be a trust-worthy, low/zero-trust required entity/way of deciding if this was the case.. If we gave this ability to the State they could just say anyone they didn't like was insane.

Yes. I have only invested in it because I think it is awesome in the first place. Also, with Bitcoin I am not just gambling that it will be successful, I actually want it to be successful (and am working to help it become so, through hodling, evangelising and creating) because I think it will help increase the prosperity of humanity of which I am a part. So, I would not pull out my investment because I thought it was going down, instead I would persist and even increase my efforts because I want it to succeed.
Anyway, even the richness I do want to acquire (and I do want to build riches), I want to use it for purposes similar to the reasons I support Bitcoin, I want to use my riches to advance the liberty and prosperity of humanity. Personally, I live a minimalist lifestyle, preferring to save my money and use it to make a difference (including things which really make a difference to me, like healthy food), than to buy luxuries and other things I don't need.
My focus on getting wealthy anyway is through mastery of my profession and development of my businesses, not through the increasing of Bitcoin price, which I am also invested in and trying to build through positively and productively contributing to the space. I see Bitcoin as a revolution. People fight with their lives in revolutions, they evangelise their ideology and fight to the death, we are mostly only fighting with our finances, and I think the benefits of Bitcoin being successful will be much greater than the benefits of many other revolutions people have fought and died for. I am happy to lose finances supporting Bitcoin.

It is the case... Re-read if you will... The income tax is around 30%(State + Federal), then there is property tax, then there is sales tax, and when you are buying goods from a store, the taxes of the business and its employees are factored into the price, then something like 80%(in the UK, in the USA I don't know) of the cost of fuel is taxes, etc............ Together, it adds up to 55% of the average person's income is taxed. I can look for a link for you.
This doesn't take into account opportunity costs (for investment, etc...) from missing 55% of your income, and from State regulations which further reduce people's wealth by suppressing competition and innovation.

Scientific research of that kind is extremely inefficient. There are an infinite number hypotheses they could be testing, and the chances are they are not testing the right ones. It's much better to give funding to individuals who have done their own philosophising to the point where they already have strong theories worth testing/researching scientifically. Scientific testing is like loosing the arrow in a hunt. You would have to loose millions of arrows randomly before you'd hit something; the proper way is to go on the hunt and loose the arrow only when you are in kill-range.

   What types of violence are there? Offensive and defensive.

Firstly, a 'right' is just a condition backed by force. So it's not a universal human right at this point, but it is in some places, for some people, in specific situations.
Secondly, I don't think financial privacy should be a right anyway. If financial privacy is a right, then if I find out that someone is hiring a hit out on someone else, then I would be punished for alerting the other person if the right-backers (whether govt, a citizen mob, or otherwise) found out.
I think the only human rights should be to self-ownership and property-rights over rivalrous/scarce resources based on use.

It could be that there's people with lots of BTC who want to get out, even just partially, but if they sold any other time they'd crash the price and devalue their holdings, so they wait until there is good news to sell, and because good news causes increased demand, their selling only drops the price slightly and then it can recover.

Well, I will raise my children without aggression when I have them -- and there are other people doing the same already -- and then I expect that my children will raise their children without aggression also. There is as far as I can tell a general trend in society towards less severe aggression in parenting and the raising of children as well (e.g. switching from caning to detention/timeouts), and when these children are growing up they are expecting/demanding less severe aggression in their grown-up lives.
I am also talking about non-aggressive child-raising to friends, some who had never thought about it and are now planning to raise their children without aggression also. Unless people think about it, they will tend to just raise their children the same way they were raised, or in some reactionary opposite way which is also bad.

If you can keep your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

Then, the people can trade in these physical representations throughout the day (whereas people with easy access to technology can afford to trade the bitcoins directly using smart-phones) e.g. wood-coins or rice-paper, and they can scan them once-per day or once-per week to check which ones are genuine.

Use subcommunication, not overt communication. Like how you would persuade a dog to do what you want. The dog doesn't even understand words, yet by holding the correct state of mind, the dominant, calm, in control, relaxed state of mind, your posture, way of talking, actions etc, will naturally be such that the dog will do what you want it to anyway regardless of what you say: the self, the underlying state of mind, always shows through. If you are submissive, anxious, etc, the dog will not do what you want regardless of what you say. People are a lot like dogs too, we just have a bit more logic added on top, but the base is largely the same. This works for men and women, but women are naturally more emotional, less logical, and more submissive than men, on a bell-curve, so it is even more effective -- and necessary -- on them.

You also have to consider people's motives, like some people will say things which seem irrational, but actually the person is saying those things because they have figured that saying things which seem irrational, actually gets the results he wants, which may be to convert people from irrational to rational beliefs.
For example, there is a guy called Peter Boghossian, I don't know much about him, but I read that he uses 'irrational means' of convincing Christians to become Atheists, but this is actually rational if it is more effective than using logic and evidence. Also, there is a principle of cognitive consonance, where people seek out evidence and change their beliefs etc to conform with their actions, so if you can make someone become an atheist through emotional pressure for example, then they will be more inclined look for logical reasons to support themselves being atheists.

It may be that the account you were paying to has previously been paid with stolen funds, and therefore the receiving account would be flagged as suspicious as it could be that he is stealing the funds and paying them to himself. Therefore, any payment made to that account whilst it's still flagged will cause the payer account to be temporarily suspended whilst the transaction is reviewed and confirmed as legit (usually resulting by you calling up and saying so).

I didn't, I have formed my theories based on thousands of experiences, including many articles, videos, meatspace experiences, anecdotal accounts, etc... I just went to grab a few references which were easy to find and support the theories I presented. I have not written any thesis and do not have a pre-compiled list of references.
If you are asking how anything in those links support my claims regarding logicality: The philosophical link on the bottom, as I recall, contains a great many *philosophical* arguments supporting my claims regarding logicality.
Whilst, the second link, references *scientific* studies which show that women's brains are significantly structurally different to men's: This is already a significant bit of knowledge in itself, many people would be surprised by that, many people claim that women's and men's brains are structurally identical and that the only differences occur as a result of socialisation. My interpretation of that study, is that women's right and left -- emotional and logical (simplification) -- hemispheres are on average more highly connected, meaning that their logic is 'interfered with' by emotion, reducing their capacity for pure logic (rationality, etc..), but increasing their capacity for emotional interpretation: Their 'logical' hemisphere is largely processing emotions (how should I act in response to these emotions), whereas in men it is more free to process facts (how should I act in response to these facts), not being so connected with the emotional hemisphere.
You've got to interpret these theories in relation to your own experiences, there is not a double blind placebo controlled study for everything. But, if enough people think a theory has merit based on the sum of their current experiences, then there is more chance that one of them will conduct or fund research in relation to it, to gather more data which gets us closer to the truth. Look into hypothesis-driven science vs data-driven science for some interesting info in relation to this, the former is far more efficient. There is feedback between the data and hypotheses in both cases, but it's what's driving the research primarily, where 'data-driven science' refers to where pre-existent *scientific* data is used to form hypotheses, and HDS refers to where hypotheses are formed through all available data including anecdotes, personal experiences, *and* pre-existing scientific data, before then collecting more scientific data to test the hypotheses.
I could certainly provide far more instances of existent supporting evidence for my claims than I have produced thus far, but it would take significant effort for me to do so.

Best to have enough different children, that you can let them all take lots of risks. Children who take risks and live grow to be the strongest children, but some may die or become crippled, etc..
..and actually, the most risky investments have the best returns overall, but the highest chance of failure on average. So, you're better spreading across many risky investments than you are taking a few sound investments by odds.
However, with investments, sometimes we know so much about some investment that it really makes sense to put a great portion of our capital into it. Bitcoin is something that it's possible to know A LOT about; there are few things to do with Bitcoin which are uncertain because it is code. If you think then that you know a lot about the relevant areas of philosophy, as well as enough about the relevant areas of mathematics and software development, and with all that knowledge you think Bitcoin will be worth a lot, it makes sense to bet almost everything on it, if you have self-esteem. Betting on Bitcoin I am betting on the value of what I consider my wisdom; if my wisdom is wrong then I have much more to address than the loss of some money, and if my wisdom is right, then I am going to reap the rewards of it.

Hmm... I don't see what is wrong with this idea? If I put 1 BTC with $500 market value into this safe and that releases some XXX, which I can then put back into the safe to get my BTC back, then the XXX will remain worth at least whatever the original 1 BTC is worth, though the value of that BTC might have itself changed in the time. Likewise, when I go back to the BTC, it can not be worth less than whatever the XXX is worth in its safe, because if the value of the XXX on the sidechain becomes worth less than the BTC in the safe, I can use the XXX's function as a key for unlocking the BTC instead of its function on the sidechain. It's like how gold can never be worth less than its value in electronics (though that value itself can change, and I'm aware that value is really low compared to its value as a 'store of value' and status symbol, etc, that's not the point).

You seem to be confusing game theory with free market libertarianism. Game theory describes what actions an individual might be expected to take in rational self-interest based on psychological philosophy. Free market libertarianism is a system of rules/protocols (and accompanying philosophy) imposed by force in order to try and culture a society which is the most free for individuals, and advocates of free market libertarianism often use game theory to explain why their proposed protocols for the use of force make sense (how they would culture more freedom, prosperity, happiness, etc..).
For example, free market libertarians might say that the FDA's initiation of force (based on a protocol for use of force -- government mandate -- which they oppose) is unnecessary, because the libertarian protocol for the use of force (in defense of property rights) would protect consumers, and game theory, within the framework of the libertarian protocol for the use of force, would lead to the creation of voluntarily funded organisations for consumer safety and enforcement of libertarian force protocols (voluntary police, courts, etc..).
As briefly mentioned earlier free market libertarianism proposes that force should only be used in defense of property rights. There is disagreement amongst free-market libertarians as to how property rights should be allocated, but to be a 'libertarian' one must be promoting whatever system of property rights they deem to provide the most individual liberty, so there is always 'self-ownership' for example (one can do to one's own body what one wishes), but some people think property rights should be exclusive (right to exclude, i.e. use force to prevent others using it arbitrarily) and others think they should be inclusive (right to use, i.e. right to exclude only to the extent that this is required in order to use the property in whatever way he has the right to do)...

100% super serious, at what age did you start masturbating?
If you want to be successful I recommend you start by reading the book 'Think and Grow Rich' by Napoleon Hill, it is working for me. Also, you could check out Short explanation:
Humans are driven by emotion. What's the purpose of emotions? To help us reproduce -- that's why we have them, because they helped us to reproduce, thus driving their evolution. When we masturbate we are making our subconscious think that we are reproducing, and once we have finished we lose motivation to reproduce, our lust is sated. If our subconscious thinks that masturbation leads to reproduction, the ultimate goal of life, then whenever we lust we will think of masturbation (and whatever else is associated with it, like porn). If we reassociate our lust with other things, such as building wealth, improving our personality, winning friends, dating women, improving the world/serving our fellow man, etc.. Then our lust will drive us to do those things instead. Our subconscious, thinking (correctly) that these things lead to successful reproduction, will give us whatever chemicals it deduces through its fine evolutionary tuning are appropriate to get us to do those things, and we will find ourselves doing them with motivational ease.
N.B. If you have a girlfriend and sate your lust by having contraceptive sex with her, then it will of course have the same effect as masturbation on your motivation...

The human species is made up of individuals, and value is subjective. The way we focus on providing for the well-being of the human species is by maximising the individual's freedom of choice over how he spends his time, energy and material resources, so that he can spend them in the ways which he feels provides him the most value. This means we need to create the system which maximises the aggregate freedom of choice of individuals through an equal application of law, which means an inclusive, anarchistic (applied equally to all) system of property rights, where the rights provided to resources are the minimum rights required to allow an individual to make the intended/current use of the resource and no more (a right being a condition which someone can legitimately use violence to uphold); in addition to intellectual property this also discounts arbitrary, exclusive ownership of land and resources in favour of rights to specific properties/uses of those resources, which still allow others to use those resources in ways which don't compromise formerly initiated and sustained uses (which includes sustained use of houses to rent out to others, or sustained use of factories to produce goods to sell for profit) by others.
The non-aggression protocol, by which standard it is illegitimate to instigate physical conflict over the use of rivalrous resources, would be the foundation of this system.

Everyone should do whatever the fuck they want with their money, and they will, that's the point in money. Doesn't matter whether they hodl or spend, they do what they want, that's it. If someone is going to hodl forever that's fine, if they are going to spend as if every day is their last that's fine, if they're going to diversify periodically that's fine. We could say, if everyone hodls, it increases scarcity and price goes up, but then if they did it just to cash out and get rich then the price will crash again just as quickly. Just gotta sit back and laissez faire.
HODLing and investing wisely is best for societal and individual increases in wealth, spending is a way to burn through resources wastefully and be poor, but everyone's gonna do what they're gonna do... Besides people who steal their money through inflation, taxation, fraud etc, wealth accumulates in the hands of those who use it most productively to the benefit of both themselves and others.

If the government wasn't extorting people's money and squashing competition, maybe there would be a business that does what the SEC does but better, and maybe it would offer charitable advice/help for good publicity, and also provide low-cost services to increase their market share or access a niche.
Clearly people value many government services, that's why you hear 'who would build the roads', etc... That's why without the government, you'd get a guy who would come in to build the roads, and to provide financial security, etc... Because people value those services and therefore there is money to be made from providing them, as well as many people enjoy the good feeling and reputation etc from helping others.
The reason there aren't lots of private protectors now, is because the government extorts your money to make you pay for theirs, and also limits what private protectors can do not just financially (reduced capital available because of taxation) but legally. There used to be loads of 'friendly societies' which provided easily affordable voluntarily socialised medicine to workers etc, then the government began to provide healthcare and many of these friendly societies shut down because people were already being forced to pay for the government ones; then the government placed regulations on the friendly societies preventing them from providing any valuable service and they all but vanished completely.

Anarchists are not against criminal investigations, and they're not against using violence for defensive reasons either (e.g. to force a fraudulent actor to return his ill-gotten gains). What they are against is the use of aggressive violence, such as that which is used to fund the government currently in the process of taxation (an instance of extortion).
Firstly, the State is already taking about 50% of our income, which leaves us less money to use for our own investigations, but even if we were to conduct our own investigations and attempt to enforce our own laws, the State would intervene with its aggressive violence and prevent us from doing so; we certainly could not set up any large-scale private policing organisations without them attacking us. This isn't to be defeatist, just realist, one must accept reality as it is in order to make the best of it.
So anarchists aren't against rules, only against rules which favour some over others; rules which include rulers. In fact, rules are necessary to have anarchy; without rules which people are made to follow, then some people will rule over others as they have always done. Anarchist protocols/rules/legal systems are founded on the Non Aggression Principle.

I think the drive for 'growth' (in GDP) at all costs is a result of the interest-bearing debt-based currency, due to there always having to be more money conjured to repay the interest on the money which was previously conjured, though I'm not certain this is correct.
Of course as a later commenter mentions, productive/'real' growth means increases in efficiency of productive capital and such vs people just spending more units of fiat.

No, you're not. Scammers know how to scam, if you buy BTC with PayPal the scammer will make sure you are the one paying first. Because BTC is a digital good, you are not covered for non-receipt of goods, so you will actually not be able to charge back. Of course, if the scammer is the one sending the PayPal, he will know how to pretend that he was in fact selling a physical good, so you're fucked either way unless you're the scammer, or you have put sufficient time studying how to be a scammer that you know how to avoid being scammed, in which case you will just be wasting your time because the scammer has also done that (so you won't be able to counter-scam him).

Well all value judgments are subjective, but I think what vbuterin is referring to would actually be extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is something like being cryptographically non-counterfeitable; extrinsic value is being protected from counterfeiting by men with guns.

The R.B.E. ideology specifically says that the whole world must be an R.B.E or else there is not an R.B.E. It says that the central computer must have control over *all* resources in the whole world in order to work properly, and it is the computer which decides who gets what. If you have a load of people who believe their system is the ultimate system, the best for them and for humanity, and that it can only occur if the whole world is under it at once, then this is something which is guaranteed if in any way memetically successful to lead to initiatory violence. They won't be able to accept leaving 10% of the world out of their R.B.E. if they believe they can't have the R.B.E unless 100% of the world is under it, and it is for the common good of humanity.
My definition of maximal liberty is voluntaryism, where we create a system that protects the rights of individuals use certain properties of certain resources based on their prior and continued use, so it is up to them if they want to give up this right or not, not for anyone else to decide; and where no one is above the law: and then we let what happens happen (laissez faire). In this way people are free to allocate their scarce resources (time, energy, material) in the ways which they feel return to them the most value. It also forces people to cooperate for mutual benefit, since if they want something from someone they must offer something of greater subjective benefit in return, which leads to creation of wealth -- it is positive sum as long as things go right; as opposed to if people are allowed to take things from people without their permission, in which case such interactions are likely to be negative sum because of the decreased productivity of the people who know their stuff can be taken at any time, as well as the loss in productivity when it actually occurs.
I like having machines do menial labour for me, I just want to be able to make that choice myself, at the time which is most convenient for me: not to have it imposed upon me; and likewise I want this same option for other people on an individual -- not societal -- basis.

"1) You are not alone."
I say you are. I say we, all of us, will always and ever be alone. We are born alone and will die alone. No one is coming to help us. The sooner we accept this, and get over the discomfort, the sooner we can become content with the way things are, and work *with* it, not against it. It is the same for all of us, those who accept it are able to see the terrain and navigate it more effectively; those who deny it will ever be tripping over rocks and mounds on their journey, and without the heart to see why they will seek distraction. Suicide is a form of escapism, the ultimate form. The way to end the desire for escapism is to face one's fears and discomforts square on, to allow oneself to experience that discomfort in all its force; to get comfortable with discomfort, and then to think logically about those feelings, their cause, all the possible solutions, the best of those solutions, and then to take right action. Stop doing and just be, it won’t be as bad as you imagine.

I would define violence as the use of force, or the threat thereof, against another individual human with intent to cause harm (though perhaps this definition could be further refined). So, let's say I want you to do something because I think it's right, and I don't want to harm you because I hope you will comply with my demands; if I am ultimately backing those demands up with a threat of causing harm to you, then I would call that violence.
I'll then retract my earlier question, since I do not think that violence, by my own definition, is only ever justified in the prevention of other violence.
I think that it is wrong to initiate violence against another person without his implied nor explicit consent. So, this allows people to engage in consensual violence such as duels, cage-fights, BDSM and even military battles.
However, I also do not know of any proposed human-human rule-system which does not advocate for property rights in some form or another, nor have I yet conceived of how one could exist -- and rights to anything mean that they are backed by violence (even the right to not be personally violated e.g. through the act of rape or murder is backed by violence); If I recall correctly, some refer to property rights as 'structural violence' which seems a good term. My preferred system of property rights would be one based on use, whereby individual humans, fictional entities representing multiple individual humans, or partnerships of individual humans acquire the right to continue using the properties of a resource which they have been using, for as long as any of the individuals involved continue to be using it. So, this is an inclusive rather than an exclusive form of property rights -- the right to use specific properties of specific resources, rather than the right to exclude all others from using all properties of specific resources. Therefore, the only time that the use of violence would be permitted, is to ensure that the rights-holders are not prevented, by non rights-holders, from using specific properties of specific resources.
For an example scenario of the system explained in the previous paragraph, if a tribe has always drank clean water from a particular stream, then they or anyone else would be justified according to the rules of the system, to use violence in order to prevent anyone else from infringing on the tribe's right to continue drinking clean water from that stream. So it's still a negative right, but a negative inclusive right rather than a negative exclusive right. Violence can be used to prevent a capitalist from polluting the water, and to make him pay restitution to help clean it up if he does, and to prevent him from polluting other water if necessary, but not to make other people pay to clean up the water who were not directly involved in its pollution.

Thanks. I read the Wikipedia page a few months ago, and from that I do not think the premise of the book is likely to be accurate, see: 
I think the reason they lack the domesticated grain, steeds, beasts of burden and food-animals, is because they didn't spend the time taming, domesticating and selectively breeding them as the people in the areas which have such organisms did.
Even most of the vegetables we buy in the supermarket today were non-existent just a few hundred years ago in the medieval ages. Parsnips for example were bred from tiny herbs with a strong taste, the people mostly lived off of bread (made of grains they bred from wild grains in the past) and meat (made of animals they bred from wild animals in the past).
I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on it though, as someone who's read the whole book. Perhaps the premise is largely wrong, but yet partly right in significant ways which would inform my understanding.

I have tiny amounts of Namecoin; XCP and Monero for the purpose of using and experimenting with them, not as an investment, and I don't have any ether because as goalkeeper says, it doesn't exist so it's pointless to 'own' (presale) besides as a speculative investment (whether only for personal gain or also to support attempted innovation).

Things do have intrinsic and extrinsic valu**ability**.
So there is high intrinsic valuability in the Bitcoin protocol from the solutions it offers to existing problems, which are integral to itself; but it does not have actual value unless entities value it, since valuation is subjective; it also has extrinsic valuability from the network.
Fiat on the other hand has high extrinsic valuability, because it is backed by a peripheral entity, but fairly low intrinsic valuability.

This is why we need to organise better in order to have nice things. As long as we are scattered, disconnected from each other, evil people can take advantage of us easily. Vires in Numeris, but only when the people are organised. And no, organisation doesn't mean orbiting a centralised organisation, but organising amongst ourselves, using some technology to help us.
Actually, this is one of the problems with money: it makes it easier for people to benefit from unjust actions such as theft, fraud and exploitation (the latter being a subjective judgment). Talking with some people who dislike money, but don't really know why (Communists), prompted me -- someone who generally likes money -- to think about what problems there might be which are intrinsic to money, as opposed to what came before (presumably brain-memory accounting for favours, which is also what communists advocate when they talk of a 'gift economy'). I figured that it is actually the fungibility of money that is the problem (though it also confers some benefits simultaneously). Infungible money could actually be a good thing in a stateless or otherwise liberal society, as it would allow individuals to discriminate against what money they would accept based on how that money had been transacted in the past, but also -- on the negative side -- it would allow the State to more easily force people into not accepting certain units of a money whether they otherwise wanted to or not.
The potential infungibility of Bitcoin could actually be beneficial when we achieve a stateless society, but people would be able to use the same ledger for both traceable and untraceable (fungible and infungible) transactions simultaneously; and other people could choose whether or not to accept either traceable or untraceable Bitcoins. The great thing with Bitcoin, is that you, the user are always in control over whether or not to make your transactions traceable. In order to make their transactions traceable, people would have to voluntarily choose to not use mixers, to associate their identity with their wallet, etc.. And so, people who wanted to make sure they were not doing favours for people who obtained their money (favour IOU's) in ways they consider unjust, would be able to avoid doing so.
A fungible Bitcoin would achieve everything communists desire through a money-less society and a gift economy, but without suffering from a lack of memory to suffice beyond Dunbar's number of 150 social relationships. It would just be a memory upgrade regarding the exchange of favours.

They don't need to think about it. It's not the poor natives who would use it first, but the capitalists who move in, buy up land from the Warlords/government and employ the natives as labourers in their mines, 'sweat-shops'/factories, farms, hunting reserves, etc... They would probably pay the natives with food, local currency, etc, but they would use Bitcoin to trade between each other and their customers and suppliers abroad, minimising their contact with the local currency. As the area got wealthier (as the capitalists demand drove up the value of natively produced goods/services), eventually (like, 5-10 years after the capitalists moved in) some of the workers would start to use Bitcoin, but they would benefit from increased wealth following from the use of Bitcoin before that point.

It is because money is fungible, you can't tell from looking at money that it was obtained unjustly. You must just assume that it was earned.

You could use multisig with the bank, where the bank has one private key, you have another, and you bury the third deep under ground. So, neither you nor the bank can spend the BTC without the other's compliance, but, if the bank goes rogue, shuts down or something, you can go and retrieve the buried private key and move the funds to a new multisig wallet, find a new bank and repeat.

Besides what Lejitz said, you have misunderstood even the people you are referring to.
In the term 'free market', the 'market' part is as critical as the 'free' part. A market is where people voluntarily interact with each other, exchanging goods and services; free means unrestricted. So, when people advocate a free market, they advocate for unrestricted voluntary interaction and exchange of goods and services.
In order for people to be able to freely exchange goods and services, they must be protected from people who would interfere from that (or those people must not exist), such as thieves, fraudsters, etc (as being a victim of theft, fraud, rape, etc.. is by definition involuntary)... Whether this protection is provided by the free-market itself in a self-sustaining system, or by an external government which monopolises protective serices (police, military, courts). So, fraud is not a free-market activity, and therefore not supported by advocates of free-markets.
There is a lot of understanding which generally goes behind one's advocacy of free markets, including the understanding that people will boycott the businesses of bad actors when allowed viable alternatives (which are more likely to exist under free-market conditions), which is what many people are pushing for here.

If there is a law that says, that I can not sell lemonade without a lemonade license on my own front-yard, then how is that law enforced? It is enforced through violence. If I choose to sell lemonade despite this law, then I am not using violence, I'm just selling lemonade, so therefore anyone who chooses to enforce that law, by using violence against me, is initiating violence. As I said, I'm not against violence, only its initiation. I'm not against people voluntarily arranging a duel to the death, choosing to get into a street brawl, an MMA fight, a BDSM convergence; nor am I against laws (which are enforced through violence), which are against initiatory violence, such as laws against murder; theft; fraud; assault, etc...

It also mentions that, "Nick Szabo illustrated that all three properties [of Zooko's Triangle] can be achieved up to the limits of Byzantine fault tolerance."
..and that, "Aaron Swartz [peace be upon him] described a naming system based on Bitcoin which tries to square Zooko's triangle by employing Bitcoin's distributed blockchain as a proof-of-work to establish consensus of domain name ownership. These systems remain vulnerable to sybil attacks, but are secure under Byzantine assumptions. A few months after the proposal, Namecoin was released which implements the concept."
..and, "Following Namecoin, other platforms were developed which defy Zooko's conjecture, such as Twister."

One reason why deflation can be problematic in the legacy economic system is because money enters the economy as interest-bearing credit. I.e. A lot of the money *exists* as digital credit 'loans' from banks (backed by their cash reserves or total capital inc assets, as fractions of the amount credited), which must be paid back with interest on top; so, if sufficient new money is not created, this will lead to a contraction of the money supply until there literally is not enough money in circulation to actually pay back all the loans, no matter how much value is produced. In Bitcoin, money is created without debt, and without interest.
The way in which '**money** *is* debt', is just that it functions in place of social debt, it is not actually debt. It's like a metaphor really, it kind of substitutes for social debt. However, most(?) of the money in our current financial system literally is debt, i.e. there is actually an enforceable obligation to repay that money to its issuer.

One of the problems with being black is that black people are sub-optimally efficient at synthesising vitamin D in temperate climates. That doesn't mean that being black is a problem. Being black also provides resistance to UV damage, which is especially beneficial for folic acid preservation, and allows one to be unclothed in the hot sun and thus perspire more efficiently
Likewise, one problem with fungibility (a necessary quality of 'money') is that it means you can't tell if the money was obtained justly. That does not mean that fungibility is a problem. Fungibility enables decreased transaction friction, as people do not need to carefully research each unit to determine its value.

The degree to which any system is involuntary, is the degree to which non-market interactions occur relative to market interactions. Theft of land for example is not a market interaction, it's an interaction which exists alongside the market. If I pay you to steal someone's land for me, my paying you is a market interaction; but you stealing the land is not. Then, once you've stolen the land and handed it to me, I may then rent it out, which is another market-interaction. A free market, is a market where non-market interactions are predominantly eradicated; to the degree to which non-market interactions still occur, it is not a free market.

The best way to increase the value of BTC as far as use goes (i.e. putting aside advertising, innovation/entrepreneurship etc) is to use BTC however you would like (e.g. you would like to make micropayments in fiat but you don't actually because of the fees) to use your fiat, wherever possible. So, if you would be saving $1000, then well, you can save BTC, so convert the $1000 to BTC and then save it. If you would buy a couch, then if you can do that with BTC for the same or a similar price, then convert the dollars to BTC and buy the couch. 
Just spending for the sake of spending does not increase the value of BTC. By buying a load of shit you wouldn't otherwise buy, or paying twice the price for things just to get them with BTC, you are in fact decreasing the value of BTC because you are increasing the supply. Merchants should be offering reductions for BTC payments, because of the savings they make on processing fees.

You're right, theft isn't inherently violent, nor is fraud.
I advocate a thing called the Non-Aggression Principle, which is the principle of the non-initiation of violence: that we should use violence only in defense. But, I advocate that principle within a framework of anarchist property rights, i.e. a system of property rights much like we have now, but where it is applied equally to everyone, where no one is above the law. A negative right is something which it has been decided, socially, can rightfully be upheld through violence; whilst a positive right is something which has been decided, socially, *must* be upheld through violence. I am in favour of only negative rights.
So, I am in favour of using violence only to defend people from initiatory violence, and also to defend their justly acquired property rights. Justly being a subjective value judgment, I use it here to mean property rights which have been acquired through use or through trade.
State/government regulations are enforced with the threat of violence: (from the perspective of the State) "If you do not comply; we will fine you; if you do not pay the fine; we will order you to court; if you do not go to court willingly; we will put you in handcuffs and drive you to court; if you do not allow us to force you to court, that is you try to defend yourself, we will escalate violence at our discretion up to the point of killing you if we deem it necessary.
I am not saying here whether that is wrong or right. It is much better than if they just killed you outright, certainly -- they give you a lot of chances; though I do think there is a better way. But, the point is just -- whether you think it is good or not -- that regulations *are* enforced through violence. Most of the time there is no violence, because people know it is pointless to resist, because they are massively out-powered.
The putting someone in a handcuffs, if it is against their will, is harming them I would say, likewise putting them in a cell; it fits even better with the WHO definition in the Wikipedia article. However, whether or not that is the case, the reason why the person usually complies with the handcuffing is because of the threat of violence backing it up: If you try to resist being handcuffed, violence will be used against you in order to get you handcuffed, or shot if you resist too strongly (e.g. you pull out a knife and say, "I don't want to attack you, but if you try to handcuff me again I will defend myself."
My favourite of the links is: 
I only gave you multiple links to show a range of definitions all of which back up that the State enforced regulations through violence, or the threat of violence.

The products provided are not the same. Trezor team may or may not produce the product in a more secure fashion (haven't looked into it); but they are also providing the service of developing the product, both in the first place and continually. You're incentivising innovation/product development by going with Trezor. With B-Wallet you are incentivising cheap goods production, which is good if the good is as good as the Trezor (the service is not, as it does not include research &amp; development). If it is the case though, that the B-Wallet good is produced as well as the Trezor good, then Trezor should team up with the B-Wallet team, to have them produce the hardware/goods and Trezor develop it (and the software), and then have B-Wallet pay a percentage of sales revenue to the Trezor team; this would have the best overall effect. It would increase the profits of both companies, B-Wallet would benefit from the good-will of supporting the development, as all the people currently supporting Trezor would buy B-Wallet, and there would be more total sales because of the less expensive product; we would all benefit from continued R&amp;D.
Edit: [According to Trezor]( they actually produce the Trezor cheaper than the B-Wallet is produced; the extra cost of Trezor is to fund R&amp;D, so there is no justification to buy the B-Wallet, besides that you just can't afford the Trezor. It might be better if Trezor would sell for a price to only profit on the good, and then suggest that you also pay the higher prices to help with R&amp;D, and maybe give some incentive for this if that's practical. Or maybe what they are doing is better.

Money is a token for services rendered. It's assumed that if someone has money, they got it by providing goods/services to someone in exchange for it. It's the fact that people exchange money for goods and services that gives money value. If money was only obtained from scamming people, it would be worthless; indeed the degree to which money is scammed, lowers the value of a currency. If someone has rather stolen their money, and you do favours for them in exchange for it, then you're doing favours for someone who didn't do someone else any favours, you're rewarding counter-productive behaviour. However much money is great, clearly this is a problem with money. If money knew that it had been stolen, clearly that would solve this problem, and that would be good, and that is *possible*.
I didn't say money was bad because of fungibility, I said that, literally, there is ONLY ONE SINGLE PROBLEM WITH MONEY, and that problem is the earlier mentioned one, that you can't tell it was obtained unjustly, unlike with our memory, i.e. what we used before money.
Lots of people hate money: they say it corrupts, say that it is the root of all evil, say that money should be abolished, they think it is 'dirty', but they don't really know why, they don't know what property of money makes it corrupting. They know money does things to people, corrupts them, but they don't know why. The reason why, is because you can scam someone, launder the money, and then everyone will do favours for you as though you earned them. If we had a 'gift economy', however shit that would be, because money solves a ton of problems and has ONLY ONE SINGLE FUCKING PROBLEM (come on dude, I like money, and it has ONE problem, I like other things which have many more problems  than that) as I said, this would not happen, as people would be giving gifts based on memory, and people would remember that a guy scammed a load of other people, and so they wouldn't do him favours. With money, you will likely do him favours, even if you know he scammed people, because you know that no one will know that you got your money from him.

How does a government license stop that?
I'm not against regulation, I'm against the initiation of violence. You can have regulation without initiating violence. The Soil Association does not initiate violence; Fairtrade does not initiate violence. An organisation could give its seal of approval to companies based on running background checks, requiring certain standards of security to prevent theft of user funds, with regular audits and such. So, we don't need to trust all the new companies which appear, we just have to trust this established voluntary regulatory organisation which has approved them.
I'm not against defensive violence either, like using violence to get back stolen funds, or prevent funds being stolen.
Initiation of violence is not necessary for protection against the initiation of violence. Only defensive violence is needed for that.

I'm not twisting the meaning of violence. If I am selling crack on a street corner, by what means do you arrest me if I refuse to obey your orders if not by violence? I think you are having an emotional reaction to the use of the word violence which is stopping you from thinking clearly, or perhaps you have buried the fact that you are compelled by violence in the back of your mind as a coping mechanism, and my bringing up the truth is painful. Violence is the use of physical force upon another person in order to cause harm, which can be wielded as a threat to make people comply with your orders, knowing that if they do not comply you will use violence.

Why does sub Saharan Africa have these problems?
I think they have these problems, lack of food etc, because they are lacking freedom in their markets (property rights). The parts of Africa which were conquered by (relatively) liberal States (e.g. England), and had **relatively** (and only in some areas, but also over-all on balance) freer markets created and protected by the colonists (e.g. South Africa; Rhodesia/Zimbabwe), were able to do (relatively, on balance) well economically, and avoid these blights, whilst the chaotic warlord-controlled territories just next door were starving.
Venezuelans are struggling to get soap, toilet paper etc, because their markets are being increasingly interfered with by the State there; if the interference keeps increasing, they could end up like Africa, struggling even for food; it's not because of the geographical environment, fundamentally, but the social environment.
Bitcoin is a tool which supports freer-markets (by allowing people to circumvent state (and other) coercion), which are the foundation of prosperity, and thus not-starving.

The side-chained alt-coin can not become worth less than the Bitcoin it is pegged to, and vice versa, because you can always exchange it back.
It's like how gold, hugely inflated (not saying this derogatively) as a store of value though it is, can never fall below its value as an electronics component, as a dental material, etc.. And even if gold isn't as valuable as a dental filling as it is for storing value, it will still cost at least as much to buy gold for fillings as buying gold ingots, because the guy could've sold them as ingots instead, so he's not going to sell them for less than that to a guy who wants fillings.

Whales who want to cash out sell on good news so their supply is somewhat absorbed by the increased demand -- whales have much more Bitcoin left to sell, so they don't want to bring the price down; because there is not just one whale, they each try to get as many of their own coins sold before the others force the price down, so the price inevitably overshoots before they are able to react and pull down their sell orders. If they were coordinated, or one person, they could do it without affecting the price at all, or allowing it to increase slightly, which would be much better for them collectively.

They are not unspoken rules, they're rules that the majority of people -- in terms of power -- must agree to, and then enforce those rules upon each other and everyone else. Once there becomes that critical mass of people, who believe for whatever reason, whether from the effects or from the means, that the libertarian principles ought to be the foundation of society, or that they want to live in such a society, and they start to together enforce the adherence to these principles, it becomes in everyone's interest, including their own, even if they change their mind, to mostly follow those rules until a critical mass may be reached who support alternative rules. Most libertarians still pay taxes even if they don't agree with them, because of their enforcement, likewise most statists would abide by the Non-Aggression Principle in a libertarian-majority region out of self-interest.
I also think that once people had experienced voluntaryism, that they would see the greater prosperity that this brought, and want to join in enforcing it out of their own interest; some private defence agencies would market partly by the fear of being conquered and losing their freedom, much like the U.S. State does now.


I don't know what you are saying here, are you disagreeing with me? If you'd care to elaborate..


This is not what's meant by coercion in libertarian theory. Coercion in libertarian theory assumes the presence of negative property rights; self-ownership and the NAP. Indeed, I just confirmed that the dictionary definition of coercion alligns with the libertarian usage, and not your own usage, meaning: 
* 1. the act of coercing; use of force or intimidation to obtain compliance.
* 2. force or the power to use force in gaining compliance, as by a government or police force."


Again, I don't understand what you're saying, I'd appreciate if you'd elaborate.

The money goes to the bank, which is why they're allowed to loan it out at interest. Loan, meaning that by using the money, the other person is indebted to the bank, the bank owns their debt (the money is debt), and is allowed to charge interest for it.
Like, if the government would tax you to build me a free car, so that I can rent it out to people, the other person would be in control of the car whilst they were using it, but I would own it really, since they must pay me to be allowed to use it, and must return it in good condition.

? You and the bank must sign for funds to be moved, meaning if someone steals your private key, they have to persuade the bank that they are you so they will sign to move the funds, just like today; except that the bank can not themselves move the funds without getting you to also sign, unlike today; and, if the bank is not cooperating, you can ultimately take control of the funds yourself through an exhaustive process of recovering the buried private key (unlike today). That 'buried' private key, could alternatively have been stored with a 2nd bank, which gives more control and security over your funds than today, but less than if you hid the 3rd private key yourself.

I think it's generally non-bank financial companies whom the central bank buys the debt from.
Also, I did not know they are forced to sell the government-debt to the central bank, I thought the central bank just paid them more money than the debt was worth, and so the NBFCs could then reinvest into higher-yielding assets (i.e. they act from self-interest incentives, not coercion). I don't know though, and of course it could be different from country to country, but I'd like to hear what you know.
Also, what this means is that the wealth is being transferred to the Central Bank (who is buying debt-assets with reserves it created from thin-air); and also possibly some to the NBFCs depending on who is right (me or you) about the nature of the asset-purchase.
Afaik commercial banks are generally just used as middle-men in this process, between the CB and the NBFCs, but they do potentially benefit from holding the increased reserves transferred to them from the central bank in exchange for them crediting deposits to the NBFC's account. I'm not sure how much of a benefit or not that is. Do they receive equal nominal value in reserves to what they create in deposit liabilities for the NBFC? If so, it increases their liquidity and allows them to make more loans, so it would be a benefit to the commercial banks also.

Just because I observe there is a problem with something, that doesn't mean I think that thing is a problem in itself. Money is not a problem, but there is a problem with money.
It wouldn't ruin the entire point of money, it would be an alternative to money which would offer some of its benefits (some of its 'points'), and not others; which would solve the one and only problem that there is with money, whilst creating other problems of its own.

There are problems, or negatives, with fungibility; there are positives to fungibility. The way in which I am using 'problem' here could be interchanged with the term 'negative'.

Even if the very facets of money which create the negativity even create positivity of their own, which even outweighs the negatives?

He said contracts between individuals, voluntarily agreed to, not imposed by a third party. The contracts are not the foundation of libertarianism however, they are something which is made possible by the foundation, which is, 1) Ownership of the self; 2) Non-Aggression Principle; 3) Property rights acquired in some 'fair' way, such as first use, or 'mixing of labour', depending on the particular libertarian system.
Then, once you own yourself, follow the NAP, and can acquire property rights in external things which you need to function, then you can have the contracts between each other (such as trading some property rights for others), relating to the properties you have rights to, and the self-body you own. You can't trade your ownership of self, or following of the NAP, or your ability to acquire property rights, as these are the foundations of libertarianism.

This (having to pay rent or be a labourer on someone else's means of production) was the same in England before the industrial revolution, indeed it is largely the case now still. But yet we are not starving. The people in Rhodesia were not starving either, when the white people moved in, bought land and ran farms there; indeed it was known as ["the bread-basket of Africa"]( The reason why it was the bread-basket of Africa, was because the white government there at the time protected property rights, which lead foreign people to invest in the country, to buy land and to build up enterprises such as productive farms on it, as they were confident that someone was not going to take it from them after they had cultivated it; and also because no one did take it from them in the middle of their cultivating it. The white farmers employed the Africans on their farms, and the Africans benefited from the wealth created there. When the white government was replaced by an African government, and the country was renamed to "Zimbabwe", the African government set its 'war veterans' to go and seize the white-owned farms, but rather than taking them over and running them, they burnt them down. Now the people there are poor and starving again.

Because there are lots of people who come here to pump the altcoins they're invested in, and most of them are not invested in those altcoins for sound reasons. E.g. They either believe, or are pretending to believe, that faster block-times means it is more advanced than Bitcoin; that it is more secure because it uses more hash-functions or because the NSA created SHA-256, or that it is 'ASIC resistant' (and this is a good thing), etc... So there are loads of these coins that are either created as, or just used as, pumps and dumps, to scam people out of their money by tricking them into thinking it's the replacement for Bitcoin; and people are concerned that might be what I'm doing. It's touchy therefore to bring up altcoins here. Lots of people are investing in all of these altcoins because they're afraid of 'missing the boat' on the rise of the 'Bitcoin 2.0'. Lots of people who come to this sub aren't educated enough yet in Bitcoin to understand that these are just scams.
The other thing is, because so many people are invested in the Bitcoin Blockchain, and we are trying to get more people to invest in it, so we don't want ourselves and those other people to lose their money because Bitcoin loses to some other protocol. We don't want people to be thinking that's a likely outcome, because it isn't, since the most important problems are solved by Bitcoin itself, and it is working now, and a strong network effect is essential to us reaping the humanitarian benefits which Bitcoin will effect. Any altcoin that has extra features also has extra risks, and money is fundamental, and its security critical; and none of those features are as valuable as the core ones provided by Bitcoin itself.
Probably other reasons I haven't recalled here also.
Most people here have probably gone through a phase of reading about all the other altcoins, trying to think which one might bubble, and now they have altcoin-fatigue, so they can't even look at interesting features of altcoins that might be beneficial incorporated into sidechains in the future, etc..

Yes, the government owns the land, but the government acquired ownership of the land through conquer, which is not a legitimate way to acquire land *under libertarian principles*. The government is an organisation, which rules over the land, like the other warlords who came before it. The modern State is an evolution of the monarchies, as the monarchies were an evolution over whatever kind of warlords came before them. Their territories are larger, and their rule is more stable, as were those of the monarchies over whatever you'd call what came before. 
The government can not physically control everyone in its territory, so it must make the benefits (e.g. not getting jailed) of compliance greater than the costs (e.g. getting taxed) for most people, so that they will accept it. One way to decrease the costs is to be more liberal, to let people vote for representatives, etc, States which offered more freedom were able to defeat or take territory from the ones which offered less. A way to increase benefits which was employed by some monarchies is to say the king is ordained by God, so they think that by rebelling they would be acting against the will of God, so that increases the cost of rebellion (and thus benefit of compliance); another is to make the people think they are the government, so if they rebelled they would be rebelling against themselves. People who are freer are also more productive, the results of which can be used to make a stronger military.
Yes, the whole world is the result of thousands of years of action, but not all actions are market actions. The market specifically refers to voluntary associations, contracts between individuals, actions free of coercion. Theft, extortion, conquer, etc are not market actions, they are actions which exist alongside the market. A free market is specifically a market (humans making contracts between each other on an individual basis) which is not regularly/habitually interfered with through coercion; i.e. the people who think there should be free markets are mostly in control in that particular environment, save the odd robbery/murder they can't prevent; the less theft/coercion/extortion/murder/rape etc that there is, the freer the market is.
If we got rid of the government, or the government decided not to interfere with anything to do with Bitcoin, that would not be a free market. It would only be a free market if we were able to create our own means (such as private institutions and/or tools) of preventing theft/fraud/extortion, such that it was a very minor aspect of the environment. A government could potentially exist which only uses extortion/taxation to fund its military, police and courts (those would not be free markets; the extortion of the funds to pay the police would not be a market action, but the paying of the police would be a market action, it's not a free market because the coercion is regular, habitual, institutionalised, pervasive), for the purpose of creating and protecting free markets in the rest of the economy.
The market in the U.K. is freer than the market in France; in the U.S. the market in software is freer than the market in utilities (gas, etc..); there is less habitual coercion in the former markets respectively.

I am actually working on building a voluntaryist communo-capitalist society, which combines the best of communism and the best of capitalism in a voluntary way. Dunbar's number is 150, and is the number of people whom we can know well enough to live effectively with in a truly communistic way (based on our ability to remember people's characters, and favours or harms they've done, etc..), so the end goal is that we will have loads of gated communities, each ~100 people in size, where the facilities in each community are communal amongst members of the community (everything except private sleeping quarters), but then we use money and reputation databases to aid in interaction with people outside of the communities. These communities surround trade hubs, where non-home-based business are located, and these trade hubs are interconnected by train linking to larger trade hubs. 
This is not just some all or nothing thing, I have started implementing these ideas already by founding a distributed local activism organisation, where we form into groups of ~100 people and are united by the Non-Aggression Protocol as well as some other core tenets (a notable one being, that we seek to make the world better through both our ends *and* our means); there are other important social/cultural structures which make it work well. The larger we grow the more of an impact we will be able to have on the world. It is in the early stages so things are still being worked out at a low level, and I have been closely involved in the formation of all of the groups currently active; in the future I will be sharing templates based on what has worked best so that other people can effectively start groups in their local areas which will be well-connected with those already in existence.

Why are you asking here? You have to weigh it up for yourself, value is subjective. If you can afford to be without your car, then go for it. Cars have a rapid depreciation of their value, so the sooner you can get rid of it the better.

Poor people would be better off in a voluntaryist society, because value is subjective. Poor people would be free to use their limited resources in the ways which give them the most value. They would not be forced by housing regulations to live in expensive accommodation, if they would rather build their own [wooden house]( and use the money for something else, including doing less work, and maybe studying or doing whatever else they happen to value more than a regulated home; the poorest people, the unemployed, would not be forced to only do work which is worth the minimum wage, they could do odd jobs for other poor people, which the other poor people can't afford to pay someone minimum wage to do; they could do organic farm labour, which is a very pleasant job for people who like being in nature, but is not economical to employ anyone in that position who is not a metaphorical machine (currently if someone wants to be an organic farm labourer, and they are not capable of, or don't want to work like the terminator to earn minimum wage, they must instead work for free, and many people choose to do this -- in exchange for food and accommodation -- because they enjoy the job, but would rather earn 3/4 minimum wage or whatever they're capable of if they were allowed to); and they could live in a log-cabin on the farm site, which would be warm being well insulated and heated with a wood-fire, unlike the tin shacks which farm-labourers must suffer the winter through now, paying out of their arse for electric heating all the while (because of housing regulations). 
Anyone would be free to open up cheap/free accommodation, in their gardens, for people who would otherwise be homeless, getting them off the streets and into a base from where they could move upwards, if they wanted.. Having a shed to sleep in, an outhouse, and an outdoor tap for water would be massively better than being homeless, but currently people won't do it because it's illegal (housing regulations). 
Organisations, such as the YMCA, which provide relief and accommodation for homeless people, would be able to house more than 20 homeless people per large city, because they would not be forced by the housing regulations to provide an all-inclusive suite for each individual (bathroom; double-bed; large living space etc..), when there are hundreds more who would be really glad to just get off the street and sleep in a hall or a closet; they could provide efficient communal accommodation instead.
It would also not be [illegal]( to feed the [homeless]( and even in places where it is legal to feed them, the police would not [seize wild game donated to them by hunters because of food-regulations against meat killed with lead-shot](
In a voluntaryist society, poor people who work in Walmart would not be forced to subsidise middle-class people's university loans. Poor people would be able to live amongst rich people, by living more people to a house like in old days, allowing them to live in areas with better safety, work and social prospects, rather than being forced to live in ghetto's (housing regulations again) with only other poor people to look up to. In a voluntaryist society there would be no guaranteed benefits for single mothers, incentivising them to have as many children as they like and not choose a reliable father for them, leading children to grow up without any good male role-models, leading them to look up to gangster rappers and such for idols (which means they stay poor, because not many people can make a living as a gangster rapper, and wannabe ganster rappers don't make good accountants).
Poor people would save money due to increased competition amongst providers of currently state-protected/rent-sought services such as telecoms; energy; [healthcare]( They wouldn't be forced to pay for police who shoot them, beat them up and kill their dogs for dealing and smoking weed; they wouldn't be forced to sit through state-school which for people who don't want to be there, because they'd rather go and work instead and earn money or something, is just like a prison, and [leads to the same behaviour and social patterns]( for people who don't want to be there, as prisons.
I've written quite a lot there, and I could go on and on, but I'll stop for now, and give you a chance to read and then ask any particular questions you might have, such as about specific ways in which you suspect poor people would be worse off, and then I'll respond to that.

I don't want to live past my natural death point, I'd rather pass my memes and genes on to my children and have them continue in my place (and the memes on to other people as well). For this reason, I will still choose to continue accumulating wealth (which is not just money but also character, environment, relationships, etc..) even if I know I am going to die soon, so I can pass it on to my children along with my genes and memes, so they can use it to continue in my wake. It is not only my children I care about, and want to pass my wealth and memes on to: I care about all people in the order of those who share with me the greatest magnitude of genes and what I consider to be beneficial memes, to those who share the least: therefore I put my children first after myself, with siblings and other anarcho-liberals coming after them.
Another reason I want to die of old age and have my children continue in my place is that they are much healthier than I am. I was able to learn much about nutrition* that my parents didn't know or care about, and have used this knowledge to produce children who are much more well developed physically than I am.

"the world is a zero sum game"
Doesn't voluntary trade (which means also not fraudulent/deceptive -- if its fraud then you didn't agree to the trade which actually occurred) increase the wealth in the world? People only engage in voluntary trade if they perceive that what they are gaining is more valuable than what they're giving (meaning it's win-win and thus is an increase in wealth). This leads to people specialising and innovating, developing new productive processes and technologies, which further increase wealth.
Natural resources are only so many, but our technological advances allow us to make use of natural resources which were previously useless to us, or which we were unable to access. Oil for example was previously just some annoying goop which occasionally got in the way when mining for minerals, if I recall correctly.
I think that the problems are caused by involuntaryism: preventing people from directing their scarce resources (time, energy, material) towards the ends which they feel provide them with the most value, and thus limiting the wealth which can be created.

Actually, the effect of buying her things on her sexual attraction to you will depend very much on how you go about it.
If you act (genuinely) that it is no big deal, or that you are buying her the thing for you (jewellery to make her look good when she's with you; magic wand so you can enjoy making her squirm), then that is fine. If you give it to her as a gift for her, act like it is a big deal/'make a big deal of it' (even implicitly), act like she should be thankful and like you expect something (anything, including just good will) form her in return, then it will decrease her sexual attraction towards you... This is because it demonstrates that you are lower sexual value than her, and therefore must contribute other value to make up for it.
This is all subconscious... A woman won't know that this is why she is losing attraction to you -- unless she's studied evolutionary inter-gender psychology -- she will come up with some other rationalisation.

People who got Bitcoin early don't necessarily feel the need to keep all of their Bitcoin as they have so much, and it's these people who are driving the price down through purchasing; it's not bad nor good, it just is. One good thing is that it spreads the BTC out more evenly potentially.
They may not want to sell, some of them, because they want to support BTC, but they would actually like to have some things, and when they purchase from a retailer they are supporting BTC in a way by encouraging merchant adoption and publicity, so they feel like it's O.K. to sell in that way.

What do you mean?
BIP101 does not propose to increase the average blocksize, it proposes to increase the maximum blocksize.
In Jul 2010 the limits of setting a max-blocksize were tested at a ratio of 2500:1 (max-blocksize:average-blocksize), and a ratio of 2.5:1 is being tested right now. BIP101 proposes a max-blocksize which would put us at a ratio of 20:1, something which has already been tested in mid-2012.
In order to test new limits of max-blocksize:avg-blocksize ratio, we would need to increase the max-blocksize to &gt;1000mb at the current avg-blocksize, creating a ratio of &gt;2500:1, and a max-blocksize that large would not be caused by BIP101 until 2030, by which time I would expect the avg-blocksize to have already grown substantially (thus bringing the ratio to within the limits of what has already been tested).
What we haven't tested yet is what happens when the avg-blocksize hits the max-blocksize (or even gets up to a 0.8:1 avg-blocksize:max-blocksize ratio), which is what BIP101 is trying to avoid.

In anarcho-capitalism you also can not give up self-ownership.

The max blocksize was already WAY higher than the average blocksize when it was first implemented, and only now are we hovering around 50% capacity. The ratio of the '1mb max-blocksize':'average-blocksize' was for a long time much higher than would be the ratio of an '8mb max-blocksize':'0.4mb average blocksize'.
In the above link you can see, that having an 8mb max-blocksize at the current 0.4mb average blocksize (20:1 ratio), is equivalent to the situation we had in mid-2012, when the average blocksize was 0.05mb, with a 1mb max-blocksize.
When the 1mb max blocksize was [first implemented]( in mid-2010, the average blocksize was only 0.0004mb, that's a ratio of 'max blocksize':'average blocksize' of 2500:1, 12500% of the 'max blocksize':'average blocksize' ratio which we would have today, following the hypothetical immediate implementation of BIP101's 8mb max-blocksize.

I never said explicitly that: 'men are better inventors than women', but you said I implied it, so I'm trying to figure out what you mean by those words.
Imagine there is a country A, with a population of 100,000, and 10% of them play Ice-hockey; and there is a country B with a population of 105,000, and 0.5% of them play Ice-hockey, and the players in A are on average significantly more skilled than the players in B, and A wins almost every world championship, say 99.99% of them.
The people in A and B are both as physically capable, but the people in A have more desire to play and be good at Icehockey, so more of them play Icehockey, and the ones who do spend more time playing it.
Is A better at Icehockey than B? I'd say that on average the people of A are better at Icehockey than those of B, and that collectively, A is better than B at Icehockey.
If there was to be a bet on who will win the next championship, I'd say that the chance it will be B is almost nil.


Cryptography and Economics are learned skills. There are far fewer women in these fields, and of the women who are in those fields, their average skill is below the average skill of the men in those fields.

I don't see how your claim ("this is not true") follows from your argument.
I didn't say that almost all people have learnt and do implement good security practices; I said they could if they cared enough. The people you're talking about, unless they're among the small fraction of the population who are mentally retarded, just don't care enough to learn.
You telling them not to do something =/= them caring enough not to do it.
Learning and implementing good security practices is not actually hard (as in difficult), it's just overly tedious (lots of effort) for someone who doesn't see sufficient value in it.

"Bitcoin shares the same flaw as capitalism, it requires infinite growth and we only have finite resources."
That's not capitalism (which is private ownership of the means of production; or of all non-vacant resources); it's actually caused by interest-bearing debt-based fiat money.
Almost all of the fiat money in almost all countries in the modern era is created as debt/credit, and usually bears interest at the time of its creation, meaning that more money must be borrowed in order to pay off the previous debts, so people must overall find a way to turn the money they are credited into more money by the time they have to pay it back, meaning economic growth.

The appropriate fee and the bidding is something different. There is already a way to calculate which fee will be required to get into the next block, etc, and so you could have the wallet query the server to set the fee which should have that effect. 'The appropriate fee' just refers to which fee is expected to get your tx within a number of blocks which satisfies you.
The bidding is something else, which is for when whatever fee you enter is not actually enough to get into the block, e.g. because block sizes are full and people are entering higher fees to get in. I don't think there should regularly be full blocks, I think we should have block size increases, but until the block size is increased this would be a useful coping mechanism, and also even if we have hard-coded scheduled increases, then there may be greater growth than anticipated at some point and we temporarily hit the limit anyway. 
So you set your minimum and maximum fee, as well as your increment, and then the wallet tries to send the tx, waits a certain amount of time to see if it is included in a block, and if it isn't, then it automatically rebroadcasts the tx with the incremental fee until either it hits the max fee specified or the tx is included in a block. This prevents people having to manually keep entering higher fees.

Who else uses this definition of money laundering?
As far as I'm concerned, money laundering just means cleaning money, cleaning it of information which leads people to consider the money 'dirty'.
Why allow the government to extort people at all? Why not make it compete for custom in the market, so that people will not be made to pay for the prosection of victimless criminals, when this is not a measure they support? Once the government has people's money, it can do what it wants with it. It has too much power.
@_date: 2015-04-04 15:30:53
There is a bonus to the first person who breaks the cartel agreement, he gets all of the customers he can process until the others start breaking and join him too. Then, the competing organisations drive each other down until they are making the minimum acceptable profit. Even then, if another organisation thinks they can provide the same service more efficiently, e.g. with new technology or processes, then they will step in and further drive down the costs.
When there is a state, the cartelised industries prevent anyone from breaking from the cartel through the use of state power, through minimum price-fixing, licensing, burdensome compliance, etc.. (all backed by threat of violence)
Certainly, there is a danger that in a free market, that some organisations who want to cartelise will band together and try to start a new state, but even if they succeed we would only end up back where we are. Besides, the only way we would get a fully free market in the first place is if enough people came to believe in the illegitimacy of the state, in which case anyone would find it hard to establish a new state, since its power comes from perceived legitimacy by the populace, the same populace which already chose anarchy instead.
@_date: 2015-04-01 07:54:34
By the way, I disagree that these measures would increase freedom even of the sort which you describe (freedom from want).
It might seem as though they would, when looked at in isolation. For one thing, in order to extort the people who have a lot you have to have a State, and a state is a magnet for anyone who seeks power over others for whatever reasons. People who want power more than anything else, will do whatever it takes to get power, and these are the people who will win in the competition to take control of the state. Then there's no reason that the state will stick to the original mandate which you gave to it, the people in charge or the people seeking to be in charge, will do whatever gives them more power, or allows them to keep the power they have.
Taxes are not the only form of coercion in society, and taxes are no small problem anyway... Once the money is seized, there's no guarantee the state will use it only for what you want it to be used. The state will use the money it has seized to gain further power, to fund war, to bribe business men, to bribe the general populace, etc.. The reason why we have such large and immoral corporations is because they have lobbied the state for protective legislation, such as subsidies and onerous licensing requirements. These kinds of corporations would not last, and indeed would never come to be in the first place, in a free market.
I also care deeply about freedom from want, and I think the maximisation of liberty, the minimisation of coercion, is the best way to maximise freedom from want.

Indeed, the maximum freedom for one person, would be to allow him to do anything he wants (including to rape, steal, murder, etc..), and to force everyone else to do everything he wants.
Libertarians advocate for the maximum degree of individual (granted to all individuals equally) liberty which is possible on aggregate. Meaning, they advocate for the legal system (system for determining the legitimate and illegitimate use of violence), which treats all individual people equally, regardless of race, gender, uniform, title, etc, and which provides them on aggregate the greatest liberty.
So, many libertarians advocate the Non-Aggression Principle, which is concisely defined as: "The principle of not instigating physical conflict over the use of rivalrous resources."

Freedom as in liberty is freedom from involuntary interactions such as coercion and fraud, that's what libertarians care about in their capacity as libertarians. Individual libertarians may also care about freedom from want; freedom from gravity; freedom from the laws of nature, etc, but that's not freedom as in liberty, which as the name suggests, is the kind of freedom which libertarians want foremost to maximise.
As I said, individual libertarians may care about these other kinds of freedom, but they will seek to increase them within the framework of maximal liberty, meaning they will advocate voluntary means of increasing these kinds of freedom, rather than involuntary means such as coercion and fraud. A libertarian will not sacrifice liberty for freedom from want. He may advocate a universal basic income for example, but he might seek to implement it through donations incentivised through reputation. If the libertarian UBI proponent can create a software system which records how much different people/businesses are contributing to UBI, and he persuades enough people that UBI is valuable, then this can lead to social losses to people who don't contribute what is perceived to be their fair share, which can mean loss of business; loss of friends, etc..
Coercion means when one person or some people persuade/s another/others to do something through force or threats; being poor is not coercion. It's possible for someone to be poor because of coercion, and property rights are coercive as well. A libertarian would seek to have the system of property rights which leads to the least coercion. For me, that means I advocate inclusive property rights based on use rather than private property, meaning that coercion cannot be used unless someone is depriving you of your use of some resource (that you already have the habit of using), as opposed to being allowed to coerce someone for any arbitrary reason simply because they've stepped within your territory, as in the case of private property.

The state is by definition the organisation which holds the monopoly on the legitimate use of initiatory violence within a given territory.
It would be a critical component of a libertarian society, to have proper control and influence structures in place so as to prevent people from violating the NAP as much as is practical (and without violating the NAP in the process^*), as well as market-influence structures to prevent anyone from acquiring such disproportionate wealth that it would be easy for them to violate the NAP and get away with it if they wanted to, **e.g.** to teach people that it is dangerous to allow any one person/organisation to get too disproportionately wealthy, and then have companies use this in fear-based advertising to draw custom from their larger competitors. We have seen some of this in Bitcoin, with users teaching the public that it is bad to allow any pool to get too large, and competing pools then advertising based on the fear of one competitor growing too large.
^* The state, for guaranteed, extorts you of ~55% of your income every year when all taxes are combined, if you are the average person living in the US/UK, in order to fund its protection racket among other things.


I'm working on it, along with a growing number of other people, and I am not in a rush. It is not necessary for everyone to abide by the NAP by the goodness of their own hearts, in order to have a libertarian society; we only need to have enough people who stand by the NAP in the first place to get the ball rolling, to the point where it becomes -- at minimum -- like taxation is today: Many people would rather not pay taxes if they could get away with it, but they still think taxes are important and want everyone else to pay them. Because almost everyone wants everyone else to pay taxes, even almost all of the people who would rather not pay, end up paying anyway, because of the (violence and social ostracism backed) pressure imposed by almost everyone else. I think that in a NAP-aware population, both the support for, and voluntary compliance with the NAP, would be much higher than the support for, and voluntary compliance with taxation today.

Value is subjective and many resources (including time) are scarce. Increased liberty allows people increased freedom of choice to allocate their scarce resources in the ways which return them the most value. You can't increase someone's wellbeing by forcing them to stop smoking, even if it would improve their physical health in isolation, because value is subjective. In order for quitting smoking to improve someone's wellbeing, they would have to do so of their own choice, because of changed values. If they value smoking more than not being out of breath for example, then forcing them to stop smoking will decrease their wellbeing. If you can convince someone that the benefits of voluntarily quitting smoking outweigh the costs, then they will want to do so and succeeding will then increase their wellbeing.

"The Integrity, Self-Control, and Corruption Argument
It is a fact of human nature that the only person who can think with your brain is you. Neither can a person be compelled to do anything against his or her will, for each person is ultimately responsible for his or her own actions. Governments try to terrorize individuals into submitting to tyranny by grabbing their bodies as hostages and trying to destroy their spirits. This strategy is not successful against the person who harbors the Stoic attitude toward life, and who refuses to allow pain to disturb the equanimity of his or her mind, and the exercise of reason. A government might destroy one's body or property, but it cannot injure one's philosophy of life. - Furthermore, the voluntaryist rejects the use of political power because it can only be exercised by implicitly endorsing or using violence to accomplish one's ends. The power to do good to others is also the power to do them harm. Power to compel people, to control other people's lives, is what political power is all about. It violates all the basic principles of voluntaryism: might does not make right; the end never justifies the means; nor may one person coercively interfere in the life of another. Even the smallest amount of political power is dangerous. First, it reduces the capacity of at least some people to lead their own lives in their own way. Second, and more important from the voluntaryist point of view, is what it does to the person wielding the power: it corrupts that person's character."

Since it's software, and each person could use different software, then whoever the user decided would determine it would determine it. This means there could be some competing options.
At this point, I've been thinking about people with private keys which have previously corresponded to the same tokens being able to flag the tokens as stolen; then the tokens show up as blacklisted in the person's own software only so that he is able to track them, then he has to convince some committee or percentage of users to concur that it's stolen, and then the tokens will be flagged as stolen for everyone using that software.

Blacklisting of stolen coins is something I would support, as long as:
1) **All** major wallet software is designed to detect stolen coins, so you won't get some poor people unknowingly accepting stolen BTC only to find no one else will. The stolen BTC can be cut off at the source.
2) We choose to **only** blacklist *stolen* (whether by fraud; extortion; theft, or other) coins, and not coins used for voluntary but illegal trade such as drug dealing, prostitution, activism (e.g. Wikileaks), etc...
This would massively decrease the incentive for theft. 
On the first point, the challenge would be in dealing quickly with false alarms, whilst also registering the coins stolen fast enough to prevent someone accepting them as clean.
On the second point, the challenge would be in convincing most people to only use software which blacklists stolen coins and not coins used in other illegal activities.
We won't get either point perfect, but I think we could do a pretty good job.

I've watched some of those shows in full, and it's not crazy in the context.
For example: The thing about women choosing the arseholes creating evil... He's talking about women who voluntarily have children with abusive men, the men abuse the children and then the child becomes abusive too. He tries to show everyone how they are responsible for their own actions, so hopefully they will act better. He's not saying that men who are abusive are not bad as well, but it takes two to tango, the cycle of abuse has to end somewhere, and he can only make one argument at a time. Also, since most people are of the opinion that wives of abusers are only helpless victims, it would not be so worthwhile for him to spend time arguing that (that it's the man's fault) as it is for him to make the counter (but not contradictory) argument: that women who have children with and stay with abusers are also responsible for the abuse, and they act like helpless victims to avoid responsibility for their choices. When made to feel responsible, people are more likely to change their ways.
It's a philosophy show, so naturally he's often talking about topics in ways that are unintuitive to many people, so if you just get snippets it's going to sound crazy. I'm not saying he's always right either... When I've listened to his shows in the past I've disagreed with many things he's said, gained great insight from others, and generally approached it like I'd approach any philosophical conversation; I don't ignore someone completely because they're not right all of the time, I take good and leave the bad.

Different libertarians have slightly different ideas of how to best achieve this based on their varying understanding of the mechanics of the world, so some believe in anarcho-capitalism, some in the Non-Aggression Principle and voluntaryism; some in minarchism, etc...
This means that libertarians will be fine with individuals choosing to do their own KYC/AML checks, and then other individuals choosing whether or not to do business with people doing KYC/AML checks, but they will not be fine with one person forcing another to use KYC/AML checks, as this reduces the liberty of individual humans on aggregate.
In a free market, many individuals would choose only to do business with organisations which voluntarily subscribe to their preferred regulatory bodies, and which voluntarily agree to use KYC/AML checks.

This would actually be a huge breakthrough in monetary technology, if we could have money which knew if it had been stolen, whilst being *otherwise* fungible.
If we think back to the origins of money, it was an externalisation of our memory of good will/favours rendered, which is what we relied upon before money and which was only practical amongst the small groups of people whom we knew well (we can only know up to ~150 people -- Dunbar's number -- well enough for us to form with those people a functional favour-based society). Certainly, we would feel no good will towards someone for stealing food from another person, yet with money as it has existed thus far we would treat him as though he had rendered a valuable service. This is the only *intrinsic** setback of money in general as it has existed thus far.
*If you're wondering, the only other setback is that, since we evolved in an environment where engaging in favour-based exchange was criticial for survival, if we do not experience enough of such exchange it leaves in us an emotional deficiency. However, this is not intrinsic to money, as we could still just as well engage in favour-based exchange within our small communities, and then use money to exchange with the world beyond, with people whom we do not know well and thus could not effectively engage with in favour-based exchange anyway. So, it's a case of using  technology improperly, as opposed to being a problem with the technology itself (it's extrinsic).

People will hold Bitcoin like they used to hold gold in the age of the gold-standard. Banks will hold lots of Bitcoin in cold-storage, and will use it to settle between each other; whilst most people will spend Bitcoin-backed bank-currency in day-to-day transactions. Many people will also keep some Bitcoin in their own cold-storage vaults, for long-term value protection.
This is the extreme case scenario in the low-transaction-capacity direction. We may end up at the other end (Bitcoin used for day-to-day transactions), somewhere in between, or with multiple chains, possibly side-chains, for different uses. E.g. Bitcoin for maximum security/decentralisation; Sidecoin for maximum efficiency (as far as functioning -- still somewhat decentralised -- blockchain currencies go).

Yes, because the last potential holdout for fiat, if BTC continued to gain adoption, would be the payment of taxes. If it comes to the point where people are only using fiat to pay taxes, but they can also pay with Bitcoin, then they're likely to just pay with Bitcoin instead; and if no one particularly wants dollars for anything, because Bitcoin is better and dollars aren't even needed for taxes, then even the government is going to prefer to have Bitcoin.
I'm going to have a think now about what would happen if the government did require that people use fiat for taxes, but this was the only thing people used it for.

Well, non-aggression in this context refers to: Not assaulting; not murdering; not stealing; not raping; not extorting; not coercing, and other similar acts of offensive (as opposed to defensive) intrusion into other people's lives.
I think it is normal for humans, if they find a principle which seems to work, to try to universalise it. If it fails somewhere then the principle is flawed and needs to be revised; it is the same in physics.
From my observation, it seems that in (at least) most ways, human relations and thus society, function best when we do not commit acts of aggression (as defined earlier) against each other, and the laws and moral codes of successful -- in terms of cultural evolution -- societies largely reflect this.
Through history, many people have changed the structure of societies by setting examples of behaviour, which were initially unusual and perhaps in many ways unbeneficial for the early adopter as a consequence of his standing out, but which were later adopted by the masses, at least in part.
Examples are: (The story of) Jesus Christ; Gandhi; Socrates; Turing; Martin Luther King, Jr.

Most people already use the NAP in some aspects of their lives but not in others; they are inconsistent. Generally they use it in the areas of their lives where it is socially normal, and not in the areas where it is socially abnormal. NAP-adherence is enforced in the law in some areas and not in others; NAP-adherence is supported socially through ostracism and reputation in some areas and not in others.
Law is backed by threat of violence. Law can be effectively enforced when it has the support of most of the people. Law can be based on principles. People can follow principles. People can suffer negative reputation costs from being found out as breakers of principles which most people support. People can obey a law, even if they don't agree with it, because of the incentive created by its enforcement. People can agree with a law in general, and think it should be enforced on everyone else, but still want to break it themselves; if everyone thinks this, and so everyone is enforcing it on each other then it creates a strong incentive not to break the law.
Computers interact with each other according to protocols. People can interact with each other according to protocols. Protocols can instruct computers to enforce rules upon other computers; protocols can instruct people to enforce rules upon other people.
It is a practical solution which I reached through pragmatic consequentialism; this was a short post making an analogy between computer protocols like Bitcoin, with a government/society based on the NAP; people here already understand how Bitcoin works, so it makes sense to try and explain a new concept in an analogy to Bitcoin. Of course this one short post does not address every problem in society and how it is solved through the proposed NAP-based society (where applicable), do you think that would be a reasonable expectation?
"people don't ... get violent with each other just because they aren't [~~smart~~ wise] enough to agree on a [~~legal~~ peaceful] way to solve their problems", I disagree. This isn't the only reason why people get violent, but it is one common reason.

Just like there didn't used to be democracy but monarchy, and people theorised about how democracy would be better even though it had never happened; now people are theorising that anarchy would be even better than democracy, like democracy v2.0. Then finally, enough people believed in the idea of democracy, and then they achieved it. Same goes with constitutional republics, there was a time when there had never been a such thing as that either, but people used their minds to imagine how it could work, and then did it.
Same deal with aeroplanes, there had never been aeroplanes but people theorised about them, and then it happened.
There are lots of other ideas about what alternatives would be better than the current democracies, but I think voluntaryism is the best. I don't specifically advocate anarcho-capitalism, rather an alternative and compatible form of voluntaryism/anarchy, but on reddit, would be the best subreddit to go to for what I support; most anarcho-capitalists are voluntaryists.
Voluntaryism is the idea of the Non-Aggression Principle (don't initiate force against people), combined with some system of property rights allocation which is the same for everyone. Anarcho-capitalism has one particular system of property rights allocation; some (few) anarcho-communists and some anarcho-socialists/left-libertarians are also voluntaryists, but I don't think their property rights systems are the best either. The one I advocate is most similar to anarcho-capitalism, but based on use of specific properties of specific resources.
My preferred form of anarchy can be encapsulated simply as Non-aggression, when that is defined as:
"Not bringing rivalrous resources into conflict." I think it might take a lot of knowledge to understand why with that definition, the non-aggression principle can be the root-foundation for an entire social system without needing to separately define the property-rights, so it might not mean much to you.
 is a good read, including the comments.
Also this guy has made a good summary of the system I advocate, it's a little more verbose than the definition I shared earlier (which might be good if you didn't understand that):

I also think arguing can be very productive; some ways are more so than others though. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
It wouldn't require that everyone abide by the set of morals voluntarily. Not even most people have to do it voluntarily. It seems you skipped over some of my points in my last post regarding incentives. Take taxation for example, whilst some people pay it voluntarily, perhaps most people don't want to pay taxes, but most people do want everyone else to pay taxes, so they support taxation even though they don't want to pay it themselves. And because most people support taxation, it is effectively enforced, and so even the people -- which is likely most people -- who would rather not pay taxes, end up paying them anyway because of the incentive created by the threats associated with not paying. It's not only the threat of violence -- of being locked up -- but also the threat of being verbally attacked in news-papers, shunned socially by society for being a tax-dodger, etc...
And I think, not stealing from people, not assaulting people, etc, would be much more supported and voluntarily abided by than taxation is now, in a society where people had already first decided that they wanted to use the NAP for government.
Computers can't follow protocols unless they are taught. You have to install the software for the protocols onto the computer in the first place, like you have to teach a protocol to a human. I'm not sure why you think it is so different: as I see it, it is very similar. Are you a 'computer scientist' (of any kind)? There are many situations in which people follow protocols, it could be a principle one follows consciously and or a habit one follows subconsciously.

I'm a voluntaryist, not an anarcho-capitalist. I think Voluntaryism is a better foundation than either.
Voluntaryism is based on the Non-Aggression Principle, where Non-Aggression is: "Not bringing rivalrous resources (including human bodies) into physical conflict". What this means is, that a person cannot own a river, he can only have the right to use the river in a certain way, and he can only acquire that right if it does not interfere with the way someone else was already using the river. So that means he either has to use a river that no one else is using; use it in a way which doesn't stop anyone else using it in the ways they have rights to (e.g. if people are drinking from it, you can't dump waste into it); or to purchase the rights off of all the people who were using the river before him; or a combination of these as necessary for his needs (as judged by him).
So, this problem of people getting blocked off from resources doesn't happen. If someone builds a house or a factory, the rights work the same way, but in this case it is practically the same as ownership, because there's not really any way someone else can use your house or factory without interfering with your use of it. The land underneath either, you could only have built your house on if it wasn't interfering with someone else's prior use of that land, or if it would've, you paid them off so no one loses out (indeed, everyone is made better off, at least by their own judgment at the time of transacting).
A large proportion, perhaps most, anarcho-capitalists are also voluntaryists, whereas only very few anarcho-communists are voluntaryists; ancaps and voluntaryists even share the same flag (yellow and black, though they may use a different emblem atop it). People could easily live communistically as voluntaryists; even easier than they could under pure anarcho-capitalism (i.e. lockean homesteading, exclusive land-ownership), which is very similar to voluntaryism anyway. In voluntaryism, communism or capitalism is only a lifestyle choice, not a political faction.

You're right sir, that it is involuntary and thus not libertarian.
The point being made, is that saying that it is awkward for libertarians that KYC/AML was responsible for catching a thief, when it was the government which forced companies to comply with KYC/AML, is like saying it's awkward for libertarians that roads improve the efficiency of wheeled transport vs mud-tracks/game-trails, simply because it is the government which currently pays contractors to build the roads.
Yes, both roads and regulation are important, and this is why they would be provided in a free market. I see no reason to think that the government would be any better at providing regulation, relatively, than it has been at providing food, clothing, or any other thing which we (depending on where we're from) currently enjoy a *relatively* free-market in, but which has in the past in various times and places been taken over by the government.

* The ledger of money is fantastic, but is corrupted by theft.
* When someone steals money, he changes the ledger to make it appear as though he has rendered value when he has not.

If a protocol-running person interacted with a non-protocol running person, then either the nodes would make calculations, and one would decide that it could not win, and would temporarily follow the dominant protocol in order to get along smoothly, or there would be conflict. It's also possible for a node to use a persuasion attack, and cause another node to copy the first node's protocol and install it on itself, overwriting its previous protocol.
Arbitrators, investigators and enforcers would be selected by the individual users running the protocol; they would trawl data from the internet, and use their neural networks to calculate which arbitrators/investigators/enforcers would provide the best benefit-cost ratio. At first the Arbitrators/investigators/enforcers (AIE) would most likely be other users running the protocol; over time their services could potentially be more and more automated.

You've lost me on the second paragraph. =D Care to restate?
I think, bottom layer, NAP is good, running on human brains. On-top of that, you have distributed software to record who has what rights to what properties of what resources, so that people can actually apply the NAP accurately (i.e. Jim has the right to use this structure as a house; Jeremy has the right to host his football club in that field from 10am-12pm every other Sunday from April-September, etc..); different protocols can be in operation in different locales. Then on top of that layer, you have free-market arbitrators &amp; investigators to resolve disputes and minimise conflicts over resources, basically to add the human element to the property-rights registration software, where the software falls short. Then on top of that, you have enforcement, to protect people's rights through force if it comes to that -- if all other measures have failed; enforcement is expensive, unpleasant, and can have blow-back ramifications, so all efforts should be made to minimise the need for it. You also have the insurance companies, who insure people against damages resulting from violations of the NAP; they work with the arbiters, enforcement, and also within communities to help prevent conflicts from arising in the first place (e.g. offering courses on how to get on well with other people, how to negotiate win-win outcomes, how to use the property-rights software properly, etc..), in order to minimise the amount they have to pay out on claims, increase good-will/reputation, and minimise their fees so they can win out against the competition for subscribers.

"Is it possible a group of people could come together and create a decentralized state? When is the last time a new nation was formed without a revolution?"
To create a decentralised 'state', what we need to do is come up with a law protocol that everyone can run in their heads, and use it as a basis for interacting with each other. So, it needs to be thorough enough to support a functioning society, but simple enough that not only highly specialised lawyers can comprehend it: it needs to be concise. A way we might do this, is by thinking about what kinds of interactions are beneficial in society, and what kinds of actions are harmful, and then trying to derive a universal principle or set of principles which distinguish these good and bad actions from each other on a fundamental level.
Once we have this protocol running on enough human brains, to determine what is legal and what is illegal according to the protocol, we can start to build up infrastructure around it. The more people use this protocol and the longer it's around, the better the infrastructure will get; but it would all be built around this underlying protocol.
An example principle is 'The Non Aggression Principle'. This principle used to only work as a complete protocol for human interactions when combined with an additional protocol for property rights (in a 'Human Interaction Protocol Suite'), as the original 'NAP' was defined as 'not initiating force against other people'. Therefore it was quite complex and not easy enough for the average person to run without getting fatal errors, and different client versions would not work together, e.g. when the protocol suite featured different property rights protocols. So, whilst this was a good principle for direct interpersonal interactions, when considered alone it fell apart when determining how humans should interact with non-human resources: as if I take your car, I didn't actually initiate force against you, though this would in most cases be problematic. The principle is being actively developed however, and NAP v 1.0 has recently been released as a stand-alone protocol, with the following algorithm: "Non aggression is, not bringing rivalrous resources (including human bodies) into physical conflict." You need to install the relevant libraries for the English language in your brain in order to process the commands, before you will be able to run this algorithm properly; if you don't have the right libraries installed already. You can download the libraries from Wikipedia, e.g. the 'rivalry' library which is found here: 
This algorithm is now capable of supporting decentralised government; the more people adopt it, the more impact it will have.

And maybe use an old low definition web-cam to scan a QR code to send the unsigned/signed transaction between the secure offline computer and the insecure online computer. So you don't have to connect USB or something. Also, disconnect the webcam when you're not using it and don't let it see anything except the QR code. QR codes don't contain enough data to carry malware I don't think.

I think the mining difficulty started several magnitudes harder than it did with Bitcoin, not sure on the scaling though... By the time most people heard about BTC it was already too hard for them to mine. The only thing with Quark is that they set so that all the coins would be produced in 6 months. This is not pre-mine, they announced this fact. The only thing that matters is how distributed the coins are: whether that happened through a wide base of mining or through trade doesn't matter. I don't know how distributed the coins are in Quark.

Government regulations which prevent competition with the brick &amp; mortar corporatists -- creating wealth concentration -- would not cease to exist either, though it may be easier for the wilful to circumvent it on a small scale.
I think however that regulations on internet-based businesses would take a big hit, reducing wealth-concentration in that arena.

What kind of dispute did you open? He already got me to open up an "I have a problem with an item I purchased" dispute, and then close it, so as I wouldn't be able to reclaim my payment -- the justification being of course that otherwise I would be able to /scam him/, this is why most BTC sellers don't accept PayPal.
The only other dispute option left open to me is the "I want to report a transaction that I didn't authorise" dispute, did you use this one or the former?

PayPal could hold Bitcoin in escrow for 2 weeks to give the buyer a chance to complain.

Fiat has downside stability, Bitcoin has upsides volatility. Historically all commodities have high upside volatility as they are in the process of becoming money. 
Customers are advantaged using Bitcoin to pay for goods/services if the business passes on the savings from not paying credit-card fees to the customer.

Freicoin is hot-potato currency, the incentive is to spend it as fast as you can. This means buying loads of consumer goods you don't need rather than saving/investing in capital goods which would increase societal wealth.

Why have the number of jobs increased alongside the amount of automation hmm? When the only automation was spears there was a population &lt;10,000. If you want to create jobs just get rid of lorries so people have to carry all the goods on their backs, right? Or maybe that would make those goods more expensive and people would have less money to spend on investment/entertainment/technology and all those people would lose their jobs. Maybe read 'Economics in One Lesson', the PDF is available for free online.

Bitcoin would redistribute wealth over time based on productivity, so it would not be a problem. The reason there is such a concentration of wealth now is because it is perpetually siphoned off through taxation -- a portion of which is paid to private banks in the form of Q.E. (and of course bail outs) -- and interest-bearing credit-issuance by private banks.
Anyway I'd rather a load of libertarians (temporarily) held a larger portion of the world's wealth than a load of politically connected corporatists.

Private banks can't issue bitcoin as credit, so that aspect would cease to exist; taxation would not cease to exist (for a long time at least), but it's possible the rate would be gradually reduced -- to incentivise payment of taxes -- as it became easier to avoid it.

What I did was moronic, but that doesn't make me a moron. If Bill Gates can't hit a baseball(no idea if he can or not) that wouldn't make him a moron; nor if Roger Federer couldn't do calculus. People have their weaknesses, and their moments of weakness. Being conned wasn't something I had been prepared for through past experiences, so I was not skilled at preventing it. Many people didn't prepare appropriately to prevent hacking, I saw their tragedy stories and that inspired me to get prepared, I never saw any con stories. If I hadn't seen the hacking stories I wouldn't have been so prepared for that, that wouldn't make me a moron.

Yeah, but that's the whole reason why most Bitcoin sellers don't accept PayPal, so this guy got me to open a dispute and then close it so I couldn't charge-back. I found that reasonable, seeing as it's effectively the same as if I'd used 'OKPay' etc where one can't chargeback in the first place. The guy had bots/accomplices vouching for him telling me he was legit remember, bots with whom I even shared mutual friends...

I appreciate your condolences, but as for my story's authenticity, my post includes screenshots... Is it bad to welcome donations in such circumstances?

The possibility of getting donations upon completion of this article is kind of what's been keeping me going since the con...

I am responsible for not taking more care to prevent myself getting robbed, but the scammer is responsible for robbing me. The only way I would deserve to get conned is if I had harmed someone else and they were taking the conned money as restitution. I haven't harmed anyone, there is no justice here.

Just don't do anything risky... For the reasons you describe, I ended up trying to do business 1on1 with someone who was advertising selling BTC on Facebook and I ended up getting conned out of $2400. They have fake Bitcoin groups filled with 100s of fake puppet accounts with realistic profiles and posting habits who will all vouch for them. It's best to either just suck it up and pay the extra fees to do bank transfer on localbitcoins etc, or to just wait.
