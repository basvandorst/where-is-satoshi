Thanks for that reply. That makes alot of sense. I'm still learning here so I didn't quite understand that's how it works.

Never purchased a single bitcoin yet so these prices just keep looking better and better ;)

I think Bitcoin prices will crash but that does not mean the end of bitcoin. It's obviously not like the Tulip Mania. The bitcoin network holds value. $5 Billion market cap at current prices is a bit hefty. I'd say fair value for Bitcoins assets are about $1 Billion. The market may toss up some cheaper valuations in the $350 to $700 million range. Around those levels it may be a good starting investment. I see bitcoin as a share or equity in the processing network. It's difficult to project out future cash flows on such an asset.

Hey BashCo. Haven't actually tried purchasing bitcoin anywhere. I'm leaning towards localbitcoins.com for my first purchase. Thanks for coinbase suggestion

Can someone changetip me some bits so I can see how this transfer between addresses work? Sorry for the crap post. Also, a fall in the price today is welcomed because I'd want to grab some Bitcoin at cheaper levels
@_date: 2014-09-27 06:29:25
This is a great thread. Thanks

If BTC-e falls below $370 things could get interesting. Also, I'm surprised by amount of bearishness towards bitcoin on this post. I would of thought more people would have been optimistic.

don't think you received my tip 100 bits cheers

Question. I'm in America. Someone else is in Indonesia. American with a bitcoin address sends bitcoins to an Indonesian with a bitcoin address. Technically the bitcoin didn't go from America to Indonesia. The transacation occurs at the blockchain. So where is the blockchain located? Hopefully I'm wording this right :/

Hello all. I'm new to bitcoin as well. I've been reading this thread and its been very helpful for me in understanding bitcoin in depth. I actually don't own a single bit as of yet but still curious about how bitcoin works. I just downloaded Mycelium. Hopefully I can learn to at least send and receive bitcoin. That would be a good first step. I'm a big believer in bitcoin after reading about it. I'm under the impression the peer-to-peer network is larger then all super computers combined!? If so, Bitcoins network is very valuable at its potential ability to process a vast amount of transactions globally for cheap is a unique proposition. Thanks again for the info on this thread. I'd tip someone if I had some bitcoin. Cheers
@_date: 2014-09-22 22:40:46
Thanks everyone. I found someone and sent a few mBTC. All I can say is amazing! The Bitcoin network is truly remarkable. Can send money to someone across the globe for pennies with no middleman.
@_date: 2014-09-23 00:24:41
Why thanks good sir. I think I'll pass on your tip to another foreign bitcoin address. Cheers!

The big question is how do you value bitcoin? Here's my opinion:
An actual Bitcoin can be seen as a equity share in the Peer-to Peer Network. Each share or Bitcoin gives you equity in the Networks processing power. The change in value of Bitcoin is a reflection of the markets valuation of the network. I'm under the impression that Bitcoins network is larger than all the supercomputers in the world combined. This networks ability to process payments globally for a fraction of the cost of competitors offers some unique value. I'm sure its much more complicated than this but this is my general understanding. The current market capitalization of Bitcoin is just over $5 Billion. Visa &amp; Mastercard have what I believe to be inferior payment systems and the market cap for these companies is over $60 Billion. You can start to see the value. Just my opinion.

Here's my opinion my friend. Take that 10k and put it in a safer less speculative assest like us treasury or money market account. Use the interest u get to buy bitcoin every month. I cant agree with you about taking $ on loan to buy bitcoin. Dont do it. Just my opinion and best of luck to you

So will coinbase now offer futures contracts for hedging purposes? If not, that be a bummer. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:32:09


Your bitcoin is on the way. Please reply confirmed when it has been received so the next address can be posted ;)

Not selling but waiting to buy. I think bitcoin will hit $80 possibly by year end or first quarter of 2015. If I was holding bitcoin right now I would sell no doubt.
