Duly noted, will put my bitcoin-buying socks on.

Im very surprised that this site isnt more popular/mainstream!
I assume everyone who is putting in their wallet address is going to be dissapointed.

Im no economist or anything but I see a stabilization in mining as a good thing for us.

Maybe we could request a bitcoin deposit method for Acorns...? Coinbase already supports recurring payments, it would be easy for the customer.

Microsoft has accepted it as a payment system. This does not mean the company actively holds a bitcoin balance, aka adopting.

Whoah, whoah, whoah, that's *estimated* to be 289 days. Tbh it's more likely you will lose it forever if you try this method.
and still, that is almost a **year**

Very informative. Have invested in a shovel, time capsule, safe, an isolated plot of land in western Greenland, several land mines, steel anodizing equipment, space grade insulation, and then tattooed the second half of my private key among my 256 closest friends' left butt cheeks in alphabetical order by their mother's maiden names. Most were willing to do so for $500 each, no questions asked.
Nicholas Cage, come at me.

That is a weird assertion considering they claim no service fee nor exchange fee. The gap between buy and sell isn't a fee, that's a market's standard gap.
Unless you are saying they modify the gap to turn a profit, that I would believe...

Sorry for bad english

Okay, makes sense.
Thanks :)

They "decide" the market rates, but other than that there is only the miner fee. (Decide meaning they go with the market but nothing actually ties them to it.)
Under the fees section:
With ShapeShift, what you see is what you get. The exchange rate shown is exactly what you'll receive, minus only the "miner fee."
There is no exchange fee, or service fee.
Look at the page to see the fee breakdown per coin.
