Dogecoin could get 5,000 signatures. Such wow. Very much.

Every time I see a thread like this I am perturbed how much people pleading to Coinbase resemble little kids asking their parents with tears in their eyes to buy them a new toy.

Looking at the Stone Age like operation of MUFG, you probably have to fax in your buy orders

This guy clearly doesn't understand Bitcoin or it's protocol design. It's not like Fiat currency where it'll just pop in value down to $0.00, simply doesn't work like that. This guy clearly spreading FUD, even if Bitcoin's value crashes from it's currently value all the way down to what it was a year ago, the alt coins will surely take over Bitcoin's value and still be worth a lot more.

way to go Niehash. Anything that helps shed good token on Bitcoin and other Cryptos is great. Thank you for stepping up and doing the right thing.

I was reading a thread on Bitcoin talk where a guy was talking about how he sold his 15,000 BTC for about $0.003 in 2010.

I'm not sure newbies could handle a 2 year downtrend to be fair

Could this be a hedge? rather than speculative

It’s it’s only use at the moment. Can’t spend it like cash, that’s for sure

Roger you need some acting classes.﻿

I agree. I think the fact we only went down this much (and not way more) in the face of so much bad news, fud and scandal this past month is a bullish sign for the long game.
