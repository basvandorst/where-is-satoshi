Believe me, you need that dollar way more than I do. Do me a favor, choose someone random here and send them a dollar in Bitcoin, let me know how that works out.

Do not disrespect the code that reflects Satoshi’s road map. If a kid code have coded it, that’s one genius kid because Bitcoin Cash is exactly what you read on the white paper. Have some fucking sympathy for people who can’t afford to pay super high fees! They are misled into getting into crypto by watching outdated YouTube videos and reading the white paper then find out that they’ve been lied to. Now that Coinbase added Bitcoin Cash to the equation, people have a chance to be economically free. You guys are incredibly selfish. What about the Bitcoin ATM’s that are losing so much money? Don’t you think they will soon use Bitcoin Cash instead? We’re working on it. Just go over to the sub and see how many of us are working very hard. LN will not be tolerated and if you sold your BITCOIN CASH, you’re stupid. You’ll regret it soon.

No, it’s because you were dumb from the beginning. You have no knowledge on the satoshi white paper nor do you care for people who can’t afford to pay $40 to send there buddy $5 in Bitcoin. That’s not what satoshi wanted. Go get some BCH and tell me how you like it.

Get this stupid post out of here. You’re a hater! Stop trying to bring a successful company down because you’re a failure. It will never work. Coinbase is here to stay. Cashening ✅✅✅������☘️☘️☘️

Why the fuck did I get downvotes. I asked a fucking valid question! Fuck r/bitcoin bunch of scammers from Blockstream. Can’t fucking answer the question because it’s the truth. Sad! Stop scamming people! You idiots want to involve authority towards Coinbase, did you fucking morons forget that this is a decentralized ecosystem. Fuck you and the gov’t. Coinbase are hero’s. They saved tons of people from being scammed by the fake Bitcoin that doesn’t follow Satoshi’s instructions on increasing block sizes. Nobody will ever use bitcoin once banks or centralized systems get involved. Don’t you see how many people are flocking to the better solution which is Bitcoin Cash and only Bitcoin Cash? Open your fucking eyes!!!

Send your buddy $5 in Bitcoin to get a beer. Come back and tell me how that works out. You’re going to need $45 for a $5 beer. Your buddy will be upset with you.

The Chinese clone of bitcoin? The creator of bitcoin is fucking Asian! Satoshi Nakamoto! Most of the fucking Bitcoin you’re using has been mined in Asia! Satoshi white paper clearly reflects Bitcoin Cash and not bitcoin. Try this, send your buddy $2 for a beer in Bitcoin and then Send him $2 in Bitcoin Cash....Come back and tell me which one works out. Tell me which one resembles Satoshi’s vision for p2p transactions.

LN will not be tolerated. No centralized systems will benefit or intervene with Satoshi’s vision. Stick to the white paper!

What gov’t? �������������� 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:54:02
People will use it. It’s a real cash system. Now you guys have a currency that’s spendable. No excuses to buy things now. Bitcoin Cash will never crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:36:48
No one wants to hold bitcoin. There’s no point. I can’t use it. I am not invested in a currency that our people can’t use. No way.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:06:42
Believe me, no one s confused. People are happy with Bitcoin Cash. Nobody wants to use a currency that doesn’t cost a penny to transact. How much will it cost me to send $2 to my buddy for a beer? Will it cost me $30 bucks just to send my buddy $2 Who wants that? Did satoshi want that? No! That’s why he gave instructions on how to increase the block sizes. He didn’t give instructions on how to create light net to help banks profit. Fuck banks and fuck the gov’t it’s not happening! We commend Coinbase for their brave move!
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:44:02
Stop spreading misinformation. Most people were waiting for Bitcoin Cash! 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:51:06
Then send them $5.01 in Bitcoin Cash. They’ll have $5. You can send for under a penny. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:59:59
Watch your fucking mouth! It’s Bitcoin Cash!!! Get it right!
