I wouldn't trust anything out of Washington DC preceded by a foul stench. It isn't kosher.

All governments should stay out of people's business. What one does with their hard-earned money is no one's business but their own. Governments are but a collection of inferior busy-bodies who validate their existence by looking into windows not theirs.

As was outlined in the PNAC Accord (Project for New American Century) ... first to be invaded (1) Iraq, (2) Libya, (3) Syria, (4) Iraq, (5) and finally USA's allied Saudi Arabia. Well, I guess the NWO is pushing toward that area now.

Thank you for your contribution on Bitsquare. It was nice of you to take the time out for some of us.

It's one of the many battles against privacy being assaulted by U.S. government on its citizens. But one day down the road citizens will rise up, and not unlike a dog shaking fleas from its back, will do the same with these parasitic entities embedded within our societies.

Trezor is a safety deposit box in itself. If Trezor hardware wallet is lost or stolen you can still get your bitcoins with another Trezor by putting in the correct word seeds.

I think with Coinbase that is the initial frustration. However, I found afterward that my purchasing limit was indeed raise once time has satisfied them for whatever reason. I have no problem purchasing 10 bitcoins at all at present time.

All politicians by the very nature of becoming one should be made aware of. They serve no purpose at all. And are or will be detrimental to the rise of Bitcoin if they can help it. However because of their ineptitude they  will be shown floundering and redundant in their outmoded posturing.

Quite insightful ... great report ... I do hope however the Washington DC input is wrong, as I see absolutely nothing anabolic coming out of that foul region. Also, too, much credence is given to their intelligentsia, which often times reveals as much brilliance as does a dim light bulb. But kudos to your thought-provoking essay. Love it.

Everytime this 'fraudulent clown' opens his mouth via  teleprompter makes me want to mentally puke.

How about a KeepKey? If Tezor doesn't have an Intel CPU I am assuming (rather hoping) KeepKey doesn't have one too.

Brilliant presentation. Thank you Neha for such an insightful, historic, and hopeful talk on Bitcoin.

Homeland ... another page taken from the Third Reich in this fast insidious growth of the Fourth Reich in the USA. Homeland Security is the new kid on the block, another police state within itself, that should by now be abolish. Now they're trying to fuck with our investments and payment systems. Who the hell are they to think themselves some militaristic god formed by Bush/Cheney? It's nigh time for them to be abolish. Period.

Coinbase ... I wonder are you on top or bottom in bed with FBI? 
@_date: 2016-09-04 13:44:37
Trezor by far.

First 5 minutes of it was all that could be tolerated. " ... bitcoin should be regulated by the U.S. government etc. etc." What a shithead.

How about Amazon? Authorized too?

Capitalism has failed. In 2008. With the bank bail-out. "Too big to fail." Remember that nice slogan? 2008 saw the death of capitalism. There's no more capitalism in this country. There's 'Corporatism.'

This Orwellian government is getting worse than totalitarianism and communism. What's next? Removal of Venetian blinds from windows because one might be hiding something. Not only is this government tiring but so, too, the endless buzzword of  terrorism. We all know its fabricated and perpetuated by the very monsters in government that created it. 2017 is going to be a real mess. Personally, I know that this government has gotten too big (unconstitutionally) for its breeches. It should be marginalized or abolished. There's really no need for them.

They're not educated, per se. They are just good at their provincial profession. Doesn't make them educated at all. Just look at Washington DC.

I've noticed how players from the United States are emphatically 'not allowed.' I thought bitcoin was global.

'Monkey see, monkey do.' Whatever US government does, the UK and Australian govt is sure to mimic in the days ahead.

Haven't these assholes anything better to do with their anointed positions? The so-called 'government' is getting to be more of a humorless joke these days, what with high-crimes being committed in political and financial areas that both threaten the economy and stability of American citizens.

The 'un-Illuminati' is what they truly are; not the Illuminati. Nothing illuminating about them at all. Illumination is an attained state of spiritual consciousness; i.e. Buddha. These 'maggots' are nurtured in darkness.

Thanks, Andreas, for your contribution to a new society of thought and finance, which I hope will manifest worldwide quite soon. The status-quo has long outlived itself. It's time it was shrugged, dismissed, and abolished from our lives. There's a future ahead. A future of our own making.

Exact sentiments. We're like school children deferring to hall monitors for passage to the boy's room.

Traditionally during the down-stretch of presidential races all things come to a vague and uncertain stand-still. Then the sh*t unfolds in the aftermath ....

Last I read was MIT is working with FBI in tracking and identifying users in the blockchain. 'Riffle' just might be another 'mousetrap' set into motion. Why should anyone trust them?
