The "X" prefix is specifically for supranational commodities.

I hate to break it to you, but DarkSend bloats. At its base, what it does is break up a transaction into components (more outputs: bloat) and send it over and over again between masternodes (more transactions: bloat). Intuitively, you can think of DarkSend as turning one transaction into many sub-transactions. Obviously the resulting size must be proportionally larger.
Of course, you could cut it down by relying on a single masternode to mix, but then it's not trustless. Given that ring signatures are trustless with a single transaction, they probably bloat *less*.

Thanks! I've asked the dev about the coin's plans for blind signing.

Uh, where's your math? They're both linear with the number of outputs/public keys/cascading stages. I would expect something on the order of the same size. Show me how this is not the case?

From my reading of the DarkCoin beta's implementation, it's already decentralized. It's also different from CoinJoin in that it pools exactly the same amount from multiple senders (greater than all their intended send amounts) and then returns the appropriate change amounts to new addresses. This removes restrictions on an amount's granularity and also makes it more difficult (impossible?) to reconstruct the sender-receiver map.
Can you clear up how it isn't decentralized? You stated:


What's the source and who is "someone"? I haven't used this coin's feature (sadly they didn't release an OSX beta wallet), but I presume you have.
I'm also interested in this WIP BitCoin implementation. The project you linked to ( appears dead -- last updated 7 months ago on github. Looks like this one took the bounty and ran. Could you link to an alive project? Thanks.

FYI, the dev's response:

Given that it's a linear relationship with a constant on the order of 1 or 10, if CryptoNote has this 'problem', so must BTC.
Conversely, the same solution is applicable to both. Currently that solution is tx fees, and it seems to work (well enough that you don't think BTC even has this problem).
Incidentally, DarkCoin also bloats from all the transaction amount breakdowns and the multiple stages of mixing needed to negate bad actors. Every transaction becomes many sub-transactions in order to achieve the end result.

Nothing in particular. Its primary use is speculation currently so the price is prone to large swings -- sometimes instant, sometimes in slow motion.
