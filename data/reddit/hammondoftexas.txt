Classic bitcoin.

In Switzerland it's treated like money and you're only subject to wealth taxes if you have enough. But no taxes on gains.

Switzerland -&gt; coinbase, most probably other exchanges which are often mentioned here, SBB Ticketing machines (railway ticketing machines)
@_date: 2019-07-30 13:42:03
Me too. Swissquote?
@_date: 2019-07-10 08:06:15
That's my bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-07-29 11:54:59
My bank.
@_date: 2019-07-10 08:55:00
I FOMO in a couple of hundred bucks every week because I'm so  ready.
@_date: 2019-07-16 07:59:08
My Swiss investment bank allows me to invest directly in cryptos and I can buy bitcoin at every railway station.

When we hit 100k you'll regret that you didn't buy now.
@_date: 2019-07-03 07:30:17
I bought 0.73 through coinbase and have 0.5 on my investment bank so I don't have technically one in one piece.
@_date: 2019-07-24 08:41:21
First, you should only invest what you can afford to lose. Nobody can predict the future. Second, no, it's not too late. Just yesterday I invested a couple of thousands more because I expect bitcoin to go significantly higher in the next few years.
@_date: 2019-07-30 08:19:27
At my bank.
@_date: 2019-07-16 08:05:32
There are no anonymous accounts and e.g. Americans can't have a Swiss bank account at all.
@_date: 2019-07-31 10:57:56
Well, a former national council of Switzerland said he wanted to make Switzerland a crypto country.

Swiss banks are more and more getting into bitcoins. My bank already offers a bitcoin account, that's where I have my bitcoins. Easiest way to buy and withdrawal bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-07-26 08:04:30
Meanwhile, my bank offers a bitcoin account and I can trade bitcoins with them.
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:12:16


Like my fiat and my stocks. But I trust them more with not losing it.

Facebook: "Libra will be good to help poor countries with terrible infrastructure"
Also facebook: "In fact, a Facebook spokesperson told CoinDesk that the social media giant has no plans to make Calibra wallet accessible to the island nation due to U.S. sanctions."

I don't understand what you're trying to say or how it is relevant to my post.
@_date: 2015-06-20 19:06:17
So what's your suggestion, how to convert real-life money, which we people usually earn, into bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:10:35
Buying and charging gift credit cards first also looks very complicated. I hope 247exchange will work well (I'm still not done with the verification process). All I want to do is buying bitcoins in a comfortable way.
@_date: 2019-08-27 06:43:03
KYC has nothing to do with banking secret. Banking secret is still alive for Swiss customers.
@_date: 2019-08-27 06:21:58
The investment bank swissquote already offers cryptos.
@_date: 2019-08-06 09:13:11
I will cash out at ATH. The hard part is to pinpoint the ATH.

Yes, they share it with other counties, but they don't share it with Swiss tax authorities, even in the case of tax evasion.

One former national council member said he wants to make Switzerland a "crypto country".
@_date: 2019-08-27 07:26:48
Yes, with other counties, but not for Swiss citizens. There are only [few exceptions](
@_date: 2019-08-27 06:20:41
How so? The gov can't know how many money we have. That's what the Swiss banking secret is for.
@_date: 2019-08-27 08:05:24
Only in the case of tax fraud they are allowed to check the banking information.
@_date: 2019-08-26 07:23:48
In many countries you don't have to pay takes on capital gains.
