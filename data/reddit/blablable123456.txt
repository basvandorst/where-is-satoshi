Bubble/crash? If it was, it would already have crashed with this 12Bi marketcap "out of nothing". Good luck with your "gambling".

Most of the people here are sadly doing it, hardly you will see anyone using it for buying or exchanging for something. They think they can get rich from a day to another.

Oh really? Because every single one Ive found wanted to get rich quick and this has nothing to do with politics. And if you dont mind, I didnt understand your last statemant
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:12:07
Lots of banks now started closing bitcoin exchange accounts here because they said "We don't have interest on them, they might contain laundry money". Every Bank says the same thing "They use it to launder money". Sure, because nobody can launder money via fiat.. sure.

Nice way of misreading what he wrote. Mobile wallets are not 100% secure If the user keep using It along side with other stuff.

Hahahahahahah, of course he didnt. He only wrote "Mobile wallets = for managing small amount of btc". You made some stuff up and I did too, mr correct.

i was making a joke on roger ver. calm down boiiii

I think they already did that ^
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:33:55
How come? The mempool is having high times ( bitcoin is slowing developing its way to reach a high audience. Please do not think only "look the fees are high", the dev team takes huge time to implement something because it takes time maintaining a CURRENCY. It's a lot of peoples money on the way, its not as "look, a bug, let me do a workaround and it will be fixed". Go take a look at the github depository and you'll see a lot of the devs working everyday on the core.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:53:04
People seem to forget the whole point is that developing such thing is not "int a = b;" its too difficult to keep It going. People think programming is easy until they try. And i agree with you +1

I completely agree with you. Bitcoin was made to send money from A to B without anyone knowing who the sender was, not to hold and increase the value.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:47:24
Calm down, show the tx ID.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:55:10
Who said that bitcoin doesnt have a scalability problem? Bitcoin was first designed to transfer money without third parties, not for speculation, not for getting rich fast.

Glad that I wrote something so simple but you didnt get the idea. Good for you.

As always centralizing something that shouldnt. Hope they lose a lot of costumers with this BCash bandwagon.
"We are prioritizing security and performance over new features", yeah sure, giving space to BCash.

I get your point but comparing to Reddit wasnt the best example.

Did you even read what i wrote? What does the amounts of each desktop or mobile have to do with what i wrote?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:11:32
Bitpay uses a default fee of 200sat/b If the mempool is lower than 200. If its higher, they adjust It increasing even more. Bitpay is a horrible service
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:21:12
Shitpays universe. Terrible service (bitpay)

No tx id? Wow, thats some shady stuff. It shouldve
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:59:14
Actually he wrote only that mobile wallets are used to small amounts, because if you use the same phone for daily activities you could lose your phone or get stolen and you wont lose all your money, he never said that its insecure. About android and iOS being "super secury" go you do some research and see that out there are lots of malware for both of them. Mobile systems are not power rangers.

Bitpay uses a default fee of 200sat/b (in those man in the middle thing that they do), even when the mempool is cleaning 140sat/b or lower. This is my experience with Shitpay. I almost forgot, they don't allow you to set your own fees, only 4 type of "waiting time" fees.

@_date: 2017-11-22 10:04:28
Shitpay (Bitpay) have a default 200sat/b fee and now they are forcing 255sat/b without the need of it. I don't get why companies like valve use this piece of shit.
@_date: 2017-11-24 12:56:20
Wait a minute, you send only the amount to the address without the shitpays fee? Thats something I never thought about it, since I always thought that if my payment didnt process quickly enough I would lose those BTC. Did this ever happened to you? Thats something I never knew about, thanks for the answer.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:27:02
They use a default fee of 200sat/b, if the mempool is high in volume they will increase it, if its lower than 200, they will keep it as a default fee.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:24:55
Shitpay use a default fee of 200sat/b but recently theyve been using 255sat/b. I last checked it yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:57:45
Don't forget **Shitpay**
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:28:11
I still don't get your point, since Shitpay use a default 200sat/b fee. How come you did it? I would love to read it!.

You are a complete idiot. Nobody gives a fuck about USD when you live in fucking south america and tries to send money to someone in Russia with a fee of 0.3$ or recieving from Finland with a fee of 0.76$. Remember when a guy bought two pizzas with 10k BTC? So yeah, nobody gives a fuck about price when someone accepts it. YOU IDIOT.
