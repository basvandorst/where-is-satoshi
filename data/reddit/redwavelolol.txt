I'm literally paid for my thoughts on the economy and politics, and my ability to articulate them well, and you just spend too much time on reddit.

Hope you don't get hacked before HYPERBITCOINIZAAAAAATIIOOOOON
Would be a real shame if all of your perfect and totally not without any flaws magic new money was suddenly siphoned off by Korean hackers. 
And by shame, I mean the kind of thing I'd break out the popcorn for.
@_date: 2019-06-12 06:55:56
I mean, sure. But your belief is stupid and maybe even harmful.
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:44:30
You really don't understand that most hacking is accomplished through basic phishing scams and that the average person (for whom adoption is necessary to get to your HYPER!! BITCOIN!! I Z A T I O N!!!!! world)  has zero interest in managing their own security and that your grandma shouldn't be trusted with her own house keys much less her own private bitcoin keys, do you? 
You really don't understand that most people would rather do a credit card chargeback than lose their money forever, especially when entire accounts are involved, do you? 
But hey, you want me to pretend like no one has lost their keys/been robbed of their bitcoin/had an exchange hacked? Okay, cool. What other dumb nonsensical false shit would you like me to pretend to believe? 
Hey, keep throwing out names of obscure hash functions, it totally changes the fact that bitcoin is needlessly complex, in search of problems that don't exist, and is basically as stupid as you.
@_date: 2019-06-13 04:12:28
Yes, the deep state is your enemy, education is indoctrination, R1 associate professors of postmodern literary theory are THE MAN, and academia and the MSM are out to get you.
I've known about bitcoin since the early 2010's. I understand it fine. I just think it's stupid. (And so are you.)
@_date: 2019-06-12 07:15:08


Yes, I am not a neckbeard that lives in my mom's basement. 


LMFAO, dude, you're on a crypto forum shilling bitcoins. Has there ever been anything more rent-seeking than bitcoin? You're either a rent-seeking parasitic early adopter getting rich off of other people... or you're the fool that got in late handing over your dollars to rent-seeking "whales." 
This whole sub is literally people that want to get rich by "flipping" bitcoin. Do you even know what rent-seeking means?
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:06:56


Also, this betrays your own persecution complex. I don't "dislike" bitcoin. I just recognize it as a stupid curiosity that took off due to the ability to use it to buy drugs online (it's only proven use case outside of money laundering, ransomware, and other illegal activities), blew up due to speculation, and has morphed into a massive unintentional ponzi scheme. 
You are wrong, but very deluded, and very invested in what you have staked much of your identity and perhaps much of your financial worth upon. There's nothing I can say that will get you people to pull your heads out of each other's asses, so all i can say is, Hope you got in on this ponzi scheme early. 
(I don't really hope that though, you're kind of a turd and i like it when you people lose your money, i only wish it were possible for you all to lose your money, though the nature of ponzi schemes is that the first in and out take money from the bagholders... such is the nature of zero sum games, which crypto mostly is)

Okay, whatever you say, Tyler Durden. The fact that these subs are all about lambo memes betrays that reading, but whatever. I will wait until this process, which you have just coined in this very important Reddit thread, happens. 
When you say it by decree like that, it really makes it sound INEVITABLE. So I'm sure it's only a matter of time now. I'm super excited about transferring my 401K to you so that I can buy some $1 billion dollar bitcoins. I can't imagine why I might hesitate to do so...
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:19:58
Socialism will win, regardless of what you think. 
Does that help you see how this is not an argument and that you're a blowhard?
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:01:34
Yes, it is truly a tragedy I did not invest in pets.com. 
I have plenty of imagination. I just think your notion of the future is stupid and based on wishful thinking around getting rich for doing nothing. 
"completely naive about cryptography"
How so?
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:09:44


You sound quite confident. Want to give me a date and place a bet?
@_date: 2019-06-11 23:49:38
This is so deluded. 
It splits my side that some anonymous neckbeard can blather bad sci-fi made up shit based on nothing (while calling the financial model that helped build the modern world and has proven effective over centuries of rapidly changing human history) and get upvoted to the top, LMAO
But yes, I am sure everyone will jump on Bitcoin so that states, global economies, and all of humanity can transfer 95% of the world's wealth to dudes on this subreddit, because reasons
HYPER BITCOIN I F I C A T I O N
@_date: 2019-06-12 20:36:03
Okay, buddy. Taking that SUPER seriously. 
It's cool, because I'll just come bum a few bitcoins off you, as I suppose it won't be no big thing since the people already into bitcoin now will hold 90% of the world's wealth because they were the first to sign their names on a decentralized ledger decades before. Makes sense, seems like it'll totally happen.
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:03:13
You realize you sound like the wild-eyed homeless guy on my street corner trying to inform me that the end is nigh? 
You realize you sound like this to everyone that isn't also a Very Online ancap shitard?
@_date: 2019-06-13 04:14:36


I think you mean "the world as it actually exists"
@_date: 2019-06-12 07:04:24
It's quite clear that you don't care about anyone's opinion or greater knowledge and prefer to live in an imaginary world of make believe where you say stupid uninformed shit on boards full of stupid uniformed people.
But please, tell me more about this future crypto utopia where business owners and politicians abandon national currencies so that they can make you and people like you the richest men in the world for no fucking reason at all.

So dumb.
