It's a $300 device being sold for 10x that. Why would anybody want it?

* Do you use Google Chrome, Safari or Firefox as your browser? 
* Do you still have a computer available that has been logged in before? 
If both are true, I can run you through recovering your wallet without their help or the 2FA key.
* [Rip open the Developer Tools of your browser when on the My Wallet page of blockchain.info. Go to the "Local Storage" pane. ](
* Double click on "payload" and copy it to the clipboard. 
* Base64 decode it into a binary named "wallet.json.aes" (tell me your OS and I'll explain how).
* [Import into MultiBit using the default settings.](
* Send your funds to a brand new wallet.

Be prepared for a long, long wait. They typically ignore email requests. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 06:11:35
They just don't reply. Who knows why.

Alright. Safari. 
Try looking in here:
    ~/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/
Look for: 
    http_blockchain.info_0.localstorage
Failing that we can start looking through the deleted files on your drive to find the deleted localstorage.

I've made a few attempts with no reply after 3 months or so. I know other people here are waiting too. The creator is around on reddit every now and then under the name zootreeves.

Not a worry. Sorry I couldn't help further.

You found a `http_blockchain.info_0.localstorage`? 
Lets try one last time with it. 
Open a terminal window, type `sqlite3 ` (with a space on the end), drag in the .localstorage file, hit enter. At the prompt type `.dump` and enter, and scroll through looking for `INSERT INTO "ItemTable" VALUES('payload'`.
If that's there, we are gold.

Try using the method I suggested above.

Try Armory. One paper backup lasts for the life of the wallet, and there's a load of advanced coin control options. I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't use it myself.
