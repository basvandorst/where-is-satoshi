It's not a joke. It's a fair piece of land, the countries illegally and just immorally tried to stop him. If there is free land, then it is free, no exceptions. This is not his fault.

If you want war, by all means. I'm saying that bigger countries get to stomp on anyone and everyone even though it violates human rights and apparently no one feels the need to stop them. E.g. the US abuses all the smaller countries, the smaller countries abuse even smaller countries...

That's absolutely untrue. You don't know me or my accomplishments, I know what you have done and what you claim.
Don't come here just to lie.

How is that cringe? Other than the fact that it should be true but isn't.

Are you joking? She did nothing, much less anything better than anyone. You don't even know me or what I have done. But we know who she claims to be, and who she really is.
Is there anything else you would like to add?

It's like paying people to do something for you and then coming out and acting like those people never existed and saying "I DID THIS, ALL ME, I am the 16 year old prodigy, praise and pay me."
No, I'm not joking. I make a factual point, you return with apparent lies. The evidence doesn't exist? Did you just scroll past the post and comment immediately?

I'm 99% sure there's a lot more going on than just that.

We do? She just got a ton of rep and money on something very dishonest.

LOL, I doubt I'll find a better reason why we need BTC to turn around.
