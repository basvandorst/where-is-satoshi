Sorry but I don't want extra competition, I want to buy more coins at discount first
If they want to get in on it, they can do their own damn research

why not? a wallet that you can use on your phone without needing retailers, banks, or any 3rd party interaction.
money that's mobile, all you need is your phone and you don't need to carry around a garbage bag full of cash. 
money that's worldwide. If Madagascar closes its ports and survives you can then use bitcoin both in civilization and in the zombielands

You need recognition from other countries to be a real country, otherwise you might as well be petoria
And you always change trade deals once you get in power.
And banking is the one thing they don't have. They don't even have atms on the island.
And sure they can do that...but any other option will be even more inviting. 
Seriously if you want your own country that's really the best option by far.

I think it's only fair that Coinbase gets moderated on this subreddit until they stop being dicks. 
Their actions have shown to be toxic to the community(and since their service went to shit anyways, it's not like it'll be a big loss), so maybe it's time to push back.
Setup a filter that translates "Coinbase" to "********"
Remove them from the list of recommended places to buy bitcoins.
Then make a public ultimatum...Coinbase is blacklisted until the guy is no longer CEO of Coinbase and Coinbase issues a public apology. 
He can step down, or his board can remove him once the investors find out how he is fucking up. And if not, well they can always go peddle their shit to and those ETH pumping retards

I feel like that can be another source of attack...someone hacks the mytrezor site or hell they take hostages at the trezor HQ and make them change the code, then you connect and it downloads hacked software, and oops all your bitcoins were sent to the hacker. 
Trezor needs an option so it can be used without updates. Then if there is a major update, it should be initiated only by the user. 
So you can upgrade to stable version 1.0, 2.0, 3.0...each combed over with a fine toothed comb by the community. Instead of upgrading to 1.43854b-zinc-v3 release once a week

that's because you need a military to defend a country
doesn't matter if you have 100,000 bitcoiners or 100,000,000 bitcoiners. An enemy force can roll over them in days. The Iraq population in 2003 was 26 million people, and they had one of the biggest militaries in the world at that time...and they didn't last a month against an invasion. 
The point of bitcoin is that the country is there to buy legitimacy. You become an actual country and that means you can use diplomats to get what you want. You can get support of China, Russia etc....basically Bitcoinland can be like Switzerland or Israel...tiny nation that could be taken over in no time...yet with powerful connections that keep it protected.
And with a tiny population, you really don't have to worry about getting. Bad publicity. "Internet nerds use their fake money to create their own nation, and it's such a joke that we had to send the 5th fleet to take them over"
Overall it's pretty much a publicity stunt on a massive scale. A way to create a country where the default currency is bitcoin. Where the laws are friendly to bitcoin businesses. And which can have a diplomatic arm to advocate for bitcoin in other countries.

investing with bitcoin itself is one of the dumbest things you can do. 
the risk in no way justifies the reward, since the money can just disappear.
2-3-5...hell even 10% interest, is a pittance to take that risk. 
the value of bitcoin tends to increase with age all by itself. Just hold, and in that 1 year you'll get a bigger return than you would with any other stock
And if you really care about making an investment...start a business that offers services/products for bitcoin 
Greed is how suckers lose all their shit because they wanted to get an extra few % in interest

they are already have that though...they have a very tight relationship with New Zealand, so they mostly speak English.

Why not just take over one?
Example: 
A self-governing nation(so it's an actual country, not just an island). Their population is less than 1,500. It's pretty big for an island(100 square miles...or same size as 5x Manhattans). They have their own airport and a hospital and all the modern infrastructure. They already have their own trade deals and pacts...i.e. they all get a New Zealand dual citizenship. The country is bilingual and everyone speaks english. And the economy is fairly small(10 mil/yr gdp). They also rely heavily on foreign aid, and right now that's being phased out by $250K/yr(so they are hard up for cash). They also get their own top level domain(.nu). It's the first wifi nation. They also already laid down fiber. 
Pretty much it's perfect.
If they have a population of 1,500, you can literally just move 1500 Bitcoiners there and you'll have full control of the country. I dunno how you can get a citizenship, but I'd imagine there should be procedures in place. And since they are broke, you can probably just buy the citizenship for peanuts.
And if there aren't any procedures for that, I'm sure a few well placed donations to politicians, would get them to add that. 
Move there, then vote in our leadership, pass a bunch of pro-bitcoin laws, make bitcoin the national currency, then enjoy a life of leisure in a paradise. And it'll cost a fuck ton less than it would be just to buy an island that size, let alone develop all the infrastructure. And the price of bitcoin will go through the roof if an actual country makes it the national currency.
If this becomes a thing and people want to tip me for coming up with the idea...my address is: 16Xu72qPsJ7jGPy5pzLDPY4NHbeRFhyTHG
