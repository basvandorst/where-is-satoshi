This will kill btc. 
Anyone accepting it for goods and services right now is going to be completely fucked when this bubble pops.
I can see why steam dumped it.

If we had a free market where you could choose from a large number of ISPs, this would be fine. But we don't.
In most of the US, people are lucky if they can choose between two ISPs. And, the major ISPs have essentially written the laws at the state level to ensure that there is no new competition, only geographic monopolies and duopolies. 
Currently, the regulations that ensure that traffic is treated equally are the only way we have any sort of freedom in these monopolies. They can charge us what they want, but we can go wherever we please and use whatever service we want - that is, I can use Netflix or Bitcoin instead of Comcastflix or Comcastcoin because Comcast cannot currently block or throttle bitcoin and Netflix. They also can't force me to use their versions of services, or make me pay more to access Netflix or bitcoin. If net neutrality is rolled back, they will be able to.
Again, this would be fine in a free market because I could tell them to fuck off and then go find another ISP that offered a more open internet package. But, I can't do that. State laws heavily limit competition and municipal broadband - it's Comcast or nothing. 
What we end up with is very expensive, low quality internet service with no ability to "vote with our wallet." For example, in parts of Houston...one of the largest cities in the US...Comcast is the only ISP. 
If people want net neutrality removed then we need to have open competition as well so that the ISPs can't ride roughshod all over us.

Another ISP? One ISP counts as competition according the Fucking Consumers Commission.

It worked with the old dogecoin wallet - it showed incoming transactions anyway.

If there is a process where money can be made, someone will exploit that process. Count on it.

Regulation won't be the problem. Lack of it will.  No one will be there to say "you can't do that" and so they will.

You have a highly overinflated estimation of the people's effect on Congress. 
They are poised to remove title ii certification at the behest of corporations in spite of the public outcry. Do you think you matter anymore?

Doesn't it seem to limit the future of bitcoin? If it's not simple enough for the average idiot to use, how is it ever going to go mainstream?
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:23:57
Ok - then bitcoiners will have to accept that they may have to pay money, either to a VPN or to their ISP to maintain access to the bitcoin network. It's desirable and some people will willingly pay for it, so they should. Right? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:49:55
Yup. $5 here, $5 there ... it adds up. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:09:03
Put another way - we should have to pay because there is an opportunity for someone to make a buck; and someone is always willing to pay.

How much effort have you seen to break up Comcast?
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:09:25
That's an extra cost too - not much, but enough to obliterate any altcoins.

 I'd rather react to it when it happens.
WHEN ... not if.

Moving because the internet sucks is impractical. 
If my job is in Houston; my family, my wife's job, our friends and our kids' friends - what amounts to our entire life - it's not even an option - not a quick one anyway and certainly irresponsible. And in 99% of the US, it wouldn't make a difference anyway: things are the same with respect to ISP choice, or lack of it.
Voting with my feet would amount to leaving the country. It shouldn't have to come to that.

In most places in the country, another ISP can't simply move in and pick up customers - usually because of regulatory capture. Other times, ISPs have unwritten agreements not to compete with each other.
So if Comcast is your only choice, and they decide to "bundle" Bitcoin network access in with something for a fee, you're stuck. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:54:17
I hope.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:42:29
My guess is, if it manifests and correct me if this isn't possible, they will block all bitcoin transactions unless you pay for the "bundle" that includes bitcoin.
That's when you'd have to use a VPN I suppose. 
Do you expect VPN prices to increase of demand increases? More VPN's available?
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:57:09
Motivation? An ISP could see the potential to take a few percent off of each transaction to pad the bottom line - a "processing fee." That's free money. That's the motive.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:32:10
So, either pay $15/mo to access the ports, or $15/mo to a VPN. Either way, you pay.
