I buy a decent amount of bitcoin. Just thought this would be fun. not planning on making any money back.
@_date: 2014-05-07 13:20:18
I just hope the low prices stick around until my year long buying strategy finishes
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:14:44
While I do not disagree, I think convincing these merchants to use a free currency that will make them more money will be SIGNIFICANTLY easier than convincing them to throw away their $500+ dollar iPad, buy a new tablet, convert their existing POS system, etc.
So looking more for a soft solution. I'm more interested in more places accepting BTC then waging a war on proprietary software ad-infinitum.
Pick your battles and all that.

I am relatively new to this. The one time i bought bitoins before was with Coin.mx
Is coinbase fairly reputable?
Also, how does it differ from an exchange?

I'm afraid it would be very slow. I guess if the QR code was for a wallet which sent an email every time a payment hits, then that would be sufficient.
