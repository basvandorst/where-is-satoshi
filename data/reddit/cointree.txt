Hey there. Yeah, we've experienced a technical issue today that's caused the price issue. The team is working on resolving it as quickly as possible.
Meanwhile, your bitcoin is safe. You can verify this yourself by going to the Receive Bitcoin page and clicking the safety link. This will take you to a 3rd party site (blockchain.info) that will show your account balance.

Hi there. That doesn't sound right at all! Please raise this with our support team and we'll look into this for you.

All fair points. There's a tricky balance all exchanges, including Cointree, face here in Australia. We'd all love to simply let everyone purchase bitcoin without any fuss. However the reality is that while the industry is currently unregulated, the landscape is quickly moving and there are existing and upcoming laws that any legit service should be abiding to.
If it is any consolation, most Australian services use a service called Green ID. I can't speak for the other guys, but with our current process, most of the ID information such as drivers license and passport details goes directly to them. We never see it. Green ID is fully compliant with Australia's privacy laws and you can find more information on their site if you wish to explore further.
The photo with the written statement is something we introduced to minimise fraud. It greatly reduces people being tricked into giving their ID details to scammers who then open accounts in their name. It ultimately protects the general public and the industry's reputation, which we consider a good thing especially while bitcoin is still new, and sometimes scary, to a lot of people.
I hope this helps explain things from our perspective somewhat. As earlylegend said, localbitcoins is an alternative too. Though please take caution as their privacy polices may or may not be as robust as an exchange like Cointree.

Hey CoinJar just added POLi  
And this is crazy  
But [CoinTree's]( POLi supports a ton of banks  
So try that maybe?  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
we love our [outdated meme's]( in all seriousness though, it's great to see more services support POLi! keep up the good work CoinJar!

Thanks for the feedback.
Our current goal is to lower the barrier to entry for those new to bitcoin. For these users, buying bitcoin is the main action they want to perform and we've chosen not complicate that by listing a sell price. For more experienced users, you can use the following url to view the buy/sell price at any time. These prices are the actual prices - we don't charge fees on top of these, unlike other Australian exchanges.

CoinSpots prices tends to fluctuate quite a lot. It has actually just increased in price again and CoinTree is back to  With the way their site is setup, the price doesn't change until the next transaction. So there tends to be periods where their price looks really great or really bad. With CoinTree, the price shown is always what you'll get.

Thanks for your feedback. I'll pass it on to the team. The primary focus for launch was streamlining the buy/sell process and lowering the barrier to entry for all users. Now that we have launched, we can look at adding features for power users such as yourself.
Since there's no fees involved, there's no reason you can't buy from CoinTree, send the bitcoin elsewhere to sell if you like. We don't mind. We are here to improve the experience for everyone.
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:25:57
Yes, you're right and it is a good point to make. From the start, CoinTree was designed to lower the barrier of entry for purchasing bitcoin and part of that design was to not pair up users. It has allowed us to focus on streamlining the purchase process and provide a pleasant site to use.
@_date: 2014-07-31 23:49:16
CoinTree now supports overseas customers. In your account, go to the Security page and then ID Verification. There are now instructions on how to become easily verified.

Auto top-up uses funds from a user's CoinTree account, so all of the existing methods work (bank transfer and local cash deposit). If auto top-up is turned on, a user's bitcoin will be replenished automatically as they spend/use bitcoin.
Competition is a good thing. Here's a great site that lists the Australian exchanges. We are not affiliated with them in any way. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 05:26:22
There are no fees for paying bills, and no limits such as amount or frequency. Our goal is to help people use bitcoin and make the process as easy as possible.

Hi BitSpot,
Marshmallowball let the cat out of the bag a tad too soon but that's all good. We've seen a good response, prompting us to sign up here on Reddit. Our team will be in contact with you and the others on Monday to issue your beta logins as I suspect marshmallow doesn't have enough to go around.
Thanks for your interest,
The CoinTree team

Knowing your bitcoin is safe is important, which is why we are transparent about how we keep your wallet safe (it's in the FAQ link in OP) and provide proof of solvency, allowing you to check your bitcoin balance externally at any time. We are more than happy for you to transfer bitcoin straight to your own wallet if you like.
We haven't seen CoinJar beat our price today. Note that they list the spot price so you need to look at the buy/ask price and then add their 2% fee on top of that. With CoinTree, we always list the actual buy price you pay. A natural site such as comparebitcoins.net is good for seeing the true price for each Australian exchange. CoinTree is not affiliated with them in any way.
@_date: 2014-06-26 06:35:18
Thanks! Full focus was on launch and unfortunately we won't be able to make this conference. We plan to be a much bigger part of the community from here on out.

We actually use more than one bank to make it easy for our users deposit at a local branch that suites them best. We also allow deposits from any bank through online banking. For the list of banks, see the Add Funds page inside the Instant Demo.

A little late to the party but your post may be helpful for others seeking options. And a little self-promotion too. CoinTree ( has just recently opened up to the public and is very easy to use. There is an instant demo on the homepage, allowing you to go through the buying process without obligation. CoinTree is also very competitive price-wise (source: comparebitcoins.net)

My apologies for any offense occurred. Just trying to help. Yes, I'm from CoinTree and thought it could be useful to have some insight into why Australian exchanges typically have low POLi caps. It looked like doing a single $20k purchase was more important than using POLi in this particular case.
Anyway, looking at the responses, you have a few good options now. A number of exchanges provide cash deposits if you're after speed, and I see one of CoinJar's founders have mentioned a way to increase POLi limits if you prefer POLi and not in a hurry.
@_date: 2016-11-13 22:02:55
Hi there. POLi is somewhat risky for Australian exchanges like us to support, hence the low limits. If you're happy with cash deposits there are a few of us that support purchases that high. I recommend [CoinTree]( :) There's also Brighton Peak and BitTrade.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:47:40
Auviewer gave some good options. [Cointree.com.au]( is a nice easy way too if you're a fan of Coinbase's simplicity.
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:06:57
Hi there. We use a number of overseas exchanges, take their order books and factor in their respective currencies' live exchange rate. It looks like the bitcoin price ranges from $365 to $368 in this example, about a $3 difference. It's likely it's just the engine taking in all the variables and calculating the best price possible at any given time. I'll have the team look into it though, just to be sure. Thanks for reporting the concern.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:41:02
Hi there. We stopped taking deposits around October last year while we streamlined purchases. Took a bit longer than excepted and we've been open again since early this year. We now offer BPAY, cash and instant deposits using POLi Payments.
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:40:33
Everything is back to normal now :)
A bit of background for anyone curious. CoinTree doesn't actually hold any bitcoin ourselves and instead uses a number of suppliers behind the scenes, making purchases in real-time as needed. The model allows us to be one of the cheapest in Australia as we aren't taking additional risk by hedging our bets on bitcoin's price. Due to the spike in demand that all exchanges are seeing at the moment, we experienced a small window where we anticipated liquidity on our primary supplier running lower than demand. It's been resolved now and you can buy to your hearts content. Happy bitcoining!

Hi there,
Happy to hear you received your bitcoin nice and quick, and apart from the ID issue, had a good experience!
In terms of the ID process being quite particular, it is a trade off for being able to verify our customers over the internet. Most Australian exchanges won't let the first purchase happen until ID is verified, but we see this as unnecessarily delaying your first bitcoin purchase, so we allow purchases to happen and try to highlight as much as possible that ID will be required to send bitcoin out of your CoinTree account. Clearly we can do better with this communication and I have passed it on to the team to brainstorm ideas.
Thank you for trying CoinTree and sharing your experience. We hope to see you back soon. Happy bitcoin adventures!
