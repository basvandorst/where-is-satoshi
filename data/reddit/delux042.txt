To come full circle Mark Karpeles will reveal that he is in fact...Satoshi Nakamoto.

"My friend is a mathematical genius and will be setting up the algorithms in order to actually process bitcoin mining."
Looks like he don't know how bitcoin mining works.  With BFL unit it will take about the same skills as creating a facebook account.
If he order a bfl unit now, the 50k order before you will get it first.

You can mine addresses

It's not even mined.  XRP are not coins.

Same, I already have GPU miners and this is going to be one loud and hot ride this summer.

I don't know how would I react if I were to sell bitcoin and met a 12 y/o.  
@_date: 2013-05-14 14:58:32
Mine litecoin or sell GPU's. 
Most will probably mine LTC
@_date: 2013-05-10 20:56:58
and pay with bitcoins
@_date: 2013-04-21 12:23:16
Bitcoins all over the news ---&gt; New influx of people ---&gt; Same questions everyday.  Surprised?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:52:44
LoL @ Ripple.  Concept is nice but Ripple points (XRP) are laughable.
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:47:09
There is nothing else to add.  Any payment method that can be charged back is invalid because you can't prove you have sent the bitcoins.

Thoses comments...  
All thoses shouting "BFL is a scam" are likely new comers from last month price jump and have no idea.  bfl buisness pratice is undoubtedly shady but saying they're a scam or that they have no product is plain stupid. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:26:15
Bitmit is pricier but it's cheaper on reddit with ppl like me.
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:41:33
"A big pain"?  Please, It's almost the same,  Guiminer....
I'm also mining litecoin @ 4Mh/s and your comment makes me think that you are not an experienced miner...

Seems like a lot of money for a personal experience.

You should see the alternate crypto section of bitcointalk.  New cryptos everyday !
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:50:44
Yes.  Money you have on an exchange is on your account on their website.  If you want to "own" your coins you then need to transfer them to your personal wallet that no one has access of.
@_date: 2013-08-27 23:13:30
Crap post with no information, c'mon don't let this sub die from the reddit curse with poor posts like this.

Stop making dumbfounded financial analysis please.  The beginning of your post was ok, we should ban meme from this sr.

It's not us that has to trust them, it's them that has to trust bitcoin.
Bitcoin stands by itself, it does not need any support from company or regulators approval.  It might move the price around but ultimately that's changes nothing to bitcoin itself.

No it's bioshock infinite, I'll sell it for 6.5 ltc

One word : Litecoin

Short term profit.
@_date: 2013-06-07 21:11:54
Entry barrier is still quite high.  It's not as easy as one would think to anonymously buy millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-04 03:33:24
1 btc in 2.197 days
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:03:25
check out and shameless plug : I still have some bioshock, crysis and farcry blood dragon for sell.
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:45:08
Then the government can says to theses online businesses that accepting bitcoin is illegal.  Checkmate?
Also the more tax evasion there is going to be, the government can cut taxes on product and focus more on lands.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:41:15
Most GPU miners and gpu farms will likely switch to alternate crytos.    
@_date: 2013-05-24 20:26:01
Everything bitcoin is open source.  Ripple is not.  XRP were created to make the creator rich.  Some ppl already have ten thousands of xrp on bitcointalk.  XRP are not coins and should simply not exist in the current form.
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:11:52
People who got ASICs
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:54:06
You mean your mining it to find it in 523454363763637 years ?
@_date: 2013-05-24 20:17:45
It's even better than paying cash now.  Merchant would have to use pre authorized receiving address.  That way all transaction can be verified.  They could give you a receipt and you could even do the govt job checking that this address is the legit one.  Govt can send "undercover buyers" to verify that the merchant used the pre-authorized address, basically the same that they do now with cash.  
It's even better than cash transactions imo because even the customer could see if merchants are commiting fraud. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 03:32:47
Damn this deal is generous I will go ahead and 
@_date: 2013-06-10 15:41:24
Yeah well we are not all rich millionaires like you.  For some mortal like us 3/4 of a million is enough to work.     
GPUs botnet?  Please.  The biggest one was a massive fail targeted for gaming pc.  It mined 13 btc in 2 weeks.  
  
Just stfu if you don't know what you're talking about. Botnets are shit at this point.
@_date: 2013-06-09 15:16:55
Devs make way much more with their own in-game currency. See d2jsp, it's incredibly controversed, banned by some like Blizzard.
But yeah Bitcoin&gt;fg&gt;in-game

No, he is spending them on russian hitmens...on btc-e.

It's also illegal to buy weed and cocaine on the street/store.  While it's not to buy bananas and bread.

Every bitcoin GPU miner after asics hit.

I think alternate crypto chains can contribute to the system and make it better.
One of the basis of bitcoin is free market.  Let the people decide if litecoin is worth it or not.
@_date: 2013-04-27 02:58:53
and.... what??  what should I do ???  Don't leave me on a cliffhanger.

wallet.dat is what you gotta look for.  Scan all your drives.
@_date: 2013-04-28 13:39:01
Mine Litecoin
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:20:07
Kinda shows you the knowledge of OP.  If you mess with bitcoin, read about all the security aspects.  A single password with 10 chars isnt enough anymore.  
Get keepass and truecrypt for your wallets.
@_date: 2013-06-10 14:54:08
FTC is listed on btc-e with a market cap of $ 768,358.  Do you see why now ?
LTC has a market cap of $ 44,375,222   
 
Doing a 51% of ltc network would require at least around 19 Gh/s so about $9.5 M worth of 7950gpu.  The biggest cpu botnet on earth wouldn't come close to that.   
Stop talking out of your ass.

Nice one.  Must be a short name, Gap between 8 and 9 letter is astronomical.
@_date: 2013-06-19 13:45:01
From the thread it seems like it's because he is mining at diff 500
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:55:25
Because people don't like theses lazy answers.  It's like when you say to someone that he should google something and he answer "sorry I don't google".  Well live with your problem then.

@_date: 2013-08-27 23:11:00
That's what I believe too.  A man in an unique position like him doesn't need money.  He needs people help and I'm sure a couple of millionaire philanthropists tried to befriend him after those events.  The guy seem really intelligent, I'm sure his wallet is fine.

Already too late to mine with cpu. Even if you have 100 000 of them
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:26:31
Litecoin is already doing that.

Litecoin is solid 2nd and actually present advantages. NMC and PPC are SHA-256 it has the same mining fate as bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:43:47
I think you missed something about how bitcoin transactions works.
@_date: 2013-04-27 01:21:53

Daily lols?    Reclaim BTCs?
For some people the only way to learn is the hard way and whining on reddit sure ain't going to help.

Are we going to post all theses scam?  There is going to be millions of them.
It's the internet, don't fucking send your money to randoms.  
It reminds me when the phishing started and everyone was sending email to warn other people about it.

Look up recent auction by ASICminer on btctalk.  That's about the fastest you can get but no they are not cheap.
@_date: 2013-04-17 13:28:45
lmk if you get some bitcoin or litecoin or you know, just mine some with your graphic card.

check out cgminer, it hash faster from what ive seen
