Moronic statement.  It has only existed for less than a decade and has its value set by the market.  How could it possibly be dispersed enough to reduce volatility.  I would expect large rises and falls for at least the next 10 years.

In exchange for what?

Does Circle not already do what you describe?
@_date: 2016-08-01 09:01:58
Blocksize increase
@_date: 2016-04-02 12:39:13
It turns out for me what I believed was bitcoin turned out to be DASH.  I currently do not know what bitcoin in its current form is.
@_date: 2016-04-02 14:56:48
Please explain how the masternodes are easily exploited?
@_date: 2016-04-02 08:56:48
Surely no one could sit through 12 minutes of that!

So he can see no problem employing 30% females out of a total 15% population.  All in the name of not being discriminating. Haha
It is shit like this that will finish a lot of big firms.  Employ the person best for the job.

When you see it, bet big!
@_date: 2015-05-23 11:14:51
Far to expensive.  Defeats the point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:23:04
I would love to know when it was decided Bitcoin was not capable of replacing Western Union. I personally still believe it is.

How long does it take to get the deposit limit above $100? I like your platform but can't get any money in it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:59:32
Yes it's great less people using Bitcoin. What a success!
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:45:41
Completely unconvincing. The blocksize could be increased safely allowing increased adoption right now. Of course other methods will need to be employed to increase throughput exponentially, but why not buy time with the obvious simple solution of increasing the blocksize?

Majority hash power leaves for bitcoin cash and core Pow change to a new alt coin.
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:34:47
And I thought the miners already got paid via block reward.
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:36:55
He is correct

Who cares it's here and not going away. The BBC and their pals will just continue their journey into irrelevance.

I have recently had to do this with my mother. I went all in at $220 as could see significant support at that level, and I am also young enough to take the loss.
I tried to explain what bitcoin was at the time and was met with blank stares. Once the price has trebled can't she can't get money in fast enough.  I had to refuse to buy her more haha.

How does the routing work between peers without a direct channel open?
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:35:32
lol how's that working out
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:37:39
Yes, and that this nonsense comes from a Core dev is sad.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:09:33
Utter crap. People do not need your permission to change Bitcoin because you run a node. You will simply just get left behind on a network nobody else recognises if the economic majority decide to change the protocol. 
Luckily you wouldn't get punished for stupidly believing this crap as your coins would still be valid on the upgraded chain. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:56:56
lol. Who the fuck are Wayniloans?
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:39:18
You obviously have your agenda so little point in debate.

The incentive for miners is exactly the same as what stops them stealing bitcoins on the main chain. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:56:17
This is not some small group attempting a take over it is everybody else except Core and a vocal minority who seem intent on holding Bitcoin back.
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:14:02
Your Bitcoin belongs to us now. The US government is the largest crime organisation on the planet. I remember they pulled the same shit with my online poker money.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:30:26
At last Bitcoin is being allowed to grow. Core have held Bitcoin back before there was any reason to. Capacity should have been increased a long time ago.
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:09:29
I would rather trust the future of Bitcoin in miners who have heavily invested in equipment than some tit running a Pi in their bedroom.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:17:46
Please tell me why I am wrong. You really see zero conflict of interest here?
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:22:01
Litecoin is a copy and paste of bitcoin. The reason there is no drama is because nobody actually use it. Why use litecoin when bitcoin has so many decimal places?
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:02:31
Nonsense! Once Bitcoin miners steal Bitcoins they brick their hardware. Miners are the backbone of Bitcoin that provide the security to the network not somebody running a RPi in their bedroom.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:50:31
If people can just send on chain why pay Blockstream? They have purposely created a problem to provide a solution. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:31:17
Backdoor inflation of the 21M coin limit. Those cheerleading this can not hold any serious amount of bitcoin and must be paid shills. Ridiculous  
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:26:25
How people can not see the clear conflict of interest between Blockstreams business model and scaling bitcoin is amazing. Wake up people Bitcoin needs bigger blocks now.
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:38:50
I like this.
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:14:59
Bitcoin is still decentralised with 8MB blocks. All that is currently happening is people are using other blockchains. How many users currently use LN on Litecoin seeing as segwit has been active a while now?
It is far too early to be sending users away.
@_date: 2016-07-01 07:08:04
I originally used coinbase for all my purchases until they got far to invasive with the information they were demanding.  I know exclusively use Circle.
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:30:10
I support a increase in the blocksize to stay ahead of demand until better options are available. Drivechains for me are a no brainer as best method for hyperbitcoinisation. A production ready version is not available however.
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:47:27
Oh it is happening.
