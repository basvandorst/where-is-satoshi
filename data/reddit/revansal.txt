Okay, easiest way. Download minergate app, create an account, start mining. Make sure the ipod is plugged in a fully charged, keep it somewhere where if the battery explodes nothing else can be damaged/caught on fire (unlikely). More likely your ipod will overheat and stop working. You will need to be connected to wifi as well.

You will never get your ROI back unless you have a bunch of slightly older phones just sitting around. Even $20-30 a phone you'll never see a return because most can't handle being at full load that long without failing. 
Phone mining is there just for fun, I'll use it sometimes to show how easy it is to start mining but always recommend doing it with a PC.

Any other standard reddit buzzwords you would like to add in to your post? I think you forgot mysoginist, sexist, and xenophobe off the top of my head. 
Yes because Obama going around apologizing to everyone definitely had everyone respecting us. Hell other nations don't respect us so much that NATO countries just pledged an additional $140 Billion because Trump told them too. So much disrespect. 
TDS in the wild, always a good time.

Yeah how dare he care about men's rights. What a dick. Doesn't he know there are women out there in the US who don't have the right to.... to..... well I'm sure there's something women aren't allowed to do that men are. What an asshole. It's not like men have to worry about being killed, assaulted, losing parental rights, or not have their mental health taken seriously at an exponential rate compared to women or anything. 
That was sarcasm in case you weren't sure. Evidence points to him more likely being right than wrong. You're a tool and deserve every downvote.
EDIT: a word

TIL crime doesn't exist in other "free" countries.

Yeah I totally support woman hating because I also support some men's rights issues. The leap of logic there is astounding. I agree with his argument, and if the roles were reversed I would still agree. 
Thread starter may be a dumbass woman hating cuck most of the time, but his post is sound advice, especially when dealing with money of the amount OP potentially has in bitcoin if he got in in 2013. Either prove the argument right or wrong based on its own merit. Trying to attack the author as a way to disprove his argument is stupid.

People posting articles from everydayfeminism about male privilege don't get to call things beta, even if the MGTOW movement does have a ridiculous number of fucking losers, trying to cope with their lot in life.

They're right though. You clearly don't understand whats going on.

You think the FED is the government? LOL the FED is a private bank.

The FED doesn't print money so yeah I'll keep telling myself that.
