Did you watch their talk at Money2020? I didn't, and there is no video available, so in judging their delivery we can only rely on the [dozens]( [of reports]( that large portions of the audience walked out because of the delivery. 
I'm not insulting them; public speaking is very difficult, and not everyone can be good at it. I'm suggesting that, given the significant evidence that public speaking is not their forte, they should refrain from taking up keynote slots that could go to someone who specializes in speaking publicly about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:53:11
Is there a point at which you would consider giving your high-profile speaking slots to someone who specializes in public speaking re: Bitcoin? From what I've seen the reaction to your Money2020 presentation was generally negative. Do you believe it was better for Bitcoin and the community for you to speak instead of, say, Andreas? And if it wasn't better for Bitcoin, but you took the slot because it would help your business, then why should the community go out of its way to support you?

I haven't seen a video of the talk so I'm not sure if this directly addresses the part of the presentation you're referencing. FWIW, anthropologists and historians do *not* agree that money arose when barter systems became unwieldy. In fact, as far as I know there is [not a single example]( of a society that has ever functioned based on the barter system. That being said, it seems plausible that gold is uniquely well-suited as a means of exchange between strangers.

I definitely agree with you that this presentation content wasn't a good fit for the specific audience. Just curious, have you seen anyone saying that the public speaking skills *weren't* an issue? Not even looking for a compliment, just someone who thinks they were neutral.

I've already made my first Bitcoin purchase from Overstock. Here's the confirmation screen: 
@_date: 2014-11-20 22:01:00
1. Sean's Outpost is not a 501c*, but they are a not-for-profit corporation in the State of Florida. I'm not clear on what distinction you're drawing here?
2. I assume the one occasion you're referring to was in October when Jason asked for donations because Sean's Outpost was low on funds. I'm not sure how running across the US with a branded RV with an explicit goal to raise 1,000 Bitcoins is separated out from soliciting donations. BUT I am not an expert on Florida charity law, which is why I did not respond to that part of his post.
3. I'm not asking Jason to prove a negative; I'm asking him to provide whatever documentation he just used, this week, to arrive at the numbers in his post. I'm also not asking about .0000001 BTC; there are 387 BTC unaccounted for, which is a sizable amount by any standard.
4. I'm not talking about detailed blockchain records, just asking what the other address was that people sent 387 BTC to. In terms of the fiat receipts, they've told me that they have all the receipts from their purchases over the past year+.

Thank you for responding Jason. I appreciate that I threw a ton of questions your way, and you only have so much time before your flight. I'll hold off on responding to most of this until you've landed and had a chance to get your feet under you.
I do want to quickly clarify one thing in regards to the dissolution issue. I just got off the phone with the relevant Florida department (Reinstatements, 850-245-6059), and they confirmed again that they show no records of having received either the fee or the form for reinstatement. Are you 100% sure that you have paid the fee and made the filing? I am concerned about this not because I have a great love for the State of Florida, but because there is a direct contradiction here, and in general bureaucracies are pretty good at accepting money.

There are a couple interesting issues raised here:
1. Moolah/Ryan Kennedy/Alex Green has been ordered not to sell any of the BTC that rightfully belong to Syscoin. If these funds have been mixed with other coins (rightfully obtained, taken from MintPal depositors, received from defrauded investors in MooPay LTD), which addresses and/or unspent outputs is he forbidden from making use of? This could have important implications for the legal status of BTC fungibility in the UK.
2. Ryan may well have 750 BTC to return to Syscoin, or to sell for cash to pay Syscoin and avoid serious consequences. However, if he's mixed the Syscoin BTC with MintPal deposits or otherwise linked them on the blockchain, he may not be able to do so without proving he has control over the funds he claims were 'hacked.' 
3. Imagine this case was taking place in the US. Assume that Ryan was ordered to return Syscoin's BTC. Could he argue that cryptographically signing a statement proving control of certain unspent outputs (as takes place in any BTC transaction) could potentially be an admission of guilt, and therefore claim a 5th Amendment right to remain silent and avoid incriminating himself? This wouldn't be a get-out-of-jail-free card, but I think it's important to consider the implications of Bitcoin transactions as speech in a trial context.

I think we're all confronting the same problem; it's not clear how to effectively evaluate organizations in the crypto world that opt out of traditional legal safeguards and haven't yet adopted cryptographic transparency or safeguards. 
I have never been to Satoshi Forest, and I may not have even met anyone who has. I don't know whether their services are the most efficient in the area, or how donations are used. I'm not sure how anyone without access to their financials could know these things.
The community is being asked to give their money to an organization based on trust alone; if the history of bitcoin's early days illustrates anything, it's the danger of sending money to strangers because other strangers seem to trust them.

I've only been able to come up with three mechanisms for accountability in situations like this:
1. Try to hash things out in public, which is what I'm pursuing, but can definitely turn into a witch hunt/kangaroo court
2. Work with Jason to identify independent third parties who can examine the situation in private and then give the public a baseline assessment. So far Jason has declined my efforts to help with such a process.
3. Report Sean's Outpost to the authorities and let them sort it out, which I would be reluctant to do under any circumstances, let alone when there's no clear evidence of wrongdoing.
If there's a fourth option that I'm missing, please let me know!

But every organized charity I've donated to is a 501c3; as imperfect as this system is, it guarantees a certain base level of transparency. As a potential donor, I'm being asked to rely on some pictures of meals being served as proof of... I'm not sure what exactly. How much did they raise last year? How much did they spend? How many meals were served as a result? Are there any receipts that can help confirm the number of meals served? I'm not suggesting he start a new accounting system today, but surely there must be some transparency measures that are low hanging fruit.
Not trying to be argumentative, but unless you've seen their books I'm not sure how you would be able to know for sure if they're running at a loss or not. It's probably true, but no way to view ultimately unless I'm missing something.

I don't see that I'm doing anything past this, and LTB certainly isn't. I think asking tough questions, and seeing how they're answered, helps everyone involved make more informed judgements about who they trust with their time and money. I see it as a spectrum/continuum of concern; there is a lot of space between "it's 100% clear that everything is above board" and "there is definitive proof of criminal activity." I have no interest in reporting Jason to the police and watching Sean's Outpost get shut down over a technicality, if it turns out that he's using everyone's donations honestly and responsibly.

All numbers provided by Jason have been increased by 35%; without knowing which was provided by Jason and which was provided by me, I think it would be very difficult for a third party to tell.
To date, Sean's Outpost has raised approximately 1,297 BTC (since March of 2013) at a total cash value of approximately $317,965.
Of the total donations, 731 BTC were provided from my wife and I at an approximate cash value of $119,991.

Thanks! My second bitcoin tip I believe
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:58:08
As I have said to Jason privately, I think this post is a great first step towards transparency and their stated goal of becoming a trustless organization. Clearly Sean's Outpost has accomplished a great deal, and it is understandable that they prioritized outreach to the homeless over paperwork and accounting.
That being said, there are a number of issues that I asked Jason to address when he sent me a draft of this post, which still remain. While the financial disclosures released today are detailed and show a desire to be transparent, the lack of supporting documentation still leaves the community in the position of having to trust that the numbers we receive are correct. Specifically:
1. Without providing the bitcoin addresses that received all of the donations, there is no documentation to back up the information about how many BTC Sean's Outpost has received. The two public addresses I have managed to find have received a combined total of 556 BTC, which means there is another 387 BTC donated from unknown addresses to unknown addresses. I have asked Jason if there is a reason he cannot share these addresses, and have not received a reply.
2. Without providing any receipts, bills, or statements, there is no documentation to back up the information about how much Sean's Outpost has spent in USD. I have asked Jason if there is any disadvantage to posting whatever documentation he used to calculate these expenses, and have not received a reply. [In this comment]( I have created a made-up financial statement with every number of Jason's inflated by 35%; without any reference to documentation, there is no way for any third party to distinguish between the two sets of numbers.
3. There may be good reasons why Jason is not comfortable making public these two types of documentation. I have urged him, if that is the case, to bring in a pro-bono accountant and a blockchain analysis expert who would, for free, examine the documentation and then publicly attest that donated funds have been used responsibly. I have offered to help with the process of recruiting these people; so far, Jason has not expressed interest in bringing in such third parties.
Going forward, I also have concerns that the organizational structure Jason describes will not have the intended effect of producing accountability and transparency that is "exponentially better." 
As I see it, a charity can be transparent and accountable to:
1. The blockchain. One dimension of this is to make sure that all transactions are carried out using addresses known to be associated with Sean's Outpost, and it sounds like this is the plan going forward. Another dimension is to use multi-signature technology to prevent misuse of funds. I think it is very important to be clear about how the multi-signature approach Jason outlines does and does not accomplish this. Specifically, all three keyholders are personal friends, and two of the three are *both* the main employees at Sean's Outpost as well as 2/3 of the board of directors. Multi-sig is just a tool, and it only provides oversight and controls when it puts keys in the hands of people exercising oversight and control. Jason and Mike already run the organization on a day-to-day basis, have control of the finances, and make up a majority of the board. We are still being asked to trust Jason and Mike, and I don't see how this particular multi-sig implementation changes that.
2. The organization's board of directors. In the case of Sean's Outpost, Jason, Mike, and Jason's wife make up the board of directors. For obvious reasons, this does not seem like a good setup to hold Jason and Mike accountable for delivering on the organization's goals effectively. I would strongly, strongly encourage Jason to bring outside voices onto the board of directors.
1. The government. For political reasons, Jason has chosen not to pursue 501c3 status and the disclosure obligations that go with it. He has every right to do so, but it does mean that the need for transparency and accountability shifts to other social mechanisms.
3. The public. To repeat myself from above, while the financial disclosures above are a good first step, the public cannot evaluate them effectively while documentation of the revenues and expenses are not made available.

I've offered to help them obtain these services for free, and Jason has declined. I've spent dozens of hours talking with various people connected to Sean's Outpost, including Jason, so this isn't a case of me not wanting to put in the time. 
Also, I'm not really asking him to do any additional work. Presumably they looked at receipts and the blockchain to arrive at the numbers they posted; I'm just asking them to post the inputs they just used to create this output.

There may be different legal requirements for transparency, but communities and potential donors always have an obligation to hold the recipients of their donations accountable. We may not be able to force transparency through legal mechanisms, but we can exert public pressure like we are doing now. If the costs of non-transparency become very high and they still refuse to provide more information, it will be a strong indicator that there is something wrong.

I completely understand what you're saying, and it echoes feedback I've gotten in the past. I haven't figured out yet how to ask these types of questions in a way that avoids coming across as unreasonably intense; I'm not sure if there is a way to do so, but I'm certainly trying. A few thoughts:
1. I'm not really asking him to do any additional work. Presumably they looked at receipts and the blockchain to arrive at the numbers they posted; I'm just asking them to make public the inputs they just used to create this output. And if there's a reason it can't be made public, I'm offering to help figure out a private way to do some verification, for free.
2. For context, Jason and I emailed back and forth all day yesterday. He stopped responding when I asked him why he didn't want to provide either the other blockchain addresses or the receipts. If he had given any indication that he needed more time to do these things, or was interested in understanding why I thought this documentation was important, I would have phrased things very differently. He's made it clear to me that he believes the information he provided today is sufficient to establish that all donations have been used responsibly. I'm just making it clear that I disagree, and it's up to others to make up their own mind.

Litecoin's modifications (faster confirmation times and additional decentralization of mining) have some tradeoffs, but from an overall cost-benefit approach I think it's fair to say they are improvements. The thing is, why switch to Litecoin instead of one of the newer altcoins that has an even faster confirmation time, or one that can be mined using a CPU instead of a fancy graphic card setup? There are [dozens of cryptocurrencies]( competing with Litecoin to replace Bitcoin, so those who would switch for purely technical reasons are spread out across dozens of coins. In the meantime, those who are concerned with infrastructure, adoption and awareness are all concentrated on Bitcoin. In order for a coin to overtake Bitcoin, I think it will need much stronger advantages than Litecoin has.

An administrative error is certainly possible, although I don't think it's a simple processing time delay because I asked the employees I spoke with if it was possible the fee had been paid and the system just hadn't been updated yet, and they said no. If this is an administrative error, it should be very easy for Jason to pay the fee and upload the annual report through the online interface again.

Edit: please read the response by +here: 
I'd like to clarify that I have absolutely no specific information about and do not have the necessary background or expertise to evaluate their programs even if I did have access to their books. The parallels I **do** see have to do with the way the community seems to be responding when questions of transparency are raised.
In at least some cases, because of status as a trusted member of the community, less information is demanded of him, people cite personal experience with him as evidence of his honesty, and some facts seem to be taken as proof of more than they actually prove.
Several of the top replies in [this thread]( reference personal experiences with the charity, or the length of time Jason's been involved with Bitcoin. These are important indicators of trustworthiness, but they are not a substitute for meaningful financial transparency, especially for a charity. The [only response]( from in that thread did not acknowledge the transparency concerns.
The fact that has inarguably provided some number of services to the homeless is not proof that all of the money has gone to those services, just as the fact that some MintPal customers have withdrawn their funds is not proof that Moolah/Ryan/Alex is an honest businessman. 
I believe we can and **must** demand more transparency, **especially** when it comes to charitable donations. Charities that seek to move beyond the traditional model of regulated 501c3 non-profits with public financial disclosure and provide transparency through the blockchain instead or in addition should be applauded, but any organization with **neither** form of accountability is asking for a level of trust that strikes me, personally, as unreasonable.
Again, I have no specific reason to believe that is anything other than a great charity. What I am saying is that the process and heuristics the community seems to be using to evaluate this charity are reminiscent of an approach I have just watched fail, with serious consequences for both individuals and the cryptocurrency community broadly.

I absolutely can't wait for smart contracts and more advanced scripting, but what happens if everyone on the network wants all their transactions to use the advanced scripting that only works on blocks mined by GHash? And blocks mined by other pools are essentially useless? Presumably other pools would start processing these transactions, but what if the GHash apps/services only functioned if the transaction took place in a GHash-mined block?
In macro terms, they appear to plan to use their hashing power to make money at the app/service level, which shouldn't pose a problem, but what if they decided to use their app/service power to gain hashing share? Wouldn't be profit maximizing, but could pose existential threat to the network?

Update: [Jason's response](
Looks like the formatting is a bit funky on the post, so here it is in reddit-format:
Hi Jason,
First off, I want to say that I believe Sean’s Outpost has a tremendously valuable mission. Any organization that has served over 125,000 meals to the homeless is doing amazing work, and deserves to be commended for that. 
When it comes to charitable organizations, I believe that transparency and accountability are extremely important. It is always the responsibility of a community to ensure that the individuals and organizations it entrusts with funds are using those funds responsibly. When an organization chooses not to make use of either cryptographic safeguards like multi-signature controls and public blockchain accounting, or the traditional structures for transparency and accountability such as 501c3 status and public financial filings, that communal responsibility is increased.
For the past few weeks I’ve been trying to get a full understanding of Sean’s Outpost’s operations. Based on my conversations with a number of people, there are several questions that have continued to be troubling. Obviously you are under no obligation to answer these questions, and they may seem aggressive, intrusive, and unfriendly, and for that I apologize. As I stated in my private message to you a few weeks ago, “I'm not trying to be a dick, just trying to create sustainable best practices to protect people”. I believe these are the sorts of questions that anyone asking for peoples’ money should have to answer, even if it is unpleasant to do so.
1. On September 26th, the State of Florida [initiated administrative dissolution of Sean’s Outpost]( for failure to file an annual report. On October 27th you said in a [comment on reddit]( “We have already done the process to become ‘in good standing’ again it's just not reflected on the sunshine website. It is quite embarrassing, but ultimately doesn’t effect operations at all.”  According to the State of Florida’s [Corporation Annual Reports/Reinstatements office]( they have no record of any action initiated to reinstate Sean’s Outpost, and the people I've spoken to affiliated with Sean's Outpost were not aware of the dissolution until yesterday. Can you explain this discrepancy? Surely being legally dissolved has at least some impact on operations? As one example, [this Florida statute ]( which can be found [here]( seems to prohibit the solicitation of funds prior to the approval of a charity’s renewal statement. 
2. In conjunction with your [Bitcoin Across America project]( in-browser wallet company Kryptokit provided Sean’s Outpost with [an RV]( Whose name is that RV currently legally titled in? Is it being used for Sean’s Outpost’s operations in Pensacola or Dallas?
3. In regards to Sean’s Outpost’s finances, has anyone other than you had direct control and access to the cryptocurrency donations to Sean’s Outpost since the organization was started?
4. What is the total amount of cryptocurrency donations received since Sean’s Outpost began? What percentage of these funds have been spent on Sean’s Outpost’s activities in Pensacola and Dallas? What funds remain?
5. Since August of 2013, Bitcoin address publicized on the Sean’s Outpost website ([1M72Sfpbz1BPpXFHz9m3CdqATR44Jvaydd]( has received a total of 483 BTC. On at least [one occasion]( a QR code provided by Sean’s Outpost caused a donor to give funds to an address other than the publicized address. You initially said that the alternate QR code had been [inserted by a malicious hacker]( but [later explained]( that it was an inadvertent mistake by a web contractor that had been resolved. Are there any other occasions where a donation was made to Sean’s Outpost to an address other than the ones publicized on the website? If so, how much has been donated that is not factored in to the 483 BTC total above? What address or addresses were used to accept donations prior to August of 2013?
6. On October 27th you stated in a [reddit comment]( that you “do not derive any salary or monetary compensation from Sean's Outpost. In fact, the cost of running Sean's Outpost has greatly outpaced the amount of donations we have received. The additional costs of operating have to date been covered by wife and I.”  Are there any of your expenses paid out of Sean’s Outpost’s donations that you don't consider to be monetary compensation? For instance, have donations paid for your meals, lodging, and travel to conferences? If so, how many BTC/how much USD would you estimate has gone towards these expenses? Finally, how much money/BTC have you and your wife donated to Sean’s Outpost, outside of the time you have donated?
7. Are you the same Jason King who was involved with the following companies and projects?
* The Ambrose Estate [ScrollQuest]( game/treasure hunt project. There appears to be a large [community]( of people who [believed]( they were the [victims of fraud]( in conjunction with this project.   
* [Aeon Integrity Systems]( which was dissolved in a tax forfeiture proceeding. There is a Jason King listed as a company director. 
* [Versatile Service Solutions]( which was dissolved in a tax forfeiture proceeding. There is a Jason King listed as a company director. 
* [Randall Roberts Incorporated]( which was dissolved in a tax forfeiture proceeding. There is a Jason King listed as a company director. There is a Kyle Swank also listed as a director. 
* [Helix Broadband]( which was dissolved in a tax forfeiture proceeding. There is no Jason King listed as a director, but there is a Kyle Swank listed as a director. It also appears that there is a Jason King who claimed to be the founder of Helix in a [Slideshare presentation from 2010]( and the same Evan Jensen who worked on Ambrose Estate also [lists Helix Broadband]( as a previous place of employment   
I sincerely hope that these questions can be addressed.

Don't worry, they made sure to include women inside the conference as well 
edit: don't forget that Moe Levin claimed that he could not un-invite Josh Garza/Paycoin from the conference because "sunlight is the best disinfectant." He [promised]( the following: "We think that a Q&amp;A period, moderated by someone you choose, will provide the proper forum for people to make their voices heard. We think that this layout, instead of a speech, is the appropriate forum.
This Q&amp;A session will be recorded and broadcast." As far as I understand it, he then proceeded to let Josh to back out of the Q&amp;A, without declining their sponsorship or otherwise distancing them from the conference/community/industry.

Nope. If he had nothing to do with Bitcoin, I'd expect him to at least give one example of something he'd been spending his time on over the past 10 years. I also think his denials are a bit over the top; he apparently has referred to Bitcoin as 'Bitcorn' several times. If you had media camped outside your house because they thought you'd invented something, wouldn't you take the time to learn how to pronounce it?
None of this is definitive, but based on the circumstantial evidence and my lack of confidence in his denials, I find it more likely than not (&gt;51%) that this is actually Satoshi. But again, I hope to be proved wrong!

Anyone with a conscience has gone through the same thought process. Unfortunately I'm not aware of any solution for a pro-social PoW system that also provides robust security.  Here's why Proof of Work *requires* that the work be completely useless:
Scenario 1: Completely useless SHA-256 hashing
* Cost of electricity burned by honest miners per block, who are damaging the environment and contributing nothing to the world beyond bitcoin hashrate:$1,000,000
* Cost to reliably 51% attack the network: x= $1,000,001
Scenario 2: Protein folding
* Cost of electricity burned by honest miners per block, who as a byproduct are contributing to scientific research in a win-win scenario for everyone: $1,000,000
* Cost to successfully 51% attack the network: x = $1,000,001 **minus the amount some hospital, researcher, or businessman is willing to pay for protein folding**. If someone who's never heard of bitcoin is willing to pay for $1,000,000 worth of protein folding, an attacker only needs to spend $1 to attack the network.
If there was a way for the bitcoin network to directly measure the burning of $20 bills instead of the rate at which mathematical problems are solved, it might switch over. It's the waste that provides the security :/
@_date: 2015-02-24 03:35:16
He's explained why many, many times; zero-confirmation transactions aren't secure, yet businesses act as if they are. So far there hasn't been enough money at stake to justify large amounts of effort spent on attacking this weakness, but if the  of zero-confirmation transactions increases that will change. Peter Todd wants to make it crystal clear that zero-confirmation transactions are insecure to force people to create alternatives, rather than relying on a status quo that cannot hold. You may agree with Jeff Garzik and others that this isn't a good approach, but there's clearly logical thought behind the proposal.
@_date: 2015-02-12 23:00:49

Obviously sometimes each assumption will be wrong, but erring on the side of positivity and faith in humanity makes for a community that is both happier and FAR more attractive to new people.

I'm really sorry to hear that. Do you need the money right away, or can you wait for the price to build back up?
