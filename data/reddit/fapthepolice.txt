There's no perfect moment, the mempool is only going to get bigger on cripplecoin.

Theymos would have deleted the announcement anyway, why should you care.
Their API-s at GDAX were showing support for BCH for almost a week, I guess I'm an insider now, lmfao

What's wrong with the "picture of my dog" offer?

Upvoted for visibility but it seems like a lost cause ...
I know of the charity though, op, and donated myself today. It can be done without the bitcoin community's help (2/3-s of the money has been collected in less than two weeks). Besides you're visiting the greediest subreddit hinting that you want to help with donations - ain't gonna work.
If you've seen the "bitcoin could help charities" argument around here keep in mind it is only used in hopes that it can raise the bitcoin price higher. People want to sell their bitcoins and buy new cars, noone gives a crap about charities.

As for the "not enough for now" comment...
almost 90k BGN and 10k euros have been donated, which makes up for about 2/3 of the money. I know the charity and donated, you should continue to do so as well and we can make it easily.

Nice google-bombing attempt. I like it :)

To the moo... oh wait

This is relevant to my interests :)
edit: although some ebook format might do better on the kindle :/ ... oh well, I'll read on my monitor, no big deal, this seems really interesting and engaging thus far...

Microsoft really need to step up their game now that they accept bitcoin. Windows phone is great but there's no open source/reputable company's wallet for it...

You're an inspiration, dude.
Installing and spoofing location when I wake up tomorrow ^_^

But I thought 1mb bitcoin is more secure. What do you mean it can't handle an attack?

Not to mention gigs don't cost $5 anymore, they cost $5.5 because of "processing costs".
I've asked fiverr customer support multiple times about bitcoin payments, since I actually prefer getting paid in cryptocurrency but it doesn't seem like they have the incentive to fix this anytime soon.

It's hard to cope with my inability to verify transactions, so yes, it's my loss.
But the entire security of the network is now in the hands of the evil Chinese, so I strongly urge you to wait until my network connection recovers.

No, bitcoin is a socialist invention, not a capitalist one. It's the easy to manipulate node counts that are really important.
People who are economically incentivised to secure the network via provable resource expenditure (and investment in innovations) are the devil.

Majestic gets 20k+ links, Open site explorer gets a measly 3500... Does anyone have an ahrefs membership?
I actually think this might not be someone's dedicated SEO efforts, but rather the community's desire to link there :)

I think he's referring to [this]( I might be wrong though.

WTF, guys, we've found Satoshi...
What a newbie mistake, man, must suck after successfully staying anonymous for 6 years
