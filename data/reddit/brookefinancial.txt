Thanks again guys this is very helpful. I'm at 70% progress to reset blockchains and transaction, once this is done I will try a new wallet and import the private keys there.

If it's a network problem what can I do? I can see that my wallet is clearly "ONLINE", my network connection is working, I'm in the basement, and in a rural area, but I can go on internet just fine.

Yes Electrum has the option and one user here has been helping me with this, I just made the transfer it should be on its way soon.
I should write that it's SOLVED. Thank you reddit!

I just made 'Reset Blockchain and Transactions' and I waited for it to synchronize... After it was completed and my balance was still showing up at 0....
Of course when I go there:  they say I still have my Bitcoin, at least this is reassuring.
So screw this, I will simply download MultiBit HD and import the private key in the new MultiBit HD if I understood well, my balance will show up there ?

You think that I need another wallet and it won't work with Multibit if I try again?  I'm not very hot on downloading a new wallet that I never heard of with money that is not mine, not that I don't trust you but I would prefer to do it with MultiBit.
If it's the only way however, I'm going to try Electrum.

I made the "Reset Blockchain and Transactions" option, I will keep you updated. I also exported my private keys if it doesn't work, I will try your wallet suggestions if it doesn't.
If it works, should I try again with my Multibit 0.5.15 ? And what do you mean by "be sure to increase the fee", they chose the fee automatically on MultiBit, I right 1 BTC and they say how much it costs, I don't think I can increase it.

I have MultiBit HD, the interface is a bit frustrating, there's no place to import the private keys. After trying our good old friend Google I did not found the answer to my problem, Multi Bit HD works with some stupid "words system" but that's not how MultiBit Classic works. There's a place on the support of MultiBit about going from MultiBit Classic to MultiBit HD but they are simply sayinf to transfer from one adress to another, if I can't see my balance in MultiBit Classic, I can't do much.... Sorry for wasting your time.

Alright, so I'm about to create a new wallet on Electrum, but they give me the option "Use public or private keys". When I select it, this is the page I get... pretty sure this is not the right place to import them....
Should I go forget this step, and create a new wallet instead?

I'm reading your link right now, this is for exporting the private keys. Once this is done, I should open a new wallet in Multibit 0.5.15 and import the private keys on this new wallet? Or I'm gonna have the same problem because Multibit is the problem?
Thank you very much by the way.

This is good news indeed, like gimpycpu just pointed out, it looks like the funds never left the wallet, but in my wallet I still see the 0 balance....
Should I simply restart my computer &amp; Multibit or this could compromise the transaction? Sorry if I sound incredibly noob but I never had to deal with something like this with Bitcoin.

Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaank you god, I feel really stupid, but I feel 565 times better that it worked lol.
I am extremely grateful for your patience, thank you internet. You can follow the transaction here:

Ok, so I have my private key file, I only need to download a new wallet (MultiBit HD or Electrum), and select "Import Private Keys" into a new wallet? This will "transfer" the BTC if I understand well, they won't be on the old MultiBit address anymore?
@_date: 2017-01-20 02:52:53
Looks like I figured it out and it worked. But it's not showing in my Electrum Balance that's normal for now?
There is nothing here also: 1HkRUaQxaKfbGu6XKho2FQnTrHxTs1xJwA
@_date: 2017-01-20 03:13:58
Yes I will be patient, now I can see the transaction on the blockchain I'm not worried, I was pretty scared when it was not showing up on MultiBit earlier tonight.
I should write that's it's solved, thank you a thousand times.

omg, this is incredibly reassuring
