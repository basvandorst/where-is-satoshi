So is Bitcoin legal in India now?

Bitcash is UP 40% today! Damn.

I concur.

Plus a color TV and temperature controlled environment.  That's the high life right there.

I think the biggest problem is that when you spend it 'legally' you have to declare capital gains, which is a pain in the ass.  If they had a point of sale tax on it, it could be spent like cash and everybody including the IRS would be happy.

I rented my kid out making I-phones in China.  Putting it all in Bitcoin.  I'm flying her back in business class from my gains later this year.

Mining bitcoin is slowly becoming the strongman's choice for easy, untraceable money.  Kim Jong Un is doing it too.  Pretty soon, Trump may be running an operation out of Trump tower.

All I want is a global decentralized currency that can remain stable enough to buy things with.  People trying to get rich off it are what drove the price so high, and eventually to the chaos we are witnessing now.  
I think if Bitcoin became more widely accepted for business transactions instead of HODLing, this experiment could have a future.

What are "debt notes", and why do you use them?
