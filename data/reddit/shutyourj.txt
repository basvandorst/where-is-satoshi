Nope, proof of stake is a different way of establishing consensus on blocks on the block chain. LN is a way to make transactions off-chain, in a still trustless way that is secured by the underlying Bitcoin network.

I ran through the steps on this post the other day to test out LN transactions on the testnet and it was pretty amazing:  
Opening the channel is a transaction on the blockchain so it takes the usual fees and confirmation time. But the LN transactions after that are just about instantaneous (not exaggerating) and the fees are about 550 satoshis ($0.02) per LN transaction. Pretty amazing! If the experience IRL can be as seamless as that testnet demo, it's going to be huge.

Best way is to buy a hardware wallet like a [Trezor]( or a [Ledger Nano S]( They use cryptographically secure electronics to keep your private keys safe and off of your computer (which could be compromised by malware).
As a free alternative, you can use a software wallet like [Electrum]( which lets you control your private keys but that is more vulnerable to malware.
A final option is to use paper wallets that let you store bitcoin offline. They keep your private keys on a physical paper that you can then import into a software wallet at a later date to spend your bitcoins. These are nice for "cold storage" but they're still vulnerable to malware and compromise when you import the private keys into a software wallet.

I'm not certain what you mean by efficient. 
Hardware wallets keep your private keys off of your computer for their entire lifetime. This alone makes them more secure than a paper wallet, since paper wallet keys have to be loaded into a software wallet in order to spend the BTC stored on them. When you want to spend BTC from your hardware wallet, the transaction is signed on the hardware wallet device so the keys stay safe, off your computer.
Their obvious downside, on the other hand, is their cost. Only you can decide whether the decrease in risk of theft is worth the cost to you.

When storing coins on an exchange, there's always a chance that they could be hacked or shut down and cost you your coins. If possible, try to keep coins on your own privately controlled wallet unless you're actively trying to trade them.
As for where to store your coins, see my reply to OP for options.

And electrum doesn't support importing multibit wallets yet. It's not until the "soon to be released next version". Hope it's actually released soon...
