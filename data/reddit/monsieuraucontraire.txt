Do you honestly believe fractional-reserve banking is in the peoples best interest? I forget what the actual projection is, but there's billions of dollars in wealth on paper that truly doesn't exist in the real world because of it. This is false wealth masquerading as real which only exists in the aether of modern banking, and if that all collapses the FDIC won't be able to do shit to help the situation or the common folk. So you may have more short-term stability for a while, but the trade off is that when the apparatus does eventually come down it will be systemic and dire.

Not that this is the biggest surprise, but does go to explain why Linux users were being extra scrutinized seeing how unintentionally/intentionally avoiding such ploys flag as suspicious behavior.
Edit: a word

The pragmatic question for a business then is if a government agency approaches you acknowledging they have already infiltrated your system, whether zero day or other means, do you comply with establishing a backdoor to allow them access or not. The conflict being they're already in your system through exploits so would you rather control their access point, as much as possible, to be stable and known to you rather then having holes other malicious actors can also penetrate if discovered. Ofc that's assuming a backdoor is somehow "safer" or more controllable than a exploit in the wild, which isn't a good assumption here beyond just for the case of argument sakes.
