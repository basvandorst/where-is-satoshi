I'm an avid fan of both. Please keep me in the loop. Not sure if I'll be able to contribute technically, but I'd love to learn and am more than happy to try.
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:44:18
Yesss, keep going down so I can finally buy in.

I'll hit up Java after finishing Python lessons on CodeAcademy. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:29:38
Yes please!

Gone in less than a second. Too much frenzy for my blood. Thanks for doing this!

So basically EVE Online.
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:52:05
Awesome! Thanks for notice.

I'm concerned about the discrepancy between the BTC price listed when I go to deposit funds on Circle's website as well as the price listed when I google "btc price".
Can anyone explain?
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:58:47
Would highly recommend to get more forward thinkers thinking!
@_date: 2014-09-04 13:30:36
2 BTC is a hell of a lot more than $0.02.
@_date: 2014-11-02 20:14:27
So...how does this work?
@_date: 2014-07-17 13:50:55
Have it. Love it.
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:38:36
So really, even though Circle displays no "fees" for transactions, there certainly is one, close to 1% of current BTC price.

Organized and well stated. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-03-15 18:02:56
You're a rockstar.
@_date: 2016-03-15 13:05:34
Isn't one of the points of bitcoin/blockchain technology that third parties aren't so much random, but anonymous and verified/substantiated by the network itself?
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:48:18
Post 'em up!
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:57:51
I just threw in another $100. Ezpz.

Noob here, following bitcoin for years.
What is the purpose or benefit of running a node yourself?
@_date: 2016-03-15 13:04:38
So running a node increases the 'health,' so to speak, or at least the robustness, of the bitcoin system. Gotcha.
What do you mean by 'in [my] own network'?
@_date: 2016-03-15 13:25:13
Thank you for a good answer.
@_date: 2016-01-27 16:46:35
But that doesn't make for a catchy headline!

Pizza in nashua NH? Will post pics.
Grats on the rocky ride into BTC!

Not all ivy leaguers are drones, buddy.
@_date: 2015-10-25 13:19:09
Which version are you running, and do you have the install file? I kept one of the older installers through several reformats, but recently a buddy accidentally (grunble) updated it.
@_date: 2015-03-12 13:21:21
Not seeing the bitcoin option. Also, is this your site?
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:54:04
Please and thank you!
p.s. I LOVE Khan Academy. I have donated and will continue to do so. Nothing yet with bitcoin, but maybe it's time to start.
@_date: 2015-10-25 13:21:49
What news?
@_date: 2015-03-12 14:39:21
Derp, missed it. Thanks! This might actually get me spend some some BTC...
@_date: 2013-02-15 16:05:43
Done and done. Enjoy the links!
@_date: 2013-02-02 18:07:45
Shipping date estimate? Still a decent time to buy?
@_date: 2013-03-26 02:14:47
Should the subline read "You are *in* the right place..."?
@_date: 2013-01-26 19:56:15
Did you gather value by mining, trading, or what? I've been interested for a while, but finally have some time to hunker down and learn about bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-02-15 12:22:25
I'll bite, if you're still going.
@_date: 2013-03-07 06:45:58
How 'bout them apples?
Thank you!

@_date: 2013-01-31 17:44:30
What is the significance?
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:38:03
Thank you!
*edit* Oh no, I missed it :(
@_date: 2013-07-11 15:20:36
Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-02-08 17:08:57
Is this still going? I signed up but haven't verified yet; did not occur to me to check for referrals/acct bonuses before acting. Free currency is always good, and even better if I can help someone out as well.
@_date: 2013-02-10 03:02:49
The youtube mute button is godsend.
@_date: 2013-03-08 00:45:11
@_date: 2013-02-08 23:28:34
Are they still providing the free sign-up and/or referral bonuses?
@_date: 2013-03-24 06:23:09
I'd look into the metric system.
