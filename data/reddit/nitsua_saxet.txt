I trust my fart after a night at Taco Bell more than Libra.

They can’t. It’s always fear over fact.

There was a bubble in early 2013, which popped. Then it was followed by another bubble in late 2013. Not saying this kind of thing will happen now again for sure, but just saying that I don’t know if it’s predictable when the next run up will come.

It’s not knowing  who Satoshi is that counts, but it is the *spirit* of Satoshi within each and every one of us that matters.
Just kidding. Imposters suck. And it’d be hella cool to know who Satoshi is/was... but looking unlikely we will ever find out.

I guess because there will be in-person, authorized sellers of libra that will sell it. In developing countries, this will help bank the unbanked. This is one of their purported benefits, at least.

I emailed Bakkt about how to go through the process of settling in Bitcoin. They never got back to me. They don’t give a shit because either they assume I’m too small a fish (there’s no way they can know that), or they don’t want to encourage taking delivery.
They have no other way of contacting them. They strike me as shady. Not because they are some two bit scammers. I know they are legit. But the type of legit that is insidious.

You are wrong because I’ve benefited from crypto to the point of financial independence and I still recognize that social programs are important. Anything that can produce productive citizens, even if it’s help in the form of redistribution, is the least we can do as benefactors of society.
You didn’t get here by yourself and you know that. I agree we shouldn’t give everyone everything, but at least enough so that they can have a chance to fulfill their potential. Also, if one truly has certain beliefs, the amount of money one has shouldn’t ever cause those beliefs to change.

Leg and foot look computer-rendered.

It is frightening that this fiat experiment is not even older than some peoples’ lifetime.

When people rush to collect 32 eth to stake in ETH2.0, that might be an exception

David Letterman is king boomer. Even back then he was. Amazing how old minds cannot grasp new paradigms. (Not all, but many)

Seriously. People should give it a chance.
Also... apparently it’s a sham when it’s a token but when it involves bitcoin, all of a sudden it is interesting....
Bias showing much on such people?

There is an intentional, coordinated effort to shape the narrative. There is too much money at stake to not do that.

I mean, rootstock and lightning network were built on top of Bitcoin and are pretty solid.

I say we change the protocol so that all newly minted coins go to me.

You think they’ve heard of EthenolReum?

Where is it defined what “too fast” is? Is there a certain rate at which blocks should be created?
