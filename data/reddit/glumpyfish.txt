I feel you are taking software development too lightly. You don’t just need money and “good people”. You need good decisions and people you can trust, which can be an enormous feat that takes a huge amount of time especially for an important project.  I’m sure they feel a lot of pressure already and it doesn’t help to put more.

It’s totally ok, we are all learning.

First of all, if all currencies inflated, then bitcoin’s price would increase accordingly. Second, if you got 5mil, a lot of that would go right back into bitcoin and your govt would have spent a lot of money for a negative result.

If I recall, he was screaming because he was feeling bad for his rich buddies losing all their wealth. In retrospect, it was a rare and honest indicator that something was seriously wrong.

Well, stocks can split, so essentially you can.

Not gonna yell or downvote you. I know your sentiment is a common one but it always sounds strange to me since this hasn’t been my experience at all. In university I competed against many female engineers that were clearly smarter than me. I work with a few female software devs who are really good. The ppl I’ve met in person who have been most passionate about bitcoin have been women. I must live in a different plane of existence than you.

That’s all I have. The numbers don’t lie, it’s true. Just sharing a different perspective.
