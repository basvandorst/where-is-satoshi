They forgot one of the most important factors, the available circulating supply and cap structure. Just as you would not buy a stock with an over-sized float and poorly engineered cap table, neither should you do so with a crypto.

Ever heard anyone say "I don't care" and look away but they really do? Little kids do this all the time. Looking askance at something is also related. These kinds of human emotional or immature reactions to another's positive outcome are breeding grounds for envy.

Think of this as a form of envy based on their tardiness, lazyness to understand the technical concepts or financial concepts or an opp for arbitrage. You can also think of it as an evolutionary branch of the human race being left behind that are in complete denial because they chose not to advance.

Top billionaires are mostly technologists including Larry Ellison.
It's ok to not invest in what you don't 'understand' however, if you don't understand something, how does that give you the understanding to advise others to not invest in something you do not understand?
Where does the Google 'owning most of bitcoin' reference come from?

Can anyone help? I need to tell you how long a piece of string is, do you know?

This is valuable information that you are withholding from people. It's on your watch.

"I don't understand it" - Buffet. Ignored the entire technology sector which is now worth more Berkshire will ever be. Just ask Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Apple, Slim, Musk, Larry(Google), Sergey(Google), Ellison and the list goes on and on... He's a fool in disguise, a Jamie Dimon-type, compared to these guys.
Giving advice to people by telling not to invest in something "you don't understand" is equivalent to a form of stupidity. Protecting the value of a synthetic asset like Gold or Diamonds is desperate and devious. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:50:30
It is, just wait til they get on the crypto train. They've yet to learn that "if it swells you ride it" aka trade it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:33:50
It's amazing how Warren Buffet ignored the technology revolution and then became less important than Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Carlos Slim, Sergey and Larry etc. And if you have popcorn, watch r/wallstreetbets and especially r/robinhood follow the same path along with VCs at Y-com and Silicon Valley and such. NY and SV are being disrupted to the core, blindsided. 
Edit: Famous buffet quote "I don't understand it but I would not advise to invest in it." Makes no sense. Let me just go to MacDonalds and order another EggMacMuffin instead of doing the work the Microsoft founders, Google or Apple founders did. Bye bye Jamie Dimon.

I'll be a bit less bullish when naked shorting comes in, synthetic sell pressure aka derivatives aka futures. A bit less, the old school financial thought process is now history. It's adapt or die for Jamie Dimon types. Apple controls the music labels just like decentralization will control finance now. I'm bullish like Buffet should have been on the Internet.

A 0.618 retrace is ideal until crypto winter and black swan event occur. Have fun at a 0.382/4 retrace if you have thick skin. Otherwise, if it swells, ride it.

So get used to collecting data accurately before making assumptions and blanket statements regarding something you obviously did not read thoroughly. Then try applying Bayesian statistical methods to the financial markets get back to us quants on how well you do.

I'll admit I've just recently applied correlation matrix datasets in a small family office mainly because I'm an investor and friends with the founders of the company that wrote the article. As I have vested interest in their outcome I tend to defend them too. They work in 'information arbitrage' which is beyond sentiment analysis for providing signal according to what I've found. I agree with your points above.
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:16:18
You really need to accurately determine where your initial bias was rooted from. Do that, then we can continue.

"In May, the Swiss bank UBS said it was moving 80 staff into a new artificial-intelligence division, dubbed the Strategic Development Lab, which is dedicated to defending its fixed-income trading turf against hungry fintech startups.
Later the same month Deutsche Börse, the German stock exchange, said it had earmarked €270m for investment in big data analysis, blockchain, robotics and AI.
Meanwhile, the City Corporation’s top envoy to the EU, Jeremy Browne, said late last month that he thinks AI will be more disruptive to UK financial firms than Brexit, in the long term.
Quant Insight and its backers are betting that banks and asset managers will also tap into new tech by buying in services like the one it offers. The analytics firm said it has grown customer numbers by 50% this year, and has added new staff to sell its services in Asia and the US.
It is also working with “major banks” on creating bespoke indexes and equity baskets — groups of stocks that share certain characteristics and are likely to move in a similar way in response to given macro events." (1)
