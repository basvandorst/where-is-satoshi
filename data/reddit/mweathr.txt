On the contrary, Bitcoin has a higher adoption rate in the BRIC countries than in the west. Russia especially.
Plus you're more likely to find vendors willing to accept alternative forms of payment in China. You just might have to do some convincing.

Agreed. Anyone who broke the encryption would not be interested in bitcoin, and they'd keep the fact they broke the encryption secret, so confidence in the encryption would not be affected.
Eventually some research lab would repeat the feat and publicise it, and everyone would switch to something quantum computers can't break easily.
It's extremely doubtful quantum computers would fall into the hands of someone who would use it against bitcoin before bitcoin had time to compensate, or quantim miners appear on the network.

Gains are gains, if I didn't realise them, my losses are no less real. I had $x in bitcoins, now I have $y in bitcoins, thus I have lost (or gained) the difference between x and y.

That's assuming every account needs manual verification. I'm sure if you provided enough information, the verification is automatic.
@_date: 2011-05-23 03:30:07
Yes, they do. To exploit it you need to mine. That gives you a vested interest. Given enough hardware, you can pull $x out of the market before destroying trust in bitcoin, or mine $y of bitcoins legitimately. So long as $y is more than $x, you have a vested interest in bitcoin's success. 
Even if you have external interests that would be harmed by bitcoin's success, the more profitable route is still to mine legitimately. If bitcoin fails, you spent no more than you would have if you attacked, and if it succeeds, then your holdings in the bitcoin market most likely far exceed any external losses.
That doesn't rule out attacks motivated by ideology, of course. An eccentric billionaire, or a government entity could still attack.

I've been able to get every GPU miner available (at least, that I knwo of) to run on linux. Read up on how to compile C and C++ programs (usually just ./configre &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install after installing the relevant -dev packages), download whatever miner your chosen pool supports, and compile it.
If you don't want to/cant figure out how to compile, try the Diablo miner. It's java, so it should just work.

You can't auto-correct for the cure for cancer. There would be no more proteins to fold. It's been cured. You'd need to tie the value of the bitcoin to something else, and get all clients to agree. If you want an autocorrect, then you would have to make the clients do useless work because by definition increasing the difficulty of a calculation arbitrarily is useless work.
Right now, it's calculating transactions + useless work. What you're proposing is calculating transactions+ curing cancer + useless work. If you maintain a certain bitcoin generation speed, you must add or remove useless work. Eventually, most of the work is going to be useless no matter what you base it on, so you may as well base in on something you won't have to change.

The original argument is that it would be more profitable to work for the system than against it, and this only reinforces that. By working against it you only damage your own interests. There is a finite amount of money you can pull from the system before people notice and bail out. There is a much larger amount to be made if you simply mined legitimately with the hardware instead.
Anyone with a vested interest in seeing bitcoin fail would have to stand to gain more than they lose by not simply legitimately cornering the bitcoin market. There are no current financial players that wouldn't be considerably better off if everyone switched to bitcoin and they had already cornered the market. And if nobody switches, then they are no worse off than if they destroyed it.

I'd rather lose my thumb drive when mugged than lose my thumb.

I doubt there will be no new articles in a month. As the bubble grows, more articles come out. It's a feedback loop. Eventually we'll hit a peak in coverage, but the media is far from finished with bitcoin. It'll really take off when a prominent "think of the children" group comes out against it because little Timmy can buy drugs, porn and hookers with bitcoins.
And it's entirely likely that the bubble could go on long enough that real demand could grow enough so that the crash still keeps bitcoin value much higher than today's prices.

These aren't temporary fluctuations, the long-term trend is up, and it's likely to stay that way for quite a while. The media has only begun to flog this horse. It's not even dead yet.

You think you're a well known economist?

Nvidia cards are better at floating point math. ATI is better at fixed point math. Fixed point is what you need for hashing.

I believe in banding together and subjugating the self-independent, but the government won't let me :(

Can I interest you in a rock that repels tigers? I've had it for 2 months and haven't been attacked by a tiger yet.
