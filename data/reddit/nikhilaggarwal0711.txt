By the time they will figure it out.. they would require your public key as well.. and enough time for you to transfer funds.. 
No cyber expert is going to break in your home.. and steal keys.. Practically.. thats a rarest of rare event..

Consider some CRUCIAL points from government perspective as well : 
1. it is known that Bitcoin price is handled by whales (How, I don't know) .. so Government would never like to see money flowing out of their country.. as it can destroy the economy as well.
2. they cannot trust any technology blindly... as it is going to decide the fate of billions.
3. They cannot completely rely on any technology where money is involved
4. Don't forget, all critical documents of government are still being signed on paper.. why can't they digitally sign those ? .. as technology cannot be trusted completely...
Governments will eventually move over this technology and that will take time.. so be a HODLer.. :)

I agree with you. But consider points which I tried to make: 1.) This is for common users who have no idea about encryption and computers 2.) Robbery at home is rare event 3.) small investors 
... in the rare case of robbery only your keys are exposed... are robbers so clever enough to steal a piece of paper ? .. if they are.. can they literally crack it ? ...sometimes simple encryption is hard to decrypt rather than making it complex for yourself.

Just to make it a bit difficult for robbers.. practically robbery is rare event and no computer expert is going to sneak in ur home... 
also they would require yiur public key.. which is not available.. think practically..

To stop people investing in btc , gov will try to
1. take control on exchanges .. 
2. but how will they control decentralised exchanges .. blocking ips through ISPs? .. probably yes .. 
This will block a huge portion of money flowing in from small investors... but this will not bring down the whole tree ... its like cutting it branches 
they cant shutdown internet from running code ..

Most of the projects on blockchain will be getting completed by the end of 2018 .. and will come in mass adoption by 2019... this year gonna be huge and now is the last and best time to get into crypto this cheap.. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:20:39
coz money which was flowing into cryptos was never high like this before .. nobody expected that it will grow like this in a year alone..

I agree with you on that. But for regular users "Shamir Key Sharing" is difficult to understand. Methods which I shared are for everyone who has not invested millions. People are more happy keeping keys at home so they can use this way to add more security. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:53:28
will make series on same.. really appreciate your suggestions.. :) 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:40:15
Agree... but we should not skip the MOST CRITICAL aspect .. 
1. it is known that Bitcoin price is handled by whales (How, I don't know) .. so Government would never like to see money flowing out of their country.. as it can destroy the economy as well.
2. they cannot trust any technology blindly... as it is going to decide fate of billions.
3. They cannot completey rely on any technology where money is involved
4. Dont forget, all critical documents of government are still being signed on paper.. why cant they digitally sign those ? .. as technology cannot be trusted completely...

how Adhaar will change the face of India, you are surely not aware of it... would suggest you read about adhaar..
majority of people are using Crypto only to make money.... that's why converting fiat to btc ban will disrupt the price... but it cannot disrupt the technology...

Bitcoin is much like "The Undertaker" ... hope you get what I meant... :)

Thats the prob.. blockchain has 1000+ projects .. why we always consider bitcoin to solve all prob ? ... give a thought on this bro..

In December,2017 -  my friend told me that he cannot afford to buy even 1 BTC now......
In March, 2018 -  the same friend told me that he can afford now but Bitcoin will not recover from here.......
In December, 2018 -  the same friend will tell me that he cannot even afford 0.1BTC now. :D

2 thing that can take you on moon in crypto world is : Research about hidden gems and HODL those gems.
