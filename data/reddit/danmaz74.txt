Hey, I just cooked up this daily adoption chart: 
Crude but it does its simple work :)
@_date: 2017-02-04 11:15:55
For those who want to track adoption, I quickly set up this chart: 
Let's hope for the best :)

Thanks for the info; I knew about the spread, need to check better the daily overnight interest.
But AFAIK for now it's the only way to get negative exposure to BCH; do you know any alternative?

I know it's not a "real" short, but who cares? By the way, why "very expensive"?

Update: yesterday the buy wall at 280 was removed, but a new one was added at 250. Right now the price difference with finex is more than 30%!

Compared to Bitfinex, Bittrex and most other exchanges, the BCH price on Kraken is 50 USD (25%) higher. There is a buy wall at 280 USD, but people who don't sell now their BCH there are in for a very bad surprise as soon as deposits will be open or shorting will be allowed there... just an alert.

It doesn't go both ways, because those who want to *buy* BCH can move their BTC to Kraken or some other exchange with an active market, and buy. Those who want to *sell* BCH instead... they can't do anything for now, unless they got their BCH on one of those exchanges.

np; finex is an outlier at the moment because they will credit you BCH but NOT on BTC held on margin; because of this, a ton of people moved their BTC there and then shorted the same amount, becoming market neutral - this way they can get their BCH with 0 market risk. That's why loaning BTC is so cheap.

In short: a BTC you hold on Kraken will give you, after the fork, 1 BTC and 1 BCH. A BTC you hold on Coinbase will give you, after the fork, 1 BTC and 0 BCH. So, right before the fork, the price of BTC on Kraken should be equal to the price on Coinbase + the market price of 1 BCH.

Yes, they're not so stupid and the accounting will be fine.
What I'm wondering, instead, is how these (currently) 42,000 BTC shorts will affect the market in the next days on finex. Shorters will need to close their shorts before being able to move their BTC; will this create a big buy pressure? Or will they all move very slowly to keep that in check?

I'm trying to use this information to estimate the market expected price of BCC/BCH before the split, here: 
Have you got any idea if they will announce a policy about the generated BitcoinCash before the split? Considering their volume re BTC/USDT, I would really like to use their data, but this uncertanty makes it very difficult...

Lending rates on finex are much lower than on polo, around 0.7% last time I checked...

Usually, the differences between these exchange are close to 0 (if you correct for USDT). Any significant difference right before the fork, when you aren't aren't able to move your BTC to your wallet in time for the fork, should reflect that significant event.
Of course, assuming that the markets are rational enough...
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:58:50
... or you bought back after the dip and didn't miss the opportunity to actually triple your money...

If what happened with LTC SegWit is any indication, expect huge manipulations of signaling in the next few days. Very easy way to make huge amounts of money for miners.

Buy the rumor, sell the news...
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:49:11
For the market in general, yes. But for example, I would expect arbitrageurs to be pretty rational...
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:03:46
This is a real shame IMHO. A much better alternative to the rampant spam there would have been to limit new accounts and use a reputation system...
