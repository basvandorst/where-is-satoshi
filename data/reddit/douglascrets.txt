I side with this story as well. I don't see a monopoly and I don't see exploitation. I see them trying to manage the flow of BTC and to ensure reserves, just like a central bank that suggests the rising of interest rates to stem outflows of its currency, a la China's PBOC.

Please explain? For a n00b like me, friend. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 07:29:43
Do you think that they are doing this to create an insurance cushion the way a bank would have reserves in case of fraud, market failures, or stress on the financial system due to thefts and / or hacking?

I think it's interesting that someone stole all the Bitcoin but mostly people are mad at the exchange. Why no anger at the thief? 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:42:56
The financing by banks, if true, would not be the reason. any time you are plugging an API into the banking system, so to speak, you need to play with the banks by paying finance charges. That's just a given. 
I don't like that anymore than you do, but that's how the system works, and if Bitcoin is going to be a replacement system or an augmentation, you can't get around the fact that the borders between banks and transaction-bearing people is going to be solved through the fees system.

Even if they could, they wouldn't have done that. There would be no way that financial regulators, or even their own board, would have let them raise emergency funds in a public issue, whether a bond, a stock issue, or blockchain. 
They faced subversion with their own trading practices. The only way they would have been made whole was through emergency cash infusion from the government.

Isn't it pretty clear to everyone that Bitcoin is love beta with high delta and lots of risk? This anger about the loss is of course warranted but it seems tinged with a political bias that Bitcoin providers or exchanges should be nearly as "infallible" as banks. Maybe because of the libertarian mythology that anything as bureaucratically organized as a central bank is de facto bad?

@_date: 2016-08-08 03:07:26
But this is different. I think the fundamental point I am trying to make is that blockchain is held at an arm's distance by financial regulators, even though several leading investment banks are looking into it, and even though several hedge funds are trading BTC actively.
It would be fundamentally new if instead of a share you release on a public exchange, you can give "consumers" outside of the company the same access to equity as one might have if he invested in a startup. 
Essentially, this creates a new class of voting shares, and a new pathway for innovation funding that is transparent.
Of course, as you say, "this is nothing new." Well, okay.
But isn't the current struggle to get mainstream adoption to keep Bitcoin or blockchain from being a fringe element?
That's the point. It's not the making money part of it, or the financial vehicle part of it. 
It's introducing blockchain into the society in a way that keeps it from looking like some navel-gazing engineer's dream.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:59:18
The problem is that a decentralized market system doesn't have a central bank or an intermediary banking system from which it can take insurance funds to cover its losses.
As I said before, you live by the BTC, you die by the BTC hack. All of this stuff is in beta, no matter how rigorous the engineering. 
Engineering can't replace market / capitalism and banking practices. And essentially what you are seeing is what happens when you go far to the left of the system; you lose sight and lack any of the fundamentals.

I appreciate your response. When I posted about this earlier last night, Philippines time, I suspected that the rise in fees is about growth and about creating an insurance cushion. 
Do you think that companies like Coinbase are going to have to re-create a financial system from scratch? I mean, one that doesn't quite connect to the Central Bank-run financial system that exists, but that functions like one, but for the digital currency financial system, with intermediaries, regulators of its own, etc.? Hope that makes sense. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 08:59:43
Please don't make assumptions about my state of mind. Me saying that they would provide a insurance cushion is not the same as "feeling" like they are insolvent. I don't trunk or feel that way. You do. Let's not confuse things. Where is your proof? Intuition isn't a fact.

But removing trust doesn't mean you make the situation more anxious by not being able to trust someone. The idea of "removing" or "decentralisation" of trust is that you no longer pay for the trust brand of a bank, say, which assigns workers and ledger domination and scrutiny to the processing of your financial assets. 
Trust removal in this case does not mean everything is topsy turvy and murky. It means it's to a degree automated and handled by algorithms and cryptography. Or so I am led to believe.

Well, he's right you know. At the end of the day, Bitcoin is not about and only about the developers, though they are the ones that built it and sent it out in the "hello, world." At the end of the day it's about the people who need to use and want to use bitcoin and the blockchain. 
Make that hard for them and make it so that they can't trust you, and then you have a huge problem on your hands. Insecure geeks.

I really think that in order for anyone to accurately guess (and you can do no more than guess) what the PBOC has in mind, it's worth your time to investigate and read up on the China banking system and the financial efforts to build a consumer lending and financing infrastructure in China.
I really doubt very much that people in the PBOC are threatened or scared of bitcoin. And I do highly doubt that bitcoin can be an alternative to fiat in the long run, nor do I believe it's destiny is to smash central banks or replace the gold as a reserve or risk manager.
I do think, however, that bitcoin and blockchain present opportunities for a fast-changing financial system that the Chinese Communist Party wants to see accommodate the needs of a growing middle class and those people moving from cash to cashless.

You are quite right. I did some further reading and on bloomberg I noticed that the same yuan strengthening happened precisely a year ago. So it seems to me now that the Chinese knew their history and decided it was inevitable that China PBOC wold intervene again, almost as an anniversary.

For someone who doesn't seem to think marketing is necessary, you are leaning on all of the rhetorical infrastructure that builds marketing.
I like how you are reading a bias that I want bitcoin to succeed so that I (or anyone else) makes money.
In fact, my point about really good marketing is the opposite of using that as a manipulative tool.
You are talking about advertising, which is not marketing. 
Advertising is a tool set that is used to deploy the background and the narrative built up by marketing.
And often what happens in advertising is a mistranslation of what is learned and deployed in marketing.
I am saying that bitcoin has use value for people. It is not being explained properly. 
Bitcoin is not (if you want other humans to use it to escape tyranny of monetary policy) the tool that enables them to do so. People don't care about that. People care about what can this bitcoin do for me and for others. 
Marketing tells that story.
It's no surprise to me that bitcoin is not widely used. Most of the people I have met in the bitcoin world are so against things like marketing, and so extreme in their views of what will cure society's ills, that they miss the point entirely that more people using bitcoin actually helps them reach their extremist views, if not helps them reach that practical situation.

@_date: 2016-12-28 14:03:15
What does this mean 
@_date: 2016-12-27 09:19:22
I'm saying that if anecdotes here are to be believed, it's just bots trading bitcoin to themselves, using prices, any prices. I am not saying that the prices have to be that wildly inflated. After all, it seems that the prices are naturally higher in some cases in China than they are. I am saying that the volume increases in buying give the illusion that there is a manic need for Bitcoin, which fits well into the "constraints on capital outflows" story that floats around the news about China. 
It fits a narrative. It may not actually be true, but the result is that the bitcoin prices rise, because more people are buying it off of information that is fragmented. 
Nobody outside of China really understands China or the market in China. Certainly there are opportunities to leanr more. 
But when the news starts reporting that Bitcoin price is rising because the Chinese are buying more Bitcoin to escape capital constraints on their money, I have to kind of chuckle. Because who has the proof that this is true? 
@_date: 2016-12-27 10:04:12
I don't know. I'm limited by what I see and work in. I am mostly in China and trade in CNY and BTC / USD
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:05:26
This can't possibly be the reason. For one, China has had currency controls levied against its people for months. If this was truly creating tremendous or increasing amounts of pressure (which you would falsely think, because media writes headlines that suggest iterations of progressing pressure, in order to sell headlines), then that pressure would have already created that dramatic upturn in bitcoin. It has not. 
You can't depend on what you read in the news to be the basis for the interpretation. Because news is usually 1/4 of the story. The other parts of the story don't really get told, or the stories get told in such a way that they ignore the perceptions or ground truths that would make a story less streamlined or dramatic. 
Journalists love to pretend they write the truth. 
What they really write is a report on an agreed bias, and then they "scale" it through distribution, to make it seem like the truth.
I'm not being overly cynical. I just really believe you never know. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 09:50:48

Investing is risk. So are you suggesting that no investor would ever invest in anything that carried a risk? I mean, if they are that scared of risk then they are not really investors. If you think that safety is what attracts risk capital, then you probably are not of the type.
@_date: 2016-12-27 09:04:40
thanks. I have tried doing that. Price is incorrect. It doesn't reflect BTCC's own price in USD terms. Not sure I can trust it. In any case, I got this:  
@_date: 2016-12-19 06:35:02
What is the phrase mean. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 05:48:21
This was also true for a time at BTCC, where you could buy on the dollar spot exchange some BTC for about $45-60 cheaper than it was being sold or bought on Coinbase, or any of the American exchanges, according to data on tickers. 
Once the PBOC levied some regulatory statements against Chinese exchanges, this became harder to do, because volume dried up and you couldn't buy BTC at any limit price, forcing you to buy it at a high mark up  (but still cheaper comparatively). 
It's not as beneficial anymore, but you could look at Chinese exchanges, and if things change there is another opportunity there.

@_date: 2016-12-25 10:13:32
I agree. I kind of fall to the "it's a big bitcoin circus." I think that media outlets and news orgs try to display the most rational and reasonable story, even if it's false. Not because they know the truth, but because they have to protect their credibility. And this is the narrative that people are most likely going to digest and then walk away from, AND continue to trust the media source. 
Reporting on tv is not about reporting -- which should be about finding a real truth and broadcasting it, even if it feels really uncomfortable.
Journalism today is about gaining readers or not alienating readers. So that's the narrative you really see in between the lines.

@_date: 2016-12-27 08:13:47
You're not understanding what I am saying. I am saying that Chinese buyers and sellers on Chinese exchanges are seeing how "mispriced" non-Chinese exchanges are, and they are manipulating the China side to create the illusion of huge volume, which triggers buying in the non-Chinese market, which in turn creates more BTC arbitrage opportunities for people in the Chinese market, and creates waves of buying in Western markets.
I stand by my assertion (maybe I'm stupidly naive) that BTC price rises are not due to the common news events we see depicted here. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 07:56:31
Who says I didn't? 
@_date: 2016-12-27 07:55:53
It's not a huge buying swell from these countries. Trade happens both ways. You can't say arbitrage can only always exist in one direction. I do not think that all the buzz you are hearing in the news is what is really driving bitcoin price to rise.

commodity prices were largely already down, but speculation in China itself has led to many commodities enjoying some peak pricing and then collapsing. I am less confident that downgrade is causing "collapse" and more sure that it's likely just boom and bust speculation that has been going on for months.

The spot exchange on the China side is listing the market price of bitcoin as over $40 lower than the average price on any US exchange. So I just buy there, and move it over to my US account.

I would be more than willing to be paid for my expertise in marketing. I have had some conversations with people, lately, who seem to be interested. But as far as I can tell, they are unwilling to take the risk; they don't know what they want; or they are confused by what happens if they do have successful marketing. 
There is interest there. Perhaps a team needs to come together to create the first attempts at it. I have a team in Bangkok, New York and here in Hong Kong, and I have dozens of fishing lines in the water in beijing.

STill doesn't satisfy my need. It still lists BTCC in Chinese Yuan, not in USD. Please read the question. I need help finding BTCC listed in USD in a live tracker. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 08:31:55
It also doesn't do that. If you tap on it, it only converts to BTC to LTC and LTC to CNY. Nothing to USD. BTCC has two exchanges, really. One that let's you use USD and the other letting you use CNY, for people with China-based bank accounts. However, no third party chart enables you to look at any Chinese exchange in USD terms. 
I've looked pretty hard, and can't find anything that does this.

That's not what I am talking about. The rises in volume create a volatile situation when the trading begins. 
I am not using arbitrage in the classic finance sense. I am saying that the exchanges are all priced differently. 
When the volume swells in the buy side, the prices increase. 
The volume swelling is triggered by manipulated buying on Chinese exchanges. 
Stop trying to connect the two as if there is someone in China trying to buy in the US.
What I am saying is that it benefits Chinese miners and buyers and sellers to manipulate the buying volume, which triggers speculation buying in US and western markets, which triggers rises in the BTC price there, which in turn triggers people to say that Bitcoin is being adopted in Venezuala and India, therefore, Bitcoin is legitimate.
All i am syaing is that the bitcoin market is a manipulated market and that the common stories you hear in the news are NOT what is causing bitcoin to rise in price. 
Manipulation is. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 04:55:17
My strategy is continual buys on different exchanges where I find discounts and then sell one or two when I hit peaks. Then I buy back and accumulate as the price creeps up again. Like a brah.

I agree. My thinking process is that since it has taken a while to reach this stable level, it will be good to see it continue that pace and achieve that dynamic. Not sure we can count on it always being slow, but tests of the price levels don't necessarily mean it will never get there.

This is a concise way of saying what i was trying to say. Evangelism, certainly. I am trying to say that the whole suite of Bitcoin's transformative effort is going to help everyone.

The irony is that folks think that sovereignty and having no government intrusion is what is going to make bitcoin "moon" as you say.

In my humble opinion, CNBC and outlets like that are just mashing a template of what they know or predict against something they don't understand. I'm not saying I understand bitcoin, but if you just watch human behavior (and I live in China and I have traveled extensively and worked in India, for example), the actual ground behavior doesn't look anything like what the CNBC copy writers are sewing together through online search and calling up their rolodex.

Seeing it at TCP/IP only is sort of short-sighted, don't you think? Bitcoin is not about engineering, in the end.

Even engineering needs a human narrative.

@_date: 2016-09-05 05:36:25
The Fed certainly had nothing to do with Bitcoin pricing, and neither does most of what is going on in the financial markets. I think we need to spend less time trying to show everyone what is causing price rises and spend more time making really good, efficient market protocols.

If the currency devaluation in China was the reason that Bitcoin was rising in price, then this would not also be true -- China is defending the yuan against devaluation. 
Since this currency defense started, a few days ago, the value of Bitcoin has increased steadily. I would again argue, as I usually do, that financial market changes are not at all correlated to this very insular market called Bitcoin.

This is exactly my point. 
It's utterly ridiculous to assume that the world doesn't value, nor does it pay for, concepts, ideas, intellectual property, services, and not some before the flood, Noah's ark concept of value only being something that is a tangible good.
Ideas that support bitcoin that seem to suggest that things like debt are bad, or that anything not tangible are bad and the reason why the financial world is collapsing are just so far beyond what is true to economics, that one has to wonder why anyone thinks that supporting such arguments are bringing any benefit to bitcoin. 
Value is something that many people assign to anything. 
It just doesn't have to be something you put in your pocket.

Adding that on the web Coinbase is showing the price to be $615, but in the iOS app it is showing the price to be US$608.35. So what price is the basis price for buy and sell, regardless of any arbitrage or whatever?
So confusing.
If this kind of mispricing was happening on a public exchange like NASDAQ or with LIBOR it would be considered illegal or stopped until it was fixed.

Bitcoin as a currency won't really be tied up if a fund invests in Bitcoin. Just like currency being traded in an ETF isn't "tied up." 
@_date: 2016-07-26 14:01:32
I'm certainly not a professional, and I am not at all trying to cause a flame war, but really what else do you expect from people working on contracts and transactions? There is no technical solution to human behavior in a market. In fact, in my opinion human behavior and all it's vagaries, is precisely what makes a market what it is. Taking that out of a market takes away all of the opportunities to leverage insight and greed or fear in order to make money or create trust, for that matter. 
Perhaps a philosophical argument, but a clear one that drives economics, in any case. No?
