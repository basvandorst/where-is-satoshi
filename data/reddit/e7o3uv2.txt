1. Your website should be HTTPS only. Even if you're still in beta having an HTTP website looks unprofessional.
2. It appears like your company is good on the tech side but really comes across as having no business skills and really naive about the legal and business arrangements it will take to make this actually succeed. Without hiring an experienced CEO that can handle those aspects I doubt you will be successful. Just my opinion.
3. KYC/AML makes this pretty much useless. Why give you all my documents and have you track my purchases plus risk you getting hacked? Might as well just use a credit card.

You haven't really explained how the system works. You said it uses HCE, so basically you're creating virtual credit cards? Is it one credit card per user? So merchants can track your purchases? Who is the bank issuing the VCCs? At some point you need to have an agreement with MC/Visa or have an agreement with someone that does, so who is it?

What is the point of submitting a support ticket? Just use your own onion site sometime, this issue happens all the time and it will be easy for you to reproduce.

Give up your anonymity in other words. If we didn't care about privacy why would we be using the onion site in the first place? This is not even a workaround.

Agreed, the scalability definitely needs to be fixed. But at this point the tests are doing nothing to help that. Scalability was the most widely debated development issue before these tests and it's the whole focus of a conference this week. If the goal of the tests was to prove that scalability needs to be addressed, they met that goal a long time ago.
It's like beating somebody up to prove they need to learn self-defense. A valid point the first time you do it but beating them up over and over again while they are already enrolled in self-defense classes serves no purpose. You're just beating them up for your own reasons at that point.

Actually I know what the cause is. You bound the onion web server to a local IP (127.0.0.1) and your app sees that IP for every request to the onion web server. And so the rate limit goes into effect. Solution: ignore the local IP in the rate limiter.

You don't. Blockchain needs to.
