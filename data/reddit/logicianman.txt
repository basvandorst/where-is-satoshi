**How much would it cost to own over half the network and launch a 51% attack? Answer: $11 million**
The KnCMiner Neptune does 6000 GH/s.
If you do the arithmatic, to control 51% of the network (101% of the current network hash rate), you would need 10,980 KnCMiner Neptune miners.
Now KnC sell them for $9995, however the actual cost to make these is far less. I was going to research it myself, but I found some one who had already done so recently. He estimated the cost at roughly $1000 per rig, and that includes labor costs.
10980 x 1000 = $10,980,000
There are two other factors you might raise against this: Electricity and manufacturing capacity.
The electricity required would be 23 MwH - or enough to power approximately 5000 US residential homes. The cost on the other hand wouldn't be much of a problem - it would only cost $2,300 per hour to run even at the average US residential rate.
Manufacturing capacity would also be a problem, but I doubt it would take much to ramp it up to large-scale production and thus at speed. A small outfit like KnC is already slated to output over a thousand per batch, so making a batch of 11,000 is well within the realm of possibility (I.e. having many different manufacturing outfits working on the same thing).
And in regards to the issue of electricity supply, the machines could be distributed across different areas, as they are now. The use of a few industrial warehouses should be sufficient.
So much for the 'hundreds of millions' or 'billions' figures we keep having parroted at us.
