That explains why i couldn't get it, i thought softfork made more sense for the first one

It is if you try using it to eat with

Where are you getting the error, Bitcoin core?

It does clarify some things, though I'm struggling with how the +5 fits into it.

Thanks, there was obviously something up with the XOR websites I was using, they all gave the same wrong value.

Open Bitcoin core, Help -&gt; Debug Window -&gt; console , in the console type 
dumpprivkey address
where address is the address you sent funds too. Now copy the private key it gives you. Download Electrum and either create a wallet using that private key, or let Electrum generate a wallet for you and import/sweep the private key.

Have you ever seen/used MasterCard SecureCode when using the card on other websites? If not then your card/bank most likely doesn't support it, but you may want to ask your bank about MasterCard SecureCode in particular, rather than 3D secure. If there isn't support then your only option is to find a bank/card provider that does offer it. It may be possible to use a virtual card (Entropay / Neteller Net+ etc), but I don't know enough to say that that would definitely work, so you would need to do your own research on that.

So you don't have to worry about any extra fees it is probably better just to create a wallet using the key for the moment, in Electrum click File -&gt; New/Restore -&gt; give it a name -&gt; Standard Wallet -&gt; Use Public or Private keys
In the text box paste the private key you got from Bitcoin core and click next, now you can give it a password (optional but recommended) , click next and you are done.
Edit : Nevermind, just saw your edit, you're welcome

I may be wrong but I don't think this is something you get any choice in, your bank either supports it or not. What type of card is it (Visa/Mastercard etc) and what country are you in?

I was actually using that site. Looking back at the values given, my ROT-5 value starts to differ after about 30 chars, so that's where the problem was. Trying using a different ROT-5 decoder gives the required string.

The address that you sent the funds too from coinbase

What exact values did you get? because I had tried to XOR those values and whilst I got a few ASCII chars I definitely didn't get enough for a private key.

I would doubt that is it, Wallet.dat should be under AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin
