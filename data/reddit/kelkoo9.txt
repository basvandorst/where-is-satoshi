Got it. I was debating on whether I should get the ledger nano s or the trezor, but went with trezor because of a $60 difference between the two. I'm sure they are both good wallets and will suffice for my needs. Thanks for your input.

Yeah. It's most likely the huge rise in demand for them. I got the trezor and it looks good. Just one question though. Do you use any mobile wallets to do like a watch-only for your trezor wallet or is that even possible? I know I can do it on the PC, but I'm not sure if I can do it on mobile wallets. Thanks!

It was like $159 on Amazon and Trezor was $93. Ledger website had like €30 shipping fee or something like that which made it about the same cost as Trezor from Amazon.

I haven't received it, but what you're saying is that as long as the packaging has not been tampered with, it's safe to use, right?

It says it's €89 on Trezor and adds €26 shipping fee. I bought my Trezor from Amazon for $93.

I had my bitcoins in breadwallet before Aug 1st and until yesterday. Last night, I sent my bitcoins to my Trezor and now I'm wondering what I'd do to access my BCH. 
1. Do I attempt to withdraw the BCH from Breadwallet (currently $0 balance) to an exchange like Shapeshift / Kraken? 
2. Do I have to withdraw the BCH from my trezor?
3. One final question: Is there a mobile wallet that I can use to set up a watch-only for my trezor?
Thanks in advance for the help.
