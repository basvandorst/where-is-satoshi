That would be a good addition, but I think that could be implemented as a separate Docker container. 
By limiting the extent of the Docker container to just building from source, the container and its build process can be easily verified as safe through the container's source code. And it keeps it single-purpose so users who already have bitcoind can download the bootstrap.dat file separately, either via torrent or when they launch the program.

So glad you did. Everytime I heard the name I couldn't help but think of something like this.

Thanks for this! I actually put together a [Docker image to build bitcoind]( and am actually working as we speak on a Docker container to build and run bitcoind on a Raspberry Pi 2 running Docker. I will post details on this when I can optimize the build and reduce the container size.
Personally, I think building bitcoind from source is better than grabbing the binaries from a repository, just in case they've been compromised.

It is, but then they keep buying it back in larger quantities. I can't see the harm in owning a large quantity right now, but the fact that they sell huge amounts in 1 go and that's where people (or bots) get panicky.

Nice find. I'll have to give that a try on my N7.

I use that same widget too! I have one for Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, and Camp BX.
For those who are wondering where it is, you can get it on the [Play Store here](

Same here. 
Supply and demand, people. The less there are, the better the price. Stop selling so soon!
