Bitcoin is the most durable and secure form of money we've ever seen - i highly encourage you read The Bitcoin Standard.  
Your fact regarding bitcoin ownership is dubious and often mis-cited.  This is likely the result of exchanges holding bitcoin in custody for customers.  1 address = not equal to 1 person.  For example, one of coinbases cold storage wallet may have 5000 BTC but those 5000 btc are owned by 50,000 different customers.  This is the problem with using exchanges as custodians to hold your money for you not a problem of bitcoin itself.  You cannot look at unique addresses and determine it's a 1:1 with people.
No form of money is perfect and un-corrupted.  Study game theory, people are always trying to take advantage of a system no matter how divine to personally profit.  This isn't unique to fiat, bitcoin, gold, etc..  BUT, bitcoin offers us the fundamentals to be the best form of money we've ever seen.  Secure, fungible, sovereign, fixed monetary policy, etc.

Once again, you're equating single bitcoin addresses to single persons.  Your logic is flawed.  
We're also very early into bitcoins existence so i don't know what your point is.  I believe less than 1% of people own bitcoins.  I wouldn't be concerned with distribution of wealth it's a meaningless metric when a technology is in it's infancy.
Where are those stats on USD distribution for comparison?  If you're going to make an argument that BTC is bad you should probably provide some context.

You're contradicting yourself constantly and constantly making assumptions that you cannot prove.  
Bitcoin IS the most democratic form of money we've seen hands down.  It's permissionless and 100% unique in that respect.  No one is stopping ANYONE from being their own bank.  Just because the other 99% of the world hasn't caught on yet doesn't mean it's not "democratized".
