Is this for real?  There is so much misinformation between these two subs, I'm just trying to find some semblance of truth.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:18:52
Fairly certain we have people in this subreddit who study everything except how to be humble.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:24:30
Afaik, there is no such thing as paradigm with stuff like this...
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:22:36
That is about a month or two from now, maybe a bit later...
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:12:21
Where are you from?  I'm honestly curious.  Why do you feel so much hate?  How can I help?  I know my country is a shithole, and I'm sorry, I am doing what I can, which sadly isn't a lot because I'm mostly just afraid, I but I don't want to stop listening if you have things you'd like to say and have shared.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:11:29
And now I'd probably say the same thing about Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:23:32
The pop is happening more slowly because of alts.  It's still a pop - they just all have to go through BTC in the first place.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:37:41
Not yet.  But our complexity will eventually destroy us all.  Wait and see - personally, I'm on the edge of my seat.

That fucking mug...one of my coworkers stole mine a few years ago.  It makes me angry to think about it.  I had to wait months for that thing (along with my jalapeno similar to the one you show here)!  All I want is one of those mugs now.  It was so sad that by the time the unit showed up, mining difficulty had raised significantly due to all of BFL's "tests" and increased competition in the market.  haha, good times.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:08:58
Got it.  Where is this guy from again?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:08:58
He's much bigger.  On Bitcoin.  Than the other guy.  Ok seeya
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:15:47
Right.  They need to be useful, and stay useful in order to stick around.  This *is* a bubble, but I'm surprised you weren't banned for saying that.  lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:34:50


But it's not.  It's a disruptive technology.  People can say what they want.  Don't worry about it.  Slander/libel is only applicable to a human being.  Bitcoin can defend itself just fine...  =)
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:18:42


But what if their savings may crash in an hour and they just don't realize it?
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:53:37
Doubly so - Mark Karpeles makes my blood boil for doing this to gentle, kind, intelligent people like this poor man, assuming that was the hack being referred to.  Goddamn is this sad.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:22:12
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:20:54
Is the knife and pistol locked up near it?  If not, other people who know how to use those may employ your knife and (loaded?) pistol on you as they steal your fireproof safe.  Careful out there, stranger.
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:47:37
It's a different room now!  Ok, it changed again.  Really, are these walls made of construction paper?  What DID they put in this IV??
I know, I know, you were going a different direction with this.  Too bad.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:42:57
Then bubble pops to 3000.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:44:13
But...those 0-60 times...all the sweet technology in the cabin...the top end speed limit...and even the more practical stuff, like mpg equivalent, the 600 mile range, etc.  Hmmmmm.  Not just those types of people buying these.  No, those people would buy a Prius.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:40:54
Still a bubble.  It will grow, but patience is more than a virtue here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:12:24
Then I suppose the dark side of the moon would be my ex.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:37:31
Crypto homesteaders...I like that.  Perhaps there **should** be a subreddit for this.  Gotta have a family for real homesteading, though.  I am not so sure that will happen in my lifetime anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:15:47
Then none of this matters...

FYI: This exact situation that everyone is describing happened to me.  Partner of a decade (common law marriage in some states, not mine) went ape shit that I didn't pay off her debt and home mortgage when valuation of collection went to $450k last bubble.  She was not married to me.  She cheated on me with a friend who earned more money in his yearly salary.  The entire time it was my fault for not trying hard enough to get a better job.  I was only able to keep the coins during the MESSY breakup due to not being married.  Another best friend also got a divorce around the same time - the girls were "birds of a feather" and so cheated on their partners together.  I honestly think that best friend's feminist wife did much more damage than I initially anticipated she would.  It was the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen in my life; she never told me the truth, she just kept insinuating it, because she was non-confrontational as hell.  "You deserve better..." and "I'm just not attracted to you anymore."  This shit still gives me chills down my spine.  You men have no idea what women are capable of.  NO IDEA.  When they cheat shit gets fucked up for everyone.  Heed my warning or fucking live it, I don't care.
I NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD HAPPEN TO ME.  I was a good lover, partner, shared everything.  I thought this was the correct way to be.  She seemed like the best person I'd ever encountered in my life, and had only had a single partner before me.
Many of you guys are so unfortunately blinded by the ideals and concept of love that you don't understand this is a growing problem in this country.  Experience will teach you if she is given enough opportunities with wealthier, more charming men.  If you doubt this, you lack experience.  It's that simple.  Men who have experienced it from their partners may be assholes, but anyone is capable of being an asshole when discussions come down to money and there isn't consensus about decisions.
I believe society is degrading, destroying itself slowly.  I believed this before I ever touched bitcoin and it's the reason I believed in it so much to invest in it and not stocks with my money at the time, distrusting the common bank-based monetary system itself.  Because of this, I'm not putting it back into that system that I hate so fucking much.  And fuck anyone who doesn't process what the fuck is going on in the world today, you're absolutely ignorant to ignore our warnings.
