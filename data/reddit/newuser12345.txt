i call horseshit - Bitcoin is a proper noun, therefore should not be eligible for scrabble

i think it entirely depends on the circumstances. for certain things, yes absolutely, it helps encourage its use.
a house is a major purchase, one that most people probably dont want or cant afford to take a hit on 
if i had a coffee shop, all day every day with bitcoin happy hours ��

he HAS a buyer offering

i would probably try to negotiate a higher than asking price to take bitcoin for the sale, citing price fluctuations to justify it. 
this will be tricky unless your client is a fan of bitcoin to begin with. also depends on how much they owe on the property, because if a significant amount needs to convert to fiat immediately anyway, whats the point ?
would be super awesome though, make it happen

which is probably part of why the buyer wants to buy in btc and not just convert to cash

depends, maybe a little of both. ask one of those people that is buying lambos, or one of these experts writing the articles
my guess is it will go pretty high, then drop again, with a similar pattern as its shown most of its existence....
but theres a lot more variables now, comparative to  before, with a lot more to come. 
personally, my thing is i just dont see bitcoin going away, or doing anything other than becoming more valuable. with the value going up significantly once its all been mined, which will be soon.

im not sure how many people expected the floor to be 5k (or less ? )
but yeah, a lot of people did expect a pretty big correction
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:12:54
unpopular ? well, i guess the truth hurts...
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:49:59
well did anyone expect 1k to 20k in 2017 ?
its not that far fetched to be honest
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:51:31
i was thinking 3-5k but im not sure now that the senate hearing today went well
i was hoping for doom and gloom to drop the price, and those jerks were all positive and shit.
not sure we see 5k now
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:50:43
fair enough i agree with that.
