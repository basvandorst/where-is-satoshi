if you have your btc in your own wallet, you are responsible for it, otherwise the exchange is responsible. many exchanges have been hacked before and some customers lost all their money because of this


you can sell btc online via exchanges, or offline if you find someone who is willing to buy from you and pay with cash. but note that bitcoin transactions can take days or weeks at the moment because of the heavy load on the btc network. also transfering USD or EUR to exchanges will take a minimum of 2 days up to weeks because online exchanges are under heavy load also at the momen




there are different types of wallets with different levels of security, having your wallet on your phone is quite risky if you ask me. if you want to have a wallet on your phone because its easy to use i'd suggest you to not load all your funds into this wallet

Gdax is owned by coinbase. Go there, sign in. Transfer your fund from coinbase to Gdax(instantly) and it is free to withdraw BTC from Gdax.

cannot recomment coinbase because they seem to not manage the massive inflow of new customers very well. because of this support is close to non existent. withdrawals and deposits are heavily delayed and they actively try to harm bitcoin as a whole by not implementing segwit wallets and promotig bcash. unfortunately i dont have an alternative also, im from europe and use different exchanges than americans

what wallet?
choose your wallet from bitcoin.org
how to transfer?
go to coinbase, click send (or withdraw?) and put in your wallet's receiving address
Can I just send via the wallet code without charges?
sending btc always costs you a fee
if you have btc on coinbase, you can access your funds also on gdax, and some fees are much lower / non existent there

not satoshis but satoshis per byte. so multiply that by 240-300 (average transaction size in bytes)
