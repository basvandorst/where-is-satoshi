Not everyone who disagrees with the hivemind of this sub is a paid shill.

Does not mean he knew. A lot of people will not get into crypto because the price of 1btc is so high. This is the reason a lot of my irl friends won't get in, they can't see btc going to 60k+ any time soon. If adding a new coin with the same name, less tx fees, and less market cap will make new people get in through coinbase, of course they should want to do that as soon as possible.

I'm not a shill. I hold no BCH and wouldn't benefit at all from shilling. 
You cannot read, I never said they thought they needed to pay 60k to get in.
From purely a business perspective:
The company knew that one of the reasons people are resistant to BTC is because of the high price per coin. It might not be true that they need to get whole number of coins, but psychologically if you can only get a small amount if feels worse than getting a higher amount worth the same in fiat. If you have $10000 and someone tells you about bitcoin, and you can get either 0.5BTC or 3BCH, most uninformed people will choose the BCH.
The company knows that very rare that people buy &lt;$100 usd worth of btc because fees eat that up very fast, which reduces the pool of possible customers to people who have quite a lot of excess funds.
All companies aim to make money. Adding BCH was a good business move.
No need to be all insulting you fuckhead.
