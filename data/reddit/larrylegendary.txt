They're eventually going to open it up to other pools... but what is really important is the concept, the idea of embedded mining... if the model becomes successful, other companies will do it using new pools...

For one, it ubiquitously distributes the blockchain, increasing the network, creating greater computing power and stabilization.
Second, it could reduce costs since there will be profit sharing between retail consumers and manufacturers who will become members of a new mining pool.
Third, ownership will be established on the World Wide Ledger.
Fourth, it creates new ways for manufacturers to create smart products that can interact with the internet on its own.

Sending bitcoins, no matter how small, creates a transaction that will forever live on the World Wide Ledger. This transaction can be referred to from anywhere, anytime with the faith that it cannot be altered due to block chain technology.
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:35:12
No, from my understanding they are just manufacturing the chips. Their customers (cell phone/smart tv/smart car/etc. manufacturers) can then decide how to use the mining pool created by their product. These customers (Samsung? Tesla? Sony? etc.) in turn will be able to dictate how the profit from mining and transaction fees are distributed among themselves and their retail end user (us).

They also have that option. In addition, from my understanding, they also want to support 50 other currencies.

Price of devices could be subsidized by its mining capabilities. We could see the prices of cell phones, laptops, tablets drop as a result of their ability to make money for their manufacturers in the future...

Just because we don't have the capability now, there's no way to develop it in the future?!... C'mon have some faith...
Besides it seems they may be thinking of lumping/combining all of their transactions from the chips separately AND THEN putting it on the blockchain
@_date: 2015-09-22 15:44:49
Imagine a future where the cost of these chips become affordable enough to embed in most (if not all) devices around the globe... That would mean that each person would have a tiny amount of bitcoin to spend. Sure it may not seem like much for each individual person, but say you create a popular website or service that draws large numbers of users who each pay you a tiny amount of bitcoin... 
This creates a marketplace for new, innovative services that is run with bitcoin. That marketplace can only benefit bitcoin and increase the value of the network as a whole. It would really get the ball rolling and get people used to transacting in the cryptocurrency
It would also empower individuals to create new business models online that they could market to the entire world. Business models that take advantage of the micro transaction nature of the market...
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:13:51
For micro transactions
@_date: 2015-09-23 17:26:32
Well, from my understanding, that is what this Bitcoin computer addresses. The micro transactions wont be posted directly to the blockchain, they will first be bundled together by 21 Inc and then posted on the blockchain to minimize the transaction fees and make the micro payments feasible.
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:15:20
From my understanding, the mining chip has to do with micro transactions
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:56:39
I think it also facilitates micro transactions in such a way that makes economic sense (in terms of transaction fees)...
@_date: 2015-09-23 15:49:01
Before Bitcoin, it was impractical to send payments of really small amounts due to minimum transaction fees. But with Bitcoin, you will be able to send even fractions of a penny as payments. This will open up new business models that will cater to a large customer base using micro transactions. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 15:35:29
This isn't the end product. It's still very early in development. These products are marketed towards developers not end users. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 19:34:16
Yes but why would miners be interested in securing the network without the incentive that Bitcoin provides?
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:50:13
You're right. You are entitled to your opinion, no matter how much I or anyone else disagree with it... Still infuriating though because you write you as if your opinion is fact. Lol
@_date: 2015-09-22 21:25:18
If you can't think of any creative ways to utilize it, then this product really isn't meant for you. You need to wait for the developers/innovators to take this and create applications for the end user.
If everything goes according to 21 Inc's plans, there will come a time when a global marketplace exists where nearly everyone will have some Bitcoin (mass adoption) through the devices they buy. At this point you would definitely want to be a part of the network, just like you would definitely want to be connected to the internet.

Will this setup produce a steady stream of satoshis/bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-11-18 06:19:11
All this negativity towards 21 inc makes me feel like they are on to something. I just don't see people having such a strong reaction to something inconsequential otherwise.
@_date: 2016-10-15 13:05:16
No harm. No foul.
@_date: 2015-11-19 20:44:53
From my understanding 21 Inc is using their hardware to introduce a concept  called "buffered mining?" wherein the user automatically receives a steady stream of satoshis just by turning on their computer; essentially converting electricity into bitcoins. 
The service they are providing is to act as the "buffer" for mining payouts. Miners only get paid out when they win a block so the payouts are infrequent and somewhat unpredictable. 21 Inc has created a service where they shoulder the burden of waiting for these mining payouts while they supply their network of users with a guaranteed, however small, stream of satoshis. 
So while the arguments for creating your own setup using comparable parts does make some sense, it doesn't replicate the functions of the real thing. The real value they are marketing is the guaranteed stream of bitcoin you get as a participant on their network. And all you do is turn it on.
@_date: 2015-10-16 19:29:59
I'd want it to be fully automated/self-sustaining. I don't want to have to rely on people's honesty. I was thinking along the lines of "the internet of things" where these bathrooms are basically taking care of themselves after the initial setup.

It's like having two internets
@_date: 2015-11-18 17:01:32
So if 21 inc never opens it up, nobody will be able to tweak this device or similar design for their own pools?... The high initial cost of the device may be because now that it's out there, the cats out of the bag, and competition can catch up to this new idea.
@_date: 2015-11-14 05:59:37
You lose the benefits of the blockchain when you restrict it's participants.

How often do these mining pools payout? Is it a constant flow?
@_date: 2015-11-12 19:38:21
... as it is right now... Bitcoin continues to grow. It's really still in its infancy if you think about it. The more users that join the network, the more powerful it becomes.
@_date: 2015-11-17 15:10:37
21 inc is looking to address this decentralization concern.
@_date: 2015-11-18 02:21:54
This is easy enough for everyone in this subreddit, but for the purposes of mass adoption, do you really expect the average non technical person to follow those steps? This is a bridge to mass adoption.

I think he was trying to clarify the mining process and how it would continue to operate even after all bitcoins have been mined. Some people don't understand that mining also involves validating transactions.
@_date: 2015-11-12 17:41:13
The price will start to really move up when people start realizing that "blockchain technology" is really only as valuable as its network of participants. There really only needs to be one incredibly powerful blockchain that maintains the record keeping aspects of life on planet earth.
Edit: it's like having 2 internets. Just make one so everyone can contribute to it. And Bitcoin is the most logical choice at this point.
@_date: 2015-11-12 20:28:56

“Traditionally, the really smart people at MIT would graduate and go to Wall Street and exploit the inefficiencies of the financial process to make money,” Ito remarked. But, “the important thing about bitcoin is that the nerds that are working on it right now, my kids , they’re not really in it to make money. They’re in it to try to make the system work better”... I think this is spot on and very encouraging for the future 
@_date: 2015-11-19 22:51:08
The point is enabling a steady stream of bitcoin by doing nothing other than turning their device on. You don't have to set up wallets or manage private keys. Even if you created this with a RPi you wouldn't be able to achieve that steady stream of bitcoin because you are not participating in this new type of mining pool service they created. 
This service where new customers can instantly play with the bitcoin currency platform without investing any time or effort in setup, will open up new possibilities for bitcoin and its users.
