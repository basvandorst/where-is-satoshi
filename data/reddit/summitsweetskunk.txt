My knowledge of creating offline storage is almost a year old, but I thought using truecrypt was the de facto method for doing so. I was just a bit surprised in wasn't included in your initial list, glad to hear its going to be on the final distro!

Truecrypt? Is that still a thing? I hope so since I just secured some wallets inside of one!

Curiously ominous word choice since the next raids will likely be on openBazaar users.

Bitcoin doesn't offer any promise of 'justice', its not the goddam batman. If you want justice, why don't you go to Japan, kidnap Karpeles, and deliver him bound and gagged to the next bitcon convention?

My apologies, I didn't mean to offend the secret emperor of the Internet! At any rate, none of the other posts seemed to offer any answers as to why this is happening. Me asking if anyone else is seeing the same thing was really more of a rhetorical question, since I can tell from the blockchain that thousands of other addresses are affected.

I don't really know anything about law, but it seems like this was just the opinion of the prosecuting attorney, which would be understandably opposed to his release, and not any actual ruling by a judge.
That being said, his lifetime imprisonment is certainly one of the greatest affronts to justice we've seen in recent times. It should be appalling both to all of us in the crypto-community and those of us who are opposed to the war on drugs. I recommend everyone here go watch the documentary Deep Web, then head over to  and give whatever satoshis you can spare to help fight his cause.

As with any form of gambling, the house always has a slight advantage. People play because of the excitement involved, and the fact that you can occasionally walk away with more than you put in.

They're going to do btc &gt; USD but not USD &gt; btc? Sounds like PayPal wants to invest in btc if you ask me.

Exactly my point. We should consider every member of the bitcoin community to be only out for their own best interests. If I see btc guild as the best way to mine coins, then I'm going to use it. If you don't like that, don't make useless posts like this, go out and create a superior mining pool to get traffic away from btc guild.


My understanding was that bitcoin works without any trusted parties. From the bitcoin white paper:


allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third party.

My thought is you'd want a quadratic equation to best fit the the trendline. Here's the one I calculated, based on what I assume are previously stable prices:
y = 0.003x^2 + 1.2711x + 120.2042
Where y is the price of coins in USD and x is the number of days in the future. This would predict a price of $273 in 100 days, and $983 a year from now.
I can't wait to check back in a year and see if my assumptions are correct!

Since I started mining about 2 months ago, I've been to deepbit, mtred, and slush's, only to finally switch to btc guild last week after recent posts just like this. BTC guild simply has the best interface, the page loads quickly in the US, and it actually sends me notices when my miners go down. As soon as the other pools can duplicate this experience, I will switch back, but at this point if btc guild gets 51% they've earned it.
