Good point. I will check it out. Thanks so much. 


What constitutes knowingly withholding? Could they try to use that against me in this scenario in such a vague (and yet to be defined) area of tax law? I don't mind paying more in taxes, it's how tedious the process is for me, but that may change after I test out the website you provided. In fact, since I ended up with less btc then I started, I would probably be able to take more losses doing it the way you suggest. 
Bonus question, if you don't mind, you have been very helpful, if I were to report such losses would that increase my chances of being audited in any way shape or form?

Right, thanks.

I see, well what would be the worst case scenario for treating it as a like-kind exchange until the IRS states otherwise? Paying interest on the taxes I would owe from the alternative method? 
The thing is, I wouldn't mind reporting it in the first method you mentioned, but it would take me days or weeks to calculate such gains, it would be an extremely tedious process. But I will check out the link you provided, I am skeptical of it though because I could transfer my trades into it yet it would not know my initial cost basis for the btc I am trading, but I suppose there is a place to enter that in. That would date back to 2 years ago when I was first purchasing them. Thanks so much for your reply.
Edit: Also, I actually used the first method you described to report 2-3 small trades of small $ value last year, would that make my position of treating it as a like-kind exchange even worse?

Okay thanks again.

That makes sense to me, but would you say thats the safest way to report it for now? For instance, is their some tax rule you could point to, to defend the position that you are not really increasing your taxable income until you actually convert your bitcoin into $ or spend it? (with respect to say the example I gave of turning 1 bitcoin into 5)
