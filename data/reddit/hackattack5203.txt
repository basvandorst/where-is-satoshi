Bitcoin has inherit value, it cannot be distroyed, its the cheapest means to exchange value, fixed number of bitcoins, store of value, mining pool, its a scarce number of limited quantity that has function and security.
 is deflationary but that doesn't mean it will be destroyed by deflation, only increases in value. Even tho as output increases with a fixed amount of currency, prices decrease. That doesn't diminish the value of a bitcoin because it isn't only a currency. Its also a fixed number on the bitcoin network, which has more use and therefore value than simply a deflationary currency.

Firstly, Bitcoin can be divisible in millionths. Deflation would only occur from lost coin's. 
If bitcoin was commonly used, they would have an inherit value. The possibility of a valuable asset being lost in such large quantity's necessary to create a deflationary spiral causing bitcoin to have no 'liquidity' and thus no inherit value is just not that probable for human beings at present.   
It would be more likley that someone could acquire all the bitcoins through exchange or another currency makes bitcoin redundant.
An identical  deflationary spiral could take place for gold... But again... There's just too large of a quantity of gold for humans to misplace a large enough quantity to make it valueless. Same rule applies to bitcoin.

So I assume you also think the internet is valueless?
Please give one reason why fiat currency is a better store of value or means to exchange value than bitcoin (Controlled/governed by an authority (Feds/Govt) is not a reason). 
Your main problem is you cannot comprehend something digitial as being worth more than something tangible. This is simply old world vs new world. It reflects a lack of trust for digitized system's, bitcoin has inherit value, whether you choose to understand it or not.
You also believe that deflation is a negative thing. It's actually not nor does it cease economic growth. Deflation is only a problem when its associated with a fiat currency that has no inherit value, elusive as it sounds, you actually cannot make anything out of paper notes. Fiat currency is monopoly money believe it or not, agreed to be of value from a bank/govt, nothing else than a promise of trade, but no actual value.
Because bitcoin is a protocol of a finite amount involving communications. Its value increases as users join the network, it follows Metcalfe's law, thats why deflation isn't a negative thing, spiraling deflation would be impossible because a bitcoin cannot become valueless one day, it has inherit value through its scarcity and secuirty.
You cannot look at inflationary fiat currencies or tangible asset's, and take their behavior as applicable to bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't either, its both and more. Thats why Econ 101 does not apply to bitcoin, its a totally new concept.

I hope they implement two-way bitcoin transactions soon, being able to hedge into gold from bitcoin and back out would be a great asset.

Interesting article. I wasn't aware of the differences, thanks.

Yes bitcoin can succeed past this point. The majority of problems will be solved by entrepreneurs (or already have: you can transact in bitcoins with a mobile phone, and you could with just paper if you wanted). 
The real questions is at what point will 51% of people chose a decentralized currency over a centralized on, and that is really determined by "when will people realize that all centralized currencies are controlled by the rich to facilitate the rich"
Bitcoin now exists, it will never cease to exist, and in the long-run, it will prove to be a much better store of value than any fiat currency I guarantee it!

An interesting idea, but it really falls into a political economic problem. 
The ability to create digital currencies so freely changes a lot of possible economic systems. Countries, political parties, companies, groups or even individuals can create their own 'currencies'.
The real question is how will these game-changing ideas be realized. I have no idea.

Implicitly Factom does increase the amount of data that can be stored in the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-04-10 01:13:10
The data is held in Factoms decentralized servers, the whole point of Factom is to allow larger amounts of data to be correlated with the blockchain.
I know the block size cap in 1mb and that hasnt changed. Hence: 
Implicit = Suggested though not directly expressed.

I think everyone here is going to tell you that its a good idea. Not many people visit the bitcoin forum that aren't already invested in it. 
My only advice is to visit  to compare the exchanges and go with the best price / services you desire.
