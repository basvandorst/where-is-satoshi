Average transactions fees are around $20-25 USD right now.
You won't be able to easily spend that $43 without paying yet another $10-20 fee until fees come down which could take a month or longer.
For now it's "normal" but this wasn't how it used to be.  Many consider this "broken" others consider it "working as intended"
I can't say much more than that, this might be too much already.

It works with anything, you can do the same comparison for an online video game.
Lightning network has it's pros and cons 
Direct on blockchain has it's pros and cons
As space on the blockchain becomes scarce, it's not inconceivable a transaction could cost $2.00.  Peter Todd (not a blockstream employee) has even said he'd be totally happy with a world where he could wire money anywhere in the world transacting directly on the blockchain and cost $20.00 if it meant it was decentralized and anyone could use it.
Where do you draw the line on maybe deciding to use the lightning network over directly transacting on the blockchain when it comes to the fees involved.
There is a line, and when that line is crossed, it will change peoples behaviors as the cost outweighs all the other pros and cons.
The conflict of interest exists because they have some control on how/when that line is reached.

Blockstream intends to run a lightning network, and thus would collect fees on it.  Others can run their own as well, but they will run it too.  
If there is no scarcity on the blockchain and fees remain relatively low then there's no reason not to put your coffee on it.  The only reason you wouldn't is if fees were too high to make it worthwhile, but the 2nd tier layers like the lightning network would be cheaper and better use case for that, but only if fees get too high, which happens due to scarcity.

I was comparing that it's the same bandwidth requirements.
If miners are worried about the bandwidth, this does nothing (and neither does a block size increase)
I'm not against SW if the other things it can do are true, but it's not solving the actual problem.
@_date: 2015-12-19 06:49:24
You're missing the point luke-jr.  It's a conflict of interest.  They're going to code something, and they are going to run it, and collect fees.  End of story.
*Clarifying - And the higher the fees on the blockchain are, the more likely people will be to use it.
*Just wanted to add - It doesn't have to be coffee, it could be dinner where waiting 10 minutes for a confirmation is totally fine, or buying a game online.

There won't be any pressure from the ISPs during the fork because we aren't going to magically start getting 20mb blocks.  It's going to take time, so even if you're concerned about nodes dropping out, it's going to be well after the fork happens.
If you're talking about nodes rejecting the idea outright, that might be another discussion, but nodes dropping out due to pressure from their ISPs won't be a cause of a fork, just a reduction in nodes.

If it's dynamic, it's possible to abuse it by spamming transactions to artificially increase it over time.  It might cost a lot of money ,and will it actually happen who knows, but that is a reason to consider a hard cap, until a real solution is decided on, and fully tested.

Child pays for parent doesn't really solve the problem. Among it's other possible issues, in the scenario where the blocks are filling up, you might later realize that you paid to little and you need to pay more.  So you pay more.  But everyone else does the same thing.  People will pay as little as possible but enough that they think it will get them through in order to save money, but since everyone does it, everyone just ends up paying more fees and stay stuck.
Meanwhile, the mempool is still filling up since the blocks are to small and eventually and the cascading node crashes start.

Blockstream financially benefits from a world where space on the block chain is scarce so people will use their to be developed lightning network which has its own fees instead of simply using the bitcoin block chain. 
Are they truly holding an increase back because of this conflict of interest, only they know,  but the conflict of interest is real.

Storage isn't an issue, it already far surpasses anything we'd need for years even with BIP101 and the rate at which it's increasing, and costs coming down is dramatic.
Bandwidth will probably always be lagging on storage.

We'll all have access to this at a reasonable price eventually, well before it's needed, and then there will be the next big thing waiting to come down in cost.

With seg you'll get more transactions in a block and more signature data outside the block.   For a fully validating node,  there's no difference in data propagation than if there had been no seg in the first place. 
E. G. With seg. 
1000 transactions = 1mb + 1mb witness. 
With block size increase 
1000 transactions = 2mb
To fully validate a block which is what miners *should* be doing,  there's no difference, it's still 2mb
There is a difference when you don't need to fully validate.

This is a fact Luke-Jr.  
A conflict of interest doesn't in anyway say that they arein fact corrupted, only that the possibility for corruption exists.  The fact that the probability exists, creates doubt, and makes it difficult to trust what they say, regardless of their honesty.


In this case, Blockstream financially benefits from the lightning network being successful. If fees remain low on the blockchain, that reduces the reasons to use the lightning network.  Therefore, it's in Blockstreams financial interest, to have smaller blocks that create a scarce environment to encourage the user of their network due to higher fees on the blockchain.
To deny the conflict of interest just brings your own judgement into question. 
It would be more appropriate to say, yes it exists, but they are not behaving incorrectly.  That leaves it up to the people to decide.

For sure, it'll help speed up things in other areas, solve malleability, allow fraud proofs etc.   I don't see why we wouldn't go ahead and do it from what I've read.
It's just no solution.  At best it's a kick the bucket down the road for another 6 months or so with no future plan being decided on, and we'll just be back where we are now.
*Is there any time line on the other things like weak blocks etc.  Can they talk to their performance boosts yet or safety?  Where will capacity be in 2-3-4 years?
@_date: 2015-06-09 02:24:45
Sometimes consensus can't be reached.  If there's no pressure you can wait, like we have for 3 years now.  As the pressure builds,at some point, someone needs to make a decision.
We could debate if we've reached that time, but Gavin strongly believes we've reached it if we want to leave the proper time for all nodes to upgrade.
Given the scenario that Gavin thinks we're in, a decision needs to be made, and he'll make it with or without full consensus and let the network decide.  
"He's the lead developer on this.  Satoshi chose him, he's the right one to make the choice in this scenario.
This is exactly what should be happening in a situation like this.

If they gain/realize the savings from using bitcoin over credit cards, it might be in their best interest to start spending money advertising it so they can save more money on fees down the road.

You could charge a fee for that service.  This is the "safe" network, where nothing bad gets posted.

You're not trusting them with your coins.  
You're trusting them to immediately convert your coins into cash and deposit cash into your bank account.  You don't have to hold any coins with them.
They're like any other payment service provider out there.  At most your only ever risking 1 day of sales if the company suddenly went belly up and closed overnight.
As far as trust, it if you don't trust Coinbase or Bitpay to convert the coins for you, you've got bigger issues with Bitcoin companies as they're as reputable as it comes in the Bitcoin space.

We forked due to a bug in 0.7 - 0.8
When this happened someone performed a double spend attack as a proof of concept.  The finds were returned.
If this ever happens again at a larger scale, say some delayed bug which means most people have upgraded it could result in a network wide need for merchants to stop accepting bitcoins.
Would you want to accept bitcoins during an event that requires a fork with a double spend risk?
Companies like bitpay may step in and shut down their service with an alert saying we can't process due to fraud risks.

Just a thank you perk, many campaigns have them.  I picked a random kickstarter and it had this
Pledge $1 or more
Let us know you like the Moment Smartwatch and support our campaign. In return you get our sincere appreciation. Over the past 14 months we have created a product that we believe is exactly what people want. With your dollar you let us know we are on target with this design.
I know a group that did a successful campaign and they got over $1,000 from it, people just donated more than the minimum and didn't actually want to buy anything.   Just a show of support.
It also allows them to get backer only updates, so if someone wants to follow the progress they can.
By asking people to donate via any other method right now, you're hurting your own campaign because you can't show it on the progress meter.

Using a coffee shop was a bad example, as the pricing I was considering was card not present, which come at the higher rates and per transaction fee.  This would be more for small online purchases instead, likely digital in nature.
As per the link you provided
"An online business that processes $10,000 a month with an average ticket of $50 will pay about 2.80% of volume or $280 a month in credit card processing charges."
Change it to $2.50 instead of $50.00 and it becomes 12.15% fee per transaction.

I buy and hold because I'm beyond horrible when it comes to trading, and I believe enough that holding for a few years will leave me ahead of where we are now, and then.
I'd be losing coins if I was trading thinking I was catching the right times to get in or out repeatedly.  Even if my intention was just to get out and wait for it to bottom out... that wouldn't happen because I'd get all scared I was fucking up and trade again.  Plus the added stress.
I handle the dips well enough knowing that what I have is what I have, the drop to 400's didn't even phase me.

You can't ask anyone, its anon.  And refunding to the sent address is a bad idea as the sender might not own it.  
Never send a refund to the senders address, always ask for a new one, which you can't in this case.
E.G.  If I sent you a $100 donation from my coinbase account, it's very possible (i don't know) that coinbase sends you the funds from some random wallet of theirs, and simply adjusts some internal ledger saying I have $100 less.   If you refund it to the address, you might be sending the money back to coinbase, but not to me, and they would never know who it was for.

I sometimes wonder, if I ever did something like that (buy bitcoins for someone else when they were cheap) if I would actually let myself hand them over after such a big jump.  
Sure I could give some, but say I bought 500 back at $2.00... I don't think I'd give up 500.  Maybe not even 100... They wouldn't even know and would still love to get whatever I offered.
Of course if I'd bought 500 for them, I'd probably have thousands, so it's not like I wouldn't be well off anyway.

Bummer.  Well, it's just my opinion, but a Bitcoin ATM at an airport that doesn't get a large mount of international traffic, just seems like it could be a Bitcoin ATM at any other high traffic location.
The more international users the more it makes sense as they'll want to convert and use the ATM to save money.  For locals, it might be nice, but is the location really that convenient for the majority of the Abbotsford population or where people visiting Abbotsford may go?
Ideally they should be at all airports I agree, but in terms of traffic you'll get, it might not make sense.

A hot wallet is more convenient than a trezor, but less secure.  You shouldn't leave 100 bitcoins in a hot wallet, you're just asking for trouble if you do.
The moment you go to top up that hot wallet from your cold storage is when the security/convenience of the Trezor comes into play over cold storage.
You can't load a hot wallet from cold storage without exposing your private keys.  You also need to load the entire paper wallet onto your device, only spending part of a cold wallet is not advised due to change addresses and the risk of losing your coins.  (someone can correct me on the last part if I'm wrong, but this was my understanding)
If you really wanted to be secure with your cold storage when you go to spend it, you could load it into an offline device, and do offline transaction signing in an attempt to keep the keys protected, but that isn't as convenient as a Trezor.  You still risk that device being being compromised or connected to the internet by user error as well.
Trezor is not as convenient as a hot wallet, but much more secure. It's way more convenient to spend from than cold storage, and it's arguably as secure as encrypted cold storage, but I'll leave that last part to others with more knowledge to debate.

When you say trust an exchange, are you worried about a gox type situation or them stealing your USD after depositing it?
If you move the money in, buy right away, and then move the coins back to your own personal wallet, you can mitigate most of the risk.
Given what happened to gox, if you plan on leaving any USD/bitcoin on the exchange, staying up to date on what's happening is a good way lower your risk.  Gox had warning signs for quite awhile.

You're  low on the 2% with Visa and only 1% savings (assuming merchant passes them on)
Unless you're a very large company, many companies pay 2.5-2.75% +$0.10-0.30 per transaction.  
So if you're a store like a coffee shop that sells $2.50 items the merchant could in theory pass on much higher savings.
$2.50 @ 2.75% + $0.30 = $0.378
$2.50 @ 1% = $0.025
With Bitcoin that coffee could in theory be up to $0.35 / 14% cheaper.  Not to mention a dramatic rise in savings after more than 85 coffees having been paid for in Bitcoin and they stop paying the 1% and move to a $30.00 a month plan.
Edit: As per discussion below, this example probably doesn't work with a coffee shop.  I was considering card not present pricing which is higher for online businesses.

Hard forks aren't nearly as dangerous as Core is making people believe if we have consensus, even they admit they will do a hard fork with consensus.
*We have consensus on Segwit*, now they say that hard forks are too dangerous to do.
And yet it's not too hard to do to raise the block size, that's just about reaching consensus.
Core is afraid of doing a hard fork, and it's becoming more and more clear.  They're willing to reduce the security of the network (soft fork SW) to avoid them.  
The only thing we get out of the soft fork is we can potentially do it sooner, as a hard fork will need a longer lead time.  
The code in the soft fork is much hackier, which increases the chances of bugs and unintended consequences.  A hard fork would be simpler which is what you want in a project like this.

"nothing about the technology has changed" isn't really a true statement.
We have things like multi sig, and hardware wallets now.  It is progressing forward technology wise.  Problems are being fixed, and as of yet, there's been no technical flaw with the protocol that would suddenly cause a massive scare.
The next biggest thing will probably be the block size and how it's handled, and if we move past that, there will be something else.
As long as we can keep moving forward this way, and VC money continues to flow in, it still looks promising, even if adoption is slow.

If classic ends up happening, core is still going to be around and able to compete with it.    They can still make all sorts of changes,  and maybe people will switch back again at some point,  but if they don't raise the block size limit it would be unlikely. 
If classic screws up and causes a similar situation to what we're in now,  core would be an option,  or some other new client would pop up. 
Anything core programs post classic fork can still be used in classic as well,  if they write what people want,  it will be merged into classic, good code is good code.
The developers aren't being thrown out.   The decision making power that core currently holds is being decentralized. 
Anyone has the power to write code. They should be able to offer it,  and if the community wants it,  they should be allowed to run it.

Among other ways listed, I always thought that since they have access to multiple exchanges, they could pick whichever one offered the best rate at the moment, and still look better than other options.
E.G.  At the moment I wrote this
Bitfinex - 267.33
bitstamp - 268.50
btc-e - 267.51
Bitpay BBB - US Dollar 268.03
They sell your coins on bitstamp in this case.  Except they probably have even more exchanges that they are tied into, and I bet they don't even need to sell it in the currency you want if they think they could make money by selling into a different currency and paying you from their USD reserves?

Well for companies that are using Bitpay, you don't have any tax issues if you cash out, and lets be honest, most are.  If taxes from keeping the coins was really the issue for why you didn't want to keep accepting it, you could just turn that off and the issue vanishes.
There's not many internal control issues to be concerned about with Bitpay.  You need to ensure only the right people have access to make changes obviously, but in a smaller business that might even be just you and your partner. If they wanted to fuck you over by changing a setting, they could screw you over in many other ways.
What security issues are we talking about here?  It's a one way API key that generates a QR code for the customer to deposit to?  If someone is hacking in and changing that API key, they could probably do a lot worse.  If you're using a tablet at brick and mortar store, it's even less an issue.  (Also - many integrations like Shopify notify you of changes)
If you keep all deposits going into the same account as your credit card deposits, there would be a little more work there, but you get good reports to do this.  It's effort, but I wouldn't call it monumental.
I have no idea what you mean about mark to market problems, and I don't see how it impacts cash flows, if anything it improves them as you get the cash days earlier.

Many of the people (myself included) who want big blocks, think the soft fork version of SW is a bad idea.
If it's suddenly so important that we need to add a hacky fix to the problem and reduce the networks security, then maybe it actually is urgent, in which case they would have planned a small hard fork increase (before SW) months ago.
Lets do it right and wait.  Code it, test it, and put a 6 month lead time on it once deployed and prove we can do a hardfork.

I agree, the we can hotfix it quickly if needed, is a good argument, but for that to be true, things need to be properly tested.  Given what Gavin's done for the 20mb, it's likely okay at this point, but that wouldn't be the case for all emergency issues.
If not 20mb, I still think it needs to be increased to help push it a little further so we don't have to deal with the multi day problems of consistently filling the blocks at 1mb.  Aside from having to deal with all this crap in another year or two, would people really complain about 5mb?   That lets us test the hard fork mechanism as well.

It's also worth noting that the soft fork version of SW will not give us the full benefits right away.  We still need all the software to upgrade, and since they don't need to upgrade, and the upgrade is happening potentially too quickly for everyone to upgrade, they might not.  
It's possible it could be many months once deployed before we actually see the real benefits of SW, where as the hard fork it would be immediate.

I don't think this is what you were looking for, but I was curious.
Worst case scenario for wanting to switch, is if we somehow managed to mine 750 consecutive blocks supporting classic starting the day it was released. They would have approximately 5.2 days to move their hash power over before triggering the switch.
I looked at the pull request, and unless I read something wrong, it can't start until March 1st + 4 week grace period, but once the 750 blocks is hit, the activation is triggered, as in if it goes below 750 between then and March 1st, I still believe it will start the 4 week grace period and start allowing 2mb blocks?  (Can someone double confirm this for me please!) 
In reality, given it'll take time for people to switch the mining pools nodes over, you'll probably have over a month if things went really well for classic to switch away from it, or even longer if it's uptake is slower.

it's not as much now or later, it's hard fork or soft fork.
Many of us want SW, but don't like the impact of the soft fork version, which reduces the security model of all nodes that don't upgrade. *By security model, I mean nodes that don't upgrade can't verify SW transactions, they blindly trust them as legit.  
It also means it doesn't have immediate impact as a soft fork, where as a hard fork it would have full and immediate impact.

SW as a soft fork is much more complex than as a hard fork, and is very hacky.   More complexity means more bugs and potentially missed things. 
In order for it to work they're going to decrease security on all nodes that don't upgrade to SPV level.   
That's a bad precedent,  pushing a change through that lowers the networks security,  in a complex manner, with less support than is needed for a hard fork. 
More people would be on board with it as  hard fork,  but we may as well do 2mb blocks then and give proper time to study and test SW before deploying it. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:47:26
The number of full nodes is decreasing as users find out they don't really need to run a full node due to SPV clients.   Some are dropping off due to system requirements, but not nearly as many.
E.G.  All mobile phone wallets are SPV (as far as I know) so any new user who joins and only uses their phone, won't increase the node count.   
What we need is an increase of users who find value in being a node.  People need to see the value in being able to trust that their own transactions are validated properly.   The most likely candidate for this, is not the average user, it's business.
We need more users, to attract more business, and we need less volatility to have those business decide to use Bitcoin, and not simply cash out via a service like Bitpay.  Bitpay and Coinbase are business that use Bitcoin, and it's valuable to them to validate transactions themselves.
If every major accounting department for small, medium, and large business in the world starts using Bitcoin, it would be in their interest to be a node, so they can be sure that their business isn't being defrauded by a bad SPV client.
That's how we get more nodes with more users, which can happen via increased blocksize, and lower volatility from increased usage.

A few days ago with the other BU bug that took down nodes, they had pushed the fix to the public repo.  Someone saw the commit, figured out how to turn it into an attack, and took down the BU nodes, before the binaries were released.
Everyone on this sub was tearing them apart for publicly committing the fix before the binaries were ready, and critical nodes had been notified and upgraded.
So - There's another bug, which is highly similar to the previous one, and this time they fix it (and some other bugs) and don't publicly release the commit yet due to the outrage last time, while they wait for the critical nodes to upgrade.
And now everyone's tearing into them for doing this, which is what they were asking them to do before.
@_date: 2016-01-10 17:26:05
It's not a scalability enhancement.  With SW to validate a 1mb block still requires 2mb of data,  the same as  2mb block without SW.    The only reason we can do it now and it's being called a scalability fix is because we can do it as a soft fork which will reduce the security of all nodes which don't upgrade which is bad. 
That's not to say SW is bad.   Do it as a hard fork properly.   It solves malleability which is great,  and makes it more efficient for non validating SPV clients, but it doesn't reduce bandwidth needs for miners and fully validating nodes.
2mb is still 2mb 
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:01:33
~~That's not how it works, but in some cases that's how it's being presented.  Ill explain it below, but please bear in mind i may use an incorrect term, but the logic is correct.~~
That is true, but it doesn't actually make things "scale" better.  
With SW, the signatures are separated out into a validation "block".  
Lets say that a transaction is 10kb.  (random number) well up to 5kb of that data is actually the signature data (roughly)
With SW, we end up with 5kb of transaction data, and 5kb of validation data.
For a miner to validate the transaction, they still need to download the full 10kb.
With SW, they estimate that our 1mb of data once split, will hold twice the amount of transactions.  That means we'll have 1mb of transaction data, and 1mb of signature data.
The nodes still need to validate the full 2mb.  
Only SPV nodes (lowered security since they don't fully validate and assume the transactions are legit) don't need to download the whole 2mb.
*If this was done as a hard fork, it would be just as simple to raise the limit to 2mb.  (but then we lose out on the other SW benefits). 
Done as a soft fork, we do gain more transactions, at the cost of network security, as any node that doesn't upgrade, can no longer validate transactions, which is dangerous.

That's not a mistake.  If the developers decide to leave, that's their choice. I sincerely hope they don't, although I've heard some voice that they would.
The vast majority of their work is well appreciated, if losing control pushes them over the edge, then so be it.
They'll all be welcome to submit to classic, some of them might even be given commit access with time, but even if not, their work will continue to be valued and used if provided.

If a business outsources it,  then they don't see the value in it. If the government can mandate a business can't run their own full node,  we'd be in a very dire situation.  Also,  multiple governments would need to do this world Wide.

It is hacky, it's even using things that are reserved for miners to make it work as a soft-fork, and it does raise complexity.  It's a truth.  It'll increase the technical debt of our system implemented as a soft fork.
Nodes that don't upgrade won't be able to validate SW transactions, and if the majority of the transactions are SW, then your essentially an SPV client who has to trust the other nodes that the transactions are actually legit.
Sure, you might be able to validate some of them, but that's useless at that point.
If that's not SPV level security, please clarify on how not being able to validate transactions and trusting other nodes is different?
With a Hard fork it's explicit.  If you don't upgrade you won't function.  That's way better than if you don't upgrade you'll function at a lower than normal level.   Hard forks will also come with much more global communication than soft forks due to their nature.   If they don't upgrade, let them drop off.
Anyone that needs to care as in "Core Developers" because a lot of prominent developers and community members do NOT agree with a soft fork version of SW.
SW has only been on the test net for a few weeks now.  It may have been tested internally before, but now it needs to be heavily scrutinized by security experts.  It IS a complex change.  Trying to say it's a small patch (I saw someone say it's 500 lines of code, but I can't verify this) and not complex is just ignoring the truth.

The bitcoin client will download a new block each time it's found. When you turn the machine off, it just stops downloading more data.  When you turn it on, continues from where it was.
If you leave it off overnight for example, it might take 20 minutes to catch up (I don't have the exact number, but it takes time to validate)

You don't actually need to have your computer running 24/7 with port 8333 open to be a full node.
A full node is a node that's downloaded the entire blockchain and can validate it's own transactions.
You also don't need 100gb.  You can be a pruned full node, which will still allow you to fully validate all transactions, it just means you can't share pruned data it with others, but that's not a requirement for being a full node.
To be a full node, all you need to do is download a full node bitcoin client (E.G bitcoin core) and run it when you need it.  The longer you keep it closed though, the further it falls out of sync, so if you want to send or validate a received payment, it may take time to sync.
If you are inclined, you can open port 8333, but you don't need to.
*clarified you can't share pruned data, you can still share unpruned data.

It was added last week because belcher_ thought it appropriate to clarify when I started raising concerns.
If you look at theymos reply to me in this thread, he very clearly lays it out, and says it's been like this already.
Edit: the old page also didn't say the must store it all, it said they store it all by default.
"By default full nodes are inefficient in that they download each new transaction at least twice, and they store the entire block chain (&gt;60 GB) forever, even though only the unspent transaction outputs (&lt;2 GB) are required Performance can improved by enabling -blocksonly mode and enabling pruning."

False.  Opening your router ports has nothing to do with being a full node.
If you are validating all transactions, you are a full node.
@_date: 2016-12-20 03:53:44
You don't need to open your ports on the router to run a full node.  That's a secondary feature, not the primary feature.

Hey Luke,
Question for ya since I've seen this coming up multiple times now and it's something that's been bothering me lately.
I personally think that we've become too accustomed to having the term "full node" specifically mean that you've turned incoming connections on and that's the only or most important purpose.
As you've mentioned a couple times in this thread now, that the main importance is validating your own transactions and using it to receive payments.
Do you think there's a way to be more clear in how we communicate the difference (and that there is a difference) when discussing the importance of full nodes with people?
We clearly need to encourage people to turn on incoming connections as well, but I think we've lost sight of difference, which might be turning people off from running their own full node, but with incoming connections off.
@_date: 2016-12-20 03:50:50
Yes, you are.
*enabling incoming connections is an optional feature of full nodes, it is not being a full node.
@_date: 2016-12-20 05:36:53


That's not true.  You are a complete full node when you do this.  
I'm trying to have a discussion about this here, since there's a lot of misunderstandings going around.
@_date: 2016-12-20 04:52:53
I'm not too familiar with pruning, but could they not be a partial archival node, if they don't prune everything?
E.G.  Leave 1 month worth of blocks, so they distribute some data, while reducing their local storage needs?
@_date: 2016-12-20 03:49:00
You don't need to enable incoming connections to run a full node and experience all it's benefits.  You could still run it all month long.
@_date: 2016-12-20 05:11:32
Cool, just wanted some clarification.  I'm onboard with that.
@_date: 2016-12-14 05:07:57
The blockchain is currently 93gb of space, and will grow by no more than 144x(Max block size) per day. So 6 months from now, assuming 100% full 1mb blocks, it would be 26gb larger.  If SegWit activates, it would grow quicker depending on how big the new blocks are.
You can run a pruned full node though, which will shrink it significantly, and still allow you to fully validate all transactions.
You need an internet speed capable of downloading 1-2 megabytes every 10 minutes, which isn't very fast, but you first need to download the whole chain which could take awhile on a slow connection.
If you want to help distribute data to others, then you'll need some extra upload bandwidth, but you can share as much as you'd like, limiting based on your capabilities.
@_date: 2015-08-19 04:34:13

Upgrading to BitcoinXT is consensus by code.  It's the only thing that matters, and all *significant changes need to be validated this way.
In the long run it doesn't matter how many developers agree with the change if no one upgrades.
This really is the only way to show our consensus by code.  Upgrade if you agree, don't if you don't.  But censoring our ability to discuss it is ridiculous.

There are people that say bandwidth isn't going to increase, yet increases that go well beyond what we would ever need in the foreseeable future are happening. 
I do not accept your argument that everyone needs to be a node. There will be enough high speed bandwidth available worldwide as time goes on that it won't have any dramatic effect on decentralisation.

I'll admit there's some assumptions in there about continued growth, but what we can achieve today, in multiple countries (1gbps) is what we would need in 8 years for bip101.  
Just like all these other suggestions say let's reassess and hard fork again in 4 years time, we can always reassess in 8 years if bandwidth growth hasn't occurred as expected.  We'll have plenty of notice.
Its better to not have to hard fork if we don't need to as show by this whole mess.
Edit, because I like edits - I think it's a fair assumption that bandwidth will increase, even if its an assumption.
Also for what its worth, it's all the same assumption, not assumptions.  
Either bandwidth will increase and remain affordable in which case block size won't matter, or it won't and it will matter.

I just didn't do the 0's right that's all.  But if we've never had a block past a certain size, it should be pretty easy to fork and lower it.

I have a feeling this was done intentionally to force the issue.  Requiring 90% of miners could make it so one farm can hold bitcoin 'hostage' on a fork like this.
75% makes it more likely to happen, which will force the issue.  Change or get left behind.
75% is still a super majority but its not near unanimous consent, so some people might get dragged in.
It most definitely makes this more dangerous, but I believe (and I'd assume they do too) that if we hit 75% that the rest will come around as it'll be in their best mining interest to follow than be hold outs causing an even bigger problem.
Personally I hope as the % grows to 75% the two sides will come to some agreement in Core and XT will no longer be needed or used.
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:53:01

@_date: 2015-08-16 00:37:58
It only really requires a fork if the size has ever been reached no?
XT could say it's 80gb, but we've never gone over 20gb.  A patch could be put in that puts the limit to 30gb if 80% of the network upgrades thus removing the limit without any impact?
I guess that is a fork, but it's a much less dangerous fork than the way we're going now.

I don't know the legitimacy of it, but there was a greek post the other day saying even money is saftey deposit boxes weren't safe.
True or not, is leaving an unencrypted copy of your seed, really truly safe there? Free money to whoever breaks into it, or the government / bank stealing it from you during a bail in.
If you encrypt it, then you're back to having to remember the password and needing a mechanism for that.
It needs to be way simpler and not reliant on a bank to consider it safe.

SW uptake wouldn't be slow if we did it as a hard fork.  We'd release it in a cleaner way, and get the full benefit immediately, with none of it's soft fork downsides.
The incentive for SW shouldn't be the block size increase, it should be that it solves transaction malleability, and I believe from recent readings if true, also helps with the processing time of large input transactions which can become very slow.
@_date: 2016-02-03 06:22:36
With a hard fork, all the nodes would be upgraded at once so everyone would be able to accept SW transactions properly. The hard fork version is easier for other developers to implement as well, so it would happen faster.  You're right though, I was wrong, we would still need all the other software to update, we wouldn't see 100% SW transactions immediately after the fork.
As others have mentioned in the thread, the effective increase will for awhile be negligible and will take time to come into play. 
I completely disagree with the ability of the devs (any devs) to make such a dramatic change to the rules as with a soft fork when it causes nodes that don't upgrade to no longer be able to validate the transactions.  I know they've done it before, and it was a slippery slope, and this is further down the slope.  This is the kind of change that the network needs to agree too through a hard fork process, not have their security reduced if they don't agree.  If they were able to solve that issue with the soft fork, I'd maybe be for it, but they can't.
The only reason there's a perception of the network being under attack is Core refusing to raise the limit.  They could have easily planned a hard fork ages ago, but they still refuse, and are now using SW as the excuse to not do it.
*And we should have regularly planned hard forks to do away with these "soft forks" that break compatibility with un-upgraded clients.  Then we wouldn't need them.
@_date: 2016-02-04 00:31:38


And it's bad


I wasn't actually advocating that, but you seemed to imply (maybe I was mistaken) that people wouldn't be able to do non-sw transactions earlier, so I added that as a "in that case" scenario.  I agree, it would be bad.
I and others simply disagree on the veto. We'll never agree on that, it's our interpretations of the white paper and Satoshi's social contract.  I think we should be able to fork around Core if the need arises, you think Core has the final say and must be followed in all circumstances.


Maybe if you altered their client, but not by default.  The soft fork makes the payments come in and show as being valid.  I'm not even sure how that would work once a coin was used in a SW transaction previously, as the history would be broken and unverifiable.  It might mean you could never validate a transaction that was touched by SW.
@_date: 2012-11-11 22:39:18
Possibly, but if you wrote a mining program to hunt these down, would you really open it to the public or keep it to yourself.   It could also be considered theft even if no one would know since it was abandoned? 
@_date: 2016-02-03 06:40:34


It's better to kick them off (hard fork) than let them think they're still working perfectly fine.  


It wasn't an attack, Core/Theymos made it out to be an attack.  Forking the network around censorship or the client not meeting peoples needs is exactly how it's supposed to work.  Theymos is probably the biggest cause of the perception of attack due to all his censoring and shit storm he caused.
If they would just let it play out, they'd either be right and it would die, or they would find out they were wrong and that consensus was reached.
You can't reach consensus if you can't talk about reaching consensus or give people the opportunity to choose it.
*And there clearly isn't consensus on a SW soft fork, but they're doing it anyway because they can try and force it as a soft fork rather than letting the network decide properly with a HF

I thought I read somewhere that people could go hunting for abandoned addresses that never get encryption upgrades as cracking power increases.   Eventually reclaiming lost bitcoins 
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:04:28


The risk is that they're preventing non-upgraded nodes from validating transactions, but validating transactions is the core of Bitcoin.  I'm not saying everyone needs to perform SW transactions, but that everybody needs to be able to validate ALL transactions.   To say that everything is okay if no one does a SW transaction is silly, because of it is released, people will do SW transactions.  With a hard fork, people could still do non-sw transactions, and people would be able to verify them.  And *if* all transactions were forced into SW via the fork, then we'd have 100% use right away anyway.  If you didn't upgrade with the HF, you get kicked off the network, which is better than being duped.


I and others simply disagree.  Giving core such veto power, is essentially saying they have final say on everything = dictatorship.  At that point you need to believe that they are a benevolent dictator which I do not think is the case given what's been going on.  We must have the ability to fork around this perceived threat (real or not) regardless of what the debate is about (doesn't need to be the block size) or Bitcoin will be a failed experiment.  They were never meant to have that much power.  It needs to be maintained through trust, which they are losing.


Producing a client that increases the size if the network adopts it via hardfork is not forcing.  It's how it's supposed to work.  Putting out a soft fork like SW is imposing their preference at the risk of node security.
Hard fork = choice (stay on the small chain if you're that serious about it, and there's enough people that are)
Soft fork = imposed rule
*I added some extra text.
@_date: 2016-02-03 06:54:37


That's a silly argument to make.  


It's as much about forking around censorship or dictators as it is that.  We did not vote Core in, and we are not beholden to them.  They need to maintain everyone's trust to be able to continue.


We've had consensus for 2mb for quite awhile.  The only reason it wasn't done before was because big blockers wanted bigger blocks (which I still want myself) but we've been willing to come down to the 2mb that everyone else found acceptable, including even Adam Back.  Now Core won't do it, which is causing the 2nd shit storm.

Yep, thanks for clearing that up! I think it was just the wording that messed me up, I'm well aware of the issue looming in the future somewhere.
If volume goes up high enough that small fees are enough, great.  If that doesn't happen, then we'll need a fee market.  If the fee market is to costly to maintain for users and miners start leaving, then this scenario might happen.

I don't understand how that would be the choice.  How does inflation prevent all of those issues you described in the other option?
However the inflation version fixes it, all those patches could be applied to the other client, minus inflation.
Unless you're telling me inflation alone would prevent all those problems in some unspecified way.

XT doesn't have some deadline for a hardfork if 75% isn't met.
@_date: 2015-09-02 03:48:31
Maybe this is something we should put high on the priority list then?
Edit: But we do seem to use it anyway for other forks, so it's gotta work at some level.
@_date: 2015-09-02 04:21:33
I meant support from the whole community via polls.  Dev, Merchants, Users, Miners.  The harder the fork, the less likely it'll be to ever get that kind of consensus though, and it's still only a poll at that point in time.
@_date: 2011-07-23 16:57:11
Just a guess, but yes.
@_date: 2015-09-02 03:29:19
Maybe I misunderstood what happened then, but I understood (and given the other replies I've seen) that Gavin used his lead position to push it through when there was still uncertainty as he thought it was the correct thing to do at the time
Maybe the consensus part was wrong, but if Gavin wasn't lead at the time to push it through, the debate could have gone on quite awhile longer, and in this case, likely have come up with a better solution, but that's hindsight.
Is that a better representation of what happened?
The main point being though - That I do believe we need someone that can make a decision when decisions can't be made.
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:53:58
Its not about right or wrong (and in this case in hindsight maybe he was wrong) but that it happened.
In that case I doubt it would have stalled indefinitely, but in this case its been stalled for years, and no one is making a decision, and were running out of time. (Debated)
@_date: 2015-04-22 01:54:55
Multi Sig isn't a backdoor because it doesn't compromise the entire security of the platform if someone steals a key, only the wallet.
With a backdoor to the entire encryption, all it takes is some combination of bribery, blackmail, extortion, social engineering, viruses, malware, kidnappings or stupidity to put the entire user base at risk.
@_date: 2015-09-02 02:31:25
Starting at 1mb is to small and will take too long to scale up if/when needed, and 8mb is still to small for wide adoption.  
In perfect miner agreement 8mb could be reached in a couple years but all future growth would halt, simply forcing the debate again. In a not so perfect world they'll keep it as small as possible, balancing increased fees vs more transactions at lower fees, putting the network in constant danger of spiking volume without the ability to raise it fast enough.
We need a way to have a guaranteed overhead for spikes.
I do like how you used median vs what is going on with BIP100 which I think is a disaster waiting to happen.
Honestly though I'm generally opposed to letting the miners vote dynamically as I don't think we should bestow new powers on them.  It also means we don't have any predictability on what the network can handle at any time in the future which causes  uncertainty, and *could stop innovation on the block chain.

What if they hadn't ever come to consensus and still today we were debating it?
P2sh was an important to add  security feature that we needed to help with an immediate problem bitcoin was facing with regards to security.

Honestly I'm not sure how heated the debate was at the time, just that he made the decision.
Perhaps if someone had made the decision on size much sooner, things wouldn't have divided so bad.  This has been going on years.  Simply deciding (for good or bad) years ago might have been the better choice.
@_date: 2015-09-02 03:14:11
True. It'd be interesting to compare how many kept it at default 7xx since the last time this happened and people called them out for not having it set to 1mb.

@_date: 2015-09-02 03:46:02
That doesn't make any difference at all. As long as the fork is set in the future with a high percentage of the network accepting it before it turns itself on, that's perfectly fine.
Without the options to do this, Bitcoin will fail.  This is probably the easiest "hard" hardfork we'll ever have, and it won't be the last time this happens, and THAT'S OKAY.

The reason p2sh got implemented is because Gavin, among lack of consensus, made a decision and chose the direction that led to its implementation
@_date: 2015-09-02 05:28:56
Back to my point about Gavin though, as others have said (even in this thread) that he threw his weight around (Lead Developer) to force some decision making in some way or another?  Did he not?
I'll admit I had some facts wrong, but I was trying to point out that having a benevolent dictator can get things done.  I'm in no way trying to say that one will always make the right choices, just that it keeps things moving.

I know this can't be regulated and it would depend on the mining pool operator, but wouldn't it be in everyone's best interest to stop accepting new miners to your pool once you reach 40-45% or so of the network capacity?
It might not be an issue as the network gets bigger, but if it's happened once it could happen again.

@_date: 2015-04-22 02:16:52
You're absolutely correct, nations already do that.  The best defense against that is using open source encryption, but even that has errors in it, but it's harder to intentionally compromise.  In theory anyway.
And it's a backdoor because it IS a backdoor.  It could take a thousand keys, but it's still a backdoor.  Once exploited, it's exploited.

It might be wise to always have an empty/low value wallet when you see the client as well. Keeping everything on your phone over time isn't a good idea.  Move it elsewhere that you can't access easily on the job if you decide to keep it rather than cash out.

Well, it's the only option we have to give an alternative in the meantime, and this won't be the last time it happens this way.  Hopefully we find a better way to do it before the next time something like this comes up.
If/When it ever happens though, I don't believe the two forks would co-exist for any serious length of time.  One would eventually win and the other be given up on.

I'm thinking it would be a QR code / scanner like dopplerbike mentioned. You generate the QR's with coins that MtGox has already verified.
They would become an intermediary so you wouldn't need to worry about the 10 minute confirmation as they would be considered legitimate.
They could then charge a small fee (smaller than credit card companies) to provide the service to stores.

Do you disagree that by sometime in 2016 we'll be maxing out 1mb blocks just from increased usage, or if another bubble happens?
If we don't have something in place before one or the other it'll cause problems which could turn a significant amount of people away.
It takes time to implement the solution, and 2016 is nearing.  The whole uncertainty around the matter could also be holding bitcoin back as larger players don't see it scaling yet.
Edit: without this push, it would have dragged on much longer, the issue is being pressed now which is good, but it doesn't mean we'll get a solution in time
@_date: 2015-09-03 02:17:46
That's an existing mechanism.
A hard fork only has 2 main ways to activate.
Activate when x% of the network is using it, or some future time

That happened to me awhile ago, exact same fork.  Didn't think it had been so long
@_date: 2015-11-07 07:28:20
When the blocks fill up, transactions take longer to process.  When we have too many users and let's say reach 6 transactions per second, we would be making an ever growing backlog of transactions at twice our current processing rate. It could take hours or days for it to process unless you pay a higher fee.  The more user's the higher the fees  get as you compete for space, but it doesn't stop the backlog from growing.
This already happens from time to time as we already reach capacity at times, and transactions unexpectedly take 1-3 hours to process.
It creates a bad user experience and people will simply leave.
*E.G.  You go to buy a video game from an online gaming site with bitcoin, but you get the fee wrong or get outbid. Instead of waiting 10min to play the game, now you need to wait 3h, but you don't even know how long it would actually take.  If that happened to me, I'd just use my credit card next time.
*If you want to see the current transaction counts in megabytes you can check this site out   On the far right, in the middle, it shows the total size of transactions waiting to be confirmed.  As of my edit, there's 3.89 mb waiting, so up to a 40 minute wait depending on the fee you gave, and 10 min block discovery times.

As new tech comes out, we could always update the rule as we realize that we can handle more than we originally planned in the fork, by having another hard fork.
No one knows how hard it will be to transmit 8Gb in 21 years, but given that 1gigabit connections are becoming more and more common today already, it's not hard to imaging that we could transfer 100Gb/s by 2036.   *Meant to write Gb/s not gb/s which we can already do.
The key thing is - hard forks are difficult, and we don't want to do them often.  BIP101 gets us through now without needing a change tomorrow.  It's not saying we'll never do another change.
@_date: 2015-03-31 20:05:57

Great question! We handle the credit card number like a Bitcoin address. For SpendBT we store the number in plain text for 30 days, then truncate all records older than 30 days to the last four digits. You cannot, under any merchant system we've ever seen, place a credit card charge with solely the number. You always need at least the expiry to match. Just like you cannot make a Bitcoin transaction with just the public key. When you actually are generated a QR code, the site warns "Use each QR code only once". We may in the future allow a permanent address we monitor and top up in perpetuity, thanks for the feedback! SpendBT Team

The banks are NOT storing credit card numbers in plain text, they're required to store cards encrypted just like everyone else.
When a bank displays the number back to you when you make a payment, they're decrypting it on the spot.
*I think I missed part of the point you were making, but when they claim they're truncating the PAN after 30 days, it means they're in full control of it.
A system like you're talking about where the info is stored on a PCI compliant encrypted 3rd party server would work, but they would still need adequate security practices to ensure that the unencrypted cards they can see when they log in are safe.
A good system wouldn't even let them see the cards again or at the very least without some secondary control as they could do everything via tokenization.

Absolutely. They'll give anyone a refund if they ask, and in the meantime they've had a free loan. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:58:22
Even quicker if you use their new debit card.
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:39:16
I'm curious, what kind of things need to wait until then?
Or do you just mean people finally willing to invest even more at even higher scales?
@_date: 2013-11-17 08:23:42
I wouldn't recommend using that debit card for day to day spending. The fees are too high at $1.50 a purchase, $3-4 ATM withdrawal (theirs+banks) and $2.00 monthly fee (if it has a balance)
It's an great way to convert BTC -&gt; CAD for larger amounts and full balance withdrawals, but to use it for daily purchases or to keep a balance on it just means you're going to pay a ton of fees.
Edit: I just want to add, for those who for whatever reason can't get a normal bank account, or don't want one, this card is pretty cool for not needing one.

Guess you'll just need to wait until a company comes along with a lower minimum.  
They already have pretty large coverage at $20 minimums, just give it time.

Well I won't take that bet, but I'll check that out after work :-)

That balances out the 0.3 bitcoin I lost a few days ago.  I was actually up 0.6 and went in for another trade but then it just kept going up, and up and up, and up.  
I caved and bought back in ending up -0.3 overall glad I didn't keep waiting. 
I have a feeling it aint going back that low for awhile.
Edit: I should totally track that as a loss for whenever I do end up paying taxes heh.

If you keep some and don't cash it all, you can give even more to charity if it does well. 
Think of all the extra good you can do by holding onto some and see where things go?

They're actually working on a way for a recurring billing method, and it should be out in the next client release.  A company can request you send another payment, and you can accept it.

What do you call a fish with no eyes?  Fsh.
I swear its funnier I'd you say it out loud

They are refunding.  It's really only a loss of potential other investment IF they don't ship or you ask for refund after some time.

From what I've understood, it's only once you go past the 100 addresses it pre-generates, or if you've just encrypted your wallet and generated 100 new ones.
If something goes wrong after the 101st transaction, and you have to go to your backup, the 101st address won't be in the backup.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:04:04
Why wouldn't they accept BTC?  It's cheaper to accept than credit cards, and they don't need to worry about chargebacks.
It's a win win situation for them if they cash out immediately.

What about making something and selling it online for BTC?  
The great thing about BTC is you can easily start accepting payments right away.
I read about this one kid who was making origami bookmarks and selling them for a couple dollars a pop.
Can you make anything someone would buy?
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:55:40
I love to see them, it helps let me know that it's working for others out there in the real world.
Now, if the OP kept posting messages frequently about his site, and it accepting bitcoin I'd feel differently, but in situations like this, it's great.
@_date: 2013-12-25 21:52:58
Very good points. I actually meant as a way for you to recover unmoved coins, so yes an expiry date that's clearly communicated is very important.
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:54:25
cavirtex just recently had their IPO and it's on havlock investments. I'm not sure how much longer they'll be able to keep their fees where they are though which is a big part of their current income.
They're working towards merchant API's and stuff, so could be a bitpay for Canada type thing in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:44:35
That overhead being paid for in the card fees.  That's one of the reasons they won't lower them.

I see bad stuff posted here frequently.  Someone lost their coins, an exchange gets hacked, an exchange isn't completing a transaction properly, the feds are talking about it being too risky due to terrorism etc.  The whole butterfly labs ordeal.

You could also post on Craigslist, or any online classified and just say you're looking for payment in Bitcoin.

Care to explain why it's sketchy a bit more?  I have shares through Havlock, and I've never had any issues with them before, and always had prompt replies to queries.
The 5% fee kinda sucks, but I am interested in what you think is risky about it?

For a website that deals with money, you really need to have better password requirements.  Right now you would fail PCI compliance.  I know you don't need to meet it's standards since you don't hold credit card data, but it's a good standard to try and follow.
At least 1 of each:
Upper/Lower case
Alpha and Numeric
Special Character
Minimum 8 length (preferably 10) 
I was able to make very simple passwords like aaaaaaaa

Can you deposit cash anon to a place like cavirtex?  If it's not logged that it's YOU, then you could maybe get away with it?  Or buy the coins in person?
Just don't do a bank transfer.  That can be tracked and they might figure it out.
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:24:10
BitPay now has monthly plans from $30 topping out at $3000 a month.
If Bitcoin takes off, that's significantly less than 1% to convert to cash for a big company like this.

What would trigger such a dramatic drop though? I don't doubt that it can happen, but I definitely think it won't happen without some mitigating factor? 
Could it really be as simple as, oh this isn't as special as we thought, boom. 
Edit:just to add, it's making it through the ddos on Mt gox and it made it past that recent site hack.

They're using government incentives right now yes.  The government awards these to help push advancements in areas where there isn't enough funding.
They won't last forever, and anyone who can meet the requirements to receive them can get them, they aren't special, aside from the fact that they are making an eligible product
Elon was saying in the Q1 call that they are still on track to have a 25% gross margin in Q4 WITHOUT ZEV tax credits.
It helped them post their first profit in Q1, but they won't be reliant on them soon enough.

If Bitcoin actually does take off and nothing stops it, that will easily become worth hundreds of dollars over the next few years, and maybe even thousands far down the line.
At a ~30.00 investment, not much downside, but a high potential upside.
Edit: And it lets you feel more involved if you have some!

Article is wrong. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 03:10:18
As far as I know they've always given refunds, but it might take awhile to get the money (couple weeks)
The real issue though that they can be earning interest this entire time on the millions of dollars they've received.  They can keep delaying, they already have the money.  If they ever decide to fold and refund everyone, they still earned tens of thousands in interest.
Now it actually does appear like they are trying to ship these things, so they're just incompentant fools who scammed everyone into paying them well before they were ready.
Disclaimer - I am an early purchaser of a 60gh single. *and I don't intend to get a refund at this point.

On his note, if you have something you don't want, selling it on bitmarket would be a great way to get bitcoins. You're parents wouldn't even know.
You could use your allowance to buy a video game, play it, and then put it up for sale for Bitcoin.
No need to deal with the exchanges then.

Every time you use a credit card you put your card info at risk of fraud. Either a compromised terminal, or a really shitty employee who's skimming the card data somehow.
Granted, you're covered in nearly all cases when this happens by the credit card company, but it still sucks.
And do you really need to do a chargeback on a meal?
Physical goods then sure, you're giving up that chargeback protection.
