Thanks for trying! It's all quite confusing! To be honest I don't have a clue what I'm doing. I've got now 5 channels ("contacts"), of which 2 are to the same address, 3 are online and 2 are "pending". None of them allow me to pay at yalls.org or starblocks, so far :-(
To connect to starblocks I tried connecting to 
03933884aaf1d6b108397e5efe5c86bcf2d8ca8d2f700eda99db9214fc2712b134 (they should mention this on their website) but so far I don't know if I succeeded. Either way, pretty cool!!

So who pays the channel closing fee? The part that closes the channel, I'm guessing?
If you open a channel with another party, but without sending them money, can they close the channel and make you lose some satoshis?

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:59:57
yes, that's definitely the reason. Holding your money on the bank: you see it decrease in value (due to inflation). Hodling it in BTC: you see it increase.
It's the hodlers that give BTC value. If everybody would buy BTC and ditch it the next week: it wouldn't gain in value.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:35:21
EDIT: thinking further on this, this might be an effective marketing technique, even. A well-known sales (&amp; scam) technique is to offer someone a "gift", and once they accept the gift, they feel obliged to return the favour, for example by buying the stuff your selling. 
So if you've received some cents to watch a Campbell's Soup ad, you might unconsciously just feel a bit more inclined to buy a Campbell's Soup in the supermarket next time your shopping.

I think it never gets "bounced" but you can always replace it with a transaction with higher fee. If it's replaced and therefore no longer correct, it'll get bounced or forgotten I guess. Don't really know how this works. It's your trezor/wallet/... which is broadcasting the transaction, and it gets relayed by the nodes.
@_date: 2018-09-22 08:16:24

Follow the advice given here. Before sending funds to your ledger: see if you are comfortable with wiping it completely and restoring it. I didn't do this at first and had to send funds back and forth between my electrum on my laptop and my ledger. Silly way to lose (fee) money.

@_date: 2018-05-29 22:23:01
Difficulty adjustments are every 2016 blocks. If a block is mined each 10 minutes, this means about every 2 weeks.
I don't know if the blocktime is linear with the hashrate, but if so, and if we'd only have 10% of hashrate, I guess we'd have a blocktime of 100 minutes, which would mean for 2016 blocks it would take 140 days. So it would take a long time, but it would probably not kill bitcoin, only cripple it for an agonizing 5 months. Transactions would still be broadcasted, only you wouldn't get confirmations. And the mempool will explode :-)
If we would drop to 1% of hashrate, we'd have a blocktime of 1000 minutes, meaning for 2016 blocks would take 1400 days, or 4 years.
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:28:40
Where can we read up on this?
@_date: 2018-05-29 22:02:21
The question will be if bitcoin will be so much better than governments. Taking away (monetary) power from the government doesn't mean things will get better per sé.
However, now that bitcoin exists, we can't go back. It's unstoppable.

Of course, in such a scenario, what would be the value of those green bits of paper with $ or € printed on them......
When I was young, I was an optimist. Nowadays I'm getting much more grim. I've got a son of 3,5 years old, I often wonder what the world will look like for him in 30 years, when he's my age. I feel like the world is a coin spinning on its edge, waiting to trip to either side.
Heads, we are in a technological walhalla, solar powered world, electrical cars, bitcoin world currency, humans on mars, etcetera...
Tails, we are on an overheating planet, with hatred and lies spreading through our societies and politicians, and the world as we knew it from our youth shattering before our eyes...
I'm hoping for heads. But maybe I should learn how to use a rifle. Just in case it's tails.
@_date: 2018-05-29 22:30:51
A moral currency - I don't know if that's possible. The nature of bitcoin seems to me rather to be immoral, meaning, without any judgement of good or bad at all. Like a machine.
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:23:35
that's true!! awesome
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:22:50
You bet. I often wonder what would happen if bitcoin would lose, say, 90% of its hashrate overnight. Perhaps indeed due to a nuclear war &amp; apocalypse. With the very high difficulty, new blocks would be almost impossible to mine. And a difficulty adjustment would take forever. Perhaps the only option would be to make a hard-fork and continue with the remaining 10% of hashrate.
Or what would happen if, with a nuclear apocalypse, the internet would be split into two? As far as I understand China is behind "the great firewall" - I suppose they could cut all the cords completely.  (I'm imagining a global nuclear war).

@_date: 2017-08-18 20:36:04
Sure thing, let me explain from my side: I'm new to this game, I'm one of those "late adopters" you need for bitcoin to become mainstream. So I'm ready to pump some of my hard earned euro's into bitcoin, only now I hear there's an alternative, and blah blah... Result: I'm getting doubtful of investing in bitcoin, maybe I should choose bitcoin cash, I've got to put my money into two coins, etcetera. The "hashing power" that secures the network is getting divided instead of growing. It's less valuable.
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:24:36
So what's the hashrate of BCH?
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:08:49
So will this be the other way around again, sometime? BTC more profitable to mine than BCC?
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:34:14
Hmmmm... first I'd like to see my investment back on the original level and higher, so that means BTC needs to rise a bit. Then I'm gonna buy a small amount of some altcoins to diversify my coins. Then I'm going to move it all in a hardware wallet, and put it in a sock under my bed, and forget about it for 5 years.
I'm hoping BTC starts rising after lightning network kicks in, but I'm not betting all my money on that. 
I'm betting that cryptocurrencies will continue to rise, and I think also that there will be one winner only (like Google VS altavista,yahoo,... and facebook VS myspace, netlog, ...) Whether it's Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash, Ripple, Dash, Dogecoin or whatever... we'll see. But holding a small amount of each doesn't hurt (a lot).
It's all interesting stuff to geek around with, however. I might try setting up a node - seems fun.

@_date: 2017-08-18 17:18:51
Nice! With the forking events and all, or seems to me that users should also be miners, to allow the "small" users to have influence in the direction Bitcoin is heading. If you can buy a miner and have it hosted at a factory far away, without any hassle, seems convenient and smart.

I also think so.
Plus the amount of people on this subreddit is gradually increasing. A year ago there were usually about 8000 people online when I check, now it's about 11.000. The amount of people in crypto is increasing, so the scarcity is increasing, so the value is increasing...
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:57:54
Agreed, it's not inflation, but as aantonop says in this video at 1:10
 
"it does mean you have twice as many coins, but they're now worth half as much or less" - and there's some level of truth to that.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:16:43
But if you want to buy extra coins right now, you have to make a choice. This fork stuff has damaged the value of bitcoin. It feels a bit like inflation, to me.

@_date: 2018-06-23 06:17:23
The other question is: **who is buying ?**
It takes a lot of faith/balls/...?... to buy after seeing BTC drop from $20.000 to $6000.
More supply than demand -&gt; price goes down.
We can only hope that suddenly there's **no more supply** and a short squeeze, followed by massive fomo buying.

@_date: 2017-11-30 00:42:35
Good advice, I like that.
I didn't want to give some selective statistics, my point merely was: altcoins are rising, but bitcoin is rising faster.
And a pattern that seems to return in most altcoins (when looking at them in BTC): a flat-line, then a pump, and then a steady decline. So if you can get in on the flat-line, and get out after the pump: well done! But I know I can't put the time &amp; energy in that.

Indeed, I don't think he will. But this whole pump of BCH we are seeing, and all the "mysterious" miner who's hoarding all his BCH, that costs money. Real money, to pay real electricity bills. And Bitcoin money, to influence prices. And perhaps to make spam.

Yep, when watching price graphs on CoinMarketCap I look at the orange line, which is the price of the coin in BTC. After the peak, there's almost always a steady decline. Most of the time you would have been better off holding BTC than the altcoin.

Even if "simple" users wouldn't control their own keys, other interesting properties of bitcoin remain: (almost) no inflation, not controlled by any government, internet money.
However a lot of economists say inflation is necessary - so living in a deflationary economy will be interesting... "The Zero Marginal Cost Society" by Rifkin is an interesting read in that point of view.

Agree... don't know why this would be bullish. But I don't think there'll be any regulations 6 feb... and either way, there's not much they can regulate on bitcoin itself, only exchanges can be controlled I guess.

I had these spinning fans as well. I tested Zap and it's cool, but it's still very much in a test-phase, I wouldn't trust my money on it... yet.

to get bitcoin rising again, all I have to do is sell (preferably at a loss)... 
because the exact moment I sell, I'm sure to see the value rising again (preferably exponentially)...
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:57:31
Maybe an indication to change the ETH and LTC into BTC? They will never rise as rapidly

Well, you're right about the 5000, but the ban is still there I think.

would be interesting to have the same for testnet - for people who are testing software.
 E.g.  I was trying out Zap a while ago and couldn't find the node of starblocks.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:27:51
do you think someone with a lot of BTC might drive down the price of BTC by doing a massive sell-off? (And drive up the price of S2X by doing a massive buy-in?)

Maybe this?

I think you should all read "**The Zero-Marginal-Cost Society**" by Jeremy Rifkin. The author states that capitalism is going to cease to exist. Not due to communism or anarchism or whatever, but capitalism will make itself cease to be. 
As the market and production methods get more &amp; more efficient, it's harder and harder for companies to make a profit. This due to internet, robots, AI, internet-of-things, massive-online-open-courses, ...
With this is mind, Bitcoin's rise is very interesting.

I'm guessing you could set up a channel with someone, send him 0.4 BTC, and have him send back 0.4 BTC in another channel back to you?

this is great advice, but one doesn't understand that, until you've bought and seen the price drop, so you know "I could've bought cheaper/more..."
Humans learn best by experience.

Happy to see they also include the Belgian franc, which stopped circulating in January 2002.
1 BTC is 207589 BEF.

Ok, I checked it:
January price of ETH: 0.008 BTC
June peak price of ETH: 0.153 BTC
Current price of ETH: 0.066 BTC
So YTD you're certainly at a gain, but since the peak in June it's going down, compared with BTC.

I think Bitcoin could become a universal currency. But to become a universal payment system, the second layer is necessary, imho. So Lightning Network, or something alike.

I'm not a trader, but isn't this possible with "shorting"? 
E.g. Bitcoin is at $4000,
trader takes a short position for 1 BTC because he/she expects marker to drop,
but alas! bitcoin goes to $5000, 
trader has now a negative balance of - $ 1000.

Imagine USA bans bitcoin, and Russia starts loading up on it. It would be as if BTC is a limited natural resource of which Russia has plenty and USA none. This would be a situation which USA would want to avoid. So I don't think it's in any country's interest to ban crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:32:42

And Bitcoin will remain around forever, as long as the internet's around. So you can be sure bull runs to 20.000$ and more will happen again. It's only the question...when? Might be next month, or 80 years from now...

I guess now Bitcoin is gaining some value, because people are trying to get more bitcoins, since August 1st their coins will be "doubled". Then after August 1st, people are going to want to get rid of their BCC and get real cash out of it, which will give a spectacular downfall of the value of BCC.
Also after august 1st the value of Bitcoin BTC will decrease a bit, because of the inflation effect (doubling the number of coins), because of the insecurity, and because now it's peaking a in anticipation of the fork.
So if BTC drops some time after august 1st, that would be a good time to buy. Am I reasoning correct?
