I guarantee you that the $100 bill is about 50x more secure than the largest Mickey Mouse euro denomination in terms of anti-counterfeit measures.

If that were true, why not make a competing currency.
Oh right - it's not about technology. It's about pure greed.
Let's face it - bitcoin is too new for anyone to have an educated idea on what it will do. Warren Buffet couldn't tell you what it will do.
Sure, everyone will spout "Gospel" from "Mount Sinai" about fundamental analysis and Foucaultian theory and blah blah blah blah blah circlejerk blah blah economics bullshit with no bearing on reality blah blah.
Bitcoin is pure speculation. If you invest a significant portion of your savings in Bitcoin, you're putting a significant portion of your savings on the roulette wheel.
And that's okay. Unlike roulette, there is no house edge. Just a vast 'who fucking knows' and super high variance. Nothing more really needs to be said.

I can do the same thing and put it on the roulette wheel. And then when I win, can backwards rationalize that I'm some sort of mystic, all-seeing savant and investment guru. Then sell a bunch of ebooks about investing, growing your penis size, and getting women with one weird old tip.

Yes we will all die someday - taking chances and risks is good - but I won't put my life savings on the roulette wheel as a result. That would limit further risk taking pretty damn quick.

My point is, with roulette, as your number of spins approaches infinity or (even 1,000) --- you're virtually guaranteed to lose.
With bitcoin you aren't necessarily guaranteed to lose --- I mean, you very well may be, but probability only accounts for known information.
