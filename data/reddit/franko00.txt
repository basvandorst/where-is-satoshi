I am so sorry to hear how you suffered through something so terrible. It is not your fault, sounds like your boss made big mistake hiring the woman who was loyal to the tyrannical government, you tried your best to warn him, if only he would have listened to you. :(
I am happy to help though, just sent you a PM.

Shut up slut.

Could be an EPIC BCH and BSV dump. :) if the price of either starts going down in the next 24 hours he is starting the dump. If the price drops are small, just means he is selling in tiny chunks over the next year.

They probably are going to keep your clean money and pay you your interest or whatever with dirty money from hacked accounts (which they paid only a small amount for) that will be charged back in a couple weeks, and then YOU are the one who will be in trouble + out whatever money you paid them (which is a total loss since your dirty money all got taken back from your account).
Stop trying to rationalize and make excuses to invest anyway. This IS a scam. If not the method I described, they'll do it another way...Maybe even a combination of multiple methods.

No problem, glad you found it helpful. Sorry if I worded my reply a bit abrasively, just wanted to make sure the message got through to you 100%, I hate to see good guys lose even a single dollar.

Give this man a fucking medal. Seriously, thank you for all of your work.

Hopefully he will now dump the BCH and BSV straight into the buy orders and crash the price of both to $4.��
