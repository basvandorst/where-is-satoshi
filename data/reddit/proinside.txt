A short story about diversification for you:
Diversification is the idea behind the classical portfolio selection theory developed by Markowitz. It said you could spread/eliminate the unsystematic risk by diversifying your assets, given the expected rate of return and the risk (standard variation).
Now the thing is, to reduce the risk on the portfolio you are holding, you would need assets that have a correlation of 0 or, even better, negative correlation to that of the market.
Taking a quick look at how crypto currencies are working and how they behave to the general market (i.e. a portfolio of the biggest cryptos) you can clearly see that they are all positively correlated, meaning you can't eliminate your risk by investing into different cryptos. You can maybe reduce the amount of wealth you loose, since not every crypto reacts in the same extremes, but you will lose/gain money whenever the market portfolio says so.
To actually reduce the risk, you would need contrary running cryptos. Maybe a stable coin of some sorts could do this. But most likely they would loose their expected rate of return too when the market drops.
TL;DR: you can't diversify by buying altcoins as long as they are correlated to BTC/Eth/etc prices. You can however reduce the amount of wealth you loose when the market goes down.

When living in germany, you can try the new bison app. 
Powered by an actually exchange (Stuttgarter Börse) and I believe with cooperation of several banks. So no scam there and under regulation.
