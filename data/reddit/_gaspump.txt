Thanks. It really is quite beautiful and although I understand the value temptation to crack it open I couldn't bear to do it myself. I never take it out of its little plastic case, but I do like to admire it from time to time.  I'm hoping I can eventually find a good home for it, but that monetary value alone makes shipping it anywhere a risky proposition. Which in turn puts some hard limits what I can really do with this thing.

I will never have children let alone grand children.
Doing an auction sounds feasible but also complicated.  Still looking into that!
Edit: I do not ever touch the coin.  It came to me in a protective container and it has stayed in that save for a rare couple of photo ops.  Being where I am, I can't get it ANACS graded.  I've reached out to local coin dealers and gotten silence in response.  Gooooo Canannnnanida. :p

I can't get it ANACS rated.  See above.
I won't sell by FeeBay.  See above.

"flaunting" anything is not my style.  It would be an anonymous showing or bust.
Thankfully I really am in a position where it doesn't matter.  Hence why I'm having such a hard time trying to figure out the best way to handle this thing.  It's a beautiful coin, truly, with a healthy heft but... so much baggage.

Feebay is out of the question.  If I got, say $20k CAD I'd get $15k after all the Ebay and Paypal fees.  Not doing that.

Flattery will get you... well, everywhere but bitcoins!
Heavy burden is a good way of putting it.  I had honestly almost forgotten about it completely until a friend of mine was like "Hey, you do bitcoin things, did you see it hit $10k?
I like the thought of lending it out for display at museums that feature coins... I never thought about that route either.  That one is very interesting to me... I'd love to have something of mine be a "museum piece"!

Already did that.  Except the box was my desk drawer. :P

$25k (CAD).  That's the current sum of BTC and BCC + numismatic value.
And yeah, it does belong in a museum.  It is a) absolutely beautiful and b) historic.
That's why it's now kinda scary for me to have!
Edit: I'd rather sell to someone who wants to do what I did and just stack it away somewhere... keep it pristine.  There's really not many of these left.  I try to get a feel for the value but all the casascius coins are burned.
