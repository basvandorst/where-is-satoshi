bitcoin is very political.

An uncorruptable decentralized money system means pure 100% capitalism with 0% socialism. Its defunds evil at the source. It will give us a pure ethical planet with no scalable method to fund evil. I think money is at the key to unlocking our future.

Too broad of a brush. The corrupt part is the FED.

The banks of the federal reserve have government power. They are the government, and thus they are in fact "government owned" by definition.


The government does not regulate restaurants to the same degree as it does banks. 
If food could only come from one of 5 central restaurants, who had to each centrally report and review the exact amount consumed by each individual, and it was illegal to get food from any other source, then you would be approaching something comparable.

Monopoly or "monopoly cartel" are the most accurate if you are pretending they are private. Considering that the power of the treasury has been granted to the Fed, its more accurate to just call them a "bureau" or "agency" of government.


The ability to run a datacenter is not reserved to a shadowy wing of government like banking is.

Who cares about "blockchain"? 
There is bitcoin, the others are just useless or at worse scams.


Lol, and your "interchain" is different ??
Or maybe you are full of it.

There is nothing stupid about it. 
What is speculative about the best investment performance of the decade?
If any stock or ETF or traditional commodity performed like bitcoin did, each and every person in that stupid sub would be pumping it similarly. 
Instead, they are expressing their abiding butthurt.
I wonder how long it takes for people to realize that bitcoin is just as stable and predictable as any commodity asset.

Hammers are politically neutral. Bitcoin and hammers are not the same at all. Its a network protocol dictating interactions between people, not a one player item. Bitcoin is like a magic hammer that wont work for the government. If you cant see that, you are an idiot or else pulling wool over your own eyes.

How can you possibly think that? Bitcoin is going to kill inflation, and that will make the world a much better place.

Youtube is being politicized.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:52:24


You can do all that without "interchain"


The way

Its easier to secure than a traditional bank account. 


From a societal standpoint perhaps. But there is no such thing as a "beta" software product that has a over 10 billion dollar bug bounty, and withstood a world of attacks for a decade.


Goes for all investments.


Sure you are.

A good start, but it all falls apart here:


Lincoln's creation, the greenback,  an unbacked government fiat, was and is just as bad as whatever dollar the fed prints. It serves the same pupose: to take power over and control the people of the country. To make war and domestic conquest.
There is nothing good about government fiat; its no better to have the government run the money system than to let some shady mystery bankers do it; it works out to be the same thing.
If we want freedom of money, then the money system cannot be centrally owned, controlled, and manipulated by anyone.

They are the state.

food got a lot cheaper due to automation and technology.
The dollar was still devalued, but there is more than one factor at play.

What do you think makes something public? The advantages of political power is the only thing that separates "public" from "private".
There is nothing "private" about banking.
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:55:15


No, its really not. Bitcoin has a very specific political stance, and you can read about it in the genesis block. 
As a tool, and as a technology, bitcoin is very political; it is coded to be a certain way, and that design confounds certain groups.
@_date: 2019-12-16 01:04:29


Post was good up till this point. There is no need for any kind of "interchain" or what not. People just need to control their own keys and the problem will sort itself out naturally.
@_date: 2019-12-26 17:52:13
Did your brain short circuit or something? Remember "Bitcoin serves everyone equally" you said it yourself. Thats political, highly.
@_date: 2019-12-24 23:16:43
The bank shills are dominating the comments. Censoring is part of the plan, unleashing hordes of shills for the monetary status quo is another. 
"Bitcoin wont solve any problems" is sounding more and more like "Ignore the man behind the curtain".
@_date: 2019-12-24 23:19:13


Private banks are illegal, and have been for over 100 years. Banking is highly regulated; you have to be a predatory wing of state to operate a bank at all.
@_date: 2019-12-16 03:43:05


then you would be saving and consuming less, while gambling that other people will invest wisely and improve the economy. Its a great deal, and a perfectly fair investment to make.

Thats the key to its politics: serving everyone equally. The two main camps of thought are the politics of special treatment vs the politics of equality.
By serving everyone equally, bitcoin is opposing all the forces of "special treatment for some at the expense of others".
This is the key dichotomy in politics; and bitcoin has taken a side. It is hyper political.
Bitcoin gives privacy and control to the invidual, and no court order can override it. If you believe the police should be able to monitor your every transaction, then bitcoin would be a problem.
Those who believe in a centrally administered money system, which enables the modern welfare system, would find sound money like bitcoin to be a major impediment as well. While a bank can track and report, and confiscate every penny its customers hold, bitcoin only honors individual will. A bank can also steal from all by simply printing new supply, and that is at the heart of every governments spending plan.
For each political policy, ask yourself "Is this something which treats every individual equally, or treats some differently than others?" It will be clear whicch side bitcoin chooses.
