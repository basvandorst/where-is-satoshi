Oh please, you all need to chill. Doubt, fear and uncertainty are in place. No one knows what will happen. 
The opposite is blindly believing that btc will make us all rich and will liberate the world and make the grass greener. Take it easy, fokes. In both directions.

Since the price of btc is very very unstable, some users would maybe be angry ("he god the game for 1/4 of the price I paid!"). One way would be to make the price a function of the usd/btc price, rounded up to bitcents. That would make sure everyone pays about the same "real" price (assuming they get their salaries in fiat).

The worst thing is the community. People are so caught up in their gold rush that they fail to understand the interesting technical details of bitcoin, they fail to see different perspective on economic theory and they fail in seeing really anything else but "bitcoin is the best ever and will forever be best for everything imagineable".

Yes and no. Theese of us who have been along for a while, and anyone with a tad of realism, knows that the price fluctates a lot. It will be &lt;50% of current price, and &gt;100%. Don't invest your house in it, the last time the price has risen like this have been disasterous for some. 
Take it easy and enjoy the new economy :)

No no no, internet laws??? We have to protect our freedoms, but the ones holding it back are the gatekeepers (ISP's, meatspace govs).
