this dip was also across lots of alts as well not just bitcoin.

I get that everyone here is against bch takin money away from btc, but is no one goin to buy up any cheap bch when it tanks to sell back later at a higher price. 
There are definitely going to be new people that come to Coinbase and see another coin that has bit coin in the name and is cheaper than Bitcoin core and I imagine eventually the price will go up again. 
And you can totally use that money to buy more bitcoin core.

Eh. Watching 20 billion leave the space that quickly was enough to make everyone else in this post dig around to figure out what was going on.  so.... definitely no need for apologies.

How do you look at that on gdax. I don't use this exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:09:59
It's an off day for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:13:02
everyone should just go ahead and move on to other coins and let this dinosaur go.

I hear everyone is selling their bch for eth.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:09:26
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:19:50
bitcoin cash got hit on that one too.
I was watching eth and it dipped down about 20% of its price.
everything dropped all at once.

And while we are watching this the GOP passes their tax reform bill, I'm pretty sure if I don't become a billionaire off of cryptocurrency that tax bill is going to end up fucking me over somehow.

btw anyone here have a job? you guys off for the holidays? or are you watching this at work right now?
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:21:29
check all the alts.  that was a weird dip.  but then the whole crypto space lost about 20 billion all at once so..... fuck it. it will all be up in a month anyway right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:23:03
oh yeah man, I'm with you. At the end of the day this is all about making that money.  
$2.84 is a good run.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:27:36
I really hope your boss is sitting there waiting and watching too.
that would be classic.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:15:29
btc is also like iphone.  greatly over hyped.  
eth forever.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:07:49
Seriously. All I've been able to find is the btc/bch pairing on their exchange but I'd like to see the orders.

Which one is the guy with horseshoes?

quick run up on Bitcoin Cash.  For a little while last night it was more profitable for miners to to mine Bitcoin Cash so they switched to BCC some money got thrown from BTC to BCC and then after about an hour things went back to the way they were.  I watched most of it happen BCC-BTC went from about .105 BTC for 1 BCC to around .16 BTC for 1 BCC and then everything stabilized again.
It looked like a tiny version of the whales unloading BCC for BTC that happened last weekend.
