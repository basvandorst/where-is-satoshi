Yes and how are fiber optics cables laid in the ocean? Is it one cable? Or massive amount of cables laid down. The internet wasn't limited by 1 strand of copper cable, they used thick and multiple cables before upgrading to optic. Limiting bitcoin with 1 mb block size is like laying a single optical cable in the ocean or like having a single copper wire while waiting for fiber optic to come out

LOL, that's actually how the internet grew.... More and thicker cables... Without them the internet wouldn't function. With your comparison bitcoin cash is the better technology.

Yes it will be. the lightning network developers themselves said we need bigger blocks for large scale Lightning network adoption...

it's one of the cringiest things i've seen in a long time. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:43:03
what you just said is not relevant. To enable 7 billion people to make two channels per year we need 133 mb blocks. How do you think bitcoin can function on 1 mb blocks when one company managed to cripple it. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:53:26
The community isn't against it. Blockstream is against it because the only way they can profit from bitcoin is by limiting the main chain and pushing second layer solutions which they profit off of. 
The only people that don't support blocksize increases are blockstream shills and people that bought into their propaganda. Bitcoin users only gain from a blocksize increase, cheaper fees, faster transaction times and a higher bitcoin price because people can actually use it.
The 1 mb blocksize was an arbitrary number satoshi picked. If he chose 500kb blockstream would be spreading propaganda that 1 mb upgrade is too big and will harm the network. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:42:59
Everything in your comment is incorrect. 


Bitcoin cash has bigger blocks which operate cheaper and quicker then bitcoin does. If bitcoin had 8 mb blocks we wouldn't have experienced this massive fee/time influx over the last couple months. If bitcoin cash didn't have bigger blocks and only removed segwit then I would agree with you.


Litecoin is the definition of a shitcoin. It takes all of bitcoins failed scaling attempts and puts them into a second coin. Litecoin is more expensive and slower to transact. It's own creator doesn't believe in it...
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:50:44
No, bigger block sizes do not impact users negatively in any way. The only thing expensive is the current 1 mb blocksize 
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:02:31
Average users do not run a node. Running a none mining node does not benefit the network despite what blockstream propaganda has led you to believe. 
If you're so set on running a node you will save money buying a bigger hardrive and better internet connection to support the bigger 8mb network then sending a couple transactions on the 1 mb network.

You can scale bitcoin in multiple ways. You don't need to use only one method. If mainchain bitcoin isn't scaled second layer solutions won't be able to operate. 8mb blocks would fix bitcoins current scaling problems for the foreseeable future while second layer solutions are worked on. 
With just linear scaling 1 gb blocks have been tested and should work. 
1mb blocks and the lightning network won't work for large scaling. It might help relieve the network temporarily but the main chain will still be clogged with even higher fees then seen before. 
Sticking to an arbitrary number that satoshi chose for block size is extremely stupid. If he chose 500kb blocks you would be arguing with me that 1 mb blocks are too big. There isn't a single good argument against a small blocksize increase unless you're blockstream trying to limit bitcoin.

He said that bitcoin cash or bitcoin would hit those numbers. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:28:01
yes bitcoin core is currently bitcoin because of the greater hash power. It does not change the fact that bitcoin cash is true to the original chain and white paper. 
Lmfao at calling me a shill. I'm equally invested in both. You need to be a retard to not see how bitcoin is shooting itself in the foot. Are you one of those retards that sold all his bitcoin cash or are you a late investor? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:09:53


They have done nothing useful/of importance in the last couple of years. 


larger blocks isn't outdated code. It's one of the ways bitcoin is supposed to scale.


Technically the coin known as "bitcoin" currently is the fork. Bitcoin cash is the original chain.

bitcoin currently has no advantages over it.

Name any major useful upgrades they have done? Segwit? just lol


You need 133mb blocks + for the lightning network to operate on a world wide scale....
"If all Bitcoin transactions were conducted inside a network of micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require 133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage."

I'm assuming a late investor with less then 7 figures invested. LOL. Peasants will never learn. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:03:49
LOL, being so retarded that you sell off all your bitcoin cash. Then try to call someone else delusional. Keep investing/arguing based of emotions and propaganda fed to you by blockstream. 
You do understand the lightning network won't be able to function with a clogged main chain? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:37:13
I never argued that the lightning network is a bad scaling solution. It's just not enough. The lightning developers themselves said bitcoin will need 133 mb blocks along side the lightning network to operate normally. 


It's not a short term fix. Bitcoin needs bigger blocks along with other scaling solutions. Users won't be able to fund the lightning network if the main chain is clogged. No average user will be using the lightning network if it costs them $500 to fund it and another $500 to close it. $500 fees will happen sooner then you think if we don't scale the mainchain. 
This "dirty fix" would fix bitcoins scaling problems for the foreseeable future. There isn't a single good reason not to raise the blocksize
