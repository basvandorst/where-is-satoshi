I don't care that much.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:41:37
Why is it not legal?  I pay $10 for your wallet that you can't get to right now. (example)  Nothing about that at all sounds illegal to me.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:31:12
@_date: 2014-05-01 16:49:53
Big news!
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:28:40
I had the official bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:41:26
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:48:17
His reverse psychology worked! Look at all his tips!
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:06:04
Fucking bastards.
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:55:08
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:40:54
Ugh.  How'd they find him this time?
@_date: 2014-08-25 04:15:20
California sucks.
@_date: 2014-11-28 23:50:26
Interesting, but can they be trusted?
@_date: 2014-05-27 16:11:36
Keep working!
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:12:23
@_date: 2014-09-01 15:43:30
You can use gyft to get whole foods gift cards with bitcoin already!
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:23:19
Glad you saved your coins!
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:06:50
Why are they the enemy? 
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:27:25
I don't trust people that are super enthusiastic or super negative without any sort of logic/evidence.  So I am still unsure.
@_date: 2014-04-07 16:41:49
Also anyone know if insurance will cover BTC since the IRS ruled it was property?
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:07:39
@_date: 2014-04-07 17:03:58


I might use that in the future.
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:07:09
Close call.
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:03:05
Because this business model is dependent on subscribers with fixed payments rather than a coin with a fluctuating price.  And I imagine they mine with their excess hash...
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:36:54
You as a customer buy 100gh/s for a year for example, but their machines can do 1000gh/s so they probably mine with 900gh/s that is leftover.  Its a dual income stream.  That is what I would do at least if I was running a cloudhashing company.
@_date: 2014-11-21 17:23:30
Nice ad.  That should be ran on some other sites...
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:46:15
So are they essentially an escrow service?
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:57:26
Can you explain?
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:33:27
Yeah I don't have a backup unfortunately, just changed my pool password and added a new wallet address.
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:24:46
1. No
2. It was saved in google chrome passwords
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:38:00
I appreciate your transparency.  I hope a solution can be found that puts to rest some of the community concern about 51% mining power.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:46:06
Hopefully y'all can get your $$$ out, I got mine out about a month ago seeing all of the rumors going on about Mt Gox.  
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:15:00
Nice try bing.
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:27:37
Well it was at 51% the other day so the 38% it is showing now doesn't seem like a big deal to me...
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:07:25
I don't remember
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:02:18
Why does it matter if a non US citizen buys shit from Cuba?
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:14:34
Well I wish I had known that they ran a shoddy business before sending my BTC there...  :(
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:33:09
back at you.
@_date: 2014-07-18 04:34:37
Classic New York. We don't need your fucking permission to do shit on the Internet.  Bitcoin was created to FREE us from people like you. Come and Take It.
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:34:53
I show 49%.  Perhaps some miners are quickly switching to P2Pool?
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:42:18
Pretty pumped to see it gaining again!
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:26:12
Creative. I want one.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:05:39
Has Ghash issued any news on plans they have?
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:49:55
lol good, not my miners.
@_date: 2014-12-27 16:24:57
These guys look awkward as fuck.  It could have been a lot better.
@_date: 2014-04-07 16:54:26
No, that was dumb of me.  I might have my computer backed up on cloud storage but I don't know how up to date it was.
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:08:19
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:58:55
Wish I had bought some.
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:18:55
What is the next paypal?  Paypal already has a massive established userbase that could change things for bitcoin on a scale never seen before.
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:24:20
They said its not covered :(
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:24:17
Why would it reduce fees?  It was made by a massive corporation that does things to make money...  I don't think Apple Pay ever promised to reduce fees, that wasn't the point of it.
@_date: 2014-04-07 21:30:08

Vote him out.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:39:51
I like their price on a particular ASIC miner but I have no idea whether they are a scam company or not...
@_date: 2014-07-25 20:46:31
So hoodrats are going to embrace bitcoin now? That's cool I guess...
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:55:45
Thanks for this resource!
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:25:26
Fuck yeah.
@_date: 2014-11-02 22:59:50
Sure why not
@_date: 2014-07-26 01:55:19
Neato! Keep on keeping on SJW!
@_date: 2014-06-12 19:09:47
Very nice.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:44:26
@_date: 2014-06-28 18:31:10
That would be incredible.  I'd buy that app.
@_date: 2014-06-28 14:44:19
Make one for mintpal or cryptsy.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:47:22
You are the delusional one.  Go read Trust Me I'm Lying.
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:56:13
@_date: 2014-08-23 13:44:46
Or you could stop being a fucking douchebag.
@_date: 2014-04-07 16:54:36
What is a seed?
@_date: 2014-07-26 00:47:59
Sorry I hurt your little feelings!
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:45:23
So does Mt Gox not allow USD withdrawals?
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:39:02
Reporters are just as bad as politicians.  Don't trust them EVER. Their ONLY job is to make headlines that will get eyeballs on the story so they can make ad money.  This usually means sensationalized headlines and stories or whatever it takes to make it controversial.  Retractions are always late and on a page no one reads.
@_date: 2014-10-22 14:26:22
How would it be 9% more?  I would understand like 3% since there are no transaction fees of significance...
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:43:31
I want some.
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:59:43
How so?  I have a couple grand worth of miners and I withdraw payouts every other week to buy things on Amazon...
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:45:59
More good news!
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:59:03
Yikes.  Mostly this was hypothetical.  I just wanted to see if it was possible.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:49:33
I got my antminers on slush's pool.
@_date: 2014-11-24 13:30:07
Still don't know what to believe but I stopped putting more money into GAW.
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:56:43
I have a verified account already with tax forms...
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:53:57
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:54:17
So how is it different from like Coinbase or cryptsy?
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:12:01
This could end well or go horribly.
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:44:18
lol epic troll
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:28:19
Nice.  First good news in a while.
@_date: 2015-01-05 15:21:01
This post is dumb.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:52:45
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:58:29
Smart.  It will go back up.
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:39:49
If it goes under $100, I'm buying.
@_date: 2015-01-12 20:59:53
Oh, lovely.
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:43:49
uhhh I'll take a tip...
@_date: 2015-01-05 14:54:10
Well, shit.
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:01:29
They don't give you HP for upvotes anymore.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:59:55
So did you pay up?
@_date: 2014-09-18 15:12:03
I wanted to see what they were before giving them my personal info.
@_date: 2015-01-03 22:44:03
Starting to feel really dumb for going with GAW for so long.  I did make good money for a while, but think I am going to lose all of my converted hashlets in the XPY collapse.
@_date: 2015-01-12 04:46:07
What is the tl;dr?  I missed this.
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:08:49
I really like Gyft.  I use BTC on amazon gift cards since I already shop there, and I get BTC back because they save on their processing fee.  Super easy!
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:38:54
This could get interesting.
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:46:42
How are they able to offer a higher discount than Gyft?
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:43:57
Never pay for checking.  Ever.
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:08:54
Pretty good article.
@_date: 2015-01-07 23:32:03
After a crash...
@_date: 2016-01-11 22:05:17
whoah, didn't even realize you could get suspended... I thought they just shadowban you...
@_date: 2016-01-12 14:39:42
I don't really care enough to read.  Reddit is already on the  way to becoming Digg, nobody comes here anymore.
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:53:13
lol are you serious?
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:00:28
This sounds great.
@_date: 2015-08-27 15:58:03
Is it another one owned by Josh Garza?
@_date: 2015-09-14 19:17:45
Good fuck him.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:11:47
@_date: 2015-11-10 21:18:58
wtf is that supposed to mean?
@_date: 2015-11-11 19:34:29
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:02:18
That motherfucker is rich as fuck.
@_date: 2015-03-03 15:56:24
Good.  Worth my BTC that was stolen.
@_date: 2015-10-21 15:58:06
Any way we know this site won't end up being another ponzi that collapses like GAW or the countless others that have ran with the BTC?
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:42:52
A ton of us already had stakers (which you can't sell on their market).  So we are kind of stuck getting daily payouts.
@_date: 2015-11-10 19:57:13
How do they ensure seller and buyer protections?
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:50:17
I was pretty into bitcoin around 2013-2014 and lost interest when the price tanked.
@_date: 2015-11-10 20:40:15
no idea what that means
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:40:31
Yep I have transfered funds from zenminer to Paybase and they never show up, also can't withdraw from Paybase.  Timing with the first stakers ending seems highly suspicious.
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:43:09
I'd be fine with using one.  What poker site do you recommend?
@_date: 2015-02-02 17:02:14
What poker sites work with this tracker and also take Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-08 06:40:04
How do you even use the qr code?
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:53:43
Great cause.  Hope you reach your goal!
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:59:43
If you didn't sell when it broke $1k, you're dumb.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:44:40
I'll do this when I get home tonight.  Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:37:09
Installed a new wallet program and it automatically found em!  Just sold em for a nice little profit!
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:09:51
Here is a screenshot...I can't find that file...
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:34:20
Lucky bastard
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:01:33
Computer techs are gonna be stealing bitcoins off of every computer they fix with this lol
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:45:05
How exactly do you back it up?  Just make a copy?
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:17:05
The program didn't even open... is this something that would happen before it opens?
