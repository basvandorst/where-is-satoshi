So what are the odds that this is not VISA taking global regulation action against this business? Because if there are sources to back up the fact that MCO will “survive” this, I am ordering one 100%.

Xapo and TenX are also affected then. Probably the end to bitcoin credit/debit cards?

Just came from visiting that sub and holyfuck, anything that doesn't praise BCH gets downvoted to oblivion. It's insane to see the difference between subs, really makes me think.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:16:31
Yes it will support the split. And Electrum 3.0 saying it supports segwit means they support the softfork of segwit, which means faster transaction times and lower fees, along with the new addresses (starting with a 3, instead of 1).

Have you tried making it return True?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:06:30
If BCH is "the new go to crypto for transactions", then what purpose does BTC serve? lol.  
It's a fight till death.
Edit due to downvotes: I'm just saying both can't survive, not supporting BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:03:49
That's like betting on both teams on a soccer match. Either BTC or BCH will get destroyed, highly doubt they both survive like nothing.

You can also put it on a computer at work, probably not the best idea though.
If you are asking about a mobile app or similar, not from Exodus. You can just note down the coins you have and download a coin tracker for your phone.
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:43:17
This is exactly how I feel about crypto. I'm holding a large part of my portfolio in BTC, probably around 85% BTC, 10% in ETH and rest in 2-3 alts.
Correct me if I'm wrong but, I don't see much of a reason with the "diversify" on crypto. Lets be honest, if BTC went to shit in X way, chances are everything would go to shit, not just BTC.  So it's now a matter of picking the coin that does the best at its job, such as BTC as a form of payment, or such as ETH to build stuff on top of it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:42:03
If you are able to identify every dip and every pump, the amount you invest in is irrelevant, it's about the ROI. If you are able to consistently do it, then go for it.
The good old "buy low sell high" reality will hit you at some point though, it's easy to identify these dips when you are just holding and think "damn if I sold and bought at a lower price", but when it comes to actually doing it, it's a different story.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:28:58
Never heard about it. What's your experience with it? Looks very nice on paper.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:10:59
First step is to download a wallet and move all of it to an exchange that is supported in your country. You'll have to go through some ID verification to make everything legal, and so your government will tax it. Simple as that.

I'm fairly sure both will come up with a quick solution to split your coins effectively after the fork, however I'll always recommend a HW wallet over Electrum.

Quoting You can verify the applications against their Open Source code and the isolation against the principles described in  - this validation method ("certification by composition") is leveraging on a technology that has been validated for security critical markets since the first banking cards were created in the 1980s
When you buy a hardware product you didn't build yourself, you always have to trust at least the chip manufacturer and the product manufacturer. By using Secure Elements, we make sure that you don't have to trust any other party in the chain.

No, you did nothing wrong. It's just the way of displaying in which chain your coins are at, but I'm assuming since the fork has not happened yet, it just displays the current BTC you own on the segwit address, along with the legacy USD value of your coins at the time.
My guess is, when the fork happens, they will allow you to use this part of the software to use and separate your S2X coins from the original BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:20:59
I don't mean to come off as rude or anything but I really don't see the point of funding the project with BTC, you are most likely going to convert it to FIAT to buy the equipment. It's great that you are doing this but if you really care about the cause, you would create a crowdfunding page, I think you have a better shot with the traditional way.
Good luck.

There'll be a bit of everything I guess, yes.

I'd assume that due to the Bitcoin Gold fork, everyone is moving their BTC between platforms that do not support segwit.

Wonder what's the procedure if the issues come AFTER the delivery of the item. I'm interested in making orders on purse.io in which I'd save considerable amounts (items over $1000) but that's holding me back.

Sorry to ask here but it's irrelevant on which chain of the nano S I'm storing the coins right?

Just because reddit doesn't get their shit together it doesn't mean it is "the dark side" of Bitcoin or "a disadvantage". Your best shot is to keep contacting Reddit, if the transaction already went through CoinBase, they did their job.
This is one of the features that makes Bitcoin so good, not having a third-party decide whether or not you get to keep your money as a vendor (AKA PayPal fucking you in the ass, etc).
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:33:44
Sometimes coinbase says they sent a transaction but they have not broadcasted it. Does it display a transaction ID on Coinbase? If not, it's not been "sent" yet.
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:48:32
USDT exists so people can hold "cash" in crypto that is also pegged at the rate of currency people already trust, the US dollar. This alleviates volatility concerns over putting your coin into something else, like BTC or whatever.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:47:33
Correct. Look for an actual exchange. I would only see coinbase as a platform to buy crypto with FIAT, or to withdraw my crypto to FIAT. I would never consider coinbase for daily trading. There are tons of exchanges out there: Bittrex, Poloniex, GDAX, etc. 
Every one with their pros and cons, not a daily trader myself so can't help you there, however fees between those exchanges shouldn't be too different and they should be much more affordable than doing it through Coinbase. 
Good luck with your journey and welcome!
