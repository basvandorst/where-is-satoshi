Hey, thanks, yea I am using electrum wallet, it was enabled, I guess I just didn't see it. I didn't try right clicking :p
but yea increased the fee up to around 60s/byte before I went to bed and it confirmed overnight.
I usually use the second notch for fees on electrum, but was tight on budget this time, and the last time I did it with minimum fees, it only took a couple hrs, not a day. added to the paranoia of sending to a new wallet that I never before used, was worried it might have been lost to the ether.

What? takes me like 5 minutes to create an account to get some bitcoin. Or a 20 minute drive to the local BTC seller, which accepts cash.
So unless you live in the middle of nowhere with no internet, I don't see how snailmail can be mailed faster. And if you are that far in the boonies, your prolly not going to be able to overnight any packages anyway.

To be fair, I have boycotted USA. Sorry, but I won't even make a stopover flight there. Its literally the only country I will spend extra to avoid, so unless other countries are doing it, USA can keep their draconian policies at the border.

I think it was in the mid 40 sat/byte range that I paid. Its been almost 10 or so hrs. I am in no rush I just want to make sure it makes it there before sunday afternoon. I confirmed the address, etc, ive just never seen it take this long b4. Longest ive seen it take before is maybe 2 hours.  Honestly prolly good having it in the ether, as its more likely to moon hahah
