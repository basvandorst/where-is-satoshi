Got recuva running a deep scan at the moment, will try this if it fails. It happened about an hour ago, ive only downloaded multibit and 2 recovery softwares since it happened so I'm hoping for the best

I got a data recovery company to take a look at my hard drive. He's managed to get the Appdata bitcoin folder and the wallet.dat file, but it looks corrupt and he didn't know how to verify.
Do you think I should try installing Bitcoin Core again and replacing the appdata with the recovered data? Or do you have any other suggestions?
I should point out that my blockchain never finished downloading so my transaction to bitcoin core wallet never appeared, but I guess that's a non-issue?

Yeah hence I'm "feeling like a proper idiot" (see above).

would you mind reading over my response below to and    see if you've got any suggestions?

Thanks for the help.
I actually deleted all the appdata from the recycle bin and can't recover it now.
So I think my bitcoin is gone for good, but thanks anyway.

Seeing as I deleted Bitcoin core I guess this is not an option anymore?
Unless I can restore it somehow?

Yeah I was too hasty, a number of factors led to this amazing mistake.
1. I read that it's good to get your coin out of the exchange fairly quickly.
2. I sent it to my core address without really understanding core, I just looked for the most popular 'wallet'.
3. When I couldn't download the whole blockchain, nor see my bitcoin in core, I panicked and thought I better get safe on a lighter wallet - and quick.
4. Drive was completely full so after exporting my transactions as a csv, I thought it would be safe to clear the space and reinstate on new wallet.
It's easy to see now that number 4 was my biggest assumption and I hadn't done my proper research. I'm normally more diligent than this...
