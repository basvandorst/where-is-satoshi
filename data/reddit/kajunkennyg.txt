You don't need to dump 5k btc a month to live. Just washing 20 btc a month and depending where you live on earth, you are comfy. And doing that amount is feasible.

Way more work when what I posted would get the job done easier. If the hacker burned 50k btc here gets to keep 70k btc, he could start washing equal amounts to everyone else and if for some reason he was questioned, he could pretend to be one of the lucky ones that got free coins.

I mean what if the guy just sends like 100 btc to 500 people? That will give anyone researching this a lot of coins to monitor and while those people try to mix/wash/withdraw their btc, he washes his in the mix. Seems like a solid plan. Instead of making someone look at 1 persons activity, make them watch a bunch of people's activity. Seems like a smart plan to me.

Edmund, I have a question. I stumbled across a video sometime back talking about the following. Say I was going to lease you a car. Using the bitcoin network (I'm guessing a service like yours would be involved plus some additional hardware) we setup a transaction. You pay me X bitcoin per month and the network will allow your key to operate the car. You fail to pay and the car reverts back to me. At that time I can lease the car to someone else. 
So how far away is something like this? I'd really like to look into this. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 08:56:48
There is some balance here. Notice how you need to give all your info to buy on coinbase? I'm sure they keep record of that. If asked they will give that up. 
Ever wonder why you can buy $100 walmart/amazon/etc gift cards for $50 or less in bitcoin? Maybe that's because someone doesn't want it on the record. 
I'm happy buying that stuff at a discount. I don't care if the guy is a drug dealer converting to bitcoin or some guy who just likes his privacy. It's not my job to figure it out. 
Just like anyone whose bought a brand new ipad off of craigslist for half the price and it's brand news. Your lying to yourself if you think the sob story is real. 99% of the time they used stolen credit cards to buy that shit that same day. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 06:01:27

I know this is possible. How will it be brought mainstream? I've heard it mentioned that this stuff can be added on top, etc..etc. Whose doing it? When can it happen? I'm sorry if this exist already, I don't get to read the sub daily. 
Reason I ask is because I watched a video where the guy spoke about being able to lease/rent out cars or any item that could have a "card" type thing attached to it. Something that connects to the blockchain and once a payment is received someone can then operate the vehicle. Something along those lines. I'm really interested in this. Imagine being able to put a card reader on a rental property or hotel room and being able to rent that room without having to check in. You pay, use your key that the blockchain now allows you to access for the next 24 hours or whatever and boom. 
These are just examples and stuff I would like to get involved in. I hope my point is clear, I haven't had enough coffee this morning.

I've been hearing in all the trading circles that people expect a drop because of the china thing. So, some traders are sitting in fiat and some nervous people will cash out once they see it dropping a tad which will cause it to drop even further. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:39:12
I've used bitcoin to get awesome deals on stuff. For example, netflix for a year for $11, starbucks giftcards for 60% off and other such deals. I've learned years ago to take some off the top and get even or some profit. Playing the long game can shoot someone in the foot. Being able to buy stuff for great deals just seems like a huge win-win to me. 
I'm in the profit with bitcoin and still have a nice stash. When I calculate profit I add up what I spent to buy bitcoin and what I spent buying stuff. Getting great deals is just icing on the cake. 
Also, using bitcoin for commerce increases the value.

While the price of bitcoin does jump around a bit, you can bypass this by using coinbase or bitpay and having it converted to fiat immediately. Considering you are running a startup, I recommend converting to fiat as you will need the cash available immediately.

I'll just chime in on marketing in general. There's no way you could do a nationwide billboard campaign for 400k. You could advertise in one major city and that's about it. 
Not saying this is a good idea, but I think it would make news if the bitcoin community decided to sponsor a bowl game. I'm pretty sure that would be the first time in history that a sporting event would be crowd funded. So would the 400k be worth it? Sure. Could it be better spent? Possibly.

I'm sure this will piss off most of the fan boys in this sub. Yet, I'll post it anyway. Since trading has becomes less profitable, I've found that using bitcoin I can get sick deals on stuff. For example, I buy a bitcoin for $500. Usually I can buy stuff that I need anyway and turn that $500 into $800+ worth of stuff. Doing this I have made a nice little profit recently. So, why just sit on bitcoin. Why not use it and increase your stash. All while helping the bitcoin economy? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:27:00

Just keep smaller amounts in a secondary coinbase account. A truck driver friend of mine use to deliver to some shady parts of major cities. He would always keep like $40 in small bills (big wad with a bunch of bills) in his pocket. Anytime he got robbed (which was pretty often) he would just hand them that wad of money and say something like, "that's all I got!" 
Most of the time they would take it an run without harming him or anything. So the same thing here applies.

I hate the Myth that a business accepting bitcoin is business suicide. I've seen that posted way to many times. It's like people don't understand that they convert to fiat immediately in most cases. I've had people ask me what the point is if that's the case, like we in the bitcoin community don't understand that they can't just keep bitcoins until they can use it to pay employees, buy from vendors, etc..etc. They miss the point that the cycle needs to begin somewhere and we are happy that bitcoin gains buying power, even if it is converted just like EURO's would be (here in the USA.)
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:10:35
I don't think we need to regulate cryptocurrencies. We need to regulate those businesses that control the private keys of other peoples coins. 
As far as regulating bitcoin on some level. I don't think it's time for that at this point. We need to let the technology grow and see what happens, sort of like we did with the internet. 
The worst thing that can ever happen is to allow bitoins competition to finance the law making. If banks, credit card companies and/or western union get their way, they will stamp out bitcoin just to hold onto their profits.

If you aren't spending your coins then you are missing out on some great deals. I routinely look for ways to spend bitcoin. I can usually save anywhere from 5-50% or more on stuff by using bitcoin. So, I simply spend it and buy more. I am not saying to use your entire cold storage. I keep some there too, I keep some in a hot wallet so when I find a deal, I jump on it. Then I buy more and add a few dollars to my "spending wallet" while saving some cash from my pocket. 
So, I am increasing my net worth, helping the daily volume and proving that the system is viable. Every once in a while I'll add an extra coin or two to my cold wallet. All from my savings. And when I do that I usually bring my family out to eat steaks or boil up some good Louisiana crawfish. All paid for by my bitcoin activities. 
I wish everyone did this. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 01:12:21
I've made a living in marketing/advertising for 15 years. I've also worked with other communities online. I sent ideas and never received a reply. They have missed so many chances to make money. Same thing with facebook. I've said since the IPO at facebook that they should contact twitter and require all those fucking celebrities to pay a fee based on a tier to reach out and contact that many fans. I mean if both twitter and facebook did it, they could make some nice money. It's not like they have somewhere else to go.

Rationally, the price isn't going to move unless the average fucking Joe can use it without it being a pain in the ass. And the average consumer isn't going to invest hoping the price rises. A lot of people tried that last fall and bought in at prices well higher then the price today. That's why we aren't seeing people invest in bitcoin. It doesn't help that every fucking time bitcoin is mentioned in the media, we hear shit about how it was $1100 and has dropped. 
So, like I said, if we want mainstream adoption and the price increases that comes with that, the garbage man down the street needs to be able to buy it and spend it without a hassle. This will never be invested in if people aren't buying and spending bitcoins. 
I'll keep my cold storage and keep increasing my stash. If you read my other post in this thread, I stated how I save 5-50% or more by using bitcoin. I then rebuy and add to my hot wallet. So, not only am I using it as a currency, i'm saving money and thus increasing my stake in bitcoin. I can easy take 2 bitcoin and double it with savings by buying shit I already buy anyway. 
I keep track of what I spend, how much I save and then use the savings to add more to my hot wallet for spending, some to cold storage and then use the rest to bring my family out for steak or a nice crawfish boil. 
While most bitcoin'ers sit around watching the price move daily, I am profiting from bitcoin daily. 
I'll gladly ride this train the way I am and not hope that one day my stash is worth something. It's all already 100% profit that I am using. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 20:43:53
I understand the reasons for holding. I have some in cold storage too. The thing is if bitcoin is ever going to get to the moon or whatever then the average Joe is going to have to WANT to use bitcoin. If all of us early adopters just sit on them, then why the fuck would companies ever think about accepting it? It has to be profitable. The only way to assist that is by actually supporting those that have chosen to accept it now. Otherwise, whats the fucking point? 
See that video of the guy that tried to live off of bitcoin for a day? The guy fucking struggled. Most of the places he tried to use it struggled to even fucking accept it. Do you think your neighbors/co workers are going to deal with that shit? I mean, in today's times people get upset when they see someone writing a check instead of swiping a card or paying cash. 
Now imagine standing in line at walmart or costco and some clown is trying to scan to make the payment and it's not quick or easy or fluid. How long do you think that shit will last? It won't and the only way we will make it smoother is by supporting it and letting the adoption process be improved on because it's profitable for someone to do it. 
Otherwise we will just be a bunch of nerds in 50 years giving our bitcoins to our heirs when we die and talking about how we fucked up.

[What happened sort of reminds me of this.]( Basically, the guy figured out that he could execute part of the contract and dump ether in his account. He did so, without really hacking anything, and now the ether community is upset because regardless of what action they choose, they are screwed. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:42:56
A guy executes part of the smart contract sending 3.6M + ether to his account. Eth leadership/community says it's theft/hacking when the guy did no such thing. The details of the contract were publicly available and ANYONE could have done it. Guy says if they do anything to destroy his 'legally' gotten ether, he will have his lawyer deal with it.

Uhm, been up trading for hours, woke up to alarms and digging into the news. But, here's the thing, the DAO is a smart contract investment thing. They coded in some rules so that all parties understand and agree to how things are going to work. Some guy found that he could split the DAO. This resulted in getting ETH. ETH is basically monopoly money for the DAO system. It's (ETH) not as available like btc, but it started off where you could only swap BTC for ETH. That's a little different now, but anyway. 
So, the guy got 3.6M ETH when they were say $20 per. But he had to know that it would be locked up for 27 days (I believe). ETH has since soft Forked, which means that his ETH will be locked and he can't use them. So the guy is threatening to sue or supposedly that's what this letter says, still haven't seen confirmation it was the guy/hacker. 
Thing is, the way this was done seems like an inside job or someone that knew he wouldn't be able to cash out the ETH into moolah, so my guess is that he set up a bunch of shorts with multiple accounts and executed the attack. That's really the only way he can profit from this. Just because of the way it's setup.

I must inform you that you are only saying it flatlined for 1/3 of its existence because of the price. Look at the VC investment into bitcoin now and then look at the money that went into the internet in the 90's. That's about the point bitcoin is at. [Bitcoin is on pace for a billion dollars worth of investment just from VC's this year.]( Anything that goes from 2 million in 2012 to 1 billion in 2015 has not flatlined. Sure the app that is currency has but the technology is pushing forward and eventually that will pay off for those that are paying attention. Even if the currency stats flatlined.

It's not that gay rights and abortion are not that important. Sure, they are. However, we have bigger issues to deal with. Our roads are basically falling apart. Education is falling behind the rest of the world and we are constantly cutting funding to that. It sort of pisses me off that we continue to give companies tax breaks and then hear those same companies complain about the lack of qualified applicants for jobs. Maybe if they paid there fair share of taxes, we could afford to increase spending to education. 
Not to mention debt. Student loan debt is crushing America. This has to be stopped. The entire system is falling apart and we are sitting here discussing gay rights and abortions? Who gives a fuck what other people do. Will any of that shit matter if things continue on this downward spiral? Nope, let's fix everything else then we can discuss those socials issues.

If you cannot afford the time to increase the amount of bitcoin you have then I would suggest buying a little here and there as you can afford it. Say like $5 or $10 worth as you can. 
Now if you had say $100, you could start trading the markets. There's nice little swings each way a few times a day that can make you 3-% per trade. If you don't have the time to babysit the market. Then look for deals. If you can find something that normally cost say $130 and the seller wants $100, well you just made $30 profit. I do trades like this all the time. A user posted about purse and other such sites up top. Use those to make yourself say 10% per trade. Even if you start with $20.

I looked at this job as a marketing guru, I for the life of me cannot figure out why someone with these skills would accept a job. Anyone that applies for that position is the wrong person for the company. I fail to understand how companies do not see this. If you have those skill sets, there are tons of ways to make money and to do it without a boss or for a company that is basically just offering you a part of the ESOP. 
I know I am ranting because I get approached all the time to take these types of jobs and a recent youtube video by Kevin O'leary shows that really rich people understand this. Kevin said, "I make the sales/marketing guy the highest paid in my companies and I take the ceiling off. I want the guy to make as much money as he can, because the more he makes, the more I make." 
This should be the thought process for any company. I have really noticed this trend in the bitcoin space. All these people with these ideas that they believe will change the world and they offer the guy that can make that happen crap. Anyways, I'll end this rant. My advice to anyone with any kind of start-up is find the right guy to be your VP of Sales/Marketing and make him an offer he cannot refuse.

One of the first things that got me excited about bitcoin was the idea that one day I could lease out a car. I wouldn't need to worry about meeting the customer or doing anything. Using the bitcoin technology and key cards, meaning that once payment was received the customers key card would operate the car or at least let the customer tell it where to go. They could take the car anywhere and I wouldn't have to be there. They could use an app or my website to rent out the car. Obviously this would be awesome with driverless cars.

If I was western union, I'd be seriously looking at bitcoin as a way to leverage my companies future. People are creatures of habit. [There's a reason why people still use banks instead of credit unions.]( So, if western union decided to sell/buy bitcoin and leveraged the fact that they are in a shitload of physical locations(which means a shitload of eyeballs). They could grab a huge market share and would retain that even after things were more mainstream.

I remember back in the 90's when people talked about the internet and how the govt was going to ruin it. The issue is the govt doesn't know how to ruin stuff that it doesn't understand. When you have the idiots we do in congress and stuff, we really have nothing to worry about. 
The only reason this may change this time is because back then certain industries ignored the internet because they didn't see it hurting their profits. This time, bitcoin is a direct attack against a large number of things, including: finance, banking, asset control and transfer, and even law. 
If they look back and see how the internet has harmed newspapers, tv, radio, etc..etc. They may wake up and do something about it, or try too.

I'm guessing coinbase knows that no one that's doing anything shady is going to come out and say, "yeah, I did this illegal thing..." 
So, they must be covering their ass by saying, "we asked the owner of that account, we were satisfied with the answers so we unlocked the account!" 
I still try to leave less then 1 btc in coinbase. I was naive a few years ago and used coinbase for things that still pay me. I'm to lazy to go around changing the wallet addys everywhere, so I just dump my balance from time to time to another wallet.

@_date: 2013-12-11 14:54:07
You have the right answer, but for the wrong reasons. For starters paypal isn't a currency, it's just a 3rd party that allows people to move money. Paypal's value is in fiat currencies. 
Bitcoin on the other hand was designed to replace fiat currency. The future of bitcoin is that one day we can buy/sell everything without ever needing fiat. Escrow services like paypal will allow buyer/seller protection and mediate disputes in transactions. 
TL,DR - Paypal relies on fiat currency, Bitcoin won't need to one day so they are apples and oranges.

I've already gotten 3 businesses to accept it. I am also talking to every business owner I know and seeing if they will accept it. 
It's an easy decision for most business owners once you explain to them that they CANNOT lose money because they get the sell price wired into their bank account. They don't have to hold bitcoin. No risk + more business + free PR = higher profits.

Reminds me of when I was in 9th grade. Our school system had just installed the computers for the first computer lit class. It was basic programming and really easy for someone that had computers dating back to the Atari 400's. I could 'code' in basic since I was about 8 or 9 years old. I actually learned by requesting the local library order me books on the language. 
Anyway, I would get bored in class and surf around in the directories. I found the log in file. Noticed one that said sys admin or something like that. I was a huge fan of the movie, 'War Games" so for shits and giggles I logged out of the computer with my login and attempted to log in with sys admin just guessing passwords like "school". Well my second guess was "pencil" and boom I was in. 
I started bragging as with this log in I could see and/or change any student's grades at any school in the district. For a couple days I played around looking up people's grades and stuff. 
Then one day my buddy was watching so after finishing and assignment, I logged in and brought up all his grades. In one door walks the Principal, in the other some other guy and they walk straight over to me. 
I knew I was toast. The bring me to the office and call my Dad. They want to suspend me and give me an F in the course (that I was easily Acing!) 
My father instructs them that they should thank me for finding this obvious flaw in the network. At this point they have me go sit in the lobby and my father has a little chat with them.
When they call me back in the office, I was to take the final the next day in the office and from that point forward I would be spending that hour in the gym with my football coach. Aced the final and was told to never touch a school board computer again. 
TL,DR - I cracked my school network because of the movie "War Games!"

IF someone invested in anything and didn't expect market swings they shouldn't be investing. Seems like it's been mentioned everywhere that a crash is coming, so this shouldn't be news to anyone.

Not even close to being true. 
Ponzi schemes are investment based with newer investments paying out older investments. There is no product involved in Ponzis. 
MLM - Product based and the product has to have a real world value. Like I can't sell you $5 hosting for $200 a month to give out kick ass commissions. 
I would be very wary of any MLM accepting bitcoin right now. Most of those will be illegal that will get shutdown. Amway has fought and won cases proving that they are legit. 
Like 95% of so called mlm's are illegal.

They didn't catch me because I spoke about it. They caught me because someone noticed the log ins on that account from the computer I was on and thought it was strange. Apparently they called and asked if that was the teachers off hour. It wasn't so the guy came from the central office the next day and when I logged on they entered the classroom. 
They knew it was me because I would typically log out from my log in and then log in on that one. So by tracking the log ins, they knew it was me. Plus the teachers didn't have access to that account.

* click 'give gold'
* Select bitcoin
* New window opens showing the purchase (reddit gold for $3.99) Click to pay
* Little window opens to confirm payment from my coinbase wallet
Done. 
So, It was 4 clicks. Never had to typed anything. Really easy to use. Basically one has a choice, you can use a service like coinbase and it's really easy. Otherwise, you have to download a wallet, sync with the network, then the transaction would look like this: 
* Click give gold
* Click on bitcoin
* Copy address to send payment too
* Open wallet, paste address, enter amount to be sent, click send. 
Once the transaction hits the gold will be credited. Either way, it's really not difficult.

I remember back in 2010 refusing to accept a rather large payment via BTC. 
In my defense, I had been burned by processors such as egold, liberty reserve, intgold and some others. I preferred to get paid via bank wire. It didn't help that the guy telling me about bitcoin told me it was just a processor like LR without a head quarters. I wasn't told the great things about it, so I refused.

I noticed a while back that for some reason bofa was charging me a monthly fee. When I called about it they said it's because I linked my savings account for over draft protection. I never agreed to this for several reasons and haven't ever come close to over drafting. They agreed to remove the fees going back 6 months. I was shocked? 6 months? You've been taking this money for over 2 years. We are only allowed to go back 6 months. Gee thanks. 
Then I asked about the atm fees. Considering BofA doesn't have a bank/atm in my home state. (The reason I use bofa is another story..) They agreed to wave atm fees that happen in La going back 6 months. Okay, cool... Will this fee be waived going forward? Yes, says the girl. So every 3 months I call and have them remove the fees because it's not automatic. And god forbid I let it go 6 months. God knows they can't open their books past that magical 180 day threshold. 
TL,DR - Fuck banks.

Hey In the past month or so I've been taking a look at bitcoin since I originally invested in it a year ago or so. I made some money with it and felt it wouldn't move for a while so I took my profits and moved on. Recently, I've been talking to my investor friends/associates about diving in again at some point. My renewed interest was due to some guys on facebook talking about it(really smart guys), the user here on reddit who borrowed 30k and dumped it all in bitcoin and my love of making money passively. 
Here is the response from a very smart man, he makes a living off the stock market, and I would love a well thought out reply to this from those who understand this better than I do. 


I know the code is open source and available and the system can't be cheated by hackers because all transactions have that checks and balances system of having to be verified across the board, etc..etc. 
Could you or another use please fill in the blanks here? I can have some influence with very wealthy individuals, I just need to have all my facts lined up. 
Thanks!

This is okay for bitcoin. I think he get's it, but bitcoin can be used as a currency right now. Using bitpay anyone selling something is at no risk of the market fluctuations. I sell something for $50 in btc and later that night I get $50 in fiat currency from bitpay minus a small fee. Those fees aren't higher than paypals or merchant account fees. 
TL,DR - BTC is a no brainer for businesses. No risk of losing money and a ton of free PR because you adapted to it early. Jump on this bandwagon people/companies.

Most people that have asked me about bitcoin seem over-whelmed at first with what exactly bitcoin is or does. Yet, something like dogecoin is cheap to get involved with (tips flying around all the time) and the community is helpful in whenever someone ask a question. Unlike here in the bitcoin circlejerk. 
Regardless of the price I think dogecoin serves a purpose and will only help bitcoin.

Bitcoin, litecoin, namecoin, and now megacoin. I wish they had a wallet that handle all of these. Any advice on that?

I've been getting my porn for free since 1996. Not sure one can ever run out of free porn.

So the attacker had physical access to your phone? Tell us how you got your phone back. Why don't you lock your phone? 3 layers of defense seems better than 2. Am I missing something? How is this totally coinbases fault? Unless I am missing something it sounds like you are blaming the safe because you left the safe open, unattended with 20k in it. 
Sucks that someone stole it... If I am wrong I'm sorry. Just trying to wrap my head around how you lost these btc.
