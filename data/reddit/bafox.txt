I've been eagerly waiting for someone to figure out a bitcoin paywall, but I have a few reservations about bitwall. 
Check out the basic application with their blog: 
To see any blog post, you have to either tweet or watch an ad. Whenever they get bitcoin implemented, I suppose you'll be able to pay as well. 
But you have to do something for *each* article in the blog. I'm not going to tweet about bitwall five times to read their five short blog posts. And sitting through a fifteen second ad wall (albeit adblocked) for each article is equally cumbersome. 
Maybe if there is a site-wide pass option? That seems more viable with bitcoin, but not as much with the tweets and ads. 
My biggest concern is how they are addressing the miner fee. If they're partnering with coinbase, that might conceivably bypass the issue. But I haven't seen any info. on how they plan to facilitate $.01 transactions. On top of that, what kind of fees they may be charging. 
In any event, I hope that they can make this work.

Agreed, simpler is best. Often though people start asking questions which lead to a rabbit hole. In any event, I'll post a new merchant announcement if and when he ever starts accepting. Thanks for the suggestions.

A big barrier is understanding- for instance, it's confusing to see a string of thirty letters and numbers and associate that as your "wallet," and then to explain that you shouldn't keep lots of bitcoins on an online wallet but instead on a "paper" wallet. And then to explain paper wallets and the mechanics behind that- at some point, for many non-tech people, they just shut down when things get too complex. 
Coinbase is one of the easiest ways to integrate I've seen yet. I forwarded him that today. Apart from that, I think it's a mental challenge to create a wallet, find an html bitcoin button, link that wallet to that button etc. 
More than anything I really think many small businesses just lack an appreciation that there is a large group of people who actually use bitcoin and would be willing to use it for their business. There's no real impetus to adopt if there's no one using it- you know?

I'm an attorney too. I'd have to see what kind of advice they're giving I suppose before passing judgment, but I don't think this site will pass muster with the ABA and most state bar associations when/if they get wind of it. The unauthorized practice of law is going to be the big issue here.

Right- this seems like a useful feature. My question is why no one ever talks about it in terms of the problem/solution?
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:01:53
You're referring to the effects of the solution rather than the solution itself. It seems like an intrinsically useful feature, but I guess it's not useful as a talking point.

[I made another post because I thought this was deleted, this is from that] 
I encounter this problem a lot when I meet people who run their own business- they like Bitcoin conceptually after I explain it, but almost no one follows through with adopting it. I feel like the barrier to entry is deterring. And I think a lot of these businesses don't think people actually use bitcoin...
Tl;dr any thoughts on how to effectively present bitcoin so a small business will adopt it?

It's really whatever the traveler thinks their stay was worth. But the hostel suggested donations for one's night stay, I think, is $20.

I think it would be perfect- it's a donation based hostel, and everything about it lines up with what Bitcoin is about. All he has on the site now is PayPal and it drives me crazy. Yes, I'd like to promote my friend's hostel to the bitcoin community, but more than anything I just really want to see bitcoin spread to places like this.

How do you plan on dealing with malpractice claims, let alone unauthorized practice of law allegations?
