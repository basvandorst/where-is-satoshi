If the price of BTC doubles, you willl have the exact same amount of BTC as you had before.

So, basically what you're saying is: hodl enough bitcoin, become a dragon?
Wait till my mom hears about this, i can finally show her you CAN be whatever you want! Pfft, "You're human, get a normal job!", yeah right!
I have so many questions, but i'll start with just a few: how much btc do i need to hodl (and for how long) to turn into one? Also, does amount attribute to dragon size? Any particulars i should know before going all in?

Why does ver call bitcoin bitcoin core? I like to think it's their way of giving him the finger :-x.

Yeah, the guy in the red shirt doesn't understand bitcoin at all..
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:35:35
It's probably more money in a "single" point of possible failure than you would have on your wallet, making it a juicier target for hackers/thieves, do you really need more reason than that?
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:55:37
Good for you! People who shout bitcoin will drop to 0 do not really understand it, imo. It might fluctuate up and down for a while but will almost certainly be worth more in the long term :) Just store your private keys somewhere you never look and check back in a few years, i wished i had done this rather than sell at 2-3x profits over the years :P

Hence the qoutemarks ("") around single: because i have no insight in their precise security measures whatsoever. What i mean is that coinbase itself is a single entity, and with the amount of money they handle they will pretty much always be a juicier (single) target than any (single) individual and their meagre assets. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:23:22
Right? xD Personally, I find it TERRIFYING that they are so blatant and their lies so obvious, yet they seem to still be sticking around.. Never thought BCH would live past the last crash.

Not exactly, it's like saying ft knox is LESS secure (huuuggeee difference) because everyone knows where the gold is, if they were able to hide the location, it would be safer for it. My logic seems sound to me :P. All the security measures in the world still don't make something 100% secure. Most of those measures are there because they're needed, because they are prone to be attacked. You're basically saying the tank that's taking all the bulletfire is the safest place on the battlefield because it has so much plating :P
Ft. Knox is not some sort of magical entity that has been there since the beginning of time. It can and most likely will fall and/or fade at some point in time, as everything will. Who knows how long anything will last. Let alone something stuck in a single location in what i would call an unstable 'murica (considering who's in charge atm :P), on an ever more unstable planet earth or just us as a species, anyways, best get back on topic:
Physical vs digital security is hardly comparable, just too many dissimilarities. If i did somehow manage to break into and steal all the gold from ft knox, i'd still need a buttload of trucks just to carry it all out. As for private keys however, i can basically carry an infinite amount of them on my person at all times, or just send them somewhere in a near instant.. As for hacking: everything digital ever created has still been created by humans, directly or indirectly, and therefore can technically be hacked (however difficult and improbable). Therefore i believe: the juicier the target, the more likely chance of attacks and therefore the most chance of having your stuff stolen. 
Could possibly be wrong about this, but then again, what do i know, i'm just an "evolved" ape bound to a single perspective in this vast universe we call reality.
From your link:
"Drives and paper backups are distributed geographically in safe deposit boxes and vaults around the world." I read that as: there are multiple points of failure. Physical locations where their keys are stored, probably multiple individuals with access to those at some level. Which to me sounds a lot riskier than you having a single private key on a piece of paper hidden in your closet where nobody ever even looks (in case you're wondering: i didn't store mine there, mr burglar :P), if only against the case of theft.
Maybe if coinbase had the same security measures ft knox has i'd feel safer leaving a large portion (read: not all) of my money on there. Since i don't ever see that happening, i'll choose to write down my own private keys and store them somewhere only i know about.

This, gold's intrinsic value doesn't hold a candle to it current market value. It's a mostly useless metal with better alternatives for almost all of its use cases, the reason it has so much value is because it is used as a medium of exchange/store of value/faith that you can sell it for more in the future. Not because you can make pwetty things out of it.

If that ~48% does invest in crypto i think we'd all be very happy though ;)! Do you happen to know if that number changed over the recent years or has it stagnated around 50%? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:53:20
If you're very hungry today, there is plenty of incentive to spend your currency today. If you break your phone, ditto. If you want to buy an extra pair of shoes, you might actually wait a while rather than spend your money because it could be worth more tomorrow. Deflationary seems to promote more healthy spending to me

I'm a bit lost on your math here. What is **"18 million BTC already mined, 85% of 21 million ever to exist"**, as in: what does word,word mean, mathematically? The rest kinda makes sense. You're basically saying x,y + a + b + c = ????, so sup with the x,y?

Storing a giant list of stores accepting btc seems to me like a horrible way of keeping track. Once you have 50+ it basically becomes unreadable. Either a map for the physical stores and/or a sortable database make most sense if you ask me. Especially the sorting part
