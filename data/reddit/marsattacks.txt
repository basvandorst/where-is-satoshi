The problem is that a hacker can swipe a wallet in one go. There should be a feature where you can set the maximum drain rate of a wallet, combined with a emergency stop address; if that other wallet contains any funds, no coins can be moved out.

The value of any stocks we own is also taxed by that amount. The tax was introduced under the guise of simplifying the capital gains tax. They assumed everyone can yield at least 4% profit on their savings or investments, and that part is taxed 30%. But you're right, the only way to get 4% nowadays is to buy stocks.

In the Netherlands they've been taxing wealth for 10+ years now.
