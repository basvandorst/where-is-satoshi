You can also send issues to project maintainers, but obviously if you're not paying anything, they may not be inclined to help. Hence why people pay for Red Hat instead of using CentOS, for example. 
Reversing fraudulent transactions has nothing to do with open/closed source. And neither does something being a working product.

Pretty sure the wtf is about bringing Mexicans into this. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:19:15
It just comes off as racist since you're saying an entire group of people makes very little money. There's plenty of successful Mexican people. 
If you wanted to be more accurate and less racist, you could have said "even people working in sweat shops make more" or "you can make more money in just about any other way." 
Now I think I'm getting dangerously close to tone policing, but I think the point still stands. You didn't have to generalize an entire race to make your point.

What you might be referring to is whether or not your public key (not the string starting with 1, but the very large integer of which the string starting with 1 is the hash) is in the blockchain. You can receive as many payments at an address as you like and you will remain just as safe as if you never did anything with your addresses. However, once you send money from your addresses, you have to sign the transaction, which shows the world your public key forever. Usually not a big deal, but if your addresses were generated insecurely, people may be able to crack the private key and take your money.

* Time isn't measured in seconds (difficulty recalculated every 2 weeks, which is about 2016 blocks), time **is** measured in blocks (difficulty recalculated every 2016 blocks, which is about 2 weeks).
* The network stays very in sync. Miners want to be in sync with the majority of the network. Say 90% of the network has heard of the 2016th block since the last difficulty change. 90% of the network is now at a different diff. A miner in the last 10% is working on a block that's already been solved and is essentially wasting his time because if he happens to find a block even a couple seconds after 90% of the network has agreed on a different one, his will be rejected. The fact that his is likely at a diff. lower than the 90%'s diff doesn't even come into play in this scenario.

Though I may disagree with the gov't on what a taxable event should be, I agree that converting bitcoin &lt;--&gt; altcoin should be one. It is way different that going from 1x $100 bill to 10x $10 bills because each cryptocurrency undergoes their own separate price fluctuations while the different bills do not. Therefore you can experience a gain in assests by playing your cards right.

Off topic correction: drives are measured in bytes too. It is just different calculations that go into determining the size.

It is advantageous to miners to always be up-to-date with the longest (and what they think is valid based on what software they are running) chain to date. Therefore they are constantly checking for new blocks on the network. If they find a new block, they are going to stop what they are doing on building on top of the previous block because anything they find will be rejected. 
Now, if there's a bug found or a weird transaction that different versions of the software treat differently, we may see a fork where different miners are on different chains. This has happened in the past, I think the last time was around the time 0.8.x came out. 
Sometimes two different miners find a block at the same time, and it just comes down to whichever block is propagated faster. If it is about 50/50, the next block will decide the "winner." Basically, big long discrepancies don't happen very often.
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:11:47

I think most people are thinking this: "well... I'm still not technically losing money, so I might as well continue even if it's just pennies a day." Or if they aren't keeping track of electricity use, they may be in the red, not care, and just desperately continue to mine. 
For me, I got free electricity and a free GPU. So I continue to hash away. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:27:42
You're not looking at the right ones. There are many different methods of payment, some more expensive than others. Reasons include fees and risk for the seller. Don't badmouth localbitcoins as a whole just because you're only looking at paypal/moneypak (some of the most expensive methods, IIRC).

Okay so he could opt to not pay a fee. However, most wallets will stop you if they predict the transaction will fail to confirm in a reasonable amount of time.

It really can be a satoshi as long as every relevant party (the dealership, the owner, law enforcement, the second owner, third owner, etc.) agrees that the owner of the car would have that colored coin, similar to the owner of the car having the title. The same thing can be done with a company releasing 10,000 shares, each represented by 1 satoshi, but the colored satoshi was bought for $100 and represents roughly $10 in dividends every 6 months or something.

For larger block size:
* handle more transactions as current limit is too low
* the network can handle the extra bandwidth
* storage is cheap
* most nodes can transition to a type that doesn't have to store the entire chain
Against larger block size:
* current limit is fine, we should just use off-chain transactions for most things in the future
* network can't and shouldn't have to handle the extra bandwidth
* it is hard enough to convince someone to store the entire blockchain as it is today
* that leads to having only a handful of nodes that have the entire history of the blockchain and that's bad.

They have a database with your credit card number(s) in it and they could get hacked. 
With bitcoin, it doesn't matter because the sender always has to initiate the transaction.

The perfect future for bitcoin (in my head): the value of btc rises slowly and steadily over time. Slow enough that it doesn't hurt to buy now instead of later (similar to how inflation in the US is arguably slow enough to not hurt saving for later), but also significant enough that the average person can save some from every paycheck and with little risk, be able to almost entirely retire on it. I don't think people will stop buying things that they need just because for 1 BTC today they get 100 hamburgers and 1 BTC in 5 years they get 125. I also think that people will continue to buy "luxury" things such as TVs and cars, but will possibly look more for which is best built.

Until we get smart tx fee logic in wallets, you kind of have to get a feel for these things right now. For example, I've regularly been moving &gt; 1 BTC at a time for a few weeks now without a fee. Only once did it take a few hours to get a confirmation. 
What you have to keep in the back of your mind are a few things.
* How many inputs will there be in this tx. The more there are, the larger the tx will be in bytes and thus the more likely you'll need a fee. Even if all the money is in one address, you could still have hundreds of really small inputs. For example: gambling with satoshi dice.
* How much money are you moving. The more btc, the more likely miners will see your tx as "important" and less likely you'll need a fee
* How many outputs will there be in the tx. Similar reasoning as inputs. Usually there will be one or two outputs so not as big of a deal.
All in all, it is a educated guessing game. If you're not in a hurry, you may get away with no fee. But if there's any reason you can't wait 10+ hours for a tx to confirm, you should pay a 0.0001 or 0.0002 fee. .0001 is the "standard" fee right now.

If you are being serious, then here.
* There's no single program you have to use in order to own bitcoin.
* The creator of bitcoin can't shut it down, because the network is decentralized and there's nothing **to** shut down. 
* It is very unlikely/impossible that anyone could steal all the bitcoins as the code is open source and lots and lots of people have had the chance to look for coin-stealing code. In addition, if someone stole all the coins, they'd be worthless as no one would want them anymore.
* It can't happen. Relax and research.

No. It depends on the amount he has and how much risk he's willing to take. $5 for most people is nothing and they shouldn't be killing their first born for an extra handful of bits of entrophy on a 101 step process that involves building a compiler from scratch in order to build a custom OS from scratch on a PC you designed parts for and that will be buried after use.

Updates that will cause forks are announced well in advance with a release date giving people plenty of time to change over. Most updates do not cause a fork. Of course some may stay back if they have a political reason or whatever. But most people will move forward if they think the majority will too. 
Sometimes, an update introduces a bug or an incompatibility between it and previous versions. The issue isn't found out until later. The last time this happened was (I think) 0.7.x --&gt; 0.8.x. The network spilt into a nodes-running-0.8.x chain and nodes-running-everything-else chain. Luckily the right people were awake at the time and mining pools switched to the "everything-else" chain to make it longer and "correct" in all nodes' eyes.

[Please see this relevant stackexchange post]( I will quote the top answer here.
The Bitcoin client has a number of sources that it uses to locate the network on initial startup. In order of importance:
1) The primary mechanism, if the client has ever run on this machine before and its database is intact, is to look at its database. It tracks every node it has seen on the network, how long ago it last saw it, and its IP address.
2) The client can use DNS to locate a list of nodes connected to the network. One such seed is bitseed.xf2.org. The client will resolve this and get a list of Bitcoin nodes.
3) The client has a list of semi-permanent nodes compiled into it.
4) The client can connect to a well-known IRC network, irc.lfnet.org, and find other nodes that way. (This method has been removed as of version 0.8.2)

Assuming USA:
Yes. Anytime you buy/get bitcoins, you need to record the basis that you got them at so you know how much the cost you (or how much they were worth). Anytime you sell/get rid of bitcoins--even if for something not USD--you are realizing capital gains or losses and they should be reported. You have to report all capital gains/losses on your taxes each year.

It is technically possible. That doesn't mean it will happen. You underestimate the size of the key space. As long as everyone is using good sources for entropy, it isn't going to happen. If two people somehow manage to use the same poor source of entropy, then *maybe*. Time frame depends on how shoddy their RNG is. 
Think of it this way if it helps. It was going to take my single consumer grade GPU like 2 days to find an address with a base-38 encoded public key I wanted to start with a certain 6 characters. Each additional character exponentially makes it more difficult. So 7 characters could be 20 days. 8 chars - 200 days. Bitcoin base-38 public addresses are 34-37 characters long (or about that if I'm off a little bit). Generating an arbitrary address by chance isn't going to happen.

People who want to make a tx pay the tx fee. 
Depending on the wallet you use, you may be able to pay whatever you want; however, most make a heavy recommendation on what it should be at a minimum and may even prevent you from paying less. Most miners use the same formula, so it works out that the "standard" fee is 0.0001 (or it might be 0.00001 if most miners are using the latest bitcoin-core). Anyway, the forumla looks something like this (**heavily** simplified, and could be wrong as this is stretching my knowledge).
`sizeOfTxIn_kB` * 0.0001 - (`constant` * `coinAge`) +/- `other stuff maybe`
Basically, if you don't pay enough for a large (in kB, not btc) tx, then it may not be accepted. You can more easily send "old" coins without a fee. There may be other factors too.
The idea is, in fact, that as bitcoin grows in popularity and the network sees more and more txs, the fee will hopefully float *down*. The reasoning is simply that more people paying lower fees = the same total tx fees as before or more. So while a 0.0001 tx fee seems small today, in 10 years it may be massive and the normal be 10 satoshi or something.
And your final 51% attack question. Ceteris paribus, if the total block reward (new coins + tx fees) gets too small to not be profitable to mine, some people will stop mining. Then it will be less difficult to make a profit and the remaining miners will see a little profit again. The network *should* work itself out if there's an imbalance. If the network hashrate goes down, then yes, it is a fact that it is easier to control 51% of the network. Whether or not this becomes a problem, we'll see. We should have smarter wallets that are better at calculating fees by then.

This is the important thing. The news/average person will be all over it calling it a scheme to make bitcoin look cheaper so the price will go up. It is exactly like a stock split. There would be so much bad press from giving 1 bitcoin a new meaning. I agree with the second panel: make bits colloquial for 100 satoshi and leave bitcoin alone. If people talk in bits instead, it will have the same affect as changing what 1 bitcoin means, albeit with "yet another" unit to remember.

*My* point is that just by buying a pi and installing the 21 software you do not get a comparable device. It needs to mine as well--regardless of how well it mines. And you have (Cost of entire 21 device) - (Total cost of pi, sd card, etc.) dollars to make the pi mine at a comparable rate. If to do so the cost gets close to the pre-made device, you should start considering just buying the pre-made device.
Also, I acknowledge that the ASIC you get isn't a good investment. The point of the device isn't to mine more than it costs. If that was the point, it wouldn't come with a full node and there development API.

Depends on the wallet. If it will allow you to send from specific addresses and spend unconfirmed funds, then you should be able to do what I described. 
Essentially, the second transaction will force the first to confirm, since miners will want to include the second one but can't without the first.
@_date: 2015-11-04 00:30:57
If you got change, you can try spending it in a transaction with a fee to force the first one to go through. Your client has to allow spending of unconfirmed funds, and you obviously need to have gotten change out of that transaction.
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:22:33
* Determine the address that the change is in. I'm guessing it is 1Dw4jgbMQEg7KFCU4uQgqSVVtqjW91bW3Q
* On the addresses tab, right click on the address your change is in and click send from
* Send yourself money. Select an address from your wallet and copy/paste it into the pay to box
* Select an amount and a fee and then send. A fee of 0.0001 BTC should be plenty (about 4 cents).

I think it makes sense. Just keep track of inputs/outputs and calculate balance from there. Maybe it is weird to not be able to spend half an input without generating a new one, but if you ask for change for a $10, you are essentially spending $10 and getting back $10 in smaller forms. Plus there's no easy way to mark an input as half-spent or 1/4-spent, etc., and the blockchain needs to know which inputs were used in each transaction and not just a guess.

It is created on your local machine. In fact, 100 of them are created and a bank of 100 addresses is always maintained, even if they aren't shown to you. People can look at the code and verify that the private keys aren't being sent somewhere after generation. Also note that there's no reason for the client to check that they are unique by sending them to the network as the keyspace is so large (2^160) that it is very safe to assume they are unique.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:42:59
Currently there's a 1 MB blocksize limit, which equates to about 7 transactions a second. So with 6 blocks an hour, 24 hours a day, we could see the blockchain size increase by 144 MB/day worst case scenario. That's 52 GB a year. No big deal.

Difficulty vs. total network hashrate. Diff is adjusted every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks) to match the usually growing hashrate. It adjusts such that each block should take about 10 mns to find. In reality, when getting closer to that 2016th block, blocks are currently being found closer to 5-7 mns.

* by how fast miners are hashing away. Every 2016 blocks (~2 weeks) the difficulty recalculates such that a possibly changing aggregate network hashrate still finds a new block every 10 minutes on average.
* No such thing as "a bitcoin." They exist as balances in and out of an address recorded in the public ledger--the blockchain. Your client looks at the blockchain and subtracts all money out of an address from all money into an address to get its balance. A private key is the secret part of the public key (private: 5xxxxxxxxxx, public: 1xxxxxxxxxxx). You usually never see it. It is what is needed for your wallet to create a transaction and spend money from an address. You only need a public key to receive money. You have to have the private one to spend it.
* I think I answered this. A wallet is a collection of private keys
* miners. Depending on the client, you can choose what tx fee you want to use, if one at all. Just know that setting the fee too low or zero could mean miners never include your transaction since they don't have any incentive too.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:37:01
I'm guessing 0% or very close to 0% interest rates. Because you're right: it hurts more to borrow 100 BTC @ $1000 and have to pay back 110 BTC @ $1100 than it would if the purchasing power dropped over the time of the loan like it would with USD. With (close to) 0% interest, you get coins now and only have to pay the same number of coins back, regardless of value in the future.
Who really knows though. It is so different that what we currently have.

Idk how likely it is. But look at the front page of right now. Inputs.io has been haked and accounts being drained. It is never a good idea to keep money in a online account for very long--especially if you do not have control of your private keys.
Private keys are the passwords that allow you to spend the coins associated with them. So if you have access to your private keys, yes you can export them and import them into a different service like blockchain.info's wallet. Most exchanges do not let you control your private keys. In fact, most of them don't even have dedicated addresses for you! Just like a bank. So there would be no private keys for you to even export and backup in case of failure.

They can be destoryed in a sense. [for example]( This address is readable in english. It is very very very very very unlikely that anyone has the private key for this address. So any coins sent here are understood to be lost forever. 
They can also be considered destroyed when you ~~loose~~ lose the private key to an address that has coins in it. Same scenario: no one has the private key, so no one can spend them. Only difference is the public key isn't funny.

Cold wallet: not necessary for most people unless storing vast amounts of wealth. If they are, then they should be doing research anyway.

Armory is very nice. Windows is probably worst OS of choice just because 99% of viruses are written for it and the theory that microsoft has backdoors in Windows for the NSA and such. So ... inb4 "Linux is so much better" or "OS X is safer and can't get viruses," those sentiments do have some truth, but if you're not dealing with a ton of money or you're not worried about NSA and crap, you're probably fine.

That is a harder question. Right now I'm pretty sure most software takes the lazy way and just sets 0.0005 BTC as the standard. I'm pretty sure the next version of bitcoin-qt will do some math to calculate it. 
I can't give you the exact math, but it is based on a flat starting fee, adds in extra money if the transaction is large (in bytes, not bitcoins), and adds in extra money if the coins are young (you are spending inputs you got not too long ago).

1) in order for you to get a copy of the webpage on your computer, it has to have touched the internet before. Or, at the very least, a flashdrive that has been in a computer with internet before. This, I feel, is nit-picking. I don't even usually feel parinoid enough to go offline while using bitaddress.org. But it is still a nice feeling when you chip away all the possible insecurities. Espeically when storing large sums of money.
2) point three still stands as far as the printer storing an image of everything you print. Again, I can't name a printer that does this, as I have done zero research on it.
3) This is true. The manufacturer states the paper Piper uses will last 10 years in optimal conditions. If you think you are in less-than-optimal conditions, then check them more often or use a form of digital (possibly multiple layers of redundant digital) backup.
4) The code wrote for Piper is on github (found the link) [here]( If you do not trust that built your Piper with the same code, you can build it yourself after receiving it.
5) I haven't used any other than bitaddress. Do they allow you to insert your own logo? If so, Piper would still allow you to completely redesign the wallet, while I imagine most websites wouldn't.
All in all, I bought a Piper for the convenience. It feels safer or just as safe as alternatives. It is a small package that does it all on its own, completely offline, without the need for a monitor/keyboard/anything.
^(If nothing else, I helped out a fellow [aspiring?] dev, and picked up an R Pi in the process.)

Yes the value will theoretically increase to match the slowly shrinking money supply. The entire bitcoin economy would work just fine with 1 BTC. Or even 0.01 BTC. Whatever.
It is true that right now they are not infinitely divisible, but it would not be too hard to just double the number of decimal places. I'm not sure if the fork required would be hard or soft, but it **is** possible.

Yes a paper wallet would be a great option. Be sure to check on it every year or so to make sure it is still readable. 
Yes you can expect it to be compatible with future programs. The only thing you might want to watch out for is a hard fork where old coins become useless unless you send them to a new address version (say, for example, bitcoin changes from SHA-256 to SHA-512 b/c 256 has been found insecure). More than likely you'd have a big window to make the conversion.

If they are from a bunch of different addresses, then whatever wallet software the tx originated from was just adding addresses it had to the transaction until it had enough to meet the amount needed to send.

No, the first address in it was generated and given to you by the bot. **Wallets != addresses.** You can make as many addresses as you want in it.
If you're worried about the bot knowing your password and having access to all the addresses you make, that's a valid concern. Either change your password and/or enable 2FA, or just make a different blockchain.info account and do these things in that one.

All public keys contain a checksum on the end. For example: 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE. The "f59kuE" is the checksum of the first part of the address. Wallets check to make sure the checksum is the product of the first part and then consider it valid. That is all the creator of this address did: Calculate the check some of something funny that was the right length and combine the two. No private key required.

Possibly. Ideally, miners would see that they are no longer making a profit and will stop mining. That will cause the difficulty to go down. Eventually those still mining will be making a profit. So more miners will join driving the difficulty up. Rinse and repeat.

Reading over your 2nd scenario in your OP though ...


I'm not *positive* about this. So take the following with a grain of salt. 
I don't think blockchain stores IP addresses or anything. Judging by how often my browser asks if it is okay to store info locally for blockchain.info, **I'm guessing that once you've gone alias --&gt; identifier in an email for yourself, if you allow your browser to do so, blockchain.info stores the conversion on your computer. I don't think it has anything to do with IP.** I think it's included in the email so you can quickly know if that was you or not. Hence why the link is always the same.

Others are welcome to provide you with their insight, but here's what I said before.
I don't think miners will hard fork into a version of bitcoin that doesn't have a cap on the number of coins available because doing so would remove one of the defining features of bitcoin. Maybe some will try. Who knows. But they would probably 1) cause a huge sell off as people see their coins as no longer being what they used to be, and 2) would be creating inflation, thus further lowering the value of their coins.

(Idk if *literally* every other mainstream currency is inflationary, but it is close to literally I think)
I'm not great with the economics behind bitcoin, to be honest. But I *do* know I like the idea of a currency that cannot have the value manipulated by a central authority, which is what we have in most countries today. And because they need to print off money to pay off debt, they make it inflationary. Which of course lowers the value of the currency, etc. etc. Debt is an interesting issue in a deflationary system in and of itself.

The next "problem" is always finding a hash that bundles the following together. 1. the hash of the previous block, 2. the hashes of a bunch of pending transactions, 3. a nounce (just a quick way to change the value over and over to try again). Miners are hashing all those things together into one hash as fast as they can and the first one (or first team) to get a hash above the current difficulty "wins" the block reward and all the transaction fees. They then want to propagate that block to the rest of the network so no one else that might've accomplished the same thing as them gets more propagation first. 


Kind of. If you have a significant amount of hashing power compared to the rest of the network, you can try to mine two blocks all by yourself and *then* show them to the network and hope they catch on. This is very hard to do because you have to follow all those rules in the first answer for the first block, then do it all over again with the second block (only this time refrencing the first one you found instead of what the network thinks is the most recent one). 


I'm not good with the nitty-gritty with what happens in the code, but here's what happens in common terms. You have an address, 1abcdef (and private key 5asdfjkl), that you want to prove to me that you own. What you can have your client do is sign a message with 1abcdef's **private key** stating that 1abcdef belongs to Since you are probably the only one that has access to 1abcdef's private key, it can resonably be assumed that you are the man/woman owning that address and all the bitcoins in it.


1 confirmation = 1 block. That means a miner somewhere has included your tx in a block following the rules in answer 1. Yay for you! 2 confirmation = 2 blocks, or that there is now *yet another* block on top of the one your transaction is in. Remember how hard it is to mine more than one block on your own in the time it takes the network to do one? Well that is why ~6 confirmations is considered 99.9999% safe. In realitely, it depends on the amount of money changing hands and how much you trust the other party to set things right if something screwy happens with the block your tx is in.


So you have a client, such as armory, on a computer not connected to a computer. You go to that wallet that contains address 1abcdef that you want to spend some coins from to buy something. Only problem is, there's no way your client can tell the network you're sending money! Oh no! So what you do instead is ask the client to generate the transaction in a process very similar to signing a message (b/c it involves 1abcdef's private key). You then would take the transaction hash it gives you and move to an online computer in order to broadcast it. Yipee! Now you've sent money without 1abcdef's private key ever being near the big scary internet. 
sorry if I sounded condescending at the end or something. I'm just a little tired and wanting to have fun, not be mean.

It is really hard. For small amounts ("small" is defined by you), no confirmations is probably okay, but still can be risky if the block it is included in is orphaned. 1 confirmation for medium-small. 3 for medium, etc. Depends on how long you can wake and how worried you are.

Be very careful using coinbase as your wallet in any fashion. They've recently taken up auto-refunding incoming money that doesn't seem to be going to/coming from the right place.
What I would do is make a wallet at  and make a paper backup of it. Similar to what you're asking I think, only you should be in total control of your keys. 
Also keep in mind, yea it might be nice to fund your wallet from anywhere you have the paper, but a paper backup of an online is not protecting your coins. Your computer could still be compromised and all the money on the paper wallet removed. Paper wallets get the most utility when used as a savings account of sorts. You put money in and don't take it out. And when you do take it out, you take it all out and send the remaining balance to a new paper wallet. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:15:24


Because the addresses are stored in the wallet file? You don't start with an infinite number of addresses. You start with 1, or 10 or something manageable (usually hidden in the background). Armory and some other wallets generate new addresses deterministically (based on the seed you backed up). So when you need more addresses in your wallet file, it just makes more. Since they are generated in a deterministic way, you can do it again and again every time your computer crashes. 
Hopefully that clears things up. I didn't answer all your questions, but hopefully you know the answers now. Let me know if not.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:00:37
It is possible to do this sort of study simply by studying the blockchain (at least for pools that make the coinbase transaction go to the users directly). You can see when coins move from the initial address(es), but not necessarily when they are sold.
Just find transactions [such as this one]( and watch the outputs.

It goes to a wallet on their site that they have control of (sounds bad, but they **seem** trustworthy. Lots of money has been through their hands, especially mine!). Anyway, after you bought them on coinbase, you could send them to yourself in your desktop wallet, you could send them to me, you could send them to your wallet on Mt. Gox, you can do whatever you want. They always exist at a bitcoin address, no matter what party has control of that address's private keys. 
In case you're confused/concerned about me continuing to say that they have control of your private keys, do not be immediately alarmed. You can freely send money to/from your coinbase wallet. The issue, though, is that you can't back up your keys so that if coinbase burns down, you can still have your money that could be tied up in your coinbase wallet. Same is true for mtgox. One nice web wallet (but no way to buy bitcoins through them) is blockchain.info. **They** do not (claim) to have any access to your keys what so ever. If their site goes down, you should've had automatic email backups already set up so you can import your keys to any desktop client you want.

Miners mine through an instance of bitcoind (like bitcoin-qt), or if in a pool environment, I'm pretty sure the operator is running something bitcoind-esk. 
Clients and miners running behind bitcoind only pass transactions/blocks that conform to the requirements of the version of the software they are running. So if 99% of people are running v2.0, for example, while 1% are running v1.5, and there are serious incompatibilities between the two, a miner that mines a block using the 1.5 standard won't be able to propagate it through the network as 99% of people see it as an invalid block. Also, people wanting to spend money with a 1.5 client will probably be unable to unless they update to 2.0. In this way the blockchain is verified: only transactions/blocks that fit in with the majority's protocol will last.
PS: those version numbers are fake. I believe the reference client is v0.8.3 or something. v0.9 will be released soon.

Some researcher(s) had an idea recently that would solve a lot of problems. Bear/bare with me here as I don't remember everything perfectly
* &lt; 1 minute blocks. I think it was like 5 seconds or something.
* instead of the "correct" chain being determined by length, it is determined by number of blocks built on top of it (imagine a branching tree vs just a very long skinny tree with hardly any branches).
* confirmations = number of blocks on top of block your tx is in. Again imagine tree vs long stick
* what is in a block is reworked such that they are much smaller.
With all that combined, the researcher(s) claimed that bitcoin could see 200 transactions per second with no drop in security or massive increases in block size and chain growth vs time.

yes. 


Yes/no. The wallet generates a ton for you and shows you them as you need them. Go to the receiving tab to see the first public key it made for you. 
You'll probably never see your private keys in plain text with bitcoin-qt because you don't need to. Just backup your wallet.dat every month or so and call it good. The private keys are in there. Bonus points if you encrypt it (password protect).

You're right that more electricity will probably be used as time goes on even if improvements are made in hardware as long as new people begin mining. I personally think the electricity costs are worth it as it is securing my money. If you would like to see the electricity go to something other than brute force hashing, you could check out primecoin. There are also a few altcoins that do some protein folding or something. I don't remember their names, but they are worth a read if you want to support something more than your money with your CPU cycles.

It won't compromise the security of the other addresses and make them easier to steal from or anything. But if one is publicly known to be yours and the others are not, when you go to spend money and don't manage your coin control well, the publicly-known address and the others could both be used for a transaction, thereby letting people know with reasonable certainty that those addresses belong to the same person.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:47:33

@_date: 2013-12-10 18:00:59
Can't be faked. Share = block that meets a lower difficulty than the current network one. 
So a pool will ask that all miners report blocks they find that are at least difficulty 2. The network difficulty is 707 million right now. So most of the blocks the miners report to the pool will not meet the requirements, but eventually one will. The pool then can use the number of shares that everyone reported finding to divvy up the block reward proportionate to the amount of hash power everyone has.

Very good idea. If you want an easy way to manage both wallets side-by-side, take a look at multibit. Harder to use but same idea: armory. Armory can be safer, it just requires more knowledge and patience.
Q2: 
I'm not quite sure how to answer this. I think if bitcoin is going to become an every day currency that local shops accept in the future, a mobile platform is a must. That means a mobile wallet. For right now, I don't think it would be required of you to get a smart phone just so you can carry your bitcoins in your pocket. Like you said, no one accepts them in your area.

In some cases this is possilbe (wallets that let you import keys. Usually a feature of desktop wallets though). Just because it is possible, however, does not mean it is recommended. You could accidently send the same money from both places at the same time, and who's to know which transaction would go through first. You might also think you have more than you actually do. Or think someone stole your money! 
Another reason is because there's no way we will ever run out of keys, let alone generate the same one twice on accident. So we use that to our advantage and make it a little more confusing for someone trying to follow the money and determine who owns what address. Some people even recommend generating a new address for every single transaction.


First, determine what level this hacker is on. Is he hacking your computer and gaining access to your wallet? Then only your computing habits are stopping him. Once he gains access to your wallet and the contained private keys, he can empty your wallet instantly and you have no hope of getting those coins back. It's just like carrying a wallet stuffed full of cash around your neck while walking through the bad part of town. 
Now, if you mean "hacking bitcoin," then that's an slightly different story. Assume there are no serious bugs in the source code of every client people use (huge assumption, btw). Now the only way to really steal someones money is to get access to their private keys, just like I stated above. Without your private keys, no one can just reroute your money, no matter how much hashing power they have. What someone **could** do is this. You sell them a couch for 2 BTC (nice couch?). Once the bad guy sends the money to your wallet, he also sends the money to himself with a higher transaction fee and hopes the second transaction catches on first. The main problem with this is any smart person waits for confirmations before cosidering a transaction good. Especially if a large amount of money is at stake. 
It is interesting to note that no double spend (the process I just described) has been successfully executed. Well, not with malicious intent. During the 0.7.x --&gt; 0.8 transition, one guy decided to try a double spend since the blockchain was split into two similarily lengthed strings about 2-6 blocks long. He pulled it off, but refunded the money to the scammed party. ^(I may not have all these facts right about the guy, I don't remember the story very well)

~1:40 talking about how people will eventually not want to download the entire blockchain and have to use bitcoin banks or super nodes:
this is already a problem for some people. However, "lite" clients exist that don't rely on the entire blockchain being stored locally. Electrum, a popular one, does require on you selecting and trusting a node from a list of electrum nodes to send transactions to you. Multibit, another very popular one, just downloads the block *headers*, no where near as big. AND it only downloads enough to know your transactions are good and the money you get is good. It doesn't download the entire history.

Imagine for a second that you have never heard of ripple or bitcoin. 
Your friend comes up to you and tells you about bitcoin and that you should get some. You say okay. He tells you how to do it.
Option 1:
* Make an account at ripple.com
* go to the thread and beg for some of this ripple stuff. You aren't sure why this is necessary because all you want is some bitcoin, but whatever.
* eventually someone gives some to you. Yay sweet.
* make an account at peercover.com ([btw, wtf is this supposed to mean? It doesn't sound anything like an exchange business. ]( oh. And their website has wayyy too many scripts required to just get it to come up.
* do whatever is necessary to buy bitcoin there.
Option 2:
* make an account at coinbase.com (for example)
* hook up bank account
* buy bitcoin
* waiting period until you get them, yes, but this method feels less shady and it gives you an opportunity to research what the fuck you are doing. Not just getting some random credit things from some random forum on the internet.

If someone managed to buy a large percent of the bitcoins out there (keep in mind that not very many are for sale at a given time), that would only drive the price up for the remaining coins. 
Say 20 million coins are now in the hands of the US government sometime in the future. That leaves ~1 million for everyone else. BUT, each coin is now worth $100,000 each since the government bought it way way up. In order to sell things at a reasonable price, people just set the price at 0.00001000 BTC instead of whatever it is now.

change addresses look exactly the same as "normal" addresses. There is no difference as far as the blockchain is concerned.

They claim to have no control over your private keys. I am inclined to believe them. They claim that all the decrypting and such is done locally on your computer *in your browser*. So if your browser has addons or toolbars, you might need to be worried.
Trust blockchain.info a lost more than coinbase's web wallet or any other service's web swallet because they don't let you have any control of your private keys. If they go under or the owners end up beign crooks, you are screwed. If blockchain.info goes under, you have automatic email backups you can import into another wallet. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:57:13
1) coinbase covers the fee for you. Right now the generally-accept "safe" fee is 0.0005 no matter what volume you are moving. Feel free to low ball it if you don't need your tx to go through in the next block or want to try to drive the generally-accept "safe" fee down. Basically the fee is up to you (unless you are using a web wallet that covers it for you).
These days it is very hard to get transactions through with 0 fee. Be prepared to wait a day if you don't include a fee. Also be prepared to have it not go through at all.

I'm not sure what kind of volume you need, and I'm even less familiar with bitcoin services outside of the US. But you could try to find a way to do something like this.
US bank --&gt; BTC business/exchange dealing with USD --&gt; transfer BTC to UK business/exchange dealing with £ --&gt; withdraw to UK bank.
Coinbase lets you hook up a bank in the US, and after super verifying yourself you can buy bitcoins instantly, otherwise it takes a week to get them. They charge 1% and a bank transfer fee of $.15. Then you could send the BTC to a UK exchange and then sell them and withdraw the £ however that exchange lets you.
You could very well end up spending less on fees this way. Of course other options exist than coinbase, and I can't recommend one UK business/exchange over another. Best of luck and hopefully people you pay will eventually accept bitcoins so you don't even have to worry about this process!

Use paper wallets. 
Make sure that when you go to get the money off your paper wallet, you move ALL of it off. Some people make the mistake of importing the private key into their desktop client, spending some money, then assuming that the rest is still on the paper wallet. This is not always the case as a lot of clients will send the change to a different address in order to make it harder for someone to trace the money. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:49:30
Those are all very good questions and I unfortunately can't really remember the answers to them.

Okay. On your "receiving money" tab in blockchain.info, you should see a "new address" button near the bottom.

public/private key does not equal root key and chain code. 
Armoy generates addresses for you in a deterministic way. That means if you have the root key and chain code, it can make all the same addresses again, even if on a new computer. So what you are backing up when you back up those two things is the information needed to regenerate all the same addresses.
If armory "goes out of business" (I'm pretty sure it is just one guy or a small team of guys, not a business making money), then you can still use their software to get your money, and even move it to a different client if you want. They don't have to be alive for you to use their software.

[blockchain.info]( is the only answer I really got. No company in the BTC world is crazy about associating with credit cards, hence high fees when you do find one.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:56:32
Coinbase is great. The reason for not letting you make a second purchase is your account is new and they want to start building trust with you, that you will actually have the money. You can eventually verify yourself enough to buy coins instantly. The money still comes from your bank, the credit card is just as a back up. No extra fees.

No major wallet that I know of supports instant transactions. Given a figureative company that does do this though .. Both you and your cuatomer would have ti have an account with them. Then the company just allocates people balances without people actually having access to private keys. Not secure at all.
Just use one of the standard wallets and wait for a confirmation or two. Promise the buyer you'll work something out if the block the transaction is in get orphaned.
Both the blockchain.info wallet app and the bitcoin wallet app have exchange rates. Think they're android only.
Make sure you include a transaction fee. Current recommended minimum is around 0.0005

Yup. Leads me to believe even more that it wasn't the fault of multibit
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:56:38
Can't do this because multibit only allows you to specify one output. 
~~You can force it send change to a certain address by specifying it as a recipient of your money. Ex: you own 1bob123 and 1bob456. You have 1 btc in 1bob123.~~
**I'm pretty sure multibit just picks a random address. Maybe it goes off of # of txs an address has used or age of an address, not sure.**
@_date: 2013-03-23 21:53:52
Yes, just wait it out. That transaction is in a very recent block, which will be one of the last to be downloaded. I heard it takes up to a day these days, but I think that's with clients before 0.8
@_date: 2013-10-21 18:22:11
They are taking the following things:
* hash of previous block
* a handful of transactions
* nonce (number that can be incremented to quickly change the hash of the final product)
and hashing them together as fast as they can over and over and over until the hash of the block is above the current difficulty. Then they send it out to the network and collect the block reward. 
When you have lots and lots of people with lots of computers trying to do this all at the same time, it gets more difficult to control a significant portion of the network. If someone DID control a significant portion of the network, they could pick and choose which transactions they include in the blocks they mine and leave others out. this is called a 51% attack.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:13:21

@_date: 2013-11-04 16:17:16
go to the miner (or team of miners) that mined the block your transaction was in. They don't make the block be found any faster, but larger fees will be incentive for miners to include your tx in THIS block instead of putting it off in favor of other txs that have high fees. 0.0005 is considered "standard"
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:56:39
Yes. Backup the wallet.dat file only. Blockchain can and will be redownloaded if you ever lose your computer or move to a different one, AND it will be the same blockchain as before. (Obviously, since everyone has a copy of it and all the copies need to be the same).

Tell them that a mid-range AMD GPU will get 200 MH/s. Nice ones get 3-400 MH/s I think. Then just divide by total network hash rate. Hint: 1000 MH = ~1 GH. 1000 GH = ~1 TH. 1000 TH = ~1 PH

(assuming you're talking about the reference client, bitcoin-qt)
The wallet has a list of IPs to start connecting to. It then asks who those nodes are connected to and adds them to the list. And then asks those nodes who they are connected to and adds them to the list. Etc. 
It doesn't care where miners are. But when a new block is mined, the miners submit it to the network and all the nodes start passing it off to everyone else so everyone knows a new block has been found. Same thing with pending transactions. They are sent throughout the network so those people that aren't just running a node, but also mining, have a list of pending transactions to include in their blocks.

Yea. you should always stay pretty close to up to date unless you have a philosophical reason for keeping an old version. New versions = security fixes and new features. 
Also, IDK what the hard coded IP are and if they change, but I'm guessing they don't change much at all. They probably belong to people that have been in bitcoin for a very long time and aren't going to just go offline.
@_date: 2013-03-03 21:51:20
All right. That clears that up. Thanks.
Has a method of transferring coins on paper been developed yet?
@_date: 2013-10-08 00:02:11
That's a really big question, I'm going to try to sum up the basics quickly. You very well may already know all this. Hopefully others will give you specifics or you can find them.
1) buying bitcoins.
yes this is an investment for a lot of people. It's risky enough as it is already, isn't it? Some think so.
2) buying miners
super risky since a lot of companies are doing preorders and don't have miners ready to ship. On top of that, difficulty is skyrocketing with no end in sight yet. Also, you are very likely to end up making less from mining than you spent on the machine. Therefore it is generally assumed it is better just to spend xxx dollars on BTC instead of on a miner
3) investing in a group buy/guy who buys miners and distributes profits
Same as 2) only you're losing a cut to that guy/company in exchange for not having to worry about maintanence.
4) investing in a mining company
ASICMINER is the first that comes to mind. They have stock (not legally recognized by a gov't, btw) floating around that you can get your hands on. With btct.co going down, it might be a little harder to find someone looking to sell there's. ASICMINER pays weekly dividends.
5) ... sure I missed some.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:41:50
cash deposits, meet with someone, moneypak, dwolla (against ToS), bank transfer, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:56:06
Moneypak + localbitcoins is pretty anonymous. Other than that, selling on an exchange or some other way will probably require a bank account hooked up and that isn't anonymous.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:06:02
~~Where's the private key?~~ You probably just give the guy a public address to use.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:26:51
You're asking very speculative questions that there will be many different answers too. I personally do not think it will become some awesome global currency. But here's my take.


Increase slowly with time as the supply decreases slowly as people lose coins.


Yes and no. They will take better care of their money as it will be worth more in the future, but they will still by necessities and indulge every now and then. But they will be smarter about it as the sunk cost in the new TV gets larger and larger with time. Again, hopefully very slowly.


Idk. I don't think anyone can know for sure.


What? Why would bitcoin do that?


No. At this point I'm not sure if you are trolling or not, but if you're serious, don't think that some new currency is going to change the world into a nice, utopian, every-one-is-equal society.

I think you're right that it would be possible for there to be more. It is just very unlikely as lots of people use bitcoin because of it's hard limit. We can make it seem like there's more by multiplying everyone's balance by 10^n, and we can extend the decimal place. Neither of which are overly disruptive. But changing the decaying nature of the block reward takes away one of the fundamentals of bitcoin and I don't think enough people would ever get behind it. Or at least enough important people. If in 20 years every single person is using it like they use facebook, then most people won't care to keep up with the inner workings. But people that run nodes or work on the code or run mining farms will care and will more than likely be against anything that changes bitcoin in a significant way such that it could lose its perceived value.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:31:55


Easy calculations? 50 BTC a block for 4 years then 25 from jan-&gt;april. Vs 25 BTC a block for the last two months? Blocks take ~10 minutes to be found.

Others correct me if I'm wrong, but it is a proposal to count confirmations of block X by the number of blocks on top of it (Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4), not by the longest chain on top of it (Y, Z, A, B, ...). With this and related modifications, the author(s) of the paper propose we could solve some of the basic scalability problems bitcoin is facing: the number of transactions the network can handle per unit of time vs. the security of knowing those transactions are good.

Your wall of text is overwhelming...

* what kind of paper wallet? If it is something like http:bitaddress.org, then no... cause it is only one address. If you have one that blockchain.info gives you and it has all the information needed to recover your full wallet, then probably not. I'm not familiar with their paper backup solutions.
* No. You'll jsut potentially have more keys
* If you're still talking about blockchain.info, yes you'll be fine if they close up shop.
* no
* right
* depends on how paranoid you're being. Remember, you don't have 50 BTC. Asses your risk and decide from there. Sometimes it isn't worth being paranoid over 0.01 BTC.

Yes. If there's no extension of the # of decimal places 1 BTC is divisible to (currently 8), then the block reward can be expected to round down to zero at some point. At that time, tx fees would be the entire reward to miners.

Well instead you're using a highly insecure protocol to send something very important and tieing it directly to your email address and your receiver's. It would be smarter to just use some good coin management practices and send him the coins the good ol' fashion way. 
Oh, and on top of that, he's trusting that after you send him the wallet you're not going to send the coins out of it before he can spend them. No one in the right mind would accept an emailed wallet.dat as payment

They combine 
* last block hash
* hash of lots of pending transactions
* a nonce
into one hash as fast as possible until the final hash meets the current difficulty. The first one to do this gets the block reward and tx fees. It is useful because they are the ones that are validating transactions and making sure no money is being spent twice.

it is a piece of paper (usually) that contains all the information you need in order to add money to it, and at some point import it into an online wallet so you can spend them. They are considered much safer than online wallets as, when made correctly, they have a very small chance of having the private key hacked/stolen/etc.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:18:43


I think it *is* relevant because the bitcoin network **could** possibly handle the same number of transactions as the banks. Or at least a bank, because there's no guarantee that bitcoin will become the "ultimate, one curenncy for the entire world" as we like to sometimes think.
It is also fair to include the power cost of printing money, as the miners are essentially doing that too. And if you want to get more abstract, then the cost of moving currencies/commodities around (example: shipping gold). 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:37:27
outside of the US, probably best to find an exchange and just remember to buy regularly there.
Remember to move the money out of the exchange/coinbase though! Don't want to lose your fortune just because they go out of business, get hacked, etc.

Yes the race starts over, unless you've configured your miner to try really hard to get some specific transactions into that specific block number for some reason. Yes transactions not included in the most recent block stay on the network for miners to pull from and include in the next block or the next. After a while though, most nodes drop old transactions so you can try again with a higher fee or something.
Solo miners are inherently nodes. If you mine in a pool (on a team), then no. You get work from the pool operator. He is the only necessary full node.
Miner: most common one is cgminer I think. It allows you to mine with your GPU or most ASICs. Don't have to be a node.
Node: bitcoin-qt/bitcoind (the reference client). Also, armory just because it runs bitcoind in the background.

If you trust the password you used to encrypt your wallet is strong enough that if dropbox ended up being malicious/forking your data over to someone, they couldn't crack it, then yea it's generally accepted as safe.
Same with the flashdrive. In addition, you can put a password-protected wallet file inside a truecrypt-encrypted flash drive for DOUBLE THE SECURITY!!!!1!!11!!! (seriously a good idea if you have a lot of money in BTC. Just have more than one flash drive too)
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:54:48
I think you're thinking too literally. Transactions don't include information on specific coins (or fractions of coins), but instead contain information about the *amount* transferred between two addresses. Just like the US government doesn't track their legal tender by the bill. This $20 could've been used to buy cocaine, but that was 100 transactions ago. If it's not counterfeit, then no big deal to me. 
If you are worried that you received money from someone doing illegal things, then send them through a mixing service. As far as I know, those just send them through so many transactions and addresses that it's nearly impossible to track coins in/out.
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:25:09
The miner (team of them) get 25 BTC plus the fees of all the txs in the block. So it is separate from the 25 BTC reward, but goes to the same place.

@_date: 2013-11-04 15:31:30
Well, yes it should. Did you generate private keys somehow? If so, hopefully you did use complex criteria to do that. But that doesn't matter if they're all in a list in a .txt file. Then someone just grabs them and imports them into his own wallet. You should encrypt your wallet with a very complex password.
I think you might be confusing encryption and encoding. In the context of bitcoin: Encryption = password protect your wallet.dat. Encoding = generating private keys in such a way you can generate them again down the line.

* that is delivering NOW or very soon

If you're solo mining on a CPU, you're basically never going to see any money magically appear. You're just too small of a part of the network. 
Now, if you're just using the windows client as a wallet and you haven't taken the steps to make it mine for you (hint: don't), then you haven't been mining. All you're doing is using the reference client instead of a different one and keeping a full copy of the blockchain on your computer. Keeping and distributing the blockchain as well as new blocks and transactions is what it takes to be a full node. So you are a full node, but you're not mining.
BTW, when it comes to mining, if you're doing it solo, you get the 25 BTC reward + tx fees in that block all at once. You don't mine solo and get little bits of bitcoins here and there. If you're in a pool, you get little bits of bitcoin whenever the pool finds a block.

There is a short list of nodes hard coded into the wallet, but from there it finds out who else those nodes are connect to and connect to those people and finds out who they are connected to and can connect to those people, etc. etc.
You can also manually specify nodes you ALSO want to connect to or nodes you ONLY want to connect to. This is by IP address. 
You can connect to my node, for example, web.mineoas.us
@_date: 2013-06-18 15:20:08
Because it's not certain coins that are attributed to your address, but a certain balance. Transactions are a transfer of balance, not coin(s).
Therefore, you need a copy of the full history of all the transactions in order to know what your final balance is. Obviously with light clients, web wallets, etc. that copy is not on your computer, but it is somewhere.

Try pointing out to him that USD aren't backed by gold either. Most (all?) of the world's traditional currencies are backed by nothing more than the government that issues them. And those governments get their power from the people. So if people lose faith in their government and overthrow it, their currency could be ruined as well. 
You could also compare it to the value of collectibles. They get their current value based on how much people value them. You can compare it to current exchange rates between traditional currencies.
Some people also believe that bitcoin draws some of its worth from the energy spent to "generate" them. Miners value them because they represent what they spent on hardware/energy/etc. It's secured by cryptography and strong because people trust math.
edit: basically, he's right that it only has value because people agree it does. But there's more to it.

It is possible to put your private key on a mag strip/qr code on a card that you carry with you. But every time you swipe your card, you're giving the merchant your private key. Weeks later, they could take all the private keys they've collected and steal everyone's money. Not good.

PTP? do you mean peer to peer? That could mean anything from meeting someone (physically p2p), to the way the bitcoin network works. I'm going to assume the latter.
Now, if you know how the bittorrent network works and how you download/upload to lots of people, then you now understand how the bitcoin networks sends around the blockchain, new blocks, new transactions, etc. That's what p2p means in this context. There's no central server all nodes connect to. Every full node ~can~ connect to every other full node (usually only connects to 8 or so).
The blockchain is the data the nodes are storing and sharing with new nodes. It contains all the transactions ever. 
Let me know if you want to know more.
@_date: 2013-10-20 00:03:53
Similar. Difficulty is a number recalculated every 2016 blocks that makes it more difficult to mine if the hash rate is higher than it was 2016 blocks ago. The hash rate is just how many guess a second the network is making. You can compare it to the number of guesses a second your miner is making and process to feel sorry for yourself as you become less and less significant :)

Pool = team of miners. If you were to join a pool, you'd buy mining hardware, go to their website, figure out how to have your mining software talk to the pool, configure the mining software to do so, then start mining. The pool keeps track of how hard everyone is working and whenever someone in the pool finds a block, it divides up the reward based on how hard everyone worked.

What you're asking about is an escrow service. A few exist for bitcoin already, I just can't name them as I don't really use them. Google would help, haha. 
Anyway, at its most primal, you can create a transaction that 2 of 3 people have to sign for it to go through. If buy and seller are happy, then they both sign and the escrow person doesn't have to get involved. Otherwise, if one person isn't happy, the escrow person has to decide who deserves the money and can sign/not sign based on that decision. 
That is how it can work with the existing protocol. Most escrow websites for bitcoin don't even use this method.

The most important part if you want to do more than just hold a copy of the blockchain is to forward port 8333 to your computer. If you don't, you only make 8 outward connections. If you forward port 8333, you can accept incoming ones.

There's one more copy of the blockchain out there so it is that much harder to shut down bitcoin by some sort of seizure of all the nodes.
You also help block propagation.  
You can "cast a vote" if you will on what protocol you think is the right one. If there's a change in the latest version you don't like, well then just keep using the old one. If you're not running a node, you don't have much say.

Here is a quick analogy.
Address = credit card
Wallet = leather wallet.
Your wallet can hold many addresses (keys). The public key is kind of like your credit card number: you give it to people when you want them to send you money. There's nothing wrong with your public key(s) to be posted all over the internet. Your private keys, on the other hand, must be kept secret. For every private key there is exactly one public key. Knowing the private key for a given public key lets you spend money from it.
Public keys look like this: 1thisIsAPublicKey.
Private keys look like this: 5thisIsAPrivateKey.
You usually don't know what your private keys are because you don't need to know. They are stored in your wallet file. That wallet file is all you need to back up in order to be able to restore your wallet at a later date. Still make regular backups because sometimes your wallet will make new addresses without telling you.

Only because it is very new. Bitcoin was like this. If you want quark to be like bitcoin in a few years (maybe even replace it), then you'll see the same thing happen. Yes people will still be able to start mining quark immediately with their CPU (which, BTW, they can still technically do with bitcoin), but they won't mine much of anything. 
In addition, if quark takes off, better and more efficient mining hardware will be manufactured. Reducing the profitability of CPU miners in the process.

~~Not anymore.~~ Sorry. started copy/pasting this from somewhere else. Forgot this line. 
Node = holding a copy of the blockchain and relaying pending transactions and new blocks.
(solo) Mining = being a node + taking a bunch of pending transactions and basically hashing them and the previous block together into a single hash, hoping it meets the current difficulty, and if not, adding one to the end and hashing again. over and over and over.... until you find a hash that meets the required difficulty. Then you relay the block to the rest of the network.
(pooled) mining = mining on a team. A central node sends out information on pending transactions and the current block to lots of people, they hash away and tell the central node if they find a good hash. Main difference is you don't have to have a copy of the blockchain.

No. keys never change. They are also called addresses. Then it might make more sense. Just like your home address doesn't change when you make a baby or have company over, your address doesn't change when you receive money multiple times with it. 
Also, now that I think about it, you *may* be confusing addresses/keys with a wallet.

There is no limit on the number of blocks to be solved. You might be thinking about the block reward eventually dying away as it is halved every ~4 years. That's where the maximum of just under 21 million bitcoins existing comes from.
Anyway, when the block reward starts to become insignificant, two things will happen (and could be said to already be happening). 1) some miners will stop mining as it is no longer profitable. 2) transaction fees will hopefully be significant compared to the block reward. At some point the entire reward for finding a block will come from transaction fees. It's very well could become a delicate game of how high of a transaction fee will get your transaction through fast enough for you someday in the future since you'll be competing for space in blocks with everyone else.

The other people are talking about mining, which is probably what you meant. But you could also contribute to the network by running a node. If you forward the right port correctly and (either manually or over time) connect to lots of nodes, you can help relay pending transactions and new blocks to the rest of the network.

It is safer in the fact that offline protects you from malware sending real-time reports to someone listening and some keyloggers.

Just explain exactly what is going on when people mine? If that is even relevant. I doubt it is for an economics class. Just tell them they are generated in a predictable, and per-determined way that trails off at the end such that there is a hard limit on the money supply. You can't just print coins off or copy/paste them.

1) the two networks would continue on as if nothing was different. When they recombine, the network would do its best to include transactions from each chain, but basically only transactions that have unspent outputs would be included.
2) Transaction fees are supposed to be fluid (right now most clients have a fee hard coded. I hate it). As value goes up, that puts pressure for tx fees to go down. As more people use it, that puts pressure for the tx fee to go up. Ideally things will work themselves out as people who need transactions to go through very soon will pay higher fees while those that can wait a while will pay lower ones.

That is a hugely speculative question and I don't think anyone knows the answer for sure. 
My personal prediction is this: bitcoin will not become some big multi-national world currency, but will instead exist as a small commodity that some people buy in order to send money quickly to people all over the world or make online purchases quickly and possibly anonymously. I don't think a government will make it their official currency. Instead, I think it has the potential to put businesses like MoneyGram out of business. I think countries will bring about their own currency devaluation (ahem, USA) with or without Bitcoin existing. Whatever happens, we will see.
If it did reach $1 million dollars a coin (or, if hyperinflation, some other large number that means you can buy a very nice house for 1 BTC), that would be AWESOME. I hope so.

He's a little right. Only when you look at based on time. Say a two week interval. 
* Network hashrate rises very drastically over the two weeks. Therefore more than 2016 blocks are mined in that time and thus there are *more* coins mined in that time.
* Network hashrate stays very steady over the two weeks. Basically 2016 blocks are mined in that time and thus there are basically the expected number of coins mined.
* Network hashrate drops very drastically over the two weeks.  Therefore less than 2016 blocks are mined in that time and thus there are *less* coins mined in that time.
So he's right in that we go from very much the first option, to just the first option. No longer are we mining ~2050 (for ex) blocks every two weeks, but "only" ~2030 blocks.

* It is where most of the development support is
* It is where most of the mining support is
* Most altcoins change very little and exist for nothing more than a get-rich-quick scheme for the first few people on board
* Those that **do** change some significant things about bitcoin haven't convinced most bitcoiners that those changes are important or make the coin better. I would argue Scrypt vs SHA-256 is a significant change. Also, shorter confirmation times, **but** not stupidly short ones like 15 seconds.

you don't have to check with the network whether or not the addresses you make are unique because the number of possible addresses is very **very** large. Don't worry about it.
It isn't anonymous. Is is psuedo-anonymous. You can go to blockchain.info and see all the transactions happening, but not necessarily know who is sending money around. It stops being anonymous when an address is somehow tied to you. 
You can't just give yourself more bitcoins by modifying the wallet.dat. Please do more reading about how transactions work and what the miners are doing. I recommend the bitcoin wiki,

Okay. Yes that movement is out of band since the offline computer is, by definition, not connected to the internet and you must somehow get the transaction to the internet. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:34:27
You can't spend the coins out of a cold/offline wallet with blockchain.info without having your private keys in your blockchain.info wallet 
... 
Or at least not without really knowing what you are doing. [Technically you can make a raw transaction on the offline computer and copy/paste it here and submit it to the network this way]( In this way you keep you keep your private keys away from the internet. 
Anyway, I'm pretty sure you aren't talking about that feature and were kind of confused about how to spend money in a cold wallet. The easiest way is to export/import the private keys you need into an online wallet and spend the money. Then consider the coins unsafe and send any change to another cold address you have. Now, if you really were talking about that broadcast-raw-tx feature I linked to you, then just know the network doesn't really keep tabs on what keys have been generated into existence. It just checks that the raw transaction was signed correctly with all the keys that are inputs in the transaction. That can be done without anyone knowing your private key. This is how devices like the Trezor work. All the private keys are stored on a super secure device, it signs them, then you move the signed transaction to an online computer and broadcast it.

Cool. I won't argue your "nothing to hide" statement, because I also feel I am a good law-abiding citizen. I would like to present an argument I saw earlier for something similar, but I feel still applies. This is for everyone, not just pointed at you, Basically it is this. If you use a single address/small number of addresses, it is trivial to see how much money you have coming in/out of them during their entire existence. This means that if you have 3 BTC coming in on the 1st of every month, for example, it would be pretty reasonable to assume that is your salary. Or, if you're sending large amounts of money to an address that is to known to belong to a bar or a gambling website, you may not be "hire-able material" or something. For this reason I advocate having a larger list of addresses to choose from: to make it harder to track these things. If you want to go crazy, you don't use an address more than once.

Get started by downloading vanitygen. Then write a program to check the balances of every address it finds. Be sad when they are all zero
Or you could target one specific private key with vanitygen. Just run until done. 
Or you could use a brainwallet generator and feed it common words/phrases and check balances. Bonus points if you store the generated addresses just in case someone starts using it later.

As the incentive to mine drops, wouldn't you expect existing miners to lessen in numbers? Or at the very least keep the same numbers? How is a shrinking pool of miners good for a coin that (presumably) wants to do better than BTC and really make it big--say, a world currency? $10 million worth of mining hardware in a few hands is worse than $100 billion worth of mining hardware in many hands (made up numbers, talking about future). Not only is the power to make decisions about what transactions to include in blocks more centralized, but the cost to attack the network is much lower. The more money protecting my money the better.

The problem with most/all altcoins (I will specifically argue against Litecoin here), is they try to make demand where it doesn't exist, or create a problem that doesn't exist. 
* Litecoin block target is 2.5 minutes instead of 10 minutes. 4x faster for 4x less secure. And STILL not fast enough for buying coffee.
* LTC = silver, BTC = gold. No. Just no. BTC doesn't need a silver--a counter part that is worth less--for transactions that aren't worth as much because BTC doesn't have divisibility issues like gold does. Want to buy a beer instead of a car? Just send less BTC. Buying a car with gold might make a little sense, but not a beer.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:38:40
No. Litcoiners like to spout "bitcoin = gold, litecoin = silver." It is a crock of shit. We don't need silver. We can just send a smaller amount of gold.

It is unlikely that it will be incompatible. But if there's going to be an incompatibility, there will probably be lots of warning. In addition, you could just backup the program as well so you are sure you have a way to get the coins out.


Your client does not tell the network what addresses you have.

Try reading the bitcoin wiki or something as well. You have lots of questions, which is good, but they are basically "how does bitcoin work deep down on the inside" and I'm not sure many people want to answer so many of them all at once when the answers already exist. 
bitcoin wiki: 
Now I will proceed to give some background, vocab, etc. in hopes that it clarifies your understanding without answering each individual question in your comment.
Vocab: 
* node - someone who has a copy of the blockchain and is relaying new transactions and new blocks to everyone else
* miner - someone who is either running a node or part of a pool, and is seeing what new transactions there are on the network, combining them with the hash of the previous block and a nonce (easy incremented number) over and over until they find a hash that meets the required difficulty. Then they broadcast that to the network of nodes. That hash that combines the previous block and some pending transactions is called a block.
* block (blockchain as well) - what you have pictured in picture one. I'm pretty sure "merkle root" has to do with the transactions that are included and a way for you to follow them down the blockchain. Little above me. **edit: but somehow the hashes work out where you can see where the coins come from and where they are going. And thus can follow an input all the way back.**
* pool - simply put: team of miners
So ... in a sense, yes everyone has their own chain they are working on, but it is more than likely the same from top to bottom since whenever a miner finds a new block they broadcast it in hopes that the entire network sees it and starts building off of it. You get competing chains sometimes when more than one miner finds a block at roughly the same time, but these cases usually resolve themselves very quickly as someone finds the next block and puts it on top of one or the other
Okay. So... there's a little quick information that hopefully helps. You might find  helpful. You can see blocks and the included transactions as they appear on the network. You can see inputs and outputs for transactions and learn about how coins exist. It... is all very confusing. Do more reading if you want the nitty gritty. The wiki ( is a great place to start. and  is a great place to actually see what's in a block.

I'm going to try to answer your question by poviding not-very-solid answers since no one is being helpful yet.


Right. Unless you import addresses into your wallet or something. Then you need to back those up too.


I'm pretty sure there's no limit. There probably is a practical limit related to how long it takes to scan the blockchain every start up for new transactions when you have 1000s of them. But you should be fine. 
Btw, your paper backup of your armory wallet is not really a paper wallet. A paper wallet is really a paper *address* that has all the information necessary on it to receive/spend bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-08 15:15:06


The number of bitcoins you have are stored in the blockchain. What you have on your computer are private keys to addresses. Your client looks at the blockchain and all the transactions in/out of your addresses to determine your final balance.


Your client just broadcasts to the network that you would like to send money. Your client hashes together all the important information and broadcasts it. I guess you could say it's transmitted like this: [905210e2e8a5977712eb471f60ed2d32281e84b4e4fb0b49b76d4cd7dc3a8d2b](


I'm pretty sure the answer is no, despite the civil argument somewhere else on this thread. I think the only difference between just backing up the keys and backing up the wallet file is the wallet file backs up labels and transaction notes as well. When in doubt, back up both ways and back up often.


Yes they all have basically the same data (one might have more pending transactions than others if they were broadcasted seconds ago). The data they are storing is the blockchain, which is home to all the transactions that have ever taken place. This way, everyone running a full node can know how big of a balance any bitcoin address currently has. It is a self-maintaining system where nodes broadcast and listen for new transactions and blocks. 


Yes, technically it is possible. Nothing amazing happens. Just that the second person to generate the address will suddenly see the balance associated with it to be added to his total balance in his wallet. If he is smart, he'd transfer the money away from the shared address into one of his own. Please do note that you are more likely to be struck by lightning 100 times in a row while also winning all the lotteries in the world at the same time, and also getting hit by every car in the world (made that up, but its really really unlikely to ever happen).

There are a few trusted ones hard-coded into the software. If you don't want to trust them, you can manually specify nodes your client can ONLY connect to, or even nodes you want it to connect to IN ADDITION to ones it finds on its own.

Print off a handful of paper wallets at  If you're not dealing with what you consider a large amount of money, you don't need much more security than just sending long-term-holding money to paper wallets. 
If you want more security, you start doing stuff like saving that webpage and running it offline. Or running it on a different computer. Or in linux live CD. Or using a printer once. Or writing it down by hand. Or using dice. Or ... etc. It just comes down to how much money you're dealing with.

1) you might be confusing transactions on the blockchain from person to person in BTC with exchanges. To answer your question about always being a buyer/seller, it depends on the exchange and the current price. If you have money in your account on the exchange, then buys/sells should be very quick/instant.
2) Just always double check addresses you're sending to before you hit send. You usually can't mess up with a simple typo as an address includes a checksum at the end that won't verify if you messed up somewhere.
3) sure. Bitcoin can make a good store of value (gotta assume it's going up and not going to fail)

Three different answers so far... let me offer yet another. I think its a graph of the price that the last trades were executed at. Y axis is value, X axis is NOT time, but rather just moves with each trade. So when lots of trades are happening, the graph scrolls quickly. When the market is calmer, the graph moves slowly.

because it is very unlikely that the tx would go through without a tx fee. the protocol supports divisions that low because in the future 0.0001 could be worth $1000 or something and fees would drop to 0.0000001 for example.
If you were using a different wallet, it might actually let you try to send the tx. There's just not a good change it would go through without a fee. Especially being really small.
@_date: 2013-08-08 22:23:09
I have one and have printed off about 20 wallets. It has remember and forget mode, the difference being whether or not you want to backup the keys externally (and to a FDD when inserted). 
Its very handy and I imagine I'll use it in the future for paying people. The code is open source so it shouldn't be too hard to add a custom logo or change the layout. 
It also hooks up to a monitor, mouse, keyboard and has a desktop environment. If you want, you can hook it up to the internet and use eletrum (included). 
The only downside, IMO, is the speed it prints. But its not a huge issue. Its understandable running on just a rpi and all. It takes about 30 seconds.

You're right in the first part of your question that there isn't much of an immediate incentive for the consumer to spend 1% on bitcoins to buy something when they could just use a credit card. Some merchants over come this buy offering a discount if you pay with bitcoin. I think what most people are hoping is that more and more merchants will accept them in the future, people will either be easily and cheaply capable of moving USD &lt;--&gt; BTC or just get paid in BTC, and thus won't necessarily be losing part of their money in the conversion. So you could vew that 1% fee at coinbase as a "hey look there are people that use bitcoin and thus more places should accept it and more people adopt it" fee.
No it really shouldn't affect the market cap, as that's calculated simply by price * number of coins mined, and the consumer's buy should roughly balance out the merchant's sell. Market cap with bitcoin is a little misleading there's no way all the coins mined are up for sale **and** not all the ones that are for sale are for sale at the current market price.
@_date: 2013-10-08 04:55:26


more accurately, that string of charcters is (one of) your addresses. Think of addresses as debit card numbers. In addition to the public dedit card number, you also have a private number (string of characters) which is what allows your wallet to spend coins. Without the secret number, people can only send you money at the address on the front of your debit card. 
Think of bitcoins as just balances on your debit cards. You send part of your balance away, and now you have fewer bitcoins. They exist similarly to cash in a bank, you just can't go anywhere and get them in your hands.


Technically, right now they are divisible to 8 places, but the source code can easily be edited to allow more decimal places. We'd just need a majority of the network to agree that more places are needed.


Coins can only be spent by the person(s) that know the secret key that is the partner of the public key on the front of all your debit cards in your wallet. So if that's just you and your computer is secure, you should be fine. If you have a web wallet other than blockchain.info (or another one I'm not familiar with, but is similar), then you DON'T have control of your private keys and are trusting the companies. blockchain.info is unique because you have access to your private keys and they claim to never know them.


In a file on your computer. Or on the server of the web wallet that you use. Similarily, it can be said they store your bitcoins, but it would be better to think that the blockchain stores your bitcoins if you really want to think of them as physically somewhere. What's really happening is a tranfer of balances between people's debit cards that is all recorded in the blockchain so everyone can know at any time how much money is at a given address.
Keep the questions coming. I'm going to bed soon, but will always help.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:30:03
doubtful. Unless you had the private keys of the addresses the money was stored on, you are hypothetically out of luck. 
I didn't use the SR so I don't know how they managed your money. My guess is you did not have access to your private keys. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:55:24
You should never keep very much in exchange accounts. You do not control your private keys. You are also screwed if their security is low and they get hacked. You should move them out of the exchange into whatever you want as soon as you can.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:11:21
The reason is because when you spend money from an address, you (generally speaking) have to spend it all. So the wallet will send any extra to a change address. Most wallets do not automatically make the change address the same as the address you are sending from. So you'll spend money, walk away thinking you still have some money on your paper wallet. But you actually have that money on your online wallet. If that online wallet is lost, there goes your money you thought was on your paper wallet.

@_date: 2013-10-08 15:20:41
The miners decide which transactions will be included in each block. We say that, but know it isn't really a conscious decision that the people are making. Most mining software is designed to just accept all valid transactions, and to try to include those with larger tx fees first in hopes of getting them into a block before someone else does.
If you send btc and it doesn't get into a block for like 24 hours, you can usually close your wallet, reopen it, and try sending the money again (with a fee this time). Once the second one goes through, any nodes that were still holding onto the first one (usually very few after such a long time) will see that it is invalid and never confirm it.

@_date: 2013-11-11 22:11:25
Blocks don't have to have transactions in them. They include 
* hash of previous block
* any pending transactions
* nonce
and miners hash away, changing the nonce until they find a hash that combines all those things into a hash with at least a predetermined number of leading zeros. The first block has a magic number for the "hash of previous block" part. And, like, (edit: at least) the first 1000 blocks or so had no transactions in them except the block reward.

Both. Just a full node + port 8333 forwarded = relaying pending transactions and new blocks to the rest of the network


What I just said


Bundle up a bunch of pending transactions into a block, check if the hash of the block meets the required difficulty, if not, then +1 to the end and try again. Over and over and over. 


Full node. Mine on ASICs: It is the only way you can make a very small dent for cheap. Yea, mining on a GPU (if you have one) won't hurt the network, but it won't make you money and it will shorten its life.

You're right that the two functions meet when transfering $10K through coinbase. There are other exchanges that have lower fees though. Most of them are percentages as opposed to flat fees however. I'd image it is because most of the people going to these businesses right now do not have $10K to spend, so the businesses charge a small percentage since it hurts less. While traditional banks charge flat fees since they know they'll have big pockets sending money every day.

Just to clarify about anyone altering the code:
If you want to modify the official code that Gavin and the other lead developers are working on, you can either fork it and have total control over your own copy, or fork it, make minor changes/fixes and submit a pull request to the lead developers and developing community and hope they like it and pull it into the existing code base. 
So it's harder than "anyone can alter the code" sometimes makes it sound.

I don't know where bitaddress.org gets their randomness, to be honest. If you are super worried, you should check out vanitygen. Aside from generating addresses that start with a string you want, you can just have it generate addresses randomly from /dev/urandom or /dev/random. That's probably what FreeBSD does, b/c I know that's where most/all Linux OSes get randomness from. 
Yea I've heard methods where people have hand crafted addresses from dice roles and such. You just want to do it many many times to make sure you have enough entropy. I haven't done that and have no other suggestions on how to do it right.

It is entirely possible for the extra amount to go back to the sending address. But some people like the extra obscurity obtained by getting a portion of there money automatically sent to a new address every time it is spent. Even if you don't care about staying obscure, you can just let the wallet do it in the background anyway as it doesn't really affect you.
The reason you have to overspend sometimes is bitcoins don't even really exist as a balance at an address, but as a list of unspent inputs at an address. So if you have a 1 BTC unspent input and a 1.5 BTC unspent input at the same address, and you want to spend 2 BTC, the client as to take BOTH of those unspent inputs and make a transaction with the entire 2.5 BTC. It will send 2 BTC to where ever you want, and send the remaining 0.5 BTC to either an address of your choice or a new change address (just depends on the client and how flexible it is with letting you choose these things).

If the paper wallet is empty, then you just have a key pair that doesn't have any funds in the blockchain allocated to it. Once you send money to the paper wallet using an online one, the blockchain now knows that the paper wallet has money allocated to it. Then in the future when you want to spend that money, you just import the paper wallet into an online wallet and send the coins away.
You could print off 100 Million paper wallets and never send any money to them and no one would even know or care. All a address is, is a key to the balance associated with it in the blockchain. And all a wallet is is a collection of addresses. (confusing sometimes because a paper wallet is just 1 address)

If you subscribe to the notion that bitcoin will either be awesome and mainstream or worthless, then you're still an early adopter. It could be $100K, $1M, $1B per coin. $200 is a bargin.

If you have enough of your money in bitcoin (either now or in the future) that you are worried about hackers and keyloggers and such, then you'll take a look at keeping your wallet on an offline computer. 100% safe if the transaction signing is done offline and then the raw transaction is brought to an online computer and broadcast to the network. Also, bitcoin is 5 years old. In time, simple and super-safe methods of storing coin with be developed. I can almost guarantee it. The internet wasn't easy to use at first either.
I've never seen a brick-and-mortar business accept a check but not cash. Checks can bounce, cash cannot. In addition, you can check and be reasonably sure the cash is not counterfeit. As far as online businesses go, obviously cash can't be used as it is physical. That is why a digital representation of USD is needed. Or, something like bitcoin. Bitcoin is almost exactly like cash (but on the internet) as the transactions cannot be reversed. In addition, the money you receive is guaranteed 100% to be good and spendable (after a few confirmations).

Too long. Have to be in a pool, so I'd expect he'd want to see you set that account up. Then configure your client. Then mine. CPU? Won't see pennies in months. GPU? Will see them in a few hours, but not in an address you control because the pools have minimum payouts. ASICs? Similar deal. 
You can't solo mine and get small payouts. You just wait till you find a block, then get the massive 25BTC + fees reward. And you're not going to do that on "standard hardware" anymore.

If you are talking about mining .... then here is what miners are doing.
Combining a handful of pending transactions, the hash of the previous block, and a nonce (easily incremented number) all together into a hash. If it meets the required difficulty they found a block and broadcast it to the network. If it doesn't, they add one to the nonce and try again. As fast as they can.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:02:08

You could use gyft 100 different times and pay them with 100 different sending addresses and more than likely they won't care. The bitcoin network doesn't care. Wallet software doesn't care. The only reason to care is to track people and where their money is going.

Just maintain them as separate wallets.
You can technically import the keys of one into the other, but the trouble isn't worth it. Especially when one sends change to a different address that isn't in the other wallet. Then you may think you have coins in a wallet that only exist in the other. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 01:56:09
When you send money from address 1abc which has 2 BTC in it, but you only want to send 0.5 BTC to address 1xyz, your wallet has to spend all the coins at 1abc. So what some do is instead of sending it back to 1abc or any other address in your wallet, they make a new one for you that has never been used before (1def). So the tx would look like this.
1abc (2 BTC) -----&gt; 
-----&gt; (0.5 BTC) 1xyz
-----&gt; (1.5 BTC) 1def
(neglecting transaction fees)
The reason why some wallets do this automatically for you is so you will automatically be helping yourself remain somewhat more anonymous. In addition, a lot of people probably don't even know it is happening. As a side effect though, then people will import a paper wallet (1abc), send money to their friend at 1xyz, and not realize that their paper wallet no longer has any money on it cause it is all at 1def in their online wallet.
Also note that a lot of desktop wallets generate like 100 addresses on first run, but not show them to you until needed. Therefore, it is generally, **generally** okay to go awhile without doing another backup. Parinoid people do a backup every single time the send money.

Right. There is a little grey area in that a lot of clients will "pre-generate" addresses but not show them to you. They do this so they'll be in early backups even if you only see them for the first time a month or two later. It's good to make regular backups every now and then depending on how many transactions you are making and how often you make new addresses (or your client makes them for you).

"Current price" usually means what ever price a major exchange is sitting at. So yea, you could sell your friend a coin for $300, but the exchanges may still be sitting around $230 or something. There would have to be lots of buy pressure to eat through sell orders to make the exchange reach $300

Multibit stores the private keys differently. Multibit does it like this:

Or something like that. I might have the letters wrong around the date and time. Basically it stores each private key right next to the date/time that it is first seen on the network. That way it only has to look so far back into the past for each key. It also makes it easy to import new keys.

Yes, kind of.
It will display your IP address to others in that you need to receive new blocks/transactions, etc. But if you do not forward ports in your router correctly, you will not be accepting incoming connections. You should forward ports if you want to really help out the network. That way you'll be helping spread new blocks/txs and not just accepting them and maintaining a copy of the blockchain.

You can't really require anything since bitcoin is so open. 
By running a full node, sure you could say you are strenghening the network in terms of having an extra copy of the chain out there and one more node. You could even edit the reference client somehow and start running a node incompatible with every one else's while trying to convince people yours is better. Once most people agree with you and run software that's compatible with yours, you are the new "right" type. 
Anyway, but just letting someone else host the blockchain for you, you're basically voting that you trust them. 
One more option is running a full node yourself, and then using lite clients that you can configure to only access your node. 
So much for being informative. That just turned into a ramble.

There's a chain of bundles of transactions (blocks) called the blockchain. What miners are doing is taking these things
* hash of previous block
* a bunch of pending transactions
* nonce (quick way to change the contents of the block so the resulting hash changes)
and hash them together as fast as they can. They are hoping to get a resulting hash that is greater than the current difficulty. When they do,  they send out the block to the rest of the network and collect the block reward (currently 25 BTC + tx fees).
Now, if you want to mine in order to get free money, you're not going to make anything. Hardware costs too much and the difficulty is too high since so many other people with so much hardware are already hashing away. Think of it as the lottery only your chances of winning are astronomically small. (even if you join a pool [team], you're not going to make much per month. Probably can't cover electricity).

Not important to you. But helpful to the network. At the very least there's another (hopefully good) copy of the blockchain out there. Makes bitcoin that much harder to squash. At the very most, you've got ports forwarded correctly in your router and you're actually relaying transactions and blocks so you are speeding up the network.

I think the second type is possible, but most people would not get on board with it. It goes against some of bitcoin's core .... beliefs (not the right word, but whatever). 
So if the latest version changes the block reward to be 1 BTC for ever, most people would not download it and run it, thereby maintaining a network of the old version that does not follow the newest node's rules. 
In fact, you can fork the code RIGHT NOW and try to do something like that. All you gotta do is convince most people your idea is better and BAM you've changed the fundamentals of bitcoin.
Basically b/c people are more likely to get on board with making bitcoin more divisible.

1 - 4 sounds good. 
As far as change addresses go, just make sure when you (read: he) spends them, you import the address into a desktop client or something, then spend what you want, then send the remaining money to a new wallet. What most people get tripped up on is skipping the last step. Most wallets send the remaining coins to a different address automatically to help privacy. This is not what you want with paper wallets, so you need to make sure you either 1. force the client to send change to a paper wallet or 2. just do so in a second transaction. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:26:58
mining doesn't stop when all coins have been generated. 
block rewards are made up of new coins + transaction fees.
mining will continue.
difficulty is constantly readjusted based on network hashrate such that a new block is found every ~10 minutes. It has nothing to do with how many coins have yet to be mined.

You're holding a copy of the blockchain, which is nice. But you're not helping the network out by relaying information unless you've got ports forwarded correctly (therefore allowing incoming connections). So forward those ports if you wanna help!

New addresses don't have to be "validated" with the network. The key space is so large that when you generate a new address, you just assume no one has generated it before you. 
When receiving money, wallets do a quick check to make sure the address is valid. If it is, the money is sent. There's no check to see if it has received money before or anything. Just that it is a valid address.
So your coins will be safe and fine. When you go to spend them, import the entire wallet and send the change to a new one. REMEMBER THIS

In what circumstance? A terrible bug is found in bitcoin that isn't present in another coin? Sure I see your point there, but the exchange rate between the two coins would punish all but the first few people in (holders of the go-to coin wouldn't have much incentive for accepting bitcoin if bitcoin is failing). I think if that happened, it is more likely that we will try to reset to a good block or hopefully manage to handle it like we did a few months ago with the fork.

You can make as many new addresses as you want, I just don't think they are determinalistic. If they were, you would just have to backup the phrase that started the chain of addresses. Instead, it just randomly generates them like bitcoin-qt.
You definitely CAN make new addresses for every single transaction. They just aren't derived from each other. IDK how many you are given to start with multibit. I think just one (not like 100 hidden ones like bitcoin-qt), but to be honest IDK. If you're worried, hit the "new address" button a bunch of times before backing up.

Like I said, I can't help much with the specifics on electrum, but here's what I'd change about your plan.
Download electrum now. Don't download it while in the live environment. After booting up to the live environment, you could check that the md5/sha1 digest of the installer is the same as what the electrum people provide (if they provide one). 
I think a deterministic seed would only be better if you want to generate more than one address from the same seed. Otherwise you might as well take a long string of random woods and encode a private key from them. Just making sure, of course, that your string is long enough and not found somewhere on the internet/human knowledge already. 
Best of luck!

And I have to say, it's really cool. Today was the first day I hooked it up to my TV (no moniter that's &gt;= 720p) so I could see what it was like outside of headless mode. I've printed around 20 wallets so far and have started stowing them away for safe keeping. I love it!
As well as personal use, I can see businesses using these as a way to safely generate a new key for payment for each customer. They can even print off two copies is they press and hold the button. Then, at the end of the day they just import all the private keys and do what they want with the money. The code is completely open, so they could even edit the wallets to include their logo, create a customer copy, etc.

Right now there's a max of about 7 transactions a sec. Which, doing the math with a 1 MB max block size is 56 GB a year. The 7 transactions a second is a problem that some people in the community are working on solving right now, as we need more than that if we are going to get much bigger.
For your side question, there are many clients that don't require the entire blockchain to be downloaded. See multibit and electrum for two quick examples. In addition, it is possible to define a checkpoint at a certain block number and have everyone on the network agree that everything prior is good. Some altcoins do this. But as far as I know, bitcoin hasn't included that or done it.

Also, since it is kind of required to mention every time brainwallets come up: **don't use them. If you really want to, don't keep serious coin in one. When easy to remember, they are not safe at all. When they are hard to remember, they are no safer than an address made a normal way.**

he created this idea that could become a currency. And it did. He didn't just mine them and tell people to pay x dollars for them. His idea was good and that's why people are willing to pay good money for them now. In the beginning, yea they were basically worthless.

Yes. BTC/USD shows a steady upward trend and has recovered from each mini crash. Just do it now.
Don't buy more than you're willing to lose.
That's it.

Most merchants that accept bitcoin currently convert it to USD right after receiving it to protect themselves from price swings. Also, if they want $40 for something, they pull the price from an exchange and do ($40 / currentExchangeRate) to get price in bitcoins. 
Hopefully in a few years the price stabalizes and merchants can price in bitcoin and not have to worry about it changing overnight. I predict at least 5 years until that happens. But it is anyone's guess.

People bash it as a scam because of the insane was 98% of the coins were mined in the first 6 months.

* still isn't fast enough for fast food
* is 4x less secure since is it 4x as easy to find a block. Want the same security as 6 bitcoin blocks (for example)? Then you need ~1 hr on both networks. [citation needed], yes. I wish I had the math handy. I will search.

At one point it would only watch outside bitcoin subreddits if you donated to the bot. Then it would watch your personal comments too so you could tip anywhere. Once reddit added the username mention feature, however, the bot now works sitewide as it can just watch for username mentions

What said, also there's talk of building a system where people can get together and say they all need to send money at the same time, and instead of all sending a tx on their own,  they combine their inputs and send the desired amount to the needed outputs.

Thanks for the math.
Like you said: cost of attack. Probably much cheaper with litecoin for now. I mined on testnet with my graphics card, and while I *was* finding a block every minute or so, I wasn't the only one. If litecoin was testnet, it would be trivial for me to round up 100 GPUs and control the network. While some people have concerns about bitcoin's security if large entities own lots of hashing power, if there's enough large and honest entities with lots of power, they are the very thing that makes it expensive for a bad guy.

It is experiencing massive growth nonetheless. And if people that already have coins keep trying to convince new people that it is the safest investment in the world with untold fortunes awaiting everybody who gets on board, then the new people are sorely going to be burned with things head down price-wise. 
Hey, I want bitcoin to succeed as much as the next person, but lets not kid ourselves about how safe and right we are just so we feel better about how much money we have in this new thing.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:50:08
Probably not. But it wouldn't be that hard to print a paper wallet from  and sent the money from coinbase to the paper wallet either. That would be the best way to go.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:49:12
~1:10 talking about how it will continue to grow exponentially:
it can't in its current form. We are limited at about 7 trans a second to fit into 1 MB blocks every 10 minutes. 6 blocks an hour * 24 hours a day * 365 days a year = 52 GB of growth a year. 
The block size limit and scalability is currently being worked on by the developers. [And just today some researcher/scholar announced *his* idea for a better design that would allow 1 second blocks, 200 trans per second, and a blockchain that was not any less secure.]( 
@_date: 2013-08-31 00:59:51
Yes. Now, there will only ever be slightly less than 21 million coins mined, but once the last fraction of a coin is awarded, all the miner's rewards will come from transaction fees. Miners will keep on keeping on.

Individuals on Localbitcoins.com. just know you'll pay apremium  for using PayPal since PayPal always sides with the buyer when bitcoins are involved and it isn't hard to scam sellers

They're basically plug and play. You just need to download mining software (cgminer seems to be the most popular) and the USB miners should be recognized just fine.
I know you know this, but yeah. You're almost surely not going to make your money back. It still might be fun though. Have at it!
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:21:38
Yea. Um... I think 4 draw too much power or something. I think most people limit it to three per hub. Do some research on that first. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:48:17
You can miss an update and be fine. In fact, some people are running pretty old versions on their nodes right now.
The only thing you might want to watch out for is a hard fork where old coins become useless unless you send them to a new address version (say, for example, bitcoin changes from SHA-256 to SHA-512 b/c 256 has been found insecure). More than likely you'd have a big window to make the conversion. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:02:36
Interesting. Following that to its obvious conclusion, then bitcoin is grossly overvalued. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:17:09
You also need to worry about keyloggers. So basically the computer you use is also a POF. 
In addition, keep in mind that bitcoin-qt keeps a bank of 100 unused addresses that it doesn't show you. So after awhile, you back ups are potentially bad as the client has used up 100+ addresses and the backup only has the first 100. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:03:18
If you subscribe to the notion that bitcoin will either be awesome and mainstream or worthless, then you're still an early adopter. It could be $100K, $1M, $1B per coin. $200 is a bargin. Or it could all go to shit. I still think the chances are 50/50 at best of it going big. So $200/btc turning into just $1000/btc is amazing return.
 
 
 
 Just don't obviously invest more than you can lose.

If you keep them offline, you either have to import them into an online wallet, spend some, then send them back offline, OR use a client that lets you build a transaction offline, put it on a flash drive, move the flash drive to an online computer, and then broadcast the transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:19:03
With bitcoin, we may not see long term loans as, yes, the amount due will be worth more than the principal even with 0% interest. It is an interesting situation that doesn't fit into the current macroeconomic model. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 01:47:05
1) Unless you get the more expensive model and connect it to the internet, it is completely offline; therefore, there is no threat of attack from someone who is monitoring your internet traffic.
2) Everything is local. If you have a wifi printer, there's the threat that someone is watching that wireless traffic. 
3) I'm not well-versed on this point, but I have heard that some normal inkjet/toner printers keep an image of every page they print. This is a termal printer, and I **think** it is impossible for it to do that.
4) If you are worried about the creator leaving a backdoor somehow (machine using determinalistic keys, he's able to watch you once you've connected to internet, printer is malicious, etc, etc), the code is open source. You can look at it as much as you want. *Disclaimer: Creator says he posted it on github. I haven't actually gone to find it and look at it*
5) Customizable. You can edit the code to include a company logo. You can change what a button press does so it always prints off a store/customer copy. The possibilities are endless.

There's an extra (hopefully honest) copy of the blockchain out there. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:44:46
Very unlikely, but I guess possible if you pay with something other than BTC. Spend lots of times with mining profitability calculators and trust only the predictions that give you the worst profit. Difficulty is going up very fast right now, and it is generally believed to be better to just buy and hold BTC as opposed to mining.
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:23:18
It encrypts your wallet.dat so you need a password before you can spend your coins. Inside the wallet.dat is a list of all your private keys, basically. And ~100 private keys your wallet hasn't used yet.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:49:58
I think you are being too picky, unless you have vast amounts of wealth to store and you want it in an online wallet.

Well, I haven't used electrum specifically, but it would be really dumb it you had to be online. So I'm almost positive the answer is no.


Since you're being very paranoid in this scenario, I would say that you are potentially exposed too much already. You can download vanitygen (program) or bitaddress.org (webpage) to a USB drive or something, verify the code is not holey, and generate from there. Of course you're still downloading something at some point and trusting it, so.... yea.
I think a justifiable balance between security and practicality is met when you run linux (live CD or otherwise), disconnected from the interweb for the time being, and use a local copy of  or vanitygen. 
I haven't used electrum, so can't comment on its security and such. Let me know if I was too confusing and need to explain better.

Same place as a small fee: the miner/pool that mined the block that includes your transaction.

Not all altcoins are scams. Some actually try to solve a problem.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:08:40
think of bitcoins as euros and the money in your pocket as USD. Those websites are exchanges, much like real-world ones, that do USD -&gt; euro that exchange USD -&gt; BTC, euro -&gt; BTC, GBP -&gt; BTC, etc.
When you trade, you are buying/selling the bitcoin you deposited into the account at that site with someone else.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:46:19
(If you're talking about a cold wallet like  then it only has one address by definition because "wallet" is a misnomer in the term "paper wallets")
Otherwise, yes. From your cold wallet in armory you can build a transaction that sends xx BTC to an address in a hot wallet you own and yy BTC back to the cold wallet. xx + yy = zz, the balance in that single address. But since it is cold, by definition you obviously have to move that transaction to an online computer and broadcast it. But you probably knew that.

You need a board to put them on such as the Klondike K16 (cant link, on mobile. But it is being developed over on bitcointalk). I would find a group buy that offers assembly. Shameless plug: I have around 50 chips in steamboat's fifth batch I would be willing to sell.
