But they can't shut down Bitcoin

The report has this line. Is it what you were looking for?
"Millennials picked cryptocurrencies as their top long-term investment about 9 per cent of the time – about triple the rate of earlier generations."

It sure is. I wonder who would be the next to talk about it. Putin?
@_date: 2019-07-23 06:49:07
Obviously a buy signal
@_date: 2019-07-08 09:13:01
Put the domain here. People of Reddit are also buyers
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:53:03
USD of course. But Bitcoin hasn't done bad in ten years.
@_date: 2019-07-13 06:16:26
Everyone is stacking ��
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:34:50
Exactly. Why spend something that can increase in value when you can easily spend something that decreases in value yearly.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:02:50
Absolutely no way. This recent movement definitely has a trace of manipulation.
@_date: 2019-03-16 19:46:27
Gradually, We're coming!
@_date: 2019-03-16 19:46:51
Excellent reply
@_date: 2019-08-16 14:40:14
It will soon be enough
@_date: 2019-08-16 14:41:52
Who wants 1-2% when Bitcoin is busy doing higher yearly lows?
@_date: 2019-08-19 17:35:59
Nice logic. 
ICE Boss specifically mentioned that they bought the dip too, so it's very likely that happpened
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:12:24
Surely a win win
@_date: 2019-08-19 17:36:18
We need new entrants!
@_date: 2019-08-24 04:13:05
You're right.��
@_date: 2019-08-20 21:25:25
@_date: 2019-08-20 21:25:48
Hahaha brilliant Idea I'd say
@_date: 2019-08-19 17:36:30
You mean 99%
@_date: 2019-08-19 17:35:14
You got it right
@_date: 2019-08-24 04:11:57
That looks fair given this tweet also purportedly copied another person who posted two days earlier without credit.��
So instead of referencing two random sources that didn't verify the information, I used a neutral link. Fair enough
@_date: 2019-08-24 13:34:24
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2019-08-16 14:40:01
I don't want to believe Armstrong is lying this time. He said they started buying recently.
And Coinbase spending $55 million to acquire Xapo, tells you something is cooking
@_date: 2019-06-10 06:24:52
There are scammers every where eventually.
@_date: 2019-08-20 21:27:06
Give him a medal for filing in that position
@_date: 2019-06-18 06:48:42
After FOMOing in, then they lose money in the short term and come back to say Bitcoin is not a good investment ��
@_date: 2019-06-10 06:21:54
It's a scam. Run for your life
@_date: 2019-06-18 06:52:04
Yes. Start with a law firm would be best. I wish you success on your way to driving Bitcoin adoption.

McAfee's statement looks like it has no substance but still looks like it has substance. Am I the only person that sees it this way?
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:55:20
You're absolutely right! It will happen.
@_date: 2019-06-03 08:01:01
It will eventually happen, maybe not immediately but it will happen. Let's go to the moon!
@_date: 2019-01-25 19:12:06
Obviously. Very poorly researched
@_date: 2019-01-25 19:10:58
Yeah I guess.
@_date: 2019-09-10 07:13:40
I don't think it will end GBTC.
GBTC can claim the position Bitcoin claimed in the crypto space since it was the first such product to go live.
Besides, I don't expect an ETF to take off immediately. Could take some time too
@_date: 2019-09-10 18:16:13
Imagine if it doesn't come in 38 days and comes near the halving
@_date: 2019-09-12 23:31:09
Sportsbet.io and interested companies.
Read it's crowdfunded
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:27:19
It's soaring higher!
