Naturally there's a big liability for the gateway here, if the buyer isn't satisfied they get hit by the chargeback, not the vendor. There's several ways to compensate, for starters, higher fees. But also don't make vendor funds available for a sufficient length of time e.g 3 weeks, like eBay. For more reliable vendors this can be reduced.

darksend transactions don't go through a single node like dark wallet, so no they cannot :)
i hearken back to the tor analogy.  tor obfuscates traffic by entering several various nodes, the only surety being the exit node and entry node.
now you may suggest this is the same for darksend and that one need only look at the transaction values and deduce which transactions belong to whom.  but darksend requires input values that don't necessarily correspond to the amount being transacted (it is later reimbursed).  thus it is difficult to even determine the entry and exit nodes.

This is good and the logical progression of such a system may be something like the Nash exchange equilibrium: 
In short, all transactions require "burn" stakes from both the buyers and sellers.  If there is a dispute between the buyer and seller which cannot be resolved, the burn stakes are burned, irrevocably destroying the coins - which act as a donation to the rest of the network.
Nevertheless, what OP is describing may still be utile, in the sense of an insurance policy and credit line.

gold isn't a deflationary anything.  gold's purchase power has hardly moved in 200 years, and while there are probably greater vicissitudes over the course of human history (if we can even compare post industrial nations to mercantilists) that doesn't make for a good speculation, investment or currency.
the ideal currency would be inflationary in bust, deflationary in boom and set inbetween.  Bitcoin as a technology will give governments the tools to create sub-zero interest rates, which will put us closer to the ideal.  Of course it doesn't solve the prickly problem of anticipating the business cycle (it's debatable whether the stockmarket really does lead the business cycle).

coinjoin is to darksend what VPN is to TOR
not coincidentally coinjoin is modelled after tor.  unlike darksend there is little incentive to set up a legitimate mixing node.  conversely, darksend nodes are rewarded by the block.
now you can make that same criticism about TOR.  amusingly, perhaps not surprisingly, TOR nodes are primarily controlled by the US Government.  but TOR per se circumvents that apparent obstacle by reconnecting through sundry nodes, to the point that it becomes impossible to track even while controlling 50% of the network. Coinjoin simply can't do that because it lacks the network strength.  darkcoin has an innate infrastructure designed to both encourage the maintenance of nodes and the intention to continue developments coinjoin cannot e.g. IP obfuscation and on and on.
not to mention the inherent advantage of p2p mixing over centrally coordinated analogues.

You said it best here, mate.  The reality, though, is that it isn't a matter of just one or two influential politicians becoming martyrs - it's a matter of martyring the entire system and it's profligates.  The only way we'll see the branches of government with the necessary authority to act on the best interest of the people is by attaching that best interest to the pursuit of power which these branches operate under above all else.
Notice I didn't say the will of the people or the pursuit of profit.  The will of the people is liable to inclination and manipulation - so before we align the pursuit of power to the will of the people we must align the will of the people to their own best interest (via education and transparency).  And of course, most politicians don't do it for the money, so merely creating financial incentive is not enough.  Many politicians do start out with good intentions and would be far better off financially by joining the public sector, but for whatever reason choose to hold onto their power and hurt others - ostensibly for a greater good.
Alternatively, we could attach the pursuit of power to powerful metrics like global competitiveness, poverty, wealth disparity, health and education.  But those too are vulnerable to manipulation.  Even deferring their establishment to trusted third parties is not without its disadvantages, for one that would be a forfeiture of our sovereignty.  Perhaps a combination of these methods would be more suitable, but what is clear is that the current system, which supports what is essentially legal bribery in the form of lobbying and campaign contribution, is not working and must be revised.  
Getting the word out about campaign finance should be the  priority of any disillusioned voter, not parroting some 'pundit', not trying to get your guy elected, not voting on wedge issues, and surely not imagining one guy can go on national television and get the ball rolling, as sweet a dream as that may be.  Why aren't I doing more about this?  Well my friend, I don't vote.  To put it in better words than my own:
*The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.*

This is patently wrong.  The amount of risk you take in investment should be proportional to the research and due diligence you have taken.  That goes for the 80 year old widow and the 20 year old out of college.  Go on and get some real advice.  If you must speculate, then do it with a modest percentage of your investment capital, 10% at most.  If a speculation goes well immediately redistribute profits to other investments such that your speculations never make up more than 5-10% of your portfolio.

I'm not sure this was your intention but this is actually my point.  Deflation-prone currency discourages spending which discourages production.  There's a lot of reasons why we want our society's economic systems to encourage production over status quo but I understand that's also a philosophical matter.

@_date: 2013-11-29 22:15:56
the dubstep
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:16:52
1) as far as the multiplier effect is concerned it doesn't matter who earned what - all that matters is % consumption of the marginal dollar and its turnover.  poor people need to spend the marginal dollar more than the wealthy. poor people are a better fiscal multiplier investment.  welfare spurs economic activity more than tax breaks.
2) that last moody's study on the subject, supported by the CBO  
  
  
3) production of anything consumers are willing to buy.  i think we are confusing wealth with production.  wealth condensation is a real problem in capitalistic societies and poses an obstacle to competition, innovation and free markets.  the deflation-prone nature of bitcoin will result in wealth condensation - in fact it already does.
4) sure, let's consider a different approach.  forget deflation and inflation.  what would happen if everyone, opposite of now, saved as much wealth as they could, only spending what was necessary for food, shelter and clothing.  the fiscal multiplier would drop to near 0.  there would be no incentive to produce anything beyond necessities and business opportunities would be non-existant.  our society would become agrestic. 
now how do inflation and deflation factor in?  inflation encourages spending because holding money is a guaranteed loss in purchase power - deflation encourages hoarding because money will only appreciate in value.  ultimately whether you hold BTC or gold or whatever is a function of its appreciation in value compared to investment opportunities.    
the problem with deflationary currency is that it necessitates investment opportunities to be that much more lucrative, by out pacing deflation, to attract anyone.  because inflationary currency encourages spending it encourages investment and as a result encourages more risk-taking, innovation, competition and all the things that make free markets great.

Say you want to buy a cool set of crayons from Amazon and they cost $20.  If BTC = $1, then you need to pay 20 BTC.  If later you decide you don't like the crayons you can return them to Amazon for the equivalent of $20 in BTC, whatever that is.  So, if BTC went up to $2, you'd receive 10 BTC back.  Alternatively you could receive store credit.

As far as I know there are service providers that do exactly that for a nominal fee.  [BitPay]( is one.  Of course if you're a large enough business, designing your own processor may make financial sense.  
That said, the processing fee for immediate exchange will be the same as the exchange fee which is typically a fraction of a percent.  Or in the case of BitPay, not much more than the exchange fee.  Conversely, credit cards charge up to 4% and [paypal isn't much better](

My terminology may be wrong but when I was referring to the laborer class I meant those who relied upon labor as their main means of production and therefore wealth.  Then, when I said Capitalist I meant someone who relied on capital (money) as their main means of production and wealth.


Sure, but if these things don't exist how do we encourage innovation and production substantial enough to meet demand?


Indeed, the key word is hold.  The system is definitely rigged to discourage holding money.  But I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing, for the reasons mentioned - it's an extremely effective way of encouraging production.  If we want to discuss the philosophical merit of incentivizing constant production that's no doubt an interesting topic but it may be beyond our scope, at the moment.  It is suffice to say society, or the powers the be, have established a system that rewards production first and foremost.  Inadvertently, however, it also rewards those with great means of production, notably capitalists and their capital.

* This is 100% right.  The point of those CBO studies on allocation of government revenue is determining what method of allocation is most efficient in getting those resources to productive *domestic* hands.  And counter to we may expect, it's more efficient to build roads and support the unemployed than it is to give tax breaks to the wealthy.  See the link in the comment above if you haven't - it's skimmable.
  
* We're talking purely domestically, of course, what that study determined is that more dollars left the domestic economy in the case of tax breaks than unemployment benefits or infrastructure spending.  That money went to foreign economies or off shore financial havens.  In the case of the Bush tax cuts 71 cents on the dollar was leaving the domestic economy while in the case of food stamps 1.73 dollars were being generated for each marginal dollar spent.  Naturally of course you can't give away food stamps until the economy is better.  These things have diminishing returns and in the case of tax cuts the return is severely diminished such that it causes wealth to leave the economy.  It's a good reason to hike taxes up, actually.






* My question, then, is what would you invest in?  If everyone is only purchasing the necessities - what opportunities exist?  Hoarding is the only opportunity that exists.  And in the case of deflationary currency - why buy something when it will be cheaper tomorrow?  






* I think what we're neglecting here is the third scenario of money shortage.  If demand increases and supply increases but the money supply doesn't - you will experience deflation.  That is what I'm referring to.  Certainly deflation can occur as a function of gross production and gross demand but that is not what I mean.  I did suggest deflation can discourage production but that is an outcome not a cause.


* Inflationary currency doesn't necessitate fiat or central authority.  There very well could be an inflationary crypto, and I suspect there will be.

I am under the assumption that customer support is a fungible asset because it is a function of revenue which is itself a fungible asset.  Ergo, the more business you're accepting, the more resources will be available for business operations including customer support.
Now what I think you're suggesting, and I may be wrong, is that adopting bitcoin payments will in the short term be a proportionately greater drain on customer support than traditional payment options.  I'm not sure what that's based on but let's assume that's true - would the financial benefits, which have been explained previously, offset this drain on custom support?  I can't know for sure but let's take a step back and recognize this objection is a speculation on speculations.  This won't be a problem if POE has a properly staffed customer support department, any non-significant gains in revenue or payment problems actually fall under the jurisdiction of BitPay and its dedicated staff, which they usually will.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:32:33
I may be wrong but I don't believe Path of Exile pricing changes according to which payment method you use.  Further, POE supports Paypal and PaySafe as well as Steam and normal credit cards so if processing fees did affect pricing then Bitcoin would be the cheapest and therefore most beneficial to both POE and customers.

That's also why I think an inflationary crypto has major potential.  Crypto is the future, regardless.  :)


I don't necessarily disagree but can you explain what defines the means of society?  Is debt the definition of means?  I should think debt, much like savings, is a useful economic tool.  Debt creates opportunities where there otherwise would not be any and, admittedly, liability too.   Savings can inhibit wage slavery as well as promote class movement from the laborer to the capitalist.


Weimar might be pre-Keynes but it's a solid point nonetheless.  It is a silent tax - on lenders and, assuming productivity, it is a subsidy to debtors.  I'll confess to you what I don't like about our existing system.  It is too favorable to lenders while undermining non-debtor laborers.  I'm not sure gold or Bitcoin would change that, however.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:43:08
sure, in the short term we can attribute the current deflation to awareness and subsequent demand outpacing supply but ultimately we're dealing with finite numbers in the near future.  assuming wide adoption, BTC will be deflation-prone.

Here I was only referring to deflating currency in general but I will try to explain why I think BTC will deflate.  
There's 2 reasons: (1) Because there is a finite supply and (2) artificial scarcity will cause periods of deflation when growing demand out paces growing supply, as we are experiencing now.  During periods of deflation we will suffer from the same problems that our institutions used to justify leaving the gold standard - some of which I've mentioned above but many of which I haven't.    
Whether we were right or wrong to leave the GS is another (interesting) discussion but beyond our scope here.  The justifications for leaving the gold standard, however, were all logical.  The problem with fiat has always been corrupt actors not theory.  If you disagree here then we have a fundamental disagreement and we can end the discussion.




Sure but this goes back to the hypothetical situation where everyone acts in their self interest and uses BTC only on necessities.  I can't speak from experience but my father grew up in post-WW2 Europe where nations did experience deflation.  It's nothing to trivialize, it is not beneficial to economies.  I suspect our conversation is becoming recursive now.
So far I've enjoyed discussing these matters with you, bettercoin, but I hope if you take anything away it is these 2 short sections from wikipedia:

Hey OP, don't fall into the panic sell trap.  Bitcoin is in a bubble right now - and it will be again - but at the end of this it'll still be trending up.  Hang on to your coins even if they lose 50% of their value tomorrow.  Future you will be glad you did.

The only people who make significant money off bitcoin are the ones who hold coins and forget about them.  Keep that in mind.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:38:00


  
Hoarding exists even in fiat money.  For example, take welfare versus tax breaks.  The latter are considered a less efficient allocation of potential government revenue because those who receive the most significant portion of tax breaks are the least likely to spend them on necessities.  Welfare on the otherhand results in compulsory spending and an increased financial multiplier effect.  The financial multiplier effect is important in encourage economic activity and growth.


I get what you are trying to say but the reality is there hasn't been a greater wealth appreciation in recent history than BTC.  Further, set it and forget it investing like PM and bitcoin is attractive for reasons beyond marginal capital return.


It's bad because it discourages economic activity.  Of course it also depends on your aim.  The current centrall controlled fiat currencies use inflation to encourage spending and therefore encourage production.  If you can hoard bitcoins it does discourage spending but what's bad about that is that it discourages the application of capital to production.  If someone locks all their money up into gold or bitcoin that doesn't take it out of the economy - it transfers those resources to someone else who may or may not spend it.  If bitcoin supplanted fiat currency then it WOULD take it out of the economy - and that's the crux of the problem.
@_date: 2013-12-29 00:17:51
I believe there is an associated cost to accepting payments through paypal, credit cards, and Steam.  The merit of accepting bitcoin, then, is that it costs less to accept than the alternatives.  Also, you are presumably increasing the market of potential consumers, as some nations don't have the financial infrastructure to make buying things online convenient.
