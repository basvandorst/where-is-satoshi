The main problem with Truecrypt is that like any unmaintained security project is not going to receive updates for *when* issues are found.
That in itself is unsafe.
Furthermore, there are already a few vulnerabilities in 7.1a which I'd consider fairly severe.
[CVE-2015-7358 allows for privilege escalation, which admittedly doesn't directly affect security of decrypting containers](

In this thread: "What are spread and bid depth?"
Just because someone SOLD 0.001 BTC for $580.31 doesn't mean you can buy 1 BTC for $580.31.
Also, coinbase itself (not GDAX) is a brokerage, they update their buy/sell prices every minute(?) not using realtime pricing.

It's a bit disingenuous to imply that the *possibility* of a double spend is the same as a *realistic possibility*.
I have the *possibility* to mine 6 blocks in a row in less than a second on a Raspberry Pi. However, this is not a *realistic possibility*.
At the same time, BTCC has no *realistic expectation* they will mine 6 blocks in a row. Attempting this and failing will cost them greatly (Up to 5 block rewards + loss of trust in the community).

No they are not. For example you could have a Bank system similar to the current, but have the same signature system as bitcoin.

Most provably fair algos involve both parties deciding on secret values themselves.
* Before a hand starts, give the users the hash of your secret value.
* The user will pick their own value and send it to you to start a hand. (This prevents you from throwing out secrets which give you a disadvantage)
* You combine both secret values (Your prehashed value) to create the deck.
* After the hand is over you reveal your secret value which the user can use to recreate the deck and verify it matches the hash you sent in step 1.
You especially cannot use static values like the username.

Miners not having to pay fees means anyone who can mine a block can add an attack tx.
@_date: 2016-01-18 00:33:35
Further explanation as to why you would require another input: You can't determine which outputs are the payment itself and which are change.
So the only way to increase the fee would be adding more input value.

Don't forget, the fees are paid to the miners anyway. Why should they add a fee and pay themselves?
Furthermore, how long did they sit on the transactions waiting for one of their blocks to be mined? 
They could have paid a fee to another miner to get them in sooner, leaving empty space in their block to earn fees from **other** transactions, but why should they bother?
@_date: 2017-01-20 18:29:58
They would be risking those fees in event of their block being orphaned.  
Would be curious of the risk/reward calculations based on orphan rate and the the amount of fee raising possible.

@_date: 2017-01-21 01:03:12


Well, the higher block size *very very* minorly increases orphan chance, but that wasn't my point.




They have to broadcast their block when they mine it, which has all the transactions in it. Which would normally be fine, but if that block gets orphaned someone can take those transactions and use them in another block.
@_date: 2017-01-20 21:08:43
Because if they pay higher fees to themselves, they lose nothing. But if their block is orphaned someone else's block can include those valid transactions giving the *other block owner* the fees.

It's actually worse than that.
Electrum relies on asking servers about your balance, a server owner can therefore know that two keys are owned by the same person.

It's called a concept. Concepts can vary between people, but have a general definition. (Justice/Moral/Ethics/Culture/etc)
If you weren't aware spam email identification is as much of an art as a science. You have to use complicated assumptions as to whether the user wanted the email or not. Bitcoin TXs are the same. You can use various patterns to determine if you think a transaction is "Spam" by your own definition.
The most obvious ways you can see an example of a spam TX is a TX that sends it's entirely contents back to itself.
You can also do some overall statistical analysis to get a good idea of some spam stats based on fees/txouputs/address reuse/etc. See [this]( for a good example on analysis of a recent mempool backlog which correlated highly with a certain pattern.
But as I said before, this is as much art as science. Any of these methods will have tons of false positives. It's not something you can really enforce automatically without major consequences.
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:18:34
You could argue it's at least a *shadow of a doubt*.
@_date: 2016-12-03 00:59:10


It's sure as hell relevant. All spam lives *forever* in the blockchain. Knowing (somewhat) how much is fluff vs actual capacity is a highly relevant metric.


I agree entirely, like I said, it's not something you can enforce*. That doesn't mean the concept doesn't exist.


It can still be spam. It's valid spam, but spam none the less. Spam isn't something that can be eradicated, it's a per person wishywashy definition. My spam is someone else's important messages. But as a network overall there are some TXs which most can agree on are useless spam if given entire context. The problem is the context is murky and not easily ascertained.
* Individual miners can and do enforce their own deprioritization of their own definition of spam which is a net positive for the network. As it will reduce confirmation times for more normal transactions.

Does it actually query for known used addresses? Otherwise the odds of randomly picking *used* addresses to mask is quite low.

They can simply mine as small of a block they want. This is not for a MINIMUM but a MAXIMUM. 
There are still "empty" blocks mined now.

Couldn't the pool just stop counting the proof blocks using outdated templates? (With a realistic threshold, of say 2 previous updates)
When the miners stop getting their (outdated) work counted, they'll fix their software.

While I agree that segwit is a better option than mindlessly increasing blocksize, this isn't a needlessly complex change by BU. It's about the only viable method  for fixing the issue when increasing the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-04-01 00:07:18
Let's not shit on BU for one of their saner choices. There's plenty of other issues we can focus on that don't make us look petty.
This is one of the simpler and more effective ways to prevent the quadratic hash problem. If they didn't add this they would get shit on for not adding a fix.
@_date: 2017-04-01 09:13:51


It's the only viable solution to fixing the quadratic problem *when increasing blocksize*. And by blocksize I mean specifically the 1MB hard limit, which segwit doesn't change.
Even if segwit is activated, limiting (non-segwit) tx sizes would likely be necessary if the blocksize would ever be increased. Hopefully by that time L2 protocols are in place so that doesn't need to happen.

You also have to take into consideration if you can reverse the goods/services sent on your end.
For example, if you're selling a subscription service you can easily accept 0 confirmations and just end the service if the transaction fails.
If you're shipping a package tomorrow, "Accept" the 0 confirmation payment and start the process, but don't ship until it gets fully confirmed.
If you selling an irrevocable good, such as another crypto currency/in-person physical goods/money then waiting for confirmations is fairly necessary.

This may be useful in depth, but what you actually should do is limit ports 80/443 entirely except to cloudflare's IP ranges.
This will help against a good amount of layer4 attacks even with a leaked origin IP.
