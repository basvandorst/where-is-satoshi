you're not taking advantage of BTC, ETH and NEO's volatility doing it this way, though.
binance/gdax are likely as secure as your hardware, and allow you to sell on a whim when there's bad news; then you buy back when the rest of the spaghetti fingered folk are done with their panic...
20k btc you bought = 
sell at 19.5k during first dip
buy at 6k during last dip
you now have 3.25btc, worth over $35k from your 20k investment instead of a mere, halved, $10k 
"hodling" is an absolute joke, for any coin. sell high and buy the bloody dip. follow some TA nerds on twitter and get the basic understanding on how to read charts, so when they post in a panic about BTC aout to die, you can look out for that high.
i wish reddit would throw out this "hodl" meme. it's made by people who've done nothing but hold the one coin that's made it over $10k. we're not in 2017 now, you'll never see $1 btc again, and unless you're already rich there's no real money to be made in BTC. maybe there is in NEO, but doubtful it'll 100x. 10x is on the table, that's it.

... he said december, not red-january
he's talking about 20k bitcoin, not 6k bitcoin 
bitcoins fees were shite before segwitx2 due to the amount of traffic on the btc network. it shit the bed, and you couldn't move to exchanges *if* we had bad news in december.
you SHOULD have the ability to, and do, sell if your 20k BTC is about to go to $10k over night 
if you sold your BTC at, say, $19.5k (post-fees) and rebought at $6k... how many BTC do you have now? 3.25 BTC, you have 3.25BTC now! 
and when BTC reaches $20k again, your $20k original bitcoin is still worth $20k... on the other hand, your new 3.25BTC is worth $65k
OOOO HODL RIGHT?
(my point is: you're a doofus if you pour money into BTC and store it in a cold wallet, then expect it to make you rich. sell high, buy low, easy)

if you such donkey dick with trading, though, you can just "hodl"... but even my mum can do this crap, and she's no genius. she's already 20x her £10 investment. these "hodlers" are absolute nutters

"hodl" is a meme anyway if you're looking to make money.
even if btc hit 100k this year, that's less than 10x its current value. good luck buying a lambo if your investment is &lt; $10k.
good luck making a mint if your investment is less than $100k
good luck owning a bitcoin as a fresh-to-the-bitcoin-game non-rich kid, kiddles 
don't "hodl", keep it on an exchange and trade it. switch it around, come back to daddy bitcoin before a bull, switch it to fiat or usdt when there's a downtrend.
