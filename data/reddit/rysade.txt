When BTC was really picking up the number most media outlets quoted was usually 11 Million. I belive Liquid00 is attempting to debunk a media myth.

I agree with the sentiment, but this is not a very quotable line.

That explains why I didn't recognize it, haha!

Somebody want to translate this for me? Looks like JS but I don't know `assert`

Wow. Looks like logic goes unopposed again. GOD I get so tired of this. And to see it from the Bitcoin devs turns my stomach.

"Artificial General Intelligence?"      
Really?    
The fact that this is included should make this chart suspect. AGI is a meme.

Crazy that The Register used to have straight-to-the point content. What happened?

The terse answer is 'because the human brain exists.' Modeling AI on human intelligence just continues the present trend, it does not lead to a quantum leap forward.    
Also, we should probably get some terms nailed down if we want to really get into this. What I often hear people describe as AGI is something that will be indistinguishable from human intelligence, i.e. passes the Turing Test. However, some might mean that it causes the Singularity.

Not to mention, they can reverse transfers. The STATE gives you a lot more wiggle room if you can just undo whatever you did.
With Bitcoin - no such luxury.
