A chargeback CAN happen no matter what as long as the user has paid with a credit card, this is a fact.  
They may not be able to do a PAYPAL DISPUTE if they send via friends and family, but they CAN do a credit card chargeback and that's what sophisticated scammers do, it's very important to understand this.  A paypal dispute and a credit card chargeback are two totally different things.  Anybody that tells you differently has never run an e-commerce store or been victim of chargeback fraud.
They always have 6 months to do a credit card chargeback (visa, mastercard).  I strongly recommend that you don't ever sell bitcoins via Paypal to any strangers even if they show you a selfie with ID.
It's ultimately up to you but please keep this all in mind, good luck.

They would find your second Paypal account easily and freeze both of them if you left one in debt (debt from the chargebacks).
Even if you transfer the money into your own bank where Paypal can't touch it, you will still be liable for the debt in Paypal if any chargebacks come through.  They would send you legal threats if you didn't pay it and you could end up in court.
Your Paypal would also be banned for life (and any new accounts you ever create), your family would also be banned from Paypal.  They don't mess around.
The chargeback system sucks but it's necessary to protect buyers from scams and theft, sadly it's a system that's often abused by dishonest buyers.
In case you didn't know, if you receive a credit card chargeback and the sale was made via Paypal, they charge you an extra £14 per chargeback.
That means if somebody sends you ten small £0.50 payments and they do a credit card chargeback on all ten of those payments, you lose the £5 (£0.50 x 10) you received but you will also be charged an extra £140 (£14 x 10) in chargeback fees, giving you a total loss of £145.
