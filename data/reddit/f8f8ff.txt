Don't forget Vinny Lingham and Civic, staunch defender of the NYA agreement (cause "a deal's a deal") and ICO shitcoin connoisseur.

Vinny is a PoS and an asshole in person.  Typical "ICO VC" with half a brain hopping on the train cause crypto is cool and will make them money.  Not to mention Civic is an atrocity to privacy and he pre-sold a to a bunch of whales.

Keep crying about it, everyone had plenty of time.  "Responsible practices" is doublespeak for permission.  Distributed technologies are permissonless.  This isn't a CEH class and your idea of how things "should go" isn't how things need to go.   The irresponsible practices, if any, were not fixing issues in a timely manner and everyone defaulting to core over a healthy ecosystem of implementations.

Why would someone buy an account to argue about responsible disclosure?

rofl, pretty good interview.
You've got to understand, as a "business person" who's entirely non technical Vinny highly values his verbal and written commitments because deals **are what he sells**.  If his business connections don't believe he will honor his commitments he has **nothing** to rely on.
He is set in stone and this is why these management level business parasites are always so dense and predictable.

It was fake, he never knew what he was talking about, he just was able to parrot what he heard for a minute and sound like a good guy.
Go ahead and talk to him, you'll realize he's a clueless asshat in less time than it takes to finish your tea.
