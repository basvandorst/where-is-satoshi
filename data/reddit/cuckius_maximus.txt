Right now bitcoin is not far more convenient. Nor is it as convenient as a debit card.

The only time bitcoin would be more convenient for me would be sending money internationally to an individual(not a business, because they accept my card 99% of the time) I'm not sure why you mention going to an Atm to get cash... I haven't used cash in years because it's outdated. I can send money instantly to anybody in my country that has a phone number or email address. I can shop both online and at brick and mortar stores with ease. Bitcoin is less convenient for all of these scenarios. It's slower and not accepted anywhere that I would spend it. Converting some of my bitcoin to fiat that I could spend was either very slow or expensive.
I'm not saying that bitcoin has no future, or anything along those lines. but in its current form it has very little use for the average person. It needs to be improved first.

Nobody said anything bad about sports here they just alluded to the hypocrisy of the people shitting on people watching others play video games when plenty of them love watching others play sports.

I'm that guy. but I bought it in July and now I say "I knew it I am smart".
But really I didn't know shit I didn't even look at price history when I bought it I just liked the idea and got lucky that it was at ~1800.
