The main benefit from using OpenBazaar comes from its listing / search system. If you open up your shop at your computer without OpenBazaar, no one will find it. If you put it up using OpenBazaar, lots of people (currently thousands and increasing) can find it. OB is likely also easier to set up than setting up a shop without it.

I did this same mistake once with an even larger amount and I got my money back from BTCC. They handle stuff like this very well. Even though I was careless, I stopped using blockchain.info after that incident. Their UI for custom tx is just bad.

Henry from Denarium here. We specialize in physical coins and especially as gifts. We could easily do a Coin Box for you with a custom sticker. And the box can include any of our coins.
A fully custom coin would be expensive at the moment. We also do that, but the recommended minimum order is 1000+ coins or otherwise it will be costly. Just 1 would be very costly.
You can contact us at store and we can figure something out.

Indeed and that is what makes this whole thing so confusing. My own conclusion is that he may not be Satoshi himself (perhaps Kleiman was) and the part where he is Satoshi is actually faked BUT that he did actually work with Satoshi since the beginning and is a very relevant character.

Let me explain something. Core supporters have had this argument against forking for a long while now. It goes like this: if Bitcoin is forked without the support of Core, many Core developers will quit entirely. And we "can't afford to lose them".
This argument does have some merit in that it is not ideal to lose some of the most technically gifted people in the community. But I'm starting to form a position which states "don't let the door hit you on the way out".
The Bitcoin infighting has reached its peak and we need unity again. If Core is unwilling to compromise with the blocksize / hard forks and continues to sidestep it with plans for the long term future - while the issues that arise from blocks being more and more full are issues of the *now* - the road to unity will be a less peaceful one.
@_date: 2015-12-02 08:35:25
I highly disagree with the notion that we should set the blocksize based on the countries with lowest internet speeds. Doesn't make any sense.
We should look at the liberal countries primarily. There seems to be a connection there - the more liberal countries do have better internet speeds than non-liberal ones.
There are many things to consider here. For instance, a non-liberal country is much more likely to ban mining and running nodes entirely. In this case the potential users can likely circumvent this easier by using web services that are not full nodes.
Now I'm coming to my second point which is this notion of everyone needing to run a full node. No, not everyone needs to and *newsflash*, very large majority of users now do not run a full node.
We don't even need every country to run full nodes. It doesn't matter one bit for the safety of Bitcoin if users in some particular countries can't run a full node at all. What matters is that it can be run in the liberal countries where Bitcoin has by definition more protection anyway.
Edit: I fully understand any country can ban Bitcoin. Then run nodes elsewhere! All Bitcoin needs is some free countries that allow running nodes. We don't need *nodes* in every country, it is more viable to use Bitcoin in other ways in countries where running nodes is difficult. Limiting the capacity of Bitcoin because we need nodes to run everywhere is simply ridiculous.
@_date: 2015-12-02 11:51:31
I understand what you are getting at but it does not change my point. It is easier for any country to block nodes than it is for them to block using all other methods of using Bitcoin that do not rely on running a node in that particular country. All that is required for Bitcoin to work is that there remain some countries that are not banning it entirely. Companies can run their Bitcoin nodes in countries where it is viable and so on. The notion of limiting the capacity of Bitcoin because some countries have a crappy internet in one way or another is absolutely ridiculous.

Well, it is true that if they handle it badly there is an increased risk of holding funds at Coinbase in case a confusing fork happens. This pretty much goes below that category of multiple reasons of why you should not hold your funds there or at any other centralized/regulated entity.
I personally think the scenario of a persisting fork is highly unlikely though. There may temporarily be a situation such as you describe but it is very unlikely to last long. There would be a larger value difference soon as entity after entity switch to what they perceive to be the larger fork in terms of the Bitcoin economy in general.
Anything that the exchanges do now is not a good indicator of what they would do if there were a confusing fork. I think everybody would be wide awake and quickly implementing any changes necessarily to offer the smoothest customer experience possible.
Historically this has been true. In 2013 when the network forked for a couple of hours, it went surprisingly smoothly. Which adds confidence that a new fork would be fairly smooth. Although it's a bit different if the fork is due to a bug or if it is due to a political conflict, so we don't really have a 1:1 precedent.
In any event I believe that XT will not be widely implemented / going through without it already having widespread consensus. And this will only happen if the network continues to get more congested and no other practical (fully coded, tested, with a BIP) solutions truly emerge as something to implement instead.
Coinbase has clearly stated that they are open to other solutions. But they had a December deadline and BIP101 happens to be the most polished solution yet, which means that is what they use for now.

Well, for Denarium the primary focus was to do what Casascius no longer does. Although we have improved on the concept by providing easier redeemability and multisig. In regards to multisig we are coming up with some other new products soon.
In terms of usability of the coins for monitoring and aftermarket purposes we are also going to soon launch a Denarium explorer which allows tracking of the coin balances easily using only the serial numbers. This I think will be a major improvement as well.

There are good usecases for RBF but there are also very important usecases for relatively safe 0-conf transactions. I think that the opt-in model is actually pretty good. I don't think it makes sense for any wallets to make it a default. Also the idea of payment protocol requests automatically informing the wallet that "RBF not recommended" and then even if someone has RBF on the wallet could skip it is a great idea.
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:03:57
This is not a concern this time. It is clear that the guy wants attention now. This is not someone who is hiding on purpose any longer. So either he is the real Satoshi and wants to come out, or he is an attention whore who is simply claiming he is Satoshi.

"Again, I disagree. Brian's arbitrary "deadline" (again, is he Bitcoin's dictator?) was "second week of December" (aka Dec. 7 onwards). When is Scaling Bitcoin  The same time. In other words, Brian wants a decision made at a conference that explicitly forbids making a binding decision."
Brian or anyone else can make their own deadlines about this and any other issue. It doesn't make them a dictator, it makes them decisive. This is something I personally like and I very much dislike indecisiveness. This is *their* deadline, not yours, not mine, not anyone elses.
As has been greatly demonstrated by the XT project, anyone can and will and should if necessary, challenge who runs the Bitcoin project and how and why. Coinbase and other BIP101 supporters are doing just that.
The most important thing they are doing is putting pressure to force a decision. Either it is BIP101 or it is a compromise solution of some sort, but it is going to be something. And by doing what they do, it is quite likely that this something (whatever it is) will happen and it will happen fairly soon.
"2-4-8 / 3-6-9 (by Back)
BIP 100 / BIP 102 (by Garzik)
BIP 103 (by Wuille)
"BIP 103++" (by Garzik/Maxwell/et. al)
Flex-cap (by Friedenbach)
Extension blocks (by Maxwell)"
There is plenty of theory but very few of these solutions that you mention are even close to practical code solution. BIP100 and the improved versions of this have been the ones most in the spotlight after BIP101.
There has been quite a bit of debate regarding BIP100 and its derivatives and so far many BIP101 supporters have been a bit skeptical. But personally I'm not well aware of the improved derivatives and am very interested in the Garzik talk at Scaling Workshop. In fact it is the one I'm most interested in at the moment.
This doesn't counter my point in any way - there was debate regarding BIP101 vs BIP100, it started to go nowhere, now BIP100 is being improved. This is actually the way it should go and thus right now I don't see any serious other contenders to BIP101 other than the BIP100 derivatives. But maybe the workshop will surprise me, who knows...
Additionally Brian or others (like me) usually don't need to directly participate in the debates. We can simply click the upvote button for arguments that are similar to what we would say.

I agree that it is a nuclear option and an absolute last resort. But miners forcing their opinion on something that is not for them to choose alone would be a move which can not be tolerated.
The best outcome is for miners and exchanges and developers to agree on a compromise solution. Otherwise we will have different parties pushing their own solution and we will truly see who has the greatest power. And it could get ugly.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:47:30
BIP202 increases the blocksize automatically 1 MB per year. That *is* conservative and safe. Automated increase is very important so that we don't so easily run into this political deadlock again.

I agree with many of the points you raise but it's important to keep in mind that it is extremely hard and most likely pointless to try to change Bitcoin leadership if Core would now accept a compromise of 2-4-8 or 2 + 1 per year.
In some sense it could be best for Bitcoin long term if they do not compromise and a change in leadership becomes an inevitability. But we'll see. Something quite interesting I noticed today was news about the miner blockchain survey. BTCC with 15% hashrate is willing to run a fork if Core doesn't compromise soon.

Good post, thank you. I want to learn something about SW that I can't understand, and it has been said a couple of times.
"The incentive to upgrade is lower tx fees, and higher capacity for those who upgrade."
Why does it add capacity for "those who upgrade"? Are miners going to somehow prioritize SW transactions? This is something I don't currently get. My initial assumption on this was that it will increase capacity generally, based on how many upgrade.

I've had one theory for a while which is that Wright is not exactly Satoshi but was working with him (so perhaps Kleiman was Satoshi) and now it's made to look like it is actually him even though he doesn't have the keys. But hard to say. Some of the evidence must be true though, it's just hard to know at this stage which is and which isn't.

This tweet really hits home on a *key* issue. The question of Bitcoin being "settlement" or "payment" *is not* black &amp; white. 
Bitcoin main blockchain may eventually be better for settlement than payments but that is not actually the relevant point. The relevant point is that it is NOT up to the central planners of Bitcoin to decide what it is and what it isn't.
It is and is supposed to be and *will be* up to the market to decide what it is useful for and what it is not useful for. Artificially restricting Bitcoin to settlement purpose in a situation where such strict restriction is not actually necessary, is not just wrong, it's an attack on Bitcoin.
Fortunately an attack of this sort can and will be countered, *one way or another*.

I think your view is too optimistic. The two options (which are not the only ones btw, BIP101 is still on the table as are 2-4-8 and 2 + 1 MB per year) have 1 radical difference: the other is a soft fork and the other a hard fork. 
In addition the practical implementation of a blocksize increase, and the timing of having a complete &amp; tested implementation in the first place, is very different for SW and a blocksize increase.
The largest single issue is the soft fork vs hard fork. The Core developers seem to be very adamant about not doing a hard fork pretty much ever, unless there is a super critical problem that requires it.
The other camp though has no problem with hard forks and is probably even willing to try to aggressively sidestep  Core in case a blocksize increase is not enabled in time. And time is of the essence: is SW going to be implemented widespread in time? Possibly not. In that case blocksize increase may be the only option.
I personally hope achieving consensus and unity will be peaceful. There is still a chance. All it requires is for Core to modify their stance on blocksize increases and hard forks. If that doesn't change, there is a good chance for a non-peaceful transition.

Well, I have to rest my case here, as the arguments are completely beyond me. The fact that China has a lot of mining infrastructure is a fact but it is not a good thing nor is it something the community at large is supposed to protect or support in any way whatsoever.
Having difficulties running nodes in China would be their problem, not ours, and most importantly - they can still USE Bitcoin even if running full nodes inside the country is difficult. And it does NOT remove the monetary sovereignty in any way. Bitcoin ownership is protected by private keys - it is not needed for the actual node network to be run in each and every country where there is usage.

"My side", lol. That is silly. As a "big blocker" I've already made the huge compromise to start supporting BIP202 in addition to BIP101, even though I think BIP101 is conservative to begin with and BIP202 is extremely conservative. But I'm doing this because I want a peaceful transition.
The other "side", if I may borrow your terminology, seems to have extreme difficulty in coming up with compromises when it comes to any blocksize increase / hard forks. But I assure you a non-peaceful transition will come if there is no compromise capability from the "other side". This I'm more certain of, than anything.
@_date: 2015-12-29 02:33:12
The small blocker camps (B,C,D) are well defined, the big blocker camp (A) however is simplified to stupidity.
For example, the article does not focus at all on the  risk factor that big blockers want to avoid: the fact that when the blocks become constantly full of actual, legit, non-spam transactions, there is a large likelihood that the usability of Bitcoin significantly decreases. This is a very valid concern.
Also, most big blockers do not ignore the factors that other camps emphasize. Decentralization is a key property of the Bitcoin system but it is not the only property. Decentralization is irrelevant if nobody is using the system due to it becoming unusable.
Time is of the essence. Both SW and LN are unfinished solutions and the blocks are getting ever fuller. Also there has recently been increased critique to both SW and LN, making them not as clear cut solutions for all the problems as has been claimed.
Key points right now in the scaling discussion for me (and I lean to the "large blocker camp") are:
- The censorship (this is the  issue of all since discussing a compromise is well, impossible, if there is rampant censorship).
- Do we need full nodes &amp; mining to be possible in each and every country? This is a key issue. There is a lot of data that says BIP101 is completely safe in terms of being able to run a node, for certain parts of the world. For China, not so much, but do we want to limit Bitcoin's capacity based on the lowest denominator? I personally think not. By doing this we basically subsidize mining in China and significantly limit the capacity of the Bitcoin blockchain.
- Bitcoin Core &amp; XT and any other software forks can quite easily co-exist even in a blockchain hard fork situation. The rival software simply needs to enable the same hard fork patches to be compatible. So if XT, BU, or something else "wins" over Core, Core can simply enable the same hard fork patch and be compatible. Just like XT is currently merging soft fork updates that are initiated in Core.
- Personally I'm not super strongly for BIP101 and I don't think that most of the big blockers actually are. But the censorship is definitely making things much more difficult. I'm open to a compromise solution but if one is not allowed to freely discuss the issue, it is a problem, and will turn more big blockers to directly support BIP101.
- Garzik's BIP202 is a decent compromise. I wish there was more discussion about that proposal.

Yes, I think that the article by Jeff &amp; Gavin is a game-changer. Now may be the last chance for a peaceful compromise. If it doesn't happen, we will move into the "screw it" territory. Screw Core territory, to be more exact.
It's interesting to note that Mike Hearn was actually quite right about this whole process. He said that scaling conference  will lead to more stalling in regards to raising the blocksize and doing a hard fork. And guess what happened? Exactly that.

Replace-by-fee wouldn't help here as the fee of the original transaction is, well, high. :D
Well it would if everyone was using replace-by-fee but that's not the case.

I actually like SW, so don't get me wrong. The best thing about it is fixing malleability. And it's a nice plus that it enables more capacity with a certain blocksize.
There are however issues with SW that I'm concerned about and they are the following:
1) SW is still months away from being ready and it is quite possible this timeline will be delayed. SW is a complex change which requires a lot of testing and there may be delays.
2) SW's usefulness for capacity is directly linked to how much software is upgraded to SW compatability and how many users of said software upgrade to the version that supports SW. And SW is a huge change that requires every piece of software to be upgraded.
Meanwhile increasing the blocksize can quite reliably be done within a couple of months via a hard fork. Requires small amount of testing since the change is very simple. Not all software needs to be updated although full nodes have to upgrade. Increasing capacity via blocksize increase is easy, reliable, fool-proof. SW is anything but.
The key issue is that I'm not allergic to hard forks. I'm not in the XT camp, or BIP101 camp, or anything like that. More than anything these days, I'm in the "fork it hard" camp. I've grown extremely tired of the deliberate attempts of *doing everything possible* to avoid a hard fork. I see no problem with hard forks, they can be done smoothly and should be done.
Getting one hard fork in at this stage would be very good for future Bitcoin development. It would allow us to more easily get other hard forks in down the road. Doesn't mean most changes shouldn't be done via soft fork - they should - but hard fork is a great tool occasionally.
@_date: 2015-12-03 15:11:25
In this case there could be an algorithm switch, to such an algorithm the attacker's hardware can't efficiently hash. If the miners plan on going on strike or starting a war over a "non-preferential" blocksize increase, I guarantee you they will eventually lose.

Not that I support holding funds at Coinbase (I don't), this reason isn't one of the reasons why. First of all BIP101 will only be triggered with major mining consensus but that is not even relevant. Players like Coinbase will always be in the majority chain and BIP101 supporting client is technically *safer*. Also it is quite possible for anyone to configure nodes for each fork just in case (to broadcast each tx in both networks) in case there is any doubt. This is what any smart exchange will do if there is confusion.

I agree the modifications are suspicious, very suspicious. But this guy really seems to know his stuff (based on the conference panel), seems to be a very early adopter, is actually doing very high level Bitcoin / Blockchain stuff etc. His background in terms of computer science, economics ideology, fondness of Japanese culture, so many little things simply match here. 
Even with the so called modifications I feel there is a convincing case here. Although it's hard to say how much of Bitcoin was Kleiman and how much Wright, but anyway. It wasn't his project alone, this is already clear. Finally I'd just like to point out that Satoshi never signed anything with his PGP key, that isn't his style in general.

That is true but it all depends on how ugly it gets. Exchanges and users can also manually ignore the chain made by the "small blockers" and basically shut them out of the rest of the economy, in order to force a policy change.
BIP101 can be modified so that the clients ignore all chains that have only &lt;1MB blocks after a certain date. Or something. But what you're saying is true unless something like this is done.
This situation would be quite radical anyways. I'm fairly sure something is going to give somewhere before we have an "open war" between the exchanges, miners, devs etc... I'm simply thinking about the long term theoreticals here.
If the blocksize issue stalls long enough there is a high risk for radical events.
@_date: 2015-12-03 19:37:04
By being afraid of "an attack by the miners" you give them power in the process. No. The users can throw away the miners and replace them with other miners. Their role is to adapt to what the network rules are, not make them. 
They can influence the rules to an extent and especially rules that are primarily related to the mining process but the block size is something that affects everyone and is not technically nor in any other way up to them but up to all the users.

Large is relative. I have multiple wallets and the BC wallet wasn't one of the more secure ones. I'm completely aware of this. Thus I was also prepared to lose the 25. BC was used purely due to usability.

@_date: 2015-12-03 10:30:25
No. The miners do not choose which blocksize implementation is going to be used.
If users/exchanges want, they can force a fork to bip101 without majority of miners. Then it is very likely miners will follow. If they attack the network or blackmail, then there will be a change of algorithm. And there goes their entire business.
Unlikely scenario but it is very important miners are not given more power than they already have.

The miners will mine bitcoins that are useless. New miners will emerge to mine the blockchain that is supported by the users.
The only problem here is that this extreme scenario would leave the other blockchain potentially vulnerable to a 51% attack. 
But I think this scenario is purely theoretical - I can't see how *all* current miners would decide to stay on the fork that the users have abandonded. Wouldn't make sense.

I'm aware that any country can ban Bitcoin. And I'm not from the US by the way. It is easier for any country to block nodes than it is for them to block using all other methods of using Bitcoin that do not rely on running a node in that particular country. All that is required for Bitcoin to work is that there remain some countries that are not banning it entirely. Companies can run their Bitcoin nodes in countries where it is viable and so on. The notion of limiting the capacity of Bitcoin because some countries have a crappy internet in one way or another is absolutely ridiculous.

There is no one mining it yet since the miners seem to be quite conservative. Many are supporting BIP100 as well but they are not mining BIP100 blocks (well, there is no complete code for that yet either). The situation as of now does not mean anything yet.
All I personally care about is that the miners can not be the ones deciding which blocksize increase is going to be implemented. They can voice their opinion but the users at large need to decide which is the best for everyone. The miners simply need to *adapt*.
Nothing has been decided yet in terms of politics. It all comes down to the scaling conference and its aftermath. Either a new compromise solution emerges or certain parties are going to start pushing BIP101 more aggressively. Where it leads, nobody knows.
Personally I'm hoping for a compromise solution to emerge but if push comes to shove, I'm backing BIP101. But I'm completely open and interested in the alternative solutions, the only issue is that they need to emerge quickly.

I don't understand at all where the "Brian as a dictator" argument is coming from. A lot of people from the dev community, exchanges and now increasingly from miners as well are giving out their opinions on this issue. Brian has a right to do that too.
Exchange services targeting regular users and consumers are the ones most likely to push for a blocksize increase in the short term, that is for sure. Personally I think it was a good and respectable move to give a timeline for alternative proposals - the timeline is December.
Based on what I've seen so far, not many people have been taking this timeline seriously. Many of the alternative proposals still don't have any usable code. There are a lot of theories about a lot of things but it is important to understand that the people who support BIP101 (me included) are not interested in theories that much but practise.
I'm simply a fan of a more leadership based development model for Bitcoin. I liked Core development more when there wasn't this "difficult issues stall for months or years" type of super-consensus method in place.
By the way claiming that the BIP101 supporters are not interested in debating stuff is absolutely false. There has simply been a period of debate leading nowhere and a desperate need for actual, practical, alternative proposals. These actual, practical, alternative proposals have been nowhere to be seen, thus there is no debate to be had. Hopefully that changes with the scaling conference.
@_date: 2015-12-30 11:12:38
I love the way some of these developers talk about this vague concept of "consensus" without ever explaining what it means or how a hard fork with consensus is supposed to be played out in practise. Or wait, does he mean Core developer consensus? Well, we know how that works.

Well, handling "everything" is not a very relevant issue. That's too long term to be concerned about. But VISA levels are quite achievable with blocksize increases + lightning network. And lightning network is still very much Bitcoin, it's trustless and not centralized. Very distributed in fact.

Well, the comment from Dan is also stupid. GHash didn't "back off", major mining operations quit using them is what happened.
For instance, Bitfury moved a lot of hashing power out of GHash during the "situation". Lots of others quit as well.
The only thing I don't like is that there is still too much focus on GHash, there should be more focus on CEX.

That BTM has a pretty high margin, around 8% if the timing is correct on the pictures. Our Bittimaatti network in Finland charges 5% currently.
The fees for BTM's are higher because they are competing more with OTC trade (fees from 5-10%) than with online exchanges. Also the costs of running BTM's is definitely higher than the relative cost of running an online exchange or broker. It requires real investment and maintenance costs. I know, because our business runs both.
BTM's provide, at least ours, unprecedented privacy that no other method of buying bitcoins can possibly match. It's always there at certain times when the location is open, reliable, no social contact needed.
The BTM is a competitor of the OTC trade such as LocalBitcoins. It's all about cash. All about privacy. Newbies not interested in privacy are better off using an online exchange with a mobile app or something.

There would still be lending. It will simply be more limited and the interest rates would be purely market driven.
However, it is possible that more "loose" monetary instruments will continue to be used, to support more lending. Who knows. Bitcoin can work side by side with local currencies.
Bitcoin is made to be the universal and international currency. It could become the strongest of them all. That doesn't mean it will be the only currency.

Bit is exactly the same as pound which is both a currency and a weight unit. It works. The confusion is purely theoretical and doesn't extend to real life situations unless the people involved are totally clueless.
Bit is the perfect unit. Short, easy, mainstream proof. It also fixed other issues. We can separate Bitcoin the network entirely from the currency units, linquistic wise.
A full bitcoin would be a "coin" while the new smaller unit would be a bit. The network would be Bitcoin just like it is now.

Any scenario where you need to actually have the bitcoins to use immediately, and want it fast.
I for one as a long time Bitcoin user have experienced this issue many times. Be it depositing to an exchange or receiving bitcoins to a wallet that need to be sent elsewhere immediately, running into a 45-minute block at the wrong time is a big pain in the ass.
Accepting 0-conf doesn't help if I want to have bitcoins to spend and send them to someone who also wants to spend them right away. We need a 1-conf that is fast. If you want high security, wait for 6 confirmations or more.
@_date: 2014-01-02 14:22:34
Physical gold has rarely been used as a medium of exchange directly, instead some kind of notes are used. This has allowed the entities holding gold in their vaults to give out more notes than the amount of gold that they actually have.
Bitcoin is a different animal. Bitcoins are used directly as the medium of exchange. It's cold money and the money trail can always be followed to where it originated (the mining block in question). Bitcoins can't be made from thin air in the same way as notes supposedly based on gold can.
Large Bitcoin exchanges and banks could try running their business with less than 100% reserve, sure. However it would be much more limited in many ways, compared to the system today and even the gold standard era. The incentive to store bitcoins in these centralized services is smaller, and the medium of exchange in the economy is bitcoins themselves, not some note.
Get it?
@_date: 2014-04-17 12:00:59
Indeed, but Internet based services rarely have an issue with 0 conf. Online stores and services that can be reversed have no issue with 0 conf because it's good enough for them to know sometime later that there was confirmations.

First of all, most wallets don't support sending unconfirmed bitcoins. Second, it doesn't really help when you look at the whole chain of transactions.
Imagine that I'm receiving a transaction that I want to send immediately to a 2nd party who wants to send that money immediately to a 3rd party. By the time the 3rd party actually has the bitcoins it could take hours with Bitcoin - unless the block interval is reduced.
Obviously it's not immediate with 2.5 minutes either, but it's a whole lot faster. It's also quite relevant to many exchange services and also ATM's that allow selling bitcoins. 2.5 minute blocks would simply give more room to define what security level is needed for a transaction of a certain amount.

Bitcoin services such as exchanges or in the future, banks, can theoretically operate with less than 100% reserve. 
It's just much more difficult than with any previous monetary instrument, since people have less incentive to store money in banks or vaults and Bitcoin transfers are more trackable and accountable than anything else.

The "store owner" isn't the use case I'm concerned about. There are thousands of merchant transactions going on with 0-conf every single day without problems.
The use case is a Bitcoin USER or an exchange, NOT a Bitcoin merchant. A user needs quick confirmations for quick resending etc, merchants don't need the confirmations right away.
@_date: 2014-10-11 17:08:35
I agree that other solutions exist for the problems I have mentioned. Greenaddress is perhaps the best solution for exchange &amp; ATM 0-conf. Good points, however I still wouldn't say it's trivial if the downsides aren't there.
Assuming a hard fork is coming anyway and solutions to solve the orphan issue will be implemented anyway, I don't really see a downside then.

It doesn't increase blockchain size either. That is dependent on the amount of transactions - reducing block interval doesn't magically increase the amount of tx.

@_date: 2014-04-17 12:07:36
I don't know why people have forgotten green addresses. I still think they could help to create a safer infrastructure.
Services such as Coinbase could use green addresses that would be accepted by services such as BitPay as safe. This would give merchants flexibility in terms of when they want to accept real 0 conf (depending on product value, situation) and when they should only accept 0 conf if there are other guarantees.
In the same way transactions with a higher fee could be seen as safer - in this instance the different fees between the old and new Bitcoin Core are making double spending much easier than usual.
There is no total solution to this I think but there could be more risk management than simply 0 conf or 1+ conf. Looking at the fees and/or using green addresses would add a new dimension.
Finally, I wouldn't really mind having a Bitcoin wallet at a service supporting green addresses. I could still have other wallets and have my savings elsewhere. It would reduce the risks of spending bitcoins significantly so that's why I think it's worth talking about.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:51:59
The way I see it is that the use of Bitcoin comes primarily from its features as a store of value. This part usually comes first and it only really makes sense as a payment system once you're in a position where you own bitcoins in the first place. And owning them rarely happens for other reasons except investing.
@_date: 2014-12-02 03:26:11
True enough. In Finland we need to currently check ID's only with very large amounts (over 10k).  It's a pretty sensible system. Nobody can launder a fortune using our machines but it still allows for decent sized transactions to be done in a private way. 
Also it's now VAT free, which is also very nice. Finland, at least for now, has a pretty good environment for Bitcoin business.

As I've tried to explain, this change is not for merchants it's for users, exchanges and 2-way ATM's etc. 
If you send me bitcoins that I need to send to a friend who wants to buy coffee with that money asap, he will end up waiting significantly longer for the coffee than with quicker blocks.
Exchanges/ATM's etc on the other hand would have more flexibility in how many confirmations are needed for a certain amount. It would make the system much more efficient overall.

Where do you think the money goes if not into a bank account? It doesn't matter if the money ends up in another bank account somewhere, it's still a deposit to a bank account which will increase the lending capacity of that particular bank.

As I said in my original post, certain services might benefit from green addresses for 0 conf transactions, in certain situations. I don't see a problem having a spending wallet in a service such as CoinBase, as long as I can keep my savings elsewhere. I don't see the problem.
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:00:43
This doesn't work! The benefit of using local exchanges is SPEED. The transfers are faster with local banking connections. Much faster. This is why our brokering service in Finland is popular.

Security is NOT lowered. 4x 2.5 minute blocks is mathematically speaking more secure than 1x 10 minute block. That is a fact.

It's very simple. If you sell, you're a weak hand. If you hold, you're a strong hand. That's all there is to it. Currently there are still weak hands out there who are prone to panic selling. They must be flushed out of the system.
Personally I'm almost 100% all-in and going to hold through this no matter what. Just like I've done for years now.
It's different to be a believer and to be experienced. Believing doesn't help if you haven't fully experienced the volatility of Bitcoin. Those of us who have been through this already have a much stronger mindset.
I fully agree with OP. The turning point is near. All the BS posts about the so called problems of Bitcoin and the amount of upvotes they have is a great indicator.
The problem overall has been that people expect Bitcoin to grow at the rate of a price rally. Newsflash: it doesn't. It grows, it actually grows quite fast, but the price can occasionally rise much much faster, which results in these price movements.
For historical reference Bitcoin has fallen 90% and 80% from the top in the last 2 price bubbles. This is business as usual, although I think Bitcoin will fall less this time. It was 90% in 2011, 80% in 2013. Perhaps it's 70% this time. We're quite close to that number now.
@_date: 2014-09-29 09:11:04
Clarification: being a strong hand vs weak hand isn't about who will make the right choice. Strong hands will lose the most if Bitcoin fails. They risk a lot by doing that. On the other hand weak hands risk to miss the massive opportunity and seek to limit their risk.
It's essentially about believing / non-believing. People who understand Bitcoin well are much more prone to be strong hands than people who don't, and that's a good sign in my book. Only time will tell who makes the right move, but I continue to be a believer.
And another clarification: day trading to gain more coins is a strong hand play. Selling to gain fiat is a weak hand play. It's all about the end game.
@_date: 2014-10-11 17:20:26
You don't understand. The halving happens every 192 000 blocks. If block interval was changed to 2.5, the halving would be changed to 768 000. The same way block reward would go to 1/4 of current. In that way nothing changes except the block interval.

The important part as far as bitcoin trading is concerned: you only lose if you sell and thus realize the loss. Long term the price of bitcoin is rising, as long as that holds true (and that we will only find out later) selling has only ever been a bad move (unless it's a day trader move to gain more bitcoin).
What people don't understand and they should is that everyone who has now ever sold bitcoins and didn't buy back or won't buy back, made a move that resulted in either a loss or less profit than they could've made. Even the ones who sold at $1200 might regret that in a couple of years if they don't buy back.
Bitcoin is very undervalued in the long term. Of course there are also risks. However from an "expected value" point of view, bitcoin is still by far one of the best investments in the world.
I come from a professional poker background by the way. Thus I find this lecture a bit funny. Bitcoin entrepreneur nowadays.

Quite true. However any high speed home network can handle blocks up to 20MB quite nicely. Remember that Internet connections used to be quite a bit slower in 2009.
It's also *not* a question of average home bandwidth. That notion should be thrown out of the window immediately. It's an issue of accessible bandwidth.
There is a whole other quite relevant issue which is the incentive of running a full node in general. I don't believe the blocksize has *any* significance to this when we're talking 1MB vs 20MB but it is a very relevant problem in its own right.

I've been to the US three times. Even though both countries are under a market system, Finland is more tuned to socialism and US to capitalism. That is one major difference. 
There are a lot of small differences here and there though. For example people in the US use cars way more than Finnish people - bikes and public transport are used much more here. And people walk more.
The offline transaction technology can increase the reliability of using Bitcoin for both users and merchants. This can be useful even in developed countries. Internet is still not always available. In developing countries it can open up even more possibilities.

This change can't be done via soft fork. The limit is a hard limit. From the "soft" side the solution is something done outside the regular blockchain, like lightning networks etc. Those are likely not ready in time though, which is why raising the block size is also required.
The "problem" of a hard fork is way overrated. If there is strong support from major services - which is what I'm trying to figure out here - a hard fork is completely harmless.

Will update the list based on this. While I agree it would be great to get more CTO opinions on the list, I'd say that many of the Bitcoin company CEO's are quite technical.
For example, the current CEO of BitPay is their former CTO and is in my opinion one of the smartest people in Bitcoin space.
In my case (Bittiraha.fi &amp; Denarium) we've talked about this within our team quite a bit and we are unanimously supporting the blocksize increase.

That is partially true, however it seems clear to me that all of the ones supporting it are supporting the 20MB increase specifically.

I understand your arguments. I don't see Bitcoin necessarily needing to aim at Visa transaction counts directly either. However Bitcoin does need to reach the amounts of regular wire transfers / SEPA *directly* and currently it simply doesn't cut it.
The 1MB limit is *not* some holy grail Satoshi came up with, with good reasons. No, unlike many of Bitcoin's features, this one was almost arbitrary and clearly meant as a temporary measure.
Summa summarum, I agree we shouldn't try to solve all transaction use cases with Bitcoin direct. However *even* taking that into account, 1MB is not enough.
Personally I see the 20MB as a great compromise. It does not affect full nodes requirements in any significant way and this has already been proven. And it allows the base network itself to handle at least a decent amount of transactions.

Our expansion plan varies based on which service we're talking about.
The Bittiraha.fi concept will stay in Finland for the moment and our Bittimaatti BTM network is also something we're not going to expand outside of Finland in the near future.
Denarium is already international but we will localize the website to other languages soon. Languages such as Germany, which is an important market for the coins.
Our new quick buy exchange service will be targeted to the UK market and we also plan on expanding it to the Nordics soon. And our offline transaction product will be as international as possible.
For future products such as the Bitcoin vault and ETF, we plan to pilot in Finland and target the Nordics soon after.

Our current overall operation does need funding because we're investing in the people that help us build the future innovations that will lead our company to a new level of growth.
In terms of revenue our current services are doing fairly well so we could be profitable on our own easily if we tightened up the business. Tightening it up too much is not a good thing when you're aiming at growth and that's why the funding is so important.

I don't think you understand how it works. Protocol rules are enforced by users, not miners alone. In fact the exchanges, merchant services and wallets hold the most power - not miners. In this case miners follow the rules, they don't make them.

Not really. They need major exchanges, merchant services &amp; wallets. Even if there was a node majority on the other fork, it would be mostly meaningless. Those nodes would find their "bitcoins" quite useless quite fast while the bitcoins on the other fork would remain perfectly useful.

Henry Brade from Bittiraha.fi here. We're a major local exchange service in Finland. 
This is true and should apply to all exchange services (full feature exchanges, local brokers, escrow services etc).
I'd like to remind everyone that next year a major EU VAT change is going to be applied. It means that for customers from another EU country one must pay the VAT of the customer's origin country. For digital services (not physical products). This should apply to bitcoin trade.
So to the contrary of some comments, very soon indeed this *only* applies to Finnish exchanges/brokers/escrows serving Finnish customers.

I still don't understand any of this. The 3.5x figure was the Safello valuation compared to ours. They were valued in their own crowdfunding round at 9 million and we're valued at 2.75 million, so that's where the 3.5x came from.
Our valuation has nothing to do with Safello but it's an interesting comparison because the numbers of Safello are similar if not weaker than ours. It's an example to show that our valuation is not "out there", it's in fact quite reasonable.
We've had revenue generating services with increasing revenue for over 3 years, so I don't understand the comparisons you're making.
In general, looking at our valuation, it's partly based on the innovations that we've recently come up with that have great potential. Our current services and current revenue alone does not justify that valuation, but valuating a startup is about the growth potential just as much as the current revenue and profitability.

Less aggressive schedule *is not* an option. That is Gavin's view, and also my view. The only alternative is a counter-proposal that is better than what we have now. Simply "opposing" is not going to work, there needs to be actual counter-proposals and not later - now.
Thus anyone who prefers a less aggressive schedule is overall against this change. The speed is of the essence here and actually defines if someone is supporting or opposing.

I don't have an exit strategy yet. I'm a Bitcoin enthusiast and I'm not doing it just for money. I am doing this because I think it is interesting and I believe Bitcoin can change the world (for the better). I'm not a short term person for anything in life, to put it one way.
In terms of organizational goals I have a clear goal and that is to build an organization that can do well without me. And not just well, I want to make myself irrelevant to the company eventually.
Currently I feel the company needs me so for the time being any kind of exit is not in the plans. With organizational evolution I hope to perhaps move to an advisorial position later but not in the short term. An exit strategy, if there is going to be one, will emerge later.
As for generating a return for investors, number one is to create services that generate revenue and not just revenue but profitably. Profit allows us to pay dividends and it also increases the value of our company which is also important.
Our company will be listing itself to Privanet ( some time after the funding round which will allow shareholders to more easily trade the shares. Privanet is an aftermarket for the shares of unlisted companies.
We can also give added value to investors with discounts to our services. Not necessarily a big deal for all of the shareholders but I believe some of them will find it beneficial.

This is a good question. Our approach to this issue is that we have to comply with the law. Tax authorities have significant rights in terms of gathering data during company tax inspections. There is little we can do if they are asking for something they have a right for.
Of course if they are asking for too much or too broadly, we will not just go along with it. We never release any customer data to authorities unless the specific situation and request gives them the right by law to get the data.
In terms of our mindset in general we are in favor of privacy, freedom and a light regulatory environment for Bitcoin companies.

We limit the ATM's to 15,000 EUR daily. It's limited by wallet balance and we have multiple ATM's in a single wallet. So technically it's 15k daily which includes multiple ATM's. So going around that limit is not that easy, one would have to do the 2nd transaction on another day at least.
I'd also like to add that the hot wallets don't contain that much at any one time. So a user would have to repeatedly buy 1-2k until the 15k limit hits, and then try again another day.

This is unfortunate indeed. I run a major Bitcoin exchange in the neighbouring country, Finland. Actually know the guys running this exchange from a couple of discussions at the conferences.
In Sweden the financial authorities are significantly more interested in Bitcoin than they are in Finland. Based on this news their approach seems quite hostile as well.
Hard to say much more though as I have no clue about the circumstances. Just speculating at this point.

You are correct! That change applies to all EU digital service providers and for all Finnish customers it would be VAT free. It does sound like a major hassle in general. I just heard about it from an accountant very recently.
However I think it's likely that big EU level VAT guidance on Bitcoin will be created, maybe next year. That can perhaps level the playing field. Hopefully it will all be VAT free in a few years.

We have 3 bank accounts in Finland, in different banks. Generally speaking smaller banks are more Bitcoin-friendly but that's not always the case. In Finland there have been some problems with the banks but it's not as severe as in some other countries.
My view is that small banks tend to view Bitcoin more as an opportunity and large banks tend to view it as a threat. We will continue to see both approaches from banks.

We started only with a small amount of capital from the founders. We had revenue from day 1. We operated without any external funding for the first 2 years. A little more than a year ago we had our first funding round of 105 000 €, to support our growth.
We have spent very little on lawyer fees so far. I mean something like a couple of thousand euros. We've had little need. The regulation in Finland is very light for Bitcoin, no need for licenses yet. And we haven't had any legal trouble with banks or companies or customers yet.
I'm not familiar with the situation in Caribbean overall, so it's hard for me to give good advice. But what I can say is that if you see a gap in the market, like if there is no proper Bitcoin services in the Caribbean now, just go for it.

In no circumstance would I propose this change in order to do a hard fork. It's not worth it. However, a hard fork will eventually happen. Probably fairly soon, next year even. Gavin has been talking about it already.
There will only be 1 hard fork. The next one will be not be soon after. That's why it makes sense to do multiple upgrades.
And don't get me wrong. I don't consider this a serious problem. But it would be an improvement. Is it worth it? Not sure, but I'm quite disappointed with the level of discussion.
Most others "for" are trolls. Many against are totally clueless about how Bitcoin works. Some good comments as well!
Just remember, in OP I'm assuming 1) a hard fork anyway and 2) other changes that make the orphan issue irrelevant. Thus no real downsides to this. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:04:00

I'm not the judge of anything. I'm interpreting the proponents overall view of the situation - if I'm wrong then someone will correct me. But I think I'm not.
The speed is important because the network is going to run into the current block limit hard *soon*. Based on calculations we will hit the limit hard even as soon as 6 months.
Bitcoin will continue to work of course, it's not a fatal issue in that sense. But it will reduce the usability of Bitcoin significantly - and this is the key issue.
The blocks are already occasionally full and this is extremely frustrating already. I can already recall dozens of situations where I've been cursing the whole system because a block takes 60 minutes and then the transactions isn't even there because the block is full.
It's in some cases currently impossible to even do anything about the fee of a transaction, depending on which services you're using. It's even harder to anticipate how much is enough - what if everyone else increases their fees as well. And so on.
The problems so far, which have been infuriating at times, are absolutely *nothing* compared to what we will see when we truly hit the limit. 
We've seen the effects of this limit truly only a couple of times - once in 2013 when we hit the soft limit of 250kb and miners upgraded to the higher soft limits. Currently the standard soft limit is 750kb. The other time we saw this was just a couple of days ago when the community did the stress test.
The stress test showed us that in that kind of situation it can take let's say 8 hours to clear a backlog of transactions made in 1 hour. In 12 months we might be in this situation normally and not just artificially.
Also the issue compounds itself. As Mike Hearn has demonstrated, it's a full on catastrophy. People will stop using Bitcoin, they will sell bitcoins etc. It will lead to a massive amount of transactions as people move money to exchanges etc, which makes the problem 10x worse.
Gavin and the other proponents like me *do not want to see this happen*. It's an *urgent* issue. One way or another, we need to work on this *fast*. This is why only counter-proposals are acceptable, not delaying the schedule.
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:08:12
If it's a tax inspection, then yes - we do give all the information that they have a right to. There is not much choice here.
I don't believe there is a way to fight it effectively. Even banks have fought against the taxman many times but the end result is that they have to give everything. I don't see how a court would rule any differently with a Bitcoin company so I'm extremely skeptical of the BTCX court case.
I'm not that familiar with the case, it's possibly they have made too broad requests or something like that. But based on my experiences with the Finnish taxman it's clear to me now that they are actually creating a database of everyones Bitcoin addresses. That can be fought against easily by how one uses Bitcoin. Not reusing addresses and using mixers will help.

Henry Brade, company CEO here. All dividends are paid out in bitcoin and currently it's annual. We're looking at changing that to quarterly in the future.
However it's unlikely that we would be paying significant dividends in the near future. Our goal is to grow and to invest in growth which leaves little room for dividends in the short term. 
Long term is a different story, it's of course a long term goal to be able to pay out dividends.

The blocksize issue is quite simply the most important and most urgent issue to solve or at least improve. You can't expect there not to be an instant reaction when someone like Gavin publishes anything about it anywhere.
Jumping the gun would be saying this *will happen*. Nothing like that has been claimed here. However fact is something needs to be done about it and I'm certainly glad the issue is again brought to the spotlight.
Scheduling the hard fork requires quite a bit of lead time so deciding at least the date sooner rather than later is *important*. I don't know if you've noticed, but the network is already occasionally quite slow to confirm transactions with lots of full blocks in a row. Imagine if we have a major adoption wave this year and how it will look like when it gets much, much worse.
This might not be the perfect proposal yet. Please finetune it. But do not schedule the hard fork at a later time than March, 2016. Please.

For this service we use a payment method not commonly used for bitcoin exchange. It's going to only work with smallish amounts and there will be some fees, but the ease of use is on a whole other level.

Disk space isn't a problem, as far as I know the price efficiency of disk space will continue to outpace the growth of the blockchain anyway. Bandwidth is a bigger issue and memory can also be an issue if the mempool of transactions becomes massive.
Although I think that it is quite clear none of those issues are very relevant. Currently even bandwidth should be quite fine up to 5-10MB blocks and it's very important to note that 20MB is only the maximum, it will take years to constantly see 20MB blocks. So there is time for bandwidth to become more efficient as well.

I don't think you understand numbers very well. The 2.75 valuation is pre-funding which means that anything that will be invested (for example 150k) is added to the total valuation. The percentage is calculated from that (for example 2.90).

Although it can't be disputed that there is division in the "core dev" community, one must understand that they are ultimately *not* in charge. Most relevant opinion in terms of the actual effects of a hard fork (for better or worse) comes from major exchanges, merchant services, wallets and other critical services.
One must understand that the proponents of this change do not see an alternative. The bottom line is that a software fork *is* going to happen no matter what. Then we'll see what the support is really and if the blockchain fork is viable or not.
I'm a strong proponent personally. I also see Gavin's approach as the right one. As there is little time left, the time to talk about this is also limited. The time for actual action steps is now and not later.
Also, I think it's wrong to say that core devs "know better" than the top devs in Bitcoin companies for example. This is ridiculous. The core devs have a different viewpoint but I would say that it's a limited viewpoint in its own right.
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:47:04
We operate multiple services so this question is quite broad but I will do the best I can.
Generally speaking we don't want to try and 1:1 copy the model of other companies. We are focusing on **unique value propositions** that will differentiate our services from others out there.
The new services we have in development have completely unique aspects to them and so does all of our old services as well. 
If it's the case of another company trying to copy us, we will rely on our superior brand and marketing skills to get an edge. And we would of course continue to develop new features at the same time.
In addition there are other possibilities. For example, we could consider joining forces with another local player. The European exchange/broker market is very splintered, I don't believe that even Coinbase has a major market share here. Each country has different companies that are doing pretty well locally but no one is doing really well Europe wide.
I do foresee a lot of consolidation happening in the European Bitcoin scene. Companies will disappear and they will merge and in the end there will be a smaller amount of larger companies. Pretty sure we will see this happening during the next couple of years.
And as you've probably guessed already, we intend to be one of those larger companies! :)

No, it isn't. The mining pools are a secondary concern. The miners will have to follow the protocol rules which are not set by the miners but enforced by full nodes at large.
Of course we should listen to the miners if we want to create rules that allow for decentralized mining but the miners have no special power in setting the rules.
@_date: 2015-05-15 12:53:43
Demonstrating the use of Bitcoin in real life in any way is good. There is too much talk in general, we need to get more people to immediately install a wallet and just try it. 
This can be demonstrated in a number of cool ways, for example recently we did a payment demo with a guy who has an implanted NFC chip in his hand. Granted, that was a little bit controversial but still. Doing actual demos is good.
@_date: 2015-05-15 16:44:21
No. We don't give the taxman any information automatically or annually. Tax inspections are a different story, in those cases we may be forced to give them some information.
Using Bitcoin in a private manner is highly recommended. Coinjoin and other mixers are a must if a person wants real privacy with Bitcoin.
I can say that the taxman is quite interested in Bitcoin users in Finland. They clearly see it can in some cases help avoid taxes and they're increasing the tracking of Bitcoin addresses.
So if one wants to use Bitcoin privately, do not reuse addresses and use mixers at least occasionally.
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:59:54
Well that's not necessarily "against". With 20MB max, we wouldn't actually see many blocks that big in a long while. It's the *max*. This is something people tend to forget in this discussion.

On a (slightly) more serious note, I do think Bitcoin will soon(ish) start a new uptrend that will take the market cap to the next level. Fundamentally Bitcoin economy is growing and developing at an impressive rate and it's just a matter of time when we'll see another uptrend in price.
In terms of numbers it's hard to say because the range is so wide. We could be at $300 or $3000. Honestly. Bitcoin can move up very quickly when it gets into that mode, but it's really hard to know when it will happen.
But yes, overall I'm quite bullish.

All of us didn't quit jobs, in fact we worked basically with no wage for over a year. We started paying wages in 2013 when it started to make sense. I personally worked almost full time from the beginning, my savings helped me to survive.
Also some of our founders moved on after the "no wage" phase to do other things. We had a large core founding team of 8 and currently 4 founders work in the company and 2 are in board/advisor positions.
We are not registered as a money exchanger because bitcoins are not money in Finland. There are no license requirements at the moment. That's a big reason for low legal fees (so far).

No, but it does get us at least close to regular wire transfer / SEPA levels. This is a much more relevant benchmark than Visa, which is something we can use "lightning network" for.

I don't think that any of the core Bitcoin businesses are against decentralization. However there is clearly the idea of "enough decentralization" versus "maximum decentralization". The companies are clearly more in the "enough decentralization" camp with significant emphasis on Bitcoin usability. The opponents are in the "maximum decentralization" camp with less or no regard to usability.
Personally I see another view on decentralization that is important. The tech guys against this change are looking at it purely from a computerization angle. The other angle is how decentralized is the userbase of Bitcoin and I think that in this regard it's quite hard to say which model is truly more decentralized, "technically decentralized with less users" or "technically less decentralized and more users".
For example, if transaction fees go way high, people with less money will not be able to even use Bitcoin directly. So much for decentralization.
@_date: 2015-05-15 12:45:57
Our greatest contribution will be the offline transaction project. It could be a great business case for us but it will also make the Bitcoin network as a whole significantly more robust.
We have also been thinking of sponsoring a core developer, which we might do in the near future. Also we do run a couple of full nodes, so that supports the network as well.
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:59:54
I actually asked them myself. Let's see if they answer.
@_date: 2016-01-13 20:10:24
This is true. And this is precisely why the miners will not be switching any hard forks on without major userbase adoption. The fear of 75% being "too little" is simply a technical concern, it is not founded in any  realistic scenarios.
@_date: 2015-05-04 01:24:23
Well of course they are! Anyone in their right mind will suggest an increase to the absolutely minimal 1MB we're currently working with.
My thinking is this: let's reach Wire/SEPA tx amounts directly and Visa tx amounts with a lightning network. That would actually make sense.
@_date: 2015-01-01 09:31:27
I also think there is reason to believe it could have been someone else but obviously Karpeles is a suspect. I'd like to make a small correction here though, if Karpeles did it he doesn't have the coins. He spent the coins, mostly at price levels far below current price. Which means the coins can't be recovered. That's the theory at least.

Bitcoin exchange is VAT free which is very good. Gains made from selling bitcoins are subject to capital tax as usual.
@_date: 2016-01-01 18:46:38
This is how it is supposed to be. Core will have to prove their scaling plan will actually achieve scaling without the problems that the big blockers are afraid of.
If not, there will be a robust alternative in place which miners &amp; businesses can quickly adopt if they like.
By the way I would recommend promoting 2-4-8 or BIP202 as the actual blocksize increase for now instead of BIP101. Otherwise getting widespread miner support can be very difficult.
@_date: 2015-05-15 12:43:36
I'd say that it's important to separate users and owners. The amount of bitcoin owners is probably around 50,000 but perhaps 10% of that number is active users.
Our exchange services have had 25,000 unique Finnish customers with over 65,000 orders &amp; 20 million EUR processed.
I would say that currently there is no significant growth in terms of users. Hype levels are fairly low, which is related to the price situation quite a bit. Most Bitcoin users here use it for investing after all.
For us it's all about creating the services that transform Bitcoin's benefits to actual use cases which include incentives to use Bitcoin. 
For example, during the summer we will launch this "Bitcoin week" concept in Finland where a large amount of merchants give significant discounts for purchases made with Bitcoin and we put 0 fee on our exchange services. That, with successful promotion, will result in more mainstream users trying out Bitcoin.
In terms of merchant growth there has been great development in Finland. Recently Varusteleka started accepting Bitcoin, that is a top-5 webstore in Finland. Auto-Outlet, a Tesla reseller, accepts it. Also we have 3 regular grocery stores now accepting Bitcoin, 2 of them in Helsinki, the capital.

Yes, but I'm talking before the *blockchain split*. Remember that a software fork and a blockchain fork are two completely different things. We can play around with software forks all day long and that is temporary - a blockchain fork is permanent.
The point is that all the experimentation with XT is harmless if handled correctly.
@_date: 2016-03-17 01:45:27
This is false. Upgrading is all about incentives. The more incentive there is, the faster the upgrade. SegWit will likely be fairly quick. Hard fork is quicker since there is maximum incentive.

Not really. We've had more problems with fraud in our online exchange. To reduce problems we've had to work on improving fraud detection. Fraud can be a major issue for Bitcoin companies but we're handling it pretty well.
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:38:56
We have a section on the website about tax issues. And believe me, there has been quite a lot of discussion about this. Even Finnish mainstream media has talked about this. So if a user does not know they're supposed to pay taxes and doesn't pay and gets in trouble, is that our fault?
There is one difference between us and BTCX though which might be important. We don't operate a wallet service, BTCX does. I believe that this might be the reason why BTCX is fighting it. As we don't operate wallets, the information the taxman can get from us is limited.

I found out about Bitcoin in April 2011. For the first 6 months or so I was doing a lot of mining, learning and some investing. Later in the year me and my co-founders saw a gap in the market and decided to go for it. In March 2012 we started our company and now it has been in operation for over 3 years.
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:18:54
No. To increase the block size, a hard fork *is* needed. This is not up for debate. The debate is about when we should increase it and by how much. Proponents are in a hurry, opponents are not.
@_date: 2016-01-03 11:38:58
Armstrong doesn't seem to understand that it is full nodes that enforce protocol hard rules. Miners already vote for soft fork upgrades but that it all they can do alone. Any hard protocol rule change must be supported by the users and businesses to make any sense for the miners to update.
Other than that his notions of competing software and the blocksize increase generally seem smart.
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:04:45
Currently the biggest concern with blocksize is this: can Chinese miners handle it? Will there be a crippling latency divide between Western &amp; Chinese miners? Etc.
Chinese miners together control around 50% of the network. With this proposal we can be fairly confident that blocksize will never be too big for Chinese miners to handle.
And looking at it from the other side: if Chinese miners can handle a certain blocksize, so can everyone else. 
It's hard to see serious, realistic risks with this proposal. At least I don't see them at the moment.

I'm sure that most of us here are well aware of this, but I agree that it is very important. If the largest players are on board, the hard fork will be mostly harmless. Smaller players are simply forced to follow suit.

More growth is needed for sure in terms of users. Merchant growth is pretty good right now but user growth not so much.
I believe that Bitcoin adoption happens in waves and we're soon going to see the next wave. So I'm not worried about it in that sense.
Also we need more use cases and incentives to use Bitcoin. This is the primary focus of our company.
@_date: 2016-01-07 15:59:48
A single miner can't game this since it uses the median block size. Average block size would be gameable but median not so much. Of course if a multiple miners together want to put the max blocksize really high, they can, but as Pair said in the article - a group of miners having over 50% of the network can already do harm to Bitcoin if they want to.
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:54:15
Miners will double spend? lol. You mean 51% attack? Why would they do that? It's not like it would help their case of a better fork. Who would like to be on a fork with miners that do that kind of thing?
Not that it matters at all. Miners create the blockchain but they don't set the rules. If there is a major problem with the miners, the users can easily change the entire protocol to use a different hash algorithm, making all current ASIC miners entirely obsolete.
The miners are at the mercy of the wider userbase, NOT the other way around. Miners can do whatever they want within the rules, but if they start screwing things up - the userbase at large has ultimate power.
Technically full nodes enforce the protocol rules and in actuality the full nodes that run the largest Bitcoin services are most relevant since most economic activity go through them.
Miners are full nodes as well so they do have a say but no more than anyone else. I recommend researching how Bitcoin works a little bit more as this seems to be a common area of misunderstanding. The power of the miners is large within the rules but very limited in terms of setting the rules.
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:25:31
Bitcoin has all the potential as the future true universal currency precisely because it is simultaneously digital cash &amp; gold. If we remove either, it's much worse off. Not necessarily a death blow, but removes a lot of the potential.
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:53:59
Certainly. Each wallet has a policy on how they handle change. Change is the excess bitcoin amount of a Bitcoin transaction. For example if you have 4 bitcoins somewhere and you're sending 3 to another address, then 1 bitcoin needs to be sent somewhere as well. Usually this is another address in the same wallet (most likely a new address).
It is usually fairly easy to analyze which output in a Bitcoin transaction is the change and thus is very likely going to an address that is part of the same wallet from which the previous transaction originated.
This is one powerful technique to create clusters of addresses that can be identified as a single wallet and if there is a lead on the identity of the user, it can be assumed that everything from that cluster is related to that user.
Different wallets handle change addresses differently and some of them handle them better. In terms of anonymity. But still, without using mixers or coinjoin this can be a major privacy issue.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:03:12
It's also an issue of governance. Who decides what major updates should be implemented into Bitcoin? The developers at Bitcoin Core seem to think that it is them, or at least they are not putting any political effort on gathering concensus for a hard fork change.
This means that the initiative for a hard fork must, by definition, come from elsewhere. Bitcoin Classic is this initiative.
Importantly, this does not mean that Core &amp; Classic can't co-exist. Core can at some point simply decide that Classic has enough consensus behind it and import the same patch to Core. I personally believe two competing implementations can co-exist even if only one takes the initiative to change the consensus rules.
I'm going to write a blog post about this soon to explain the potential of co-existing.
@_date: 2016-01-19 10:40:36
SegWit is indeed a very good update, but much more complex than a 2MB hardfork. It is a perfectly reasonable stance to go 2MB hard fork first, and then SegWit which could be done with a lesser time issue and more care.

It's not the value of the silver what it is about. It's the value of the silver combined with the value of the bitcoins, in the same package. And that particular coin is a very limited edition, the scarcity is why it has value.

Our first funding round was in early 2014, with a 1.5 million valuation. It was a private round with 3 investors. We raised 105,000 € in total then.
From that time our company has matured quite significantly which was the basis for our 2.75 million current valuation.
Another point is the comparison to other similar Bitcoin companies and also the  fact that this is an open crowdfunding round and not a private round.
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:28:16
This is quite possible but there is still a chance to fix the mistakes. But this may be the last chance.
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:50:24
This is true, however the important part is that 20MB with current technology is about the same as 1MB back then. It does *not* make things any worse in terms of ddos or centralization whatnot. It does however allow the network to process a whole lot more of transactions, which *is* important.
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:27:35
I'm well aware of the capabilities of mixers and so on. If one trades with cash and uses mixers, it's very anonymous. But other than that, not so much. Bitcoin can be used anonymously but it is fairly difficult, I'd say. With confidential transactions privacy becomes easier.
And currently it's often quite polarized. You're either using Bitcoin very privately or very visibly. If it's anything other than "very privately", it's just a matter of incentive to track your stuff down, and the resources.
I operate Bitcoin businesses of different types myself (online exchange, BTM's, physical bitcoins) and I use Bitcoin all the time personally (since 2011) so I'm well aware of how things work. It's just my experience that unless a user is spending significant learning effort and does things precisely in the right way, it is easy to become non-anonymous using Bitcoin.
Certainly much easier to use Bitcoin very non-anonymously than using it anonymously. Joinmarket is a great effort though, if it becomes widespread in more wallets it can really help with this issue.
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:29:20
One big difference is that this is a very simple change to make to Bitcoin. Now what remains is to thoroughly analyze the impact, which will be done.
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:53:54
SegWit fixes other things besides increasing capacity. It fixes transaction malleability which is a nasty bug in Bitcoin that has been used to make attacks quite recently even.
In terms of capacity I think the best plan would be to hard fork to 2MB blocksize so that we have a 100% certain timeframe of capacity increase. Then we can let SegWit be implemented when its ready as a soft-fork.
In total this would increase capacity to around 3.75MB from current 1MB which is pretty good (for now).

Indeed, a regular user node has little power. In case of a hard fork everyone will very likely follow the fork with economic majority behind it. But miners can't form economic majority alone.
@_date: 2016-01-03 14:40:58
Yes, but the holders will likely see their coins go down heavily in value compared to the exchange-rich and miner-rich fork compared to the one which is weak in exchanges and miners. Thus it is very likely the holders will value the higher value fork quite a lot more.
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:11:49
How does it matter, at all, how the code that is implemented is used? Regardless of which client users of Bitcoin run in order to use that code, it is still code that is made by the developer who made it, and used by users of Bitcoin.
I personally don't understand the issue at all. Developers seriously need to start thinking that their allegiance is to BITCOIN in general, not to a specific client implementation.
The only reason to be strongly allied to a certain implementation is POWER and that is one of the reasons why Classic exists. Many believe Core has too much power and the reactions of many Core developers are fear of losing that power.
@_date: 2016-01-03 12:29:36
Not everyone needs to follow in advance. The nodes that lag in updating will very likely update to the fork with economic majority quickly. And that is primarily decided by exchanges and miners together.
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:22:55
There is enough support for that still, to put it out there. Keep in mind that the proposal is active until 2018. Even if it does not pass now, it is actually good that it exists.
For example, if there were extra delays with SegWit or other concerns related to it, it is much faster to implement 2MB increase if there is actual code / actual proposal, instead of just talk.

We have a service like this in Finland (with Finnish payment methods) at  and we are going to soon launch an international version of it.
Basically it's the fastest possible way of buying bitcoins and you can even scan a QR code to easily pay someone else directly. Our form requires no other info except the Bitcoin address.
We advocate a low friction purchase experience. Due to fraud concerns this service is limited to small amounts though, currently we're running it at 300 € per day per user and we have multiple methods of detecting if its the same user.
We'll have a big launch later when we publish the international version of this. It will first launch in the UK for really small purchases but we are expanding from there.
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:08:57
Classic wants to publish patches not only to the current version of Bitcoin Core but also to some older versions. And to all OS's of course. This will make sure everyone can update even if they want to use a specific Bitcoin Core codebase.
Additionally the Classic team is still debating on the exact parameters of the hard fork, I believe. Like what kind of grace time is put on the hard fork etc.
When they publish, it will be all in one sweep.

I have to say that I really like Copay as well, and can definitely recommend it. It's excellent especially for company &amp; family use as it is very easy to use but highly secure. It can also be used for personal multisig storage of course.

Without stuff like confidential transactions bitcoin is less private than almost anything else. Blockchain analysis is simply *that* powerful. All transactions are recorded for all eternity - everything that can be analyzed will be analyzed. We desperately need more powerful privacy tools.

That proposal not yet reviewed properly by other devs and accepted as a good idea. Many question marks still remain in regards to an UASF.
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:26:38
I've seen this argument bounce around a couple of times. And let me get this straight: it's not a good one.
Bitcoin development in general is serving Bitcoin users, no one else. If the users decide it's time for change in direction, it's time for change in direction. 
If particular devs don't like it, they can either suck it up and continue developing stuff in Bitcoin that both the developer himself and the users appreciate, or they can quit.
That's natural process. The way it should be. Developers usually care most about developing stuff that concerns themselves but if it doesn't concern the userbase at large, there is a conflict of interest.
The right way to solve that conflict of interest is not for users to compromise, the compromise must come from the devs.
For any reasonable dev this should not be a black &amp; white issue. Raising the blocksize to 2MB shouldn't be a killing blow to anything especially when it gets widespread ecosystem consensus (and the hard fork to 2MB won't otherwise happen).
If they quit, then they quit. It's a major loss for the development resources of Bitcoin but Bitcoin will recover from that. However Bitcoin can't recover from a disconnect between the needs of users and development in general, as that will cause a critical bleed in users to other options than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:24:48
Lol. Those who refuse to upgrade to a fork with economic majority will  be the ones who need to be very careful to not lose all the value of their precious "bitcoins".

"Still, we believe it is critical that the Bitcoin community be able to freely discuss and critique every aspect of Bitcoin."

@_date: 2016-01-07 13:47:08
Reusing or not doesn't really matter much. Most Bitcoin wallets handle the change addresses in such a way that it is quite easy to analyze and find clusters that essentially represent 1 wallet and thus is likely to represent 1 user (with some exceptions).
So, if there is some proof that one of the transactions is indeed related to a real life person, it is easy to immediately see a potentially large amount of other transactions which can be linked to that wallet with very high probability.
Only mixers / coinjoin and stuff like that can protect from that kind of analysis. Of course the analysis first needs some proof, like there has to be a lead. The analyzer needs to *know* that address x is someones address, and then can find out with high probability which other addresses are part of the same wallet.
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:54:26
Then real progress has been made in this whole debate. That is promising.

Everyone wants SW since it's great, however it's a time / priority issue. The concerns regarding SW are the following:
- SW has had technical testing and that is ongoing, but the economical analysis of SW is almost non-existent at this point. It's a more complex change overall than a blocksize increase.
- SW will increase capacity to at most 1.6-1.7 MB and that is basically when all wallets update. Somewhat similar update previously (multisig / p2sh) took around 6 months to be more or less fully implemented. SegWit may be faster due to higher incentives but is still likely to take multiple months.
Now some other things to take into account. Large blockers have already compromised to a 2MB blocksize increase (they were way higher before) but SW is actually even less than that. It's the inability of Core to make so called "political compromises" that is putting a lot of people off.
The "Ivory Tower" approach is a serious social problem for the larger Bitcoin ecosystem. Core has been improving communications lately which is just great but still more needs to happen in terms of action.
For example, Core could say that let's agree to schedule a hard fork in 6 months. So 6 months from now, we hard fork to 2 MB. That is locked in. Then we can soft fork to SegWit starting from 1st of April (if it is ready).
So for the summer we would have approximately 1.5MB capacity, that's great. And then we would have around 3.5MB capacity for the winter (with the hard fork in the fall). 
This would be a sensible plan and I think that pretty much all "large blockers" would back it right away. But is Core capable of doing the same? Doesn't seem so, yet. It's either their vague roadmap (especially vague in regards to hard fork scheduling) or nothing.
I'd say that right now the crisis is more about governance and the ability to make hard fork level decisions as a community, than it is about the actual technical problem at hand.
@_date: 2016-01-09 18:29:06
Good example of a situation where the LocalBitcoins model is a win. Centralized brokers can't do that because they get shut down.
@_date: 2016-01-08 06:53:28
It's not really like that. All the "large blockers" are very flexible on the actual proposal. For example, Brian from Coinbase has already praised this particular proposal and is very interested in it. There is a strong chance big blockers could rally behind this proposal and start lobbying the miners actively.
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:35:09
As long as the blocksize issue is on the table, this is not going to happen. Fork proposals are going to be on the table. In fact, they are likely to be *more* on the table as long as this censorship continues.
And Core is also making itself an enemy here, increasingly. As long as they don't officially sign the Garzik proposal of the meaning of altcoins, they basically support r/bitcoin censorship. And that will just make the "community fork" worse.

1. In terms of physical security, these are no different than Casascius coins. In fact very similar. So the DEFCON hack does work, however it's very important to note that it's not a perfect hack. There will be a visible mark on the hologram, albeit small, if one does that hack. Also this has not been a major issue with Casascius coins or their aftermarket. Our concept is affordable, low-cost coins, which means that we aren't focusing on super high security. For our future premium products we will add countermeasures that make the DEFCON hack useless.
2. The contact page has the FAQ in it. Just click the FAQ button from there. It's on the same area as the contact form.
3. The private key is inside the coin and nowhere else. This means that the user can recover the coins with any proper Bitcoin wallet at any time. They are not redeemed through us in any event. Our coin is more advanced in this sense as we have the private key also as a QR code inside the coin. It can be imported quickly to the Mycelium wallet for example.
4. In June when we ship the first batch we are going to launch a search engine on our website. This will allow users to easily input the serial number of the coin and see the public address of the coin and the current balance of the coin. As the coins can have variable amounts of bitcoin, especially the ones sold as empty, this is very important. We are going to make this easier than with any other coin product.
@_date: 2015-05-07 15:13:44
And that's exactly what should be done. Proponents think this MUST be done NOW and opponents disagree. There is no way around it.
We can easily monitor which version people use and see well in advance of March 2016 if it has support or not.

I agree that they currently have limited market but it is not about that. It's about having a credible fallback in case the Core scaling roadmap fails. Then there would be a market and it is better to have the product ready.

Growth for the blocksize is exactly what is needed and what should happen but with a controlled process which ensures that the participants in the network can handle blocks of that size.
This proposal ensures that any increase can be handled by the Chinese miners and thus by everyone else. 
The goal should be to increase the blocksize as much as humanly possibly, and I think this proposal would provide maximum blocksize growth without running into latency issues and such.

If you want that, you should support SegWit. That would quickly slash fees back down again, and allow people to start testing exponential scaling solutions such as the Lightning Network with real money.
Imagine a future where we can send microtransactions worth only cents, using Bitcoin? That was not possible with Bitcoin before, and it is not possible now. But with SegWit and other solutions, that could be possible!
@_date: 2016-01-19 03:57:34
This is a great idea. It just has one big but. Core is not capable of compromise! Period. At least that is how I see it. There is the Core scaling roadmap, and it's either that or they "quit". As silly as it is, this seems to be how it is.
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:52:28
I don't think companies are anti-segwit. Segwit solves malleability which is great. But as a scaling solution it is limited at best.
@_date: 2016-01-08 19:04:16
Big blockers are quite flexible regarding the proposals. The reason there has not been a unified rally yet is because the big blockers themselves are unsure which is the best proposal. But as the blocks get more full, unity will certainly form.
I believe this proposal has a good chance of gathering support. Brian from Coinbase already commented positively on it. If they can get other major players on board, they could start pressuring the miners with this.
I believe this is what is going to happen, if the tests / further analysis of this proposal lead to positive results. I think other options of a unified blocksize increase front are unlikely since miners are simply against BIP101 so it's very difficult to lobby that proposal to them.

Actually it's more about (Core) developers and their supporters VS the userbase in general. Classic is simply the means that the userbase in general is using to combat the central planning committee approach that Core is using.
Nobody really cares about "Classic" in the sense. It's a tool that will hopefully connect the needs of users at large and what developers are actually doing. What tool is used to make this happen is irrelevant as long as it happens.
@_date: 2016-01-19 10:43:39
If that is true, there is hope for a peaceful compromise. Which obviously would be the best result for everyone. At this stage I'm personally quite tired of the whole debate as are probably many others, it's time to truly find a compromise.
The fear I have is that if one or two prominent Core contributors simply NACK the compromise plans it's back to square one.

That's not really a problem with today's tools. It's easy to verify that the clients work together and have the same consensus rules. Even btcd which is a complete re-write in a different programming language, works very well in the network since 2014.
And due to well, leadership and people issues, clearly some people don't even want to work in the same team in development. Different implementations and different teams is in many ways healthy. It's the duty of each maintainer to make sure their client stays in sync with the rest of the network.

Hard forks are always "later" and never with an exact date scheduled. There is only the well-in-advance scheduled hard fork or the emergency fork. Core seems to be for the latter since they have no interest in scheduling a fork in advance.

I'm not an expert on how each wallet handles change addresses and coin selection. But I do know that it is an issue, since there has been lot of talk about that in the Bitcoin community.
With change addresses it is important to always create new ones. But another major issue is coin selection.
Coin selection is basically the logic a wallet uses to select coins for spending. So if you have many addresses in a wallet with btc balance, with what logic does it choose from where to spend?
Let's say if you have 10 bitcoins in a wallet and you are sending 2 somewhere, how does it select the 2? This has been identified as a privacy issue and in fact there has been talk about improving this in Bitcoin Core just a few months ago.
Analyzing one's Bitcoin usage is highly dependent on what the wallet is doing. But I think the most important thing is not wallet side, it's the fiat-btc gateway. Using cash is way more anonymous than using bank transfers.

SegWit is backwards compatible. Transactions from Armory may just be a bit slow or need more fee in the future, but they will go through. It would require a major hard fork for an old Armory version to be completely incompatible. And something like that is not coming this year, at least.
@_date: 2016-06-10 13:28:08
Money talks. Everyone knows scaling must be solved *somehow*. The direction has been clearly set by ugly consensus and the direction is the layered approach. 
I personally used to be a strong on-chain scaling advocate previously but as I've studied the whole issue more, I kind of like the current approach. On-chain scaling is also needed but still most transactions could be off-chain in the future, through lightning networks and sidechains such as drivechain.
There is actual real tangible progress on SegWit, Lightning networks and Sidechains. It is getting solved. But the solution is not instant. It takes time. What really matters is that the incentives are there - everyone knows Bitcoin must scale one way or another.

@_date: 2017-01-25 20:07:10
They quite possibly will, but I'm continuing to try to reason. Important thing in my mind is that the people who understand this, should always mention that a block size increase in the future is not thrown out of the window.
For example many estimates say that regardless of the lightning network, block size will likely need to be increased at some point. This is important since some big blockers think that SegWit is the route to never doing any hard forks, which I don't personally agree with.

They are not in contradiction, whatsoever. The point about stability was about the general long term trend of increasing stability and the long stable period that has preceded the current short term rally.
Historically the price has always been fairly stable preceding large explosions. It's simply the pattern which Bitcoin has grown with. Big rally, downtrend, stability. Repeat. My opinion is that we're now in the beginning stages of the next big rally.
That is strongly tied to some of my arguments in point 10. The market has a cycle and the stable phase is important. People need to forget the downtrend and start feeling optimistic again, for a new rally to be possible. That is now happening.
The decreased volatility in the long run, as seen in the graph, is a result of the growing market value of bitcoin. It is getting bigger in terms of exchange liquidity, trading volumes and so on. That allows bigger players to enter the market, to fuel the next big rise.
From a fundamental perspective the possibilities of investing in bitcoin in 2013 were nowhere near what they are now. This time it's possible for almost anyone, even institutions, to invest in bitcoin. This is a major factor in what is going to happen in the near future.

There was no code or implementation ready for a soft fork version of SegWit at the time of the agreement. That part was vaporware. As is the case with everything related to this, it has changed. Lightning used to be vaporware as well, is not any more. Delving in the past is not smart, what matters is where we are now.
The proposal has stalled in terms of miner support, yes. But if you look at any other metrics, SegWit is doing great. Node support is increasing every day and more and more services in the ecosystem are ready for it.
Meanwhile the big blocker crowd has transitioned from reasonable, more widely supported proposals, to insane proposals such as what BU is advocating. That has not helped the situation, in fact it has made it worse.
If the big blocker crowd would be open for a post-SegWit HF that is actually conservative in the details of the block size increase, there is possibility to make a new agreement.
I used to be a big blocker in the past, but no longer, as the big blockers have lost their minds. But I would still be ready to accept a conservative block size increase HF which would be implemented sensibly. But not before SegWit activation, as it would make no sense. The HF takes a very long time, SegWit needs to be enabled first.
@_date: 2016-06-09 22:28:22
1) It's 100 % true that it is more stable than ever. I didn't claim it's stable, which it certainly isn't. If it was like the USD I would certainly not recommend it as an investment, either.
2) The next crash is actually potentially about the currencies themselves. Bitcoin has a good chance of being one of the big winners as it's simply immune to a lot of the potential issues of national currencies.
3) For the whole 7,5 years that Bitcoin has existed, the price has been higher than the current price for approximately 9 months or so. Think about that for a bit. If I'd pick a timeframe that looked especially bad, *that* would be skewed.
Generally speaking Bitcoin is not going to be truly stable for a long time. And it may not become USD level stable ever, since that is artificial. But becoming more stable is a clear sign of growth.
@_date: 2016-06-10 13:40:04
We can agree to disagree on this one. My view is that investments in anything repeat a cycle of investor sentiment but that does not mean that is all there is to it. Fundamentals play a crucial role, of course.
The development of bitcoin as a financial instrument should be compared to something like the stock index, or a major fund which includes a lot of companies. Just like the stock market generally has these periods of rally, stability and downtrend, so does bitcoin.
It does require solid fundamentals. It requires continued growth of the ecosystem. I believe bitcoin passes these tests, it is growing in many ways. The issue can't be thought of as a technical price issue or a fundamental question separately - they both matter.
The points in my article were both price technical and fundamental. It is important to take them all into account to understand the whole picture and not just get stuck on this "price graph will repeat" issue.
I agree the price graph will not repeat if the fundamentals are not there. But I claim that if the fundamentals are there, it will. That is how the investor psychology works.
Then I want to comment specifically on this:
"The market may move because of news articles, whales, legal decisions, insider deals, bots, software bugs, and a thousand more factors that don't even out and can't be clumped together in one category that can be easily modeled."
Here you're confusing short term movements with long term market sentiment. All of those factors and a thousand others, just like you say, can affect the market in the short term. But the long term development is *about the masses*. It's about the general sentiment of people, groups, friends, colleagues, the media, and so on. Nothing else matters in the long run. 
But it needs to be backed up by solid fundamentals in order to last, and to continue to repeat, just like I explained earlier.

Indeed this is how most people start Bitcoin. It's an experiment and a small investment at first and then grows to become perhaps a larger investment and a currency.

I recommend Anonibet. Used it without problems for years.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:13:40
I can try to explain this. There are mainly a couple of reasons.
First of all finding a way to improve scaling without a hard fork is highly preferable since the community seems to have massive troubles in agreeing what kind of hard fork to exactly do. There are gazillion proposals about this and pretty much no agreement on which to move forward with.
Secondly raising the block size a little bit is a temporary fix to the capacity issues. Real big time scaling can only be done with massive block size increases or figuring out ways to optimize the use of the block space and adding layer 2 technologies to process large amounts of tx. 
Doing massive block size increases is deemed unacceptable by experts since it dangers the decentralization of bitcoin, and that is why the 2nd route is pursued by Bitcoin Core, which is about optimizing the use of the block space and adding layer 2 technologies such as the lightning network.
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:42:40
Yes, I completely agree with this. Personally I still have hope that there is a chance for moving forward together.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:14:55
Well, SegWit hard fork is fucking stupid. It may be technically cleaner, but hard forks should not be done unless absolutely necessary. It is not absolutely necessary if we have a soft fork option. It's that simple.

@_date: 2017-01-27 20:07:40
I'm sorry. Really, I am. I don't mean to be mean. It's simply frustrating because Core has been working hard to produce more information on this, and then people still criticize SegWit without actually learning about it properly first. Core is doing a good job in producing information and as far as I know it is very accurate.
I can further explain what SegWit does to old version nodes. They do lose some functionality but not critical functionality. For example, 0-conf payments would be significantly more unreliable for non-upgraded nodes, than they are now. Since without being included in a block, the non-upgraded node can't validate the transaction properly based on just a broadcast.
I don't consider that critical since accepting 0-conf payments is unsafe anyway. Those merchants and services that somewhat rely on 0-conf payments must update to a SegWit version to have similar reliability to now. Without upgrading they are basically accepting transactions blindly until it gets confirmations.
When the transaction has confirmations, it is as secure as it is now, even for old nodes. However the is a small caveat here as well: if a miner has not upgraded and produces a block, which the old nodes will find valid, they could see 1-conf transactions that will not be valid later.
This is why there is a 95% miner threshold and all non-upgraded clients should wait for multiple confirmations (not just 1) until basically all miners have upgraded.
So the reality is that old nodes do work *mostly fine*. Not entirely, 100% the same, as they would before the upgrade. But if the old nodes make sure to wait for multiple confirmations for the transaction, the security is not in any significant way reduced.
And soon after the transition, as all miners have updated, even 1-conf will be just as safe as now. 0-conf insecurity can only be fixed by upgrading though, no way around that.
And importantly, this does not at all affect the abilities to send transactions. Only receiving transactions, to a certain degree, as I explained.
This is how I understand it, based on what I've read. If some technical expert disagrees, please chime in.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:19:07
Seriously... all this information is out there in the SegWit information packages and FAQs. All full nodes and SPV clients will continue to function after SegWit activation even if they don't upgrade. Miners pretty much need to upgrade though, that's why there is a 95% threshold.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:09:49
Yeah, remove one of the most innovative companies in the space, great idea. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 19:59:34
The whole debate about the trigger point is concentrating way too much on the technical side of it. Real life experience has shown us that miners are among the most conservative in adopting a fork enabling change. 
This means that they are simply not going to do it unless there is major economy adoption for the fork enabling version already.
On the other hand achieving 95% can be extremely difficult even if almost everyone is in line since there can always be some miners who simply resist for the sake of it or don't care about anything, thus it can stall the whole process for way too long.
If the miners were generally reckless even a little bit, I would be concerned about 75%. But they are not. They are the most conservative party in the equation (well, some Core developers are just as conservative) and this is not really a major concern at all.
It's only a concern when you're looking purely at the technicals, which is precisely the problem with all the fork-fobia that some people have. There is no good reason for this fork-fobia in reality even though from a technical theoretical perspective there may be.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:49:58
If there is a Bitcoin Unlimited fork of the chain, for me it doesn't matter how much hash power it has, I will be staying with the original chain. If that chain needs to fork the difficulty and/or PoW, that is fine as well. The model of Bitcoin Unlimited is a direct threat to the existence of Bitcoin, I simply can't support it.
The argument about the "longest chain" only matters when you have a network with compatible consensus rules. It does not matter when the rules are changed. You can look at the ETH/ETC fork for example, they didn't even PoW fork but both chains are live and fine.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:15:07
Of course.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:16:25
The chain with significant hash rate minority can also hard fork, to fix the difficulty. They may also change the PoW algorithm at the same time. I would imagine something like this to happen if certain actors attempt a 51% attack with hash rate.
@_date: 2017-01-30 00:30:45
I think summer 2018 would be OKish. I'd certainly want to see the SegWit soft fork activated first though.
@_date: 2017-01-21 01:43:50
Not accurate. With current transaction sizes the effective increase is to around 2.1MB effective blocksize.
Additionally, lightning network is *not* centralized in the same way as off-chain with exchanges etc is. Lightning hub network is highly competitive and most importantly, the hubs don't have custody of the coins. They simply process transactions.
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:53:39
You mentioned an important issue in the debate. The miners are very touchy about the Hong Kong agreement, which is a major issue right now.
The key is that SegWit was not available as an option back then. If there was no SegWit, I think a hard fork would already be on its way to activation, if not activated already. SegWit changed things, since it allowed for a superior upgrade path.
It doesn't make sense to blindly look at an agreement after which the reality of the situation has radically changed. What matters is the current situation.
And the current situation is that there is no plan for a HF, no consensus on how to exactly change the protocol, no timeline for a HF. But with SegWit everything is ready except miner support.
EDIT: SegWit was planned at the time of the agreement, but SegWit as a soft fork, and its current progress level, was not there at the time of the agreement. Which is quite relevant.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:57:43
Depends on the miners. I'm pretty sure some of the SegWit-supporting miners do hold a good portion of the coins, such as BitFury &amp; BTCC. Based on everything I know about them.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:12:46
The  thing Bitcoin needs to safeguard is the ability to run validating nodes without excessive cost. This can't be done by haphazard increases in block size. That is why block size increases need to be conservative and the fees on-chain will indeed need to be rather on the large side, not on the small side.
The way it will work is that miners get large fees per tx from the limited space, and those tx are settlement transactions for large p2p tx and lightning settlements. At the same time people can make a lot of small and cheap transactions through lightning.
Unlimited on-chain scaling simply *does not work*. It works only by dangering the very essence of Bitcoin, by creating a system where the only ones that can afford to run a node are miners and large businesses in the space. That is not the route I will support and I will not ever run any upgrade that in any way dangers that.
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:35:41
I understand that reasoning. But I personally have patience regarding SegWit, I believe there will be progress with the miners within a couple of months. A responsible hard fork would take in my estimates 12-18 months total from now to activate, I don't see it as a good way to move forward at this stage.
To have a quick relief to this situation there is only 2 options. Either activate SegWit, which can happen quickly, or do a quick HF, which is in my opinion totally unacceptable in Bitcoin. I could not support such a move.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:25:38
The "what if's" do not matter. We don't have a plan for a HF. SegWit is no longer vaporware. It can be done as a soft fork. Lightning is no longer vaporware either. We have a completely different situation and getting stuck in the past is not smart.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:15:57
Indeed. But the "what if's" of a hard fork do not matter. What matters is the situation right now, and that is the whole point of my post.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:07:17
I think the key here is to talk to the BU crowd and ask what would be sensible for them. It is quite up to them if it even makes sense to go for a plan B proposal. There are plenty of proposals out there but Core won't actually merge any of them until there is wide consensus. Gathering consensus would need to start from the big blocker crowd, since the small blockers are understandable quite strongly in favor of a SegWit soft fork.
@_date: 2016-06-08 21:09:09
Agreed. Bitcoin is in the transition phase right now.
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:26:26
A hard fork that is properly implemented in Bitcoin takes probably a couple of months to agree upon at least and then something like 12 months of lead time until activation. Hard forks are a serious thing and should not be done with haste.
This is the main reason why it makes no sense right now. We have SegWit ready to go, with no need to hard fork. That gives us a block size increase in itself that gives us 100% more capacity and also allows the use of Lightning Network in the main Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:19:19
I have read the agreement. Now I will explain the main reason why the agreement stalled. That is the fact that not all in charge of what is merged into Bitcoin Core, actually signed the agreement. It wasn't an agreement by Bitcoin Core, it was an agreement between certain individuals.
It is OK to be pissed at the individuals if they haven't followed through on what they promised, but they have no control over what Bitcoin Core does. Bitcoin Core has its own decision process which is not controlled by the agreement in any way.
This is, in my mind, the key issue. And I think it is total bullshit that "there is never going to be a block size increase, if we allow SegWit". That is simply untrue. All estimates say that for even lightning to scale Bitcoin to VISA transaction levels, we would need a much higher block size.
EDIT: Forgot an important point. SegWit as a soft fork *was not* available as an option at the time of the agreement. As soft forks are generally superior upgrade paths, this in itself has changed things drastically.
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:03:28
That's not the case. Regular people would use Bitcoin via layer-2, which is still using Bitcoin. The transactions would simply be settled in large quantities via the blockchain.
Many users don't run nodes even now, but what matters is *the ability to run them*. If the governments started really attacking Bitcoin, they could go after the miners and they could go after the businesses. 
They would have a very hard time going after a robust node network, which is easy to strenghten at any time, if there is an attack. As long as validating is not too costly. If it is very costly, defending the network from an attack is very expensive.
I think all the heavy users and hobbyists do want to run nodes to support the network. I run a personal node in addition to our company running nodes. I want to continue to run a node but if it's 100x as expensive, even I would perhaps not run one any longer.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:09:34
Miners are required, but not necessarily all of the same miners that currently mine. Bitcoin can fork to only have certain miners, and it can also switch the PoW algorithm entirely. Which is definitely not out of the question if the miners start doing things on their own.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:07:03
Not a conspiracy theory. Which businesses are claiming to run BU? Close to none. How many nodes run BU? Around 7% with total stall. The uptick in BU adoption is only visible in the hash rate, nowhere else.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:07:40
I agree that in a 75/25 split it would make no sense for the 25% chain with economic majority to do a difficulty hard fork. But what if it is 90/10? :) Unlikely though, very unlikely.
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:41:33
Right now the only backup plan that is active is Bitcoin Unlimited. And personally I think that is a stinking pile of horse shit that does not have realistic possibilities of achieving wide consensus. At what point did the reasonable block size increase plans go out of the window and people started pushing effectively removing the block size entirely? That's the point this whole debate started going to a really bad direction.
For example, there is a block size increase proposal that gives a 2MB increase at first, and then a 17% increase annually, if I remember correctly. If people pushed for such proposals, there would be an actual chance for a HF compromise. But with proposals like Bitcoin Unlimited, we're quite far off right now.
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:07:13
There are degrees to this, and that's exactly why I have no problem with a conservative block size increase. I happen to have a high speed internet connection (100/100 mbps), I would have no problem running Bitcoin with 20 MB blocks. But that would still cause major disruptions in the network due to the low bandwidth between the West and China. But I think 20 MB is doable in the future, and more, but right now it's not. There needs to be small increases that ensure stability.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:23:06
Many people, including me, would have advocated for a conservative block size increase very loudly, if the SegWit soft fork option was not available and wasn't ready. The consensus level for a hard fork would be very different. The situation would *not be* the same.
I used to be a very loud big blocker advocate at the time of Bitcoin Classic. That was a different time, different situation. SegWit is no longer vaporware, nor is lightning network. It's a completely different situation and I have adapted.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:22:08
Additionally the original chain can also fork to fix the difficulty. Or change PoW algorithm if needed. Depends on how bad of a hash rate deficiency it has.
@_date: 2016-06-08 17:25:14
It's the perfect introductory gift for anyone into the world of Bitcoin. That is the main use case. Other use cases are basically cryptocurrency coin collectors. We have lots of buyers from both areas  and we have suitable products for either case.
It's actually a lot easier to explain Bitcoin (which is basically cloud money) with something physical. The public key / private key concept especially is very easy to explain with these coins.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:32:22
As I explained in another comment to you, that route is not acceptable to me, and many others. The costs of validating nodes need to be kept in check, as that is the true backbone of Bitcoin's decentralization. That is why I see no other plausible route than increasing the block size conservatively and putting all efforts on optimizing the use of that limited block space.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:15:20
In the interim the miners have their main revenue which is the newly created bitcoins from the block reward. Not a problem in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:12:16
Yes, there is Bitcoin Unlimited, which is a crappy proposal. If there was something else proposed by the big blockers, things might be a bit different. But there is no chance of consensus with something silly as BU.
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:37:27
This is key. For miners it is imperative that the price doesn't go down. That is very bad for miners. They have to support changes that have a positive effect on the ecosystem. It's not just about what they get from fees.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:34:38
Indeed. The on-chain of Bitcoin should be a settlement network for large value p2p transactions and settlement transactions of the lightning network and other layer 2 networks. This way we can ensure the blockchain can be validated by nodes with low cost and at the same time allow gargantuan amounts of small tx with low fees in layer 2.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:29:54
I think it's irrelevant to count how many miners signal for a block size increase in general. SegWit is also a block size increase, a real increase. The signaling needs to be for a single compatible implementation, to be relevant at all. The 8MB block signaling is actually fully irrelevant as nobody are running nodes that would support such a thing.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:15:45
Miners are needed always, just not necessarily all the same miners we have now.
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:11:32
This is a last resort option, but I do advocate for having a plan for a hard fork to change the PoW. The only situation where I would potentially advocate for this is if the miners activate a hard fork without consensus from the nodes and the ecosystem (which I would consider a 51% attack). It wouldn't hurt having something ready in case things get really ugly, which I certainly hope they won't.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:09:10
This is a decent idea. But I think that the biggest bounty for miners is to keep bitcoin price up. If we continue with status quo for a long time, or a controversial hard fork is actually attempted, I would imagine the price would go down quite a bit. This is something that miners need to be educated on to understand the real bounty.
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:10:20
I considered that but I think it will be simply downvoted to hell.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:14:01
Well I think many of them do. Bitcoin Unlimited opens the block size to be radically raised, and around 16% of hash rate supports that. 25% of hash rate supports SegWit, which raises block size. The rest don't signal for anything, yet.
@_date: 2016-11-08 18:29:35
Definitely not a scam. I'm sure can explain how it went.
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:00:18
The transition to BU has in any case not helped the situation, in fact has made the division stronger.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:19:35
You seem to not get it. Signaling can be done immediately, true, but in the case of a hard fork the actual activation after signaling would have to be much further out. With SegWit soft fork the activation is 2 weeks after signaling is at 95%. With a hard fork we'd like that to be at least 6 months, if not more. Hard forks require everyone to upgrade in order to use Bitcoin at all, it's not something that can be just enabled right away.
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:30:13
Good analysis, but you forget some important points here. First of all, there is one metric that is quite relevant to miners and is relevant in this case and that is the value of 1 bitcoin.
I would say that as long as this situation continues to get worse, it will not be good for the price of bitcoin. And on the other hand, a controversial hard fork that could lead to a true split, is even worse on the price. A catastrophy.
That is the one thing miners should also think about, in addition to the metrics that you already mentioned.
Then about the hard fork &amp; timing. This would be a completely different situation if a hard fork was already planned, there was consensus on how to exactly hard fork, and a timeline for the hard fork.
Fact is, right now there isn't. And at the same time there is the SegWit soft fork, which is planned, ready &amp; a clear timeline is in place. The "what if's" of a hard fork do not help, the present situation is all that matters.
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:36:14
Yeah but that type of what if's don't really matter. And I don't agree about not fighting again... there needs to be a consensus on the on-chain + off-chain approach generally as well, and the importance of keeping the block size somewhat limited. Otherwise the fighting will continue and continue until eternity. Right now there are still fundamental differences of opinion in regards to the direction of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:43:28
If the BU crowd would advocate instead of their current proposals a conservative blocksize increase HF to be activated after SegWit activation, I think there could be a chance for a compromise and consensus on the HF. Right now we're far off, since the BU proposal itself is totally unacceptable to small blockers.
@_date: 2017-01-29 14:59:26
Likely mostly due to variance, but this is still the new all-time-high of SegWit percentage in the 144 block graph.
@_date: 2016-11-04 18:07:34
Did you guys read it correctly? He said he won't *block fixing malleability*. He did not say he won't block SegWit, in fact criticized it in the same comment.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:10:44
I'm aware of what SegWit does, but this is mostly a semantic issue. People generally talk about "raising the block size" in regards to a hard fork that simply raises the block size. SegWit goes around it in a clever way which is also a block size raise, which is true.
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:23:56
We don't need to hard fork because of this. It makes absolutely no sense when there is a soft fork option that can 1) Increase capacity by 100% and 2) Allow immediate test use of the Lightning Network which can actually solve this issue for good.
We may also need to increase the block size at some point. But it makes absolutely no sense right now.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:58:36
BU adoption is not growing. It's stalling. Only the miner support is growing, since a small but powerful group of people is putting all their efforts into it. People such as Roger Ver and Jihan Wu. Don't be delusional about this.
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:33:10
Yes, but the increase that comes via SegWit, is not problematic in itself. It has been validated by the small blockers that an increase to 4 MB, which is the maximum block size with SegWit, is not going to be a problem. Also the Chinese miners approved 8 MB previously. These type of increases are not controversial, they are in fact quite OK with current network conditions. And I support such increases as well.
SegWit combined with a 2MB block size HF is probably also still in the realm of being OK, since that would be effectively 8 MB max. But I think that is pretty much the maximum for right now, anything higher is not acceptable in the current situation. If the BU crowd understood this and abandoned the push for the BU proposal, this type of compromise would actually be possible.
@_date: 2017-01-26 02:20:36
Bitcoin hard fork right now would be MORE contentious than the ETH/ETC fork, not less. It's pretty important to understand. We're talking full scale catastrophy.
@_date: 2016-12-27 16:51:08
This. I think the idea is cool as well however I'm sceptical of the actual convenience of using these and the use cases.
@_date: 2015-08-23 17:57:43
Remember that companies also run full nodes when they are doing anything serious with Bitcoin and they will have incentives to keep them operational.
Also, BIP 101 is quite conservative even for home connections. I live in Finland and in my home I have a 100/100 mbps connection that costs 20 € / month. Unlimited. And I'm not kidding about the upload - in 2014 they started increasing upload speeds to 100.
The reason companies have started to increase upload speeds as well, is that a lot of people upload a lot of data to cloud services. This is quite good for Bitcoin as you can run a full node based on BIP 101 for quite a while with a 100/100 connection.
And when it becomes a problem in the future, I'm quite sure 1000/1000 is already available.
Full nodes can not be run with every device at every location in the world. That is now the case - and will continue to be the case in the future. However your vision of centralized mining nodes running the network is a bit alarmist, I have to say.
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:41:49
Indeed. This is not just about the blocksize issue. We *need* a hardfork simply to prove Bitcoin can evolve and improve. Right now the development is *too* conservative.

I think you misread my conclusion. I'm well aware Finland has much better than average Internet connections. I meant that there will be many places where running a full node is feasible even at home. Most likely even in your area, at some point in the future.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:09:34
Exactly. This is happening right now with Bitcoin XT.
@_date: 2015-08-24 07:33:44
Denarium ships the E series to the US. It needs to be loaded by the customer but that is easy.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:37:09
This is a good post. However, let me clarify a couple of things.
First, many of us who support XT simply feel that the Core development concensus process has become ultra conservative - too conservative. There simply isn't time to work on the perfect technical solution forever.
As for XT being hostile - that's exactly the point. Core needs some fire in its ass to work on *their* solution a little bit faster. I see XT as nothing more than a fallback. It will win if Core doesn't push a proposal of its own eventually. However if it does, XT may become fairly irrelevant.
As for Bitcoin becoming "too centralized" - I'm aware of this concern. However I'm with Gavin here arguing that neither the drop in node counts or Chinese miner situation has much at all to do with blocksize. It's a very valid problem but *completely separate*.
Additionally and very importantly, if this so called scenario of a government takeover were to happen, users can switch to another cryptocurrency. That is the fallback. Cryptocurrencies as a whole are unstoppable.
In the same way users can switch if the artificial block limit makes Bitcoin too problematic or too expensive to use. The XT crowd, me included, thinks that this is a more likely problem than the Chinese takeover. Not discounting that issue either though, I get it.

Extremely valid point.
@_date: 2015-08-21 14:55:09
Completely agree. I believe the most likely scenario moving forward is that Core actually implements a BIP that increases blocksize. Not necessarily BIP 101, but an increase nevertheless.
This would solve the blocksize issue but it would also solve, at least partially, the leadership issue. Since it would prove that Core is capable of decision making.
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:34:52
That is a very good point. Haven't thought of it that way before.

This scenario only happens in a contentious hard fork, which is highly unlikely. If all major exchanges and payment gateways are also pro-fork, it would be quite suicidal to go against it.
Investors and any smart users will back the fork that can be used and traded. Not the one backed by ideological maniacs. Trust me on this.
If there is conflict within exchanges &amp; payment services as well, then it will be tricky, as it allows for the project to truly split. Otherwise the split will be resolved quite easily with everyone from the minority simply converting to the majority chain except the ideological maniacs.
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:35:43
The reason I got really interested in your document was the EPIC trailer. Reminded me of the Zeitgeist movies which concentrated a lot on emotion. These productions must provoke significant emotion or otherwise it's useless.
I hope the movie is better than Rise &amp; Rise - we will watch it with a group during the weekend. Rise &amp; Rise was pretty OK for seeing what goes behind the scenes in Bitcoin world but it was not exciting at all from the point of view of an outsider.
@_date: 2016-02-01 13:53:57
75% is a *supermajority* but that is not the relevant part for a hard fork. Hard forks also need exchange &amp; payment service &amp; user support. Mining power is simply the only way to technically measure the support for a fork but in reality it needs other parties as well.
@_date: 2016-02-25 00:04:20
With the blocks being as "legit full" as they have ever been before, this Satoshi Roundtable is definitely needed. Also it seems to be a fairly balanced bunch of Bitcoin people, meaning that there is a possibility of real consensus and not just "consensus".

Classic fork does not fully activate at 75% activation threshold. After 75% there is a grace period which is currently set at 4 weeks as far as I know. And as you should know, full nodes will start putting out all kinds of warning already after 50% hashpower is using a different version.

Do you understand at all, what you are talking about? BitcoinJ clients could care less about the hard fork. It concerns full nodes only. However the SegWit upgrade proposed by Core does concern each and every wallet out there. Not the fork.

90%+ consensus is certainly needed *but not from miners*. Hard forks are a joint venture between users, businesses, developers and miners. Miners alone hold seriously problematic veto power if something like 90%+ is used as the threshold.

You could also choose to keep some of it in bitcoins. BitPay even allows you to set the percentages freely. That way you would get lower fees.
Even though bitcoins are a risky investment and sometimes volatile, from year to year they have been pretty much better than literally any other investment.
Often merchants take everything in coins if the volume of BTC payments is low, since the risk is still small. Once BTC volume goes up, then convert some to fiat. Or however you like, it's up to you.

Gladly this is not the final version as it will not work out very smoothly. That draft has 0 mentions, let me repeat that, 0 mentions of a blocksize increase. It has mentions of "effective blocksize increase" which is SegWit and it has a mention of improving SegWit with a hard fork.
Additionally the grace period for the hard fork is incredibly long as there is not even code yet - that is a lead time of 1,5 years total.
There is no compromise here yet compared to the position of Classic and the large amount of companies supporting Classic. A compromise would be something like a clear support for increasing actual blocksize to some number, with a grace period somewhere in between what Classic wants (1 month) and what Core is pushing for (12 months).
The only compromise here is that there is NO compromise. Core roadmap already mentions the possibility of a hard fork somewhere in the future and this simply clarifies it. It in no way is a change to that roadmap, whatsoever.
The shitstorm will certainly continue and fiercely if something like this was the final statement from the meeting. But gladly it's not.

PRESS RELEASE: Denarium Launches The Next Generation Physical Bitcoin
Denarium Bitcoin is the newest project of 3-year old Finnish Bitcoin startup Prasos. The company operates Bittiraha.fi, the largest Bitcoin exchange in Finland, and Bittimaatti, the largest Bitcoin ATM network in the Nordics. Now Prasos is making its way into the international scene with Denarium Bitcoin, the next generation of physical bitcoins.
Helsinki 10.4.2015
Mike Caldwell created the first Physical Bitcoin in 2011 under the name Casascius and this taught us that people have a clear need to identify bitcoins with something physical. Bitcoin as a concept is hard to understand if it is envisioned as something purely virtual. A Physical Bitcoin is a great conversation starter - the perfect gateway to explaining Bitcoin. There has been only one problem - cheap &amp; affordable coins have all but disappeared from the market.
– Ever since US manufacturers ran into regulation issues, low price Physical Bitcoins have been a thing of the past. Years ago I used to give them out to friends &amp; family but nowadays it’s simply not possible because the coins are too expensive. We decided that we have the expertise and the right kind of regulatory environment to bring them back and eventually we came up with Denarium Bitcoin, says Prasos CEO Henry Brade.
The coins from Denarium are designed to have easily redeemable private keys. In addition to storing the private key in plain text, it is also stored in QR code format. This way the bitcoins inside a Denarium Bitcoin are easy to redeem and spend online. Denarium products are shipped worldwide and they come in two valuations, 1/10 of a bitcoin and 1/100 of a bitcoin. Both loaded and empty coins are available.
– Asia has a number of emerging bitcoin markets with huge volumes of potential adopters. Just as in the West previously, a tangible bitcoin is a great first step into bitcoins for millions of new users, and makes the whole concept easier to understand, states Ville Oehman, who is bringing Denarium Bitcoin to Asian markets.
The pre-order of Denarium Bitcoin starts on Monday 13th of April at 12:00 UTC (London). This is 8 AM in New York and 8 PM in Singapore. All pre-order sales are done through the main website of Denarium,  First batch of Denarium coins are scheduled for delivery in June 2015.

Technically the only major difference is that the private key is also stored as a QR code. It has been tested that it works with modern smartphones even in a size that small. This can add a lot of convenience for redeeming a coin.
The biggest feature is not technical, it's economical. Denarium coins are significantly cheaper than anything out there. They are meant as a basic gift item, not as a high-end collectors piece.

This depends on the case. In some cases VC's can have a lot of power over the company, in some cases less.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:28:11
In terms of technical features, the private keys in our coins are easier to import into Bitcoin wallets because the key is stored also in QR code format. It's in line with the model of these coins being a low-cost gift item that isn't meant for just hoarding.
What is more important however is that these are low-cost gift items, not expensive collectors pieces. That is what sets us apart from anything else that's being produced right now.
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:11:16
This "investigation" is ridiculous. The same VC's back so many Bitcoin companies because only a handful of VC's want to invest in Bitcoin companies. Those that do, usually invest in many. It's a pure coincidence in regards to BIP-101.

@_date: 2015-09-06 21:29:10
Exactly. I still prefer BIP101 over BIP100, however I think they can actually be combined. The hard roof of BIP100 could be switched to scale BIP101 style. That would fix the largest issue with BIP100, the 32MB hard limit.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:23:12
You put it well. Our primary focus is ease of use and affordability. These are low-cost gift items that don't need to be "super secure".
We have premium coins on our roadmap, which will include the option to create 2-factor keys which don't require trusting us. Technically we could do this already of course, but it simply doesn't make sense for these products.
For the 0,1 &amp; 0,01 BTC coins we are aiming at being able to produce a lot of them. It's a simple product that we want to sell with a high volume. Our future products are going to be premium coins which are much more sophisticated.
@_date: 2016-10-18 16:45:19
True, it can be consumer to consumer of course. And there are no fees in those transactions. Currently only delays, depending on which bank to which the tx is going and in which country. Those delays will be gone in a couple of years as the instant SEPA policy is coming into effect.
This is why speed or cost will not be the  advantages of Bitcoin. The advantages of Bitcoin come from the sound currency first, everything else is secondary. If you have no need for the sound currency itself, you'll likely not need Bitcoin.

Henry from Denarium here. I want to correct something in this post that is quite important to mention.
Our focus is 100 % on the Christmas market and you will indeed receive your coin if you order from us. In fact we now offer complementary gift wrapping as an option at the website.
Only the 1 BTC coins will not ship before Christmas but all other products will. 
The 1/10 &amp; 1/100 which are our main products, we have available at our warehouse for shipping right away. The Custom Value coins are pre-order but they are scheduled to ship in early December and we are on schedule.

I want you to consider for one second that maybe, just maybe, Gavin is actually thinking one step ahead. Blockchain can be analysed regardless and regulators can and WILL demand blacklisting from Bitcoin companies regardless - at least this way the Bitcoin experts can have a say in what kind of regulation emerges in the future. Without this, it could be *even worse*.
The only thing I am personally worried about is the protocol / software. As long as it remains in essence what is is, then all is fine. People can choose to not use the exchanges &amp; services that have too aggressive AML / KYC. The market can and will fix that. The Bitcoin protocol is important to safeguard however.

I think that this is a VERY good idea. Bitcoin ATM's and merchant services can demand a certain type of transaction automatically, which legit users will follow. If a non-legit user tries something, he can't do much since he has to follow the rules or else his transaction will require 1-conf+.
@_date: 2016-10-18 16:08:51
SHA256 (the mining algorithm) is quantum proof but ECDSA (the key encryption algorithm) is not. However with SegWit we can actually softfork a new key algorithm and signing system into Bitcoin. As long as idiots aren't blocking SegWit from activating.
@_date: 2016-10-17 21:41:28
This is a quite one-sided statement. SEPA tx, just like debit/credit card tx, are free for the consumer but not free for the companies.
Here are the prices for SEPA tx here in Finland in the 2 largest banks (for a company):
- Transactions using the Finnish unique reference format: 0,11 €
- Transactions using the standard message format: 0,30-0,50 €
Both are used in domestic tx and only the latter in foreign tx.
Additionally it's quite important that Bitcoin is not really in the competition in fees with SEPA. Nor speed. Bitcoin's advantages lie primarily elsewhere. It's a next-gen currency, not a next-gen payment system.
At least *not yet*. With layer 2 solutions (Lightning, Sidechains) Bitcoin will become a next-gen payment system as well.

Generally not a good idea to install these machines unbolted, even though they are sturdy.
Our Lamassu's are bolted to the ground with 8 inch bolts and in some cases we also tweak the bolts afterwards with Sugru and other stuff to make them really hard to remove.
Still not impossible to do something but requires a lot of time and super professional crew. Installing them unbolted however is not very secure if the crew is smart.
Our company operates 7 active Lamassu's at the moment, by the way.

The crowdfunding platform we chose to do this with (Invesdor), albeit otherwise great, was unable to implement Bitcoin payments. 
This was 100% due to regulation issues. The financlal authorities in Finland are currently on a hunt against crowdfunding services which meant Invesdor had to "keep it simple".
To help with this issue we are offering two possibilities. First, we offer selling of bitcoins through our service at no cost to anyone who needs to sell bitcoins in order to invest EUR in us.
The other possibility is a direct bitcoin investment outside Invesdor. This option we offer only if the combined amount of bitcoin investments is at least 10 000 €. Registering an investment made with bitcoins is a bit more complicated (again due to regulation), so  the amounts need to be large for that.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:29:35
I don't know how people didn't see this coming. The whole model of 21 Inc is based on this as well, by the way. They can prioritize even 0-fee microtransactions through their own pool and they will confirm even if no one else mines them.
I don't see this as a problem by the way. What it will do though is accelerate the need to increase blocksize as delays for users not affiliated with mining entities will increase faster as Bitcoin usage increases.

Do you think it's too low, or too high? The minimum was determined based on our discussions with the crowdfunding platform, Invesdor.
Based on their statistics an amount between 200 and 500 EUR is optimal. I tend to agree. We chose 20 shares which equals 335,xx EUR with our valuation.

We currently have bank accounts in three Finnish banks and our status with them is solid. 
We have some advantages in this area compared to other companies. For instance, one of the three banks has a new policy which means that they do not open new accounts to Bitcoin companies. But old accounts are just fine. We started in 2012 and we have long standing good relations with all of the banks that we use.
In general we want to make sure we always have backups in this area. That means we need to always have multiple bank accounts.

Blockchain analysis alone is very ineffective. It doesn't take into account the fact that a lot of bitcoin owners hold their coins in wallet services &amp; exchanges where the bitcoins of multiple users can get combined in single addresses. And not just a few - in some cases hundreds of thousands of users if we're talking about certain cold wallet addresses.
Coinbase has almost 3 million users. Blockchain Wallet has over 3 million accounts. And this is just 2 services among hundreds.
The numbers in the video for Finland is based on our numbers at Bittiraha.fi. We've had over 25000 unique Finnish customers so far and even though we are a local market leader, we've figured that there must quite a bit more users in Finland generally.
@_date: 2015-03-21 18:59:39
This is true, however any company with any sanity whatsoever would require this from US based investors. In case of a public offering like this, it is actually needed to do actual checks on each US investor. Self-certified isn't enough. If it's a private offering, then the only thing that is needed is that the investor claims he is "accredited". That means "self-certified".
The reason for this is that offering shares to US investors that are not accredited is very risky. If proper checks were not in place, they can complain later to SEC and it could lead to the whole offering being cancelled.
So yes, this is unfortunately the case, however if the case was anything else it would be 1) crazy risky and 2) suspicious as hell. We can only blame US regulation for this, which is in my opinion completely insane. There is nothing similar in Europe.

It can be mathematically verified that a certain private key is part of the multisig solution, so they are transferable. Security is just reduced a bit in that case since the seller could have a copy of the 2nd key.
So those coins are most definitely better used for simply storing large amounts of bitcoin. The regular versions are more suitable for gifting, collecting &amp; selling.

It is very difficult to estimate the size of Bitcoin userbase. And it is a very different figure if we're talking about active users that pay for stuff with Bitcoin.

This is possible.
Keep in mind that Coinbase is the one and only exchange listed at Changetip to "top up" the account. They have a very close business relationship already and this "discontinuation" is NOT some sort of altruistic attempt at giving room for Changetip.
This is because Coinbase has acquired a strong position within Changetip services and from my own experience I already know that at Changetip they are reluctant and not very interested in working with other exchanges for the top up function.
Personally I'm a bit frustrated as I'm co-founder the largest news portal, largest local exchange and largest Bitcoin website in the Finnish market (for exchanging it's faster, more convenient, and significantly more popular in Finland than Coinbase) and have offered partnership possibilities to ChangeTip but they don't seem to really care.
Well, this means that as far as the Finnish market is concerned, we'll start developing/promoting something else than ChangeTip. Unless they have a change of heart. I like ChangeTip as a service, but in business sense we can't promote something that is basically a portal to Coinbase.

It's a bit of a definition issue which is the first. We had the first small demo 6.11. and a major demo 13.11. and the ATM has been in our office ever since. Now it's permanently installed in a proper location downtown.
It depends what you count as a "proper installation", I've referred to ours being the first permanent installation of a Bitcoin ATM, although that appears to be incorrect since I was reminded about the Turkish airport ATM.
The Turkish airport ATM was a proper installation and it was before ours. The Swedish one was a demo and then available "at the office" and the Slovakian one was a demo at a subway and they're "looking for permanent location".
Those are the facts, as far as I know.

A relatively easy double spend is only possible during the first 5-10 seconds. If the POS has been technically set up in a smart way, after 10 seconds it's already extremely unlikely that there could be a double spend. BitPay has seen 0 double spends so far with over 10,000 transactions, and many of them in physical locations.
Most POS interactions do happen in a way that 5-10 seconds is not enough time to vanish from the scene. If the amounts are small, it's extremely unlikely that someone would try a more complicated and difficult double spend, since it's not worth it.
On top of this it's actually possible to use green addresses to clear a transaction securely using the Bitcoin network. In this case a double spend would require that the service providing the green address commits a fraud.

Hot coins have already been blacklisted by exchange before - for a while at least. I don't like the idea of a redlist but it's not like I would love to receive really hot coins from someone.

I can't believe there are still these moronic super-idiots who are under the impression that these two raised money for their living expenses.
No. They are simply interested in the experiment as an experience and are paying for everything just as they normally would. They raised money to pay a film crew to follow them around for 3 months, and for another 3+ months of editing.

I don't agree with this. Even though the issues in China will have a massive effect, it's not a 1 to 1 rewind. The markets in other countries have also been growing, just not as fast as in China. 
It's also that people in Western countries were most likely more careful since they experienced the April bubble perhaps more strongly than the newer Chinese investors.
Now when the price reaches lower levels compared to the last high (anything below $500 basically), there will be very high buying pressure from a lot of sources.

I don't understands some of the comments. Registering addresses is not relevant and not even a problem. Users already need to verify their identity in Bitstamp etc, which effectively does the exact same thing. All the addresses you use in relation to Bitstamp are tied to you in case there were a criminal investigation.
The payment protocol coming in 0.9, which is great, allows identities to be linked to Bitcoin wallets. That will make it easier to and more straightforward to link addresses to identities, if one wants to do that.
Anything that risks tainted coins becoming different from "clean" ones is a different issue and that can never be allowed!
As for privacy, it's already destroyed if you use Bitcoin gateways with ID verification. This changes nothing in that regard. Don't use them if you want privacy.

Bruteforcing isn't necessarily the biggest problem here. It would be very stupid to have the secret scheme exactly like this, I doubt it actually is. Telling it publicly like that is not a good idea. There is however a bigger issue.
Now that people know his ring has a lot of money in it, why not extort the missing digits from him by a $5 wrench attack ( He has no plausible deniability. The ring has money, people know it, and he can't deny it. Telling about it publicly wasn't a good idea.
Always think about what you say about your Bitcoin holdings. Saying nothing gives you the best plausible deniability in case someone tries the $5 wrench attack. 
The best possible deniability you'll get by storing your private key physically in a place where you can't get without an ID check, for example a bank deposit box or a vault. That is needed only with the highest amounts and publicity though.
Even that is actually not enough in some cases. Having a 2 out of 3 key with different people is the best possible solution, then even the "kidnap a family member" method becomes not so effective. For exchanges such as Mt. Gox this method would be highly recommended.

Even though I hate to admit it, this is true. I'd say that less than half of Bitpay accounts are actually active, or have ever been used for actual Bitcoin commerce other than testing. I have some knowledge on this.
That being said, the number of active accounts might still be higher in Bitpay compared to Coinbase. And I wouldn't see this as a negative thing, you can see actual usage from their reported volume numbers which is more accurate. Bitpay processes millions of dollars worth of bitcoin transactions each month.
It would be interesting to get statistics on Bitpay active accounts but I don't know if they want to release something like that.

Even if you group all cryptocurrencies to a single index, weighted using their comparative trading volumes, you will get a similar result. That is a fact.
With the lottery comparison you make it sound like the success of investing in bitcoins is somehow random, which is ridiculous. 
Obviously it has risks, but it's the smart of the smart that have realized the revolutionary capabilities of Bitcoin, and have thus reaped profits. It's not luck or randomness, it's understanding.
Bitcoin has not succeeded by luck or randomness, period.

The lifetime of gold as a store of value is approximately 100 years from today. Asteroid mining is coming, which will push gold value way down. In fact speculators will start pushing it down even before the actual mining happens.
Bitcoin however is immune to supply changes like that. There will never ever be more than 21 million bitcoins in existence. Ever. This is one reason cryptocurrencies will prove to be the ultimate store of value.

You can build any kind of insurance and protection systems on top of Bitcoin. The brilliance of it is that you don't have to pay for them automatically.
A lot of what we pay for in terms of buyer protection is not that necessary these days. If you buy from a known reputable seller, his livelihood is dependent on a good trust rating. This goes for all companies, news of bad service spreads throughout the Internet like wildfire.
Web of trust seems to work fairly well even in an anonymous marketplace such as Silk Road, which is hard to believe. They use escrow extensively though. Escrow can be set up with Bitcoin even without specific 3rd parties, which is brilliant. That is done with multisignature transactions, although the UI's of Bitcoin wallets don't really support that yet.

No. I'm just sick of people claiming ours is not the first, when it in fact is. Get the facts straight. The Turkish airport one was a good point though, that is true.
We had demos of the ATM before anyone in Sweden, Denmark, Slovakia. We have the first permanent installation, still, as far as we know. With the exception of the Turkish airport one.
It's not a big deal, just getting the facts straight. Especially annoying when facts are countered with non-facts. Must be corrected.

What is YOUR argument? Do you claim that something just goes up and up for eternity? I don't have any basis for an opinion on short term market volatility, that is hard to predict. I do however have years of experience of the Bitcoin market alone, and there is no such possibility that it simply goes up forever without a correction.
At no point did I say that it is overvalued right now. It might not even be overvalued when there is a correction, the market is just overbought on the short term. There will be a correction EVENTUALLY, that is all I'm saying.

You're correct, however there is nothing fundamental going on that would make this "crash" any different from the the ones before it. Trouble from some governments is to be expected.

Redlist is a horribly bad idea. It only requires a small portion of Bitcoin users to start disliking redlisted coins and the fungibility we now enjoy is GONE. Redlisted coins will be less valuable than other coins, even if just slightly (depending on the amount of users/services that build blacklists based on that).
I would boycott each and every Bitcoin client that tries to add a feature such as this. If it's the reference client, the whole core dev team needs to quit. If this were to go through I would also be afraid if I was part of the core dev team. Afraid for my life. I'm not kidding here, this would be a game changer and would essentially kill Bitcoin as it is now. A lot of people would be quite unhappy.
I hope the Bitcoin community is smart and reacts to these propositions with never before seen hostility. Redlist is a pre-requirement for a blacklist and it's 100% sure that with a redlist feature some users would use it as a blacklist, thus destroying fungibility.
I know this was only a discussion starter from Mike Hearn but even proposing this deserves a very strong reaction.

3% is not a lot. I'd expect most permanent ATM installations to take at least 5%. First of all it's likely a faster method of buying bitcoins than anything else. Time is money, especially since the price of bitcoins occasionally rise quite fast.
 
The other issue for a live installation is the cost of the location, maintenance &amp; cash handling. All the cash handling should be done by professionals, otherwise the people running it are stupid.
I know some of this stuff since I'm soon installing a Lamassu machine in downtown Helsinki.

4x faster, hundreds of times less reliable. Litecoin can be overrun with a botnet so much easier than Bitcoin, making a TRUE double spend so much more likely. Litecoin can be useful with small amounts, and faster, but it doesn't offer significant advantages because with small amounts even a Bitcoin transaction is safe enough using only the announcement, and a wait time of 10 seconds.

6 confirmations is usually way overkill. Only required for $100000+ transactions. Bitstamp exchange (one of the largest) waits for 3.
For any regular amount 1 confirmation is enough. For small amounts even no conf is quite fine. Contrary to your text, most online stores accept bitcoins 0-conf, as they _should_. This is because they can check for confirmations before they ship.

The altcoins DO in fact have a real purpose that matters. They can experiment on stuff that Bitcoin simply can't. That is valuable for the whole cryptocurrency technology.
However, there is clearly an oversupply of altcoins. New ones pop up weekly, almost daily. Most of them seem to be cheap copies with small changes. That problem will solve itself though, the most boring ones will die.

To Julian and BitcoinWife, try contacting them on Twitter ( They have responded to me very actively and I don't even live anywhere near the states, I'm just supporting the project. 
I know of Bitcoiners in the US that have been in contact with them though. Maybe they are getting a ton of messages through different channels and can't keep up.
Regarding the marketing of this experiment, I have to say that I like their approach. If you're asking for money on Kickstarter these days (when it's so popular and getting crowded), you have to do it right. Marketing is everything. They have excelled in that regard, they know what they're doing.
On top of the marketing they need a good product though and we'll just have to wait and see how it turns out.

I agree that there is no way to stop someone from adding a redlist feature into a 3rd party Bitcoin wallet, existing or not existing. The reference client and the protocol is a different story, it must stay out from them.

Strongcoin wasn't such a bad option if one had a strong password. It allows some convenience that other wallets do not. Blockchain.info is much better though.
I personally had an old wallet at Strongcoin with bitcoins in it. I used my backup to move the coins once I heard about this. The bitcoins weren't compromised since I had a good password.
Users with good passwords had nothing to fear from this security leak. However it's recommended for everyone to move coins the fuck away from there since people will try to crack all accounts that have a reasonable amount of coins in them. The more coins the account has, the more effort the hackers will put into it.
This was a serious leak because you could see how many coins each account had. That puts the high value accounts at serious risk unless the password is very strong. Even I was a bit afraid but managed to move the coins in time.
