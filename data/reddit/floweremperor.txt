1. The vast majority of users do not need to run their own nodes.
2. The vast majority of users who do need to run their own nodes can either cope with 2MB blocks, or can already not cope with 1MB blocks.
Conclusion: the amount of users who need to run their own node, can do so currently, and would become unable to if the block size was increased to 2MB is vanishingly small, and the entire future of the bitcoin project is being put at serious risk for the sake of this near-zero amount of people.

Lehman's share price dropped to cents and was then delisted. It is worth zero because that company doesn't exist any more. This is a thing that can happen, and thus there is risk of stocks you own falling to zero - just like with bitcoin. What are you talking about?


Any stock's price can drop to zero at any time for no reason at all. It might be commonly believed that this is more likely to happen with a new technology like a cryptocurrency than a company, but there's nothing inherent about stocks which prevent their value falling to zero for no reason.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:11:28

Of course it can; existing holders can increase their positions, or buy back aggressively after selling. The point is that it is preferable for the price to be going up because seasoned investors are buying than if average Joes are buying, because average Joes are much more likely to sell aggressively on bad news, driving down the price, creating bear markets and scaring other new investors away. When seasoned investors buy, the price is much more resilient.

That is not true. It does physically increase the size of blocks. This is why Luke Dashjr, who thinks that 1MB blocks are too big, is against people using it until the Lightning Network is rolled out.

If we’re this reliant on one private company to help the congestion problem, something is very, very wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:37:19
That principle only works if the consumer has a choice of who to use. Users cannot choose who mines their transaction, which means that people cannot simply vote with their wallets and avoid this. If more miners did this it would be very bad for the network, and the amount of money they lose in the short term would be minimised because they’re only not mining the cheapest of transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:54:23


Which defeats your point because blocks marginally larger than 1MB have been the norm for a very long time.
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:27:22
Either a block size increase makes running a node too difficult, or it doesn’t. It’s cognitive dissonance to think otherwise. You either think the Core developers are wrong about blocks larger than 1MB being too big, or you don’t.

How is a "flood" of people with little no knowledge of financial markets being able to buy and sell (but not use) bitcoin motivated by nothing but the idea that they could make more fiat a good thing? It doesn't help adoption of bitcoin because you can't transfer your coins out of your account. It doesn't help the price because you now have a cohort of people who will sell at the first sign of trouble. This creates crashes and multi-year bear markets.
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:28:06


No, we’re talking about listed stocks. You can’t be listed on a regulated exchange without years of profitability. Here’s another example: Silicon Graphics, who made hardware and software for creating 3D graphics. Stock delisted in 2009. Blockbuster - stock became worthless in 2010. You seem genuinely unaware that companies can and do go bankrupt?


That’s a completely different argument. We’re talking about whether or not one stock can fall to zero. If you want to talk about baskets of stocks, you have to compare that to baskets of cryptocurrencies. Not just bitcoin.


And what about when the underlying business isn’t profitable? And what about companies that don’t pay out dividends?


Which may or may not happen and which can happen after the stock has already been delisted and stopped trading. That’s no different to me saying “Bitcoin can never fall to zero because of the price someone would pay to buy a bitcoin”.


Except for when their assets are less than their liabilities, which is kind of the whole point of bankruptcy.

Because if they're the type motivated by making a quick buck and aren't willing to hold through dips, they will take profit more and earlier stifling the upside, and sell aggressively in downturns, deepening the downside.


Market participants are influenced by activities of other participants. If people start selling that can influence others to sell, and vice versa. More market participants is only a good thing if you believe they will buy aggressively and hold, which would be pure speculation.

They aren't doing any of those things though. Their own wallet's GUI doesn't even support SegWit, LN is being developed by totally different teams, and they refuse to increase the block size even modestly because, well, nobody really understands why.

If miners stop mining (unlikely because there is an enormous financial incentive to do so) the mining difficulty will automatically adjust to the new amount of mining power available, and it will get easier. Easier mining would lead to more miners, and the difficulty would increase to match again. It's self-balancing.
If people stopped running nodes, it would be impossible to send transactions and the system would die. This is why nodes are so important to have a large number of. No nodes, no bitcoin.

BCH can adopt SegWit and Lightning whenever they want though. If that becomes necessary in the future, they will do it.

SegWit was a soft fork and will take years to actually achieve mass adoption at current rates. It also doesn't increase the block size to 2MB; it's more like 1.7MB.


A 4x increase to bch levels would require people to dedicate an old but still decent laptop, or run the node on their main computer, and have top tier internet lines.
Yes, but none of that means that the overwhelming majority of current nodes couldn't cope with a hard fork to 2MB.

10% of transactions use SegWit, 5 months after it was made available, and adoption is flat at best and possibly even decreasing. How long do you think it’s going to take Lightning, a much bigger and more fundamental change and which requires SegWit, to catch on?

There are fewer places that accept bitcoin for payments than there were two years ago. Adoption is going backwards, despite bitcoin hitting major mainstream awareness right now. There should be an explosion of places accepting bitcoin, and this would be the point where we finally go mainstream, but, adoption is actually decreasing. Why? Well, let's ask Valve:


Sure, they also cite volatility, which can't be helped for the time being. But it's clear that fees are hurting adoption.


So if I create FlowerCoin today, put it on an exchange and sell one coin for $20,000, my shitcoin is more successful than bitcoin because the price is higher? The entire point of bitcoin is for it to be adopted, i.e., used. Adoption is the measure of success of a coin, and the reason my shitcoin is not successful is because it has zero adoption. The block size is hurting adoption and severely limiting bitcoin's success and where it could be right now.


Nobody knows, which is why we should increase it conservatively and see what happens. 2MB, see what happens. It would solve the problem for the time being, while layer 2 solutions (which I believe will be necessary at some point regardless) are readied, and the adoption that people worked so hard to build over the years could continue. Once you lose merchants once, it's 100 times harder to win them back again.
If bitcoin exploded in usage around the world, which is what would be happening now if it wasn't for the fees and confirm times, no doubt the number of nodes would rise too. You'd lose some nodes we have now due to the increased cost, but you'd gain some due to the massive increase in attention and interest.
Right now, fees are a bigger problem than centralisation - and we are making that problem worse by prioritising not making a smaller problem worse. That doesn't make any sense.

Either larger blocks cause centralisation or they don't. You can't make the argument that larger blocks are bad while simultaneously promoting larger blocks achieved by an accounting modification instead of a hard byte limit raise.
With more people using SegWit, average block size will be larger and it will be harder to run a full node.

“Mining” in bitcoin is essentially generating a number over and over again until you get a number that matches a certain criteria. It’s called mining to make it analogous to people mining the world’s fixed supply of gold and bears no resemblance to actual mining or breaking anything down, physical or virtual. When you “mine” you’re simply racing other miners to stamp a group of transactions that have been sent to all of you with the special number you’re trying to generate.

Not to mention the fact that even if that was true, the majority of transactions being SegWit transactions with a reduced signature weight wouldn’t nearly be enough to solve the problem, especially by then.
Not to mention the fact that BCH has skyrocketed in value against BTC over the last couple of months and may very well overtake BTC in value before any of the above happens, and when that happens, it’s game over.

It’s an 8MB block size limit, not an 8x increase in transaction size. Your 1.28TB has zero basis. And you have to download the same transactions anyway; you’re just downloading fewer larger blocks instead of more smaller blocks. You’re effectively saying that because fees being so high is putting people off from using bitcoin, this is good because it keeps the blockchain download small.

Anyway, this is exactly my point. It has ceased to be about technology; it immediately descends into name-calling and insults, and people dig their heels in. No progress can be made like this and the community is driven further apart.


Nobody is using bitcoin for coffee purchases. Almost nobody is using bitcoin for commerce at all. Most people don't make bitcoin transactions other than to move money around between wallets. Despite all this, the blocks are full and fees are at an all time high. This should highlight the scale of the problem - *the blocks are full and fees are high when bitcoin isn't even being used to buy things.* It's not about coffee purchases; it's about any movement of bitcoin at all.

No, SegWit cannot ever achieve 4MB blocks. All that's been changed is that the witness data in the block counts for 25% of what it did before. The witness is just one of many things inside each block. The result of this is ~1.7MB blocks.

The first line alone completely contradicts your point. How can bitcoin be a Ponzi scheme when there is no "schemer", interacting with all participants directly?
Again: you need to spend a small amount of time reading up on what a Ponzi scheme is. Here's a start:


Bitcoin trading on regulated exchanges isn't fraudulent, there is no operator, and return isn't being generated through revenue paid by new investors. None of this definition matches what bitcoin is.
Stop repeating what you've read without understanding what the words mean.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:18:31
So the carry cost of bitcoin for four months is $18260 - $16680 = $1580? Why so much?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:33:34
If all people used SegWit, the 170,000 unconfirmed transactions we currently have would decrease by 3400 every 10 minutes instead of the current 2000 every 10 minutes.
Basically, it’s not going to make a huge difference and we’ll be back where we are now in a few months.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:42:33

@_date: 2017-12-12 23:44:43
Why does the fact that it's a poor currency mean it's overvalued at its current price? It has value beyond being currency to exchange for goods and services; it's a way of storing wealth that is impossible to confiscate or freeze, and that can be digitally transferred around the world. Even if all countries in the world announced that using bitcoin as a currency to pay for things is illegal, bitcoin would still be extremely valuable. The "it's a bubble because it's not good as a currency" argument doesn't hold water in my opinion.

@_date: 2017-12-20 05:08:52


The problem with that is that it ignores the reality that if we lose adoption it's going to be a hell of a job to get it back. If well-meaning merchants that people have fought to get to take bitcoin seriously get burned on bitcoin once they're not likely to want to return. Once bitcoin gets a reputation for being slow and expensive, it won't go away easily. This was our chance to really become a mainstream form of payment and it's slipping away, because of... the potential of the number of nodes falling if we increase the blocksize too much? Okay, so why not increase it a bit for now and if it becomes impossible to run a node and the number of nodes falls too much and campaigning for people to run nodes doesn't work and that's causing its own problems, change it back? It's just a really weak reason.

Pretty much everyone at this point agrees that we need a block size increase. Pretty much everyone, that is, except the core developers.
The problem is going to get worse and there isn’t much we can do about it, because the developers aren’t going to back down now. People aren’t even using SegWit. How much adoption do you think Lightning, which requires SegWit, is going to see out of the gate? Lightning enables every day purchases, sure, but how much is that really going to help, when the mempool is clogged now without people even using bitcoin for every day purchases?
We’ve got a huge problem on our hands here.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:37:46
How is it? There is zero incentive to actually use bitcoin at the moment. If the price was flat, I'd use it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:57:41
The reason for the split was the block size, which the BTC developers claim is a bad idea. But the fact is, if BCH need off chain transactions eventually, they will implement them. You don’t need SegWit for things like Lightning, you just need to fix malleability, which they have done in a different way. At this point I have a lot more faith in the BCH teams actually responding to and solving user problems than the BTC team which is completely disconnected from reality and will stick to their guns so as not to lose face.

@_date: 2017-12-26 09:50:23
If you look at the graph, you can see that this is more because non-SegWit transactions are decreasing than SegWit transactions increasing.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:12:39
The developers don’t actually want people to use SegWit until Lightning is ready. If you push SegWit adoption you’re going against what the developers want.

Nice theory, except that for at least a year the price has been inversely correlated with transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:17:22
BCH people aren’t opposed to layer 2 solutions eventually, they just argue that before that there need to be reasonable block size increases now. Eventually when the block size is getting unwieldy, that’s when layer 2 comes in. It’s silly to limit the block size to something so small now, which is killing the coin.

@_date: 2017-12-16 01:33:11
How do you enforce miners to do that though?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:35:03
Yes. But what I have begun to believe is that there is always going to be value in a way of being able to anonymously transfer arbitrary amounts of money to any destination in the world without permission. There will always be a use case for that. For that reason alone I think it's very unlikely bitcoin can truly die from here on out. And if an alt rose to challenge it, it wouldn't happen overnight and it would be a clear long term trend that you could take appropriate action to take advantage of.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:10:48
But the difference is that if BCH was starting to get clogged and causing problems for users, the devs would add SegWit or whatever they need for a layer 2 solution, instead of dogmatically sticking to on chain scaling for political reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:02:52
The incentive is either wanting to verify others' transactions for yourself, as bitcoin is designed to be trustless and you are then fulfilling that, or simply for the good of the project. I think you are right to question this, as node incentivisation is something that has been debated a lot before and does seem to me at least to be a flaw in the design of the system. Care was taken to ensure that miners are incentivised, by not one but two income streams (new coins and fees), but nodes aren't financially incentivised at all.
I believe there are coins that incentivise nodes, such as Stratis. Just having that doesn't mean it's going to destroy bitcoin though.

@_date: 2017-12-04 04:43:05
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:45:25
Exactly, which is why it's ridiculous to not make the small increase of a hard fork to 2MB, which would provide enough throughput to handle the current growth for the short to medium term while layer 2 solutions are worked on. The only sacrifice would be a minimal loss of nodes. Bcash wouldn't even exist if the devs had done that; the community would be far more united, people would be using bitcoin for purchases, merchants such as Steam wouldn't be going back on their bitcoin support (which is going to be very difficult and take a long time to win back) and the price would likely be significantly higher because of the increased utility. All that, for a small decrease in the number of nodes, which could be mitigated by publicity campaigns to get people to run them.
Utterly, utterly ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:22:33
And yet we believe that these same people are going to pay $30 to open a Lightning channel and figure out how to make transactions up to a certain limit and only as long as there is a route through a network between them and their intended recipient.

What exactly is this measuring and why is it increasing?
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:58:45
How does it indicate rejection? Couldn't it equally be that in those candles buyers started raising it and then the sellers won out, pushing it down towards the end of the period and indicating that they might continue to do so afterwards? Everything in TA seems to be saying this indicates X, but it always seems to me to be that it could equally indicate the exact opposite of that.

That's fine. But by calling it "Bitcoin", and calling BTC "Bitcoin Core", you are intentionally misleading people. You know this, and what's really shameful is that you're here trying to deny it despite it being so obvious. Promote Bitcoin Cash all you want, but don't call it "Bitcoin", and don't call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core". You know exactly what you're doing when you use these names. It has nothing to do with the technical merits of BTC or BCH; it is entirely about what you call the coins and the way you describe what they are to new users.
Let's say a die-hard Bitcoin Cash supporter is upset about the upcoming hardfork to 32MB, and thinks that 8MB blocks are the true Bitcoin Cash vision, forks Bitcoin Cash, somehow gains control of the bitcoincash.com domain which is top of the results when people search for Bitcoin Cash, and starts listing their fork as Bitcoin Cash (BSH) alongside the now 32MB block size chain as Bitcoin Cash Core (BCH). The website is very popular and is littered with references to BSH as an upgrade to Bitcoin Cash Core, which they refer to as "legacy", and so on. I don't think you'd think that was acceptable, would you? How on earth can you think it's okay to fork a coin and then use that coin's name for your fork? The site literally had "Bitcoin (BCH)" listed.

@_date: 2018-05-02 01:04:24
No, it's not about the scaling debate. I personally advocate for bigger blocks too. It's about the fact that you are **deliberately misleading** people who are getting into the space and who don't understand what a fork is into thinking that BCH is the "bitcoin" they've been hearing about and that that's what they need to buy if they want to get in on the action. By using terms like "Bitcoin Core" (which has never been what BTC is called), referring to BCH as an "upgrade" which misleads new people into thinking that it's simply the latest version of this bitcoin thing everyone's talking about, and so on. You're not being honest about the true nature of the situation to people who don't have a background or knowledge in crypto when real money is at stake, and that is unforgivable. You recently changed your block explorer to read "Bitcoin Cash (BCH)" instead of "Bitcoin (BCH)", so it seems that even you realised you'd gone too far in that instance. You can hold the opinion that BCH is better as much as you like, but when you mislead people, that is where you cross the line.

Any TA pattern can also indicate the exact opposite of what it's claimed to indicate. Otherwise anyone could just build a bot that's loaded with all the patterns and make easy money. 50% of the time wicks like that would precede an upward move, and 50% of the time they'd precede a downward move.
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:34:01
That only holds if the price moved down to the bottom of the wick in the period, which was then was rejected by buyers to push it up for the end of the period. How do you know that the price wasn't at the bottom of the candle for the period, and then at the end of the period sellers pushed it lower and that's how it closed?

@_date: 2017-12-13 00:06:58
But the question is - what percentage of the nodes we have now can cope with 1MB but not 2MB? It seems to me that the vast majority of potential nodes in the world either could not cope with either 1MB or 2MB, or could cope with both fine. If the block size was halved to 512KB, would the number of nodes double? Clearly not. The number of nodes in the network, which I agree is very important, is heavily influenced by a number of factors, only one of which is the bandwidth and storage required.
@_date: 2018-05-01 23:14:24

“Everything that reflects less than favourably on women is men’s fault.”
Tell me more about how strong and independent you are when mildly sceptical online comments are somehow all it takes to destroy the burning passion women would otherwise have for crypto.
Black players in the English Premier League used to get bananas thrown at them along with monkey chants when they touched the ball. Did black people in England stop playing football? No, because they genuinely wanted to play, and to this day significant numbers numbers of English players are black. Women are by and large uninterested in crypto for their own reasons, not because of anything anyone else is doing. Stop pretending that women would be here in droves otherwise. 99.99% of posts here and in other crypto communities have nothing to do with gender and yet somehow “comments like the ones here” on the 0.01% of posts that do are somehow responsible for crypto enthusiasts being 98% male? Give me a break.

They need to be run by someone. Without a large number of distributed and decentralised nodes verifying bitcoin transactions independently, there is no point to bitcoin. Without that network, it is just a highly inefficient version of PayPal. A couple of thousand tech geeks and businesses concentrated in urban areas in developed countries are not going to withstand a government crackdown. We need a network that is going to survive no matter what government in the world bans running bitcoin nodes. If the US government declares bitcoin and running nodes illegal, you are still going to be able to send transactions to whoever you want whenever you want because nodes in South America and the Middle East are verifying them and relaying them to miners. That is the point of bitcoin.


I live in Tokyo with some of the best internet infrastructure in the world and would not be able to keep my node running if blocks were 8MB. There is no way most of the people running nodes now would be able to handle 8MB blocks with the current level of bitcoin transaction traffic.
We don't need a "a poor rice farmer in Bangladesh" to run a node, we just need a decent number of guys in Bangladesh to run nodes. And there needs to be a low barrier of entry for them.

These posts scare me. If it was clear for people to see that the price is going to rise to that level at that time, the price would already be that level. That’s how markets work. Absolutely nobody in the world knows how the price is going to move. Never take investment advice from anonymous people on the internet, especially not in new, poorly understood spaces like cryptocurrencies. The price could drop below what you bought at tomorrow and never recover. It could drop to zero at any time and you would lose everything. The price fell continuously for two years from 2013 to 2015, and plenty of people lost thousands of their savings. What are you going to do when that happens again?

Because without a large decentralised network of nodes independently verifying transactions, bitcoin is nothing more than a very inefficient version of PayPal. If that's what you want, that's fine, but then what you want isn't bitcoin. And in order to get a large network that spans the world that survives when country X or country Y starts blocking all bitcoin traffic, there needs to be a low barrier to entry to running a node.

But it will be eventually, and it isn't worth damaging its long term integrity for a short term increase in usefulness. Keep the block size small, and bitcoin useless, while off-chain scaling is implemented. We want bitcoin to be around in 100 years, and in 1000 years - decentralised and impossible to hijack.

Because small players, like individuals with Raspberry Pis and folks around the world in places where they don't have gigabit ethernet and server farms, generally cannot cope even with 1MB blocks. We should not sacrifice that critical decentralisation for breathing room today, because in the grand scheme of things, today is irrelevant. We are trying to build a network that is going to take over global commerce and be the backbone of world money for the next 50, 100, 200 years. Fees being high for early adopters for a couple of years at the beginning really doesn't matter. There is no time limit and there is no rush. Bitcoin is still in the oven, and while it is a shame that you can't use it to buy coffee in 2017, you will be able to in 2018 or 2019, and thanks to that wait, in 2030 and 2040 when it's taking power away from governments and banks, nobody - JPMorgan, the Communist Party of China, the FBI, or anyone else will be able to do shit to attack or subvert it - because guys in Brazil and Sierra Leone and all over the world are verifying all the transactions.

It does now, but BCH can't scale long term. BTC can't either - that's the problem with bitcoin's fundamental design and current technological limits. The difference is that BTC has a huge team of incredibly smart developers working to make it scale long term. BCH's hashrate is controlled by a small group of people even more so than BTC is and it's only going to get more centralised as time goes on if they keep increasing the block size. It's solving the immediate problem of high fees and slow confirm times while irreversibly dooming the coin long term. It's very short-sighted.

All of those things are temporary while bitcoin spreads into the mainstream. Of course the price is going to go up (and down) a lot. Of course fees are high when bitcoin's fundamental design only allows for two of the following three properties - a large number of users, effective decentralisation, and cheap and fast transactions. This is going to be solved with off-chain scaling. And Chinese mining centralisation is something that will decrease over time as new players start to get in on the ASIC game.
[We are still in the early adopter/innovator phase]( When the internet first appeared it was a slow, unreliable, fringe technology. Now look at it. Bitcoin is new. That's why things are crazy - when the late majority gets on board things will have calmed down and stabilised a lot. Bitcoin is not going to be a perfect solution to the world's problems this year or next. But in 10 years? 20 years? The situation will be *very* different.

It is estimated that one company (Bitmain) controls 50% of the bitcoin hashrate. This is absolutely absurd for a technology the entire point and value proposition of which is that it's decentralised by design and cannot be controlled or shut down by any one entity. As genius as Satoshi was, neither he nor anyone else at the time foresaw something like this happening so quickly. It is the biggest systemic risk to bitcoin there is.
And the more expensive and difficult it is to run a node in the network, the less ability there is for the rest of the network to out-verify that company with its Chinese ASIC farms. As a supporter of the core team's vision of bitcoin's future, I looked into running a node myself and found that I simply wouldn't have the bandwidth to be able to do it. I, an individual, and most like me are unable to contribute to the decentralisation of this extremely important technology. That's with me living in a first world nation with world-leading internet infrastructure, and 1MB blocks. 
Now make the blocks 2MB. 6 months later they're full again - make them 4MB. Now 8MB. Keep going, as bitcoin keeps growing in popularity to maintain those fast, cheap transactions. Great, right? Except - what do you have now? Chinese mining farms now control pretty much all the hashrate because no smaller players can download and check blocks fast enough. What happens now if the Chinese government decides it doesn't want people mining bitcoin? Two words: game over.
The fundamental problem here is that bitcoin's original design only allows for two of the following three properties: a large number of users, effective decentralisation (to prevent some government or whoever shutting it down), and fast and cheap transactions - because of the time in technological history that it appeared. If bitcoin had appeared 20 years in the future, where everyone in the world has terabit internet connections and exabit SSDs, we wouldn't be having this debate. But now, with technology as it is, we need to come up with other ways to scale the technology so that we can maintain all three of those properties. Those other ways include - reorganising the blocks to make them more space efficient, off-chain transactions, and more. We're reworking the design of bitcoin to make it viable in an era where a 1MB block size is a big deal.
Bitcoin doesn't need to solve the fees and confirm time problems today. Humanity has survived with fiat currency for aeons and it's going to survive this year and next too. There is no rush to scale today and keep the fees low. It is okay for bitcoin to be useless for day to day transactions in the short term, because long term solutions are being worked on. In 5 years when SegWit is at 100% adoption, Lightning has rolled out and all the other enhancements that the team are working on now are in place, we'll look back on now and laugh that this was ever an issue. People will be using bitcoin in Starbucks and everything will be rosy. It's early, and we need to look at things long-term.

Bitcoin is going to change the world. Yes, the price is rising, but it isn't about that. It's decentralised banking - bank accounts and payments between them without a bank. Like Uber to taxi companies, or AirBnB to hotels. Mathematically verified, with no trust in any third-party, or any permission required. It is impossible for anyone to freeze your holdings if they don't have your private keys. It is banking for the billions of unbanked people in the world. Please read about the technology; it is so much more than just an asset to be traded and profited from.

Every node in the network has to download and verify a new block every 10 minutes, in addition to downloading and verifying transactions as they come in, in addition to uploading the current blockchain to new peers as they appear. That's how bitcoin works. Not to mention the fact that the blockchain is currently ~500,000 blocks long, and this needs to be downloaded and stored by every node. If each block is 8MB, that is *a lot* of bandwidth, and a lot of people who are currently running nodes wouldn't be able to handle that.

What convinced me was watching interviews with CSW from 2014 when he was just some random guy nobody had ever heard of, years before he ever claimed to be Satoshi, coyly saying that he'd been involved with bitcoin for a long time and mining it since before it ever had a price. He lives in London, hence the genesis block containing a UK newspaper headline. He's Australian, which explains Satoshi's use of Commonwealth English. I don't think he alone is the true Satoshi, but I think it's beyond reasonable doubt that he was involved in the early stages and probably knows Satoshi's true identity.

I go like this.
The reason you have $1000 in your bank account is because there is a chain of deposits and withdrawals from when you opened your account to now, the sum of which is $1000.
This chain of transactions, which gives you your bank balance, is stored in the bank, along with other people's. The bank can add and remove transactions as it likes, give it to the government which can add transactions, prevent you from adding transactions, and so on. This affects your balance.
Bitcoin is a public list of everyone's transactions stored together, called a ledger. You have 5 bitcoins if there is a chain of transactions  with your ID on them from the beginning of the ledger to now, the sum of which is 5 bitcoins.
Now the genius, key idea behind bitcoin is that this ledger cannot simply be modified by anyone to give themselves coins by creating fake transactions from another user, because every transaction has to be signed with a special key that is unique to that user. And before any transaction goes onto the public ledger, it is verified that it really was signed by that user by machines running the bitcoin software in the bitcoin network. This means that in order to create fake transactions and steal coins from someone, you would need to out-verify all these machines, with 51% of the total power of the network. And if you had that, you would be so rich that there would be little incentive to steal anything from anyone.
That is how I explain bitcoin. I don't particularly go into how the blockchain itself works as it's not really important to know at first. Then I move on to why such a currency would be useful. People think of bitcoin as a currency, and it is, but the key idea backing it is that your 'bank account' for this currency is stored in a public ledger, not inside a bank.
