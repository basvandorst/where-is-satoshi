Congratulations Leah McGrath on your pile-of-flaming-garbage story and the shitty methods you and your forensic specialists utilized to craft it.
I would also like to extend the congratulations to your editors and publisher, as they **dun goofed**, bigtime. 
The methods you utilized to find "Satoshi Nakamoto" were utterly retarded, you have about as much evidence that Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto is actually **the** Satoshi Nakamoto as you have evidence proving that Dorian Satoshi Nakmoto is actually the Loch Ness Monster.
The idiocy hurts, and I will do my best to avoid any of your writing &amp; Newsweek's writing in the future.

Also, programming a tablet to interface with a coke machine would be a lot more difficult I think. Raspi already has GPIO pins at the ready.

Yes, people could still transact in BTC and use that for goods/services or exchange BTC for cash in person through sites like localbitcoins.com. They just couldn't convert to fiat through banks. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:34:13
I can't envision an scenario like what you described in 3 and 4 happening - especially after the SEC and Senate Banking Committee basically legitimized Bitcoin earlier this week. I think I get what you're saying - yes, the costs (in terms of accepting bitcoin) are minimal business wise so long as the exchanges are functional. 
However, p2p is like a hydra - even if 99% of the major exchanges died, bitcoin would still be able to function and new exchanges would be created. Look at what happened to Silk Road and Napster - shut down and almost instantaneously replaced. People could also still exchange Bitcoin on a p2p basis, or move to other crypto-currencies like Litecoin, Peercoin, or any other fork of Bitcoin.

I've been thinking about a way for vending machines to use Bitcoin for awhile too. I think it's a really great way to use bitcoin on a daily basis, and would give it a lot more exposure and functionality.

They will be part of the **decentralized global currency** "magic internet money" revolution. They can accept bitcoin and convert it to fiat immediately through services like bitpay or coinbase, or they can hold bitcoin as it increases in value. They will be utilizing innovative technologies and would be one of the first (if they're a major company) to do so.  
They will also be able to conduct monetary transactions globally without having to pay bank fees or wait ridiculous amounts of time for orders to process. Instantaneous global transactions with minimal fees (.0001 is default right now I believe, maybe someone here can correct it - but the developers are in talks to make it even lower soon). 
Also, major (A) companies adopting bitcoin would drive the price of BTC up A TON. New users would buy bitcoin, and if the company chose to transact in bitcoin (and hold it) they could potentially make even more money.
Just my two bitcents.

@_date: 2013-05-10 03:43:12
You make some really great points. I embrace the experimental side of bitcoin - obviously nothing is guaranteed but there are a core group of adopters that really want to see it succeed.  I think the real challenge that bitcoin faces is the adoption of merchants/businesses accepting it as payment. I think that if we are seeing some sort of stabilization it might be the best possible thing to happen to bitcoin at this time. New adopters/merchants would obviously help bitcoin grow, and I think that stabilization would generate more potential business/merchant interest.
Just my two cents - I think it's hard for merchants to adopt bitcoin when the market is so volatile.

It's possible that actors are colluding to "corner the market" and spreading their funds to different addresses, but AFAIK there is not really any research I have found that is looking into this. I'm sure you could figure it out for yourself with enough patience looking at the transactions on blockchain. 
Also, there are ~12mil bitcoins mined at the present moment, out of a total of 21million. The 21mil mark is expected to be reached in 2140. The most bitcoin in one address is the one owned by the US GOV after Silk Road went down. They've got ~10,000 BTC

One of the biggest and best things about bitcoin is that it's **decentralized**. I think the majority of early adopters and many later adopters embrace this as part of the appeal of bitcoin. It is not a product, and though I can't predict the future, I think a centralized fork of bitcoin would be a colossal failure.
