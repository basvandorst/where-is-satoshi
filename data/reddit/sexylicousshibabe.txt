Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:36:36
Paying it forward on Youtube. We need to get changetip going on Facebook already to reach the masses
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:00:21
I salute you for standing up for people's interest
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:34:17
Thanks,ive been looking on the changetip website but i dont see where to do that. Or do i need to ask for his/her Tip.me url?
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:59:02
Oh okay. Well what i get pissed about is the circlejerky attitude,im not even promoting this alt coin i shared it here cause i thought its a funny concept and people get hostile because what? Bitcoin is the best hurr durr,if anything they shoud inform why Bitcoin is superior not get hostile
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:21:44
Next to bitcoin's old ass technology? Any "shitcoin"'s confirmation time is a lot better than Bitcoin's. I hate the circlejerky/cult like attitude here.
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:24:06
Leave that shit to 4chan,Bruce.
@_date: 2014-12-15 19:50:34
yeah just saw that,the guy below you is so disappointed and mad at me about it lol
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:43:11
Aww that's cute. Must be a hell of a date too
@_date: 2014-11-03 08:27:54
That sounds like a great idea
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:56:53
Thaaaaanks &lt;3
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:02:48
Lol the baby's face is awesome
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:27:08
hit me baby one more time
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:51:21
You lot are amazing,this looks like a fun and nice community to be with. I'm kinda new to crypto currency and i dont have the hardware and knowledge to mine my own. I can't wait to see what the future of Bitcoin will be,if it get stable im sure it'll be better than other services and probably will kill Paypal and the likes.
@_date: 2014-05-19 15:19:53
 Yep i was thinking the same thing,i want to get my girlfriends into bitcoins but i really dont know how to convince them
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:31:46
fuck tech bullshit lol im a regular user so not everyone "realize" that. I call it what i see it
@_date: 2014-10-16 07:29:31
If you happen to log in on that pishing site immediately change your Poloniex and email password
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:31:53
Awww sweet,how did you explain bitcoin to her though? lol
@_date: 2014-11-07 11:50:15
Changetip working on Facebook already? If so tipping over Facebook is going to be HUGE
@_date: 2014-05-17 05:50:44
no no no, 1 doge = 1 doge,and you pronounced Doge wrong,its Doge not Doge lol jk +9.8 doge verify ^vroom
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:14:55
In the famous words of Mr. Rodney King "Can we all just get along?"
@_date: 2014-10-21 09:22:53
can you give me power? 
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:08:55
That's a good theory lol But no one knows for sure
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:58:23
Diversify and accept bitcoin as a payment
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:13:07
I hope this is the start of a nice run and mass adoption! BTW i dont think the tip works but thanks anyway :) Let's be a part of the revolution
@_date: 2014-05-16 00:50:36
Wow! You're so nice &lt;3 thanks for the beer. And yes bitcoin need to reach more women,women usually are not good at technology but if we can introduce bitcoin in a simple way like coinbase giving freebies,they'll sure love it
@_date: 2014-12-15 19:50:04
can you please accept my apology? you seems mad i misread it,please dont be upset :( im really sorry 
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:35:13
It worked for dogecoin,i don't see why it wont for Bitcoin. The tipping made dogecoin imo
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:34:51
That is just plain ridiculous!
@_date: 2014-11-10 12:32:26
I'd love to watch that Big Bang Theory you just described lol it will be awesome
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:59:02
You misspelled @_date: 2014-11-21 15:04:19
Idk why its deleted,is this subreddit turning into a BitcoinTalk like forum?
@_date: 2014-10-14 15:10:12
what exactly do you do?
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:23:04
I dont get it lol
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:09:11
Yeah i read it here

This idea is great
@_date: 2014-08-09 05:56:29

@_date: 2014-06-19 00:42:24
Yep and add more assholes and circlejerks lulz
@_date: 2014-05-15 12:47:06
Wow people actually tip here! So nice of you thanks. My first bits &lt;3
@_date: 2014-05-16 13:19:10

@_date: 2014-05-16 08:57:42
If only i'll get paid 1 btc for every circle post today :P
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:25:10
you created that sub sir?
@_date: 2014-11-25 13:14:11
Okay  it is then lol
@_date: 2014-06-05 18:10:04
IDK how but congrats on the coming baby! Wishing wifey and the baby good health and a safe delivery. I hope the delivery is as fast as a bitcoin tx.
@_date: 2014-06-09 17:52:52
No one can disobey the dalai llama
@_date: 2014-11-07 04:40:29
Hmm i wonder why will they do that? Do you think it has anything to do with the rumor that some company is interested on buying dogetipbot to integrate on their websites? I'm not sure but i think i read it somewhere.
@_date: 2014-05-16 13:08:26
Thanks for responding,that's why i posted it here to ask for opinions,though a friend told me its legit and paying so im tempted to invest a little. But it does sounds good to be true. Thanks again for your answer
@_date: 2014-06-03 03:10:20
Do we have to compare orange and apple again?
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:17:52
Interesting point. Thanks
@_date: 2014-10-16 12:33:21
Can anyone confirm?
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:10:59
yea why will someone store a few a hundreds on a tipping app anyway? its not a wallet to store your wealth lol
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:04:10
Woo! I can finally a book on that site now :) Thanks
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:02:38
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:14:20
And apeshits,pure apeshits!
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:01:30
Nah not me,im smart enough to ask
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:40:11
Maybe..but at least i dont circlejerk or worship something. Wether you like it or not Bitcoin can learn a lot of things from all this so called "shitcoin" so dont act like Bitcoin will stay on top of this crypto world forever.
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:51:56
Great! Thanks,Shaniqua lol &lt;3
@_date: 2014-11-06 13:46:37
I got like 200 bits 
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:33:14
What exactly is tipping Tuesday? I dont reddit that much lol Is it like a tipping war/PIF?
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:25:03
How do you calculate bitcoin transaction fees?
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:29:54
What do you want me to draw? 
@_date: 2014-06-02 11:15:25
There's no harm in trying :p
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:27:43
Is this legit? Id like to earn some btc but i dont want to get a bunch of malmares and spyware lol
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:42:06
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:35:07
Hey ^thanks again truios! You're on a tipping spree &lt;3
@_date: 2014-05-20 05:29:17
Because Mighty Ducks lol :p
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:25:56
Idk for sure but perhaps because of all the tipping going on right now thats why the update is slow
@_date: 2014-12-18 10:48:14
its 1 year already??
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:20:38
I totally agree with you,not all people can understand the system and even if they do,its still terrible. Reasonable? Perhaps,but unacceptable to most people.
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:45:53
Lol it's alright sir it's still bitcoin well spent :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 13:38:55
Wow awesomeness! You almost literally took your bitcoins to the moooon lol
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:52:19
i dont mind getting random spare change lol
@_date: 2014-11-10 12:28:50
Add  on twitter,tweet to the chick and mention  with the amount or tip monicker you want to tip.
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:59:35
How did you triggered changetip if you mention a tip code in a separate line as You didnt mention changetip on the same sentence or line as the moniker.
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:51:51
Bitcoin is always great &lt;3 Sharing is caring,spread the love and tip it forward like it's supposed to.
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:00:33
Fuck :( i guess the dude fooled me :( 
Edit:5.60m hashrate and my pool is on hashcow if those details help. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:57:30
Haha never loan to fund your investment. Great infos you got there. Thanks so much and thanks for the tip! Yay! 
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:50:16
Not everyone is as rich as you :)
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:59:00
You misspelled @_date: 2014-06-18 04:28:25
Nah,this is the perfect section for hate comments anytime you post something against their opinion or interest,which is only bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-21 13:58:13
Taking nothing away from the coinbase tipping button but i still think is still far ahead of the game
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:21:42
Looks like Changetip can't keep up with all the crazy tipping today lol
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:03:21
@_date: 2014-08-20 11:04:06
Be careful you're on r/bitcoin! 'Round here they dont like those kind of statements! I told you not to go here!
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:52:06
Hey fellow shibe! I'm also new here from dogecoin and these people are awesome so far &lt;3
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:24:15
ooohhh busted!
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:30:27
you dont lol you can earn like up to 100k sats per week tops,thats from all the faucets you have lol 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:46:19
almost all jobs require IT skill i dont have lol oh well... thanks for the info though :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 11:30:38
Thanks you! Changetip is so much fun!
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:13:16
BAZINGA! :p
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:41:01
Lucky you :) Wish i'll get changetipped too :D
@_date: 2014-11-22 06:18:46
So upon studying that statistics its more like a campaign from Changetip then? Not actually people getting suddenly excited about Changetip? Whatever,it was awesome and it sparked something :)
@_date: 2014-06-13 05:26:09
Atheist believe that Satoshians are their biggest nightmare lol
@_date: 2014-11-07 11:32:07
I'm going to double it up and give you $20 private :)
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:12:19
Im with you sis,if only Bitcoin will be introduce to more women im sure as hell it'll be more mainstream. Most ladies love to gossip lol sorta
@_date: 2014-11-22 15:55:42
If only every bitcoiner here and in general have your kind of attitude :) Glad someone share similar feelings in regard to this subreddit
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:14:33
Hey happy cakes day and thanks for spreading the changetip love. Kudos to everything you are doing for Bitcoin and Changetip :)
@_date: 2014-11-20 04:15:45
Too many gift ideas,not much bitcoin :(
@_date: 2014-06-04 04:58:21
Bring on the test! Im hoping ill get Rachel 
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:27:46
lol so true its all ive been seeing today
@_date: 2014-06-02 05:53:04
You really must know that guy,he keeps following you here
@_date: 2014-11-25 12:24:50
That's they are *trying* to do, we will call it  :D
@_date: 2014-11-14 18:20:19
I like Ben and how politely he ask serious questions. This is very interesting and i hope it gets cleared ASAP
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:18:56
good guy ard3n
@_date: 2014-10-30 09:24:05
I could use some bits :) thanks for spreading the love
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:35:23
how did you accidentally googled bitcoin? lol
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:39:24
I'd like to see someone call it for 300mBTC! We're watching
@_date: 2014-06-27 03:21:53
This is awesome this should be a  subreddit,someone make for stories like this
@_date: 2014-05-19 03:46:15
Very vroom though lol
@_date: 2014-05-24 05:33:33
you dont need to confirm a tip everytime,just a one time registration. I guess you dont tip much?
@_date: 2014-11-03 11:25:24
why is btc on a steady downtrend? now getting your first 1 whole BTC is not that exciting lol
@_date: 2014-06-02 06:03:53
@_date: 2014-06-09 04:00:05
Marry her! 
@_date: 2014-05-19 11:44:01
Seconded sis,i like wine too
@_date: 2014-05-17 07:20:33
How does altcoins affect bitcoins in any way though? If it does
@_date: 2014-05-19 12:23:03
She'll probably stop me at number 2 lol
@_date: 2014-06-02 07:28:16
I love me some wine but a nice beer tonight will be nice.
@_date: 2014-11-08 13:45:45
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:55:40
Let's see who'll be able to afford that much doge
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:28:35
Im fairly new to cryptos in general,got introduced to doge and now just learning bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-16 13:46:58
on the davidnews.com link above though,some people claim they're still getting withdrawals. Tempting but i think i'll decline
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:02:27
Back when batteries dont drain so quick :/ Good 'ol days
@_date: 2014-06-09 05:39:20
Don't scare us with the 51% lol
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:30:39
I only have three. I guess I'll never fit in :(
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:20:51
Changetip just redefined awesomeness :) Imagine how many new people it brings to Bitcoin from this event? Really nice to have new people have that "feel" of "owning" Bitcoin (bits)
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:26:50
Have 1 satoshi on me for being a bitcoin troll :p
@_date: 2014-05-17 04:45:13
**I care**
@_date: 2014-05-16 13:21:35
Thanks for the advice,i just read 's link and decided not to risk. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:34:14
┗(°0°)┛ 
@_date: 2014-05-16 09:55:33
yeah,no bitcoin for us :(
@_date: 2014-06-05 01:20:41
This just in: 50 cent kicked Lloyd Banks out of G-Unit because he  said he now hates *banks*
@_date: 2014-06-05 18:21:02
My friend's neighbor's friend's uncle is the President of the Internet and he said Paypal sucks.
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:25:35
I dont think the tip worked but thanks anyway lol And you're welcome :) Lets make this community even bigger \m/
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:55:26
is getting more accepting and nice contrary to popular belief :)
@_date: 2014-11-04 05:34:01
Now if every one of his subscribers will do the same there's no way he'll jump into the bitcoin wagon lol
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:26:30
Thank you! We need to stick with bits,the decimals kinda threw people off i think lol
@_date: 2014-05-19 17:06:56
Hehe ill give you a virtual hugs and kisses too :p
@_date: 2014-10-16 10:03:43
No problem,the site looks exactly like the original so i wouldn't be surprised if anyone falls to this phising scam
@_date: 2014-05-31 08:54:46
Thanks! I dont really mind that confirmation message lol
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:46:24
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:30:42
I mean reasonable in sense that transaction fees are calculated like that. But very unacceptable and a very terrible system for me. I like it upfront
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:12:28
Yes finally more people are using bits :)
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:57:42
Time to shave the beard Julian 
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:51:20
You can take the mod position if you like :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:33:32
Yea but i don't have an idea how we can integrate a decentralized tipping app on social medias. We might as well have a decentralized exchanges too so we stopped getting robbed lol
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:28:17
Looks like a ref link as well,not that i mind but just want to know if its legit
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:44:22
But almost 99% of people in crypto hates BitcoinTalk now. It's a cesspool
@_date: 2014-11-03 15:06:19
its not gonna happen because im buying it all at $0.00003 lol
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:22:00
How does one get infected though? I have $3 dollars worth of bitcoin on my laptop i want to protect lol
@_date: 2014-11-21 15:11:50
Thermos going cray cray lol
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:21:46
Ha! Looks like Changetip can't keep up 
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:24:22
See for example im in a store that accept bitcoin i can just pay from the tip you just gave me lol. Isn't that nice if one day it'll be so common
@_date: 2014-11-20 18:33:57
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:22:31
troll harder
@_date: 2014-11-06 11:29:23
Heh It's actually funny
@_date: 2014-05-15 10:54:01
Waiting for the day i get a change tip lol it must be awesome having my first tip
@_date: 2014-11-04 07:46:52
I'm loving this Bitcoin Christmas already lol 
@_date: 2014-11-11 04:39:14
Yea no matter how we dislike it that's still the best place to spread news faster and almost instantaneously with just a few shares
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:41:56
lol looks like it triggered a dollar tip not $0.50
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:23:00
I dont want the labor pains,i just want the baby lol
@_date: 2014-11-10 12:05:42
This true,we need bitcoin to be "idiot proof" for mass adoption with non tech people like me
@_date: 2014-05-16 08:55:36
Clicked and installed,now what?...also why is my computer screen blue? :3
@_date: 2014-05-24 05:52:57
lol asspenies :D
@_date: 2014-05-16 03:09:28
I'm already introducing bitcoins to my friends,as a female i know women dont like getting into yhe technical aspect of things so i have to explain it on layman's term. More industry need to accept bitcoin as a payment,that way i can tell my friends "Do you know you can buy shoes and bags using Bitcoin?" 100% guaranteed the demands will soar lol i dont know,just my opinion.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:09:54
I wonder what the other hand is busy of heh
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:05:55
Did you see my edit? Well i guess i'll just charged it to experience eventhough that's all the btc i have. Stupid me
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:24:05
Leave that shit to 4chan,Bruce.
@_date: 2014-05-16 12:32:42
why will anyone refuse something given to them free? a tip is a tip so be grateful,be it 1 satoshi,it just means you're appreciated :)
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:12:55
Im curious about his identity as well. I wonder why he is doing it for,would be very nice if he can share us his thoughts
@_date: 2014-11-20 19:03:05
Hey thanks so much! Im going to pay it forward &lt;3
@_date: 2014-05-23 13:14:20
stay calm,you can probably restore it so no need to panic right now :) many kind people here are willing to help so try their solution first
@_date: 2014-05-30 04:57:56
Thanks! &lt;3
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:02:18
The fuck??
@_date: 2014-06-02 07:23:57
Now kiss!
@_date: 2014-11-06 12:18:14
Changetip is the future of micropayment
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:01:39
Damn i need to acquire bitcoin now then for my future education :(
@_date: 2014-05-19 12:17:07
damn birthday cake for 56mbtc whoa! i wonder if anybody ever tipped that much 
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:11:20
Well using change tip you have the option to create own tip monicker with a corresponding amount. Say you created a tip monicker "pizza" and price it at 500 bits then changetip will tip the person 500 bits 
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:52:56
Thanks cats,some bitcoiners tend to be mean specially to us from But i think is a cool community in general. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:29:28
Oh ok,gotcha. And thanks for the tip! &lt;3
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:33:00
Lol yeah where is the text? Did you gave your bits all away?
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:47:37

I think i tipped you $40 :(
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:32:47
Yea OR you're trolling from what ive seen on your profile lol Its cool though. If changetip is attracting trolls,it only means its doing something right :)
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:10:15

@_date: 2014-05-23 14:04:14
Thats just heartbreaking seriously :( I collect from faucets to maybe have  enough in a year for my education so i dont have any investment aside from entering capctchas. To hear that its for your kids future is just so sad :( I hope somebody can help you,stay strong please. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 12:10:29
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:05:25

what does private mean?
@_date: 2014-05-19 03:37:03
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:29:02
You need to set your default currently to USD on your changetip account first before you can set custom monikers
@_date: 2014-11-03 11:50:45
Does shorting bitcoins affects its price?
@_date: 2014-05-16 09:49:28
Those look delicious,cant wait to have a good amount of bitcoin to get some myself mmmm
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:47:55
Very well explained,thank you!
@_date: 2014-05-19 05:18:57
Will we ever get invited? :(
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:09:46
How many confirmation on the blockchain? It usually doesnt take long
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:27:31
I'll code it for you...hold my beer
@_date: 2014-11-19 12:33:41

Thanks steveds123!! Gotta love Tuesdays :)
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:14:08
 
@_date: 2014-05-19 03:12:43
r/dogecoin introduced me to cryptocurrency and now im trying to learn bitcoin too. For bitcoin to be fully successful it need to be understood by common people,im one of the common people. It need to be understood and accepted by us not just the geeks. It have to hit mainstream IMO
@_date: 2014-06-19 18:28:12
Damn. Lesson learned the hard way :(
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:23:07
Can't wait to hear a news about the first person to bail out of jail using Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:27:09
It's getting viral already but we need to make this even more viral!! Changetip is addicting ( in a good way ) heh!
@_date: 2014-05-19 12:10:29
Oh ok,kinda expensive for tipping then lol beer is fine too anyway lol :P
@_date: 2014-05-21 04:54:39
I only got 0.01 btc and im already excited right now lol
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:08:52
Im starting to get used to it too
@_date: 2014-08-15 11:36:06
I think Bter and that hacker did the right thing.
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:44:21
Tipped $10 one time: Got tipped $4 once. I pay it forward anyway
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:56:58
Did you cum faster than the confirmation time? lol jk :p
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:40:13
Lol that's a joke :p im not good with programming but someone here should and will +10 doge verify
@_date: 2014-05-24 01:16:22
rich people
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:38:55
First learned about dogecoins,now trying to learn more about bitcoin,i dont see any problem? And i thought the username is already a giveaway
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:32:16
Wow that was generous
@_date: 2014-09-03 17:53:40
everybody else get their invite already?
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:06:18
I'm already convinced! Yall are amazing,im kinda new to both reddit and crypto currency and im loving both already. Thanks a lot kind sir. I never thought the feeling of having an actual Bitcoins (bits) is this great lol
@_date: 2014-11-12 12:00:08
Nice work! Did you sold at $5? lol
@_date: 2014-05-21 13:36:14
Julian Assange aged so fast in a short period of time
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:02:10
I bought some every now and then,solving captchas from faucets,doing surveys and some from tips. I guess ill just buy some again when i can. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:43:13
how do i cross post it there?
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:49:42
wrong tip format :/
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:42:57
Lol thanks
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:57:30
Yep,it has a psychological impact on the receiver that somehow a thousand bits is more than 0.0001 bitcoin lol
@_date: 2014-05-17 01:29:16
I did my research and sadly they have more bad rep than good so yeah its a no go. Thanks
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:06:24
I might check it out sometimes. Thanks,here take some of my sexy doges +6.9 doge verify
@_date: 2014-09-20 14:43:17
I was tempted to sell my cat yesterday just so i can get some cheap bitcoins lol
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:22:12
Perhaps you are right,but this is the internet. You shouldnt even expect getting tipped by random strangers right,its not like i offered a service and then get tipped with a penny ill be really pissed lol
@_date: 2014-06-06 03:14:05
Plus the conversion fee if you have a non USD account. That's just ridiculous
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:22:05
Im on it
@_date: 2014-08-15 12:20:44
OH,so i guess Bter loses on this deal 
@_date: 2014-06-20 01:06:39
I want to earn some bitcoins so i thought of "investing" on mining rentals. If only this place have been helpful to people new with cryptos :( i wouldve never made that stupid mistake
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:41:33
lol did you just give him an egg? :D
@_date: 2014-06-06 07:45:07
What said,i also forgot to mention the landing fees when you withdraw from paypal to your bank account.
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:34:25
OP you have a lot of hatred in your heart,go watch some Mighty Ducks.
@_date: 2014-11-28 14:24:07
Yes im having a major problem...no bitcoin to spend for bitcoinblackfriday 
@_date: 2014-05-23 03:45:19
Bitcoin noobish here. Thanks for the helpful infos. Specially on the wallet since the full bitcoin core doesnt quite work fine for me
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:46:54
I'm sorry,i didn't know about that. I'll keep it anyway in case some people haven't seen it yet if that's ok? 
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:17:09
Good to see r/bitcoin making peace with other alts lol Seriously that will be awesome if we can all get along :) So we can focus on moving forward
@_date: 2014-05-19 14:28:21
404 not found :(
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:56:57
This. Although i have had some issues with Paypal in the past but the integregation is going to be huge for Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-10-16 13:04:12
Scammers are getting smarter nowadays lol
@_date: 2014-06-06 08:03:34
I have a business account too and my bank charge me a landing fee everytime i transfer money from paypal,its my bank though not Paypal who charge it. I'm dumping Paypal as well,hit me up how the carrier pigeon works for you and i might use it as well :p
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:05:48
I honestly can use some free BTC right now :) Things are tight lately
@_date: 2014-05-19 05:21:02
changetip is awesome! the tipping in bits make bitcoin more understandable for the laymen
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:14:53
Lol i didnt know itll come out like that,didnt know hashtag will fudge it up
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:58:46
Lol i thought it was Satoshi's neighbor :p
@_date: 2014-05-22 02:40:52
That pizza story always amaze me. I wonder how Laszlo feel about it now? But then again im pretty sure he's set
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:56:03
Awesome! Saving now to purchase some soon 
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:52:27
Thanks :*
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:45:35

@_date: 2014-05-23 17:27:08
You have some balls of steel sir to invest that much. But i like how you look out for your family and friends
@_date: 2014-11-06 08:43:34
Oh my bad,did'nt read the OP lol
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:54:04
Ha! I want a granny like her :p
@_date: 2014-05-20 04:52:33
to^the^effin^moon 
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:29:56
Just a tip though if you want to invest on crypto currency,just invest what you can afford to lose
@_date: 2014-06-06 07:59:24
Neat app! But i think there's a fee for every transaction,like 100 bits.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:06:21
Great idea to promote Bitcoin to the mainstream,perfect target too. I'd tip you Bitcoin but im kinda new here myself so take my dogecoins +10 verify 
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:59:34
Who the hell is Professor Bitcorn and why should we listen to him at all?
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:26:15
Oh ok i saw it there i think 500 bits on me for clarifying :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 04:24:48
Would be really nice if we can already tip on Facebook. Once they have Changetip integrated there it's inevitably going to blow up
@_date: 2014-11-07 11:51:33
Hodler what a nice name. Thats what we should do with our Bitcoins too,we should be Hodlers lol
@_date: 2014-05-16 11:29:11
Sweet! How did you earn it though? Im trying to get myself a hold of a single whole Bitcoin. Obviously i can't afford to buy it though 
@_date: 2014-05-23 07:23:06
Thanks! &lt;3
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:41:44
I saw belgian and i said to myself "damn i want to buy a belgian waffle with bitcoin right now" lol yea,im hungry
@_date: 2014-11-22 12:06:21
I believe its because and +is having some sort of competition,in a "healthy" way of course ;) And dogetipbot is pretty transparent with their statistics.
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:36:21
i heard he is satoshi nakamoto's colon lol
@_date: 2014-05-15 16:38:04
Is satoshi and uBtc the same? Much confused :3 I'm new to bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-20 12:04:53
I'll definitely check that out,specially now that my month long survey and faucets earnings are gone lol
@_date: 2014-11-07 11:31:33
I'm going to double it up and give you $20 private :)
@_date: 2014-11-07 06:45:06
Spread the bits! You're officially infected with Changetip Fever lol
@_date: 2014-05-24 03:14:00
**shit just got real**
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:26:20
My only concern is **NOT** having a bitcoin :p
@_date: 2014-11-21 07:11:21
You sir is a good gentleman by heart. Stay positive and keep atracting positive vibes. Its not how long the journey is and how bumpy the roads are,it will all be irrelevant once we reach our destination :) This post makes me happy and positive. I dont have much myself but i make sure to make people less fortunate than i am be positive in life as well
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:44:59
Nevermind i already did :) I really believe once changetip makes it to Facebook that will be the game changer for both Changetip and Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:44:17
That must suck :( I know how hard it is to earn bitcoins from faucets,i wish i can tip you some but i mostly rely on faucets too. I'm using Multibit as my wallet to but let's just wait for the experts opinion
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:29:59
Yes you are :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:55:49
The rise is inevitable methinks
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:27:29
You start getting technical on women they'll lose interest lol tell them you can spend it on cash and they'll suddenly get all excited to aqcuire it :p good for you,its working out great
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:29:43
Happy cake day. Really a good present if you have enough bitcoins, i dont feel rich yet with my 0.0003 btc lol enjoy your day. Cheers!
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:29:24
Much like the uprocket on dogecoin. That'll be cool
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:32:30
Lol i could use a beer right now :p This is pretty exciting,i don't know why its not trending on twitter yet lol
@_date: 2014-11-25 15:20:26
And the moral of the story is DONT USE ICQ lol kidding aside,i feel sorry for your loss. Shit happens
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:07:51
@_date: 2014-06-30 03:54:06
I agree,he does have some valid arguments
@_date: 2014-06-20 01:34:07
Because i CANT buy thats why i tried to find ways to gain more from what i have. I tried a few times posting here for questions but since i first learned about dogecoin im automatically a "troll" sorry to break the news but this place wasnt really kind to new people :( oh well,lesson learned
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:39:42
You know you like it ;)
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:56:30
Yeah i just find that out too :( looks like i already ran dry from last tuesday tipping on YouTube lol
@_date: 2014-05-19 03:26:16
Hey thanks. This tipping makes it easier and more fun to learn bitcoins lol tipping in bits is revolutionary to reach the masses :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:56:19
Go to changetip then on click on tipping and on the drop down menu choose tipping amounts then monickers
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:53:26
Idk,plus some of us just love paying it forward. And thanks for the tip! &lt;3 i think i saw you tipped someone an egg though lol
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:08:25
Thanks kind sir! You have a great day ahead and stay awesome!
@_date: 2014-06-30 03:50:36
Even a broken clock is right twice everyday.
@_date: 2014-11-10 10:48:26
It really WILL happen and it will be freaking sweet!
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:09:15
when is the next changetip pump? lol
@_date: 2014-06-02 09:56:22
Im using MultiBit,what's a better alternative?
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:42:23
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:24:47
Its ok for me,be grateful for whatever i receive,its the thought that you get tipped not how much you got tipped :)
@_date: 2015-03-12 05:16:38
the problem is i have nothing to destroy lol 
@_date: 2015-02-04 10:12:58
im still chasing my first million satoshi lol congrats btw
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:22:41
