Can you feel it though? The tide turning? 
The fork is a demonstration of Bitcoin's greatest strength imo.

He is talking about the thing that ends in XT that must not be named.
I'm right there with you buddy!

Thats like magic

funny that

you can't find it because it doesn't fit the mods or the "core" dev agenda.
BitcoinXT is an alternative client, not an altcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:35:38
Trying to brand an alternative client as an altcoin is so disingenuous, nothing you have to say has any weight.

I brought that up too, but it's already been deleted here.

well now that there is code allowing people to run nodes with big blocks, people who want to may now do that.
For them, and myself, the debate is over.

I bought ~900 BTC in early in 2012. I had to take out a loan to do so. The investment was about 6k usd.
Over the next year I continued to accumulate, and I'm sitting at around 1800 BTC now.
I was able to convince my father to put in $10k when BTC was $6, and eventually, dump his inheritance into Bitcoin when it was around $25, and I'm proud to say it was that purchase of $100+k that pushed BTC to $26 for the first time since the 2011 crash.
So between my Father and Myself, we had on the order of 8400 coins.
My father is charitable man, and gave a portion of those holdings to his immediate family. Unfortunately -and against my advice- he has sold a great deal of the stash he bought with $10k and now has something like ~400BTC.
But even at that, his 400BTC far outstrip his original inheritance. I remain steward over the rest of his coins and my own, which has basically turned into a family trust at ~4000BTC.
I have basically turned myself, my dad and his immediate family into millionaires. And I didn't even graduate high school.
