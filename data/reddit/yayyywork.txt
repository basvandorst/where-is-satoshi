On the plus side BONY is about the most incompetent company I have ever had the experience of working for/with. That company is just a complete disaster.

Carl Mark Force IV looks so much cooler. Literally the name of an Arnold character in some futuristic dystopian action flick.

No comment on their opinion on Bitcoin, but ZH is generally looked at as a joke and the articles are generally written by people with little understanding of finance/global financial system. They tend to constantly write end of the world type articles, and their readership (who is generally not particularly financially literate) eats it up because it "sounds right"

No, which means lowered margins. If sales increase due to lowered price enough to overcome that lost marginal revenue then there is no issue. Margins are only part of the story with earnings.

Yes, an option would be saying that if the price reached the strike price the other party would be able to(or be required to) purchase at the designated price. Not sure if this is set out as an exchange where IG Markets acts as intermediary or if its just OTC. OTC you would have the risk of the counterparty not coming through, exchange you would only have to worry if IG Markets went under.

This is what should happen. The fundamentals behind why BTC are at that price still stand. The only fluctuation would be that of any new money coming in to Gox through Dwolla. I would have been rather shocked to see a massive price drop on this news. Especially until further details come out, panic selling would be rather silly.

That was a stupid tip, anyone who believes corporate executives should be able to move stock out of their portfolio before you (typically due to their lack of ability at doing their job) clearly buys into that efficient market hypothesis nonsense. Ironically all the professors who write those ideas sit on the boards of companies, of course they seem to think insiders should be able to trade on nonpublic knowledge. Funny how that works isn't it?

Wait so pouring in all your money at one time based on the opinion of random people on the internet isn't how you are supposed to invest? 
This would have saved me some frustration in 2000, 2007, and 2013.

It is rather easy to say that a sudden MASSIVE spike in demand, driving the price up, with a relatively stable/unchanged fundamental story is an easy definition for a bubble. 
There are a lot of people buying BTC right now for the sake of having bitcoins thinking they will never go down. When the prices flatten out, drop a bit, a lot of those people will rush for the exit.
There are great reasons to hold BTC long term but short term I think it is pretty reasonable to think a correction is coming.

My favorite thing ever is to hear people who blame negative actions of a group in Finance on regulations. Its very comical.

They went Electro/dub then dropped most of the dub and not just play electro &amp; progressive. I personally like KP better but there are some amazing Pendulum tracks

At this point it seems more like this is just an information request as the regulators do not know much about bitcoin. If it were a large financial organization they would just call them up or have a meeting. With these tiny companies I am not sure communication with them would be so easy. I really doubt anything drastic will come out of this. The only thing may be tightening of AML practices at the firms that take money to the exchanges.

It may be a good opportunity to learn if they are prepared for a possible influx of accounts &amp; activity.

While I want to spend BTC for their music they dropped Baghdad for the VIP Remix of Internet Friends.... I am pretty pissed about this as Baghdad was a filthy track
