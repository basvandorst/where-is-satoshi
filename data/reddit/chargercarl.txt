No. When macro economists refer to "inflation/deflation" they are specifically talking about the price level.
Only heterodox guys use other definitions.

this is such a stupid way of looking at things. If you're just going to project t(time) outwards you also need to project other variables like GDP too.
Of course if you project t out far enough everything asymptotes at 0 since the sun explodes and we all die.

yes of course. what you're missing is that  printing more coupons is a solution to price/wage stickiness.

lol, you think the layman should actually vote on specific policies?  like should the central bank target inflation or national income? how should the central bank proceed with its communication policy? does monetary policy operate through the time path of interest rates like New-Keynesians/Neo-Wicksellians say or the hot potato effect like monetarists proclaim? just LOL.
direct democracy is such a joke
and really, the fact that bitcoin has undergone 98% annual deflation really says it all. it's great if you were an early adopter and plan on cashing out, but as a means of trade...it's counter productive. why exchange bitcoins for useful goods and services if its always increasing in value? deflation isn't a stable equilibrium, otherwise you end up being able to purchase an infinite amount of future consumption with a trivial investment.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:08:01


Because it can be adjusted to meet demand, ensuring nominal stability and predictability.


M= money supply
V = velocity, the rate at which money changes hands
P = the price level
Y = real output.
I don't know the details of revolutionary france, but my guess is there was a massive supply shock (Y) with very little offset in terms of MV. In order to balance the equation P must rise.
Either way, its better to Inflate then to let a demand shock depress real output further.


money illusion breh


Mild inflation is much preferable to deflation, since it encourages spending on output, which is what you want in a currency. With deflation you just get a bunch of people hoarding the currency and not spending it, which means others who want to hold it can't get any (since theres no spending). In an economy where bitcoin was a dominant unit of account and exchange this would depress real output.
Luckily we have fiat currencies which are much more liquid.


LOL, just lol. Theres a reason why austrians are relegated to 1 or 2 academic departments worldwide and aren't accepted into any decent journals: they're shit.

"The Federal Reserve System fulfills its public mission as an independent entity within government.  It is not "owned" by anyone and is not a private, profit-making institution.
As the nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve derives its authority from the Congress of the United States. It is considered an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms.
However, the Federal Reserve is subject to oversight by the Congress, which often reviews the Federal Reserve's activities and can alter its responsibilities by statute. Therefore, the Federal Reserve can be more accurately described as "independent within the government" rather than "independent of government."

M1 is not the inflation rate you fucking idiot. look at the PCE deflator or CPI. 
If inflation had been running at 15% for the past few years then that would mean RGDP growth would have been approximately -10%/yr, which is absolutely ridiculous given every other data point available to us. (positive employment figures for example)

@_date: 2013-04-15 11:05:38

Currency is just a social construction that allows individuals to more easily  attain the production value of their output by eliminating the double coincidence of wants problem. Fiat allows us to pin down the price level and more easily maintain real output with potential.

I don't think you get it, probably because you didn't read the post, but the fact that bitcoin consists of a fixed supply makes it more volatile not less as the amount in circulation doesn't adjust to satiate demand.

1) The fed expandeth the money supply and the fed taketh away. If injections are expected to be temporary then they don't have an effect.
Imagine if the fed doubled the money supply and then promised to contract it by 1/2 exactly one year from today. Would that be inflationary? The answer is no, or not very much. Expectations matter. 
2) "We all know the fed creates asset bubbles"
Really? Cite the literature, because I call absolute bullshit on that.
3) Interest rates are not in a vacuum. If the equilibrium interest rate rises, because the economy grows at a faster rate which raises the rental rate of capital, is that bad? Obviously not.
