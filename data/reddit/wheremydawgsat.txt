Anything that implies Ross tried to murder people will be downvoted. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:04:44
What mainly surprises me is that for the last few years i've been told this wasn't a problem whatsoever. And certainly not a flaw as Bitcoin is flawless. Even hinting that it might be a problem got you downvoted to hell. 
So why is it that such a non-problem needs thread after thread on the mainpage. Have i been lied to and is it actually a problem?
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:23:18
And as always we have to guess how it's related to Bitcoin. 
But i'm sure the OP will explain to us. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 10:40:35
I'm pretty sure most companies would be happy not having to deal with you. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:03:15
This sub keeps telling me Bitcoin is not drugs related so why do you post this here?
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:07:53
Only if it's good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 23:59:01
How many more times are you gonna post this?
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:39:37
What you are experiencing is the echo chamber effect of this sub. It's in full hype mode the last few weeks. This happens every couple of months as bagholders trying to get a pump going. Your post will hype it some more. In return someone else will make another pump post how he "can feel it". As always it will die out when everyone realizes the price won't go up. 
If you really want to know how big and trendy Bitcoin is then just ask some random people on the street. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:35:52
They exist to aquire user info. That's where they make money. They don't want people to withdraw. They want people to tip so they get more suckers that give up their private info for a few penny shavings. 
Yup. Downvoting this makes it less true. Go Bitcoiners! Do what you do best. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:00:28
Oh man. We're gonna see the same post every 30 mins for the next few days. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 07:28:14
Why exactly?
Downvoted and no answer. As expected. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 07:00:41
No. Because nobody outside this sub cares about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:01:07
"A bit"
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:58:33
Do you actually believe the stuff you are typing? How does this work? Do you just pull stuff out of your ass and convince yourself it's true?
@_date: 2015-05-26 23:29:28
Right. So it isn't a problem again. Despite 200 posts threads on the mainpage 3 times a week. Gotcha. 
Bitcoiners....my god. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:02:23
No, that's not the reason and you are fully aware of that. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 19:17:25
Why do you people hate freedom and the free market?
@_date: 2015-05-26 06:50:37
You also don't know how to use the search?
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:48:12
Because the risk is insane. Use some common sense man. Get back to reality. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:57:38
What exactly did he go to jail for? What were the charges?
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:46:39
Last week some guy lost a shitload of coins because of a Trezor error. People told him he obviously shouldn't be using a Trezor. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 22:46:16
This sub's answer: Sidechains and other magical non existing technologies that in theory would create a completely different system than Bitcoin. 
Real answer: there is no solution to this problem at the moment. But good luck getting people here to admit Bitcoin has a flaw in the first place. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 07:18:10
Poe's law. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 14:03:25
Why the hell would they?
Do you realize that if you get out of this sub Bitcoin doesn't exist for the rest of the world? 
Seriously, these kind of posts are just crazy. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:08:50
I luckily never signed up there but if i did i would want to delete my account as well. Crazy how that apparently isn't possible. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 06:05:39
You have issues. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:54:44
No idea what it is but the answer is the same as in the previous 100 threads with this question: no. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 10:15:02
Calm down. He only has a million dollars in donated funds to get a secure and reliable server/site running. So, not his fault shit goes down all the time. 
Now send him some money. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:13:54
Your title is completely ridiculous. Get back to reality. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:17:28
Wth are you talking about?
@_date: 2015-05-27 22:15:10
And this is how much banks care and are "fighting" Bitcoin. 
Just to put an end to this ridiculous myth. 
Reality hurts i see from all the downvotes. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 06:43:17
The unbanked with their internet, computers and smartphones and trezors and paper wallets. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 20:51:22
All emails, usernames and passwords just got stolen. Everyone is upset. Everyone hates Theymos. And what does everyone do? They login to Bitcointalk and start posting again. Untill the next hack and everything repeats itself again. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:48:34
Which suprises nobody here as you are bat shit crazy and have severe mental issues. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 18:36:18
When i mention Bitcoin went down in x period i get downvoted to oblivion for "cherry picking" but when someone does it for another curreny you get a big amount of upvotes. As long as it makes Bitcoin look better.
This place is so full of fucking hypocrites it makes me sick. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 19:27:23
Your post is 100% correct and true and we've seen plenty of cases in the past. Yet you get downvoted to hell. 
A lot of people here have a problem with reality. 
It's really odd behavior. Bitcoiners act in a certain way but when you mention it they rage downvote you. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:11:17
Alledgely. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:16:41
Right. Thanks. 
Edit: downvoted to -6 because i thanked the guy. Well done @_date: 2015-05-28 03:17:56
Wtf? Scared of what exactly haha. Most retarded comment i've seen all day. 
Oh and when Bitcoiners start foaming from the mouth and start going through your post history you know you hit a nerve. It's hilarious to watch delusional neckbeards like you going nuts over a post. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 07:02:00
I'm gonna take a guess and say that nobody used it. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:51:07
Not really. It's a few articles that get circle jerked here for days and days. Just look back and realize what you really saw. It really isn't much. And very little has to do with making Bitcoin popular. It's mainly about shaking the dollars out of the pockets of Bitcoiners and some experimenting with the blockchain. 
People who get their news in the real world and not in this sub's fantasy land all do realize that. And that's why they are not as hyped as you are. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:33:19
No answer. As expected. 
It's the same in every off topic thread. The OP never ever explains how it's related. Funny how that works eh?
And we also both know why. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 20:31:25
Of which probably 20% are functional. And 20% of those actually get used. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 14:15:53
Neither do i. SR just added 1 more layer of middlemen. Non of the violence in the previous layers got less because of that. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 22:41:35
You go girl!
