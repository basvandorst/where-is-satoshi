Fucking this. If your whole goal is to eventually sell your crypto for fiat, you have no understanding of this investment.

Go ahead and short it if you're so certain.

I agree, until LN and widespread Segwit adoption, it will. The truth is, the massive difficulty increase actually makes bitcoin way more valuable, and this value will be realized once the fee/transaction issues are taken care of.

Because of the way Bitcoin was designed. Due to the extremely limited supply compared to most alts, and due to the huge mining community and the difficulty of each coin, they will become more valuable over time. It is the only crypto that has the variables to create enough value for all of the cryptocurrencies.
This is why you have Bitcoin and Bitcoin **Cash**. Just like we used to back dollars on the gold standard, that is the relationship Bcash will have with Bitcoin.

This. The lowest it has gone in the past few days is way higher than it was a month ago.

A hardware wallet probably strikes the best balance between safety and ease of use. I'd recommend the Ledger Nano S.

Bubbles form, people think it will go up forever. It crashes, people think it will go to 0 and never return. Emotion.

Great argument. It actually proves my point. I do not care for market manipulators, and exchanges come and go. The very fact people store their coins on an exchange prove they do not understand what they are doing.

Is this a joke? Go back to when Mt. Gox was hacked. This is nothing.

He...didn't ask what exchanges are on segwit? Jeez, calm down.
