Having done over 30 or so paypal virvox tx's, you must be either really stupid or fishing for donations or both.

The whole exchange would be nice.
I can see your problem immediately.
Generally you'd want to include the account name, registered email, date you registered, and any other account details when contacting support. Paypal does suck anus, but if you sound professional they won't think you're another scammer hijacking PayPal accounts for a non reversible exchange into bitcoin. From their perspective they wouldn't ever recover the funds if PayPal was hacked and that account spent money which instantly was converted to bitcoin and removed from their hosted accounts. Are you sure you didn't get hacked?

Do you see the NYDFS to render bitcoin regulation in step with established currency, commodity, and exchange financial scrutiny, or have they already shown that tightly penalized, un-regulated, loosely-structured jurisdiction will prevail (Worst case scenario)?

Totally agree. Between bitpay and coinbase he should be able to both list items in bitcoin and transfer out his bitcoin on a schedule to "fiat" into his bank account. Once his shop is online in bitcoin, spam me, I'll buy something :)

Virvox or paypal? Paypal probably contacted virvox and they had no record of your inquiry because they didnt acknowledge it (like you already said). The reason they didn't is beyond me, but paypal wouldnt just refund a small purchase after their records show hundreds if not thousands of transactions with the merchant and your claim looks like many claims before that were all proven scams.

Its ironic/funny that your original reddit post referenced in the bctalk thread is deleted like your virvox account. Did you speak to a virvox rep on the phone? Or paypal? That can help. Post screenshot of your inquiry email to virvox support.

Expresscoin, find a CU that does "shared branch" deposits. I had the coins pretty quickly. Their support staff is excellent also.

No, since were not living in shitty Philly we gotta pay for it when I'm sure I could teach the same thing and already do to all my cohorts and acquaintances for free. I don't even ask for a tip

Do you see side/all chains being implemented officially for greater market adoption, with the same growth factor as bitcoin? Services by nmc, btcd, darkcoin, xcp, ripple could change the nature of many more avenues of human transactions, are these seen as a threat to bitcoin in any way?

Who cares, fuck state regulation. Big Vern should have simply paid off coinfire press, would have been cheaper.

I totally agree. There are problems with larger block sizes and the current model. Truth is we havent found a consensus on a real-world usage based solution, that doesnt alienate all but the most extreme mining/ASIC corporations.
