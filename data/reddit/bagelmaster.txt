You’re still supposed to file taxes and you’d claim a loss in that case. I have a feeling A LOT of people are actually owed money for capital losses around 2017-2018. It almost seems silly for the IRS to open this can of worms.

Hind site is 20/20 and all that. If I knew a month ago it would go up $10k then I would’ve put 100% of my cash into it. But I didn’t know that. So I put about 20% in and I still made a good profit. Telling people to go all in on any kind of investment is not good advice (unless you see the future). Tomorrow bitcoin could lose thousands in an hour or two. It’s just too risky.

I took out my initial investment today. Figured $14k was the peak for now and it’ll dip back down. $2k in one day doesn’t seem sustainable to me. This is based on absolutely nothing. I still have a bunch of coins though so still “holding” but I’m only risking my “profits” at this point. Feels pretty good really
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:01
Did you turn coins back into fiat? If not then you’re good. If you did then you’ll have to look up capital gains tax rates. It depends on how much you make but it’s probably safe-ish to assume you’ll owe at least 20%

I’m not a huge fan of bitcoin, but I’ve made a lot of money from trading and holding it. It has its downsides. However, that person did not list a single one.

If you have $100k in cash to throw around (so I’m assuming it’s about 10% of what you have access to, unless you were being very careless and risky) then I wonder why you’re working in the first place.

Interesting. I’d say there’s a few things I could offer in Wikipedia’s favor here. For one, they can’t necessarily stop small campaigns of people trying to change information besides relying on user reports which they can later revert. Well, I guess they can actually, and I think they do. I don’t think it’s true anymore that “anyone” can edit Wikipedia. I think you have to have some sort of higher user privilege to do that now days (I could be wrong but I’ve read that elsewhere). 
For the second video, I think Wikipedia may have been in the right taking down the reporter’s entry. They cited, according to her, not having enough or reliable third party sources to validate her wiki entry. She cited some resources, one of which I remember was Joe Rogan’s site? Is that reliable? I dunno. Does this lady really need a wiki entry? Again, I dunno. Sounds like a bit of a non issue. I will admit I only watched half the second video, however. Was there a further point beyond “Wikipedia takes down information when they feel like and offers half baked excuses?” Because that’s where I felt the video was going after about a minute. 
I’d argue all of these issues could be addressed by trying to educate people more on reading further into Wikipedia entries. Don’t just read the article on something important and take it as factual. Maybe click on the resources offered and consider their credibility. That’s asking a lot though. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:45:26
Probably best to sell smaller amounts. Maybe transfer like $10k worth at a time to an exchange you can trust, transfer to bank, wait for confirmation, repeat. Or attempt to find someone reputable and sell it to them.

Yeah I wouldn’t buy right now maybe in a couple days. When btc dips alts seem to rise, so that’s probably a smart choice on your part.

You generally can’t. If you bought with a credit card you could call them and try to stop payment, but good luck. Same for a bank transfer. You’d probably have to lie to either entity about it being a fraudulent payment to have any chance at cancelling it. Alternatively, you just accept your mistake and hold the btc and hope it goes back up.

It’s just a crypto meme at this point that means hold your currency during the dips and crashes because when things swing back up you’ll probably make money. Take the advice with a grain of salt. If you’re in danger of losing too much (which you shouldn’t be if you followed rule 1 of investing: never put in more than you’re willing to lose) then you might have to make a hard choice sometimes.

There was a case recently where Coinbase was compelled to turn over customer info to the irs. You could try not paying taxes if your profits are really low (like less than $10k I’d say) but if you get caught get ready to beg and plead ignorance. If you’re lucky they’ll just take the money you owed plus fine the shit out of you. If you’re unlucky or the amount you took was substantial you might go to prison. It’s a different form of gambling!

As long as it’s still over $10k then whatevs really 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:28:34
I mean it should be considered a joke as a resource by itself. That’s why any reputable work place or academic environment won’t let you use Wikipedia as a source of information. It’s good for background reading like if I wanted to know where Bernie sanders grew up or I wanna know generally how cells divide. But obviously if you want reputable information you should be seeking other or at least additional resources. 
Also I don’t think it’s necessarily bad they won’t let individuals edit their own pages. Would we want celebrities or politicians being able to change facts they don’t like about themselves? I wouldn’t. Maybe they should have a priority report system for the individual though. Like if Trump saw some obviously false stuff about himself he could report it, offer evidence why it’s wrong, and hopefully it would get fixed faster. I dunno. Wikipedia isn’t perfect by any means, but it’s still a pretty cool thing to exist.

Coinbase goes down literally every time btc dumps a significant amount and it usually causes a feedback loop and causes btc is dump even harder. In the past the price usually recovers fairly quickly after the big dump and the “oh god the world is crashing” people have sold.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:14:43
He’s ignoring you because you’re flat out wrong. All you have to do is look at the numbers this past week... it was set to hit 13k and then start moving downward and that’s exactly what happened. Coinbase went down because people who knew this was coming were trying to gtfo and take profits at the top. It’s poised to keep going down btw then go back up to the clouds (assuming support holds). Could be a couple weeks, but it’ll be fine if you don’t like messing around trying to trade and stuff.

Burn your card? Not with proper cooling. That’s not how electronics work. Keep the card cool (below 70C) and it’ll be fine. That’s like saying “don’t play pubg on your gaming pc because it’ll make it hot and kill your card!” No. Keep it at a reasonable temp and it’s not going to have a noticeable effect on the life of the card. Not to mention most companies have warranties and yes mining is considered reasonable usage (not that they’d know anyway).

@_date: 2017-11-20 14:58:58
You can’t beat yourself up with that logic. I’m sure most of us heard of bitcoin back in like 2011 when it was dirt cheap. Sure I could’ve bought a thousand coins then and be a millionaire. But no one knew (and no one did unless they can time travel) it would actually take off like it did or else we’d all be millionaires now. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:44:47
This is why you gotta tell people “don’t spend more than you can afford to lose.” Even if bitcoin went down to zero and never went back up I’d be ok because I didn’t spend more than I could afford. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:07:16

@_date: 2017-11-30 19:28:03
If you want out then I guess get out and accept your loss. But I’d personally suggest holding on until you at least break even... it’s very likely to go back to 11k+ in the near future. It might take a week or two or a month no one knows but I think it’ll probably get there. Or you could get out now and take a minimum loss if the whole thing falls out. It’s all a guessing game.

If he’s American (I honestly don’t know and too lazy to look up) he probably hasn’t read our Declaration of Independence. According to ole Tom J., governments are created to to secure our rights. Not make money. That’s just stupid anyway. I guess it makes sense for them to print money up until the creation of the internet, but why should they hold that spot indefinitely? A currency not tied to any government seems to make some sense. But governments would lose control over money, so of course they’re scared of that scenario.

It’s not exactly easy to explain. The simplest answer is “because it must.” An alternative answer is because sell pressure will remain high until that region when a shit ton of buy orders will be triggered which will push the price up quickly and cause algos and humans to purchase it causing a large spike. I dunno, you do you. Just remember this comment when it hits about $3800.

I’m really confused on capital gains taxes. If i buy a bitcoin at $4k and sell it a year later at (let’s hope) $20k, how does the IRS even know I made that money? If it were millions in profits I’m sure they’d notice, but a few thousand? What happens if you don’t pay it and hope they never notice? What’s the statue of limitations on not paying a tax like that? I’m not endorsing anyone doing such a thing, but personally I feel like the government has no right to money made by trading digital currency (personal opinion).

30 years seems low. If bitcoin really hits ridiculous highs like some people predict, then there will be a ton of young people in their 30s-40s worth millions of dollars. That would have to an absolute minimum of 30 years if they retire (and who wouldn’t) as early as possible. I personally plan/hope to live to at least 80 and maybe even far longer with advancing medicine. Hopefully investing some in bitcoin now allows me to afford the best (yes, lul American healthcare system not being free and all that).

No, but it’s full name is bitcoin cash so calling it bcash isn’t too bad in my view unless the intent is to coverup that it is a fork of bitcoin (by basically deleting out the name bitcoin). If that’s the intent then it’s kinda childish. I don’t really have a dog in the fight because I don’t own an appreciable amount of either btc or bch but I don’t see why they can’t get along. I don’t know who started the shit flinging first but it would probably be better for crypto overall if it stopped. People love drama and having a team though.

I doubt the second part. If you had invested in some good coins late last year then you’d have a lot more btc now since they increased at much higher rates.

I 8x my initial btc holdings by playing around with “shit coins” last year and it feels pretty good.
