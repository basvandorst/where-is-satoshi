Was just going to say - if you're properly capitalized then how is this a "risk"?

As soon as grain producers and oil companies start taking a fiat currency w/ high volatility, no sovereign backing, w/ no natural buyers/sellers, that nobody currently uses for commerce instead of taking literally anything else, I'll come back and tell you I was wrong. Until then enjoy your worthless paper..

Collectibles are objects of speculation too... which doesn't mean they aren't prone to bubbles... read "Manias Panics and Crashes" by Kindleberger..
There is no right reason to overpay for something w/ no value IMO, if you can realize a gain just do it before you can't, because right now the only thing inflating the price is positive feedback, not value.

Haha my man, trading isn't the same as buying something and hoping it goes up - keep crossing spreads and you'll keep buying my lunch :)

None of y'all are "investing" in a currency or a technology, you're buying worthless paper that isn't regulated and has no intrinsic value - if you can realize a gain, do it, don't wait until what is so clearly a bubble to burst...  
You can buy oil with dollars, you can buy minerals with AUD, what commerce is done in BTC? I do business w/ currencies, I buy assets for their coupon/income, what do you buy bitcoin for except hoping it keeps going up? A currency is exactly as valuable as the commodities it buys - which in BTC is nothing.
As someone that trades financial instruments for a living, this reads like a desperate yahoo message boards post re: a penny stock...
