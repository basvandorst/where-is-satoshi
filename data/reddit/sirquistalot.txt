This is your fault.

You might be a psychopath if...
Lemme guess, you frequent 4chan a lot?

Take a look at Metalicoin, y’all.

All good here. Do your research before spreading FUD.

Skycoin is 6 years old, and it’s more ambitious than MAID.
It has its own blockchain. It’s own programming language. It’s own object system...
It’s implementing a new consensus algorithm, called Obelisk, that replaces both PoW and PoS.
They have hardware and have more in the works, including omni-directional and parabolic antennas for people to mount on the roofs of their homes to create a giant mesh network.
...all designed by two of the original Bitcoin and Ethereum developers.
Competition is a good thing.

Trump voters are dumb enough to believe this.
@_date: 2018-07-29 01:15:37
Uh huh. Got any proof just more unsubstantiated claims?

I was looking for more sociology-based explanations, I guess.
The unemployment rate was dropping nearly the entire time Obama was in office. Clinton too.

If they “had” a job, they aren’t currently working.

The majority are mindless drones that are doing as told and are unable to think critically for themselves.
Then there are the Bible thumpers that literally believe he was ushered in by God. Fucking delusional.
@_date: 2018-07-27 23:03:04
Besides, why are you bringing up employment status?
@_date: 2018-07-29 02:14:13
Do you think there might be a reason why they are unemployed besides just being lazy? What made them turn to a life of crime?
I agree welfare could be reformed. Like, I hate seeing people being able to buy Mt. Dew and Cheetos with welfare benefits, but why are you so against helping someone out?

“You haven’t lost money until you’ve sold.” is what he’s getting at.

Case and point.
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:31:23
The scams work?
@_date: 2018-07-28 05:51:12
I never said that. You ought to work on your reading comprehension.
And, lol, so the majority of the people that voted don’t work?
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:29:40
Who implied that Trump voters don’t work? Nobody, so you weren’t on topic.
All that was implied is that people that didn’t vote Trump don’t work.
