I can appreciate that he was likely pushed to that position, but even with context, using your wealth to say you are better than someone, and the whole "I was a self made millionaire" are really off putting, and paint him in a bad light.

I don't know about anything coordinated, but the Swedish guy, forget his name, was definitely out in force over all sorts of newsoutlets telling everyone to sell their BTC and buy BCH instead.
I learnt of this because all of a sudden my dad was saying "the founder of bitcoin is saying you shouldn't buy anymore". And no surprises, I went and read the article, and it read exactly like that "bitcoin.com co-founder has sold all his bitcoin and bought bitcoin cash instead", which reads to any laymen exactly how my dad interpreted it. Bitcoin.com of course being the bitcoin cash website.
This was also an Australian Newspaper.

This is not whataboutism, which has become far too much of a buzzword, and is more properly termed the fallacy of relative privation. The fallacy of relative privation requires that the two problems compared be largely independent from each other, and not affect each other in anyway.
However, in the comparison you replied to, the problems are very much dependent on each other; one intends to replace the other. So whataboutism is not very relevant.

I appreciate government, I however do not appreciate a government that is at the whim of big banks and wallstreet. Hence bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:23:48
Like I said elsewhere, I think government is very useful, but I don't appreciate a government that is largely influenced by big money. And I think the current banking and finance system are a big problem there. But this is not at all my primary motivated for supporting bitcoin.
More fundamentally, I think our global economy is too disconnected from reality. I think a blockchain system that is fundamentally tied to an energy input, and isn't allowed to grow infinitely, is capable of giving us a global economy that is much more tied to reality. This doesn't mean I want to go back to the gold standard, it means I want a new solution, because I think the global economy being disconnected from reality is a very big problem.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:27:15
Having a currency directly tied to an energy input has the possibility for major benefits. It means it's far more directly tied to reality than our current global economy, that I think is far too disconnected from reality. And I think it intrinsically brings in a lot of negative externalities in our current economics. Negative externalities of the global economy being what I see as the major problem of our generations.
Generally, this is refereed to as a thermodynamic theory for money.

That last source is extremely dodgy, because they go on to criticise all previous election even under Chavez, in contradiction to every major electoral watch dog. So ignoring that last source as it should be rightly ignored, I'll just address your first source.
It doesn't read like a claim of rigged elections, it just reads like the carter center throwing out a clarification statement due to negative publicity they have likely received. Let's break it down:


Okay, so what's changed. I Assume they'll explain that in the very next sentence.


All this is saying is that Maduro used the Carter Center comment as positive publicity. Well, why wouldn't he? It doesn't contradict the first statement.


That is a substanceless statement that is just PR maneuvering to retroactively cover their ass given that the Maduro government is now in the target of the US government.


But many other election watch dogs have.
So, given all that, I think my statement still holds true.
@_date: 2019-03-12 12:53:06


More importantly, he's the guy who out of nowhere, with no process, just declared himself interim president of Venezuela. Of course he's going to do everything he can to disrupt Maduro's government.
Don't forget, or perhaps you weren't aware, that every legitimate election watchdog committee on earth, Including the Carter Center, declared Venezuela's elections one of the most sophisticated and democratic election systems out there. So, be careful when you are backing the word of an individual like Guerdo, who would so cavalierly ignore all that in a crisis in order to further his own gains.
Thankfully, his power move is now dead in the water.

Essentially, the situation in Venezuela can outlined like this: Before the election of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela was one of the most inequal countries; there were large slums of people sitting right next to huge mansions of others, and there was really no middle ground between these two classes.
Hugo Chavez was elected as president by devoting his platform to the representation of that slum living under class of people, and that is how he was able to win the election by a strong majority. What follows is characterised by a desperate struggle between opposing corporate interests and government interests.
Start with these two articles if you want to understand the situation:

but nothing it practices is communist in any meaningful way? Could you give some example of what you think is communist practice that china partakes in? Communism is fundamentally defined by three primary things, stateless, moneyless and high social equality (read no social classes). China doesn't have any of those things; and isn't working towards any. 
China has a highly state controlled economy, which in and of itself isn't at all communist. But honestly, the difference between the relationships of Chinese billionaires and their government and US billionaires and theirs is highly academic these days anyway. And It's built its economy off the backs of a migrant slave force (migrants from china itself), just like any modern day capitalist country has in the past.

Fundamentally it requires social cohesion, something that homogeneity can serve to create. But you can have social cohesion without total homogeneity, primarily by making societies problems common to everyone; i.e. by having high social equality.

I'd say there are more groups that benefit from keeping people polarised. No, confused doesn't mean irrational, you're thinking panicked. Confused means you don't understand the situation, and given the fact that the situation is often very complex, it's a good starting point to learn more. Whereas, coming into a new situation, and not being confused, i.e. taking the first simple, but wrong, explanation for it, means you become polarised, and become very much handicapped in terms of properly understanding the situation.

That would have to be unrelated phenomena. All this phenomena seems reasonably related, and the point of this exercise is to determine if they are actually related. So cool it.

Not just that, I think the more important thing comes down to inductance versus capacitance. High frequency is very good at passing through capacitance based impedance, and very bad at passing through inductance based impedance. Impedance = frequency * inductance, Impedance = 1/(frequency * capacitance). So if the human body's impedance is primarily made up of capacitance, then a high frequency signal is going to see very little impedance (AC), where as a signal with no frequency (DC) is going to see an infinite impedance.

It's definitely a trend, but not an explicit one (i.e. a function defined by an x variable), and it sounds like you're fitting it by [interpolation]( rather than directly fitting it.

If you were a mathematician, you'd probably go about trying to fit a trend to it, rather than find an average. An average is a linear fit, but looking at the bitcoin price so far looks very much like a power law, so any average fit is going to vastly underestimate the current trend into the future.
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:38:16
problem is, I don't think the guy has a data set, he's just interpolating from the value when he first bought and today's value.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:15:57
True, seeing as the average is as a percentage, rather than an absolute value, it's definitely not linear. Still, the best way to do it would be to fit a power law.

You'd still be buying bitcoin at USD price though right? The only benefit to it would be if you buy the bitcoins and then the exchange rate keeps going up.

Actually, reserve amounts haven't been specified for years now, at least in the [UK, Canada and Australia]( I imagine it is similar in the US. Because of this, private banks have more 'control' over the amount of money circulating, it was found that during the GFC there was 80x the base money of currency circulating in the UK. Also, a significant amount of people do not realise that banks use their money in such ways, largely because even government officials of these countries will still say that their federal reserves have full control over the money circulating.
So my point is, that this use of money without any real guarantee that you will be able to access it in the future, is how a lot of banks currently operate, even with a lot of people not having knowledge of this, due to being misinformed by the officials in place.
Kinda similar sounding, isn't it.
@_date: 2015-09-15 04:02:53
This is what banks do all the time though. Take your money and use it, with the promise that they will be able to give it back at some time in the future.

I don't ever recall a seed when I made my android wallet, but I do have a computer back up. What's the difference? And how would a seed maintain all the necessary information unless it knows all the possible addresses the wallet will ever generate?

Same with [Green Man Gaming](
@_date: 2017-07-28 06:30:47
Cheers. So if I keep an up to date back up, then it should be effectively the same as having a seed. I really don't remember a seed with the standard android bitcoin wallet.

@_date: 2017-07-28 06:39:17
I imagine the issue with a seed though, is that once someone else has it, they have access to your coins? But with a backup, they still need the encryption key to gain access.

Okay. I'm not sure this wallet I'm using lets you make one. Thanks for the information.

What you mention there is one of the big motivators for bitcoin popularity in the first place. When the 2008 GFC happened, people couldn't access their money, because it didn't exist in any simultaneous fashion. Banks had gone above and beyond in terms of fractional reserve banking, and created a market where 80% of the "cash flow" was just debts and gambling. So that when people went to get their money out in the craziness, they found out it wasn't their's, and they couldn't get it.
Bitcoin doesn't have this problem, the coins are always there, and there isn't any market inflation beyond the existing cash flow. In this sense, it's more real than fiat.
