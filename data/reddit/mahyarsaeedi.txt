The BTC transaction is visible on the blockchain and has been confirmed that it was received to the Mycelium wallet with 809 confirmations. I think there is an issue on the app where the amount of btc I have is not registering. When I scanned the ticket at the bitcoin atm the other day it also showed the incorrect amount and the ATM guys fortunately override their system and sorted out the situation. They then sent me back the 0.032 btc as a refund from the error. Now the mycelium wallet is doing the same thing when I'm sending to my other wallet.

Exactly. I mean its one thing to take suggestions and troubleshooting yourself but its another to let some random stranger take control of your computer. lol

lol to some extent you are correct. There is always something new to learn and no one has all the answers.

It’s not letting me without a phone number and I’m not trying to register for Skype just for this.
Their is a few methods like I said that I did and worked heads driectly from support.
I don’t want to tell you something and you do it wrong and corrupt the wallet. The wallet may already be corrupted and funds useless.
If we teamview we can legit see exactly what’s going on and have a live chat. It’s just easier

Yeah, I don't feel comfortable with that. I don't see why you'd need remote access to my computer when the wallet is on my phone. It's all good though I will just wait to hear back from the mycelium support team and dig into it a little. I rather not have someone I don't know gain access to my device. If it was easy enough to explain then I would probably be able to sort it out but if it's going to take some remote access etc to figure it out then it's not worth our time. Thanks for the support though. Hopefully it gets sorted out.
