Having bitcoin is like having and impenetrable forcefield that can shoot lasers of value across the world to other cool people with forcefields.
People, criminals, banks, and even governments can't get through the field or tell you where you can shoot your money laser. It it is truly empowering. 
Sure, if you let your friends use your forcefield they can steal it but it's pretty easy to not do that. Someday everyone will have their own.
I can't think of an analogy for CCs but they just kind of suck.

This walks you through creating a multisig transaction in qt: 
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:19:01
The multisig address is made from combining the public keys so the private keys can be generated anywhere. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 04:40:23
couldn't someone manipulate this by creating a bunch of accounts?
@_date: 2014-09-22 04:48:26
The writer probably gathered his information from other news articles about bitcoin which are often inaccurate and vague. There's still a lot of educating that needs to be done.
@_date: 2014-09-19 05:36:52
Great job Steve!
@_date: 2014-11-12 07:36:14
I agree. This is a hypothetical question that will vary person to person but it's good to see what people think so we can get on the same page.

I'm not complaining. I'm glad to see bitcoin in the WSJ and I do feel a shared responsibility for educating people about bitcoin if that's what you're worried about.

I think this is an important point. I worry about Bitcoin's delusion of grandeur being its own demise. With that said, lets remember to keep Bitcoin disruptive. The balance here is between Bitcoin's prevalence and realizing it's disruptive potential.

Right off the bat this description would make me think that bitcoins are ridiculous 


Creators aren't allowed to keep all the bitcoins they create?


No, that's a bitcoin address.


The increase in demand for the relatively scarce amount of **bitcoins** will drive up bitcoin's value.

It's just Bitcoin, not anarchycoin or libertariancoin. and it's interesting. Otherwise, why are you spending so much time here?

Your attempt at being condescending is kind of cute.

photos and songs can be copied. Bitcoins are inputs and outputs.
@_date: 2014-09-29 03:59:27
People generally buy bitcoins when they hear about bitcoin and become excited about the tech.

I'm having trouble believing this story. Use local bitcoins or mycellium and that should solve your made up problem.

People use Ubuntu for a ton of different reasons but they still have a mission statement because it helps their community. I hear what you're saying though.
Really, I just think it we should try to define what we mean when we say "to the moon!" apart from a rise in price. I love the rallying cry.

Yeah, but it's used by almost all economist to refer to an increase in the general price level.  If it's the increase in money supply they will call it monetary inflation.

I think he makes some good points about the community and space. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies need to have some criticism. It kind of freaks me out how angry people get for others criticizing it or not liking it and I'm tired of hearing the internet analogies. Let's just accept that no one really knows what will happen with cryptocurrencies. There's no reason to lash out at people who want to leave and try to discredit them because you're too much of a coward to consider both sides. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 18:06:08
