Given the speed with which Apple's pay system and Google's pay system were integrated into debit machines I expect we could have bitcoin just as quickly...if there was political will.

The cost was...brain cells?

This was pretty confusing to me because I didn't know the original cryptocurrency **software** created by Satoshi was technically renamed to "Bitcoin Core" (**for using** BTC).    
I guess that's what he was trying to take advantage of.  
Also, it was pretty disingenuous of him to refer to "Bitcoin Cash" (BCH) as simply "Bitcoin."  
edit:  My initial comment was wrong.  I edited it for accuracy. The added words are in bold.
edit 2:  Here's the wikipedia entry for [Bitcoin Core.](

Ooops.  Sorry about my misunderstanding.  I edited my comment to reflect what you're saying and cross checked it with the wikipedia entry for [Bitcoin Core.](  It's correct now right?

What's the official Bitcoin twitter page (if there even is such a thing)?

That's my question too.  However, computers aside, I think he has a point.

I immediately thought about steemit after reading your comment. 
It's a social media platform (so usernames reoccur on other sites) and the wallet value is public.  Steemit generates the passwords though so they're unlikely to be reused.  
How do you think this applies to steemit?

This could have been a beautiful shittymorph.

If you view them both purely as speculative assets I can understand the comparison. But you need to value each in order to compare them.  
$20 in Apple stock vs $20 in Bitcoin is something you could measurably compare the performance of over time.

But Monero is anonymous, right?
