I use GDAX, so I'll stick to that. Thanks, man! 
I feel lame. I should have done this months ago with a friend, but I've been a broke college student. Anyways, I put a little money in mid-bubble, so lets hope it pays off. Take it easy!

I put my gains on it. Few hundred here and there. I pay a few bucks to turn it into fiat, but there’s no wait. I can use my card right after. It’s good when used sparingly. It’s nice to have a backup of funds on hand.
Gets around that 3-day wait if you need it a bit faster.

Yep. You can’t just buy it on a whim your first time. Verification takes awhile.

On my ledger since forever. If you aren’t holding your own keys, you’re doing crypto wrong.
