The number of coins doesn't matter. It's always up to collective psychology. That's why some coins are held more tightly than others.  For instance, Rchain didn't receive much pullback in 2017 when others did because the participants had confidence in it. Then they spent half a year on a music app and now it's in the ground.

Awesome! I bought ~0.1 BTC at their Yurakucho store recently. It was smooth, pulled out a smartphone, opened Safari, it was signed into bitflyer.com, scanned the QR and waited ~5 seconds for the green checkmark (0 confirmations). They could only use it at 1 register of the 4 registers though. $1000 maximum purchase. They gave us a piece of paper explaining refunds (they give back fiat). I asked how many transactions they get per day and he said ~15. It was only 1 floor and not the most popular, so I figure 60-100 per day. Not bad, the move to accept in all will certainly help!

Hey Luke. Since most miners will reject a double spend transaction by comparing what's in mempool, and the retailer can submit the transaction, and check for any inconsistencies (destination address/fee), why isn't that sufficient? 
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:10:32

There appears to be a little bit of confusion that I could have made clearer in a diagram or blog post. First of all, yes double spending is possible, if the receiving end does nothing, as normal. What Satoshi suggested here is the receiving end (payment processor) should do something extra. They should monitor the network for reasonable transactions BEFORE verifying the purchase (letting the customer leave store with products). It should simply check if other nodes have received a transaction with the correct destination address and a reasonable fee. If the right transaction exists on the majority of the network (or even less most likely, because a double spend overtaking the few nodes one would have to check is highly unlikely), the retailer can be confident that transaction will be fulfilled even if it has 0 block confirmations, AND any double spend transaction would be refused by the majority of the nodes because it already exists in their memory. For additional quicker validation, the payment processor could submit the transaction to the highest hashing nodes. If those nodes have the right transaction, no way is a double spend transaction winning out (this is kind of like Lightning with its trusted participants). Does that make sense?
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:24:47
Oh okay, so basically you mean the hype will cause people to hold thus cause higher valuation.

Also note you are using features of blockchain which they warn you about. Going to the area to restore backups requires inputting your password again and agreeing to a warning that says you are using advanced features you ought not to use unless you know what you're doing.

Right, we will feel the impact of the lost coins in the valuation one day when people aren't reluctant to accept Bitcoin as their primary currency. Until then, which won't happen without much more adoption by businesses, the lost coins won't have much of an impact on the valuation, because what's the value of lost coins in a currency you aren't even TOTALLY 100% sure of? Nothing. You have to believe in it 100% before you'll see those lost coins as having increased value in your holdings. My 2 cents.

Thing is, they in all likelihood WONT maintain 0.02 BTC per week for a year. That thus far as been their peaking area (besides the 0.36). 28.6 * 0.05 = 1.43 BTC per week. So, $185 a week to maintain his PT, get more people into AM, let you utilize smaller sums, and even double dip on dividends. Honestly though, don't you think as a stock manager he has fees too? I know there's a ~5 BTC registration fee, which it seems like he hasn't even made back yet. What about monthly fees or processing fees? I believe he's said he pays additional fees, but I'm not sure how much they are. Point is, at the end of the month he's making *at most on a good month* $740. You say it'll take 120 years to go from 550 to 5000? If anyone puts 120 years into anything, they probably deserve more than that, because they be one crazy immortal bastard.

Think about it this way. The hashrate fluctuates. It could drop 60% in an hour, but be back the next minute or hour. Do you freak out in that hour saying it's bad news and revenue dropped and blah blah blah? I think you wait and see. How long you wait is up to you, but being that this company is generally good news, I think it's premature to call it bad news after only a few days. In the grand scheme of the company, this is a fluctuation, a blip that means nothing. If it continues for a few weeks then yah, but it didn't, it skyrocketed after the dividend. I know BTC moves fast, but still, we'll likely look at 2013 and be amazed at 0.018+. It increased dramatically and the price is justified even at that price, we could even call the 0.035's one-offs and it's a perfectly sound investment. Thus you don't call the 0.018's a drop in revenue, you call the 0.035's a bonus. It's all relative to your own greed, faith and patience.

OP, you don't need to provide photo ID or utility or ANY verification to use the LibertyBit exchange. And it only cost $2 to do an e-Interac email transfer both for deposit and withdrawal. $4 to do a bank transfer. Additionally, you can use btcQuick with a visa (debit card too now?) and only need your photo ID. Edit: Wait what the fuck happened, LibertyBit must have removed these options VERY recently within the last week. That sucks. btcQuick should still be alright though. I guess you need to get a bill in your name (you don't have to pay it, just something that comes to you at your address). Actually this is common, outside of Bitcoin, and usually it doesn't have to be a bill exactly, any form of official document. So, you should try something like mail from the government, like your GST cheque or mail for your ID card or taxes or medical bill or anything like that should work. Using exchanges and 4 day bank transfers is pretty easy, common, and not too expensive ($4-$10 or 2-4%).

I'm also fully invested already, so I have nothing to gain by trying to keep it down (reinvestment), whereas people saying it's a bubble do (especially daytraders - you basically cannot daytrade AM at this time). Every opinion is biased in some way. Research for yourself and determine for yourself which ASIC company to back, if at all. Decide for yourself if it's overvalued based on risk, return, realistic predictions and reliability.

If BFL had delivered before the April crash, the entry fee to get into bitcoin mining would be substantially harder. So hard that most of the new influx of bitcoin fans wouldn't see a potential for profit in mining, and wouldn't invest in new ventures. Right now, people are still waiting for BFL, but they're also investing in Avalon, Bitfury, and mining bonds trying to get a  profit or get lucky. Unfortunate for BFL purchasers, but good for bitcoin value. There's so much bitcoin (new and reinvestment) tied up in mining ventures that it really helps the value.

I'm not "fixating" on anything. I have many calculations and offered one of them. That was the last major peak and sell off crash. "It's dividends are poor compared to owning a competitors ASIC miner yourself." Oh please, tell me where to get these competitor ASICs because last I checked none have fulfilled all backorders (or even any). Last I checked you don't know the future and won't know if any of those pre-ordered ASICs will break even because you don't know the future difficulty. The yearly return on AM is still very much not inflated, and that's just math, if you can risk being in Bitcoin at all. I'm not saying there won't be competition, but take a look at the current "competitors," BFL, Avalon, Bitfury, KnC. They aren't competitors yet. You're the one operating on theory. The theory being that they will become competitors around September. Which would be cool, but I'm not putting my hopes on that as they have proven nothing. In addition, AM is so far ahead that it could afford to remain competitive with future competitor prices, but has NO REASON to do that now with these clowns, and there goes your weak hardware argument. Edit: Thank you for responding though, as I was very interested to see if you offered up anything new. Sorry for being a hostile in my rebuttal.

BFL and others can certainly bring heavy competition for AM and severely crash the price. It will not happen this month though. So my suggestion is dump into AM for this month, and pull out then if you want. It's just as likely that they don't bring much competition, just more delays, pre-orders, and slow shipping, which can and likely will continue to give AM the edge, and will not see any crash. Both are possible, but for at least a month, AM is not at risk IMO.

I don't know about that. 10 BTC is $1200. That's actually 120000 yen. I'm in Japan and we use numbers that high all the time, and people would be more comfortable with that than any decimals, and the consistency of mostly only using mBTC for more purchases.

Ya but you can resell it to someone later who wants it either for a longer ROI or novelty. If you do that in bulk...
@_date: 2013-06-04 00:23:36
Very very very little risk. You can't double spend on one transaction very easily. It's not even really worth it to do so. The significant effort to overwhelm the network hashrate to double spend would earn more hashing as a good guy. I'm sure they're monitoring the network anyway and would notice a major change like a shift to 51% and can put a hold on transactions.

Pointless article. Uses negative data from MtGox. MtGox... everybody is scrambling out of that mess because of MtGox, not Bitcoin. Even if Bitcoin were the problem, which it's not, the correction was already forecasted at $33 and $18 as a normal bubble. Bitcoin is not a normal bubble, it's a recurring correction. We corrected at $50 already. Instead of dispair all the way to $33 and a slow correction, we corrected quickly because we know the value of Bitcoin. There's so much more capital, ventures and plans around this now. Way too much to undervalue it like that. We've gained more adoption, more utility and uses for Bitcoin since then. That's why it's not correcting to normal stock market bubbles where they pop and nothing really changes for a while. Really late entry to the price correction speculation party. Pointless article.

I'm not saying it's a hedge. I'm just saying if you want to protect yourself from BTC "corrections," (or crashing if you will) instead of converting to FIAT, put it in AM instead and for now you'll end up ahead and not contribute to the decline in BTC price.

They do more than USB miners, which continue to sell, and why would you bet against the industry leader and friedcat in succeeding in leading to then nextgen? BFL is a joke. They're shipping but sluggishly. Avalon is good but behind. Bitfury is way behind and prob can't handle volume. BTW they are at 20.3%. They could go to 50%, but they will probably only go to 30%. That's still a 50% increase.
@_date: 2013-06-21 02:42:03
I'm not blaming you. I'm saying you could be one of these people selling off to pick it back up. That's very common and doesn't have much to do with AM's profitability. The other part are perhaps people who just got in and panic. If you look at the history, there's no other reasons to pull out because one week is half revenue, because it's still many times higher than it used to be, and the price ratio is still very profitable. 14% ups and downs aren't uncommon anyway. Maybe not in one hour, but this is the digital Bitcoin world. It happens with all the Bitcoin stocks, and has nothing to do with AM. Welcome to Bitcoin stocks.
@_date: 2013-06-02 19:04:16
Why? More bitcoin tied up with them makes bitcoin more scarce. If anything, they've contributed to the value (think about THAT).

Stable revenue? lmao.. this isn't a freaking hand out. He could make it stable by giving you only 10% at a maximum of 10% APR. That would be stable. Instead we see the ups and downs at 40%+ APR. Big deal. Stop drinking the haterade.

@_date: 2013-06-09 08:58:11
Yes. I don't think it had anything to do with a correction from the April bubble. I feel it was the delayed affect of the 5 million dollar sell-off a couple weeks ago (drop from $130 to $120). Some people didn't see the recovery they'd like and it's just been a snowball of dumping. People now know to just dump when it's tanking, and buy it back up at the bottom. This is the first dump not inspired by a news event, that I know of, or it was orchestrated by someone with a lot of capital. The fear that there may be a correction is kind of self-manifesting though.

Kind of irrelevant because the reseller's profit would just be what his 2 BTC would have been valued, had he not spent it on one of these. By selling, he's just collecting the USD profit he missed after spending the 2 BTC. However, when he resells he can probably resell at a price in BTC (or converted at the price of USD at the time) that the USB will have an ROI of 1 year. Thus, he can mine for 1 year, maybe only getting 75% return, then sell to someone who wants to mine for the next 1 year at a price 50% of his initial cost, giving him a 125% return. Theoretically, only profitable enough if you buy them in bulk and go through the hassle of reselling them.
The large lot size saves on shipping costs, data entry and other complications.

Centralization is not hurting the network at this time. Hypothetically it could be a problem, but it's not at the moment. Hashing power on the other hand does help to secure the network against people you don't trust. In the case of a pool, you trust the pool, but no one else, so you secure it against everyone except that pool in the case the pool takes a staking control of the network. It's better to trust no one and solo mine, but that's not consistently profitable (if at all due to luck).
@_date: 2013-05-27 17:46:01
0.2 BTC? IMHO, it'll still be profitable enough to make that back sufficiently (less than a year) assuming they ship them out at all (which they've started so why stop now).
