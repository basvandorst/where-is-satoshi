Agree with this from Coinsetter CEO. There's a lack of clarity.
“As a New York City-based exchange, we have awaited regulatory clarity from New York that enables us to offer better deposit and withdrawal methods to customers. Most execs in the industry still feel that the final BitLicense rules are fairly ambiguous, but I hope the DFS will work with the industry to help it grow.
My use of the word “hope” highlights an issue we see with financial regulation today. There is an extreme lack of clarity from our perspective as an innovating company in terms of what will be required of us to obtain a license in any state. Coinsetter will submit an application to the NYDFS that we believe merits licensure. We will also continue pushing to offer innovative products that help enhance personal freedom and create low cost ways for the underbanked to transfer money.
Our company has verbalized an understanding of working alongside regulation for many years now. Now that the BitLicense is approaching, I hope that the NYDFS and other state regulators will help support fast innovation in financial technology startups through extreme flexibility and low cost burden.”

I will tell you one thing, though: I am not going to be following a Russian ex-KGB agent’s leadership. America has a proud history of combining moral order with liberty. Our Founding Fathers were neither statists nor libertines.
