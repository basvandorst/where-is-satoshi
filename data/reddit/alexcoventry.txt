It could easily handle a further increase by 30 orders of magnitude before it would start to have problems, under its current security assumptions.
2^256 / (60 * 10) ~= 2e74 Hashes/s is the hard limit where you would expect to get a pre-image of 0 roughly every 10 minutes. It's currently at about 7e19  Hashes/s. Above that, the average block-arrival time would start to drop below 10 minutes.

There's no way they're doing that without some kind of assurance from Binance.

Bizarre... That's probably the wrong value, but I would expect it to pass that guard.

What's the full backtrace? It looks like the fingerprint calculation has changed.

You'd probably need to provide the code with the failing example. I am probably not your guy, though, since I despise PHP.
@_date: 2012-02-19 20:02:34
That's not too surprising, because I'm not trained as a computer scientist (my degree's in applied math.)  But I welcome any specific suggestions you have about ways to make it more acceptable.

Anyway, I apologize for my slightly snide tone in my conversation with you, Todamont.  It came from a reaction to factors which have nothing to do with you personally, and the improvements you suggested would be valuable.

If NooShares are used to purchase a computation, they cease to exist.   I feel as though I may have misunderstood your question, though, so let me know I'm not being clear.
@_date: 2012-02-19 21:15:37
Not sure which problem you're referring to, or how transaction fees relate to it.  Could you elaborate, please?
@_date: 2012-02-21 00:15:17
No, bitcoin transactions *per se* demand relatively modest resources.  You might want to read through section 2.1, or some other primer which explains the role of the blockchain lottery like the original bitcoin paper.

Thanks.  If I decide it's not worth implementing, perhaps I'll submit it somewhere.
@_date: 2012-02-19 02:34:23
Thanks for the feedback.  Let me know whether this helps to clarify it:  Mining plays an integral role in establishing consensus about who's sent bitcoins to who.  It prevents the "double spending" problem.  There are huge computational resources devoted to mining, which is basically generating random numbers.  NooShare is a proposed modification to the bitcoin protocol which would allow for some of those resources to be put towards computations with some other purpose, in return for the NooShare currency itself.

I published this to get feedback on the idea's overall feasibility and flaws in the design, and I've been getting some [good feedback]( so the document appears to already be accessible to the people I've been hoping would critique it.  I'm working on it because it excites me.  Academic acceptance would be very much a booby prize.

I've given serious thought to this problem, but I am by no means an expert on any aspect of it, and I welcome all critical feedback on all aspects of it.

Not closest, but "best," in the sense of returning the highest value from  a real-valued function R.


Yes, and NooShare has the same lottery, roughly speaking.  Each time a Monte Carlo result is generated from the current proto-block, it is hashed, and this hash value is compared to the threshold specified by the current difficulty value.  Results which generate low hash values are not otherwise very interesting, so there is a second competition encouraging miners to report the best results they generated while attempting to solve the block.  


A key innovation is that the algorithms embedded in the blockchain are *Monte Carlo*: basically you keep trying random variations of solutions until you find one closest to the properties you seek.  For a miner to win the blockchain lottery, they only need try random possibilities.  They don't need to solve the entire problem.


To some extent, this would likely depend on the dynamics of each Monte Carlo algorithm, but in general each participant's return from the secondary competition should be roughly proportional to the computational resources they've committed to mining.


Maybe.  The results reported in the secondary competition are signed in such a way that they can't be stolen directly, but in Markov-Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, they could be used to seed other results.   Of course, whoever generates a good result in the first place has presumably been running it through the Markov Chain for many iterations, so they have explored the neighboring space.  
Also, the prize for the secondary competition is an order of magnitude smaller than the prize for the blockchain lottery, so the best return will probably always come from mining the next block.  And the secondary competition does not need to be perfect, it just has to provide a positive incentive for miners to track and report their best results.  Even if the secondary prize was being sniped by post-hoc analysis 95% of the time, the incentive to report results would still be adequate.  From the perspective of making the network useful for arbitrary calculations, having people "cheat" by finding still better results is actually a benefit.
Most of your questions are covered in section "2.2.1 Encouraging miners to report the best results" but let me know if you'd like further details here.

Thanks, man. :)

That's correct, the transactions+the nonce, as with the bitcoin mining algorithm.


Almost.  The random numbers ("s" in the paper) are fed into a Monte Carlo algorithm ("A(s,d)" in the paper), and the result is hashed (call the  function H, and note that I am simplifying notation for clarity.)  The random number generated from that last hash is used in the blockchain lottery/proof of work.  I.e., if H(A(s,d)) is less than the threshold specified by the current difficulty, the block is solved.


H(A(s,d)) is just a random number, so just finding an s for which A(s,d) solves the block is not that interesting.  Roughly speaking, after the block is solved, all participants report the A(s,d) for which R(A(s,d)) is largest.  Here R is a metric on the quality of the result A(s,d).  Whoever reports the best result gets coins.  They have ten blocks to make the report after the block in which they generated the result.


There is one problem per block, specified by the algorithm A.


Let me know if I can clarify anything further.  The basic idea is simple, but the elaborations I've devised in my attempts to make it secure against cheating have made it more difficult to express.

No, there's a default hashing algorithm curly-A which miners can (and will by default) fail over to if R starts taking longer than ten times the average run time of curly-A, roughly speaking.  The next block can be solved with a hash by either algorithm, but the difficulty for a block solved by curly-A is ten times greater than for a block solved by R, so the creator of R has an incentive to make its runtime a bit less than ten times that of curly-A so that miners have an incentive to run R.  This is described more precisely in section "2.2.2 Adapting to prohibitively long runtimes for A".

Isn't it a little ironic to advise someone on a bitcoin forum that institutional legitimacy is a likely requirement for widespread adoption? :-)
I take your point, though.  I am going to keep writing things up as I go, and if I get to the point of marketing, find more accessible ways to present present NooShare's structure.  It may well lead to a publishable document, some day.

  &gt; how do you check that the result is correct without redoing all the work?
The key idea is that the proof of work computations are Monte Carlo.  Each iteration of the proof of work generates a random value, and the result depends on that random value.  Each computation included in the proof of work comes with a metric (called "R" in the paper) by which the results of the calculations are valued.  This metric is not used in the calculation which secures the blockchain, but after someone solves and reports a block, there is a secondary competition in which people report their best results (best w.r.t. this metric.)  Only the calculations yielding those best results and the calculations which meet the blockchain-lottery thresholds need to be checked by the entire network.  This requires essentially the level of rechecking as validation of the bitcoin blockchain does.  There will be a little more computation involved than that, but not much.  For more details, see section "2.2.1 Encouraging miners to report the best results" or ask me here.
