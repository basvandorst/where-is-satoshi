Everything is good...except for Telegram. It’s unreliable and not secure. Please useSignal instead next time. Otherwise, thx.

Fake news. We gotta buy up as much b4 these posers gain control. The winds of change be a blowing. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:37:30
Bernie or bust all the way. We gotta boycott Coinbase till they begin to listen to customers. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:25:00
TBD...join the event thru meetup
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:28:19
It’s already happening in Japan and China. Why won’t it happen soon?
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:15:41
No like I can’t make an encrypted connection to the physical site with a browser
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:39:35
What happens if u move all of that Bitcoin to a Trezor or some type of offline storage? Couldn’t u claim u ‘lost’ those bitcoins and just keep them? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:33:50
But I honestly think the overthrow of fiat is coming soon. Governments just can’t control Bitcoin or censor it. There are too many ways around their attempts. I’m a HODLer for life...I plan to settle debts and buy houses, cars, etc all in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:44:12
Dope...Bernie or Bust
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:31:23
so we'd be the new 1%? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:27:17
 
This is taxation without representation. The IRS is taxing ppl on a novelty item and trying to subjugate ppl to outdated rules. They’re scared of Bitcoin, so obviously they’ll want to tax the hell outta it. We need to lobby for Bitcoin and represent it in Congress for the sake of freedom.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:56:31
Anybody interested? If so we could mobilize thru reddit and as we gain more visibility, perhaps hold physical events.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:14:47
Which is why we gotta start a revolution with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:10:08
Any way to make Bitcoin as anonymous as Monero? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:46:28
No I mean just ppl coming together for a networking session.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:22:20
only thing is that the website doesn't support encryption, so I can't trust it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:16:51
We should not pay taxes until there is enough representation in Congress for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is freedom and no entity should take this away lightly unless everybody involved can be part of the solution. This is 1776 again...Taxation Without Representation.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:37:55
What happens if u spend all of ur bitcoins? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:35:15
This is why we as Bitcoiners need to band together and decide how best to protect our interests and Bitcoin’s freedoms against unnecessary oversight.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:33:52
At least use the YouTube link....don't make ppl pay more money for something that's free...
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:45:27
I've been saying this for weeks....it's about time we all come together and stand for Bitcoin and freedom.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:04:34
Bitcoin is a huge social experiment. It's goal is to bring freedom to how people control their own money, correct? Bitcoin can bring millions of people into the global economy. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:45:59
perhaps if everyone who wants this to happen lobbies Apple...
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:29:52
Bitcoin is socialist tho
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:17:54
Thanks very much for the advice! I'll be sure to check them out.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:17:13
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:29:15
Neither....someone hit me up and is shipping it out to me as we speak.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:14:25
I mean, Bitcoin is rare. It's going to appreciate rather quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:27:21
have you heard about any outages or planned maintenance? I've been trying to withdraw the past 2 days but nothing is happening. I'm pretty worried.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:02:29
Thx Satoshi 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:01:47
Typical cronie 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:43:50
this is upsetting. Who can I trust these days in the Bitcoin world?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:03:00
Just submitted my request. Thx for the quick response.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:20:56
So literally nothing can stop Bitcoin unless the nodes and the developers flake, rite?
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:46:10
true...but I really want my Bitcoins that I have on Kraken. They wouldn't steal my money, would they?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:46:11
I’ve been in contact with Kraken support, so I’ll let u know their response once I get it. For now, all we can do is just wait.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:36:42
but my Bitcoins are safe, rite? Kraken won't pull a Mt. Gox, would they?
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:16:44
This guy wreaks of arrogance and complacency.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:05:34
To me, I already paid you.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:33:32
no, but I don't even get the prompt. It keeps giving me Error 502 when I try click withdraw.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:47:39
so they're going to upgrade this coming December, like within the next month?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:15:07
That’s a clutch car
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:55:39
Definition of a hypocrite. I’m boutta close my account with them as well.
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:41:28
I don’t buy it. Nobody should be naive to the point that they believe these Fed statements. Unfortunately, enough people will believe he Fed when they say they won’t regulate, but secretly they’re prolly working on regulations. 
Don’t be naive...don’t trust the Fed. The day they get audited, I will give them the most minimal amount of credibility they deserve.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:49:27
I'd like the bitcoin vs bank shirt, white, small. Thx....ur the best. Great creativity
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:25:56
His website is not encrypted. Please do not trust this guy or give him any legitimacy.
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:46:48
I don't think that'll ever happen....like ever
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:56:14
Im hoping for these things in 2018:
1. Customers withdraw their money and close their accounts
2. Bank of America goes extinct
3. The Fed shuts itself down and gives every citizen who bailed out the banks a fair share of the rescue package
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:54:27
I continue to believe they're intricately tied together. Government is run by money, not ideals. I don't understand government at all, but 1 thing is for sure: they're coming for Bitcoin and HODLers.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:01:09
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:05:32
Either this is fake news and they are making regulations as we speak, or this is just a PR stunt to portray the Fed as a non-intrusive entity. Nothing helps Fed’s cause when it releases ‘news’ like this.
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:19:17
I can’t justify the price
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:44:53
It would be bad....real bad. USD would fall tremendously, credit rating would go down....hell, even the possibility of a default would be terrible.
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:13:24
How much?
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:33:39
Everyone should refuse to pay taxes until there is fair representation in Congress for HODLers. Taxation without Representation is happening all over again.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:39:12
We should be on SharkTank for giving him advice to buy bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:26:00
How? I don't see any lobbying groups, any talk of Blockchain...only small Congressional hearings that are used to give the public the impression that cryptocurrency is being "considered". This is a huge PR stunt! 
I'm calling it now, Uncle Sam and his cronies will be targeting HODLers simply because the national debt has become unbearable. Politicians and business elites have propped-up various segments of this economy and the USD to unsustainable proportions.
Taxing HODLers is just a way for Uncle Sam to make up for lost revenue and a failing financial system which nobody cares to reform or is too interested in protecting.
HODLers are seen as the "easy way out" for this government and more people should be outraged. Why not just print more money? Why not get rid of tax loopholes? So many good and bad actions can be taken, yet the government chooses to penalize HODLers for government failures.  
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:35:44
Eh....what I really mean is that I just think current events surrounding finance proves the power of bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:08:36
no way...policy is dictated by money, not speed. Why did DACA fail? Not enough donors to buy the votes. Why is environmental protection gone? Not enough donor money to defend it. Banks and special interests are lobbying to regulate Bitcoin. It's simple...Bitcoin threatens their very existence and "legitimacy".
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:59:29
So yes?
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:32:26
Strong password next time
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:49:27
Coinbase....it's legit and simple. Perfect for beginners.
@_date: 2017-09-25 00:38:09
Bitcoin over iPhone anyway. If Apple really wanted to be innovative, they would accept Bitcoin as payment and give us about 20% off the price.
