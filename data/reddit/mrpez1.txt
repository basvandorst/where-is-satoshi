Mining with a PC CPU hasn't been profitable for years. Mining with a PC GPU (for bitcoin) also hasn't been profitable for years. Mining with an ASIC is likely not profitable unless you have free electricity, a cheap source of ASICs and massive scale. Unless you are doing it for altruistic reasons, just don't mine bitcoin unless you meet these criteria. Much better bet to buy and hodl.

My withdrawal finally completed. Sold all my BFX as soon as trading started. At the end of the day my 6.1 BTC became 4.2.

This is relevant to my interests. if we never went through an explicit setup process are we not using Bitgo?

I'm a big believer in crypto and agree with this completely. Bitcoin could be part of a well diversified portfolio (including index funds) but not just bitcoin. You'll need to balance and adjust it over time. Don't just lock it away.

Bitgo charges a .1% fee for withdrawal. Why wouldn't I just use my recovery key and ledger to avoid that?

I’d say get some basic fiat savings/emergency funds in place first. 3-6 mos of living expenses in a nice safe bank account. Then dollar (euro) cost average ([DCA]( )on a weekly basis what you can afford. To be a good crypto investor, you need to take emotion out of the equation. Fear and greed are the two big ones. Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) is what you are dealing with now. This emotion makes you take out loans and buy at the local top. If you have all your assets in crypto (and owe monthly payments on a loan) and then watch it drop 20%-40%, you’ll feel panic. This will cause you to sell at the local bottom. 
Invest only what you can afford to lose. This is the only way you can ride through the volatility without making stupid calls in extreme situations. Never go all in.

Because it can/will go down. You will panic and sell at a bad time. Invest what you can afford to lose. You can’t afford to lose what you don’t have.

All this has happened before, and all this will happen again.

I have the same jaxx wallet on my phone and laptop. Also backup a seed. Little more attack surface but less white knuckle if one device blows up.

Much better deal to subscribe and save on Amazon. Use your Amazon store card and get 5% back. $27.45 for the case.

The banks were and still are (to a certain extent) very selective about who they will lend to. Lending standards became ridiculous after 2008. It was an over reaction to the stupid lax standards from 2004-2008. When my wife and I bought our first house in 2005, the lenders were telling us to buy a bigger house with a smaller down payment. In 2013, we got denied with a perfect app and stellar credit. We were able to get the deal done with a different lender but fuck Wells Fargo.
