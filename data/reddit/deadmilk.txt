Oh no, don't let the government find out about my trading

Many criminal offence

Well... Looks like I gotta reconfigure my stuff then.
What is the difference?

I looked at it, apparently you can pay your australian bills with it.
While that is cool to see that btc can pay for more things these days, I am fairly sure that I don't want to do that.

Per hash it's actually cheaper than the S5. The S5+ is currently the cheapest per hash.
But yeah, it'd be nice if there was more of a variety of miners with different configurations.

For AUD I use btcmarkets.net for buying.  
I sell on coinspot.com.au, but it is slow, and withdrawing your AUD can take 5 business days or so.  
If I wanted a quick sale so I could get the money back into my bank account, btcmarkets is decent enough, I just don't expect to make any profit from it unless I'm lucky and the price ramps up.

How new is new? It's been there a while.

Isn't Alaska in the US, therefore it should already work there?

I bought one. Might buy two. I pay flat price for rack space.

I forgot to mention, coinspot is okay because the low volume results in some people bidding at really dumb prices which equals profit for me.
But that site looks good, I'll keep it in mind next time
@_date: 2015-08-31 23:23:37
Fair enough.
I'm in Australia, so the site just says "NOPE" when I try anything at all.

Why would I use this shitty exchange anyway, when I can buy for approx $7/btc less on my favorite?
Is there something special about igot (if it is legit)? What are it's claims?
@_date: 2015-08-29 03:40:29
my* favorite
Literally, there is an exchange called "my favorite"
Check it out:

I think it's about time you cunts expanded to Australia too.

I very much doubt that this information is saved in memory. You'd have to search your disk for the address, maybe.
@_date: 2015-09-07 23:22:13
I doubt it logs that information. That'd be a HUGE security risk.
