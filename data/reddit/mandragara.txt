Imagine how the US will react when the average Chinese worker outearns the average American worker. WW3?

Firstly the boat ticket would probably sell for more than 22k
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:24:08
China needs the US to have money so that the US can afford to buy Chinese goods. It's a vicious cycle

Buy the dip!

Can't they just take the current chain at some arbitrary block and make that a new genesis block?

For someone to make a million, someone else needs to lose a million.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:10:04
That's a pissy compensation. Nowadays it'd be millions I reckon.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:26:12
Why? I don't quite understand. Can't the new genesis block just contain everyones wallets + their balances?

Could they be selling data on what the youngins are trading?

And what powers do these professional investors have? People are people right? Chaotic systems aren't predictable.

All they need is for someone to buy at some point between now and Jan.

Hate to break it to you, gold only has value because people think it has value.

I believe they can sell the future contract before it executes.

For all we know big money has already moved in and will manipulate the price. Wallstreet is full of experienced cut throats

True value is tied to utility. Food, water, shelter and so on.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:31:32
Good read. I bought at 16k a few days ago and I'm feeling a touch of regret.
Was expecting more manipulation from the future futures buyers

Excluding Metro, the Microsoft ecosystem is really nice, they have just done a terrible job of pitching it.

They only need to be right once for you to lose everything.
People said a black man couldn't be president until there was one

We all know we're in a bubble. The hope is we can get in and out without being burned. I sold all my BTC for ETH at 9K. Lets see how the second bubble fairs.

Time to buy shares in CME, woops I already did a year ago!
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:12:30
The Chinese use BTC to get their money out of China without paying the insane tax on it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:53:13


Exactly why you shouldn't buy them!
