It's really not.
It kinda is a bit sometimes if you live in the us or Canada.   But for most of the world ,  no that's not how it works.

If you are born to a family of crackheads who don't send you to school or teach you read and by the time you are 13 they start using you to sell dope, when you turn 18 and become an adult and that's all you know, how do you turn your life around? Watch resources on youtube? You don't have a computer, and youre squatting in a house without electricity.
Most people are born into their life and live the life their parents choose for them at birth, for good or bad. And its virtually impossible to realize the mistakes they made when you become old enough to think for yourself and change your life into something better.
Note this is for people with real problems, not redditors who are whining they don't want to get a job while they live in their rich parents basements. With them it is most certainly laziness and lack of willpower.

Yeah.  This virtual gold versus virtual cash idea is ridiculous.  Why not just store a tonne of the cash (as your long term holding vehicle) that has use and therefore value instead of gold that has no use but for some reason has value (for now)
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:30:15
Yes, gold does tangible value, as it is rare and useful to industry..
Virtual gold (ie bitcoin) has no purpose though. It has value simply because people want it to have value to be a new currency... but it cant work as a currency with 50 dollar transaction fees that take a week to process... so it has no value, people just haven't realized that yet.
Crypotcurrency is the future. But a virtual cash will win the war, not a virtual gold.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:06:54
But why do we need a virtual gold bitcoin commodity?   What purpose does that serve ?

Elections over. Hilarys been gone for two weeks, and nobody is going to hear anything from her again for either 3.5 years, or most likely, never again, as shes too old and failed too hard to run again.
Theres no reason to ever bring her up now.  He was stretching hard for any reason to bring up anti Hilary propaganda.
But either way, I'm pretty sure your purposely trolling, so whatever.

Gold bars, you can take a chisel to for free and shave a tiny bit off and take it to a jewler or whatever who will weight it and exchange it for cash for zero fee. Or at least you could in the 1800s, maybe you could today.
I'm a btc fan, I'm just saying. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:47:56
But why do we need digital gold? I need a digital daily transaction currency. And you know, I can store a shit tonne of it as my gold if necessary, if I choose to.
@_date: 2017-01-20 02:05:15
Yeah, I realized that, and I realize keys can be lost. But did Satoshi lose all his keys or something? Or is this just because he basically disappeared in 2010 and people assume he died, and is not just sitting on a mountain of coins somewhere that he forgot about?

Jesus fucking Christ trump won.  You won the election.  It's over.  You can't use hilary as an excuse or distraction anymore.  Trump has to stand on the validity of his ideas now. He cant just justify everything by saying "hilary did something bad too" or "hilary would be even worse".  
All I see from trump fans is nonstop hilary bashing.  She's a bad person. I agree.  So what.  She's just a regular citizen now.  Now move on and start talking about all the good things trump is supposedley going to do, if they exist.
@_date: 2017-01-09 02:08:05
I'm not even Americam I'm just sick of reddit being filled with antihilary comments.   I don't like her either.  But fuck... your only policy can't be "my opponent sucks".  
I wouldn't care if every other post was describing why trump is good because that's at least content.  But it's time to stop beating this dead horse.

The fact that youre using the word triggered means you are probably trolling.

The guy I originally responded to took a random comment, and brought it around to complaining about Hilary.


I do need to go outside though. Been bedridden with the flu for three days now.
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:22:00
Sorry, all hopped up on flu medication and just annoyed that every other post on reddit for the last three days Ive been in bed has a trump complaint, followed by a trump supporter defending said complaint by insulting Hilary and not addressing the actual issue.
I know 80% of the are just 4chan troll and Russian server farm monkeys, but it got to me in my drugged out state.
Sorry if I offended anyone.

A country already exists without government. Its Somalia.  Those people are free to move there, and not pay taxes, and be murdered by a warlord who like their tshirt within a week.  If they don't starve to death in that time period since theres no food.  And good luck selling your bitcoins when the power goes out for days at a time every week and spikes and surges blowing up your electronics.  Theres a million other downsides I don't have time to write down now, but think about it for a few minutes or do some googling.

A country already exists without government. Its Somalia.
It is nothing like what you think it would be.  It is a hellhole of misfortune and suffering. No infrastructure, no reliable energy, no health care, no consistent source of food, constant bands of warlords stealing what little there is from everyone else and each other, everyone living in fear over all the constant crime.

Awfully hostile for a person claiming to not be hostile and awfully quick responses from a person who supposedly gave up on this conversation 12 hours ago.

Were not convincing you. Were convincing the couple thousand readers who come here and read this thread and your bullshit and might actually believe you are onto something. Its them we need to show that, no , this guy is not a genius, he is a selfish bastard with no foresight.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:50:54
I think you vastly overestimate how much gets done without a government. Go look at Somalia for an example of what a country without a government is really like.

That's my only problem.  People call it digital gold.  And say that other coins will be the digital cash. 
But in my mind,  why can't you just hold more of the digital cash as your gold?  If other people devide this too they will get out of btc and it's value will plummet.
I am by no means an expert but btc needs to be digital cash to succeed.

No they said many times in interviews in 1999 and 2000 in the original version humans were cpus but the studio made them change it to batteries to be simpler.
