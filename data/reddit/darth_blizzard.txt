The crypto market as a whole is up 20 billion in the last 24 hours.  If your theory is correct.  Where did the other $19,900,000,000 come from?

Wouldn’t this crash the price? Or show the non crypto investors that there is no stable liquidity for trading?  And it will Scare away the institutional investors right before bakkt goes live.  
This is a bad idea and bad for crypto in general 
If this does happen it will be less than .001% of all mined Btc because real investors don’t play games.

All I’m saying is that the media is manipulating this data.  
Could it be possible they care more about clicks and ratings than facts?
This is a super click bate “news” item
