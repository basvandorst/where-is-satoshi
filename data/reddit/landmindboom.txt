It's just haters and folks who have wealth via traditional means.
It's the same people who didn't understand how Facebook or Twitter or Snapchat could be monetized. The same people who think network TV will never die and YouTube is a passing fad. The same people who don't trust shopping online.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:39:11
Welp, you just *coined* a new phrase.

Had 31 BTC back in 2010. I used it to pay a prostitute (who I found out later gave me chlamydia). 
I bought back in at $19k, panic sold at $13500. 
Now I'm cashing out my 401K and putting everything into Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:54:28
BIG buy coming.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:59:07
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:05:29
Obvious BTC hating troll is obvious as he is Russian. Go away Putin, we're earning lambos!
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:54:13
Sell all your possessions now and buy. You'll have a garage full of Lambos buy Xmas. Remember, BTC can only go up. Fiat money is dying.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:49:06
100% lock

Trick question. Don't invest in anything but The Lambomaker (i.e. Bitcoin)

We just sold my wife's fake tits on Craigslist to buy .03 BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:57:24
Don't get impatient. The price is VERY strong  in the wake of the futures opening. **BIG** buy coming tomorrow morning.
We'll see an all time high tomorrow. 21k. Correction on Tuesday. Back up toward 25k on Wed.
Buy and hold. This is for real and even Wall Street knows it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:19:58
I'm going to pay for cryonics with mine. Working on finding a reliable way to store them for when I'm revived.
Honestly, this is not just the investment of a lifetime...it's the investment of perpetual lifetimes **IF YOU HODL AND PLAN CORRECTLY**.

This isn't fair. I was promised lambos.

Early futures news is positive. Big moment for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:28:40
Do you want a Lambo and a hot girlfriend with huge fake tits?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:02:37
Coingrub pays in foreign hookers. Bitmarkk pays in gold bricks.
Cryptup gives you the option of hookers, gold, cocaine or gift cards for Cheesecake Factory.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:18:50
Not anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:04:22
For those deciding whether or not to buy...
Ask yourself: Do I want lambos?
If yes, then buy BTC now before it's too late!
If no, why are you the way you are? Honestly?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:02:42
It's like regular linearity except quite a bit more linear.

**HODL** if you want a Lambo.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:48:57
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:55:16
Should be worth about $100k by Jan 1. Then you can hire a private firm to manage your riches.
Just worry about picking out a Lambo that suits your style.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:14:15
Step 1: Get servers
Step 2: Get some wires
Step 3: Connect servers to cryptocurrency mine somewhere on the internet or something
Step 4: ???
Step 5: Pick out Lambo
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:58:28
Buy at least $1000 while you can.

Don't actually sell your kidneys. OMG see a therapist it's a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:16:22
Thank you for saying what we're all thinking.
I bought .01 BTC yesterday and was told I'd have my Lambo by now.
This is all Obama's fault, probably.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:18:30
This really is a buy and long term hold play for the majority of folks here at this point. Taking your $500 or $1000 or $2500 or $50,000... and believing that the tech has the legs to transform the nature of currency...and that belief paying out at a life-changing multiple.
I don't give a single fuck about doubling or tripling my money. I'm holding like all the motherfuckers who got rich by holding for 5 years. I'm holding--and buying every week--until this thing takes off. 
The haters and the guys who got rich off old money will shit on this the whole way. They've been doing it since 2009. I've watched a few people I know get rich and leave me in the dust with nothing to comfort me but my skepticism.
Not again. I'm **HODLING**.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:21:34
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:53:37
Mail them a Polaroid. Wait 6-8 months for processing. BTC price will be $100k by then, so save your money.

@_date: 2017-12-11 14:03:36
The only question left is... What color Lambo do you want?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:09:41
Give us this day our daily thread...
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:40:37
Just opened a Lambo dealership to sell the ones I'm not using. I accept Bitcoin ONLY!
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:29:57
Coingrub or Bitmarkk will do up to $10 mill a day if you want to go to Dubai. I prefer Cryptup when I'm in the US. A little slower but more secure.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:34:27
I can't. Google can.
It appears to be a barrier to the price moving above that level.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:40:14
$24 million
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:46:26
Just sold my kids and buying 1.5 BTC. How many Lambos will I have by Xmas??
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:24:26
We're selling her kidney next. Trying to get a lambo. Hodl, boys.

I'm okay with that, as long as you hodl it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:31:39
Going up nice and steady. Too legit to quit.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:11:18
A few hundred?? That'll buy you a fleet of lambos in a few months.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:21:02
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:28:56
Do you think 17k is the top? 25k? 100k? 1 million...for the pioneer in digital currency?
Do you want to be watching on the sidelines when everyone is driving in the Lambo parade, with busty models on their laps?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:59:54
Read. No one outside the frenzy thought the price would go up after futures opened. This is legit. 
Tomorrow will be am ATH. Correction on Tuesday. Back up toward 25k on Wed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:59:48
Try Gustomonkey.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:36:22
What if it's at 25k by Wed? 
Most of us waited too long to get rich from 1k to 10k... I'm not making that mistake again.

This is gonna be a great night, boyz!

Not unless you have a time machine.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:00:36
It's the newest cryptocurrency. You can get it for $0.000245 on Coingrub.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:12:47
Just send me your bank account info and CC number and I'll make sure everything works out for both of us.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:15:58
Oh, I'm zooming... in my fucking Lambo.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:28:48
Don't worry.
That will all be just pennies in the past when we're cruisin' around in our Lambos.
Buy and Hodl.

Wow. What a dumbass you married.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:47:10
Right. I'm trolling saying BTC is down $10k while ETH is up nearly 3x in the same time.
Is it also trolling to say water is wet or the sky is blue on r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:53:59

@_date: 2018-02-02 12:59:59

$7800 and dropping. 
"Perfectly reasonable" 
They knew this drop was coming.
Omg. Please keep posting. You can't get better comedy than the delusional drivel you type.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:04:19
The delusion is honestly amazing.
r/bitcoin is the best comedy on the web right now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:35:44
Because I'm too smart to buy into the delusion?
You think this is 2013?
BTC got exposed during this last run. It's too slow and expensive to keep up.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:15:45
It's always easy to spot the BTC sheeple during its crashes. They're mad at common sense and ready to lash out at anyone providing it.
Sleep well tonight with your $8800 bitcoins. If you decide you want to sell tomorrow, you're gonna have to start your transfer tonight so it has time to process.
Hopefully you'll have some money left after the fees...
God I love reddit.
