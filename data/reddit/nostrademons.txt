Moto X is currently clean - it's basically the stock Android experience plus a couple Motorola utilities that you'll actually like (hands-free unlocking, wiggle to take a picture, automatically detect when you're driving).  Not sure what'll happen to them now that Google no longer owns them, but for now the Moto X is the most convenient Android phone on the market.

The point with the Moto X is that it's better in all the ways that *ordinary people care about*.  Better battery life, better form factor in the hand, smaller, easier to unlock, shows time and notifications as soon as you pick it up.  They made a conscious decision to trade-off specs for that, so yes, it has a weaker processor and smaller screen.  I wouldn't say "more open to developers" though - both are stock Google experience.

"HODL" is a pretty good strategy for telling *other* people what to do, though, since it decreases the supply of Bitcoin on the market and makes the price keep going up.  If you sell while other people hold, you get to reap the benefits of the increased price while shifting the risk of a crash onto other people.
Lotta people gonna be kicking themselves when this bubble bursts, though.

True.  Blockchains have their own merits aside from TPS throughput.  The OP, however, \*was\* putting that data into a relational database, and by relational database scales it's not \*that\* large.

Just a hunch, but try setting innodb\_flush\_log\_at\_trx\_commit=0 (assuming you're using InnoDB, which you should be).  Without that flag MySQL needs to fsync() on every transaction, which requires a disk seek, and your disk is limited by its physical rotation speed (SSDs can help here).  With it MySQL will batch up lots of writes at once and only flush them once per second, which can give a several orders-of-magnitude speedup.
Using LOAD DATA INFILE or extended INSERTs instead of a single INSERT statement for each row can help significantly as well.
SQL databases have all sorts of performance pitfalls, and if you don't know what you're doing you can easily kill your performance.  But the total size of the Bitcoin blockchain is 185G, which is big by consumer standards but peanuts by most Internet business standards.  (In 2013 Google was processing about an exabyte/month in just logs analysis jobs, for example, which is roughly 6 million times bigger than the entire Bitcoin blockchain today.)

Not the web data that's been around for 20 years; the data that's generated by Google's \*usage logs\*, i.e. the queries and requests that people enter in a given month and data that's derived from that.  (The velocity is close to a million-fold as well; there are Google services that get a million queries \*per second\*, while the Bitcoin network does about 7 TPS.)

If you're hoping to sell it in the next couple months, you may have some trouble.
If you're just going to hold onto it or spend it through the network, it doesn't.

Progressive != communist, or even socialist.  The progressive era in the US gave us antitrust law, women's suffrage, unions, scientific management, and the League of Nations (later UN) - and less successfully, the Federal Reserve, income tax, Prohibition, and eugenics.  Later waves of progressivism also brought us the Civil Rights Act, birth control, and EPA.
The point the grandparent's making is that if you never try anything new, you never make progress, and you end up quickly eclipsed by societies that do.  There will be some bad policies mixed in with the good policies, but the bad policies can be rolled back later while the good policies get widely adopted by other states that are taking a wait-and-see approach.  We know that price controls, planned industrial production and state ownership of land don't work - but realistically, nobody (even in California) is suggesting that.  We have pretty good evidence (from most of Western Europe, Canada, and Taiwan) that single-payer health care *does* work, but a lot of questions about how it would apply to a diverse, capitalistic, individualist society like the U.S.  Until somebody tries it we're never going to find the answers to those questions.

The huge difference is that when a hedge fund goes bust the owners don't have to pay back the money.

Not for the folks who bought at the ATH of $31.91 in 2011 and sold at the ATH of $1200 in November 2013 (~4000%), or the folks who bought then and sold at the ATH of $19K in December 2017 (~1500%).

Ah, but then you need to answer *when* the correction will happen, and when will you jump in?  It could happen this summer, in which case waiting will make you look like a genius.  Or it might not happen for another 5 years and the market will have doubled by then, like they did over the last 5 years.  If it's the latter scenario, you might easily get 4 years in, lose your nerve, realize you could've made hundreds of thousands of dollars in free money if you'd only invested in 2018, and buy in at the top.

A lot of the wages come from the bagholders who bought in at the top and are now posting here regretting it.  More comes from folks who are continuing to DCA into the market even though the price is down.
For everyone who lost money in Bitcoin, that money didn't just disappear.  They *traded* it away for various cryptocurrencies.  Some of it went to long-time whales who bought their Bitcoin in 2010-2015; these folks are now enjoying their lambos and tropical vacations.  A lot went to CoinBase, which made a *billion* in revenue in 2017, and other exchanges.  Some of it went to miners who used it to pay for electricity, for hardware, and for engineers.  But a lot of it went into ICOs - when you hear that $6B was raised by various ICOs in 2017 (somewhat misleading, because it's paper numbers from the peak), that money didn't come from nowhere.  It came from an ICO who traded their token for Ethereum, and traded Ethereum for Bitcoin, and traded Bitcoin for cash which is sitting in a corporate bank account being used to pay crypto engineer salaries.
The smart ones, at least.  The dumb ones kept their ICO funds in an Ethereum wallet and are now fighting over the cash coming from the few people who are still DCAing into Ethereum, which is a large reason why the price keeps driving lower.  They're the ones doing layoffs now.
If the smart ones are as good at product design &amp; engineering as they are about timing the market, then in a year or two we might see actually-useful crypto ecosystems, and the folks who held onto their ICO tokens will become wealthier than the Bitcoin whales who sold in this last bubble could believe.  Everybody else gets a lesson about irrational exuberance and the randomness of markets.
