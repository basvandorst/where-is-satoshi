Everyone spunked their wad on over 9,000 memes, and probably didn't expect 20k to come around quite this soon.

You should be able to see all your transactions on your Coinbase account. Are you sure you didn't send it to another wallet?

It's never too late. I don't know why people get the idea it's too late because they never bought a whole coin for $100.

This. I've had my fingers burnt once selling via PayPal on Localbitcoins. I lost over £700.

The clever people who have will hodl. The clever people who don't have will buy soon/now.

There's also nothing stopping governments from investing in Bitcoin, in which case they'd want it to thrive.

Are you friends with Glenn Hodl?

I sent one earlier today without paying attention at ~5.8 sat/B. It's very frustrating, but it's only between my own wallets.

It's never too late. The rollercoaster never ends.

If you're curious, invest what you can afford to lose, and the sooner the better. Same as any other investment, really. It's just that with bitcoin, the return is evidently outweighing the risk now and for the foreseeable future.

HODL, and possibly buy.
