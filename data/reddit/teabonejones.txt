When I get home, I'm gonna load some doge into my dogetipbot and tip the fuck out of you so you can feel the power of the doge

Wow. Thanks!

Oh. Well that makes a lot more sense. I was under the impression one could sell multiples at one price .

How would they crash the price before selling them? If they sold them all at once, wouldn't they receive however much they sold in USD, then the price would crash?

DeBeers wouldn't do that simply because diamonds are almost their sole means of making money. Walmart would be receiving USD from all their stores, and also bitcoin from online. They could easily sell all their thousands of bitcoins and make more USD from it. Why would they care if bitcoins crashes? They made their money from it.

I thought about that, but that person is spending their USD on stock, then selling their stock at a higher price in USD. 
With this, Walmart is just receiving bitcoin (not spending USD on it) for their products and then selling them at once. 
If someone gave me 30% of the shares in a company (i didn't spend any USD on them), then I could easily sell them and make a ton of cash and crash that company. I might hold on to it for a while and let the price grow, but if it looks like the price is stagnating, then I could sell and crash it. No USD lost on my part, since the stock was given to me. No USD lost on Walmart's part, because the bitcoins were given to them.

So it isn't possible to sell multiples at once? Like, I couldn't sell 4,000 bitcoins right now at $93 for $372,000? The price would decrease after each one sold?

I understand almost nothing about it, which is why I'm asking these questions. I'm trying to understand more. Can you please explain to me why it is nearly impossible?

I think this actually explains pretty well why they wouldn't just hold all their bitcoins. The shareholders will punish them.
@_date: 2013-04-01 01:12:45
Right, I get that. But what happens when they have thousands saved up, and they decide to sell them all in one day, crashing the value of bitcoin?
Basically, what's stopping them from doing that?

Thanks. That actually clears a lot of things up.
