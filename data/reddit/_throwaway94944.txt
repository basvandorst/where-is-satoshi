This community gets incredibly pedantic if you're not just smoking hopium. If you're going to police my language, why not offer a suggested alternative? What word should I have used? Instance?

It seems to me that there is a linguistic necessity to differentiate between the Bitcoin protocol, the Bitcoin blockchain and the Bitcoin currency. Calling all of these 'Bitcoin' is quite confusing. People were trying to solve this before Bitcoin Cash was even a thing. Many people called the BTC blockchain 'Bitcoin Core' because it was based on a node system that runs through a client called Bitcoin Core. The name didn't emerge with the emegence of BCash.
Unfortunately the BCash debacle seems to have thrown everyone for a loop. Heck, it's almost scandelous to refer to BCash as "Bitcoin Cash" here, as you did. The terminology has now been politicised to the point where it no longer makes sense, and we're going to need to throw out a tonne of linguistic rules.
Also to follow from your Britain example, I think a better parallel than the US revolt is if someone called Britain the UK, and someone else called it Great Britain. Both parties know what they're talking about, they're just angry because the other guy didn't use their preferred nomenclature.

Okay, so genesis block, block 2, block 3, skip a few blocks and we decide to patch Bitcoin. There are now two instances of the Bitcoin blockchain, one registering xyz transactions as valid, and another registering only zy as valid. The original unpatched version is surely just as 'Bitcoin' as the other. Different people just have different ideas of what set of rules that they wish to follow. The standard way to refer to such divergences is to call this a fork. Bitcoin soft forks all the time. Handling soft forks is one of the core features of blockchain technology.
The term 'fork' has been needlessly politicised in the Bitcoin space.

This is heading in the direction of secure. With a thirds solution (as opposed to halves), you're protected against disasters. You can store a copy of part A and C at your own home, B and C at a trusted family member's home, as well as A and B at another location. 
Any two will give you access to the full private key so a copy can be lost or destroyed without risk.

Why would we celebrate banks holding patents for Bitcoin infrastructure anyway? Increased adoption isn't worth the negative of having bank involvement. Slower growth without banks is better than rapid growth with banks.

Should we trust and verify that r\\Bitcoin moderators are volunteers who are not funded or otherwise engaged in a conflict of interest? Have you made any attempts at transparency around that, which I may not be aware of? Sincere question; apologies if this comes across as standoffish.

What do you call it when Bitcoin upgrades, and the past version of Bitcoin is not accepted as valid anymore? If you don't consider that a fork, we might as well just scrap any standard computer science linguistics while discussing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-20 01:35:18
I'd rather no increased adoption until a robust peer-to-peer solution is found for less technically savvy people. If BoA launches a custodial wallet, it's just a matter of time until that wallet is compromised. If BoA loses crypto to hackers, for the average person that will mean that Bitcoin itself is hackable.

A lot of printers have previous print orders saved in memory. You'd want to hope that the random underpaid employee working at the store doesn't recognise it as a private key and steal your coins.

It seems to me that "Bitcoin is Bitcoin" is just a zealous way of saying "my fork is the only real fork". Given my downvotes, it does seem scandalous to call the main Bitcoin chain "Bitcoin Core", though frankly that's ridiculous. I don't see why it's scandalous to call the main chain of Bitcoin, which originated through Bitcoin Core nodes, 'Bitcoin Core'.

What evidence is there to support your claim that 30 million people own Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-23 06:53:58
I feel like I'm talking to a wall that's feeling particularly obtuse. Bitcoin and BCash are both &lt;x&gt;.
What is the underlying word that you would use to describe the similiarity. I get that you some of you lovely people call everything under the sun that relates to the Bitcoin protocol Bitcoin. What is the community preferred nomenclature that acknowledges the fact that Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash are both divergent/instances/yourwordhere of the same fundamental technology?
@_date: 2019-08-23 05:25:22
How am I being a hypocrite? To be a hypocrite I would need to advocate one thing and do another. I am doing the thing that I am advocating for (I don't see a reason to limit myself to just one cryptocoin). As an example of hypocrisy: your user name is 'givethought', yet you clearly do not give thought to your comments prior to posting.
@_date: 2019-08-23 07:26:35
Now we're just redefining what the word "fork" means. If Bitcoin has ever been upgraded, it has forked.

I'm not from that cesspool, I just don't tend to believe that a victimless crime that a person did their time for should be used as evidence that a person is capable of completely unrelated crimes.

Do whatever the fuck you want with your Bitcoin. It's your Bitcoin. Even if you want to spend it on boot spurs when you've never stepped foot on a ranch, I ain't gonna judge you. It's your shit. You do whatever you want with it.

If you're going to split keys, do it in thirds rather than halves. Have part A and B in one location, B and C in another, and A and C in yet another. This way you need two locations to be compromised (same security as halves) but have the added advantage that a piece can be lost or destroyed without compromising the key.

I've got no love for Ver, and believe a lot of the nastiness said about him.
However, let's not lose sight of the fact that the dude's incarceration was for selling firecrackers. The US has the highest incarceration rate in the world, so I'm not going to judge the dude for having a non-violent crime on his record. It seems like everyone in the US is just one bad encounter with a cop away from being behind bars.

I certainly don't find any comfort in knowing that the highest volume trade pairs are USDT based. What's to stop the people operating Tether from buying BTC with Tether that isn't backed by anything?
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:20:36
I don't think you've managed to follow the context of this thread. You're even suggesting that I don't know what crimes Ver is involved with, when I explicitly said "\[I\] believe a lot of the nastiness said about him". Anyways, have fun baselessly calling people shills. It's definitely a good way to make the community stronger.

$10k\~ is 125x $80. Through regular faucet use, you probably would'be made like $2, which would now be worth like $180. Power bill money, not power ball money. Don't beat yourself up.

Do you believe that Bitcoin so fragile that a screenshot of a Twitter post can damage its look?
Also, whinging about reposts says more about your Reddit usage than anything else. There are 1.1m people subbed here and chances are a lot of them haven't seen it.

I made the mistake of using Bitcoin as a currency. If your intention is to use it as an investment vehicle, the only rational strategy seems to be: buy and hold.

You are far more optimistic than I could ever be. I assume the worst of banks and reality still manages to disappoint me.

If you're having 1% gains per day, you're still going to get "bubble" talk. While much healthier, that's still an enormous amount of growth.
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:09:43
Thanks for your insight. A lot to consider in your post. Definitely true that my major concern is that the price is being artificially inflated through the introduction of false demand. If you can create Tether out of nothing, you'll be able to make the price rise. You can then stop the flow, and make the price fall. Sure, other groups could manipulate the price as well, but I don't think we're at the point where governments are trying to buy up all the Bitcoin yet.
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:31:58
Let's not forget that Bitcoin is also highly speculative and far more volatile than fiat currencies. Like, you do you, but to imply there's no risk on your end is misguided.

The issue is that Bitcoin (and crypto in general) has become a get rich quick scheme for many. I imagine that very few people who buy Bitcoin can even wrap their minds around the concept of using it as a currency. While it has more underlying value than a beanie baby, it's very much capturing the hearts and minds of that audience.
