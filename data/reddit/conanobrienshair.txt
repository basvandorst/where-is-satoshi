Where's the actual content of the post?  
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:57:47
You must be new here. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:59:36
My bad. I forgot bitcoin was created so we'd have another payment method that's just as expensive as the existing ones.  
Changing the world, right?

Hey new guy. I don't know if you were here a few years ago, but back then, $0.37 was considered absurdly high. 
All the fees back then were less than a nickel. Anything higher was considered "bitcoin failing to do what it was made to do". 
History lessons are severely lacking around here.

Move over Antonopoulos.  Karpeles is my new Bitcoin man-crush.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:39:58
Yeah.  Its hilarious to me that so much effort is put into childish mud slinging by supposed "adults" instead of just completely destroying Bitcoin Cash by raising the block size.  That's all you had to do from Day 1 folks... because that's the only reason they're here in the first place.  You refused to.

You must be miserable considering its $1,600 now.

How do I know the size of the transaction?  
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:20:02
You said I need to know the size of the transaction.
I can't know the size of the transaction before I execute it.
Going to blockchain.info won't tell me the size of a transaction that hasn't happened yet.

Crypto is useless if it cant be used by anyone.   What good is decentralization on a coin that can't be used?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:43:20


Total and complete misinformation lie.  It is exactly what satoshi envisioned, including the "server farms".   It is peer to peer cash, cheap and fast.  You guys want a bitcoin that can't be used, is expensive to transfer value, and takes 24+ hours to do so.  That is antithetical to Satoshi's vision in every way, shape, and form.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:45:18


Exactly.  And the childish troll accounts literally saturating this thread are what pushed me towards the other sub in the first place.  
All Bitcoin Cash seeks to do is make Bitcoin usable as a cheap, fast, transfer of value.  Its originally intended purpose.  Its backers include many of the OG's including Satoshi's right hand man - Gavin Andresen.   
A bunch of people here don't want that, so they spend all day character assassinating, mocking Roger Ver in youtube videos like children, and blatantly lying to people who are too lazy to research.
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:18:18
I thought Bitcoin was not supposed to be used to buy and sell things anymore.  I've read that frequently on this sub.  Very confusing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:46:49


Well that depends on whether the audience is a bunch of childish, unprofessional, idiotic children or not, now doesn't it?  Yes.  Yes it does...

Pretty much everybody who posts here comments that they've been summarily dismissed by Support. That's why they come here. 
Every report I've seen lately has included "and they told me the case was closed". 
That's why they come here. 
So the question the guy asked you remains. Why are people running into this from your support team? This isn't about high-volume and impatience all the time. Sometimes your team just tells people to kick rocks. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:20:30


Just shut the fuck up already would you?  Nobody with an IQ over four agrees with half of the shit you say.  Stop talking.  The fact that you're intellectually incapable (or just plain full of shit and dishonest) about this issue speaks volumes for how you view all of reality.  You may not agree with Ver, but on no planet is that guy a "malicious actor" out to harm bitcoin.  At least not consciously.  Enough already with this childish bullshit.  Grow up.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:01:08
Can't explain it? 
People are cashing in their other holdings for BTC, so that they get as many fork coins as possible during the forks. 
A first grader could figure this out. Expect the price to go back down after the forks. Has nothing to do with BCH "failing".  
I'm a long-term holder of BCH, and I cashed every bit of it in for BTC because you have to be retarded not to at this point in time. 
I will fully cash out back to BCH afterwards.
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:24:24
Nice attempt at the whole NO2X campaign writeup, but it wont amount to a hill of beans as this plays out.
You can tell your "friend" that as well.  And everyone you sat down and coordinate this writeup with.  
You guys will realize soon enough that your audience, and supporters are in the painfully small minority now.  You've already ostracized the entire industry and banned 75% of the community.  
What a waste of energy, as you will see.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:18:18
Might be happening?
You mock BCH and it's proponents like a bunch of fifth graders yet you don't have a basic grasp on market behaviors in the context of two upcoming forks.  
I dare say most of you aren't intellectually equipped to be making an assessment of which implementation of Bitcoin should be criticized in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:39:11
You are talking to a bunch of monumental idiots. Try not to invest too much energy on them.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:19:10
Right. When you have a narrative you have to promote. Fuck reality, when you've got bias. Right?
@_date: 2017-05-20 04:18:09
LOLLLLL.   So douchey and yet so great!  
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:15:15
Hmm.   Okay I'll bite.

Right, because people can't do more than one thing with their lives..
That's it.   That's the entire list.  I see no indication of "hilariously fake" anywhere.

I'm not seeing the 50 BTC transaction on this address.  Can you point me to it?  I was definitely doing those volumes on Coinbase back then when BTC was at $94, but yeah - I was thinking Mtgox ... can't be mtgox .... hope its not mtgox ... lol .. 
So check this out - right around January 2015 is when I put that address into BitPay as my settlement address.  The balance of the account was 0 BTC at that time .... 
You can see from that point forward - no in and out ... only deposits from sales on my store.  And dammit ... maybe $500 in deposits but now worth $10,000 .... 
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:08:54
Hmm wait - this particular address only received 1 BTC.
A different address received 49 BTC.
Now im really confused - why was it split up between the two?
Also says the total received to the address for all time is only 14 BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-23 03:41:31
Thanks so much - yeah I've spent the last 6 hours today trying to dig deep into my memory and into my email histories and everything.  Its incredible what you can find when you're motivated.
I can say this much:  Its not one of my bitaddress.org paper wallets because it has many deposits, followed by withdrawals.  I only used those for hoarding.  
Interestingly all the deposits have 100% equivalent withdrawals soon after.  If I put in 0.4 BTC and then 0.6 BTC a week later, some time after this exactly 1 BTC would come out.   If 1 BTC went in, 1 BTC would come out later.   
This is interesting behavior to be honest.  I am not sure what scenario this would've included.  Especially at dollar amounts as high as 1 BTC or sometimes 2 (still a few hundred dollars back then).  
It can't be Circle, because the first date is long before Circle existed.  So that's out.
It almost *has* to be Coinbase, but its simply not listed in my historic wallet addresses there   Back in Aug 2013 there weren't many options around.
More importantly, I know myself well enough to know that whatever address I chose, it would've been something extremely stable and long-term.  Because it was to be used for ongoing deposits from my online store sales.  I wouldn't have used some fly-by-night random address I had access to at the time.
Love mysteries!   But only if I can solve them :)
So there's no way to know "This is a Coinbase address" ?
