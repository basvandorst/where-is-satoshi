Go to blockchain.info and watch the transactions go by and see all the blocks being mined.
That is like saying a restaurant is dead because the line outside is too long. Yes we have a problem but the it is better than the problem BCH has - &lt; 100KB blocks on average. No adoption.

If you used an RBF wallet like GreenAddress, you could up your fee. But I would wait. The fees are a bit high right now.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:15:50
1. Never fucking sell unless you really need the money.
2. Trading is a losing proposition unless you are a genius.
3. Only stare at the charts when it is going up. Ignore them on the downtrends.
4. Create and manage your private keys from an offline computer (never connect to the internet) using bitaddress.org
5. Be psychologically prepared for an 80% pullback that lasts 2 years and never sell.

Straw man fallacy:
Bitcoin was already dead in the water as a true currency due to the fact it takes about 30 minutes to confirm a transaction. You can put a much lower fee and it will eventually confirm if you can wait.
Try out the LN with instant confirmation at yalls.org.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:24:20

Are you delusional? 17 of the last 20 blocks were full.
Not like BCH and the alts. Their blocks are empty because nobody uses them.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:02:47
17 out of the last 20 blocks were full, driving up fees. A one-time block size increase to get us by until lightning kicks in seems very reasonable. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:59:10
The amount of transactions in Monero is so small, tracing these payments is trivial. A lot of Monero blocks are empty.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:09:21
There ya go!

Did this. Instant. Freaking A. Cant wait to see the look on Ver’s face.

Forkologic be like:
1. Transaction fees are too high. Bitcoin is dead.
2. Transaction fees are low. Clear evidence Bitcoin is dead.

Did you use a wallet that does RBF? I would resubmit with 200 sat/byte fee if you need it now. Otherwise just wait.
Lightning should hopefully fix all this. You can try it out at yalls.org.

Guys, Rog is not a technical guy. He is a salesman. He is just parroting what his technical peeps are telling him (which is false). 
Go easy on my boy, Rog. He is as oldschool BTC as it gets. I disagree with him but I still respect him.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:13:02
I think you are right so I sent some you too !

This. Once you get paid in bitcoin and can buy whatever you want in bitcoin, no need for exchanges.

I think the point is they chased down a bug in someone elses code. Impressive.

Say what you will about his view towards BTC, broski is a brilliant developer. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:46:58
By xpub, do you mean public key? Can you send a link of what you are looking at on Trezor? It might help diagnose.

I love the marketing term for premine. It is now an "author's retention." Hahah

Jamie espouses the Sunk Cost Fallacy. Bitcoiners already paid the price for their Bitcoin when they bought it. These aren’t like options where you can lose more than your initial investment. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:00:50




Hmm. Well both legacy and segwit addresses come from core. And they both have public keys. So I guess a good question is: Where did you see that segwit "accounts" don't have public keys?
Also if you could post a link to the transaction, that could help too.
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:46:22
I had to bump the fee from 0.05$ to 0.28$ because someone is "filling up" the mempool.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:57:45
But muh flippening
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:00:09
Sound money and premined ICO scamcoin. Good contrast. Which is scarier?
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:24:17
This assumes the market will instantly jump to your new altcoin. The market is happy with Bitcoin. To get people to switch, you gotta be 10x better.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:52:44
But "THE FLIPPENING"?

This will be the real flippening.
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:28:30
Platinum is superior to gold in many ways. It has way more industrial uses than gold. More rare, etc... But the market cap is far lower. Why? Gold has more history being a store of value. BTC is the same way. Oldest and most secure with a sane monetary policy.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:59:11
To be fair, this sub mods evenly. Every time I try to slag BCH or mETH, it gets deleted. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:11:53
What is the transaction id? I will check it out in the "block chain."
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:39:22
Value is context-dependent.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:50:01
Why does he say Blockstream is preventing larger block sizes? Bitcoin is an OSS project with 1/3 of the contributors are from Blockstream. More devs are from Chaincode, so why no hate for them?
On top of that, the blocks are getting bigger. Are we supposed to entrust 80 Billion of value to a new small team of junior devs just because one parameter of Bitcoin is not what they want? Seems a bit rash. Why not fund testing for larger blocks in the existing Bitcoin ecosystem to get your parameter change in instead of trying to co-opt it? This is an OPEN SOURCE PROJECT - no company rules it. It is merit-based so get some merit by contributing constructively instead of trying to side-channel the whole project.
Roger is old-school an I respect him, but broski is not a dev. Broski is a wise money-guy. Being a dev myself, I can see why I am glad he is not calling the shots. His whole rant about "signatures have been removed with Segwit" made me lose all tech credibility with this guy. Even after he said Mt. Gox was liquid (which it obviously wasn't).  
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:05:25
Heck yes. This will make everyone happy. Even most of the BCH'ers. Let's do it.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:12:53
The last 17 of 20 blocks were full. Fee pressure still exists.

Once bitpain and Ver stop propping up the fork, bad things will happen, IMHO.

It is as much as gambling as buying some new company's penny stock that has a new-fangled tech.

Broski is a salesman. Salesmen say whatever they want (contradictions, lies, etc...) to get the sale. In fact, our society expects it. 
Hate the game a little more and the player a little less.

No. This happened to many folks. There should be no regret. Broski made a nice profit. The trade went as intended.

The only reason people value gold jewelry over, say copper, is precisely because it is more valuable. Gold is useful as jewelry because it is valuable not the other way around.

Just because ETH price tanks doesn't mean it is a failure. ETH was never designed to be a store of value. BTC was.
@_date: 2017-07-10 22:05:12
Hey - at least they tested it.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:48:35
I think because BTC is scaling. Also, a small percentage of miners is creating an alt-coin called "BCC" that all BTC owners will have a stake in as well.
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:36:03
Core has stated they will follow the majority. They aren't stupid.
