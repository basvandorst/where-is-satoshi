I'm taking notes and will bug my dev tomorrow, it makes total sense other than the free entry route which are a pain to digitize in the same way.

Heres the link : 
I may add this link to the terms itself.

Yeah apologies for that, I should have resolved this sooner. If you can get hold of that guy I will add it in though!

Your ticket is your receipt from Coingate, we put the transaction ID into the draw database. If multiple tickets are purchased we use the transaction ID with a +1,+2 format per extra entry. I'm looking into ways to make this verifiable at the draw. Everything is of course done via solicitor. We will also be researching provable fair methods as we move forwards.

I removed it as I need to review the information in there, those countries are not allowed to participate in online gambling, this fits another criteria for skill based gaming. I will post a link to the doc that clarifies each country in a moment.

I actually don't know how to do that, and the terms may need adjusting if the Gambling Commission knock on the door, as the terms state they may be changed. I only had to make very small modifications in the last raffle based on the discussion with the GC. I don't however foresee any radical changes in there.

Im not sure on all the state laws, this is classed as skill based gaming so please check that out. If in doubt free entries should be no issue at all.

Correct, the last raffle almost broke the local post office with the daily entries
