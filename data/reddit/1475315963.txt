Able to? That's incorrect.
"Chose not to" is a truer statement.
[Ghash.io successfully had 55% of hashing power in 2014]( and could have attempted a 51% attack if they wished to. Obviously it wouldn't be productive if your incentive is to make money off bitcoin, but if actors on the national scale wanted to destabilize bitcoin, it wouldn't be as difficult as you might think.

When you put money in the bank, you don't have a little box with that amount of physical cash there. You have numbers in a database somewhere. The medium that the bank uses is irrelevant, and if they wanted to use a cryptocoin rather than a database I don't see any issue with that.
You're missing the point of what I'm saying. Putting money in a bank that uses a crypto currency is not like buying btc/ltc/etc, it's more like a colored coin, where the bank has a layer of functionality that they are providing.

Oversight I suppose. You can't really fudge numbers on a blockchain, so auditing a bank would be pretty easy. Some think that it would stop fractional reserve banking, which would be huge. Cryptocurrencies are still so new that it would be interesting to see someone who actually understood banking and tech write a whitepaper on the theory of how it would be implemented.

If banks started utilizing coins, they're not going to rely on something as volatile as btc or other decentralized cryptos. They would likely use their own coin, tied to a fiat backing. The real reason to use a crypto for banking would be to make use of the public ledger functionality.

Because having your entire portfolio in a single coin, or really having your entire portfolio in cryptocurrencies, is idiotic. Banks have federal backing (FDIC) guarantees that mean your $250,000 isn't suddenly worthless because of such a volatile market as the current crypto market. Banks provide stability and a reliable way to store your liquid assets.

You'll either have colored coins or you'll input btc to your bank account, where it will become BankOfXcoin until you want to withdraw. Banks will never use standard btc when they could just as easily make their own coins and premine them
