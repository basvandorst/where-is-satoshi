No it’s still stupid mesh networking is a great idea but this is like saying you can do an offline email by writing it down and having your friend type into into an email and send it 
@_date: 2018-05-16 01:23:58
That’s stupid 
@_date: 2018-05-16 09:06:57
Think about it
@_date: 2018-05-16 01:24:18
Then you are routing your transaction through another actor

What is there was solar flair? Then all the storage would be wiped.  Whats the point of a shared ledger if it all equals 0. LOL

@_date: 2018-04-24 19:20:16
I’m just exaggerating why the fuck would I put myself in such a precarious position? Even faith has limits.
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:35:11
The first step here is to establish some sort of forum to publish content, and discuss what is already out there - any suggestions 
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:11:25
The first project will most likely be a LND wallet (keychain) we are looking for a good animation describing nodes and the transfer of btc between nodes :)
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:33:20
You are counted.  
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:06:13
Lol don’t post on reddit about it 
@_date: 2018-04-15 03:04:31
What quality are they in?
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:04:52
Anybody else notice that there is a lot more positivity on the thread then there was a couple days ago?
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:02:40
That’s fine excited to have you on board
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:32:17
Grow some balls 
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:12:47
Possibly... but maybe we can do better
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:11:56
Thank you for posting this So Cool!!!
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:36:38
How about an ionic plugin for BTC :)
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:04:14
I know js as well !== 
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:30:28
I’m ready to watch from sidelines lol - fuck the martyrs 
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:36:22
I want to test drive why is link invalid
@_date: 2018-04-17 07:22:31
Like meta mask?
@_date: 2018-04-15 01:45:02
So bulk would be $900,000?  Would you come down?
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:53:18
Anyways it’s really all about the design metaphors regardless of language 
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:35:07
It depends how you store your private key.  The public key itself doesn’t make you susceptible but it is of course one piece of the puzzle.  If you have a lot of funds in a wallet I personally would not make it available.  Instead I would just make a new wallet for that purpose specifically - why not? making a wallet is free! 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:30:16
If you have the tech chops I can help with dev/UI 
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:15:32
Great do you have work online we can see?
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:10:30
The kind of funny part is that the whole thing becomes slightly more risky once you post of reddit :) More points of connection fo a phishing scam. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:13:35
Time to start making some tutorials my friend. There is much steem to be made!!! - starting to love this brave new world.
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:56:26
Nvm not working 
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:53:59
The test drive link is broken 
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:51:28
Just started new subreddit r/CryptoDesign
@_date: 2018-04-14 05:00:53
Probably 
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:53:00
I was all about swift until I started messing with ionic and angular - it’s much more modular way to go
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:40:41

If you don’t know what AWS is - basically it’s the godsend of every startup because it allowed devs to run apps without worrying about running servers.  Almost every app you know and love runs on it.  If they can do it for servers they can do it for crypto.  However, eth actually has the capacity to be its own decentralized AWS.  I hope to one day see that but until then this take us lunar. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:46:07
Or invest in my crypto IoT project 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:31:02
Yeah 
@_date: 2018-04-17 03:03:30
Great welcome comment like to portfolio if you have one 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:25:51
Seems like a LND app would be pretty cool/timely project. :)
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:43:38
Buy this guys used rigs - 
Then find the cheapest electricity possible in Canada and several shipping crates.  
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:57:27
Great can you link portfolio?
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:55:28
Thank you. I will check it out. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:01:57
I would also be interested please pm with details
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:07:35
How personal was the personal computer before Apple? How worldwide was the web without the browser?
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:29:29
Lighting network 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:33:54
Ok dokey
@_date: 2018-04-24 02:58:05
Who needs currency when you have bitcoin. Lol
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:30:48
Cool work!!
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:29:27
No haters bro 
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:29:27
Very good do you have design chops - what skills do you offer?
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:33:22
I see one here for $600 used - 
I will buy two for $900
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:55:35
Seems to be working now 
@_date: 2018-04-17 06:22:51
I would like to propose a verbal prompt as the first act of this collective - describe the crypto wallet as succinctly as possible without using the words crypto or wallet.  
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:06:58
I think it’s because soros is interested
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:06:33
This is bigger than over $9000.  Developer tools are the key to wide adoption.
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:47:58
Feel free to comment with ideas, suggestions, problems  
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:09:29
I’m not looking for one designer I’m looking for a community of designers and users in order to inform a visual language for crypto - “portfolio level” or not you are very welcome to the project 
@_date: 2018-04-17 01:01:28
Awesome can you link work?
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:24:08
The most important thing about UI/UX design is that it is for the users and not for the designers - you are a welcome and highly valued part of this project!
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:00:19
Yes!!! this idea came from reading that Antonopoulos passage.  Also, great portfolio!!!
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:53:58
Why not take full advantage of the ease of creating wallets? 
@_date: 2018-04-17 04:30:20
Awesome will not you down as a resource for this sort of thing. Maybe you can start us off with a specific challenge you have encountered? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:12:38
Yeah also aws doesn’t just do shit without r and d.  There is definitely more to come.  
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:18:27
Lol it’s called poetic license 
@_date: 2018-04-28 21:21:14
Word thank you 
@_date: 2018-04-14 05:02:06
Still having trouble - “link is no longer valid”
@_date: 2018-04-16 04:48:53
Would I get a chance to see them before buying?
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:29:05
Great just message u
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:36:07
I’ve never seen that logical expression is that like !=
