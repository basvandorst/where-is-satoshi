Just Googled, Bitcoin Investment Trust ($GBTC). I belive these are the futures they are talking about :)

Got mine at about £300in slept better that night. Next day I installed cointracker and did not sleep since :)
Kind reminder to double and triple check the address when copied  in case you have a nasty one on your system. DO IT EVERY TIME! 
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:46:52
That would be great, but how does this work? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:21:12
I am :) at the moment I will start "loosing" if BTC goes below 5000
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:49:29
Dude, do not trust anything that is  published od Bitcoin.com

My moon is 1BTC
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:09:04
That would be good to know. I'm using HPFO but I'm sure I'm doing it wrong :) 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:19:14
cointracking.info (can import csv and have it open on my browser)
Blockfolio (I got fed up with it as it did not store the trades correctly) 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:15:03
Anyone has any ideas of how to make this work? I think about giving to a few family members.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:37:10
Expensive but relatively instant:
Buy at Coinbase by debit/credit card, transfer to GDAX (part of Coinbase), transfer to software /mobile/hardware wallet 
No fees, closer to market price but long transfer:
Debit/bank transfer to Revolut, change to EUR, send to Coinbase, transfer to GDAX (part of Coinbase), trade at GDAX,  transfer to software /mobile/hardware wallet
EDIT: added where to buy XD

What he said, plus you get to own some bits of Bitcoin!!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:22:58
Right? Even if it will drop the same as last time it will leave us just above $2000 threshold. I love bitcoin and here to hold, to be able to use after all this FUD will be gone. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:54:47
ELI5 this please? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:24:23
Almost dealt a soft hand this morning and after reading this I cheered me up. You are a majestic person!
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:58:02
Happened to me every time. 3600, 5800, 7500, 11150... That is my life. Not my fault I get paid when BTC is at ATH :) 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:23:17
Thanks, good to know I'm not average people :) 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:52:38
Great warning, I was about to send my BTC to get some alts. So what now, where do we go now? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:45:53
Plot Twist: someone has an account with those details... 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:37:03
Well if it is not then what is it... Better to down vote then explain? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:24:47
I would go as far as saying that she is already thinking about exit strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:37:45
That escalated real quick 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:56:12
Nothing? Maybe some of us realise that there is something behind the technology and want to have Bitcoin not for gains but to use it in the future? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:25:34
Where can you check this? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:47:22
I'm thinking of giving BTC during Xmass as well. Can you give ELI5 how you managed to pull this out. I get the paper wallet stuff but not the private key scratch card.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:37:53
In at 3500, 6500, 11150. Never looked back :) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:45:22
Some good news as well
"The National Crime Agency told Sky News: "The vast majority of cryptocurrency use is not criminal. Bitcoin is one of more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies and many people use cryptocurrencies to bank or to transfer money or make investments.
"We do see cybercriminals using cryptocurrencies as one of a range of ways in which criminals try to launder money.
"But criminals are mistaken if they believe that cryptocurrencies are untraceable and provide total anonymity."
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:01:34
You mean in couple of hours? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:12:29
1 BTC and above :) 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:00:41
You mean Pump and Dump
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:12:56
Get Authy instead. You can backup the 2FA accounts in one place in case you loose your phone. When you set up the 2FA write down the "code" that is next down to the QR code and keep it safe 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:04:03
THE upside down! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:22:46
Won't be broke because they will have Bitcoin. Will buy and sell stuff using Bitcoin only. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:51:08
Panic selling. GDAX crash people sell low in case GDAX closes. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:55:41
When you zoom out you can see that the last bubble burst took the price down 80%. Even if the price would go down the same way today it would still stay way above $1000
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:51:44
But I just bought at ATH. Have no more cash XD
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:46:40
Did not finish reading and my brain jumped into conclusion that you want to bring a girl to your own basement 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:09:07
I belive it should go like this
Then your Pin ie 3465, write down the first 4 seed words next to number 3, the 2nd lot of 4 seed words next to number 4 and so on. After you filled all pin 3465 lines add random words to remaining numbers
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:45:24
This^ best advise. Then you can't check the price every 35 seconds or so. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:42:14
Some already pointed out that it is an easy step for Ledger. I got one myself the other week. When you set it up first time and plug it into your PC it will ask which wallet you want to use (choose segwit)
Then move your BTC to the new segwit address but be aware of the fees and check the mempool so that you do not get a heart attack if the tx does not go through in 10 minutes but in 5 hours :)
If you are unsure just send a test amount first and rest when it clears.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:02:16
I think the main issue is buying "now" and not in 5 days when my SEPA funds will clear.
Buy now pay 5% fee. Wait 5 days 7% more expensive (my speculation) 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:44:51
Can I hold it on mobile wallet ie Mycelium? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:12:57
You can. It happened to me myself that Coinbase site "automatically" changed to BCH when switching between pages. Sometimes the BCH wallet would show up first rather then usual BTC.
I agree that it is your responsibility to quadruple check before pressing any buy buttons, but the error margin is high and Coinbase GUI ain't helping. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:03:25
Open up a GDAX account (part of Coinbase) and transfer your BTC there. Does not have fees on transfers. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:23:19
Are you trading BTC or just buying? Which bank gave you issues? I have bought some over the past month and apart from blocked transactions (had to call to unblock my card) I never had any issues. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:12:51
There is no sell, only buy. HODL
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:11:20
Please expand on the banking embargo? 
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:09:22
Get a GDAX account (part of Coinbase) no transfer fees
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:30:19
This is some deep wisdom!! 
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:45:00
That is understandable. The bizarre conversation I had when I had to unblock my d/card for coinbase payments. (Un) fortunately it is not regulated and even localbitcoins you can mention BTC at any moment when transferring funds to accounts
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:18:38
Dude just take it to any bank counter and if it is under £1000 they will change it for you without asking any questions 
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:40:51
While you will read some most helpful ideas of how to get into Bitcoin (u/kinoshitajona answer is best IMHO) I learned everything to start from both this forum and r/bitcoinbeginners. Just look at the resources attached to both forums. 
Location is very important. localbitcoins may be not helpful for a beginner cause prices for first time buyers can be elevated (price to pay for privacy?)
On the other hand fees for buying with credit/debit card are high as well :)
