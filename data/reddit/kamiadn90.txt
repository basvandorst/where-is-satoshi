The ATM operator might very consciously have chosen for 0-conf. Waiting for even a single confirmation could take up to 10 minutes (or even long on the off chance). Would you be willing to wait at an ATM all this time before it spits out your money?

You’re distinguishing only between Bitcoin and alts as a whole. However, altcoins are not one and the same thing. There are different kinds of alts (e.g. currencies, platforms, storage, exchange tokens) and alts of different quality (e.g. genuine vs scam).
In that sense, Bitcoin is not something different from other currency crypto’s that are supposed to transfer value peer to peer (e.g. Monero, Dash, Zcash, Nano), but rather it’s just the first and is benefiting from first mover advantage and network effects. Your points are valid for other currency alts just as well.
Also, other crypto projects offer features that Bitcoin doesn’t. Saying that Bitcoin is the only crypto that offers features that create value is far too simplistic and undervalues the whole scale of possibilities that distributed ledger technology (DLT) offers.
I really hope we can champion crypto as a whole, rather than focus on only the crypto’s in which we invested ourselves as being the only legitimate crypto’s, because what is the point of that? Spreading the word that only Bitcoin adds value from all the DLT projects around doesn’t help this/our space. Let’s work together here.
