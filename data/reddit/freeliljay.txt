have you seen bitcoin go down before?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:36:53
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:32:42
Not familiar with coinsquare. I used local bitcoins for my last buy at 17k, sent it to my wallet within 30 minutes, no issues there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:23:58
just sell then, rather not have people like you in the community
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:51:01
Alts are going down too, not sure what youre talking about. Ripple? I dont like it as a project. I wont ever buy it so I dont really care what it does.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:55:41
This new wave of people are just inexperienced, lots of people make the mistake of selling low buying high. We're going to have to deal with these people as long as bitcoin is becomming more mainstream.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:27:08
No, its just a normal occurance after huge growth
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:47:10
No, its just the right thing to do. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:09:28
going to sleep now, it will be crashed by the time I wake up
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:15:24
Actually, Im definetly not going to buy now. Its a high forsure. I am thinking about puting in an offer for 2900 and going to sleep though. 
It raised a little too fast imo, who knows what it will do next.

good luck my friend 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:08:58

@_date: 2017-09-15 12:14:19
It depends on what china does
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:13:54

@_date: 2017-09-15 09:55:59

@_date: 2017-09-15 15:51:59

@_date: 2017-05-17 18:16:11
Thats not what Im talking about.  No transaction coming from blockchain is ever going to confirm, and therefore my money is stuck within the blockchain wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:16:34
( there is no option to change the fee )
@_date: 2017-05-06 03:30:19
@_date: 2017-05-21 05:15:37
I know people are going to say, "its simple  rule dont use blockchain"  Well its too late for that and I cant change the past. I have already exported the funds into a new wallet. I just cant believe the transaction re-appeared and now its going to probably stay there forever? who knows?
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:54:40
There is no way for you to change the fee with Blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:13:46
what do you recommend I do with $150 permanently  stuck in blockchain wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:36:21
whats a uasf
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:31:03
transaction, and the fee you pay for it to send.
