They can't "print money to pay for everything". They can temporarily print more money to service the debt (at the cost of minimal, intentional inflation). But obviously, they need revenue to pay for expenditures.
The debt can grow forever as long as it grows proportional to GDP.

No, they sold houses in cash, not Bitcoin. They just facilitated transferring the buyer's bitcoin to cash for the transaction. The seller did not receive Bitcoin. Banks were still used.

@_date: 2019-03-28 15:12:42
They can print money which adds to the debt. But they need tax revenue because there is a limit to how much they can print. 
If they print too much money or don't collect enough tax revenue, the debt will grow to a point where they can't service it. Right now [the debt to GDP ratio is a manageable 104%]( which is inline with other stable, first world countries. As long as the debt grows at a similar pace to GDP, all is well .

Bitcoin doesn't scale to support Gen X and Gen Y.

* Bitcoin allows ~7 transactions per second so 31536000 * 7 = 220,752,000 transactions /year.
* Population of gen x and gen y - 137 million.
If all of gen x and gen y used bitcoin, they could each only do 1.6 transactions/year on chain.
