Cashing out three months into a massive bull market? Well, good luck!

Have you tried Robinhood or other similar services? You won't have access to the private keys of course, but for a reasonably small amount of holdings, it's probably okay.

There will be a large retracement between now and 20k, but the same people waiting on the sidelines for the dip will be too afraid to buy when it's crashing. And then we'll promptly recover and break into new all-time highs.

I always know the market is about to go parabolic when my old friends and co-workers begin asking me how to mine bitcoin on their home computers. Not quite there yet, but I feel like it's about to happen again.

Oh that's a bummer, I didn't know you were outside the US. If you can't get an exchange account, then my only other idea would be to open an online brokerage account and get some shares of GBTC. You may need to open it as a custodial account though? I've made custodial accounts for my kids. I'm not sure how it would work outside the US though. Good luck!

I thought Zuckerberg was a billionaire, so why does it look like his wife cuts his hair with a flowbee?

Well done... make sure you get a custodial account open for her so she can invest her tooth fairy or allowance money. I have my kids ready, and they're not going to miss out on this next big bitcoin run up to $100k.

I'd agree if we were talking about laminating the Mona Lisa or an original copy of the Declaration of Independence, but I'm pretty sure a simple piece of paper with a private key on it will hold up and any "damage" inflicted by the lamination process will be of zero consequence.

Yeah it's like saying TCP/IP could be supplanted by superior technology, just because it's possible. But it's not going to happen, at least for a long time because of the first mover advantage. Bitcoin may wind up like IPv4, where we'll just keep working around the protocol much in the same way that we have added network address translation to dramatically increase the utility of IP address space. And it still works fine, despite claims for years from naysayers that we're on the verge of running out of IP space. The fact is that decentralized digital currencies are the direction of the future. How people still can't see this coming is beyond me.

Why pay off your house with it? If we have another moonshot, I'd take some out and reinvest it elsewhere. Paying off a house with a low mortgage rate doesn't make sense.

Sage words, my friend. Even in wealthy nations like the US, the majority of adults live paycheck to paycheck because they lack the impulse control to delay their gratification. These are the kids who ate the marshmallow. And even if they do dip their toes into the world of investing, they become day traders in the false hope of turning a quick buck. And the fact is, if you're always chasing quick gains like that, you're going to get caught with your pants down about 99.99% of the time.
