I think rewards will be adjusted by markets to align with the value miners provide. There will always be miners to be a part of the ecosystem.
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:22:34
Miners always get reward from transactions. That's where your fee goes.

You have to travel to the future in order to know. NASA surely is working on that.

Where are you? Sounds like a scary place we should avoid. Wish you a good luck in 2018! Cheer up!

People know nothing and they don't care. It's an organized crime to me. Tired of this game. I highly suspect that they are the same group of people pumping BCH. Ripple provides solutions to corporations instead of coins. If you have profit you better realize it now and leave.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:08:33
I guess not that many people care now?

Do you think the followings are moral and legal?
Adidas vs Abibas
BMW vs BWM
Google vs Go0gle
They rip the idea and promote a counterfeit with very little tweaks. For god sake, they didn't even change the color and just shifted it symmetrically.
~= or &gt;1/2  efforts were spent on propagandas. Then use same machines to switch mining power.
It is technically *steal* rather than open source.
And then work with exchanges to apply such con to create futures to wash away the money from non-computer-science-field people.
It is very different from LTC or other Alts. They purposely hand made a hedge pair and they have enough fund to swing between them infinitely.

Those bcash promotors are really ugly.

That's my daily life
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:06:18
Maybe not. Crypto may not need diversity.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:28:04
Sounds like a plan and carried out perfectly!

The point is they go to mow fake lawns for $40. Why's why people pissed. Fake fabricated lawns are not lawns.

AI and BOT are taking over. End of story.

I was just trying to tell a joke. You are too serious and political. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:34:08
There is something called communism after these people...

Sometimes, the expected is just a delusion coz the mothafucking BitCH is damn manipulated!!!
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:05:16
Propaganda is the essence
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:01:50
Fuck those BitCH devils! The truth will prevail. Give it some time.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:58:38
I feel the same. It is scary when your computer caught virus which messes around with your clipboard. What your pasted is not what you copied.

Bch is on the rise again... Wtf
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:59:00
The big bro just went to take a dump. He will be back soon to pump his shit up again.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:03:14
This won't end soon. Those dudes have plenty of bullets to pump. I can lose all my fund to just fight for this ideology. I am short on bch. They have strong support around 1600usd.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:28:35
Why don't you go to LocalBitcoin.com and sell it there? Why are you here to sell it at a lower than market price? 想搞事情吗?

US Trump forces Chinese Yuan to increase in its value. And China mainland Chinese Yuan is so much inflated. In order to maintain the USD/CNY pair stability, China has to consume so much of their USD and issue more strict policy to the domestic citizens. I think China is going to take the advantage of BTC and compensate some USD loss. One interesting guess, North Korea may be involved in Crypto Coin world as well.
With more sanctions carried out to North Korea, I see little reason why Crypto Coin will worth less in a long run.
It will bounce a bit these days, but the trend is toward the good side.

LocalBitcoin aligns their price with the highest on the non-Chinese markets. There is little chance you do arbitrage on LocalBitcoin unless some Chinese seller wants to stop loss and you are lucky enough to see him.

Just checked
Onshore 20900cny ~= 3190usd
Offshore 3391usd
Why don't you transfer your coin to foreign exchange to sell and then withdraw usd if that is the currency you need.

It is the pressure from the superiors. Others will follow in certain ways.
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:12:51
I was trying to arbitrage but they fucking freeze my assets! Stay away from Chinese exchanges!
