You're welcome. We're hoping Bitcoin has a great year coming up and want to do anything we can to support it.
@_date: 2015-12-15 00:46:43
Glad to hear it! We'll get them out to you as soon as we can.

It is encrypted (passphrase protected) before we see it, or you can give us your own previously encrypted key. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:26:24
Absolute zero storage.
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:52:52
We never have visibility to your private key in an unencrypted form. Only once it is encrypted (passphrase protected) do we receive your private key for your order. We also do all of the manufacturing in-house. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 19:26:55
Yep! Just leave us a note in the note field when placing your order telling us to leave off the black squares, and we will.

Yeah we end up getting this comment a lot. But rest assured, we only accept previously encrypted private keys for orders (BIP0038 passphrase protected or any other encryption standard you may prefer). We also have a generator plugin on our site that uses bitaddress.org to generate a new BIP0038 protected wallet address &amp; key pair if you don't have the ability to encrypt the key yourself. We never have the ability to see your actual private key so no worries - this is the beauty and purpose of BIP0038!
We also check every order to make sure no one has inadvertently supplied us with an unencrypted key. It hasn't happened yet, but if it does the order is automatically cancelled and the customer is asked to supply a properly encrypted key. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:06:43
Yep, we sure can.

Hello again Reddit!
 
Last Sunday we set out for the east coast of Florida to collect a little saltwater from the saltiest ocean in the world, the Atlantic. If you didn't already know, saltwater is much more corrosive than fresh water since it has a greater electrical conductivity value due to the number of dissociated ions present in the salt.
 
As you can see in the video, we placed a Cryo Card prototype in a glass tupperware container with the collected saltwater. 
 
[Picture from our beach trip with time/date](
Now (May 21st) we can take a look at it after 10 days in room temperature (~75-80° F) saltwater
 
[Album of the Cryo Card prototype after 10 days](
 
So far the card it is performing as expected. The type of stainless steel used in Cryo Card’s construction is marine grade, meaning it has superior corrosion resistance to water, especially warm saltwater.
 
We will continue to post updates on Cryo Card's superior corrosion, heat, and scratch resistance on a weekly basis. If you missed it, be sure to check out our high temperature [propane torch test](

We want you to be your own bank! 
This is a major factor in why we decided to start this little venture. People shouldn't trust exchanges and other services to hold their coins for them. Obviously, cold storage is the best way to keep your coins secure and in your own possession. So, the most robust version of cold storage is the way to go. 
We use BIP 0038 private key encryption through bitaddress.org if you want to generate a new wallet (public address and private key pair) on our site. We have no visibility to your key before it is encrypted. The other option, if you don't trust us or bitaddress.org, is to supply your own previously encrypted key. It is a trustless system for key generation and ordering, as it should be!
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:06:35
Ordering 5 or more of any Cryo Card (duplicate or not) results in a 10% discount, 10 or more is 20%. 
Yep. Just leave us some words describing what you want in the note field when ordering. We will also work with customers to do custom designs. Please contact us via our site before you order if you would like a custom design. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:16:22
Also, to elaborate on the steel we are using a bit more, AMS 5524 is essentially Type 316 stainless which is a marine grade steel. It is the best corrosion resistant pure stainless steel out there. That being said, we will be doing a saltwater test soon and posting up the results. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 22:00:32
Well the main difference is durability. The stainless steel the cards are made out of has a melting point of around 2500°F (1370°C). Cards made out of aluminum have a much lower melting point (roughly half) than that and approach the temperatures where a house fire can become a concern. Plastic also has durability issues in regards to fire. Floods are no problem and scratches are also a non issue as we have taken a crowbar and scratched the card up pretty good and have no problem reading it.
We are also a real company and not out there to try and make a quick buck and then disappear into the night like a few of the other companies that have popped up.

Hey guys, 
We're here with an update to our last saltwater corrosion resistance post that showed what the Cryo Card prototype looked like after being immersed in the water for 10 days. 
Previous to that post, on May 11th, we set out for the east coast of Florida to collect a little saltwater from the saltiest ocean in the world, the Atlantic, in order to test Cryo Card's superior saltwater corrosion resistance.
[Picture from our beach trip with time/date](
We placed a Cryo Card prototype in a glass tupperware container with the collected saltwater. Here is a quick video of our trip if you missed it in the previous post:
Cryo Card has been in the saltwater container at room temperature (~75°F) for nearly 45 full days now and as you can see from the album, it is performing as it was designed. No rust, corrosion, or even light tea-staining is visible. Ah, the wonders of modern aerospace/marine-grade stainless steel. 
It is simply incredible for Cryo Card to be immersed in the world's saltiest ocean water for 45 days and still look like it did the day it was produced. But as expected, Cryo Card continues to prove its claim as the ultimate cold storage solution for all crypto-currencies. 
We will continue to post updates on Cryo Card's superior corrosion, heat, and scratch resistance on a routine basis. Our next corrosion resistance update will be at 60 days (2 months) of immersion in saltwater. And as always, please follow us at:

That can be done. I'll head over to the ocean tomorrow and grab some ocean water. It will be the Atlantic which I believe is the saltiest major ocean so it should be a good test. A hole is something we can look into. Thanks for the suggestion.
@_date: 2014-05-22 00:00:17
Ceramic-glass etched stainless steel vs. anodized aluminum construction. AMS 5524 stainless has a much higher melting point of 2500°F (1370°C) vs. aluminum's which is about 1200°F (650°C). So you have a much better chance of it surviving a house fire. Also, the etch/marking that we use on our cards is virtually scratch-proof. You would need to remove the steel underneath the marking to remove it. Aluminum is softer, with a Rockwell B hardness value of 60. AMS 5524 stainless steel (Cryo Card) is 79.
@_date: 2014-05-07 12:04:45
We only accept encrypted  (BIP38) private keys for our standard 2 sided card or anywhere a private key is used. 
The passphrase only card that you may be referring to is a cold storage option for those that may have a difficult to remember passphrase for their private key. They may wish to only put the passphrase in storage or they put it in a separate location from their private key.
Thank you for the feedback though. I will make these options clearer on the site.
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:13:51
To attach a marine key float to it, presumably. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 22:31:15
Ok, I'll try to record that tonight and post it.
@_date: 2014-05-22 00:03:45
It will be in our upcoming scratch test. Stay tuned. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:40:23
You actually wouldn't be able to sand it off. The marking is a ceramic-glass material that is chemically bonded (akin to welded) to the stainless steel underneath. It also somewhat etches the metal during the application process. It is easier to remove the metal than to remove the marking. In a sense then, you could sand it off by grinding the steel away where the mark is. 
We will be doing some scratch tests/demonstrations soon and posting so everyone can see how durable these are. In the meantime, check out the review and test done on Cryo Card by Crypto Coins News, which has some scratch and flame testing done:
And if you want to see what a propane torch at 3500°F will do to the card, check this out:
The card after the torch:
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:01:09
The key is BIP38 encrypted, so we never see your actual key. We only have visibility to it in its encrypted (passphrase protected) form. 
This also means that if someone were to take a picture of the side of your Cryo Card that has the key, they cannot steal your coins. With normal paper wallets this is possible since they do not (by default) use BIP38 encryption. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 22:04:05
Are there any tests you guys would be interested in seeing? We would like to have some fun with it (within reason). We'll probably do another fire test that's a little easier to see.
@_date: 2014-05-07 02:10:56
I was actually serious about getting some ocean water in case it came off as sarcastic, haha. We are located in Boca Raton, FL.
@_date: 2014-05-06 23:04:22
Found a video I took while camping when we put the card on the grill for fun.
@_date: 2014-05-07 03:40:42
We only accept previously encrypted (password protected) private keys for Cryo Card. You can also generate a brand new encrypted key and matching public address on our site. This method generates the encrypted key/address combo securely, on your own computer, and only you know the password to decrypt the key. 
Therefore it is impossible for us, or anyone else for that matter, to steal your coins unless they know your own password - even if you lose your card. 
We recommend you generate a random password that is as long and complex as possible and write it down somewhere. We also offer one-sided public address and password cards so that you can protect both of those vital bits of info as well. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:30:25
Cody from CryoBit here!
First of all, we only deal with previously encrypted (meaning passphrase protected) keys for our Cryo Card orders. That means that you can use any method you prefer to encrypt your private key before giving it to us for your order. Or, you have the ability to generate a new public address and encrypted key pair on our site through bitaddress.org (a highly respected and open source site for generating BIP 0038 encrypted keys). 
Further, we make every Cryo Card order in-house at our Boca Raton, FL (USA) location. No third party would ever have visibility to your encrypted keys, though this is obviously irrelevant. Since any key that we will accept for an order must be previously encrypted - and assuming your chosen passphrase is sufficiently complex - no third party would be able to decrypt the AES-256 encryption that BIP 0038 generated wallets use. Much like other card manufacturers, our order process is a trustless system, as it should be.
However, we think our cards are the toughest available today for cold storage. If you haven't already seen it, check out our propane torch test:
To get 20% off any 2-sided Cryo Card order use code "Reddit20"
Or, if you want to order 2 for redundancy, you can get half off the second card with code "BOGOHO" ;)

Cryo Card is constructed of AMS 5524 stainless steel. The average maximum sustained temperature of a house fire is somewhere around 1100-1200°F. Now, we haven't yet been able to find a house to burn down to test the performace of Cryo Card, but if you want to see what a propane torch at about 3500°F will do to the card, check this out:
The card after the torch:
There was some high temperature oxidation on the card after nearly melting it with the torch, but this is mostly due to the byproducts of the burning propane and it was easily removed with some naval jelly. A house fire would never reach a high enough temperature to even approach the beginning of the steel's melting point (~2500°F). Further, the ceramic-glass material that the marking is made of exceeds the oxidative and thermal properties of the steel.
TL;DR - we confidently state and fully guarantee that Cryo Card is fireproof (no fireproof safe box required).
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:22:44
Absolutely. We should have multisig and deterministic wallets as an option to order on our site soon, but for now you can leave a note with your order letting us know what you want and we'll make it happen.

We are still alive and kickin' and shipping cold storage solutions all over the world. We are just terrible at advertising. We actually launched a Black Cryo Card not too long that I don't believe we ever officially announced on here so we should probably do that. However, here is the link to it:
Also feel free to check out our original Cryo Card as well.

I understand it's a bit of a jump, but it requires us to do some additional custom work above and beyond. You can get the Silver Cryo Card for $30 + $10 for the custom work which will put you at $40 total. Some customers have used the Custom Work opportunity to put their initials on the card or some other type of branding to customize it. 
However if you just want to remove the CryoBit logo, I can offer you (and anyone else that's interested in the same deal) a $5 off code so your total for the silver card would be $35 and for the black it would be $45.
Here is the code: nologo5off
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:02:08
Great to hear it.....You should have the card within a week depending on which shipping option you choose. We are based in Florida so even the free shipping option (USPS First Class) should get to you fairly quickly since you are on the East Coast. 
We can definitely customize your card to remove the CryoBit from the top left. Just add that to the "Custom Work" section when you place your order.

Hey there. Yes we are still in business. You can message me on here or send an email to support 
@_date: 2016-10-27 16:38:37
Hey thanks for reaching out to us here. I just rechecked our email and didn't see anything, but I do apologize for the delay either way.
I'll assume you were the one that ordered a custom card on that day. The custom cards do take a little extra time to create a proof. We are actively working on it and will notify you via email as soon as it's ready. Thank you for your patience.
