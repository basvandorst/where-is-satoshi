Didn't buy in till I finally decided to research it and understand. The money is just a nice added bonus.

Why anyone would watch fox news for crypto is beyond me and why would anyone listen to what Jordan belfort says about crypto, he is a fucking scammer.

I will be canceling my coinbase account today and switching to Gemini and samurai wallet. Fuck coinbase and none segwit supporters.

I thought I heard it too. Someone definitely laugh at the end though.

I'm not aware of a time frame for certain features to be implemented. I'd rather bitcoin take along time and be done right instead of being pushed before it's ready and i'm sure as time goes on and bitcoin gets bigger more people will help with developing it.

For anyone who isn't aware. Bitcoin.com is a fake bitcoin site that is really for bitcoin cash. Bcash is an altcoin by roger ver. The real bitcoin website is bitcoin.org

All the different dates for the futures. I think one starts Dec 10th and the CME futures start on Dec 18th.

A lot of features are still being worked on. Bitcoin is still in early stages and NOT FINISHED implementing these features. Saying bitcoin is failing horribly in practice at it root benefits is like downloading star citizen and saying the game sucks because it doesn't do everything the developers have promised even though it's still in the alpha phase.

Ive had a trezor for almost 2 years now and never had a single problem with it.

Okay, maybe I missed something last time but ill retry it with newegg.

Just read up on the shift card and I'm very interested in this. I was reading on there site under how much it cost and saw this 
"There are no transaction fees on domestic transactions for a limited time"
Do you know what the limited time is and how much the transaction fees are after? Also what has been your experience with it so far?  
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:27:16
Does it add in a fee for the conversion to fiat? Is the card just linked to your coinbase?

I like using blockfolio to keep tract of my portfolio. And I keep some widgets to track to price. Other than that just coinbase and some wallets when I need them.

Last I checked they stopped accepting bitcoin and they option is just greyed out. I'm using the US site.
Edit: I remember know, they only accept bitcoin for none premier items. However almost all of there items are premier.

What has been your experience with gift? The reviews I found on reddit seemed mostly negative.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:49:16
That's a good point.

This is what I was thinking. I mean why sell off more at 6k when they could pump it back up high and then sell and make a bigger profit.

Thanks, I order off amazon a lot so I'll have to check this one out 
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:27:08
I would use Gemini but it has been almost 2 months and they still havent verified my i.d. I put in a support ticket about 2 weeks ago and still havent heard anything back.

Wouldn't adding more decimal places defeat the purpose of having a set supply of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:13:53
Litecoin and ether have the same flatline around the same time
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:34:03
Wow that a lot more places than I was expected. Thanks for the list.
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:16:49
Seems like it would make more sense on their part to have bitcoin go back up before selling again.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:31:36
I'm getting really sick of the high fee's argument. If bcash had the userbase bitcoin does then it's scaling issues would be noticed too. bcash solution to this problem is not sustainable in the log run and could even push the altcoin in a more centralized direction.

One thing that I think will need to happen is peoples attitude will need to change as far as accountability for their assets. Right now you can put your money in the bank and it is insured and someone else is at fault if something happens to your money. Using a bank however has a lot of draw backs as we all know so I think people will need to start learning how to take accountability and be responsible for there own assets. Obviously as this tech keeps growing this will become easier to do but people are going to have to adapted their thinking in order to be able to secure their future.
