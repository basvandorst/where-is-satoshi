I purchased small amounts thru coinbase and moved them quickly to my mobile wallet. Once I felt I had accumulated an amount that I felt was signifigant on my mobile I purchased a hardware wallet and moved most of it from my mobile to Hardware. I will continue that path. 
As for Coinbase I chose to not leave it in their wallet because I want my wallet seed and to not worry about the bank(coinbase) getting hacked. I am sure someone else will have a better explanation for not leaving your BTC with someone else.

Is there a reason that KeepKey isnt thrown into that mix? I have noticed that this sub tends to push Trezor or Ledger. Just curios if something is wrong with KK.

Lots of answers in the faq section.
Your pass phrase will access your wallet on any BIP39 or BIP44.
If your hardware fails you can restore on new BIP39/44 
Yes if some one obtains your pass phrase they control your coins.
You can use the Crome app, Electrum, and Multibit
When I got my KK I loaded .01BTC on it, I then wiped it clean, and restored via my pass phrase. The wallet and .01BTC was restored.

Wouldn't Chinese extended restrictions hold or push up the price by keeping coins out of the market. Doesn't this  create less supply during a period of time when demand seems to be increasing?

Kraken also.

~~iOS Trigger you can watch stock and currency including BTC~~
Edit: just realized that Trigger is just like yahoo finance in that it only shows prices during market hours not 24/7 that BTC is traded in.

Spend time understanding how you react to wants vs needs and then how to control your emotions. Paying down debt, saving, hodl'ing, etc will become easier.

If I remember correctly supply is not a hard cap. Just like the block size it was set by satoshi and both are changeable with consensus.
