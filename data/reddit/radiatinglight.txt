Are you asking for downvotes?

This is amazing. Incentive for the letting Network to always be balanced. Just like lightning at adds an incentive for running a node, so does negative fees for balancing out the network and forcing nobody to need to balance their coins on the blockchain

What makes you think that?

Sure, but how does that relate to gravity?
Gravity is when every molecule of a certain thing is drawn to a point. It's not specifically a pull or push AFAIK
@_date: 2019-07-09 14:49:02
Huh, what do you mean about gravity being a push vs pull?

Wow! Buying $100 of Bitcoin every two weeks for 2 years starting on 2017-02-01 would have turned $5,300 into $5,255 (-0.84%) (
not to mention opportunity cost

Wait until bitcoin is accepted everywhere in other countries, then travel there on loaned money, because withdraw millions of dollars (since be then bitcoin will be worth 100,000), go back, repay loans.

I'd pay $7400 for one of em

There's half as much volume as there was in December due to a multitude of variables, so mempool is clearing, and lower fee transactions are getting confirmed.
Just curious -- How much did you pay? the recommended fees on most wallets are usually orders of magnitude more than needed.

I HODL because I'm under 18 and would pay at my father's tax bracket when selling, which is way more than I'm. Willing to pay

Zero bitcoins.
You can't reasonably mine bitcoins on GPUs.
usually you'd mine alts. -- if you want to mine easily, you can try using nicehash (if you trust them after the hack)

The lowest transactions per block are currently 1sat/byte, but if you send that low then it'll probably take at least a few hours to confirm.
2sats/byte will confirm in the next hour for sure, anything over that is essentially a guaranteed confirmation in the next block or two.
personally, I'd go with 2 sat/byte, but since it's so low anyway, you can't go wrong if you decide to pick 3,4,or 5 sat/byte.

Will you get a lambo from it? nope.
But is it enough to get you invested in the technology as entertainment? absolutely!
3mBTC isn't a financial investment, but more of a pet project, but it's still fun to manage and observe.

Many people have asked me why bigger blocks are a bad idea, now I have one more thing to show them. :)

12 minutes is a lot better than the two to three days it takes Merchants to actually get their money from the credit card companies. Stores that accept Bitcoin don't wait for the transaction to confirm, they just wait for the transaction to be broadcast, and require a minimum fee level. (ex. This coffee costs 1mBTC, so send us 1mBTC with a fee of at least 10sat/byte and we'll give you the coffee.)
 this way the store can serve the customer nearly instantly, and because they have a minimum fee level, they know that the transaction will go through sometime soon.

It's still possible to enter in your own amount of BTC as a fee, which results in lower than 5sats.
I sent a transaction from electrum yesterday with 2sat/byte. but TBH the difference is only a few cents, so it's basically negligible anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:15:17
What if it doesn't? Where do the extra sats come from?
What if, for the first close transaction on LN, 1/1000th of a sat turns into one sat. Where does it come from?

Any idea why the mempool spiked to 40MB after being at 1-3MB this week?
@_date: 2018-04-15 08:48:36
Exactly a year
