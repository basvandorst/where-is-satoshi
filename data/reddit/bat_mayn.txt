Is this only for Capital One credit cards or are they freezing transactions through their banking and debit services too?

If you're actively trading and not buying when low, then you are not trading just holding.

Oh you think so huh? Is that why the market is completely flooded by scalpers? Miners aren't buying cards at these huge mark-ups, and there are basically no rules for resellers and scalping.
People are in for a world of hurt if they want crypto to 'crash' because they think it will lower GPU (scalper) prices. Not going to happen.

So why are you going off on current GPU prices?
If you're into gaming I'd advise anyone to wait until summer timeline anyway, because Nvidia will likely push news about Volta in summer as well as Asus/Acer et al will start pushing their 'holy grail' gaming monitors (2k/4k HDR G-Sync/FreeSync etc) around the same time - so there will be a market boom.

So you're just pretending to be a dense motherfucker? Got it. Thanks for your worthless, shitheel boomer wisdom.

I don't know. Ask the scalpers, the entire world stock isn't in the hands of miners it's in the hands of resellers scalping at absurd mark-ups over +50-100%.
What incentive do you believe they'll have to lower their scalp prices? I'm honestly dumbfounded everyone is blaming "miners" for GPU prices when a quick glance will show *anyone* that it's resellers fucking everything up.

NASA hasn't done anything in decades. They shit on this man and his company because they thought it would "illegitimize" NASA - implying NASA could be made a mockery of any more than it already has.
First time I've seen this and it's honestly really disgusting. This further cements my ongoing theory that for whatever reason, NASA is not an organization intent on space travel, exploration or colonization and in fact are just 'gatekeepers' to outright prevent it.

*Laugh out fucking loud.* Good luck with that one, you're going to be waiting until after Volta.

No. No it's not. Miners are not buying cards at $1,200, there is no foreseeable ROI.
