So that the 0.5BTC can't be stolen from the chip, since it's not there in the first place.
So that it's easier to mass produce the hardware without making a significant upfront investment in the loaded BTC.
Possibly predicated on the price of BTC going significantly up.

Interesting. You'll need a supporting bank in order to use BPAY, so which one did they switch to?

Did you get a better rate with Circle than with [Coinjar](

Brilliant work. Here's 50 bits @_date: 2015-01-28 00:30:23
Nice work.

Hey, if you (or someone else) put at least 1 BTC in it, I might take a stab at it. Did you just SHA-256 the phrase in lowercase (space delimited?) and use the bitaddress.org algorithm to convert it to a private/public key?
Also to clarify: you Googled 4,530 hits for the exact sentence or just for the words in any order? i.e. did you search for *"correct horse battery staple"* or for *correct horse battery staple*?

Apple has always modified the binaries supplied by developers before publishing on the store. In particular, the [executable segments are encrypted]( so e.g. doing a checksum on a submitted app and a published app would return different values.
In theory you could reverse engineer the encryption to figure out whether the binary had changed. I surmise some cracking tools already do this.

Hi there.

I'm working on setting up an exchange. More details in the coming weeks, or AMA. I hope to give the international exchanges a run for their money, I think an Australian operation can offer a lot of advantages.

Pre-generating keys would help with the incoming BTC, but how about the outgoing BTC i.e. withdrawals?

I'm currently working on an Australian Bitcoin Exchange, [some technical details here]( Hope to provide safe, fast and easy ways to convert BTC to AUD and back. Questions welcome!

Tip me too please.

Deep stuff.

The trick is "Walk into NAB" i.e. you make a physical cash deposit.

Nice, minimal site, and your rate looks pretty good. Too bad your competition bitinnovate.com seems to have closed down.
I once worked on a AUD/BTC exchange using node.js but thought it too risky to keep up security. Perhaps if you could enlighten us as to the security measures? e.g. how do you store passwords, where are your servers, do you keep offline bitcoins, that sort of thing.

I'd like to take a shot at optimising your code. If I can get a 2x speedup, can we split the prize? Just PM me with a link to it if you're interested, the code just needs to build cleanly on a UNIX box (Linux or OS X) with minimal dependencies.
I have moderate crypto experience and also spend a lot of my billable hours working on improving performance of server code. Some references: [odesk]( [linkedin](
P.S. I had a look at the [notespace]( code but it has a libccoin dependency, and the [Casascius]( one is in C# with multiple system dependencies. I didn't have the time to rework the algorithms into C/C++ but an optimisation task is nicely self-contained. It could even be … fun.

That sounds pretty reasonable. But what do you mean by "private network"? Are your servers VPS or shared or AWS instances? Or are they colo's at some datacenter?
