Why is this newsworthy then? 
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:42:55
Care to elaborate more? I'm still very confused 
@_date: 2015-06-02 22:38:53
Thank you! The first rational explanation I've got from this thread

No lightswitch raves

What happens then?
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:09:14
I have no idea what you just said.The most I know about Bitcoin comes from a few podcasts.
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:39:39
It makes it memorable!
@_date: 2014-06-24 06:37:19
Yeah I've been looking into it,  sounds fascinating

What with everyone making references to 20 in this thread then?
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:52:21
Did it used to be 20 million?
@_date: 2015-05-31 18:15:01
I'd love to know too...

"I'd lean towards engrossing as my adjective of choice".
That sounds like a sentence straight out of Infinite Jest. Excellent post, love it!

What causes fluctuations like these? I'm intrigued by bitcoin but not invested in it at all
@_date: 2016-03-14 17:25:28
Hah. Also I still wonder why I see comments like this on Reddit - YouTube region unblockers should be as commonplace as AdBlock
@_date: 2016-06-21 16:50:26
I didn't realise it was a metaphor and not just a reference to something that had happened 
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:44:24
Please 
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:48:29
Yeah, I'm just casually interested in Bitcoin - my only resource is this sub, so a picture of a rollercoaster means nothing to me
