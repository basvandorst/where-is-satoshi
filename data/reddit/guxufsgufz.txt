Stopped reading there. Your opinion is as irrelevant as it is misinformed :) You're clearly just mad America is a million times better than your shithole country.

That's the natural comeback for why black-populated areas are unintelligent. Again, why are you so mad that the facts don't agree with your feelings?

Here we go with the Russian conspiracies... Oh boy. Did Russia hold a gun to Hillary's head and make her so corrupt? Was it Russia's fault she didn't campaign in the midwest? Obviously, right?

They won't raise taxes on you nor put a gun to your head and force you to buy insurance like an even worse party did...

Stop taking my money and I'm totally game

I can guarentee it isn't. The only bad places to live are those overrun with blacks (like the south) or liberal states (like Cali)

Why are you so mad? Every time you pull the "durr crime and IQ are so low in religous states!", you know it's because of blacks right? You're probably buttblasted the facts hurt your feelings, snowflake!

I'm literally being forced to pay nearly 1k in premiums a month because we thought it would be a good idea to elect a soap-chewing ape for 8 years. I could get it much cheaper if I actually had an unironic choice for a pool of participants who weren't 300 pound landwhales.


This is so incredibly retarded. First I'm strong-armed into buying insurance against my will, then Obama gives them more money on top of that? How in the fuck can you guys even pretend like Republicans are the corporate shills?


Oh wow something that makes up like .0001% of the budget sure requires over 1/3 of my income!

How so? I'm being forced to pay into the system with a gun to my head. I don't recieve any benefits to speak of for paying into this shit. How am I taking your money? I just want to keep my own.


Oh wow if only there was another option... Like saving money for a rainy day? If I saved half I paid in tax I'd easily have enough to treat a round of cancer or two, and that's if I don't invest it... But yeah, big brother needs to make sure there's as little class mobility as possible so we can blame the free market for our troubles! And rightfully so!

Let's be real, I doubt someone like you is going to lose more money trading than you're saving with the changes

Maybe fix your shithole country instead of running away then. America didn't become great because the revolution started and everybody moved back to Europe...

Wow I wish I was this stupid. Life must truly be bliss for you.

Obama was a socialist and he was the one that bailed them out. In fact, bailing them out is the socialist thing to do... Try again pushing a shitty meme system that doesn't work.

Does there exist an action so reprehensible we won't try and pin it on the Russians? They're basically the Jews 2.0 at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:43:58
Yeah, when they fuck up and make a mistake you're expected to assist them just like you expect them to pay for your schooling and rampant obesity. Or do you only expect to receive, and never give?
