look. you are right. you fucked up. but you can't control the past. you can only control what decisions you make going forward. if you end your life you have absolutely no chance to correct your wrongs. no fucking chance. like i said before if you are really into this crypto stuff there are still a shit ton of opportunities to make money. don't give all your attention to BTC.

oneword: ALTS 
you may not make as much money as you would've if you bought BTC but you can still make some bank by doing some research and investing in alts that you believe are backed by awesome tech. don't be discouraged. this only the beginning for crypto. whatever you do, HODL.

I place my buy and sell orders based off of the individual chart patterns of the coins that i'm trading. like i'll put some sell orders below and above the ATH. i also never go all in so if the price does keep going up or keeps dropping i can sell or buy more.
