Have you tried the version from [2/19/12]( because I have 2 6950s that have similar issues that are only present with versions older than this one.

Said jackass didn't want to repost an article that had already been shared, but inform the community that the article was trending by linking to the main page. I could have posted a link, but I guess I just like to watch the world burn.

Like 600, or jumping from 600-650. Also which application are you using to mine, please include your settings. I'm getting about 650 with a 1125 mhz overclock with guiminer and flags -v -f 0 -w 256, which accornding to  is just a little below average, but that is because I'm to lazy to change programs. Don't expect the 825 form bitminter as that miner sucks, but does the job for a beginer.
