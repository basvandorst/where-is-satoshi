I spent years trading "state-issued" RuneScape GP :')
Glad to have decentralized Bitcoin now!

Thanks for the accurate answer! Appreciated.
Also, thank you to everyone else for your concerns. Earning a steady $6/hour at the moment.
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:02:19
It was pumped
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:52:08
Really nice website! Good job dudes
@_date: 2014-02-01 13:55:38
I'm sure I will. At the moment though, 6 hours in, the variance is pretty small.
@_date: 2014-02-01 12:33:18
What is TA?
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:18:27
I suppose I am experiencing some variance now. Averaging at $4.7/hour. Never gone negative/hour though.
@_date: 2014-02-01 13:05:32
Haha, easier said than done with my method ;)
@_date: 2014-02-01 12:34:55
Nice idea man, you should format it into a more aethestical look in a pdf or something
@_date: 2013-10-27 16:43:02
I found it!!!
@_date: 2013-10-27 16:58:10
Do you have any idea as to how many people look at the Yahoo trends? Will this help BTC gain any extra volume?
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:15:47
Ikr, my mind is boggled at the prospect of free deposits into Bitstamp.
Surely it is too good to be true.
Anyone sure about this?
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:10:51
Ahh the exact same situation as me!
I thought it was such an interesting graph and I would love to show some people it, however now I can't find it for the life of me!
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:25:11
I love you muchly. Thank you so much!
@_date: 2013-10-27 17:51:52
enZY is a happy bunny indeed.
EDIT: You can't see that they are directly buying BTC, but you can make a correlation between client downloads and BTC volumes.
@_date: 2013-12-22 13:38:07
If you can use it for transactions, then go for it!
@_date: 2013-10-27 19:21:30
Extremely useful. Thanks for the share buddy.
@_date: 2013-11-02 11:51:25
Following you on my personal account :)
@_date: 2013-10-27 17:51:23
That can only be a good sign :)
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:30:44
As with everything, I am certain that this plays a factor in it, however the libertarian factors cannot be discarded as they also play important contributing roles.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:08:25
Oh I see. Is there a way I can buy BTC itself with Skrill?
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:00:55
Anyone else thinking of that Kanye West New Slaves lyric?
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:47:28
Just invest an amount you can afford to lose
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:05:06
Thanks but no. These graphs show the WORTH of 1BTC in USD. What I am looking for is a COMPARISON between the worth of BTC and the worth of a USD.
*N.B. The caps aren't because I'm angry, just to make it clear. *
**P.S. I love you.**

Damn! SteamBits doesn't have Age of Empires 2 :(

PayPal sucks. They suck a lot.
