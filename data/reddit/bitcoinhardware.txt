Nice idea to keep it compatible with standard and populate interfaces.

Thanks, I'll be in touch.

I'll have a think about the best way to meld it into another already used device... Haha yeah Kickstarter is the way for this stuff.

Great ideas, thank you.

I was just thinking the wallet wouldnt have a camera, to detect the qr code the wallet would need more powerful CPU as well the camera, so increases build cost. If your phone has NFC it could be just as quick, if not quicker, but yeah the basic flow is the same just with radio transfer of the Tx rather than visual.

Credit card size is possible, however thickness may be an issue for all these features, especially restricting battery life.

I love these futuristic containers, I have a few ideas from scifi books I have read also.

Nice idea, but it would push the price way above the trezor price, unless it could be kickstarted in a massive initial order batch. Even ordering 1000 is not enough to get any volume discount on assembly :(

Nice idea, definitely one to include! Thanks for your suggestion.

Another question would be, how important is styling to you? Does it need to be super slick with brush aluminium finish? Or will a simple 3D printed case be enough for you guys?

So a simple usb connection over wifi/nfc (meaning lower unit cost) would be satisfactory for you? I envisage that quickly double signing transactions using your hardware wallet 'fob' might be a great feature to secure mobile wallets (not against physical theft, but digital).
You want it to connect to that to sign or update transactions?
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:18:19
Could you elaborate, do you mean in terms of how new addresses are generated per transaction etc?
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:19:14
I will look at this, thanks.
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:14:45
Thanks for these links. I will investigate thanks.

Qi charging is a great idea and definitely one to include.
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:13:56
This is a good idea. Thanks

Some good points, totally decentralized is a given for me. QR code display is not easy with screen size as you say.
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:22:24
Great idea, how about scanning a QR code with your phone, and tapping (NFC) with your wallet to sign the transaction. The phone could then create and display the signed transaction as a QR?

Sure, whilst the amount of units you can shift (and make in a batch) greatly effects the price, 120$ is a lot for some users, as you could get almost half of your first Bitcoin for that price.
I suppose it depends how much perceived value you get from the wallet.
Items like NFC and Wifi would considerably increase the cost, so perhaps a cheaper wallet with a smaller subset would be a good entry model?
