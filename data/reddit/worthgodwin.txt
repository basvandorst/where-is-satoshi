I've had this happen a couple of times before when I didn't provide enough of a transaction fee. It should either get picked up eventually, or expire and the funds will "return" to your wallet.

I hope things will be OK for your parents and the other pensioners who are the least prepared to handle this situation. I feel bad for people over there...

Well, it seems things are different there. Here I buy almost everything online because it's cheaper and there's usually a wider range of options.  It's getting to the point where it makes absolutely no sense to buy most things locally. 
I have Amazon Prime ($99 a year) which gives me free 3-5 day shipping out here to the island or free 2-day shipping anywhere on the mainland plus streaming of movies, TV shows, music, Kindle ebook rentals, etc. so postage isn't an issue.
Things like supplements are usually 2-3 times more expensive at a local store (whether locally owned or part of a chain) and even cheaper if you buy in bulk which isn't an option at all locally.  That led me to supplements online years ago, but I'm now finding similar price benefits for most other non-perishable grocery items. 
Ordering from Amazon with bitcoin via Gyft.com also gives me an additional discount, so I use that option sometimes but not always.
Anyway, my point was not that it was necessarily ideal for someone in Greece to order everything online, but it could be better than nothing depending on how things play out. And bitcoin *might* (didn't say definitely) help get around currency controls.  Hope that makes sense.

This is funny to me because I have an AdvCash Mastercard that I load with Bitcoin. Self-hating card.

In Greece that may be true, but about the only thing I *don't* buy off the Internet now is my food. Things like supplements that I used to get at the grocery/health food store I have bought exclusively online for years, and I'm buying other "grocery" items like shampoo, soap, etc. from Amazon, too. 
I can buy anything from Amazon with a gift card bought with bitcoin; I pay my web hosting fees with bitcoin, etc. Most of what I buy online is necessary, not "for fun."
So, while I agree with Antonopoulos' basic point, I do think that if the more tech-savvy Greek citizens could get their hands on bitcoin, it *could* potentially help them order important supplies from outside of the country... assuming shipping continues roughly normally, but that's a separate issue. 
Edit: Another potential use for it is to fund a card like the ones at Advcash.com - if the card is set up with an address outside of Greece, they could step around the capital controls that have been placed on Greek-based cards but which don't affect overseas cards. You can use a card like that anywhere that accepts MasterCard.

It doesn't work if you don't have a Facebook account. Or at least, you can't order one without posting to Facebook about it, so I assume it doesn't work.

It took me about a year of mentioning it before my dad started getting interested and asked me to help him get some. Now he brings it up almost every time we talk.

Curse you, here is your upvote. :)

I really liked Circle and just referred somebody to them two days ago... :/

Read the last paragraph in the ports section if you don't believe me:

By using an unblocked port, using the ISP's outgoing server, or complaining to the right person who can unblock the port. This is a common practice and has been for many years.  
@_date: 2015-09-01 03:02:49
Lots of ISPs block port 25.

I do the same thing with unique forwarders for everything and got one to a BTCJam address and another for a Bitpay address -- neither of which are related to accounts I've ever used beyond simply signing up for the services some time ago.
I'm not aware of any connection between those two services. Has there been an unreported data breach affecting multiple Bitcoin-related companies?

As I said, spam was probably a majority of it. 
But I've owned my own domain names and used email through those domains exclusively since somewhere around 1998 and ran into the issue periodically. (I said 15 years upthread but it was a couple years more). 
I used to have to deal with tech support over this issue periodically and sometimes got the distinct impression from support that they thought the very idea of a person owning their own domain name and using their own email service was suspicious and strange. (reminding me of the hassle I went through in the 80s when I got a phone line installed in high school for my BBS and had to argue with the person at the phone company to get it).  
Beyond that, there was a big incentive for ISPs to encourage people to use their branded email service - customer retention.  
People were more resistant to switching ISPs if they knew they'd lose their email address, and in many cases the actual emails themselves.  
I had a lot of clients over the years who resisted cancelling their old dialup accounts because it meant leaving their old provider and their email address. Also know some people who still cling to their old AOL email addresses for this reason and in some cases kept paying $20+ a month for it until they realized AOL would now let them keep their email address without paying.

They say spam, and that's probably a majority of it. But it's something they started doing years ago (I've been aware of the practice for about 15 years now) and I suspect it was partially started in an attempt to keep people using the ISP's email addresses.
Edit: clarified wording

Here's a non-technical explanation of mining that may help add to your understanding (I think for things like this multiple different explanations help make sense better than any single one).  
Hope it helps:
