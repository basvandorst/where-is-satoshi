Ha! Well, it's polite to use correct pronouns. And in Canada, it's The Law.

Bike Lock Guy does represent antifa, and antifa does represent the modern regressive anti-Western Islamophilic left. Your side is winning a *lot* of territory (all of Western Europe and Canada), but don't expect it to be without resistance. And don't expect the parts you haven't conquered to ignore it and roll over.

Some info is here:
Aaron Ringgenberg is someone specific who has been named as both Patreon and Antifa connected.

The intent of your side is even more obvious. Why are most of the "migrants" fighting-age young men? And why are most of the pictures of migrants in the media of women and children? You know and I know what's going on here. It's obvious to everyone.

Nice video (I've already seen it). Is it really a coincidence that this post followed mine by a few minutes?

You align yourself with groups that call everyone from the out-group Nazis and openly beat them in the street, set fires, and use violence to prevent people from speaking? And what do you expect?
This is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. And history will clearly record who started it and who finished it.

Legally, it's a "him." At least in Canada, and in Canada it's illegal to say "her."
I admire your willingness to be anti-PC and give a middle finger to the law though.
