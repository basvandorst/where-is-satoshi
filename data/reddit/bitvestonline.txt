We only allow transactions to occur with one of our associates, we do allow third party trades within our facilities at this moment, but there is a flat fee for that. We are looking to grow our brand. We are looking to help people with their digital currency needs all over the world, so setting up other digital currency centers is in our future business model.

That's  interesting because medicinal marijuana clinics have accounts at banks, but they fall under NPO's. I don't think marijuana  is illegal in Ca. if you have a medical marijuana licence.

I have tried to get into contact with CB, but I just keep getting what seems to be automated emails from an individual named Jaoquin. How would I go about proving the transaction? If you could please get back to me I would appreciate it. Also, why is there not a customer service phone number I can call?
@_date: 2015-03-14 14:08:48
Wire transfer is completely different process than cashing a check, or even depositing into an account. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:38:34
There is a note or memo line in every transaction you can do. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 05:43:22
They closed my account as well...
Thread: 
 
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:21:17
That's what it looks like to me...
@_date: 2015-03-14 03:30:50
Good point, but how can my account get closed? That means anyone who wants to send bitcoin can put anything incriminating and I have no control over that.
@_date: 2015-03-14 02:44:41
Update: coinbaseadrian is pming me, well see what he says, I'd rather have it out in the open forum for everyone to see
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:38:07
yeah, but even "for drugs" could mean prescription drugs as well. In my case though it says marijuana.
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:36:46
yes they have yet to respond. It seems that they are just sending automated emails. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:42:44
Know your customer?, I'm not a business it was a personal transaction. I could cash a personal check at a bank, no matter what the memo line said. That's what this was 
@_date: 2015-03-14 03:26:54
Coinbase to Coinbase account, the other individuals  (the sender's) account is still active.
