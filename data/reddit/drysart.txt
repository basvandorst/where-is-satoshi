And let me guess, you don't believe that USD withdrawals being practically non-existent at Mt. Gox were a significant reason the graph went in the opposite direction over roughly the same period.
You can't trust the price on an exchange that doesn't allow you to withdraw from one end of a trade.

That's an asinine argument against regulation.  If people who *worked in the financial industry* who did due diligence on Madoff's investment scam couldn't figure out it was a ponzi scheme from the outside, what makes you think an average person, who has no detailed knowledge of how an investment vehicle is *supposed* to work, could do better?
Without regulations, what Madoff did wouldn't have even been illegal.  I can't comprehend how *anyone* would believe that's a better situation to be in.

How do you define what's considered financial fraud and what's considered normal losses without regulations?
Fraud also requires mens rea.  You can't *accidentally* commit fraud; but you *can* accidentally mismanage people's money in ways that should be criminal, considering you're very likely talking about people's entire livelihoods.

Great idea!
Let's let people lose their life savings to a scam artist because they didn't spend six years getting a major in finance to be able to tell the people who know what they're doing from the people who don't.  They'll learn their lesson -- they won't invest their now-nonexistent life savings with someone who sells them the same line of bullshit a second time!
While we're at it, let's let people lose control of their vehicles at highway speeds when a hydraulic line cracks because they haven't spent a few years in a trade school to learn how to be an automobile mechanic so they can understand when the scam artist who fixed their car didn't really know what he was talking about!   It's a boon for the medical industry!
And how about we let people's houses burn down because they didn't learn how to wire a house themselves and simply hired an "electrician" who knew how to throw out enough jargon to confuse them but didn't know enough to actually route the ground wire to an actual ground.  They might cry a little bit about losing all their personal possessions, but they'll know better for next time!  Tough love, right?  We let them hurt you so you'd get smarter (assuming you didn't die in the inferno)!
Brilliant social strategy!  Let the scam artists take all the money, while the people who were simply too dumb to learn everything potentially dangerous possible under the sun they might need to rely on someone else to do for them get taken advantage of in every way possible!

I lead design on investment systems at one of the country's largest broker-dealers; and I can tell you with certainty: the average investor would see nothing amiss with any of those things you listed.  Hell some of our 1099 reps are surprised by some of the surveillance we do for compliance purposes; and out of anyone *they* should know better.
It'd be incredibly easy for someone to explain any of those away to someone not well-versed in the industry.  Why do I need to take personal custody of your funds? Because thanks to **burdensome regulations** I can't move the funds with enough flexibility or agility to provide the types of returns I could otherwise!   Why do I return about the same year-over-year?  I use a layered hedging strategy across industries that minimizes exposure to local downturn, but also takes a cut of upsides -- it's a more conservative investment strategy but at least its reliable.  Hell, look at any annuity that has a GMWB option and you'll see they're offering pretty much the exact same thing!   (These types of bullshit answers, by the way, suckered in large numbers of bitcoiners into things like pirate's ponzi scheme.)
**That's** why regulations exist: to protect the vast, vast majority of people who haven't spent years learning finance from bullshit artists.

Andreas Antonopolis doesn't have the authority to put anyone in prison for intentionally stealing people's money, or to enforce compliance, or even the financial knowledge to know anything about how their inner operations *should* be working other than whatever dog and pony show they might have put up for him during his visit.  I have no reason to question his sincerity, but there are ample reasons to question his capability of giving any financial operation a bill of clean health.
And even if he had that capability, his word would just be an endorsement that Coinbase is healthy *today*, not that it will be tomorrow.  You mentioned that for the last six months it was clear you shouldn't trust MtGox with your money, but what about *seven* months ago?  There was obviously a day when MtGox was a legitimate, well-capitalized business; and then there was a day where it was not.  Do you think Andreas Antonopolis will be inside the walls of Coinbase should that day ever come for them?
Are regulations perfect?  No.  Do they **stop** scams and fraud?  No.  They provide a framework that keeps honest people honest, and to lay grounds for enforcement against the dishonest people as they're discovered.  They're just like any other law in that regard; but just because people may continue to kill other people doesn't mean we shouldn't have murder laws on the books.

Knight Capital Group would like a word with you.
And based on what I've seen throughout the financial industry, it's very surprising that sort of thing isn't happening a lot more often.  It's not a matter of *if* someone will lose nine figures or more in a software error again, it's a matter of *when*.
And I can also tell you from first-hand experience, smaller incidents (which happen regularly) only get reported to external stakeholders because regulations require it.  Some shady firms operating would love nothing more than to avoid getting some bad press about something they could have easily covered up.   MtGox, for example, was probably undercapitalized for the past two years and never disclosed it, and the most frightening part is that had the bottom not fallen out, they could have continued operating that way indefinitely under the same reserve principles that allow banks to function -- sure they didn't have *all* your money, but they had enough to cover what their user base might reasonably ask for at once.

A money multiplier exists for the same reason that deposits and loans add to the money supply: namely, money held in deposit at a bank can be loaned out to increase the money supply.
This 'multiplier' exists because money loaned out by one bank generally ends up in deposit at another bank, enabling that bank to loan out more money (a fraction of the deposit -- in other words, nobody is making new dollars appear out of thin air).  The culmulative effect of those loans becoming deposits to become loans again multiplies the increase in the money supply due to the expansion of the monetary base.   This *DOES NOT* mean a secondary bank is creating new dollars out of thin air, it merely refers to the increase in the money supply compounding on itself.
Take a look at the Wikipedia article for the money multiplier, it has a pretty easy to understand table showing how an increase of the monetary base by $100 eventually ends up becoming a nearly $500 increase in the money supply, all without any bank lending out more money than they actually have minus their reserve requirement.

In mathematics, that's called the "birthday problem".  It's why, despite the fact that there are 365 days on the calendar, you only need to get 23 people in a room before you have a 50% chance that two of them have the same birthday; and with 57 people you have a 99% chance.
However, the numbers we're actually talking about with Bitcoin are so astronomically huge that you'd need to generate [1.4 * 10^24]( addresses to have a 50% chance of *any two* of them being the same.

At no point did the bank loan out money they did not have, which is what SlickTheNick implied commercial banks and credit unions do by stating that a bank couldn't operate the same way with bitcoin because they couldn't lend out money they don't have.
Dollar-based commercial banks *do not lend money they don't have*.  They don't simply create new dollars to loan out.  They loan out, say, 80% of their deposits, *not 900%*.

No, he released his 2010 returns.  He didn't release any returns before that, most importantly his 2009 returns, which would expose whether or not he took advantage of the IRS tax amnesty program (a one-time offer by the IRS to allow someone to admit they were illegally offshoring money to avoid paying taxes without criminal penalty).  Returns from earlier years could also expose whether or not he was functioning as CEO of Bain Capital during a period of time when Bain did some pretty nasty things; a period of time that he claims he wasn't acting as CEO for.
The extortion was centered around those; since the discovery that he was an illegal tax dodger or that he very explicitly lied about his history would be a pretty severe torpedo to his political career.

I write financial software that handles transactions on a portfolio of billions of dollars in assets under management, I don't need a 10 minute YouTube refresher on how money works, I know it quite well already, thank you.
What you're doing is talking about an increase in the *money supply*, whereas the parent post was talking about an increase in the *monetary base*.
Banks definitely increase the money supply, like you pointed out. But they do not loan out more than they have, as the parent incorrectly stated they do.   If a bank has $100 in deposits and the reserve requirement is 10%, it *can not* loan out more than $90.
But if $50 of that $90 ends up back in the bank account, that adds to the reserve and becomes another $45 that can be loaned out.  That's perfectly fine (that is, after all, how the economy works in general -- the value of assets and liabilities treated as money without actually having dollar bills on hand), *and* is also possible to do with bitcoins in a bitcoin bank, which is contrary to what the parent was stating due to his mistaken belief that real banks just create new dollars out of thin air to loan out ('9x more ... than they actually have' as the parent put it).  
Nothing about bitcoin prevents fractional reserve banking from operating, which is a direct contradiction to what the parent post declared due to the parent poster's mistaken belief that a bank with $100 in deposits can turn around and then make $900 worth of loans.  To do so would require a commercial bank be able to increase the *monetary base*, not the *money supply*; which they're as unable to do with dollars as they would be with bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-12-07 18:49:15
That is an absolutely wrong statement about banks and credit unions.  They **can not** loan out more than they have.
The system is called "fractional reserve" banking because banks are required to keep a fraction of their deposits in reserve as cash as a buffer for day-to-day withdrawls from depository accounts.   *Not*, as some people mistakenly believe, because they only have a fraction of the money they loan out.
Think about it logically -- banking is an institution that goes back a long, long time.  How could a bank possibly loan out more money than it has in, say, the 1940s, before credit cards or electronic ledgers and money was moved around primarily as physical bills.  If someone deposited $10, where would the bank get the extra physical cash to lend out more than they received?   Banking today is basically the same business as it was back then, it's just more efficient now because it doesn't always involve moving little slips of paper around.
This is also why interest rates on loans is higher than interest rates on savings -- it *has* to be. If the bank was able to loan out your money multiple times simultaneously, the opposite would be the case.
@_date: 2012-08-20 22:09:06
Put it this way:
If a method of generating a given hash in a realistic timeframe were to be discovered or made possible, or if the chance of an accidental collision was anywhere near worth wasting time considering, you'd have **much larger** things to worry about than your BTC wallet.

The 135 isn't loaned out all at once; and it doesn't come due all at once.  It's loaned out as money passes through the bank, and paid back in small pieces as the money passes through the bank from the other direction.  The bank *never loans out more than it has on hand*.
Currency is liquid -- that's the whole point of having currency in the first place; so it makes little sense to sum up the bank's ledger and compare it to total currency in circulation, since the ledger fills over time and total currency in circulation is only a snapshot at any given point in time.
@_date: 2012-05-29 14:59:04


You should re-read the article you linked to, because that's not how fractional reserve banking works.   A bank can only lend out what it has in deposits, and must keep a certain percent of those deposits as a buffer against withdrawls.  Your confusion probably comes from a fact that the article points out in bold: **because a loan counts as money, the total monetary supply increases** -- but note that it says "monetary *supply*", not "monetary *base*".  Supply (access to money) is increased via greater liquidity (because more money is out there in active circulation to be used), but the base (total amount of money in existence) doesn't change, because the bank isn't making new money out of thin air -- it's merely ensuring that money remains in circulation via loans made using deposits.
The *only* entity that can create money out of thin air is the Fed.  Other banks can only lend out as much as they have or as much as they can borrow.

I'm not sure someone who believes the FDIC *prints brand new dollars* to cover payouts is someone who should be chastising people for not understanding how money works.
The "I" in FDIC stands for Insurance.  Member banks pay premiums into it, and losses are covered from those premiums, just like regular insurance.  Even in the recent years where banks have been failing in greater numbers than ever before, not a single new dollar was created to cover the losses.
The reason for this is that when a bank fails, it's almost never because the institution is completely bankrupt, it's just no longer financially solvent.  Solvency issues can be rectified with additional capital, which is why successful banks end up swallowing the corpses of failed banks -- they have the liquidity to handle the liabilities of the acquisition, and in return, they get the assets.  (In severe cases, the FDIC may use its receivership powers to divide the failed bank into pieces so that each piece's liabilities are small enough for an acquirer to take on.)
While it's true that the FDIC is viewed as being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government (even though it's not actually so), and so it is *possible* that, should things get bad enough, dollars *can* be printed because it's not likely the government would simply let it fail; but if things ever get that bad, good luck enacting your bitcoin backup plan while society is collapsing around you and neither network nor electricity can be taken for granted, both of which must be readily available and ubiquitous for the bitcoin network to be functional.

I have no idea what you're saying, but no... as far as a bank is concerned there's one type of loan: they give you money, and you pay it back over an agreed-upon schedule.  Whether you pay them back via profits from business, or whether you pay them back by selling your assets, it doesn't matter.  The transaction is the same from the bank's perspective.
The interest rate the bank charges is largely dependent on how risky the bank feels it is to loan money to you.  If the best you can get is a 15% APR, then you need to go out and improve your creditworthiness.
If you were to, say, cap interest rates at some more 'reasonable' percentage, all it'd do is force banks to loan out less, because their requirements would be that much more strict.

The lawyers will likely still have the same opinion, because dealing with bitcoin explicitly through a layer of indirection is still dealing with bitcoin.

They're not.  Your eligibility to get a loan is based on the bank's belief that you'll be able to pay the loan back.   Similarly, whether a bank get deposits in the first place is based on the same factor -- whether people trust the bank enough to trust them with their money in deposits.  That's where depository insurance plans like the FDIC come in.
@_date: 2012-12-11 19:20:52
You've always had to provide documentory evidence of eligibility for a loan. There's an old joke to that effect: "In order to get a loan, you first have to prove to the bank that you don't need it".
The belief part comes in that the bank has to make a judgement call based on your *current* financial situation as to whether you'll continue to be solvent enough to pay off the loan as it matures into the *future*.

No they don't.  Deposits become cash assets for the bank, which they loan out from.  Total loans can never exceed a certain specified percentage (sub-100%) of total deposits.
The fact that a deposit came from a previous loan payout is rather immaterial -- a dollar deposited is a dollar deposited, no matter what that dollar's history was or what the financial liabilities or actual net worth of its previous bearer are.  It's cash, it moved, end of story.
I'll state again to be perfectly clear: a commercial bank could operate *exactly the same way* with bitcoins which should make it completely indisputable that a bank isn't just simply fabricating more monetary base (coins or dollars) out of thin air to loan out.
@_date: 2012-12-08 07:58:01
The important point you're missing is that money is constantly moving around, and not all debts come fully due at the same time.
People take out loans with the expectation of future income paying off not only the principal, but some amount of interest as well.  The fundamental ability of doing so doesn't disappear when the total amount of debt exceeds the available currency -- which is a good thing because that's been the state of affairs for the world economy for a long, long time; and even in a hypothetical future bitcoin economy, it'd continue to be the case, since it's rather a fundamental property of banking.
What really rattles the whole system is when money *stops* moving around it becomes a "liquidity crisis", like what happened during both the Great Depression and to a lesser extent in 2008.   When that happens, people start holding onto money rather than keeping it moving, which basically means people don't get the income they were relying upon to pay off their loans, which means they can't pay off their debts, which in turns means those creditors start having trouble paying off *their* debts, and as this is all going on, the uncertainty leads banks to stop *loaning* new money out and to start calling in their loans early which further saps liquidity, and the whole mess just snowballs into a giant, systemic problem.
The problem is amplified by a fixed monetary base, which was one of the key causes of the Great Depression -- the U.S. was on the gold standard, and so there was no way for new liquidity to be injected into the system to stabilize the economy when the snowball started rolling.  When the great engine of the economy seized up, nobody had the necessary power to get it moving again.

You (and other Bitcoin faithful) say it's "likely" for a major service to start accepting Bitcoins, but nobody can give a reason *why* a major service would do so.
In fact there are plenty of reasons to the contrary why major services would stay the hell away from Bitcoins.  
First, and foremost is that Bitcoin has a *terrible* reputation.  Major exchanges are hacked with alarming regularity.  The largest wallet site disappeared without a trace one day and nobody could do a thing about it until the owner came back and revealed everyone lost half their deposit.  The most public voice for Bitcoin was revealed to be a deadbeat, a scammer, and very possibly a pedophile.   The most known use of the currency is on Silk Road, for trafficking in illegal drugs.
Second is that Bitcoin is of questionable legality.  The US Constitution gives the Federal government the sole right to maintain currency.  Bitcoins are created and moved in a decentralized manner, meaning they could never shut them down, but companies are very centralized entities who the government *can* target.  It's an enormous legal risk for them to accept a currency that could very well be ruled illegal to trade in.
Third is that Bitcoins are downright hostile for services to accept in payment.  Transactions have no guaranteed clearing window.  Maintaining the network requires a continual investment in electricity.  There's no accepted method of performing a transaction outside of the Bitcoin client, so it can't be integrated seamlessly into a website checkout process.  There's no trustworthy physical manifestation so using it at a brick-and-mortar store is all but impossible.  There are no reputable insurance underwriters covering Bitcoin holdings.  The major exchanges have severely restrictive withdrawl limits that are so low that they get in the way of *users*, and thus are completely non-starters for a business who'd need to move orders of magnitude more than that.
Why would any reputable company want to associate with that, and take those risks, to invest the resources necessary to accept and handle holdings in a completely different currency when the potential market for that currency is so small that even a single user liquidating their holdings can cause significant shifts in price?
The Bitcoin community needs to get *its own* house in order before expecting significant outsiders to embrace it.
@_date: 2011-09-08 16:15:04


The problem is that it *doesn't*.
First of all is that it's not "free".  Keep in mind, we're talking about your stated goal of causing a "dramatic rise in price as consumers buy bitcoins to use the service"; so we're not talking about a fly-by-night bitcointshirts.com operation.  We're talking about someone like Amazon.  And for a company of that size to start accepting Bitcoins, it would involve a non-trivial investment in IT to upgrade their systems to support the rather unique (i.e., hostile) payment model Bitcoin uses.
And ss I mentioned, the Bitcoin market is so small that *a single actor* can (and *has* several times in the past) cause a shift in the price.  There simply isn't the volume of customers there for it to be worth it for someone like Amazon to invest in making payments in Bitcoins possible.
And also, for your goal to work -- for it to draw consumers into buying Bitcoins -- it'd seem to require that Amazon then take the additional step of *no longer accepting USD*, because as long as they accept USD, "consumers" will just continue to use that because it's frankly unrealistic to believe consumers will download, install, and use confusing software; then trade currency through an exchange; just so they can buy things when they already have a perfectly good way of doing it already.


Meze Grill's acceptance of Bitcoins was never the focus of any article in any mainstream news source that I'm aware of except when it was mentioned in passing in an article about Bitcoin.  And there are two problems with this:  Newspapers and mainstream news sources have all pretty much moved past Bitcoin at this point so you're just simply not seeing the pieces about Bitcoin anymore, and Meze Grill only got the offhand mentions it got because it's unique in being pretty much the only place that accepts them.
Relying on uniqueness and novelty as a growth vehicle doesn't scale, because it works when there's one because it's easy to get a passing mention in the vanishing Bitcoin articles.  It doesn't work when there's five.


That's not how law works.  A court wouldn't just say "ok well Amazon, you multi-billion dollar company, you just didn't *know* it was illegal".
The man behind Liberty Dollars wasn't simply told to stop making them.  He was charged with and convicted of federal crimes.
That's an *enormous, earth-shattering* amount of risk for a company to take on; which is why they won't do it.  Even if it could bring in the "thousands of bitcoin holders" you mentioned (and it was a true market expansion for Amazon, i.e., those people wouldn't just pay in USD anyway); it's still not worth it to them.   A few thousand extra customers simply isn't worth the risk of being seen as intentionally engaging in illegal enterprise by the feds.

The IRS has provisions for alloting a taxable value to transactions performed in forms of payment other than USD (such as bartering).

They have infrastructure to accept payments in currencies which carry value in their own right; not to accept payments in currencies whose value fluctuates so much you need to use a moving average to value it.  Also, accepting payments via Bitcoin is entirely different than accepting payments via other methods, because *currently everything has to happen through the Bitcoin client*.   The integration effort to do otherwise wouldn't be trivial.
MtGox and others have tried to put together merchant solutions to simplify the process, which is the direction that would need to go; but unfortunately none of them seem to have the competence or trust capital for a large player to rely upon them.


Small organizations are different topic than your original goal of driving up the price of bitcoin via adoption by a service that would spur consumers to buy bitcoins.   To achieve that goal you need two things: something that people *want* to buy that you can only buy with Bitcoins (otherwise they'll just use USD since it's considerably easier for a "consumer" to use USD since *they already have it*), and enough volume to grow the market.


The client situation with Bitcoin is a major problem.  In that much, I agree with you.  But it's not the only one.   Even if Bitcoin were as easy to use as a credit card tomorrow, that alone wouldn't be enough to cause adoption.  It would merely stop being a drag *against* adoption.
Keep in mind, you're asking consumers to go through at least one extra step -- converting their current money to Bitcoin.  What added value Bitcoins provide to the consumer has to be worth that extra hassle to them.


No, it won't, at least not for any legitimate business (i.e., not Silk Road); because even with Bitcoin as an anonymous currency; business will by necessity *not* be anonymous, since all business require some form of supply chain logistics in place.  And if they're not anonymous, the IRS can find them and audit them, and just because something is paid for in some manner other than dollars doesn't make it tax-exempt.   Tax law has provisions for bartering which would certainly apply to any Bitcoin transactions.


None of this is unique to Bitcoins, nor is it impossible to do with USD; in fact it's possible to do all of it with USD *today*.  Your local coffee shop can get a Square reader and accept credit/debit card payments without needing to go through the hassle of getting a merchant account.  New smartphones with NFC can process credit/debit payments at larger vendors simply by swiping your phone in front of a reader.   Person-to-person payments can be handled by simply using Bump to automate the Paypal headaches; and not to mention Paypal could simply just invest the time in making their smartphone app less painful to use in the first place.
In other words, convenience is not going to be the vehicle that makes Bitcoin take off, because it has no advantages in that department that can't be done with USD just as easily.  (And in fact, once we step out of the fantasy world of what Bitcoin *could* be some day and step back to the reality of what we have today, Bitcoin is *inconvenient as hell* to use.)


No, my reasoning is that Bitcoin doesn't offer any advantage or value to the average consumer over USD; and won't enjoy any level of mainstream adoption until it does.
Remember, whenever you want someone to use Bitcoin, you are *forcing* them to go through at least one extra step.  Whatever you're offering them has to be worth their time; and *nothing* Bitcoin does today or in the forseeable future does so.

No it doesn't.
The concept of bills and coins as legal tender being required to be accepted as a method of payment only applies to *financial debts* that are *enumerated in USD*.
If you have a contract to barter with a commodity outstanding, and you fulfill your obligations of the contract, you are indeed entitled to require that the other party fulfill the contract via commodity as written, as the debt is not enumerated in USD, it's enumerated in commodity.
What you *can't* do is tell someone they're $20 in debt to you, then refuse reasonable payment made in cash, as in that case the debt is in dollars, and bills and coins are legal tender for debts in dollars.

No?  Then when you're describing is not at all what I'm stating is needed.
As I posted elsewhere, with SD's current design, your risk is limited to your current bet *only*.  If SD were to change to a deposit model, you'd either necessarily need to be trusting them with more of your coins for a longer length of time, or you'd need to deposit and withdraw for every bet and then you're right back at the original 'problem' of putting transactions into the blockchain.
And again, like I said elsewhere, having 'deposit' accounts opens SD up to an incredibly increased amount of risk compared to how they operate now.

There are other banks, and you can always withdraw your cash and use it however you like.  There's no human rights issue.  You do not have an inalienable right to banking.

It's using the blockchain *exactly* as it was intended, which is the problem.  The blockchain is supposed to record transactions between entities, and when you play on SatoshiDice there are potentially two transactions that take place: you pay them the bet, and they pay you your winnings.
The only alternative is for transactions to be done 'off the blockchain', such as by merely shuffling numbers around inside a processor's database; like what happens when you buy coins on MtGox and haven't yet withdrawn them -- your balance is just a share of coins sitting motionless (from the blockchain's perspective) in MtGox's wallet.
That's very antithetical to what bitcoin is supposed to provide over traditional currency, because transactions *are no longer verifiable*, at least, not until you 'cash out'.   And in the meantime, you hope that they *actually have* the coins they say they do and aren't over-leveraging themselves (and, to be bluntly honest, if they're not leveraged to some extent they're doing business wrong because there's profit potential in putting coins in motion rather than letting them sit idle in a wallet).  You also have to hope that your processor doesn't decide to exercise their First Amendment rights to restrict *your* First Amendment rights by dictating what you can and can't do with coins held in their system (much like Visa and Mastercard dictate what you can spend dollars on).
It upends the whole system from one based on total freedom and a trustworthy cryptographic trail to one based on mere trust.

Yes.  Why would anyone willingly spend a bitcoin on anything if they think the coin itself is going to be worth substantially more soon?  Look at how much the guy who spent 10,000 coins on a pizza lost.
Volatility of *any* kind, up or down, is bad for the stated purpose of bitcoin acting as a currency.  But it's good news for people who are solely in bitcoin for speculative purposes -- which are exactly the kinds of people you *don't* want, since they're the ones who cause a substantial crash by liquidating their positions.

Slowloris has nothing to do with "flooding packets", in fact the whole concept behind the attack is that it's extremely low bandwidth, so that someone on a limited connection (i.e., a home user) can impact a server on a very high bandwidth connection; something they'd never be able to do if it became a contest of who could handle the most data.

That's an incredible exaggeration.  It may only take a minute to modify the HTML, but that's such a small part of an integration effort it's not even worth talking about.   Integrating confirmation of the payments into the systems that actually grant a user whatever it is they paid for is the harder part.  You need to generate a transaction ID, store it, send it along to Coinbase, then either have a endpoint for them to post back to you, or poll them for status updates, then reassociate the transaction ID from the completed payment back to the originating user.  And all of it needs to be done securely.  And any business of non-trivial size will also want to integrate the activity into existing accounting and metrics reports, and also have separate verification processes to ensure Coinbase *actually pays them* everything they expect.
And if you're a large entity hitching yourself to a relatively small payment processor, like Coinbase, you're going to likely work out details with them *beyond* just filling out their online form; because neither party will be very happy if after everything's all ready to go and the change goes live, the payment processor goes down because they can't handle the unanticipated volume.
Now granted, you need to do all these steps no matter *which* payment processor you integrate with, so it's basically a fixed cost.  The question about return on investment is whether enough volume is done in bitcoins to pay for the time spent setting it all up.

That has absolutely nothing to do with transferring value from one blockchain to another.  Have you even read a single word I posted?

"We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone."   The only restriction to that is that you can't refuse service because someone's in a protected class -- i.e., on the basis of race, age, gender, etc.   A bank is well within their rights to refuse to do business with a gun dealer.
Funny though, Bitcoin supporters are usually all about the free market and free speech.  Why *shouldn't* BofA have the right to refuse service?

Banks aren't necessary for any of the three.  Isn't that what bitcoin is all about?

Did anyone honestly expect any different outcome?
If so, I might have an investment opportunity for you!

Mt. Gox using the DDOS or whatever other problems they're having as an excuse to not fulfill their contractual obligations is the *real* dick move.
It's not Coinbase's fault Mt. Gox doesn't know how to run their servers, so why should they have to suffer *real financial losses* without recourse because Mt. Gox's IT team is incompetent?

Especially when someone's stolen 500e from you and you want them to get it back for you, apparently.

But credit cards also centralize the risk and puts it in the hands of an entity that has the resources to create effective protections against it, which has the net effect of lowering overall loss rates; which seems to me to be a much better solution than simply assuming every random individual knows how to secure their PC (which, as this example shows, they *don't*).

Don't confuse circulating currency with bitcoin's market capitalization.  It's fairly evident that most people recently who've bought into bitcoin aren't doing it because they want to use them as currency, they're doing it as an investment vehicle or a hedge.  They're not 'circulating' it.

That fundamentally changes the nature of the service, as I said, because it means both that there's literally no proof that SatoshiDice would *actually have* the coins it says are yours (and as I said in the post above, it would *not* be in SatoshiDice's best business interest to actually have all deposited coins actually on hand); and it also means that SatoshiDice would have to take on the additional responsibility of securing a hot wallet tied to an accounting interface; and it also means that in the event of a site compromise or a legal takedown, *your* coins are at risk because they're in SatoshiDice's wallet.
You've literally taken a very simple and easy to secure concept and turned it into an enormous undertaking with significant liability exposure for the operator.


Nobody said they couldn't be, either; so it's not exactly "abusing" the blockchain to put transactions on it.


If I have to trust a third party with my money before I can use it, then there's literally no point in using bitcoin.


Does such a thing already exist?  Is it both cryptographically verifiable like the true blockchain and does it enable me access to my coins if the clearinghouse disappears suddenly?
The answer to all these questions is 'no'.
@_date: 2013-03-08 03:03:53
It's not a red herring.  If SD were to not rely on the blockchain, you'd either need to trust it with more of your coins for a longer period of time, or you'd be depositing and withdrawing for every play.
Under its current system, your exposure is limited to your current bet only.  It's **not** the same thing and don't pretend that it is.

The most apt description I've heard of the state of bitcoin mining is that it's basically a huge scale Prisoner's Dilemma simulator and everyone involved in mashing the "Betray" button as hard as they possibly can.
