Here's some history that explain's bitcoin's worldview: 
And here's a more current view of bitcoin early adopters: 
And here's a quote from Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin:
"Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years.
Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own."

But couldn't a business simply say they had no transactions, or vastly under-report them, since there is no need to deposit cash in a traceable bank account at the end of the day etc.?  Meaning, the problems you identify with cash are still essentially problems of traceable money which would, in theory, be dealt with by Bitcoin.
Then if the government says, "Well, we know you're making money, hand it over" the business says, "You can't make me" and "prove we have the money you say we do" which, of course, the government can't do.
I, personally, would love to see a [Diamond Age]( society emerge where all transactions are totally encrypted and governments cease to function.

Who owns the road and why would they just let people dump their trash there for free?  People would have to dump trash on their own property or pay somebody the true cost of dealing with it.  If they tried to secretly dump on someone else's property that person would have incentive to catch them (with video cameras, security guards etc.) and a repeat offender would be easy to catch.
This would also massively incentivize people to be less wasteful, recycle more, and would spur the development of less environmentally harmful products as people were forced to bear the full brunt of their costly habits, so a free market would actually be better for the environment as well.  The government subsidizing landfills is essentially the same as the government subsidizing a wasteful consumer culture built on planned obsolescence.
@_date: 2013-07-02 21:40:29


Well, unless they're caught and hauled before an arbitrator and made to pay fines.


Maybe.  Maybe they could turn it into a business.


Right, but given our current court system, this is a costly, long process with little guarantee of justice.  A market anarchy postulates a court system that is responsive to customers, speedy/efficient, and impartial in order to maintain reputation.  And I'm guessing the current private property dumping either a) happens infrequently enough not to matter or b) happens on the property of an "absentee" landlord, as it were, in which case there's not much of an issue (if the dumping is seeping toxic chemicals etc. the neighbors would have the legal standing to sue the landowner for not taking care of his property and allowing dumping of toxic chemicals, and he would then have an incentive to prevent such dumping in the future).


No, because you're also lowering taxes and regulatory burden for everyone by eliminating government and wasteful subsidies, and you're showing people the true cost of their actions.

But I think you're ignoring all the externalities that government brings here.  It's not just taxes.  It's poor infrastructure maintenance, police who can kill citizens with very little repercussions and routinely do, expensive wars (with mass deaths etc.) and stifling regulations that slow GDP growth and make people poorer etc.  Is that all worth paying a few less dollars to the trash company?


And I disagree, because if it was properly priced, as I mentioned in my first response, 
1) people would have more of an incentive to prevent dumping on their own land because disposing of it would be expensive for them, and,
2) on a macro, long term level (I grant you this may not be the case in the short term) there would be less trash generally as people adapted to the higher prices of dumping by recycling more, buying things that they could re-use, and developing products that didn't have to be thrown out as often (i.e. more environmentally friendly, only with a monetary incentive to do so).

@_date: 2013-08-14 21:35:01
I think most of the value from Bitcoin comes it being unregulated though.  If I want to get money out of a repressive regime (or if the US keeps printing dollars and hyperinflation occurs) reporting requirements and regulations on exchanges make that more difficult.  If I want to purchase something that my local government deems illegal (not just drugs in the US, but website hosting, for instance, in a place like Iran or NK), tracking BTC transactions makes that more difficult.
@_date: 2013-07-03 05:00:05


Well, but not really, because even just allowing one tax presupposes a lot of things, like a government willing and capable to collect it, an agency to enforce it, and a law to support it.  I should think, logically, all the other stuff follows from that.


In which case, again, people would re-use things more (glass milk bottles like the '50s) or develop products that didn't require being thrown away as much.


And I disagree, and I think given that we're both arguing couterfactuals here it's doubtful either of us will convince the other.
@_date: 2013-08-15 02:50:34
More the latter, this needs to be online and convenient or it won't work.  The fiat is (as always) the issue, but there are some potential solutions that make it so the Gvt doesn't have a central exchange to go after (some sort of crypto escrow protocol, or maybe something that takes advantage of anonymous pre-paid debit cards/gift cards or something).

Maybe, but if I make money off of my road that I own (directly through tolls, or indirectly through businesses who pay me to open roads to their locations etc.) it's in my best interest to keep them clean, open and un-dumped on.  I would even argue that a private road owner has MORE of an incentive to keep his road spick and span than a government agency does.


This can be solved by HOA-like covenants (don't dump toxic stuff on your own land or you'll be kicked out f the neighborhood etc.) or simply taking someone to court that was suspected of dumping hazardous materials that could threaten the ground water.  I still don't think it follows that I should have to pay taxes to dispose of someone else's trash.

I'm confused why that follows.  Won't a private land owner, incentivized to keep his road clean, be incentivized to stop and apprehend people who are dumping on it?  My point was that being incentivized to keep your road clean will mean you will prevent people from dumping on it.  Otherwise you're just doing a whole lot of work hauling their trash and not getting paid for it.


Ok, sure, but it's a voluntary association; which are perfectly fine in a market anarchy.


Not sure what you're saying here.  Is this a question about courts?


But if you're repeatedly dumping, it's not.  Remember, you need a long term trash solution.  Dumping your garbage one time, yeah, easy to not get caught.  Doing it time and again over the course of years, not so easy, especially when private property owners have an incentive to catch you and make you pay (with cameras, guards etc.).
