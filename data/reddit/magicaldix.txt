Well maybe some creditors with addresses in the EU can get some GDPR PENALTIES from Fortress!!!
creditor:   "CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW, FORTRESS?"   rofl
... with over a Billion dollars in annual revenue, the smaller "lower level" penalty of $10 million dollars or 2% whichever is greater, would equal $20 million dollars...   now would that be, per offense, per person? I smell bankruptcy in San Francisco on the 42nd floor of the Spear tower.
 Can each of the EU creditors PLEASE soak these sleezeballz and completely OWN their asses!?  
* On a personal note:  The fact that they stamped MtGox on there, and also in Japanese (in red no less) certainly would put me in a state of fear and paranoia, as if the whole fiasco of MtGox isn't enough already for those involved.  Hopefully, nobody pays attention to english or japanese in red, stamped on your mail, in Europe....

I know all about the backup words, he had forgotten his password before he died and we had talked about that.  If he had setup backup words, he probably would have used them...  i'll keep my eye out for them in the future!  Thanks for reminding me about that ;)

So you want to be a trader buying and selling?
I'm confused, unless you just want to cash out, or just want to buy more with your personal cash?
Seek out an ATM if you are near a city.
Or just spend it on your purchases when you want/can, and keep mining if you believe in it.
Never give up on your dreams, if I could tell my 14 year old self something, this is one message most needed.
Also, I buy coffee online (the website is  and see they take bitcoins, although I don't have any to spend (lost all in mtgox). In case you're a coffee drinker...   Also newegg.com I'm pretty sure accepts bitcoin.
Good luck and let us know how it goes!
