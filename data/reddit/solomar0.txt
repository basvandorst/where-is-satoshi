I love the rhetoric companies use when they fuck up
Notice that they blame the people exploiting the bug too, literally taking no responsibility and just distributing the losses to its customer base - what is this 2008?

Yes I have a rpi paper wallet maker and a trezor hardware wallet, between the two I not only have a Swiss bank account, I am a bank. I can issue currency and open unlimited separate accounts for me or for others, and I've never been happier.

Need to for an arbitrage cycle? Maybe USDT could work depending on support on exchanges.

No one ever asks about the intricacies of the visa payment network or how a bank wire works so I've stopped explaining. I redirect their questions back - is Bitcoin money? Is a debit card money? How so?
I just say you send Bitcoin from one wallet to another and addresses are like your routing and account number on checks. What makes it so cool? It's not controlled by any entity it's just a banking service that exists and works as long as there is an internet connection.
