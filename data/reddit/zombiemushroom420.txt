I think Dimond's pay increase is significant because it shows people that banks are making money off of their--the peoples'-- money.

But isn't that only true in the case of many independent miners? Right now it doesn't seem like the miners with power are dependent on mining to pay for food and rent.

In the long term I really hope Bitcoin stabalizes and becomes a viable currency. But I'm still going to try to enjoy the roller coaster while the fair is still in town.

Ah I see. Does Australia have a holiday similar to Black Friday?

Thank you!

Holy fuck, I laughed so hard at this. Thank you.

Oh, that makes sense. I'm sorry I misunderstood your comment: I was pretty stoned.
I have never heard that rumor. I kinda want it to be true though.

Well now's your chance!

Why is each transaction .0001 Bitcoin?

I'm not sure if you are making a joke or not, but I think that is was Newton meant by 'giants'.

Well that is very nice.
 No, they're quite different. Black Friday is when the corporate pigs lower prices on stuff in order to further instigate the comercialization of the holidays.
Its tons of fun! I might get a camera this year :D
