I had a rejected withdrawal to an ING account. Maybe just bad luck. Maybe somebody could confirm problems with ING?

I consider to donate as soon as he gets himself a Segwit address... =)
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:34:00
Why is this Bitcoin address with priv key 1 exisiting on my block explorer?
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:44:39
This lies in the eye of the beholder. I think it was a valid post.
As someone who principally is pro core, the amount of censorship in this sub is scandalous, and really makes me think, why it is necessary...

If more than 90% of the miners push Segwit2x, this will be Bitcoin.
The old / legacy / original chain would likely die off.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:58:23
Bitcoin is in a bubble right now. It will correct the one or the other day. And then after some time, there will be the next bubble.

I hope you know that an account's age does not mean anything on reddit. It is set up in one minute.

You may be right on this point or not. But it is not your's or your colleagues' task to decide that. Users decide with their up- or downvotes.
There is no notification that posts or comments are blocked or deleted on r/Bitcoin. Lots of users got banned for no real reason. I more and more understand why community got split.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:45:14
I actually more and more think Bitcoin will be the Betamax, Minidisc, Netscape of cryptocurrency.
Developers on both sides of the scaling debate are riding a dead horse. Bitcoin will likely never be suitable for mass adoption. LN, if successful, will need more capacity on the base layer.
Luckily there are other valid projects, actually trying to overcome Bitcoin's design issues.
@_date: 2017-08-21 06:42:08
One of my posts in this regard was deleted yesterday.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:00:10
Fees are too high due to full blocks, which ultimately slows down Bitcoin's adoption. I don't see this changing longterm.
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:30:28
It was very difficult for an average person to invest into Bitcoin back then. Thus, just a pointless website you linked.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:52:49
I am sure the small block overachievers have tons of wonderful reasons, why these high fees are necessary.
Blessedly, we are going to upgrade to both SegWit + a 2 MB block size limit soon.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:40:06
We would need wallets that support Segwit addresses then...
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:02:14
Thank you Moonstats!
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:45:10
My miner and bandwidth would not be able to handle it. And I live in a developed country.
@_date: 2019-01-29 13:36:51
Mycelium finally supports Segwit / Bech32 in the latest version.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:23:46
I tried my best; cannot help. 0.15-rc3 crashes at start. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:51:41
Adoption would be much higher, if exchanges and mobile wallets would finally support it.
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:33:14
This **could indeed become a problem** with current amounts of fees:
The median transaction size is ~230 bytes. For fast transactions, the minimum satoshis per byte are ~70, resulting in 16100 satoshis (0.000161 BTC) fee.
Nobody will be sending 1 satoshi for 10000 fees.
So divisibility is not the problem, fees are.

Heavy price swings are normal in this low liquidity market. HODLers stabilize the price with their trust, because they know that
* it is a disruptive technology
* the Bitcoin network works as intended
* there is technical innovation / development
Bitcoin is so much more than an investment vehicle.
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:57:25
I cannot find it in your app.
@_date: 2017-09-24 09:00:51
That may be wrong. 
My experience is that it depends on how many connecting peers you have. If you have a fast connection and lots of peers you process tons of traffic.
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:41:54
The increase in price was a lot flatter compared to previous bull runs.
Maybe it is not over yet. 
Time will tell.
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:50:59
Everybody can help that it stays like this by switching to SegWit. Unfortunately most wallets and exchanges do not support it yet.
@_date: 2017-10-08 18:17:12
You forgot to rotate it ;) 
Nice logo btw.

That is what i thought too.
@_date: 2017-09-30 04:50:03
Great new Segwit address format with strong error detection. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:52:36
Never had technical problems with Mycelium wallet.
However, I switched to Samourai because they did not implement Segwit.
@_date: 2017-10-08 10:58:31
Still waiting for more mobile wallets and exchanges to support Segwit. Only Ledger and Trezor have done their job to date.
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:43:16


**It is useless to accuse each others of blocking progress.** You are probably right, maybe not, future will tell. But with the current POW mechanism, miners' concerns need to be taken seriously.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:06:51
BIP148 is malicious. Still, it seems to bring us forward somehow.
There are 3 (major) possible outcomes now:
1. Segwit2x gets activated in time.
2. There is a chain split and UASF wins
3. There is a chain split and Bimains chain wins
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:38:29
Thanks for the insights Mr. Maxwell, really appreciate it.
While I am able to comprehend and support most of the stated points, I definitely do not agree on one of them:


This is only correct in the technical sense. The network performs as intended, and there are no bugs, crashes or lost coins. But congestion has become a serious issue and high transaction fees discourage users. It is like a postman saying that sending a mail via postal service works well - indeed, it usually does; nevertheless email has widely replaced it by being cheaper, faster, and more convenient to use.
Bitcoin has to overcome its state of shock and move forward. Market share has dramatically dropped in the last few weeks. Maybe a chain split is not the worst outcome mid- and longterm.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:04:37
I cannot hear **"BarryCoin"** anymore. There is no BarryCoin. Just **Bitcoin with Segwit + 2MB block** size.
Your points are not valid.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:04:14


You got the problem.


It is not the miners alone. Both sides are blocking each others for certain reasons. That is the main problem. Things are not always black and white.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:27:55


This cannot be overstated! 
If you support UASF, you need to run a client that enforces the rules, not just signalling.
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:11:33
 Your name says it all.

Bitcoin (non)scaling in a nutshell.
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:01:51


I was not referring to your particular post but to the overall situation. People are manipulated in both Bitcoin subs. There is nothing like evil miners or the vicious core developers. Just a bunch of people not willing to compromise.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:07:58
**"We support the agreement..." (Segwit2x) "...and we want to make it happen as soon as possible."**
**This is the main statement of the blog post.**
The rest is just in case of Segwit2x failing.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:55:11


Of course it is, no doubt. However, I think that this valuable space in the blockchain should also grow within technical limitations as much as possible, and definitely not be restricted artificially for whatever reason. 
As an observer I have this subjective (maybe a little bit exaggerated) impression of the current situation:
- You / majority of core devs oppose bigger blocks, prefer BIP141/148/149; oppose Segwit2x, mainly because of being personally offended by the execution process of the NY agreement. Intelligent people usually tend to be stubborn.
- Bitmain wants to stall any development that is harming ASICBOOST, wants bigger blocks, wants to gain more control. Bitmain's boss has some kind of personality disorder.
- Majority of miners are okay with bigger blocks and do not actively oppose Segwit.
- Community wants to get transactions completed quickly and with low fees, prefers Segwit, wants a stable reference client. Doesn't know, who to believe anymore.
So my questions would be:
- Will their be two different chains in 2 months?
- Is Segwit + a 2MB blocksize increase compromise really such an absurd proposal? My node would be able to handle it in terms of storage and network capacity.
- if you / devs believe in BIP148, why don't you merge it into the reference client?


I have actually read and enjoyed your last year's post, despite my account age suggesting something different.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:32:37


That is a matter of fact, but no argument.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:59:56
Totally agree with each and every point raised. 
Segwit2x is a reasonable compromise and the community should aim to get it activated as soon as possible.
@_date: 2017-06-10 05:58:52
What an emotional wild talk.
It is people with personality structures similar to his that navigated us in the current stalemate. On both sides actually.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:15:04
They are just saying that **they support Segwit2x**, and in case of its **failure would fork** off. 
So what is the problem? If consensus is impossible, let the better chain win...
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:04:51
 Comments like this do not help to get beyond the scaling drama!!!
In the current situation, both sides have to compromise. You want to activate Segwit, miners want bigger blocks. So get the required changes done!
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:50:36
SatoshiLabs has always been an enrichment for the Bitcoin ecosystem, thank you!
@_date: 2017-06-08 06:49:49
Both sides have gone completely psycho. This sub is not better than r/btc, just a contrary view on the topic. Both are manipulative as hell.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:20:33
Please, do not be so nitpicky. It was clear what he meant.
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:07:05
We have had a ton of time. Nothing has happened. Alts outrun Bitcoin since blocks are full.
Other coins like Monero are hard forking regularly without any issues. Stop believing that hard forking is a major problem, if miners and community want to.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:51:37


You (maybe intentionally) did not mention the condition for this: If Segwit2x has not gained enough support / consensus by the time of BIP148 activation (Aug 1st); as a reaction to the UASF. They are free to do so in my mind.
Back to the topic: I would also like to see an option for BIP148 enforcement in core.
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:01:45


@_date: 2017-06-08 06:43:21
If Segwit2x does not pass, there is a high probability of miners forking away. Do you really want a chain split?
