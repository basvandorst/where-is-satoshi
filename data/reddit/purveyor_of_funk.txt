Of course, I don't disagree with this nor does anybody else arguing for second layer transactions.


Yes, that was never in question. I'm not dismissing the importance of broadcasting all transactions to all nodes on the Bitcoin layer. That's crucial to the decentralization/distributed concensus  nature of Bitcoin. The question is about how to scale up the TPS to incredibly high levels. I contend, and so do others that we need second layer solutions for this. 
Perhaps the writer of the broadcast/unicast blog article could have mentioned that L1 and L2 are not meant to replace, but to compliment each other. Again, it's just a vague analogy. I agree with with your distinction of "transferring of bits" versus transfering "value ownership". But again, you can view that distinction through the lens of abstraction layers. Transmission of bits in the OSI model = L1, transmission of value ownership (Bitcoin) = L7.

There's a difference between introducing extraneous complexity in a system and building abstraction layers/separation of concerns with well defined interfaces that build on top of each other to surpass the limitations of the original technology.
How do you intend for Bitcoin to do sub-second microtransactions with a 10 minutes average block validation time? It's not even possible. You NEED other layers.

The analogy doesn't justify the strategy. It's only a conceptual aid to facilitate understanding. 
You're thinking too concretely. The analogy pertains to "broadcasting of data in a computer network". You can't efficiently broadcast all data to all computers in a global network wether it's the internet or Bitcoin. That's not complicated to understand.
If you don't agree with this than please explain to me how Bitcoin in it's current state will scale to handle the worlds population using it. How about machine to machine microtransactions?

It's dfifficult to quantify it specifically. If 90% of transactions on L1 are Segwit and despite all atempts Lightning fails from a security and adoption standpoint, i.e. it's relinquished to just computer geeks toying around with it after a long stretch of time, then the strategy will have failed. Otherwise, if it's increasingly easy to use, adopted by merchants and users and there's momentum in all aspects, it's a success.
If Lightning fails or Sidechains fail, or what have you, then Bitcoin will truely only become a store of value and a sub-par (with respect to other cryptocurrencies) medium of exchange, not an "internet of money" which is the more ambitious vision. 
In regards to the TCP/IP quote, that's referring to TCP/IP itself. The physical/datalink (Bitcoin global broadcast concensus L1 layer) and the TCP/IP layer (Lightning L2) analogy still stands

The fact that the 1MB block size limit will likely need to increase is generally accepted within the core developer community. It's HOW and WHEN the 1MB limit should be increased that is contentious. Segwit effectively doubles the number of transactions that can be included in a block, let's exhaust that optimization first. There are other optimizations, like batching large number of small transactions into a single transaction. If all big echanges did this it would reduce the the volume of transactions on the network and recorded in the blockchain. These are smart optimizations which don't bloat the blockchain.
In the words of Nick Szabo:

Ridiculous. Nobody "refuses to scale". It's HOW to scale. Segwit still hasn't fully been rolled out yet by Bitcoin exchanges. Segwit allows for an effective doubling of block sizes. We need to be good stewards of the blockchain. It's gold 2.0 afterall. It needs to be held to a level of excellence. Let's not be tempted by quick fixes without concern for the long term consequences. Core is being smart, not reckless.

Man the sense of entitlement, especially when money is on the line. You're not a customer. You're not paying for a commercial app. He, among others, layed the foundations for Bitcoin.  
You purchased an asset that is experimental in nature, deal with it. Patience is a virtue. Systems that are built hastily without proper concern for the long term will inevitably fail.

That's a very vague assumption. Prove it. A lot of the "whales" are not devs.
Most devs have less Bitcoin than that.  A lot of them are more focused on the tech than short term gains too. Andreas is a recent high profile example of someone who people assumed was wealthy but in fact was not. He was focused more on the tech and evangelism than gains.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:59:29
The intention is not to concretly map 1:1 both sytems. That wouldn't make sense.  It's only a vague analogy which illustrates the purpose of layering a protocol on top of another to allow for scaling up the number of nodes on a network. You couldn't scale an Ethernet network globally, as you know. You need a form of routing. The Lightning network are routed payment channels. It's not perfect but it's a pretty decent analogy in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:58:38
That's True. The point I'm trying to convey though is that Segwit enables an effective doubling of transactions in a block without increasing the block size parameter, so let's let the network participants catch up and use it. In the meantime, the Lightning Network should fuel the adoption rate. Let's let Segwit "settle in" first. Let's see how the mempool and fee rate metrics change over time as a result of Segwit and Lightning. Then (the WHEN) we'll be in a better position to evaluate hard forking and increasing the block size.
The problem is impatience and speculators fueling hysteria. Smart engineering takes time. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:21:27
Of course. I think most developers are pragmatic about it, not religious. They're engineers after all. There's always tradeoffs but if it makes sense at that point in time and there's more pros than cons then absolutely. 
I think the way this will play out is that the first layer (L1) will be the global, highly decentralized, concensus layer. This layer establishes Bitcoin as a kind of scarce, digital gold commodity that is sound from a monitary perspective and cannot be censored or ceased. It's the digital currency, not the payment network.  It can't handle being a payment network to everyone on the planet because all transactions would be broadcasted to every node on the network which is absurd. The upper layers, like Lightning (L2) will form the payment network on top of the first layer that everyone is eager to have. The internet is literally [built like this]( 
This [blog post]( which was posted on today explains this well.
Greg Maxwell does a brilliant job of explaining the reasoning behind the multi-layer concept in this [post](

Yes, it's a conceptual analogy not a direct comparison, as you state. Modern Ethernet LANs AKA broadcast domains don't actually broadcast to every host. Switches will only transmit to specific ports by parsing the Ethernet frame destination MAC addresses.

But then that would fall under his categorization of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. I think it's a poor analogy to describe it as a messaging app because it's really not. Bitcoin is not IRC or FB Messenger. The  level of abstraction required to make that mental comparison is too high.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:06:36
But in the context of an electronic cash system/digital currency, the "message" is better described as a transaction. You're transacting value from a sender to a recipient. Yes you sign a message when spending your UTXOs but that doesn't make it a "messaging app". There's a broader social understanding that a "messaging app" means an app that facilitates sending and receiving written text for communication between humans.

If I understand correctly, they don't payout in BTC? That means they payout in whatever currency you're mining at the moment in the multipool? How does that work? Does that mean I need a wallet for that weird new esoteric currency? And then myself exchange on cryptsy or whatever other cryptocurrency exchange?

The US federal government is not one monolithic institution. The different agencies, bureaus, departments, whatever, inside the federal government often act independently and don't always see eye to eye.

I invested 2 BTC into the site. I can see my balance of 2BTC + profit but when I go to withdraw it says "You can not withdraw 2 when your balance is 0". 
I logged out and then logged back in, same issue. Any ideas?

Andreas is by far the most prominent and eloquent Bitcoin advocate. If it weren't for him I likely would have kept dismissing Bitcoin. He has a much deeper understanding of Bitcoin then most. He's able to synthesize coherent thoughts about the vast socio-political, legal and technological implications that Bitcoin brings forth. He's not hacking at the Core code everyday but he's amazing at conveying technical information to others  - i've seen a youtube recording where he discusses transactions and transaction types to Devs in San Francisco. His upcoming book is going to help foster a healthy dev ecosystem in Bitcoin. That's a big contribution. I love when he shares his amazing insights into Bitcoin. He always captures my attention.

Oh, that blows, not that I'm aware of. Try every possible combination you can think of. That password basically decrypts your private keys so that you can sign transactions.

Two options as far as I'm aware:
1) Sign up to a Bitcoin exchange. [Quadrigacx]( is the most liquid for CAD
or 2) Sell locally with [localbitcoins.com](
