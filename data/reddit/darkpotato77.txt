Some mine because they believe in Bitcoin and want to see it succeed. It's not necessarily about maximizing gain in the short term.

This "Fiat Money" thing just seems really risky and unreliable.

It's not really a market if you can't buy or sell freely.

So like a Bitcoin ATM  but your personal info is recorded, you have to trust a third party to hold your money and it's all done using a shitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:46:18
lol, shill
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:16:36
And yet you created a shitcoin which you're trying to pump. No evidence of this "huge amount of users"
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:47:46
Did you know your shitcoin scam company's twitter account's been blocked by Andreas Antonopoulous because of your dishonest marketing?
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:45:14
Alright I get it. You're trying to shill your coin really hard because it's been going down precipitously. Listen to me, quit while you're ahead. It's not worth it.

The government controlling the currency is the cause of the business cycle in the first place.

Is this what your "great team" of 50+ has been able to accomplish? One commit???? lol 
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:58:03
Wow dude like don't you have a real product to be building
@_date: 2018-04-16 05:36:43
Soo... It's like localbitcoins with a shitcoin attached to it
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:34:10
Do you have a single fact to back that up?
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:17:07
Hey if I was going to use my real name I wouldn't just randomly use a fake name other places

You got a license for that lemonade stand?
