Lol.  Thanks
@_date: 2016-03-13 23:06:39
Im cheap, and im new to all this.  I dont quite understand who is getting the fee?  Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2016-03-14 01:08:59
is fiat a term for cash?  
I could see that being useful, but because I just started using bitcoin, and I dont have many donations coming in, I would just like to stick with keeping the BTC that is donated.  At least for now.
@_date: 2016-03-13 23:38:27
And that fee gets converted to the "lottery" that happens?
@_date: 2016-03-14 02:59:08
so there is a max number of addresses one wallet can have?
@_date: 2016-03-14 00:35:35
So using stripe or bitpay is the safer, smarter option than just providing an address with a qr code?  Right?
@_date: 2016-03-13 21:53:57


are the 12 words suppost to be the passphrase?

Edit:  It did work, because the whole process was so sketchy when receiving bitcoin I got nervous.  After a whole 25 hours I downloaded the massive sync file for bitcoin core.  Im going to look into a mobile bitcoin app so I can keep my bit currency with me.

Just checking, thanks 4 explaining.  Was thinking of the cars lol
@_date: 2016-03-13 23:44:03
Its a very minor understanding. 
Took me 3 months to figure out how to make a wallet
@_date: 2016-03-14 01:16:47
So that means a single wallet could have infinite addresses correct?
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:13:48
If I try a new program though, would the bit coins that I purchased be only available on the core processor?  Or can I open the encrypted wallet on another program?
@_date: 2016-03-14 04:02:14
Thanks for explaining that. It now makes sense to me why I would care.  I didn't get it at first lol, figured so what, it's still secure, but then people might target me if there is large quantities of bit coin visable

So i've looked at them just briefly, and I've got to say.  Im not the most technical person in the world by any means.  I have a simple word press site which is under construction now.  Because its word press I think, at least for now I will need to find a plugin that will accommodate my stupidity.  ;D
@_date: 2016-03-14 04:13:24
It's cheaper than some credit card companies tho. I think
@_date: 2016-03-14 00:32:32


I havnet heard of them yet.
@_date: 2016-03-14 03:00:22


All hale the fee?
@_date: 2016-03-12 18:26:26
I think I did see it on that website. I'm just at the moment assuming that it's not updated. There were 34 weeks left to update last time I checked.
@_date: 2016-03-12 17:56:40
I don't know what those are.
@_date: 2016-05-07 22:06:58
Ya I did.  I figured if they closed up shop that second access would go away
@_date: 2016-05-07 21:14:09
backups as in?  I may not have them.  or Im not thinking about the same thing.  Sorry for being needy lol.
