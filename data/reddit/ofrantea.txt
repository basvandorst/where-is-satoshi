Even though my wallet says 1 bitcoin = $636. I feel like its worthless.
Cant buy nothing with it....

None of the gunshops around here accept bitcoin. The point of bitcoin is making transactions with anonymity right? In the end i still got to fill out a 4473.

One of my friends asked me to mail him some contraband.  And he asked if i knew about bitcoin. Didnt know what it was. Went to mexico. Got what he needed. Shipped it out.
At the time bitcoin was $150/1. But i just gave it away because i had no use for it.
For something worth more then american money. You cant buy shit with bitcoin. : /
