Upon careful review, we believe your account has engaged in prohibited use in violation of our Terms of Service and we regret to inform you that we can no longer provide you with access to our service. We respectfully request that you follow the on-screen instructions presented when you log into your Coinbase account to send any remaining balance offsite to an external address...
That was the random email I got I never used cryptocurrency to buy anything that is illegal in the United States of America or anywhere else for that matter.
It goes on to say they cannot elaborate on the reasons behind their decision which leads me to believe coinbase is invading people's privacy.

What is your major malfunction
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:51:01
Yea im furious about it.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:32:38
I get a message when I open the coinbase app saying the account is locked please go to our website and follow these directions yada yada yada so the email is definitely a genuine coinbase declaration of war against me

The money should already be removed from your bank account and committed to the transaction. 
You should be fine to close the account.

Thanks for your concern I'll answer your questions in the order you listed them
1. I only bought Bitcoin through coinbase nowhere else my bank account was linked as well as my debit or credit card whatever you want to call it I used my card because it's quicker then waiting on the bank option.
2. I move the Bitcoin I bought from coinbase to the wallets of the legitimate vendors. As far as I know they were all based in the United States and they were all used by many people. Nothing illegal nothing dangerous. All in all I only converted about $400 into Bitcoin through coinbase I spent about a hundred. The rest is locked in the coinbase account now and I refuse to pay any fees to coinbase for them to move my money into another companies wallet. Never did any trading of Bitcoin anything like that although I wish I had. I never moved Bitcoin to another Exchange  I always used coinbase. Let's see what else the weird thing I noticed is that coinbase locked my account right after I bought $50 worth of Litecoin through them switch is my first time purchasing Litecoin instead of Bitcoin but why would that give them reason to lock my account.
3. Nope I never received any Bitcoin from anybody else unfortunately however I did have a Bitcoin miner app on my phone but I never really used it because it would take years for me to gather the required amount of satoshis into the wallet. So I never tried depositing the satoshi's from the Bitcoin miner app. I never exchanged goods or services to obtain Bitcoin all I did was pay coinbase.
4. I wasn't involved at all in gdax, nor did I get involved in Bitcoin Trading although I wish I did like I said before.. anyway that's what I got I've sent multiple emails to coinbase support, and always get the same answer that is that cannot elaborate on the reason for shutting down my account and denying me access my own damn money.
Incredibly maddening.
I swear to God if anyone else makes fun of my grammar I'll throw my phone through the window

Thanks good to know i love Bitcoin don't get me wrong I've just never had it transaction stay in this limbo state for so long it kind of freaks me out
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:30:05
Ok thanks im sure i sent it to the correct address sooo im gona wait untill i can't wait no more :/
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:26:13
Ok i figured that,  i just noticed the fee that my wallet applied to this purchase was only .0003 btc so I'm figuring now this might take about a week has anyone ever just lost their money through waiting for a unconfirmed transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:17:02
What yes it has left my account,  its not in my wallet and it's not in the recipients wallet it is stuck waiting for confirmation and until then it's not in my wallet I can't do anything about it correct??
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:26:34
Oh ok i understand, so its in there i just cant see it well i really hope after the 48 hour mark that I'll be able to see it back in my wallet or at least have one confirmation on the transaction.. I don't know man I've never had to wait this long I guess it was my mess up accidentally paying a very low transaction fee but still it's kind of like torture waiting for it to either go through or not thanks for your help
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:33:51
Thank you yeah I was wondering about different wallets.. does transaction confirmation time vary by which wallet use I wasn't sure I don't think it does but maybe seems like you guys know a lot more than me
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:58:03

@_date: 2017-11-04 09:02:57
Thanks for your help. I have no idea why my blockchain wallet sent such a small fee, i selected the normal fee that is supposed to take an hour for the verification process to complete. Anyway yea i will wait and wait till Monday then ill be a mad man if it hasn't been verified so ill take action then good idea and thanks for your insight
