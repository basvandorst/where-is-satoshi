Thank you for the response and for replying with code, that was very cool. 
When an address has had lots of transactions though, I am still not sure how to request that from blockchain.info.  Using your code for an address like: 15urYnyeJe3gwbGJ74wcX89Tz7ZtsFDVew
effectively returns that last value in the JSON that is returned, but the list is not complete.  On the site you can change the URL to include "?sort=1" to get the first transaction first, but I can't figure out how to get that to work with the JSON page.

My thinking was that with this setup, the vendor does not need to take bitcoin. One person pays the vendor, and then everyone pays that person back their share in bitcoin.

This is a good feature.  I like to use bitcoin to pay my dad back when I owe him money, but I don't like the idea of him losing money because of the exchange rate.  He has actually just been happy to hang on to the bitcoins, but I am glad this is an option now.

Thanks for checking it out!  Multi-sig address generation does not call for randomness actually because the three input public keys should always produce the same multi-sig address.  My site does not let the user create new private key, and that is where most of the security needs to come in.  The redemption script does not really need to be a secret because it calls for the private keys of the input public keys.
You are right that it needs to be able to be saved like bitaddress.  I have a bit of work to do to get it up to bitaddress.org standards.  I think I just need to put all of my javascript onto one page so that it can save as one file.

@_date: 2014-04-06 14:16:21
You do not control the private keys with coinbase.  You could put a QR code on a piece of paper for one of the public addresses that they hold for you, but that would not really be a paper wallet.
You could go to bitaddress.org and make a paper wallet.  Then you could send BTC from coinbase to the paper wallet.  Be careful with paper wallets.

One of the hard things about buying bitcoin domain names is that they can end in anything (.com, .info, .io, .org)
I have bought up a couple myself, but I am always weighing it against buying some bitcoin.  Sometimes when I think of a really good domain name and then it turns out to be taken, I am kind of happy because I don't feel the pressure to buy it.
I bought  last week and I was pretty happy about that, I think as long as I use them for something they are worth it.

You should be able to save bitcore.js inside of the project.  I build web apps, so when I used bitcore I copied the text from bitcore.js and made a new js file in my project and pasted the code in.

You should not really sell paper wallets, especially to someone that is new to bitcoin.  Anyone selling preprinted paper wallets should be assumed to be a scammer because they could very easily have kept a copy for themselves.  The only way to do it right is to just have the person download the blockchain or mycelium app and do the trade that way.

If you are familiar with Dogecoin, then you already have a great start at understanding Bitcoin.  If you are in the US I would recommend you buy BTC from coinbase.com.  
Dogecoin adds a block to its blockchain every minute and Bitcoin adds a block every ten minutes.  There will be ~100 billion dogecoins and 21 million bitcoins.  Dogecoin uses a different mining algorithm than Bitcoin, so people were able to mine from home after they were no longer able to mine bitcoins at home.
Most importantly Bitcoin is cool because it was the solution to a previously unsolved problem and created the first pure money, while Dogecoin is just a copy of a copy.

I am making most of this up.  ETFs are composed of a group of stocks or whatever that seek to match the performance of a given market.  A specific ETF will be set up with its own rules of how the money will be invested.  So a bitcoin ETF might contain 5% Silver 5% Gold 5% USD and 85% BTC.  Some ETFs seek to double or triple a certain market. So someone buying the BTC ETF will not necessarily mean that the ETF is obligated to go purchase new BTC of the block for the market price.
So an EFT would be created with a certain amount of shares ready to go and then the market demand for those share will determine the price.  There are also groups like the Second Market that have been slowly accumulating BTC in order to provide the need liquidity in order for people to acquire large blocks of coins.

It is wallet dependent.  If you can manually enter the desired fee you should fully expect a tx to be added to the blockchain with a fee of .00001 BTC.
I have experiment with 1 Satoshi fees for fun and no fees by accident.  They might eventually go through, but it is annoying because all of the money that was in the address you were sending from will be in floating as an unconfirmed txs and your wallet might not let you try to send it again for a while.  Coinbase uses a .0002 tx fee for their blockchain txs.

I might be doing it wrong I guess.  I am trying to broadcast this transaction:
I think it is right, but blockchain.info does not like it.  I might see if armory can do it, but I was really hoping for an API or something.  I thought  might be able to do it because it is BitPay's project and they do multi-sig for CoPay.

The BTC community only has so much reach, so we cannot control what some other group tries to impose upon us.  The best way to define what a bitcoin is for tax purposes is to look at how it is being used.

You need the public keys to create the redemption script, but you do not need the public keys to spend from a multisig address, you need the redemption script and however many private keys.

Property rights are the foundation of an economy.  Without some guarantee that property will remain in the possession of the rightful owner, there is no incentive to grow more food than you can eat or to build a house or business. Property rights have been established in society through religion, government, and now code.  The Bible established property rights with fear, the U.S. Constitution established property rights with force, and Bitcoin establishes property rights with code.
The Bible tries to establish property rights by controlling people’s actions by making them fear a god.  The Bible demonstrates that God has the power to wipe out everyone on the planet with the story of Noah’s Ark and the Flood.  Then the Bible sets in stone The Ten Commandments, the last five of which are property rights.
“You shall not murder.”
“You shall not commit adultery.”
“You shall not steal.”
“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.”
“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
“If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.” Mark 9:43
I think this method of establishing property rights actually worked surprisingly well.
The U.S. Constitution established property rights by creating a system that can physically enforce them.  The system describes a way for people to be detained, judged by peers and sentenced for crimes. Crimes need to be described in laws created by democratically elected representatives.  
The Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Amendment all have something to do with property rights.
Second Amendment [Right to Bear Arms] 
Third Amendment [Quartering of Troops] 
Fourth Amendment [Search and Seizure] 
Fifth Amendment [Due Process]
Sixth Amendment [Criminal Prosecutions] 
Seventh Amendment [Common Law Suits] 
Eighth Amendment [Excess Bail or Fines] 
I think this method of establishing property rights has worked pretty well too.
Bitcoin establishes property rights with code.  Bitcoin protects property rights by replacing physical money with a publicly known ledger called the blockchain.  All money is limited in how fast and freely it can move as well as how safely it can be secured from seizure or theft.  Bitcoin allows an individual to take responsibility for their own money.

It is really just better to have everyone download a wallet on their phone, and then send them the coins.  Paper wallets sound like a cute gift, but it takes a bit of work to make them correctly.

If your grandparents give you paper wallets for Christmas be sure to sweep them over to your own wallet immediately.

There are a lot of good services now.  If you are really looking for a balance, maybe use a group of them.  Just add blockchain.info wallets and maybe even copay.io multisig wallets to your list, and I think the eggs are safe.

Since most of the other coins are exchangeable for bitcoin it kind of makes them like tools you can use.
You can go to  and 'convert your wealth into any altcoin you require'.  We should see a lot more multiple coin wallets soon.  I think bitcoin will win as money though.  I had given some thought to dogecoin winning as a currency and bitcoin winning as an asset, but since a short block time really just mean that more blocks need to be confirmed in order to have the same level of confidence in the transaction, I am not sure about that anymore.
Part of the value of a currency comes from the amount of places where it can be used, so it makes sense for everyone to use the same currency because then it has the most value to everyone.  
We can not turn lead into gold yet, but if one of the altcoins does something really great it might be able to be worked into bitcoin over time.

One of the keys to moving your bitcoin is to make sure that you have the place where you are moving it to backed up and stored in more than one location.  
Any wallet you get these days will have a 12 word phrase that is the backup.
I'd recommend creating a 2 of 4 multisig wallet using copay for amounts of bitcoin that you want to be really secure.  You could create this wallet by downloading copay of to 4 of your devices, like your phone, your computer, your tablet, and your old tablet, or whatever. Each will have its own 12 word phrase.
It can take some effort to create this wallet, but it will be secure and also free.
For less significant amount of bitcoin you should try breadwallet, Bitpay, or mycelium.

Besides fees, since the number of bitcoins only asymptotically approaches 21 million, new bits of coins could always be produced in each block, if the number of decimal places used for bitcoin were expanded to say 16 places instead of 8.
@_date: 2015-07-18 19:02:06
You can still mine it. Currently 25 bitcoins are created with every block and rewarded to the miner that verified and created that block.  
I do not mine bitcoin myself, so I guess I cannot give specific instructions, but I'll try.  To mine now you need to buy a new bitcoin ASIC miner, or a few of them and set them up on racks in your garage or basement.  In order to make money you probably need to be somewhere that has a low energy cost.  Miners get really hot, so if you are heating your house in the winter that could be good, but otherwise it is a lot of work to keep them cool.
Because your mining setup alone would be very unlikely to make the new block successfully and win the new coins, a lot of miners join mining pools.  A mining pool is a group of miners that divvy up the bitcoin reward among themselves according to how much hashing power they are each supplying to the pool, so that if one of them wins, they all get some bitcoin.

Krugman's points about Bitcoin:
"At this point, Bitcoin is not looking too good"
"Money is a pretty amazing thing... why does it have value... because people think it has value."
"However there is the anchor, for the dollar bill, which is not gold, it's the fact that you can use it to pay taxes."
"Then you have someone try to create Bitcoin, of which there is nothing in the end."
"It's supposed to be purely a self-fulling prophecy, levitating on itself; which is not impossible, but it's kind of unlikely."
"Bitcoin looks like it really is a bubble in multiple senses."
"It is a technically sweet solution to a problem, but it's not clear that that problem is one that has much economic relevance; certainly not a reason to hold that currency."
"There is a lot of libertarian ideology about it, so people were looking for something and they bought into it, literally bought into it for a while, but it has collapsed quite a ways."
"If you are looking for the idea that currency doesn't need to be something physical, it could be something that's virtual, that's the system we already have."
"If I want a way to make payments electronically, that's, you know, credit cards."
"Exactly what is it that this thing is doing that we don't already mostly do, I mean, there are technical differences, but pretty wild."
"We have four trillion dollars now in monetary base and it consist of nothing but ones and zeros."
"I mean so, what you know, the idea that I've got, uh oh, this brilliant new thing that's going to be digital, we are already there, you know, yeah."  - Paul Krugman

The price is not determined by the market cap divided by the total number of coins, the market cap is calculated by multiplying the number of bitcoins by the price of a bitcoin.
The bitcoin price is about what the last person was willing to pay for one.
To sell 1,000,000 bitcoins you would need to find people who wanted to buy 1,000,000 bitcoins.  The price would probably go down because of the sudden increase in supply.

I recommend that you buy another one though so that if Bitcoin explodes in the future you don't have a horrible story about how you bought a bitcoin at $100 and lost it.  Now is a good chance to scoop up another coin.
A lot of wallets now use a 12 word phrase as a seed for each wallet so that you only need those 12 words to recover your funds.
I recommend Coinbase, Circle, or Gemini for buying  bitcoins.
Then I recommend Bread wallet and Copay for storing the bitcoins.

It is really cool, but the most important part of an exchange is fiat to digital, and back.

If you watch the whole talk you will hear multiple times when it seems like they are surely about to mention Bitcoin, but then continue on like it doesn't exist or they don't know about it.

He was the first person to teach me about bitcoin.

For a lot of people, buying a fund is a lot easier than buying bitcoin because they can use their existing trading platforms to purchase something in the same way that they would buy Coca-Cola stock.  Not everyone is going to want to manage passwords that are worth money.

Can you post a link to the site that does that?

The amount of transactions processed is still up to each miner.  It makes sense to increase the block size because otherwise pure Bitcoin will not be able to handle the amount of transactions that are happening in the world.
There was no block limit originally, and now with floating miner fees, there are not good reasons for a miner not to throw another transaction into their block if a market fee is being paid.

That is pretty great. I'm excited to get home and get it setup for my gravatar account, and think about how I can use it in my sites that already get profile pictures using an email address and gravatar.

The 2nd halving will be in 41,682 blocks, around July 26, 2016, and the block reward will be reduced from 25.0 to 12.5 bitcoins.

There are lots of things that seem like they should be worth less than Bitcoin, like a building, but that's why it's so exciting. SnapChat is cool, and if investors think something could be the next Facebook, everyone wants a piece. Plus an app that focus on sexting makes a lot of sense and seems obvious with hind-sight.

I meant it as the interest rate over the next 365 day.

EmojiBeans are deterministically created based on the hashes of a bitcoin address and the hash of the first block that that address is included in. On the colored part of a card, around an emoji, the number in the upper left corner is the age of the bitcoin address in days. The hearts in the bottom left corner are "rarity hearts" where the odds of getting 1 heart is 1 in 5 and the odds of getting five hearts is 1 in 3125. The little emojis on the upper right corner of the colored part of a card the lower right corner change with every block, and are meant to be used to compare cards. Each card also has a voice. Clicking on something on the card should make it say something. When the site is loaded the latest block of cards is being displayed and can be swiped through.
Right now it is only possible to make emojibeans by spending coins to a new address, or to look up emojibeans by searching for any old address.  In the future the cards should be comparable and tradable.

There are currently .00214511 bitcoins per person on Earth. 
Given that a bitcoin currently cost $677, there are only enough bitcoins for every person to have $1.45 worth.
If bitcoins were distributed using the current global distribution of wealth, 99.9% of people would have $0.28 worth of bitcoins, and people in the top .001% would have 0.64 bitcoins each.

I just built an emoji trading card game using Bitcoin. Unfortunately it hasn't increased my networth by $7.8 billion.

I'd like to make an API so they could be posted on other sites, but I haven't got to that yet.
@_date: 2016-07-17 14:47:11
Thanks for the feedback, I think I will do that today.
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:03:09
I posted this because the article mentioned Bitcoin, but now that has been changed.

I built a URL for addresses: 
I still need to add a share button or something. Thanks for the suggestion.
@_date: 2016-07-23 01:36:24
Now there is a link button too.  I'll need to think about how to embed something.
