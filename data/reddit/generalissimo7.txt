I got a 404 page not found.

I do not like coinmap and never have. Too many sites are allowed to list themselves with no obvious connection to bitcoin. It has always been just a waste of my time.
I've even emailed some of them and they don't accept bitcoin.
I do not understand the appeal of coinmap.org. 
Can we agree that coinmap.org will never be what it promised?

I'm sorry, but I have no solution better than coinmap. I give kudos to the developer for a great technical solution: at this point, it can only be as good as the people that use it.

I contacted Jay Clarke on the 'contact' page and asked him via email if they accepted bitcoin, to which he merely answered 'no.'
Literally, just "No." This leads me to believe that Jay put his web site up on there, because, HEY GOOGLE!!!! Caring nothing at all for bitcoin in his response, such as "Oh, yeah, we should probably take that off the map... we did take bitcoin, but now do not."
No, you see, it's easier for him to just put his web site on there, me to drive up there, think I'm going to have my first ever "live" transaction, only to find that I am a fucking sucker.
So I'm not insulting the implementation, I'm insulting the peer-review of posted sites. It's just too easy to put my site up there if I'm hurting for business, regardless of anything to do with bitcoin or not.
I'm sorry I'm railing here, but I've wasted tons of time on coinmap hoping to have a "real life" bitcoin transaction only to just say, "Fuck it. Bitcoin for me is an internet currency."
The level of discouragement that I have personally felt in using coinmap is too damn high!

Ok. I will do my part to make the world a better place.

Don't take it personally. I've had 25 accounts in the last year.
Reddit is fundamentally flawed. People look at your comment karma before downvoting. Therefore, if it's positive, it gets upvoted. Negative: downvoted.
Reddit is, in many ways, the Devil. It claims to be a community. It is NOT a community!

I had to cancel the order or give a correct phone number. If you don't find that forceful, then move on.
Look... Seriously. If you think government is your friend, go for it. Knock yourselves out. Obviously, many people must think that government is their friend or it could not exist in its current form. 
I was anti-government before I was pro-bitcoin. A lot of people are becoming anti-government THROUGH bitcoin. This has always seemed really strange to me. So many people trying to cooperate with the IRS. So many people using exchanges. I always thought the entire point of bitcoin was P2P. Where is the IRS in P2P? Where is the Federal Government? Where is Amagi Metals???? Which 'P' is that? To me, bitcoin was always anti-government. It was a Godsend for THAT reason!
Look. I'm only going to say this one time. We are living in a time when the government is working AGAINST YOU. YOU ARE THE ENEMY OF THE STATE. 
If you are not actually aware of this, then you're a copper-top, and there is not much I can do for you except point out that humongous elephant in the room and move on. Take care.

Take it or leave it. It is a free country...
So I bought from Amagi metals and the shopping cart somehow messed up, and I got an email from Amagi saying that they received a headless payment of some kind, and that I needed to supply all the details all over again.
No problem. I gave my order details, my address, and the phone number that I always use: 954 555 1212.
Whether I am hearing-impaired is NOT important to this story!
I received an email saying that they could not complete the order because the phone number wasn't real. And was forced to give a real phone number. 
In my opinion, Amagi metals simply does not understand the bitcoin's counter-regulatory nature. Having to supply a phone number -- usable or not -- by FORCE is basically a teacher finding me under the bleachers and telling me to put my cigarette out and go to class. When the teacher didn't need to do anything (long out of high school, btw -- is just a simile!)
Based on what I perceive bitcoin to be: A life-preserver for self-regulating free-thinking people who can act on THEIR OWN AUTHORITY -- which is sorely lacking in this world -- based on what I perceive bitcoin to be, I have to decry Amagi metals at every opportunity for being a teacher's pet, a narc, what have you.

Rockbox? I'm having 2005 flashbacks. Not 2,005 flashbacks, but I mean...  Rockbox...wow

Amagi does not respect privacy. But Agora Commodities does. 
I have bought from both of them... but from Amagi...NEVER AGAIN!
Agora all the way.
