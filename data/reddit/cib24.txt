I hope something like Bitcoin makes it but with the way trading has been the last 2.5 days new investors are going to be scared and run to something more stable, something that is regulated by a government and doesn't fluctuate like crazy every 30 seconds. Right now, no one knows what the true value of a bitcoin is and thus they can't be spent in real commerce situations. 
Also, just because there were reports of some VC investors and the like does not mean that those investments have actually been made. Most likely, there have been a few handshakes here and there and now that they see the market fluctuating the way it is most of those VC investors will be scared away.
Bitcoin is a nice idea but it needs more stability ASAP otherwise it will go the way of the sabre tooth tiger because no one can trust it, especially when you are dealing with a down economy where most people don't have a lot of extra money to take a chance on bitcoin with.

Welp, this ought to lag the hell out of everything and cause prices to plummet. You better get your limit buys/sells in before the lag makes everything un-tradable. Good luck to the speculators out there hoping to make their money back...

He is totally right. The volatility that is about to be seen is going to be legendary. If you think you can outguess the unpredictable then go ahead and try. Most who attempt it end up failing but you might get lucky before the ultimate fall...

Think of all of the speculators on the bitcoin exchanges right now  as all of those tech companies from the dot com boom. Only a few make it out alive and live to see the sunshine. The rest, like the infamous pets.com lose all of their money due to a crash.

I'm not saying that your "if we build it they will come" mentality won't work. It might, but at least in the short term bitcoin is proving to be too dangerous for people to use as an actual currency rather than a punting vehicle to try to make a quick buck.
I get where you are coming from though and I do hope it takes off because the technology is certainly fascinating.

What happens in a bubble is that people begin adjusting their required returns as the market begins to fall. It's only the ones who have all to lose that never sell and pray it goes back up to at least their initial purchase price. But when the market is falling people no longer want to earn say 50%, they are willing to accept 25%, then 12.5%, then 5%, then breakeven, and so on.
