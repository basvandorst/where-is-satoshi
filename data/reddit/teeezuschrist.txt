I don’t quite understand that. Haha
What about coinbase?
@_date: 2019-05-08 04:31:33
What’s a good exchange? And if I sent it to uphold would I get the key through that?
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:25:12
What about uphold?
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:16:55
If I were to buy with the cash app, would I actually own the bitcoin whereas I wouldn’t with Robinhood
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:32:51
Yeah, that’s not to much of a problem.
The thing is they only let you buy certain increments on cash app? I wanted to just be able to purchase 1 whole bitcoins worth but I don’t think that’s possible on there
@_date: 2019-05-08 03:58:27
So which app/wallet is best to purchase bitcoin that I WOULD own with keys? Haha
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:28:59
Good to know! 
So I purchase bitcoin on cash app, transfer to uphold or any wallet then I’m home free?
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:26:12
Then what app do you suggest buying it on safely?
@_date: 2019-05-08 04:41:36
The apps you listed all have terrible reviews for being scammy. Seems sketchy.
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:27:57
Sell for cash? As in withdrawing to your linked bank account? I don’t see what the problem would be with that.
@_date: 2019-05-08 04:27:14
Wow. It’s a lot more confusing than I initially believed. 
I will definitely check out said apps!
Thank you so much for your help. 
What’s a good outlet to learn as much as I can about bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-08 03:35:48
��‍♂️��‍♂️ that’s why I’m here asking what the best route is to buy a bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:39:04
I have an uphold account? What if I just used that
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:29:29
I just want to buy a damn Bitcoin. This is ridiculous haha
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:21:20
They don’t allow withdrawal whenever you want?
@_date: 2019-05-08 03:52:57
I understand.
I do have a wallet with Uphold, but it doesn’t show anything about keys anywhere?
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:15:53
Where do you buy your bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:07:41
Does coinbase have this security key that everybody is talking about or is the key just provided in the wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-08 02:57:48
I just wanted to be able to buy 1 bitcoin, but the max per day on Uphold is 500 dollars so that would take quite a while to accrue one coin
