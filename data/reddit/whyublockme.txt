That's sat/B. "Typical" legacy transaction with one input and two outputs is 225 bytes. You pay a certain amount for the whole transaction. So yes, it's possible to effectively go fractional in terms of sat/B.

I think median transaction fee is a more useful gauge than average.

Also, the replenishment can be done directly by your employer on payday. Just like direct deposits to a checking account today, you can get paid directly to your channel. In essence, it's like a decentralized checking account.
Can't wait for that to happen.

Ah, thanks for that. Totally missed that. However there is this:




**This** kinda implies that this is a temporary thing (during the bootstrap phase), and will probably go away once LN picks up steam.

Well, article is more than a year old. It references [the spec]( where I wasn't able to find these limitations.
Not saying that this was never in the spec, but it's not there now.

Is redeem script for Segwit address always constructed as

or are there any variations?
On a related note, where can I find good and detailed technical documentation on how Bitcoin works (besides reading Bitcoin Core code)? I found this:  but it's not very detailed. I'm interested mostly in wallet-related stuff.

I think that this by itself is quite significant.

Money is power, so whoever controls the money, has power. If they can't control the money, they're powerless. With Bitcoin, you control your own money and no one else, and that's what they're afraid of.

Do they accept Bitcoin as payment?

Slow news day? Nobody likes extra fees, but even assuming it's true (I'm too lazy to check), it's a free market. If you don't like it, no one forces you to use Coinbase. And it's a business, which is designed to make money, but if they can't compete, there will be someone else who takes their place.

Oh, no, I'm not selling my BTC no matter what, unless I reach my Moon - then I'll probably sell some. Because I haven't invested more than I'm willing to lose, and that's why question like yours never popped up in my mind.

His/her question is self-contradictory. If you're a true believer in Bitcoin, then you don't sell no matter what. But if you do sell on the price fluctuation alone, then you're not a true believer.

Whether this is your original intent or not, but these kind of posts are typically posted in the attempt to spread FUD, drop the price of Bitcoin, and make people sell. This allows whales to accumulate even more.  
If you followed the general advice not to invest more than you can loose, regardless of what you're trying to achieve by investing into BTC, then this shouldn't even be a question.

Generally speaking, mining is a well-designed self-balancing process. If mining becomes more profitable, then more miners will join, which will pull profitability down. If mining becomes less profitable, then miners with highest costs will start operating at a loss and will have to stop mining thus increasing profitability for the other miners till the balance is reached again.
So as long as Bitcoin has some value and some people want to transact it once in a while, there will be someone willing to mine.

Yeah, we all know that. And that's why we're here.

Sadly, yes. And actually, there's been quite a bit of retrogression. A lot more people than 5 years ago have some sort of data cap now. Thanks to monopoly.
I have Comcast and that's realistically my only option, as my next "best" option is 3mbps DSL. I'm on 1TB data cap for more than a year and I can pay $50 on top of my $150 monthly bill (with cable TV included) to get data cap removed.
