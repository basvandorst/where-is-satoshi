This is actually quite hilarious!

Yea the on on top is public key but the on in cave is private key and that's what I'm worried about :)
@_date: 2013-08-07 19:34:16
I love my Victorinox, and I love Bitcoins so huge yes.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:31:07
And now I put some coins in there too, so now my Minecraft save is worth of 0.01. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 20:03:33
Who knows might be something relating to bandwidth limits.
@_date: 2013-05-24 21:37:05
It has only public key, the private key is on my safe. :)

Yea, I mined for Slush earlier today while BTC Guild was under attack. But BTC Guild seems to work normally now.

Oh for heavens sake not the doge.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:49:00
So did your son end up wanting to buy balls?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:03:47
Yeah it's in the cave partially behind a cliff so I have to work before I can redeem it :D
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:20:41
I re-created my paperwallet on Minecraft. :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:04:35
Yep, that would help in these situations when exchanges like Mt.Gox goes under. If only it was possible to untie the value by snapping some switch. :/
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:58:40
For real? What is this tipping frenzy?
@_date: 2013-07-08 14:36:43
Yea, but might as well paste different link. I enjoyed more the Bitcoin magazines article than just cluttered forum post.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:55:51
Shay whaaat?!
@_date: 2013-05-25 07:21:05
Just search 'Custom Made ID Cards' and choose one the sellers that let you supply your own image. I ordered from this one: 
@_date: 2013-07-08 19:34:28
The price depends on the seller. I could sell my BTC in Bitstamp for 5$ and then the last price would be 5$, but it would not stay on it for long.
@_date: 2013-05-14 08:00:52
How can I use that? I downloaded all the required stuff and your stuff, but I'm really lost with Python. I have almost never used it. :/
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:53:21
Well I have all my bitcoins distributed in small amounts on paperwallets, and I have safe deposit box on bank where I keep those. At first I had just very small safe at home on my closet, but when I moved to anorther home and it was made of wood, then guess what, my OCD kicked in and told me 'what if there's fire' so I got safety deposit box.

@_date: 2013-12-18 17:24:14
Oh no I'm not that skilled.
@_date: 2013-07-12 21:27:42
Oh lord me wants to buy some of those. From where I can buy them? EDIT: So it seems that Casascius is selling them directly to customers again.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:42:49
I got mine 4 hours ago after 15 minute wait. So hopefully it should work, it just might take a while.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:44:56
I just now noticed your tree fiddy. Thank you very much.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:08:48
Whoah thanks! I think I shall build a statue for you in the same map :D
@_date: 2013-07-08 20:17:07
I stand corrected. I've never used Bitstamp so I could not be sure how it works. : )
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:57:17
I've tried to buy more, but there's no way for me at the moment.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:45:04
Yeah I also thought of that. I also have my own server now and then open so I might do that for some friends. :D
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:38:09
Pineapple Express... I know bad joke.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:54:02
Yeah it's wool and you sir have a good point. I think i'm going to take of the lava.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:56:45
I somehow redeemed my karma as bitcoins but it was something like 0,0001... so at least the account works.
