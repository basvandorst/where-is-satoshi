This is the opposite of the relationship between futures and the underlying asset on which the value of the futures contract is based: Futures are derivatives (based on an underlying asset) of Bitcoin. 
As others point out, the futures price is the price at which  people are willing to buy and sell bitcoin in the future. The spot price of bitcoin (the current fiat price) will approach the futures price because people already have contracts (i.e., futures) to buy/sell in the future at that price. The futures price is whatever bitcoin is worth to the purchaser in the future. Futures are merely a tool to hedge price volatility, read up on the original use of futures for agricultural output where farmers would arrange to sell their harvest at a price in the future to hedge against low prices when the growing season was up.

Hypercubechain already made this irrelevant

For sure, BTC has futures and chain analysis may start to be able to doxx wallet holders; xmr is the new dark net currency

I came here just to point this out; thank you

Larger bills, up to $10,000 and $100,000 in USD were generally used inter-bank; digitization of USD transfers removed that use case and then the bills were removed from circulation; though, given the serialization of USD bills, I would imagine that using them would be very hard if they existed, how much scrutiny do $100 bills receive

We should care more about de-centralizing pools and industrial miners than total hashrate at this point, yes. BTC is far and away the highest total hashrate of any chain; more hashrate (all else equal) is better, but this increase is correlated with an increase in miner concentration. This is not within the original goals of decentralization of mining for decentralization of control; if people still find pool concentration a viable attack vector.
