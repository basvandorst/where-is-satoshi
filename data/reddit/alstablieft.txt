people don't really care about that one article and misspelling of hodl,
I find it rather annoying, it's been 5 years, move on now.

i tryed to buy bitcoins on BTCDirect, I went to blockchain and put in the adress I get when I click on rexeice,
What do I do?
Did i just lose the money
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:31:05
I mailed them asking to change the adress 20 minutes after payment,
Their reply=
your payment has been received succesfully, and will be paid out as fast as possible, currently there's an error in the system which causes it to function slower, sorry for the inconvenience.

hey, ze sturen me net dat het receive adres gekoppeld is aan mijn wallet, en dus het het juiste adres is,
opgelucht man
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:16:33
i have no clue where to find the confirmatio',
it just shows the cost and my blockchain receiver Id,
 I don't get how i can't have the coins??
Iif the coins didn't send I should just get my money back? :(
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:49:17
if my bitcoins can't be sent to the adress they should just refund it to my bank card,
Am i the only person in the world to ever buy bitcoins on a blockchain receiver adress?
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:32:26
when you head over to blockchain.info and click on "receive" you'll see an adress that changes every so often,
Now the adress is no more there as in my payment,
this is making me very scared.
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:27:08
2.the adress is not the same :'(
3. the adress has refreshed
4.yes copy paste was correct
But wow, it should be in my blockchain receiver :(
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:18:03
dat zou ik zelf niet weten waar ik dat kan vinden, aangezien ik geen mail heb gekregen dat de coins zjin gestuurd
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:22:01
I bought the coins from BTCDirect website where it shows my payment status is completed
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:34:04
is there any confirmation on when this bcash would take place?
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:40:50
Panic sell bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:07:18
panic sell
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:05:00
I wanted to buy bitcoins on BTCDirect,
I copy-pasted my receive adress from blockchain and proceeded,
the confirmation transaction is shown in BTCDirect
Did I just lose my money?
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:37:28
currently the support in my counyry is unavailable,
i'm just very afraid that they will tell me: We can't change the adress or send you back your money or something similiar,
Am I really the first person ever to mistaken the receive and the buy adress??
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:01:55
ik had eerder al €100 in bitcoin gestoken enkel via blockchain, Maar blockchain leek een duurdere prijs,
dus kk dacht BTCdirect te gebruiken,
En ik had van vorige mails confirmatie dat het verstuurt was, maar bij deze niet.
geeft me toch een beetje moed dat ik het ergens kan veranderen en niet een random persoon zowat €900 heb gestuurd
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:54:24
een backup? is online niet genoeg dan?
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:25:14
i don't know much about litecoin nor ethereum,
I just feel like bitcoin is the real deal, and those other currencies are not really fluctuating
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:24:32
Can't bitcoin jsut deposit the bitcoins on my blockchain??
I copy pasted "MY WALLET"
Why would i have lost them??
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:02:02
I would suggest waiting,
I'm not a future seeker so don't take me for granted,
But I can tell the price will see a massive decline shortly,
followed by a rise again,
if anything, I would suggest stepping in after a decline, and keep looking on price changes
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:09:01
but some guy wanted to invest 7years ago in bitcoin
and he said his parents called it a scam!
what a waste!
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:08:12
But it was my blockchain wallet adress,
it has been almost an hour ago, and still shows 0 BTC
i'm afraid I just lost $1000 :(
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:35:53
there are no transactions involving this adress,
Please I can't sleep
I need to know how to resolve my issue
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:07:20
there just shouldn't be an option to enter an adress since you're logged to 
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:01:20
after 14hours of ordering I did receive my bitcoins!
So I know that blockchain receive adress works just as the wallet adress,
this is a relieve
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:42:34
BTC needs a centralized company which can support people on refunds and make it safer
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:47:51
it'll be ok
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:22:03
Thank you for your generosity sir
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:21:42
the people should realise that this bitcoin technology is independent of the government or any sort, people should stimulate this
long live bitcoin technology!
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:25:35
Just bought in another 0.1 BTC, who's with me
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:26:02
Can't get taxed if you don't cash out!
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:42:09
