hmm two years horizon! copy that! I will check out the story you painted here and learn from it. thank for this awesome point of yours

Here you! the fact is simple. If I have enough money I can buy the token and sell at any time. There is what is called investor mind and speculator mind, a project can be new and you leverage on the information you have research on to determine your continuity with the project. Firstly, do your research on the owner of the project, do your research on the team and follow the trend they follow to ascertain whether they are a scam or not.
Uptrennd point was opened for exchange before but due to people like you that is ready to scop all the reward and runaway, the plan to make the project stabilized before a withdrawal is engaging again is a welcome idea. 
speculators are a trader and you can decide to buy and keep or buy to sell when the price appreciates, does anything wrong in there? wait a minute is this project for 2 years? What is the difference in platforms that requires a minimum value of the token in your wallet before you withdraw and the one that locks up the system for the wallet because of there still in beta?
If the token is listed on the exchange and the team is selling, is there no means of you to get 1UP free on parjar to sell? 
For your information, 1UP is on Coinmarketcap at the moment and I will need a point from you aside selling the token you mentioned as an evidence of scam by uptrennd. What have you invested and how has uptrennd looks like a scam to you? I will wait to receive from you.

Thats for your comment

Yes, users can not withdraw but the employees are users too. Like me, I am a user and if I did something for uptrennd I earn the token via my parjar bot and I can exchange it if I want. uptrennd platform is still on the bet you don't except the point withdrawal to be enabled now... You guys are just ready to rip all the reward and render the platform useless. this won't work.

I don't know how to add an image but I receive 5000sat from unknown wallet...with a message:
**USER MESSAGE**
**it works and for small amounts, it should be safe enough;)**
I have not added my reddit account before so i just did and receive 5000. i added only my twitter before now

 I just copied it from my dashboard web

The reason why I'm concerned is because I got information that whales are the makers and takers when it comes to trading and they can effect change at any times.

When you see the use case of a coin increasing it will definitely increase the number of people that make use of that coin. Nice update through uptrennd
@_date: 2019-10-15 20:10:03
That positive sign is what I need to be clear with.  Is bull run close by?

Saying someone is foolish is actually not a right way to correct rather you need to drop your opinion than usually using odd word on commenting. Thanks for your use of word anyway by not a right approach
