Sounds like things I'd like to buy but shipping will be a problem.

I read it a few months back and can't remember this plot.

I heard about a bit coin 101 event in Bali and thought they had good tactics. At the event they teach everybody about bitcoin, how to install and use a wallet, and finally how pay with bitcoin or transfer to a different wallet. 
For the event, participants had to pay 10 dollars, but at the end they went home with a wallet and 10 dollars worth of bitcoin. So basically it was a free event. 
Thought that this is a great way to introduce people to bitcoin.

I never used a darknet market. But I wish there would be a way to audit the security.

I'm selling a few surfboards.

Which boom was that? I remember reading this and feeling amused and sad at the same time. Can't recall which book it was though.

I so need to high five someone now!
@_date: 2014-11-02 09:23:09
How many coins is that? Can't do math atm.

Where in the world is a dunkin donut 10 cents? I need to go there. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:13:16
but who do you donate to?
@_date: 2016-03-14 19:08:05
No, if the operational costs are higher than the returns, it is not the best option to continue offering it. The dev costs are the sunk costs, now if the returns are less than operations than you scrape it. See any project of Google or other company that gets scraped.

This sounded like the opposite. 
Also yeah I didn't touch any of that, because I'm not going to start to teach eco101 to a bunch of teenagers here. Just trying to widen their horizon a little bit.

So what? 
Lets say it's easy to integrate, but before it comes to that, there is a huge discussion with a big group of people, until the decision is made to include bitcoin as a payment gateway. Lets assume about 15-20 man days are spent in total on that. 
It's easy to integrate, but the library is used in 5 different systems, and each has to be integrated individually. 10 days.
Then each has to be tested, and eventually deployed 10. 
A company like Microsoft spends at least 35-40 man days on a decision like that. And I would think that this is really the lower bound. Let's say one man days costs them around $1500, that is a minimum of $50k.
MS is a huge corporation and any decision they make costs a lot of money. I'd even bet that this decision has cost them 5 times as much as in my simple calculation above.

Dev costs?
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:04:05
I cost that much our clients and I'm just a senior dev. Management of course doesn't get paid like that, but they cost a lot more.
These decisions don't get made by juniors.
@_date: 2016-05-10 14:56:13
What's after the 2000 sign ups, will they costs something? I don't think so, otherwise they will miss lots of customers, as they're real revenue is the 0.5% fee for each purchase.
@_date: 2013-10-16 13:23:24
I'm not sure if it is a must. Whenever I do a sepa transaction it states that if the amount is over 12.5k they *may* have to report it. 
Isn't a European bank employee here in this thread?
@_date: 2013-10-16 12:03:52
I think it's 12.5k.

+1 for using an escrow service. Otherwise its just to risky. Which has nothing to do with this shop being in Iran. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:23:06
Thanks.

[This is]( how the interface looks for me, I can't see a checkbox nor a text that describes the fee.
Is it different for you?

Sorry but this is a stupid comment as content changes constantly on the front pages. Not helpful at all for someone who comes here tomorrow or in twenty years and reads this comment.

Because I don't care about power, but I like the freedom wealth provides.

I applied for verification on bitstamp and got verified 5 mins later. That was about two weeks ago.

Let's look at the one big bubble earlier this year. It was growing stable to around 30, then the bubble hit and it went up to 270. That's 9 times the value growth within a short period of time. After the bust it settled at around 100, still 3.3 times more worth than before the bubble.
Let's play the same scenario with the current value:
~125 * 9 = ~1125 -&gt; ~410
IMHO 1000 bucks after the bubble is not very realistic, but then again I'm not saying the bubble with have the same size, shape or intensity overall like the last one. So anything goes. 
And who knows if it is a bubble in at all.

Excellent idea, similar to gold markets
@_date: 2013-10-08 20:54:43
Thanks for weasel words. Might use that in the future.

it's the bitcoin sub after all, isn't it?
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:31:45
Just checked and that option doesn't exist for me. Thanks anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:22:27
So they just take a flat fee?
@_date: 2013-10-08 21:22:29
Except your argument is invalid as most products, well, can be produced. So they can be sold today and tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-10-08 20:50:51
Thanks for pointing me in the direction. I will read up on that. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 07:50:03
It's not really off if we're in a bubble currently.
@_date: 2013-11-04 23:10:13
Bitstamp and gox have limit orders too.

I'd definitely use a program for it. It is possible manually but that takes time and is error prone. Don't forget to make heeps of copies of the encrypted paper wallet and store it all over the place. In case you're dog eats it or something.
