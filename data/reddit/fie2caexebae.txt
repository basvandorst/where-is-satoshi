To a point. Doesn't protect you from malware on your machine, but it does stop an opportunistic theft. Still make a paper backup. 


Because the wallet is already stored encrypted. It doesn't need to be enceypted again.

Electrum is fairly forceful about getting people to write down their seeds. It present it, tells you to write it down, and then won't continue unless you type it back in again. It's as close to foolproof as you can get. The OP wasn't wise in what they did though

You can only do that if the client is stupidly broken and create bad random numbers. Can't happen normally. You're fine with armory.

**Take the SD card out of your phone right now. Don't eject it. Do it now.** 
Your keys are still on it. You will be able to recover your private keys from the SD card almost instantly if you follow my instructions. 
Download a copy of Data Rescue 3 (yes, it's an OSX app) and use it to scan the SD card while it's in the slot of your Mac. The trial will do as you can recover a single file up to 10MB. Do an "extended" or "deep" scan of the mounted SD card and then look through the recovered files to find your backup PDF. At this point it's almost certain that your keys are still there if you act properly.

Fresh wallet. New wallet. New password.

Indeed. While it's very technically advanced, Bitcoin is anything but user friendly. Though if everybody used Electrum, we wouldn't have these problems.

If you're going to make a fake market website:
* don't copy the source from BitStamp
* "sell" is not spelled "shell"
Just a sloppy job.

That's very pleasant actually.
