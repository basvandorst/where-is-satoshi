It's real. This screenshot shows the main part of the email. The blue lines on the side link up to the blue venmo at the top

This was the first time I'd used lightning network outside of experimenting with my casa node. It was super easy and was cheaper than fiat, which was neat.

Exactly, it's this big brother mentality. Critics of privacy will say that you shouldn't worry if there's nothing to hide, but here I am with my account restricted, MY money being effectively seized or withheld from me, and in this world money has a direct relationship with your value.
And here I am with my money being restricted over a 7 dollar sandwich because the authorities thought it may be something more.

Yea this was no glamour shot

The account was placed under some restrictions but they just removed them

I disagree strongly. I believe we deserve the ability to opt out.

Didn't realize venmo would question me over my transactions. Especially over a Cuban sandwich

Fuck bitpay. Use ln.pizza for pizza. Here's why
• No fees (1 or 2 sats are nothing, sorry).
• No risk of overpayment, ln payment requests let you pay the specified amount _only_.
• No waiting on block times. Instant payment.
• No specific wallet you're forced to use. Use a full node or a custodial (easier although unrecommended). Standard encoding (BOLT11) means all ln wallets will work.

Glad to see whole foods support added here. Big fan of the app!

Totally agree. Especially since this is something intended to be used in store
