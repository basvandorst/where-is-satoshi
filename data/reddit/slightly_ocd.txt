Just done some more digging and I think the bitcoinvanity address generating is at fault.
This thread 
on bitcointalk details another had the same issue, and again on bitcointalk the user nibor who is the owner of the site has posted that his sister site a pinball gambling game has been hacked.
Would still be grateful for any other opinions

MTGox via a money transfer, HSBC charged me £17 and it was with them the morning after.  You can then decide when exactly to buy the coins.  Ive used blockchain as well but you are limited for the first month to a low amount

Have you tried to withdraw from Bitstamp?  Im struggling to get any info out of their support on how I withdraw some US dollar funds back to the UK, how they will process the dollars to a UK bank and at what rate.  Any experience?

Has anyone managed to withdraw money from bitstamp back to the UK? Ive sold a few BTC and want to withdraw the dollars but cant find any info on how they process the withdrawal apart from:
*You always have to insert U.S. dollar amount you wish to withdraw. This amount will be converted to the selected currency, free of charge.*
Where can you see that they use a corporate rate and what the rate is?
