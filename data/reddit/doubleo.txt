thx, yeah, i was thinking it could be a risk but if i keep my paper wallets safe it's easier to keep one password. my feleing is a password for every paper wallet will create more risk or mixups or possible confusion especially if they are not used for a veyr long time..
@_date: 2014-09-28 11:39:08
yes, this is correct as far as I understand, but my point is different wallet apps treat change address differently. also, with mycelium 2.0, which is supposed to have HD wallet characteristics, I am not sure what the default action would be --- if change still goes back to the same paper wallet, or if they default to a new address ostensibly to imnprove security, of if there are settings one can select, etc...............so i would be careful everytime there is a new update to the wallet app so that you can be sure to know how change addresses are treated or what the default settings are in case they change with app updates..

I am not implying that governments will stop using their own currency, but instead of holding dollars or gold or some other hard currency, which is what governments do to settle international payments or diversify their holdings, that some percentage of their holdings may go into bitcoin.

this is excellent. I noticed the camera icon and wondered if it came with the recent update or if i just missed it after all this time. 
Minor suggestion on graphical interface. The links on the balance screen go in this order:  Send - camera icon - Receive. For some with smaller android screens, or those with clumsy fingers, the link to touch the camera icon is too small, and close to the send/receive links. If its possible to study the design a bit more, maybe use larger more squarish buttons and spread them better over the screen. I dunno. I'm sure you guys will come up with improvements. 
Also looking forward to the HD feature.

I think that the resilience of Bitcoin is critical. But agree with the points raised here:
a) the network effect will keep it relevant
b) the opensource, decentralized nature will keep it adaptive and responsive, 
c) Its ledger and historical value will keep it super sticky
d) sidechains will enable multifaceted usage to address all sorts of blockchain-related services
all of these will make switching costs fairly high in terms of a totally different protocol. 
The one concern I do have, however, is how long it would take for sidechains to actually happen and the evolution of the protocol seems to take longer than I'd like. I do think developers need to be very conservative and careful so they don't screw the software and testing needs to be very thorough. But we do need a clear roadmap with rough timelines for milestones that we are all looking for. To name some:
a) built-in privacy features at the protocol level, 
b) sidechain integration
c) colored coin capabilities with standards we all agree on
d) improved scalabililty
e) improved security to keep this decentralized and impossible to manipulate by bad actors
To end this, I think the entire community has a responsibility to help the development community and the overall ecosystem in any way they can - through ideas, public outreach to clarify misconceptions, contributing code, testing, supporting btc businesses and donations to good causes. I think massive bitcoin adoption will happen, it's just a matter of when and where. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 05:36:24
by the way, i love the app, wish it was cross platform to include android as well. hopefully you will get enough support from the community to enable that. 
the one feature that I didn't find when using it recently was the ability to send all funds and calculate an appropriate miner fee if you want to clean out a paper wallet or an address. i had to manually calculate that and invariably it can leave dust behind. maybe that already exists in the app, I just couldn't find it. Is there a feature roadmap that you are comfortable releasing? I would like to continue to use the app and watch for the changes over time. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 05:32:19
what happens when you have 20 or so different accounts with small amounts of btc across them as you use more and more addresses. and one day you want to send all bitcoins you have in the wallet to another person or address. do you pay miner fees across all the addresses in your wallet, or is it one fee for all the addresses because they get combined somehow into a single transaction?

i took a shot at trying to define the fundamental value of bitcoin, it assumes some basic understanding of the technology, however:
Yes, I agree, we are so early into the bitcoin market and the ecosystem has just begun to develop in earnest. We will see so many more companies, ideas and applications on top of the bitcoin protocol that will drive adoption and media interest. The technology is just too compelling to ignore, and one of this issues holding up wider use is the usability of the protocol at this time...

hello, i am playing around with bither and its a really neat app. I like that it is also cross platform. There is one thing that is really annoying, however, and I cannot figure out why this is the case. When you type in the password for BIP38 enabled private keys, there is no space button anywhere on your popup keyboard! I looked for it on the alphabet keyboard and the numbers keyboard and it simply wasn't there as far as I can tell. Many passwords are actually passphrases that involve more than one letter with a space in between, it sounds like a simple enough fix -- pls look into it, I thin folks would find it more usable. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:29:54
Unless I misunderstood you, I'm not sure I agree, tbh, it was built to disrupt industries and fiat currency. So from that perspective, yes, it wasn't built for stability. But bitcoin the currency will eventually stabilize, and this is where the protocol will yield the most dividends. I believe the value of the protocol is optimized with a stable protocol, a stable price, and lots of services and technology built on top of it.

I really enjoyed the research report, quite frankly, and appreciate the level of analysis you put into this. I wish we had more in-depth reports on bitcoin and its implications on social, economic, political and financial aspects. I don't mind if the producers of the rise and rise of bitcoin want to wait for a better release deal. At least the community can collectively learn what the market for such films are at the current stage of bitcoin's journey. Let the free market work itself out. That documentary will not be the first or the last, and bitcoin's ecosystem will continue to grow with or without it. 
Having said that....I still want to watch the video, not really for myself, but because I want some of the skeptics I know to watch it --- perchance they might be persuaded if they see a documentary with higher production values than many of the more amateur videos tend to offer.

I like electrum, mycelium and HD wallets in general. But I keep coming back to paper wallets with BIP38 for a variety of reasons - and espectially for long term cold storage. For one, they can be spent easily with apps like Mycelium, although these wallet developers need to be more consistent on how they treat change addresses to avoid someone inadvertently sending btc to an address they don't know about or control. Ideally, wallet apps in the settings shoudl allow you to decide how to treat change addresses (ie whiuch address to send change, or to send it back to the same address). And there should be reminders along the way in the user interface to make it clear where change address is going. 
With bip38 paper wallets, you can create a bunch and keep them in many locations. alumnium and steel cards are cool, but there is no substitute for storing your paper wallets in multiple physical locations to avoid risks of fire, theft, etc.. and keeping bip38 passphrases in other secure locations.  I also think splitting them into a many paper wallets is the way to go to address spending issues so that you don't expose your btc holdings to the internet - thus preserving cold storage benefits. 
I shoudl say that at present, I only like  bip38 wallets for long term cold storage. I suggest 100% cotton paper for preservation benefits. 
I think as far as business opportunities, we need more paper wallet generators that have nicer designs. bitaddress.org is great in terms of functionality, but let's face it, the design stinks - with or without artwork. I don't know why there aren't more elegantly designed templates that are opensource. 
In the future, I see companies, individuals and maybe even governments adopting paper wallets branded with their own identities for consumers to use, but only with bip38 of course to avoid theft. The design aspects of paper wallets is as of yet a largely untapped business area, in my opinion. I don't like the tri-fold format, but prefer a single note similar to a paper currency note. Most of the designs that are out there now are too cartoonish or playful in my opinion. I hope that changes.

Thx for the suggestion. It says its unconfirmed. So why is the transaction just hanging like that for three days? Does the network reset everything after a few days of unsuccessful attempts? Its very frustrating...first time I have such an issue.  I tried sending more bitcoin out of that address and now it too is hanging without confirmations despite the usual miner fee. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 14:22:30
thx, I sent a detailed response to Rassah via reddit, but will send the email to the one you suggest. I actually think the problem is a glitch in the mycelium app because there are hundreds of confirmation on  and it simply isnt showing up in mycelim, only a message in green saying "Sending xxxxx BTC..." and it simply hangs that way in a way that i cannot spend from that addressd because of that apparent glitch.
i will re-direct the email to developers thx for the suggestion. you guys do great work, I know its tough to someitmes be on the bleeding edge

I like this comment, thx for that. My initial thought on this is that, since most commodities are influenced by weather-related anomolies (ie agricultural goods) or geopolitical considerations (ie oil), other commodities 'should' in fact stabilize when they are integrated in a global economy unless there are significant shocks, exogenous or otherwise, to the entire global economy. Metals are not influenced as much by weather or geopolitics, so maybe my argument suffers there. But to the extent metals are cyclical based on the underlying strength of the industries they feed into, we can say there are cyclical reasons for price volatility. But something (like btc) that is highly defused across every industry on earth, and across every nation - well, that would probably have more stability than other traditional commodities. Or at least it might exhibit longer periods of stability than other commodities. 
I am not sure we will know for sure, I haven't seen empirical evidence to definitively make a conclusion one way or another. There aren't any commodities that have the qualities or potential of bitcoin. 
I will give this some thought. although you may not agree, I will upvote your comment.

@_date: 2014-10-15 05:17:54
Initially, the main factors I see is the need to build out infrastructure: services, apps, usability and so forth. This is needed to consumer and merchant adoption. It is an inevitability, this is already happening. Once critical mass is there, it will not take long for countries to consider using it as a store of reserves alongside gold, commodities and hard currencies. The good news is that once bitcoin takes off sigifnicantly, perhaps initially around clusters of significant bitcoin use/activities, and it becomes a success in one country, others will quickly follow that examle of success. Take a look at Michael Porter's early theories on clusters and national competitiveness. I think there are parallels with the way bitcoin might develop. And the good news is btc is a global phenomenon, so where it takes off in a mass, consumer friendly way is still up in the air as far as i can see. I think there will be a point when people, companies and countries buying into bitcoin when they realize its not going away and will continue to be used as a currency, as a store of value, and as a mode to conduct frictionless transactions in real time across borders for very little fees. The programmable nature of bitcoin means that applications and services we have not even imagined will surface so the actual bitcoin economy in its comprehensiveness is still up for grabs and morphing literally every day. good luck with the paper.

Thx, yes, i agree that Electrum is great. I wish it had a better mobile app for android, that may come later. The only issue I have with electrum is the clunky way of spending offline, using usb drives, etc... and I don't like the fact that if one of the private keys in the addresses it generates are known, for whatever reason - careless or otherwise - it presents vulnerabilities for all the other addresses with a balance in your wallet. At least this is how it was explained to me. I still use electrum for some of my holdings, but also like paper wallets to be honest, for long term storage

Large scale adoption will only happen when bitcoins become more accessible (more ways to buy and sell them), and when the technology is more user friendly. The marketplace should solve both of these problems as more solutions come to play (ATMs, exchanges, peer to peer exchanges, etc) and as more competitors come into the market, and more bitcoin users come online, then fees and prices should come down as well. I agree, this is a problem, it needs the market to solve them. I am encouraged that bitcoin is decentralized and open source, suggesting that when enough people smarter than I think about solutions, they can be implemented as the ecosystem expands. If we don't see light in another six months or so, I will start to worry. ATM machines just barely started to be deployed, and VC-related start up funding has just begun to pour in, relatively speaking, so we will need time for products and services to be developed, tested, deployed and promoted more widely. Adoption of bitcoin by merchants is growing rapidly, users on blockchain or other wallet providers are also growing very fast, so the trends seem to point in the right direction so far. I know its frustrating when we want to see the ecoystem develop even faster.

thanks for your thoughts. I have often wondered why, if there is even a single digit change that bitcoin takes off mainstream, Wall Street firms don't buy even small quantities to hedge their bets. One would think that with all their smart hires an deep pockets, someone would tell them to jump in just a bit. I still don't see them taking the splash, although i sometimes hear snippets of news that leads one to believe they are looking at it. I can't think of a better investment project that one that:
(a) has global interest, 
(b) cannot be undone, 
(c) has inherent value in its usefulness, 
(d) has the potential to revolutionize some of the world's biggest and oldest industries, and 
(e) has tens of thousands of smart and entrepreneurial programmers, activists, startus and organizations across every continent trying to find innovative ways to use, improve and propagate the enormous benefits bitcoin offers to the human race. 
And as you say, to value this global, socio-economic and financial project at 'just' $6 billion, it is absolutely ludicrous. I am encouraged when I read about bitcoin's ecosystem and when you consider so many new ideas, start ups, and exciting complementary technologies over the bitcoin protocol like colored coins and how property and equities can be distributed with far better efficiency in a frictionless environment. I haven't felt this good about a project in my entire lifetime, and I remember the internet before the browser. And that didn't capture my imagination the way this does. Maybe I'm older and more experienced, but everything about bitcoin tells me it's going to either be massively huge, or fade into obscurity and I  sincerely doubt its the latter.

Apple is locked into its own proprietary technology, microsoft sells to lots of PC manufacturers, apple pretty much only to their own hardware. Their world views are too different. They will push their own icoin or whatever they want to call their currency. This is my guestimate. Google had better jump on the bitcoin bandwagon soon if they want to stay relevant. I have written off apple integrating bitcoin, but hope I am wrong..

I would be very surprised if the new ETFs don't result in a signficant upswing. Most folks I introduce bitcoins to ask the next logical question, which is 'where can i get some?' These ETFs will make it much easier to buy and sell them. I think there could be lots of pent up demand to buy bitcoins from everyday people, and the ETFs might be just the vehicle they need to get on-board. And I also think ETFs will bring a whole new level of legitimacy, and once we go this path, it will be increasingly difficult to go back in terms of regulation or implicit endorsement by governments. Because the supply of bitcoins available for sale is still relatively low, the initial launch of bitcoins via ETFs may result in a significant bump up. I hope the ETFs will allow anyone with a Fidelty/Scottrade or similar account buy easily in almost any amount they desire.

Folks, I agree that we need a better slogan that captures the essence of bitcoin. I hate the term digital or virtual currency because almost all fiat currencies are overwhelmingly digital, especially the USD. So it's not exactly a distinguishing feature. The fact that bitcoin is programmable money and offers far more flexibility and a frictionless, secure environment for online and e-commerce applications is definitely a major benefit, but that's different then saying its digital or virtual.
The slogans I recall seeing before, and which I actually like are:
(1) In numbers we trust:  
I like this because it brings about TRANSPARENCY and truth, which is a stark contrast to fiat currencies that constantly tax citizens via inflation and loss of purchasing power. This slogan shifts trust from fiat currencies to bitcion, the only viable alternative currency that isn't controlled by governments, corporations, politics or regulators that are ultimately influenced by special interest groups. 
(2) The world's local currency:
This was suggested on this thread, I do like it. It implies that bitcoin is a global standard, a hard currency so to speak, and yet accessible in the most remote regions of the world. It's also a powerful statement. 
I think the community can come up with many ideas for a slogan. But I think it is equally important to make sure we consistently display the same slogan everywhere so it sinks in. 
Branding is only effective when it's consistent, truthful, distinctive and relevant to the broader public.

my thanks to you all. I just read that chromebooks will soon allow android apps to work on their OS, they expect this later in 2014. That woudl be great, since I also heard an android app version of electrum is in development. so a decent cold storage solution might be possible with chromebooks using an android electrum app offline. 
I prefer using electrum to paper wallets because if anything happens to the hardware, the wallet can be regenerated with the seed, but if something happens to the paper wallet, it's a bit more difficult to recover them without a seed-like feature.
