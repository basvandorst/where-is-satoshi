I can't pay more on an existing transaction can I?  I just have to wait it out?

I've been waiting almost 24 hours.  I sent a transaction from a wallet and accepted the default fee.

Are you guys kidding me?  I've been waiting for 24 hours.  I sent another one about an hour ago and upped the fee to 25 cents and its still not confirmed.  Stop with the bullshit and let people know whats going on.

Blockchain wallet to localbitcoin account.  Maybe the issue is with blockchain.

16 hours?  really?  crap.  I just asked this question in another thread.  Where can you see how many transactions are queed up?
@_date: 2015-07-06 23:57:15

Is there an easy way to move my wallet to a different online wallet?
