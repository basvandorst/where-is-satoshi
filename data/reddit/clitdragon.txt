I didn't quite remember correctly.  It turns out, their main website *was* hacked due to a security vulnerability, and at around the same time they had an Argentinian website hacked because their login was "admin" / "password".

Cameras, alarms, and dogs are the way to go.  If a loud alarm is going off, the place is flashing red (just for psychological effect), they *know* the police are already on their way, and there's two dogs...  They're not going to feel super comfortable sticking around, and they're probably not going to hurt your family or even your dogs.
If they still stuck around at that point, I'd take the hint that they're bad motherfuckers and probably just give them what they want and hope the police can get it back for me.

It's a transaction.  The explicit policy is that your transactions aren't exempt unless the government explicitly tells you they're exempt.  
You're also wrong if you think you're just "switching protocols", because each protocol has a limited number of coins and you're acquiring control over those coins.

Let me just rearrange this for you: 
10 @ $1  
5 @ $2    
1 @ $10    
1 @ $10  
Your average coin costs: $2.22
Average cost of the coins at the times you made transactions: $5.75
Oh, the averages are the same.  What do you know, it's not a valid counterexample to the statement I made. 


If you were disagreeing with me, you meant average costs.  Otherwise, your comment was inane and irrelevant, and there's no point in responding.

When they say "processing the transaction", that probably means fulfilling the order that didn't get automatically filled in by the system.  They're deciding whether to give the money back or send him his shit is the meaning of that sentence. 
If you were to interpret it in the way that you did, they'd be claiming that they're literally working on the block-chain.  Absolutely silly.
If we wanted to further conferm though, you know what would be nice... **The god damn transaction id.**

It doesn't count as a sale, but the message they sent specifically says that sends count towards the $20k, and not only buys and sells.  If the total value of the coins you bought is over $20k according to their value at the time of purchase, or you sold $20k, sent $20k, or received $20k, you have:

After he became absurdly belligerent when asked for a transaction ID, and then deleted his comments when pushed even further, it's pretty clear that he's a bullshitter.  
I have no idea whether to believe you or not, because I could probably fake that screenshot in under a minute.  It's not really evidence of anything to me, but I don't have any reason to believe you're lying either.

I mean, it's a screenshot of you sending someone messages, and them responding, with the transaction ids wiped for no apparent reason, so...  
But anyways, it looks like it's an issue with your travel site having a transaction expiration time that isn't always working out.  That's actually enough information to let me know that it's not something that should make me worried about coinbase, which would have been a great thing to mention from the beginning.

It's pretty clear that you're wrong and you should think about it because the claim I made is trivial to prove.  If you really believe I'm wrong about this, try to come up with one counter example.  I promise you can't.

I think you missed the point, partially because you're only thinking about the part of the issue that centers around you.   He's asking you to help the community by being transparent so that everyone else can see whether or not there is a problem with coinbase that we should be worried about.   Sorry that helping the community doesn't do anything for you personally.  I would have hoped that wasn't your only concern.  Since it's obvious helping the community understand what's going on wasn't even part your intent, I'm surprised you posted on a public forum instead of sending him a PM in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:54:21
They want to know whether or not you're telling the truth, presumably because it's easy for you to show some evidence (the transaction ID) without revealing any personal information and it has implications regarding whether the community should hold off on sending money out of coinbase until it seems like the problem is resolved.

They said they treat it like property, and when you swap property it's always been considered a taxable transaction. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:59:24
The coins do exist, just not in the limited and naive way that you think about existence.  You are performing transactions, because in order to get coins on another protocol you have to agree with a trade.  You can't trade any amount of bitcoin for another cryptocurrency that you don't own without agreeing to a trade at market prices, and the value of cryptocurrencies relative to each other is not constant; it's not even a little bit similar to trading 10 $10s for 1 $100.  It's also not considered a like kind exchange, and you absolutely are required to pay capital gains on exchanges between different cryptocurrencies.
It obviously doesn't matter whether the coins are forked from the same protocols or not.  You can't directly trade one for another without performing a transaction. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:32:02
We already know one person was telling the truth, but the other person is claiming there is another, separate issue that they're unwilling to share any details about.  There's a difference between "here's this specific problem and an example transaction id where you can see that it occurred," and "there was definitely a problem, but I refuse to provide any technical details or a transaction ID and I'm further going to assert that there's no way a transaction ID could even be useful for showing a problem in a thread where the main post shows a transaction ID used for exactly that." 
If you don't understand why the original post is clearly not bullshit, but the guy I'm replying to is likely full of shit (or was, before they deleted their comments), then *you* should recalibrate *your* bullshit meter.  You really don't even find it a little fishy that he wouldn't post something as easy as a transaction ID?

Nobody gives a shit about your little toy account, we want to know what the problem was so we have a better idea of whether or not it's safe for the grown ups  to continue trading on coinbase.

What's the exact misunderstanding that you think they have?  Calling bitcoin "bitcoin core" expresses ignorance of the difference between the protocol and the client software.  "BCash" and "BTrash" have always been terms that people use to refer to a protocol (although, you may interpret them as being unnecessarily derogatory).

It did work fine, the merchant got the money.  They just have to do some things manually for 1 of his 3 orders since one of the callbacks timed out, unless they want to refund him and let him try again, which I can understand is a mild annoyance but isn't a huge problem if it doesn't usually happen. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:18:10
Even that's more work than I'd expect someone to do just to lie on the internet... finding an item that was worth the right number of bitcoins at the right time to put in a screenshot?  Not likely.  Also, risking all of that work being for nothing when they're not sure what I'm looking for in the transaction?  Probably, most bullshitters wouldn't bother with any of that.

I think he said they're processing a refund.  It might of been in one of the comments he deleted because he's a bullshitter.
In his case, it sounds like the merchant got the money.  That means the payment system worked.

Assumption 2 is about market value. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:22:18
Assumption 1 is incorrect, Bitcoin has value simply *because people are competing to buy it*.  People can compete to buy it for whatever reason they choose; although as technology enthusiasts we'd like it to be be because of it's use as a currency, it also gains value if people are competing to buy it because they believe they can make money by doing so.

It's not like the bug is going to be "they copied the bitcoin address you typed in wrong".  Of course there's a potential that looking at the transaction would reveal something fishy about it.  
But what's more revealing is that you won't provide any (non-personal) information because you're a fucking bullshitter.  Having a bullshit meter on the internet is not the same thing as having trust issues, buddy.

So when you make further claims/deductions about the value based on these assumptions, you should be more clear which value you are talking about in which claim in order to make it more clear whether or not the claims actually conflict. 
For example (if I'm not mistaken), your first deduction is referencing intrinsic value but your second one is referring to it and reasoning in ways that make more sense if the first was talking about market value.

@_date: 2018-02-02 02:33:42
Yeah, dollar cost averaging means you spend the same amount of money each time you buy.  The effect is that you buy more of the cryptocurrency when it's value is lower, and the average cost of your cryptocurrency is less than or equal to the average cost of the cryptocurrency at the time of the transactions, e.g. 
1   @ $10    
5   @ $2    
10 @ $1    
1   @ $10 
Your average coin costs: $2.22
Average cost of the coins at the times you made transactions: $5.75

It's correct.  The exact term used is "statistical impossibility".  It essentially means the probability of the described event is so incredibly low that anybody who wants to talk about it should be laughed at and shamed.  It makes a lot of sense.  If we translated the term "impossibility" to mean "can't happen" in the sense that you'd propose, we couldn't use probabilities to to describe impossibility because even events with a probability of zero can happen.  E.g.  If you choose a purely random real number between 0 and 1, any given number has a probability of zero that you're going to choose it (because there are an infinite number of choices), but you're still going to choose one of them. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:01:38
