ELI5: People will "work" to attain something until the cost of the work matches the expected reward. If the expected reward is large, people will work very hard. They just won't necessarily be doing the kind of work you expect them to do. 
PoS is one in a long string of ways of obscuring the work process so that the *designers* cannot see where the work goes. Ever more convoluted methods are tried, to hide the work method that is visible and turn it invisible (stake grinding, bribing, etc.), so that it for a time looks like a solution. 
In the end there is no free lunch. All roads lead to proof of work, and from a security standpoint it is much better to know the nature of the work being performed rather than having it hidden for a clever attacker to discover first.

It's the idea that altcoins are pointless, since there is only need for one cryptoledger. Since the Bitcoin ledger can be copied infinitely without any inflation, there is really no need for alternative ledgers. They could all use copies of the same ledger as they split off. It's a kind of silly made-up term by people who don't get this and/or are envious of early adopters. 
Ironically, the ETC/ETH split proves this point, since they are both copies of the Ethereum ledger. The existence of the split and no loss of holder purchasing power while the two chains are now independent is exactly why altcoins (altledgers!) are superfluous.

The term centrally planned is usually used to mean one predesignated body determines the plan unilaterally. Therefore, by "centrally planned," parent presumably meant that there has been no market vote to choose among various discount rates in SegWit. Bitcoin is and will always be the product of *some* combination of person's or group's plans, but that does not mean it is the product of any predesignated person or group's plans. 
Bitcoin may have to choose a SegWit discount that correspponds with someone's plan; that isn't central planning in the common parlance. Central planning would be if there were one body that handed down the discount rate and no one could oppose them. This is not the situation in Bitcoin generally, since exchanges could easily open fork arbitrage for any such controversial choice to let the market decide, but neither is it the case that "Bitcoin is centrally planned" in any usual sense that term is used. I thus take parent's point to be that the market will start offering alternative SegWit discounts if SegWit becomes a thing.


A free market means there are multiple competing (yes, mutually incompatible) implementations to choose from and that the bitcoins in the ledger copies run by them can be bought and sold independently. That way the most market-supported level of SegWit discount (75%, 50%, etc.) would be converged on. It might end up matching Core's plan or not. It would certainly match *someone's* plan but again that is not at all what is implied by "centrally planned."

Because altcoin developments are sometimes relevant to bitcoiners, and even when they aren't, it is often worth discussion to explain why they aren't so as to allay concerns some people would continue to have if such discussions weren't allowed at all. For example, I think PoS is total bullshit and is irrelevant to Bitcoin, but it should be discussed if it gets upvoted because that indicates plenty of people haven't heard or yet understood the arguments for why it is bullshit so we as a community will have to deal with it sooner or later (or risk people selling their BTC for shiny PoS coin nonsense).
EDIT: Then again, many here seem to be of the mindset that allowing discussion on something is tantamount to agreeing with it or allowing it to be promoted (I hope my example above shows that it's equally about allowing it to be smashed down...but only if the opposition is allowed to bring their A game without risk). I'm perpetually puzzled at how such people manage to hold such a view while participating in online discussions for years.
@_date: 2016-04-13 06:21:50
Bitcoin would survive just fine with 1MB. But why would anyone use it when there are carbon copies (even using the same ledger!) that simply don't have that handicap? It's a definite handicap unless you make the much stronger assumption that 1MB (or less) just happens to be the optimum limit. Baking in a handicap while compensating with other tricks doesn't address scaling, because anyone is free in open source to copy the tricks and not copy the handicap. Scaling is fundamentally about competition. Scaling as compared to what?
@_date: 2016-08-14 19:51:23
The logical endpoint of your reasoning is that Bitcoin should be controlled by a single team with no possibility of competition from other teams that might have different views on how to best achieve scaling goals. Why are people celebrating this kind of centralization?
@_date: 2016-04-18 08:59:31
In 2012 the vision was to take over banking, yes, but it was seen as a major long shot. The idea that banks would ever even talk about Bitcoin at all, let alone assemble teams discussing it, let alone build their own blockchains, was quite pie in the sky back then. Now it is palpable.
Sure, a dev team can go off the rails but Bitcoin has always been that way. No one (I hope) invested in 2013 based on how incorruptible the then-current Core devs seemed, so why would their perception today hold any more sway? The idea was always that Bitcoin forks away from any such interference via market procresses, and that such interference is inevitable if we are destined for trillion-dollar market caps. 
I am partial to Gavin over others but I would have never invested if I thought he had any special ability to tie Bitcoin to a specific vision. Likewise, I see no reason to refrain from investing just because people I am less partial to hapoen to be in control of the currently dominant implementation. If they fail, they get forked, just like if Gavin had failed or been gotten to. If this forking doesn't happen upon a team going off the rails, cryptocurrency in general is a dead end.

In the face of competition, you don't get to *focus* your planning on the worst case scenarios - because some other coin (or fork) will take just a smidge of risk and very likely wipe the floor with you. Scaling means scaling competitively. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 06:33:59
What good do all the scaling tricks in the world do when a competitor can just copy all those tricks and just *not* copy the 1MB base limit? 
Scaling in a vacuum is meaningless. It's like saying, "Our chili is going to win the cookoff because we have the greatest recipe and the best recipe design team. Sure, we have to add a cup of chlorine to every batch because oir head chefs insist on it for sanitation purposes, but we have so many flavor-enhancement tricks that we can overcome that strong chlorine taste and still win." Of course to make the analogy right the recipe must be open source, so anyone can copy it. Well then what happens when a competitor less obsessed about sanitation copies the recipe without the chlorine?
Scaling is fundamentally about outcompeting what any easy fork of your open source project can do. Bake in a timebomb and you simply cannot compete. **Scaling means scaling competitively.**

Yup. I call myself a Gavin supporter, but I would sell all my BTC tomorrow if I thought Gavin would be in charge of Bitcoin. That is why I am not so worried about any perceived "takeover" of Bitcoin, whether by Core or Classic; it can't be taken over. 
The market supported ETH for a while on the belief that Ethereum could somehow avoid centralized governance issues better by...centralizing governance. Nope. The principle of market governance either works or it doesn't. If anyone could really take over Bitcoin, it wouldn't matter if the person or group in power was my favorite guy or not - it would mean I was wrong and crypto is just not a workable concept.

It is not unlimited. You're falling into the fallacy of thinking that just because there is no hardcoded limit there is no limit at all. The system is governed by economic constraints, not just code constraints. This is why it is apparently so hard for pure engineers to recognize. They think that unless they themselves add in something to limit blocksize, blocks will just get arbitrarily large (a commons). 
If only there were a mechanism by which network resources could - dynamically and situationally based on the tradeoffs of each individual miner and node - determine what size blocks are likely to gain traction in the network. Oh wait, there is. Orphaning.

"General agreement." OK, so what have we learned? What percentage of *whom* constitutes general agreement?

This is supposed to be a key selling point of Core: "no benevolent dictators" or at least "our benevolent dictator requires consensus for all changes." Well if there is no definition or it can be reinterpreted at will, this selling point is merely a facade.

@_date: 2015-12-30 17:46:43
It makes me think you don't understand something when you keep saying "difficulty" and not "hashing power." Difficulty is merely set to follow hashing power, so that is the value that matters for security. If it were only difficulty you want raised, just fork to change the difficulty function a bit higher. That won't really aid security.
Charitably, perhaps you mean "effective hashing power" (total hashing power less orphan rate) and you're just using "difficulty" as a proxy term for that?
@_date: 2015-12-23 13:59:43
Mainstream adoption implies a price about 1000 times higher than now, which is roughly ten doublings, or 40 years (the year 2055). That's way too far out to be basing today's decisions on.
@_date: 2015-12-17 08:09:13
This isn't really right: even small block adherents like Gregory Maxwell have said that a large part of the reason to keep blocksize small is to incentivize other optimizations first. That means we're effectively holding back a lot of capacity we could add on in a pinch, even if you believe the small block view is correct and also believe that alternative scaling will be slow in coming. 
Strategic considerations like that may be important but they shouldn't be allowed to obscure the big picture by fooling people into thinking Bitcoin is actually stuck at such low TPS with no recourse in the event of a major mainstream adoption event. Bitcoin can certainly say "damn the torpedoes" if the stakes are high enough.

Most of the whole debate is about whether that thing you just asserted is true or not.
@_date: 2015-12-19 04:06:49
The argument has been pointed out informally numerous times on various forums and subreddits, and discussed formally in u/Peter__R's paper. People have typically countered that the upping the cap is a code change, so it is less conservative than keeping the cap. 
The resulting debate presents us with two competing forms of conservatism: conservatism with regard to changes in the code vs. conservatism with regard to changes in the economics the code results in. Both of these could be called changes to the "social contract" of Bitcoin, with some people saying the code should never change (Mircea Popescu, for example) and others saying the blocksize cap was intended and generally expected to be raised. Hence some want to say, "I signed up for Bitcoin as the protocol stands, including the 1MB cap," while others want to say, "I signed up for the vision of a Bitcoin that understood the cap is only temporary." Still others say the cap isn't properly understood as part of the consensus layer of the protocol, but part of the transport layer. 
Unsurprisingly, it is usually code-focused engineers who offer this objection, with those more conversant in economics tending to take the other side.

Hmm, seems that wouldn't be a 51% attack (everyone's hashpower remains the same as before), just a lean block attack taking advantage of fast blocks because of low difficulty. 
But for that to happen I'd imagine the diff would have be incredibly low, plus it adjusts every ~2 weeks so it would have to be from a sudden large change in effective hashpower (total hashpower less orphan rate), which shouldn't happen unless the orphan rate changes suddenly. So it sounds like an argument against raising the max blocksize *suddenly*.
Maybe I'm wrong?
@_date: 2015-12-25 20:18:28
I like the idea of letting the market decide, but I think non-mining nodes are a strange thing in Bitcoin, and probably can't really be relied on very much for consensus matters until there is more of an economic cost to Sybil attack.
Forks (and spinoffs) themselves provide the purest market decision mechanism, so I think that is the ultimate answer, and much cleaner than dealing with the brokenness of the existence of non-mining nodes (something Satoshi never intended).

@_date: 2015-12-27 11:44:13
So what? Miners are professionals; they lose money if they get forked off so they have every incentive to ensure they do not change any protocol settings before it is viable to do so and maintain consensus. Nodes worth their salt in protecting the network also need to understand what they're doing. 
Core cannot be everyone's nanny forever, but *even if you think it should* there is nothing stopping Core from setting strongly recommended defaults and/or guidance about when to adjust settings. It's the same as now when Core recommends a new release to download, except without the inconvenience of downloading.
If trivial inconvenience were the only thing holding Bitcoin together, the project would already be dead. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 16:26:43
Thanks for a clear discussion.
You've made two convincing points: 
1. Bigger blocks amplify the "high-hashrate miners have fewer orphans" effect.
2. Bigger blocks amplify the "well-connected miners can drive poorly-connected miners off the network" effect. 
As a consequence, if we start with 5 miners each having 20% of the hashrate and equal connectivity, any miner who pulls ahead in either hashrate or connectivity will have an increasing advantage in profitability so that they can keep increasing both hashrate and connectivity until they have a monopoly.*
The problem is these two points counteract each other. 
Unless cheap electricity and good connectivity happen to be concentrated in the same geographical areas, the two effects are not additive as you implied, but in fact subtractive. Increasing or decreasing the *relative* advantage of good connectivity over cheap power changes who the winners and losers are. Tip the scale more toward connectivity being relevant and you favor miners in certain geographic areas; tip the scale more toward power costs being relevant and you favor miners in certain other geographic areas (like China). 
Therefore what matters is not the *absolute* level of advantage a miner who is well connected has over one who isn't, nor the absolute level of advantage a miner with access to cheap power has over one without it. What matters is the relative difference between those two advantages. The ideal is for them to be as balanced as possible.
For example, suppose - under 1MB blocks - a miner with one standard deviation better connectivity than the competition has 10% higher profitability and a miner with one standard deviation cheaper power than the competition has 20% higher profitability, and that these figures are 40% and 60% under 10MB blocks. Then the relative advantage under big blocks would be *less*, not more, reducing an already-present disparity instead of increasing it, thereby *improving* decentralization by spreading out mining power geographically.
Now the situation could easily be the reverse, but the point is we don't know. To find out, we have to measure the relative effects. We cannot start with the assumption that small blocks have a better relative balance of these two factors when the exact opposite may be true: it may well be that small blocks are what is centralizing mining in China. 
The situation in China suggests that connectivity already has far too little weight relative to power cost - that is, a Chinese miner can take the "hashrate road toward monopoly" with very little competition from miners elsewhere who have great connectivity. The Chinese miners have already told us they don't want to go above 8MB because of the Great Firewall, meaning they think they would lose money. 
Assuming they said this because they have crunched the numbers for their own businesses, which is likely, this is evidence that bigger blocks would have a strongly *de*centralizing effect by taming the relative influence China's power-cost edge has over other countries' connectivity edge.
*Note, for completeness of the argument, that economic rationality implies they would not go too near 50%, lest the BTC price fall as people get afraid. If a pool, the price effect is lower since the situation is less worrisome as hashers can just leave; if a single miner, the price effect is bigger since the situation is more worrisome, but the price effect is far more painful for a single miner as all the capital is theirs, so they would likely keep a safer distance from 50%.
EDIT: Not to mention that there are diminishing returns in network connectivity and dis-economies of scale eventually occur for large mining companies, both working to keep the two factors from getting too out of balance even if it were the case that bigger blocks tend to unbalance these forces (in the range of blocksize before reaching network limits as Peter R described).

Interesting. I'll think about this more, though there seem to be workarounds such as soft caps. With a 20MB cap, say, I think miners would creep their soft caps up slowly and ignore the longest chain if it were over the cap. There are clients working on implementing this logic automatically, which may or may not work.


Diminishing returns apply, though, especially in Internet. And that doesn't defeat the canceling out; it just mitigates it somewhat - or loops back into the point above.


Agreed.

Also social. Core is famously unfriendly to outsiders, at least those with certain views. We don't hear from those people because, well, for the most part they left. Unsurprisingly, they didn't enjoy having their contributions rebuffed.
And note this is not a criticism of Core. I expect other implementations will be the same way. It's an inevitable consequence of having one "reference" implementation. This creates the illusory mythos that there are only these super cypherpunk wizards who could ever program Bitcoin.

Nevertheless, a factor that pushes toward monopolization is not the same as Maxwell's original point that the fees are "wasted." **It does NOT make it take any fewer resources to get to 51% of *effective* hashing power.** It merely means, as you say, getting from 20% to 50% may be slipperier - but that is the same for all miners. The two claims are separate.


No, the effective hashing power *is* the total hashing power less wasted work. That's the definition. It's already taking the wasted work into account, so it can't be lowered by it.

How is it balanced to say that *changes* can only be made with consensus whereas the current state of the code needs no consensus to keep as is? 
It's like being in a bus where we have consensus of passengers to cross some train tracks, then while we're on the tracks some guy says, "Hold it, I don't consent to moving off the tracks," so the drivers stay on the tracks deliberating in the name of conservatism and balance.

That may be, but by bolding it it seems like you're trying to say it doubles as a claim that fees are lost. The arguments are separate. Orphans may increase centralization, but they do not constitute a cost to the system *absent that effect*.
It's important to keep these straight, otherwise if the centralization argument turns out to be false or defendable against, the fee argument it would have supported falls, too. The two claims must be shown independently.


Again it seems the *effective* hashing rate remains the same, which doesn't damage security.


So can the other miners. In fact they can collect the juicy fees (remember the fees are huge at this time because of negligible block reward) that the attacker is leaving on the table. Looks like the attacker is making it rain!

Difficulty is just the setting of how hard the mining problem is. Higher difficulty is not security itself unless the hashing power of the network rises commensurately. If it doesn't, all that happens is blocks are mined slower for 2+ weeks. That's not an increase in security. 
As far as I understand, it's not difficulty that increases security (that's just a lagging indicator), it's total hashing power. A given orphan rate will make network-set difficulty somewhat lower than it otherwise would have been because it slows blockfinding, yes, but it doesn't reduce total hashing power (obviously; an orphaned block doesn't blow up your mining equipment! and if someone will say it reduces miner revenue so there is less equipment being bought with the profits, that's also false because as you said *total* miner revenue is unchanged; as intuition would suggest, it's strictly an individual concern). 
If all Greg Maxwell was worried about is difficulty being too low because of orphans, anyway, why not just survey the orphan rate and increase the difficulty adjuster function to compensate? But that would be pointless as the whole point of difficulty is to force more hashpower, and orphans would already be doing that.

It's a myth that the community must unite. 
1) When there is a mere majority and the incentives *at the time* are great enough, a fork happens and everyone goes along with the majority because of the overwhelming economic incentive to do so. And even if this weren't the case...
2) Irrresolvably contentious hard fork events INCREASE value in Bitcoin, because the threat of a contentious hard fork is the market demanding a split. You still have all your coins in both, so wealth is unaffected, except that the market got what it wanted so the total combined price is higher and you are richer.
However, I very much doubt a split will happen over this, as the economic threshold for that is extremely high. Maybe during a war at some larger blocksize cap it could, but it will be a good thing if it does.

Of course they couldn't. The precedent that investors get shafted every time there's an upgrade to the protocol would be a horrible and irrational one. That's why altcoins are pointless.* If altcoiners cared about innovation, they'd try to get their innovations into Bitcoin, and if they were rebuffed they should release their own implementation with the changes included and try to get people to adopt it. 
Bitcoin is it. The [monetary network effects]( in the ledger are far too strong for anything to compete. That horse left the stable years ago.

Fair enough, though I'd call that a controversy. 
I personally don't care if Core follows a consensus model, but if Core is marketed as following a consensus model and some changes are refused using that justification, it doesn't look good to switch to a mere majority model on an ad hoc basis. If Wlad is really just going to take everyone's input and make the final decision himself, he shouldn't demur to calling himself a benevolent dictator.

There is no consensus on this statement, since Jeff Garzik (for one) disagrees.


I completely agree with this, and Wlad can do whatever he wants with his project. However:
1) He is trying to say that it is run by consensus, presumably to gain or maintain user trust, but this seems increasingly questionable and could undermine user trust. 
2) Anyone should feel free to fork his project, and it would be odd to call that an "attack on Bitcoin," as some have.
@_date: 2015-12-29 08:37:56




I agree. 
However, this is no reason that this peer review process has to be centralized in Core's repo. That's the whole point of improvement proposal. Miners and nodes can take Core's *recommendations* into consideration without being bound by a wall of inconvenience (self-modification of the code). Since a lot of miners already mod their code today, it is clear that all Core really does with respect to consensus parameters is *set Schelling points*^1 for consensus to form around. 
The inconvenience/casual-user-difficulty of modding the code does strengthen the Schelling point, but it has the disadvantage of centralizing control over Schelling-point setting - thus introducing friction and a potential attack vector into the consensus process.
- Core sets the Schelling points for consensus parameters (max_blocksize=1MB, etc.) *as user-unchangeable settings*
- Miners and nodes are able to mod their code to change those parameters if they wish (maybe need to hire a coder), but of course they generally don't as they would lose money/functionality due to not tracking consensus
- Miners/nodes *could* all agree to a block where they change the parameters in sync, irrespective of Core, but it would be inconvenient (instructions for doing it would have to be circulated, etc.)
With this BIP:
- Core sets the Schelling points for consensus parameters (max_blocksize=1MB, etc.) as *default settings* with alternatives selectable (with warnings)
- Miners and nodes can *easily* change those parameters if they wish (don't need to hire a coder), but of course they generally don't as they would lose money/functionality due to not tracking consensus
- Miners/nodes *could* all agree to a block where they change the parameters in sync, irrespective of Core, and it wouldn't be inconvenient (except just getting everyone on board and aware, which is the same problem faced when Core would release a hardforked upgrade)
Note that all these changes are "merely" changes in convenience. I put that in quotes to be fair, because even trivial inconveniences can make a [big difference]( in how people act. However, taking a stand against the spirit of this BIP is to fall back to the position that **Bitcoin's consensus is enforced by a wall of inconvenience.** 
If that's the position you want to take, matters just got a lot worse for you: there are now implementations (and yes, they are properly called *implementations* as they don't force the user to break consensus) that already have this BIP partially included and are working on having it fully included, meaning that wall of inconvenience is about to get a whole lot thinner. With respect to blocksize it already has.
A few days ago, in order for a miner/node running Core to adjust the blocksize cap, they had to mod the code themselves and recompile, or hire a C++ programmer familiar with Bitcoin to do it for them. Today, they can simply download a piece of software. Maybe tomorrow they'll be able to just download some kind of tiny plug-in someone makes.
Thus we see that the wall of inconvenience cannot be relied on. As is argued in the case of zero-conf transactions, "We might as well break it now because it's trivially defeatable." **It is inevitable that Core's recommended consensus parameters will become unbundled from the rest of its code offerings**, not because centralized control over the consensus parameters is bad (though I'd argue it is), but because the inconvenience barrier cannot be maintained. 
We are only now seeing this unbundling because it is only now that a sizable number of Bitcoin users have started to have a different opinion from Core and/or become wary of vesting inordinate power to set these Schelling points with a single group in a single repo. Core's recommendations will still carry tremendous weight in people's decisions about how to set their consensus parameters, but the process will no longer be centralized. People will go with Core's parameters if they want, or converge on one of the Core dev's proposals, or maybe someone else's. 
Consensus will happen, not because it is enforced by a barrier of inconvenience in Core software, but because there is overwhelming economic incentive to converge on consensus parameters. To confuse this is to imagine that the tail is wagging the dog. 
Moreover, the consensus will be economically rational and value-maximizing because miners and nodes are economically rational, which is a fundamental assumption for Bitcoin to work in the first place.

Investors put millions of dollars into Bitcoin every single day. Investors looking to maximize their returns in the Bitcoin space have several options:

- buy stake in a startup (venture capital)
For two straight years, those daily millions have been flowing into mining and venture capital, not the price. If mining is topping out (likely) and venture capital is topping out (apparent), where do those millions flow? I'll give you one guess.

This assumes that Core's 1MB limit creates certainty. Mining pools are perfectly capable of modding the Core code themselves to produce bigger/accept bigger blocks. The 1MB limit merely serves as a Schelling point -  if miners like it, they keep it; if they don't, they're able to change it or pay a coder to change it. This situation is identical to the situation with BU, except that BU makes it more convenient to change. Whether this is good or bad is not clear, but mere inconvenience seems a weak reed to lean on to maintain consensus. I conclude that consensus comes from the overwhelming incentive to stay in consensus, not from Core's 1MB cap - other than in that it serves as a Schelling point.


This isn't correct. BU allows miners to limit what they accept, and in fact does so by default. It simply makes "modding" the blocksize parameters easier (no need to hire a coder to do it for you), which may or may not be a good thing.

Not sure if point really is true. 
The point of high hashing power is to guard against 51% attacks. If a miner gets a block orphaned, it's because someone else found a block faster (ingoring network speed). But that is us looking *after the fact*. Before the fact, statistically their work still gives them a chance of finding a block, which logically MUST take away from a would-be attacker's chance of finding a block. That is extra security.
The error is to equivocate between the omniscient view (after the fact) and the human view (cannot know who will win the block race before the fact, only have probabilities).

Virtual reality porn and cybersex is a good bet, but the larger point is we cannot know but there's a relentless drive for faster, better, lighter, denser, cheaper - and that drive enables new ideas not yet conceived of, which drives more and more. Why stream in 1080p when you can have 8K constantly? It will be demanded from every home security camera feed because the greater detail saves lives, etc. You can always justify more bandwidth. The USA telco oligopoly and highly spread out geography is creating a skewed view for US residents I think. In East Asia the speed wars are continuing through to 100GB up/down for sub-$50 prices already, even though it hardly makes sense for anything but streaming extreme HD video in multiple feeds at once.

No compromise is necessary on non-monetary parameters. Consensus for the network protocol is self-reinforcing and based on market forces. We just haven't had those market forces take effect yet because we are (rightfully) concerned about planning in advance.

21M coins and 100m satoshis per coin is just a labeling system coupled with a non-arbitrary precision related to resource use. 10 minute block time isn't arbitrary, it's a point that has to be set somewhere; blocksize doesn't. Same with 2 week diff adjustment. 4 year halving period is a critically important number determining rate of inflation based on estimated adoption rates and other things. 50BTC start is either subsumed under the previous point or just a label. 90 min time fork rule isn't arbitrary, it arguably has to be set somewhere. Same with coinbase, though I might buy that's sort of arbitrary. 
Blocksize is the only factor I'd call arbitrary in the sense of trying to override the base economics of the system that would otherwise emerge based on actual network conditions.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:01:46


Bigger blocks require optimizations as well, so by that logic keeping the blocksize cap small is already slowing that type of scaling development (optimizations to enable larger blocks safely are scaling development, too!). Why favor one or the other?

Whatever you may call it, this is how it already is now except that users have to "vote"* on features in a lump, rather than granularly. Neither is more consensus-preserving that the other, but the BIP takes some power away from Core for setting those consensus Schelling points.

Great point. Specialization and division of labor in Bitcoin will increasingly be a thing, just like in the larger economy. Various functions now consolidated under Core will be left to the market as  mining consortiums and other infrastructure businesses and stakeholders come to their own consensus, perhaps with the aid of prediction markets, fork arbitrage, and such. At some point (maybe today) it will be impossible to grow otherwise.
@_date: 2015-12-22 01:54:36
The monetary network effects are in the ledger, not the protocol. However, you don't even need sidechains to resolve such disputes. There are spinoffs, and well as fork arbitrage on exchanges, to accomplish the same thing prediction-market style.

Because users are robots who cannot decide for themselves what is in their best interests for staying in consensus? Even if you think so, any users for which that is true would stick with the defaults as recommended by Core.

If all that is true, where was the widespread outcry to stop Bitcoin scaling up to 1MB? Why does that outcry coincidentally get heard and acted upon right as we approach 1MB? (an arbitrary number) 
Not only does this presume that 1MB was coincidentally in the right ballpark, the resistance to even a raise to 2MB or 4MB presumes the even bigger coincidence that 1MB was almost exactly right. Talk about a hole in one, Satoshi!

It's the Core maintainer's claim that "consensus is required for all changes," so he should inform us of what he means by that. If the word is so malleable that he can in fact pick and choose what changes to merge by suitably twisting the meaning of the word as is convenient, it starts to look like a term of salesmanship - especially if used to contrast Core with other implementations that are tut-tutted for being run by "benevolent dictators."

I realize it can be hard to see how emergent consensus would word (though arguably it already does), but one thing should be fairly obvious: the alternative is to vest Core dev with absolute power to determine "whose settings take priority in the network spanning tree that is bitcoin." That is a centralized process of decision-by-committee, no matter how many people sit on that committee.  If that were really a necessity, Bitcoin wouldn't be capable of being fully decentralized. With a modular approach, Core guidance can be issued anyway, and people can follow it if they truly think that is the only way to maintain consensus.

More telling is this part of Pieter's post:


Sure, he might have "learned more" about blocksize and decided we need a lower cap, but this statement here makes it obvious that we big blockers aren't delusional in recalling that the general expectation was that the limit would be raised (in fact he's even saying it would be outright removed!). I have seen people try to say that Satoshi's comments didn't really indicate 1MB was intended to be temporary, like they're trying to build up a case that somehow the basic social compact was for 1MB to be permanent. Well, Pieter for one clearly thought that was nonsense.
@_date: 2015-12-16 18:32:58
It'd be sophistry to claim otherwise. In fact I'm not even aware of a Core dev who claims otherwise. For example, Greg Maxwell seems very clear in stating that Satoshi had it wrong and low blocksize caps are actually essential to Bitcoin's functioning and thus we need to change the economics to have a low cap rather than a high sanity-check cap. It is fine to claim such a thing is needed and that original policy intentions can be wrong, but to say it is less conservative (meaning less of a change from original policy) to raise the cap is absurd.

Yeah that's what I meant by non-mining nodes being a strange thing.
WIth node ratifying, doesn't it just become a game of which implementation can find the fastest path through the collection of nodes accepting its blocks? It's unclear to me how that would work out, because any nodes that were slow or topologically near the edges of the network graph would have very little say, whereas nodes at pinchpoints near the oceans like New York, LA, Tokyo, etc. with low latency and high speed would matter a lot. Correct?
It seems like as long as each implementation has plenty of nodes in support of it, the race would come down to some minor factors affecting top speed and highest connectivity, a bit like with high-frequency trading on Wall Street where the game becomes to get your connection to the main hubs as fast as possible.

[2] would be terrible, but [1] would be almost nothing. I read Paul Sztorc mostly for his economic awareness, so this is a pretty big letdown. 
"Doubling of the money supply" is meaningless when *everyone's* money is doubled. What matters is the percentage of the ledger you own. If you started out owning 1 BTC out of today's 15M coins, you end up owning 2 BTC out of 30M coins, but you still have 1/15M of the ledger. Your purchasing power is unchanged, even though the price per coin has halved. It's the same as if we suddenly declared there are 24 inches in a foot and each inch is half as long as before. It doesn't mean you get any taller despite being double the number of inches. (It does mean you have to change some wall charts, etc. but that is a far cry from "terrible non-Bitcoin-ness".)
To achieve any clarity of thought, one must first disambiguate between "Bitcoin the ledger"  (including the coin release schedule) and "Bitcoin the protocol that currently maintains that ledger."
@_date: 2015-12-29 06:21:23
It doesn't speak well of the mindset of the operators. In Bitcoin, and especially in the fully anonymous quarters, reputation is everything.

There's an easy solution if we want to see if a split is necessary (and thereby effect the split if it is). Just do a spinoff of the Bitcoin ledger, so that there is one copy of the ledger being maintained by a protocol that has a 1MB cap (Core as it now stands) and one copy of the ledger being maintained by a protocol that has a high cap but is otherwise identical. 
Then anyone who wants to support a small or big cap can sell their coins in the other copy of the ledger to get more coins in their favored copy of the ledger. If the price of coins in one if the ledgers doesn't immediately fall to near zero, we'll have a nice peaceful split. Anyone who wants to remain neutral and not make a bet on the winner would just end up with equal coins in both ledgers and however the prices apportion (0-100, 80-20, 50-50, etc.) their purchasing power remains the same as before. In the case of a split, if big caps later resulted in catastrophe it doesn't hurt anyone besides those who sold their small-cap coins. Conversely, if small caps resulted in the small cap ledger getting outcompeted and withering away, it doesn't hurt anyone besides those who sold their big-cap coins. (Also, any payment recipient wanting to remain neutral would have to demand payment in both ledgers, but wallets could automate this process to avoid undue user confusion.)
This seems completely amicable and clean, as well as risk-free in all scenarios as long as the technical aspects of the spinoff are done right. Then we wouldn't have to have this debate anymore. Investors could bet on the winner and/or the relative market valuations of the two ledgers, while everyone else could enjoy the benefits of whichever version is superior without the downsides of the inferior version (or the benefits of both if it turns out they both have useful use cases).
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:24:25
If you think that, there's nothing you could do to stop it anyway. But in reality, the hard money community would just fork the mainstreamers off, and they'd have coins in both resulting ledgers so they'd get rich quick off the mainstream ledger even if it eventually fizzled. Meanwhile the hard money ledger let's them get rich slow as people finally come around.

Orphaned blocks merely redistribute the fees among the miners. 
Perhaps he means work is wasted, lowering the effective hashpower. That is true, but everyone is on an equal footing there: they all waste work, including any attacking trying to gather 51% of the *effective* hashpower so the security is no lower. 
Perhaps he means the attacker could mine lean blocks non-cooperatively? What does that do? I still don't see how an attacker gains an *advantage* over other miners. 
**No matter the orphan rate, the total resources required to gain 51% of the *effective* hashing power (total hashing power less orphan rate) remains the same.** Therefore security is unaffected by orphan rate, unless that orphan rate varies a lot around the network (so the centralization argument may hold, but the fee argument simply cannot - the fees don't vaporize!).

Technological unemployment is frickin' awesome if you understand the very first thing about economics. This is a reliable litmus test to sort out those who don't know what they are talking about in economic matters. It's quite simple: when nothing needs doing, you want for nothing. It is paradise. If there were people who needed something done that couldn't or wouldn't be done by robots, bam! there's a job opening. If someone was living in anything less than pure luxury and no robot could fix this lack, bam! job opening. Jobs are a sign of relative lack, a sign that stuff still needs doing because some human need is still unmet. Elimination of all jobs only happens when all human needs are completely met in terms of everything a human could possibly do for another human.

You said many words all with the assumption that 1MB just happened to be the proper limit above which an increase starts to be some kind of non-scaling, which just asserts the debate away. It assumes that 1MB just happened to be the magic number for determining the line past which transactions cannot remain "free"/cheap. Just because transactions will cost *something* (due to eventually running into the *economic* blocksize cap) in no way implies that that cost has to be non-negligible for most users. That's like saying liquid nitrogen must be "warm" from a human's point of view because it's well above zero degrees Kelvin.

Probably a lot of people wouldn't. Decentralized reputation systems are fundamentally anarchy-promoting: the reason people couldn't get away with operating tax-free very easily now is that there's no way to ensure the reputation of someone who isn't government licensed and isn't registered with some legit service. 
With decentralized reputation, drivers can build a rep and be sought out without the passengers knowing or caring whether they are legit in the legal sense (because they know they are legit for safety and service through the rep system, even more than many "legit" taxi drivers are). If their passenger is an IRS agent or something, they might have a problem, but then there might be pooled reputation to get around that as well. Like the driver would have good rep but you couldn't tell how many times they've actually been hired so they might try to evade a sting by the taxman by reporting some income but not all. 
Of course once you have decentralized rep working solidly, that opens up oracles, which open up decentralized prediction markets, which open up decentralized insurance, which is extremely anarchy-promoting since people will start to offer things like "state insurance." For example an insurance policy that pays out $100K for every 6 months spent in state custody, covers IRS fines, etc. With the risk of getting caught mitigated like that, a lot more people will be doing it - for better or worse.
The future is going to be wild.

The counterpoint is that the market always manages to surprise with innovations. Moreover, many of these innovations are already seen, and in fact Blockstream and Core are relying on untested innovations of their own. Larger blocks themselves create incentive for innovation.

He sarcastic message is actually right but he doesn't realize it. 
The market should (and does) decide the coinbase reward: it always chooses to follow the original Satoshi schedule. The market is perfectly capable of choosing constancy in cases where constancy is needed. There is no need for central planning. The miners aren't just going to go, "Durr-yup! Increase the coinbase reward to 30BTC! Inflation good! The market will love that!" 
Any economically irrational miners that tried that would be rejected by nodes and other miners, and in the extreme off-chance they succeeded, investors would just fork to a copy of the ledger without the extra coinbase transactions (thankfully they aren't spendable for 100 blocks, so there is time to catch the attack...of course, if you were worried about miners doing this you may as well be worried about a 51% attack, as both are game theoretically infeasible due to miners being econo-rational).

@_date: 2015-12-22 11:23:25
Core now enjoys a measure of clout and default trust merely based on its having access to the historical Satoshi repository. Peter is merely proposing that no implementation should have that clout, and that all should have to compete on an equal playing field. 
Core supporters trap themselves if they argue against this, because they implicitly argue that Core needs this special Satoshi-conferred anointment to continue its dominance. To go further and call it "sabotage" implies Core is *especially* weak and really needs that artificial prop as a matter of life and death - not a position I'd want to argue if I were a Core supporter.  If you believe Core is the superior implementation, you shouldn't be afraid to eliminate Core's crutch of being tied to the historical repo and let it win on its own merits. May the best implementation prevail!
EDIT because some are confused: Peter isn't saying another team (his team, Gavin's team, etc.) should have access to that crutch instead; he's saying no one should. This really should have been done a long time ago, the moment there was any controversy over which implementation is better. As theymos said earlier today, "Core is not Bitcoin." There's no reason to stack the deck in its favor anymore, it's a big boy and should he able to stand on its own two feet.

In a code sense this is true, but in an economic sense the self-preserving organism is the ledger and its method of maintaining its own viability and integrity.

It does, but not necessarily in a set direction, because the ordering is based on the score (insidious when mods ad hoc switch the ordering scheme to suit the party line). I'd guess that with scores hidden:

2) Voters voting blind will change voting patterns in complex ways. (No controlling a comment at exactly 1 or exactly -4, for instance.)

Incorrect. Time value of money is a thing. 
To prove this, consider that there is no way to know if coins are being hodled or have been burned until they are moved. Someone might think they have the private key, but in fact they lost it and those coins are effectively burned. It can't be known until after the fact. That whole time you are saying those coins were NOT contributing to other holders if they were merely being held, but WERE contributing to them if they had been burned. That's a real Schrodinger's cat situation.
Another way to look at it: what if you hodled for 100 years instead of burning? Who alive today will ever know the difference.
What hodling actually is is a loan of purchasing power to every other hodler, not a straight donation. Hodling does boost the price versus selling, and higher prices incentivize myriad changes and developments in the ecosystem. This should be as clear as day from looking at Bitcoin's history (along with its price history).
Spend and replenish is, however, even better. You are correct there, but incorrect that "mere" hodling is unhelpful.

Decentralization is absolutely necessary, but there is a point where you reach diminishing returns and it actually becomes counterproductive because you're holding down a system that could have evolved further out of government reach if allowed to grow faster.

It's disingenuous to argue that "due diligence" would reveal to a user that the code is unlikely to change, as if that is a cut-and-dried matter of fact.

To keep Bitcoin safe from altcoin competition requires us to be *sure* that the blocksize cap is pretty well as high as it can safely be. That's a very high bar, much higher than "well we need to proceed with caution and do more testing before increasing beyond 1MB." For all we know, 100MB may be fine. 100x capacity could all slosh over to an altcoin while Bitcoin pounds sand. Premature optimization by a bunch of science nerds calculating wind resistance and such while the other teams strap on an extra rocket booster and zoom past us.

I agree with you, unless I'm missing something. After all, it's not like the Core devs are excellent economists. I never see them make economic points of even the level of subtlety you raised here. All experience has show that people who don't have special training or practice with economic reasoning will fall into these traps over and over. In a system as economics-heavy as Bitcoin it would be far more surprising if they *didn't.* Hence we should be wary of, nay, *expect* errors like this to pop up all the time.

Lean and efficient is nice, but it should be noted that this isn't even necessarily the optimal way forward when all factors are taken into account. It could be that a brute force huge block version of Bitcoin that doesn't cater to the lowest common denominator of technology (and really, how low do you wanna go; there's no clean cutoff), then later coming around for everyone once advanced countries and areas have matured the tech, is actually the fastest way to bring the promise of Bitcoin to developing nations. Such a pattern is not without 
precedent. 
And this is even true for decentralization. It could be that big blocks are the only thing that will allow Bitcoin to grow big enough, fast enough to become "too big to ban" in the eyes of governments. A decentralization that doesn't do what it's supposed to do (guard against attack!) is a Pyrrhic victory.
@_date: 2015-12-06 00:24:49
It is in many cases, but for the bitcoin miner component of course the price can't come down nearly that much (neither for the Pi, since it's already priced as a production model). The price should quickly approach the cost for the miner+Pi, though, which is presumably a lot cheaper than $400.
@_date: 2015-12-19 04:32:55
It breaks the deadlock and sets precedent. If we fork once, it becomes easier to fork again. It also keeps the blocksize greater than Q* for the time being, so that it continues to function as a safeguard against attack (if you believe in that) rather than as a central-banking-style policy tool for shaping economic behavior in new, untried ways.

Right, so "Bitcoin" or "altcoin" is a label one can only apply to a proposed change *after* the community has rejected it, not before. Even a change the community rejected at one time could be adopted at a later date. Thus there are no changes that - while remaining mere proposals - can be called altcoins. And of course, as has been repeated many times, if we are not allowed to discuss a proposal, there is no way to reach consensus on whether to accept it, *nor any way to even say there was a valid consensus on rejecting it.*
Freedom of discussion is absolute prerequisite for any claims of consensus *or nonconsensus.* Any intentional limiting of discussion must therefore be seen as fundamentally against the consensus process.
@_date: 2015-12-28 11:22:41


You've misunderstood. Unlike XT, BU doesn't force miners to accept any blocksize they don't want to accept. Miners can choose the acceptance blocksize themselves. This may or may not work, but it's incorrect to say BU is an amplification of XT's one-size-fits-all forcing of larger block acceptance.
@_date: 2015-12-27 12:25:34


How does that sound? This idea that people wouldn't come to consensus on their own even though there is incredibly strong incentive to do so is just bizarre. But if you are that worried, Core can always issue "official settings" in signed announcements, and also make those settings the default in modularized proposal (with a bunch of scary warnings before the user is allowed to change any consensus settings). Anyone who wants to be told what to do by Core is still free to do so and would be doing so by default.
@_date: 2015-12-02 20:24:41
And he is basically right: as Paul Sztorc notes in his article linked ITT, people will always work until marginal revenue equals marginal expenditure. In English, that means "work" will always rise to meet the reward (in Bitcoin's case the block reward). Thus proof of work is the purest, ultimate final form of consensus. 
Anything else (including PoS, TaPoS, and increasingly Byzantine workarounds for the nothing-at-stake problem) is just a roundabout way of doing the same thing, which is bad from a security perspective because you make it harder for everyone to see how to up the work, leaving attackers with a potential advantage if they can outsmart everyone else. Simple SHA256 hashing is close to perfection. Only something innate to humans could be an improvement.

So the vast majority agreed that consensus isn't required on a particular change. But Wlad said consensus is required for every change. It sounds like he meant that agreement of a vast majority is required for every change, rather than a consensus. I'd then recommend marketing Core as "vast majority driven" rather than "consensus driven." It'd be a lot less confusing.
@_date: 2015-12-05 04:45:13
I didn't suggest otherwise. We're all conflicted financially in this space (except Blockstream of course ;-P), but it is useful to know in which direction.
@_date: 2015-12-22 10:55:46
It looks that way at first glance only because we are used to Core having default moral authority as the "official" implementation. If we hold to the principle that, as theymos just said, "Core is not Bitcoin," there no justification for Core having a privileged position drawing from the reputational clout of sitting in the historical Satoshi repository. Core should have to compete for users like every other implementation does. In fact one could even argue that it should be handicapped due to its inertia bonus, but whatever the case surely no one can argue it should be artificially propped up. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:34:41
It's just consolidation. If you look at the chart, there was some extra consolidation to do after the big run-up since October, since it didn't do much retracement. Bitcoin appears to be retesting the low 400s to set up for the jump past 500.

You end up having to balance three factors if Maxwell is right: blocksize cap, block reward, and incentive to move off-chain. 
- If Maxwell is correct and caps need to be low (or inflation raised) to keep funding security, then altcoins* will pick up the slack from spenders (or holders, if inflation is raised)
- If Maxwell is incorrect, then caps can be high, block reward can be untouched, and altcoins will rot
*actually spinoffs, I think, but that's another argument

Ever ask kids if they want to use the bathroom before a 4-hour drive to Disneyland? They'll tell you a hundred times "NO," and they refuse to agree to an itinerary that includes a detour for that. Then what inevitably happens? The pain builds and builds, and they eventually beg to take that detour.

These are a class of uses of transactions that can freeride off the excess security in the blockchain. It's not a bad thing, but it does limit how many such assets can be backed before the hashing power becomes too low to justify backing any additional assets. (Unlike BTC price rises, more assets secured by the blockchain doesn't directly incentivize more mining.)

Note that a 50/50 weighting of BTC to LTC is actually making a 10x bigger bet on Litecoin's success than Bitcoin's. If you want to be equally rich whether Litecoin succeeds or Bitcoin succeeds, you would have to put 90% into BTC and 10% into LTC. Do the math with the market caps and you'll see this is true, because LTC market cap is about one-tenth that of BTC.

I think he is just making the point that there is no way to refute hypotheses like "the community already decided on BIP101" when users were never given a real choice because - although implementations running it exist - talk of this has been carefully censored. He is saying that if Core is so sure of their moral authority they should give users the choice within the software client. That way they can always be sure the community is with them. Then and only then can we validly say BIP101 was rejected.

It's not "by the people," it's "by the investors."

Yup. The idea of changing the inflation schedule is abhorrent to everyone now, including me, but we are looking at Bitcoin before it has already taken over the world. When it has taken over the world, a *very tiny* amount of continuing inflation that is *100% market-controlled* would probably not find much objection from people if it were necessary for some hugely important reason (such as that Bitcoin would we otherwise broken).
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:38:33
Sure, but that also means we cannot say at what point "just raising the limit" becomes "scaling without scalability." 


The same was true at 100 kilobytes, so by this logic it must have been reckless to allow soft caps to increase to 1MB.
@_date: 2015-12-29 09:37:13
Yeah, this is very different from "consensus" (before the fact) on changes. I would say that Core has co-opted Satoshi's term, which meant *after-the-fact* consensus, to add false authoritative oomph to their claims that their decision-making process is a good way of running a repo.

No, difficulty does drive price: 
BTC wanters can obtain coins by either mining or buying. High diff (relative to rig cost) pushes them toward buy and away from mine, low diff does the opposite. Only buying affects price.

Even if it's 6 months to complete obsolescense, which it isn't (and will be less and less so as mining advancements slow toward something like Moore's law) that is simplistic. You're assuming miners enter the business then promptly leave, without regard to property expenses, power supply equipment, ancillary computing equipment, massive air conditioning equipment and engineering, personnel contracts, training, etc. There are a lot of sunk costs besides just the mining units.

Purse.io has such a counterintuitive business plan, but it does work. It takes advantage of weird regulatory inefficiencies in the market because of government interventions.

Purse.io just connects the two, so the buyer saves big on regulatory arbitrage and the gift card guy in India or wherever gets less screwed by US money regulations than they otherwise would have. Everybody wins.

It would develop naturally as we reach the actual *economic* blocksize limit determined by profit and loss of miners and nodes run by businesses, based on network resource costs and the tradeoffs of each individual stakeholder rather than the arbitrary centrally planned blocksize limit attempting to divine the tradeoffs from an ivory tower.

If mining power isn't concentrated anywhere specific on the globe, it becomes impossible to be close to everyone, so no particular group or geographic area has an advantage, other than perhaps high population density areas. 
If China is out due to the Great Firewall, that seems like business costs in action. Tailoring Bitcoin to China would weaken Bitcoin by giving the Chinese government inordinate power, so I don't see why it's viewed as taboo to tell China their position of prominence in mining might be temporary.

He's right, and that is why there need to be multiple competing private software projects as options for users to choose as ledger-updating protocols for the Bitcoin ledger. That way, if users want a change they don't have to hope and pray that one person or group changes their private software project for them. 
Then if a change is controversial among devs but not among users, users can move to the client offered by the devs they agree with.

It cuts both ways: "If we keep blocks small, no one will work on on-chain propagation solutions IBLT, weak blocks, etc."
Why the innate bias for off-chain optimization? They both need to happen, but right now the 1MB is artificially tipping the scale in favor of off-chain optimizations. Why favor one over the other?

The Core devs are expert coders, but Bitcoin is about a lot more than code. Even Gregory Maxwell agreed that Bitcoin is highly interdisciplinary. Whatever they aren't experts in, especially economics, they should be humble enough to consider outside opinions on. This isn't a moral injunction, it's advice on how to remain relevant. The market is smarter than any one person or team, and it will take into account *all* experts, not just the coders at Core. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:57:04
Meh. Bitcoin reacts only when it must; it's the nature of the beast. Wake me up when there are complaints about high fees and backlog all over the net and plastered on the front page in the subreddits *and* the Core devs and miners and node operators are mostly like, "Everything is fine. Let them leave." Someone will budge before then, guaranteed. For Core's sake they should be the ones, but if not they won't be around too much longer.

*Economic* majority. There is no "vote," only buy and sell. You can complain if people sell your side of the fork, but I don't know what good it will do. There is no means of avoiding this through fancy governance models or polemics or roadmaps or conferences. When rubber hits road, Bitcoin is always about market valuation. The fork just enables the market to give more than a binary answer of "YES I like what you're doing" and "NO I don't like what you're doing." The fork enables the market to say, "I like Bitcoin, but I like THIS version better than THAT one."

But you haven't made an argument. You merely made an assertion that everyone loses. 
Why don't you go actually ask some ETH holders what happened to their bottom line when Ethereum split? They will be happy to tell you they made bank off selling their ETC.

You mean *buy*. A fork is the time when the market expresses its will. The market will get its wish during a fork, so it should be happy and rally afterward. 
Note that this applies even if the market is wrong, so it's not a small or large blockist position, nor a pro-/anti-Core position. It's merely an investor observation. Forks only happen because the market was upset with how things were going. The fork actually happening resolves that.

Market vote. 
Even if you think the market shouldn't be able to vote (better known as buy and sell), the fact of the matter is it does. Without the market's vote of buying, Bitcoin would never have been more than a curiosity. If there is a fork, the market can determine the relative price of coins in each (assuming PoW change, of course), thereby choosing which one is economically relevant. 
You seem to not want to call it "Bitcoin" if it changes something you personally see as crucial. No problem, don't personally call it Bitcoin. The market cap can be 100x your favored version and share Bitcoin's ledger history; still no obligation to call it Bitcoin. I won't complain. Peaceful resolution.

There has been way too much crying wolf on both sides. Alarmism has been allowed to become a megaphone for one's views. Higher fees won't immediately kill anything; they just gradually enable altcoins to encroach if not addressed in time.

That people are starting to have issues, but that it is still manageable at these fee levels, if suboptimal. Backlog dynamics are spiky and partly random due to variance in blockfinding times, though, so it is a deadweight loss on the system no matter how smoothly it is managed.
This means that the sky is not yet falling due to high fees and backlogs, but it also is not benign. We should expect some pressure to increase capacity, but not yet overwhelming pressure.

The reason the 21M coin limit will not be changed is NOT because of the sagacity of some devs, nor is it because it was "set in stone" by Satoshi. It is because the market likes it. Investors would obviously not support change that makes Bitcoin no longer hard money. They rally around 21M because it is a solid Schelling point set by Satoshi, but that shouldn't obfuscate that it is really the market that is in control here.
And while it's *technically* correct (the best kind of correct) that both the coin limit and the blocksize limit are both just constants in the code, their relevance to the market is like night and day. You may respond that the market will guard the blocksize limit just as fiercely, knowing that without it the system is insecure and Bitcoin cannot be called hard money. But notice that this is *assuming what you meant to prove.* It's a perfectly circular argument.

@_date: 2016-01-12 00:14:53
Indeed, decentralization is a complex thing. More complex still is the reason we want decentralization: to make Bitcoin harder to slow, push underground, or shut down. One of the best ways to defend against that is to grow bigger faster than governments can keep up, becoming too valuable and too intertwined with the economy (tax revenue stream) to shut down. That requires more throughput. So it is by no means cut and dried that bigger blocks = more centralization, or easier to attack. In fact, it is quite plausible that keeping blocks small is overwhelmingly worse on balance for achieving the actual benefits we want from decentralization. 
We should keep in mind that if a Bitcoin2 with 20MB blocks, for example, is at all viable, someone could release that and it could quickly take over a bigger community than Bitcoin now has (of course assuming the Bitcoin doesn't react, which I think it would). Then what would Bitcoin be? An oversecured system that failed due to intense overconservatism.
It's like in the drivers' ed manual where it points out that sometimes accelerating is the best way to avoid danger. The catch-all heuristic just to stop or slow down isn't the safest action in all situations. In the same way, keeping blocks much smaller than than they need to be just opens up a large attack surface for a competitor. If ideal blocksize for overall invulnerability to attack is N megabytes, that leaves N-1 megabytes of attack surface for an altcoin to eat Bitcoin's lunch.
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:21:39
Economics has everything to do with most of the arguments in the debate. Decentralization is the big one, and that definitely involves economics, incentives, real-world business and government considerations, etc. Things we wouldn't expect a coder to have any special knack for. We really should stop expecting coders to play a role they aren't equipped for. It's dangerous for Bitcoin and not fair to the coders either, as it brings a lot of needless flak on them. The blocksize limit should be left for the market to decide.

"Technical" meaning CS and crypto. Rest easy there: most people aren't taking Core or its proposals to task for their coding style or cryptographic approach.

They may. I very much doubt most of them would, but if they feel strongly enough about the difference between and 1MB and 2MB, that's their prerogative - just as much as it's the community's prerogative to insist on the change.

If this is meant to cover economics, surely a prerequisite for being considered an expert would be to actually sometimes at least make some economic arguments and points instead of calling them "off-topic" and "non-technical."

If this is Mike and not just normal volatility or Cryptsy coins being sold, I'm sure it will bounce back quickly. It was in a fragile technical pattern, so it was looking for an excuse for a little tumble. I really recommend investors not get spooked by short-term movements in Bitcoin, nor try to peg them on various developments. Take a look at the [historical chart]( and note how utterly tiny a 10% move is historically.

That is circular reasoning. You start by assuming Bitcoin can't scale past 1MB by blocksize cap increases, then conclude through a semantic flourish that Bitcoin can't scale by blocksize cap increases. That paints 1MB as a magic number. It could be that that number is really 10MB or 100MB, only after which do we need the things you mentioned to scale further. Drawing a line in the sand at 1MB is entirely circular. You have to actually show what it is about 1MB *in particular* that makes it the exact point at which further optimizations are needed for a cap increase to count as scaling, because otherwise you could make the same argument if the cap were 10 kilobytes. (You could also avoid straining incredulity by explaining the extreme coincidence that 1MB turned out to be this magic number.)

This is just bizarre. 


This is the economy saying "fuck you" to the disfavored fork. What could be more decentralized than that? I mean, if exchanges are so powerful that they could set the price of the forks so as to selectively "squeeze out" one of them, why don't they just set the BTC price to $10,000 per coin and unload their stash? Cohen is either incoherently handwaving here or is ignorant of the basics of market pricing and market-making.
@_date: 2016-01-09 21:40:56
One thing is clear: however good of a bet Bitcoin is, the difficulty in understanding it is discounting the price by *a lot* So every time you think Bitcoin is hard to understand, a hassle to get set up with, and risky to deal with, realize all that all the hours you spend understanding it, going through that hassle, and being careful to avoid risks may be the highest paid hours of your life.
This is a pretty motivating way to get people into Bitcoin if they are stuck in the wage mindset, rather than the investor's mindset, as most people are.
@_date: 2016-01-29 05:03:36
It's not urgent yet. The market (*economic* majority) often prefers to wait as long as there is still time to gather more input. If we are at full blocks and fees are skyrocketing and there is a huge backlog and the price is tumbling and then the fork still doesn't happen then you would have a point.

@_date: 2016-01-07 20:05:32
I agree with the main thrust, nothing can destroy Bitcoin, but the final point is wrong: moving to an altcoin would *itself* be an ownership problem. Any problem people have with the current parties that own Bitcoin or its wealth distribution will grin and bear it because of the immense power of monetary network effects and the refining effects of a mature ledger encoding [immeasurably valuable information]( accumulated over the years of prices ups and downs concentrating capital in the hands of those best suited to use it for productive activity in the community and away from those who would squander it. Starting with a new ledger destroys all that. Might have been possible in 2011. Not in 2016.
Moreover, the market likes hard money. The market would not support shifting of ledgers every time a new technology came around, as that would force investors to always be on their toes; exactly the thing they hope to avoid, especially the casual user. Since you can just copy the ledger, though, it is completely pointless. The waning but not yet extinguished interest in altcoins is a testament to the leftover money sloshing around in Bitcoin from the last bubble (not a coincidence that the altcoin craze started in 2013).

What people aren't realizing is that the "change" is symmetrical. As Garzik said, standing still is as much of a change as going with the historical flow. 
Or even if you don't buy that, consider that if an economic majority of 60% adamantly want a change and 40% oppose it just as adamantly, anything that can be said about shafting the minority applies equally to shafting the majority. Except of course that shafting the majority is even worse. Unless one side is more adamant than the other, shafting the 75% is four times as shafty as  shafting the 25%. Of course no one is really shafted since they can fork away (but the market has no obligation to support that fork).

Storzc makes the bizarre argument here that people won't be able to verify the code for themselves. Of course almost no one has the will nor ability to do that now, so it just sounds like convenient FUDdy handwaving taking advantage of the fact that most people haven't considered how pervasive that situation is - and must be. Bitcoin absolutely does NOT guarantee the average user perfect knowledge of, well, anything really. There is always some reliance on the community to vet things at some point in the chain.
As a result, he gets it 100% backwards. Development is *centralized unless we hard fork*. Hard forks are the only way for the market to express its will freely. Everything else restricts the options to Core, Core, and Core. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 07:47:59
Note the hashing algo MUST be changed in the minority side of the fork for this to work. Compatibility will be like any two altcoins, even though these are spinoffs not altcoins - as they share the same ledger, at least at first.
Historical BTC are automatically held in both forks. Investors are unaffected. Only those that take sides stand to gain or lose, though since this would be the market responding to latent desire for a split, the total value held by you as an investor should be significantly higher than it is now. It would be an awesome result, because we could end the bickering and reach much higher market caps (even if one is much smaller than the other, or even zero; the combined total will be much higher).

Good point but it's a losing battle to play into the majority equivocation (economic majority when it's on our side, democratic majority mob rule when it's on the other team's side).

A security model that relies on the user not changing settings that are ultimately easy to change is a broken security model. One should assume that everything that can be offered to the user as an option for how their node software will behave will be available to them at the click of a button. 
With that in mind, it is easier to see how Bitcoin works and why Core, in keeping a setting that has grown controversial locked down in a way that they hope will prevent the user from changing it and by warning people off of any implementations that unlock that setting, is unwittingly proposing a new security model for Bitcoin, based on trying to make it difficult for the user to go against the settings the team wants them to run. This new security model has no whitepaper and is prima facie a centralized security model insofar as it is supposed to be effective, as without the "you're stuck with us" aspect of Core being dominant, their can be no real incentive to prevent the user from unlocking the controversial settings themselves (or with the help of other dev teams).
I hope that makes it clear that letting users set the issuance schedule in their own software would be both pointless and harmless (as long as the user was ensured to understand what they were doing).

I believe that's incorrect regarding Feathercoin, but let's suppose it were true. The most useful phrasing would be the following: Feathercoin would not be considered an altcoin by Litecoin holders except for new investors since the fork (and maybe also those who sold their Feathercoin stake). 
Likewise, any fork of Bitcoin will not be an altcoin from current holders' perspectives, since it won't restart the ledger; it (the combined ledger) is the very same ledger from current holders' perspectives. New investors, who can choose which side of the fork to invest in, will view them as different coins, or altcoins with respect to each other, but that is irrelevant for everyone here in this debate today.

It's understandable from a technical perspective, but it would amount to giving up on Bitcoin entirely if contentious hard forks could somehow be forbidden (which of course they can't), since that damns Bitcoin to eternal stagnation as there are always plenty of objectors to any meaningful change.

@_date: 2016-01-29 07:34:21
It's really not a big deal as long as the minority changes the hashing algorithm, as of course they would. No one loses any stake in either side of the fork unless they specifically sell, and nothing particularly bad happens. 
In fact, if there really is such a latent desire for a split then it will prpbably be mutually profitable as each side will be more comfortable with the result (remember that here the minority considered it *worth it* to tough it out at a very low market cap until the market "sees the light" - or else they wouldn't have split and would have just sucked it up and gone with the majority).
Since the minority side would probably not see much use in commerce the supporters of that side would probably still use the majority coin in commerce while they hodl their coins in the minority side waiting for redemption in a few months or years when the majority coin stumbles. If they guess right, they can win big. However, if it's years the community might have grown a lot and just spinoff from the new state of the majority ledger, so this is best done when the consequence of going with the majority is thought to be swift catastrophe. Obviously few people think that in this case, so they will likely just go along.
Anyone who sleeps through this whole process is unaffected no matter the winner, as they have coins equally in both by default.
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:28:27

It's not "some majority," it's the market. If the market doesn't support it, it won't happen. If the market does support it, it will happen. There was never any way of avoiding the fact of market control over Bitcoin, certainly not by some group of devs trying to box people in. If that's your plan, you're in the wrong business. Bitcoin is a creature of the market, for better or worse, not some devs' pet engineering project.

I understand the sentiment, but what this seems to amount to is a fear that the market - empowered to voice itself during a controversial hard fork - would have a different view. That would be an odd position to take, even assuming having Greg in charge is ideal, because it would imply that once the market inevitably asserts itself he would no longer be in charge. Is the idea that the market can be held at bay somehow? 
Obviously it can for a while, and seems to be now, but I think that's more a function of there being too little urgency for the market to decide it *has* to assert itself yet. Of course you can always fork into the minority with changed PoW if the market moves against you, but I assume that's not what you had in mind.
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:29:23


Sure, I agree with this. It's just that there's no reason to expect expert coders to also be experts at this. A few of them may happen to have some expertise in that area, but Core by no means has a monopoly on such talent - if they have any sizable amount of it at all. That's why continual reference to "the experts" rings quite hollow.

If a 22M chain gets 75% hashpower, Bitcoin is broken.

Essentially Bitcoin is no longer a thing if that happens. It means we give up and start at the drawing board again. 
Continuing with a minority chain would get you 51% attacked into oblivion. Changing the PoW is the only option, but even then Bitcoin's future is called into extreme question as, again, the fundamental assumption is shown to be untrue at least some of the time.

Unanimous support by which developers? Certainly not the Core committers, as Andresen and Garzik are the very ones leading Classic. Everyone else working on Core is a self-selected group not too put off by Core's tactics so far, so it is unsurprising that they would sign on. It's survivorship bias, not any kind of consensus of experts. 
See, this whole schtick is circular: you (supposedly) have near unanimous support from the Core devs, and because support is unanimous you can say that Core is Bitcoin, and therefore you have unanimous support from the Bitcoin devs. Semantic games are the last resort of a dying regime. Every dev who didn't support Core has left, is leaving, or never joined Core in the first place so we don't see their names around here much.

Your last two sentences contradict each other. Economic majority strongly matters in the issue of whether the whole community (95% or whatever) will agree to go along with the fork after it happens...unless you really think more than 5% of people will be just fine using a coin with vastly lower market cap over a change as small as 1MB to 2MB, especially when no almost no merchants are accepting it since almost no one else does, etc. Network effects are a bitch. 
Now maybe by "agreeing to a switch" you actually meant "preferring a switch to happen." In that case, though, that is patently *not* what a hard fork is. A hard fork is just a hard fork. People go along with the economic majority, or in some extreme cases a few would go with the economic minority. Preferring the change is about as relevant as preferring a pony. Bitcoin was always dependent on the market to support it. Nothing can change that, certainly not a fork. A fork just lets the market choose which version it likes better. 
If the market doesn't prefer your change, you can tough it out at altcoin-level market caps until the market "sees the light."

Aethereum would also be Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is the ledger, not the protocol. If we identify Bitcoin with the protocol, there is no way to ever change it and only the very first release can be properly called "Bitcoin" (and it died, since it had the infinite coin bug, so that's done). 
Bitcoin is not just some github repo; it's an economic system. That makes the ledger all-important. Any ledger duplicate, at least at the time of duplication, merely lets Bitcoin investors optionally have a certain percentage of the ledger by purchasing power (i.e., the relative value of coins in the ledger and its duplicate on the market) be maintained by a different protocol (with identical inflation schedule). This is exactly the same, economically speaking, as a normal hard fork to Bitcoin. If Aethereum sucked, the market would devalue that ledger duplicate and we would be right back to how things were. If it were superior, the market would devalue the other ledger, and we'd be right back to how things were except we'd have a superior protocol and therefore would all be more wealthy. If both protocols had merit, the market would value the ledgers proportionally, and we'd be right back to how things were except that we could draw on the merits of both and would therefore all be more wealthy.
The idea that the protocol is what matters, rather than the keypair-based ledger + inflation schedule, is a fantastical notion that could only arise from the most narrow focus on code while completely ignoring economics and real world implications.

This is wrong twice over. As many have pointed out, tyranny of the minority is certainly no better than tyranny of the majority...but we are talking about *economic* majority here, not democratic majority. In other words we are talking about the market. 
To demonize the market as the "majority" (implying mob rule) shows that Adam either doesn't understand or doesn't trust the market. If he doesn't understand even something this basic he cannot be called any kind of expert on Bitcoin generally even though he is on cryptography, and if he doesn't trust the market he's in the wrong ecosystem because Bitcoin is entirely dependent on the market to give it value. Without the market's favor, Bitcoin would be just an interesting science project that never caught on.

None of your first five paragraphs point to a specific 1MB blocksize cap. In fact it would be a fantastic coincidence if 1MB was even in the *ballpark* of the point where it becomes unreasonable to scale up any more by blocksize cap increases.


Starting from 1MB or around there? Why 1MB? The foregoing is all misdirection if your real answer is going to be about specifics of why 1MB or thereabouts is the point where we must do something more complicated and therefore risky.


Nice wordplay on "layers." It almost fits the idea of a smart contract while being a just-slightly odd word choice. Don't tell me this is subtly setting up the sneak-in of *TPS scaling* layers.


...almost there... 


...and shazam, the old switcheroo is complete. What you really meant by "layers" was scaling layers. You had to introduce this in the context of smart contracting to get the reader on board with the idea that yes, smart contracting "layers" were intended from the beginning. Now comes the subtle shift to scaling layers, a *reliance* on which Bitcoin was certainly *not* designed for from the beginning. At least certainly not at 1MB.


Or they would be if people would stop calling forks "attacks." On the one hand say you want competition, but on the other many in Core seem to dismiss every attempt at such competition as sabotage, and the idea of letting the market decide controversial points as dangerous. (As if the market deciding could ever be avoided!)


Back to this again? Still meaningless without showing why 1MB or anywhere in that ballpark is the point where we start to experience these tradeoffs, whereas we didn't at, say, 50kB. 
Some Core developers are fond of saying that "practically everyone agrees the blocksize must be raised eventually." Likewise, practically everyone agrees that layers will likely eventually be needed to maximize TPS. This post was a lot of words that amount to little without the argument for why 1MB is close to magical (and for that matter why 2MB is so dangerous that vesting Core with centralized control over development is preferable). 
What have we learned? That at some point layers will be preferable to blocksize cap scaling, and that somehow this justifies painting the former as in general some kind of NASA-level feat that will take us to amazing market caps (in contravention of the Fidelity Effect) whereas the latter is "packing everyone in clown-car style into a trebuchet and hoping for the best." Why wasn't the scaling up from 10kB blocks to 100kB blocks a "packing everyone in clown-car style into a trebuchet," but all of a sudden the move from 1MB to 2MB or 8MB so much is that it must be fought tooth and nail? 
I gather your view is that it's a slippery slope (with that slope starting right around magic 1MB), but just who do you think is driving this bus? Let's see...
- Devs: worst they can do is refuse to release more code
- Miners: worst they can do is 51% attack, at grave personal expense, then get forked off by a PoW change
- Market: can sell your coin or your side of the fork into oblivion, after which it will be just a science project again
The market is in control. It's not like the market is sensitive to slippery slope arguments, nor could it be stopped from succumbing to them if it were. The market knows not to try to take us to VISA levels by sacrificing security, because the market looks to experts, and has a process of vesting greater and greater influence with those who have proven successful at distilling expert knowledge and using it to predict outcomes. That is really, in a rough nutshell, how the world operates. 
If you are right, you have nothing to fear by trusting the market. It is not the mob, and it won't just do something silly - people have real money on the line. You are one of the eminent experts the market looks to, as are the other devs at Core, but you are certainly not the only ones. If you are confident in the validity of your claims, encourage market choice by either allowing blocksize to be adjustable in Core or welcoming competition from from other implementations that have *different* consensus parameters. Doing this before it is happens by itself will surely help preserve goodwill. The idea to change PoW that you and Luke were talking about is quite appropriate if Core's (or Classic's) preferred chain gets marginalized by the market and its supporters nonetheless wish to keep that minority chain in operation in hopes that the majority chain will stumble. That way the market can actually make the choice and your ideas can be vindicated or not.

People get confused because in Bitcoin the ledger and protocol have thus far been tied together. This won't be the case in the future. Altcoin investing is just a donation to the founders and early miners, unless you want to trade the swings, because long term if any altcoin were to show a unique benefit that Bitcoin wanted to incorporate but somehow couldn't, people would just copy the protocol for the altcoin and have the initial coin distribution be proportional to everyone's Bitcoin holdings. Then everyone in the Bitcoin community would use that ledger, not the new ledger for the altcoin, and that other ledger would go to zero or maybe survive at a tiny market cap among some people who found it before they found Bitcoin (so they see *Bitcoin* as the altcoin).

It's like Mark is thinking, "A controversial change can be imposed on me, therefore it can be imposed on a me by a government." This is wrong twice over. 
1) A controversial change can't be imposed on you; you're always free to stick with 1MB and sell off your coins in the market-favored fork. (If you're worried about 51% attacks you could implement Luke's idea and change the mining algo.)
2) Even if you consider the market stopping its support for your favored version "a controversial change being forced on you," it doesn't follow that a government can come in and alter Bitcoin as it sees fit. The market would have to support it. Now you might say the government can shut down the market, etc., but this is just an attack scenario that always existed. 
Mark's mental model on this appears to be so fuzzy that he's got it exactly backwards. The reality is **hard forks are the only market-driven way to 
*resolve* a controversy**.  It is the notion that controversial hard forks must be avoided that centralizes control and makes Bitcoin vulnerable to a government attack, even if that attack were limited to freezing the Bitcoin code and never allowing any further changes. 
It seems in his mind he has it that it's Satoshi's initial setting in stone or the stewardship of the Core devs that ensures something like the 21M coin limit stays put. It isn't. It's the market's preference for 21M being set in stone, because the market knows changing it means a loss of confidence in Bitcoin as hard money - its core value proposition. That is why no government can come in and change it. 
The same, however, does not apply to the blocksize cap, because even though it is controversial the market is not wedded to any arbitrary number like 1MB over say 2MB. During a hardfork, the market may or may not support a change, but just because it does - through a decentralized process - that doesn't mean a government could come in a impose changes in a centralized fashion. 
In fact, the idea that it's  the wise shepherding of the Core devs that is what is preventing a government from imposing changes is far scarier. Co-opting a dev team or a repo is far easier than trying to endrun a market - and anyway if governments could do such a thing to the market Bitcoin would have no hope in the first place. 
Hard forks are the only way for the market to express its will, which is the only way for Bitcoin to remain both decentralized and viable. This "all boils down to normalcy" anyway, as we knew all along that Bitcoin was a matter of trusting the market. A rejection of controversial hard forks is market denialism and fundamentally anti-Bitcoin. Devs always had to satisfy the market or get forked off, controversial change or otherwise. The hard fork just makes this reality clear. 
Finally, even if all this is unconvincing on the point that **hard forks are exactly what is needed in a controversy**, there is no means of avoiding a hard fork anyway if the market wants one. The outcome is one of three cases: the market values your favored version, the market values a different version, or the market values a split where both versions retain significant value (this would likely mean there is actually value in splitting the ledger into two copies, and probably changing the PoW algo on one of them). 
- If if values yours, there's no problem. 
- If it doesn't, you're free to continue using it but no one will trade with you - it's a change being imposed on you but in a fully decentralized manner and there's no point is railing against it as it was always the case the market could move against you. (Heck, the market *could* end up being dumb and selling BTC down to near zero at any time, for any reason - that's nothing new, and controversial hard forks don't change this). 
- If the market values both, we agree to disagree, no one gets imposed on any more than you can say a price drop imposed something on you, and if the market is wise - as Bitcoin is predicated on trusting it to be - we'll all be better off under the split, for example because there *really did* turn out to be a need for a SettlementCoin and a CurrencyCoin type of arrangement (I doubt it, but it's a conceivable scenario).
In no case does anything bad happen. In no case does any government to impose anything it couldn't already.

Classic should coexist with Core. Since Core isn't opposed to 2MB in principle, if the market decides on 2MB in a hard fork, Core can just switch to 2MB and we might have roughly half the nodes running Core and half the nodes running Classic for example. 
The idea isn't to have Classic usurp Core's throne. The idea is step away from there being any throne in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-19 01:54:18
And who better to decide what should be the core of Bitcoin than the market rather than a bureaucracy? It's not like that can be avoided anyway. If the market doesn't like the core of Bitcoin as it is, it will throw it off by selling BTC off. Investors would of course prefer that the market has options in case it doesn't like that core of Bitcoin, which is why fork arbitrage is inevitable *unless Core happens to get it perfect*. It's a possibility, but not looking too likely right now.
If the market likes sidechains - when they are ready - it will support them.

as if the people supporting BIP101 weren't also planning optimizations like IBLT and weak blocks. (In fact, XT already supports thin blocks, and Bitcoin Unlimited is about to roll out its own brand of thin blocks.)
It's also a strange dichotomy to act as if "we" (the market, investors, miners, infrastructure businesses, stakeholders) are just the product management department and don't have any way of distilling engineering informations. Drawing from the wisdom of crowds is what a market does, and this crowd has an incredible amount of engineering talent that is by no means limited to the Core devs.

I'm banking that it happens when there is sufficient pressure to do so. Core thinks it can prevent the pressure from getting too high (through things like SW), while others are doubtful. I imagine that if Classic flops the pressure will build (or not) and then we will fork (or not, if it's not needed). Either way Bitcoin seems safe and a great investment right now since investors are skittish about this unfamiliar dynamic (based on actions of both sides) and that's holding the price down.

If so, they really shouldn't mind and will continue working on Bitcoin, unless they really think a move to a mere 2MB wrecks the whole project.

I'm so glad someone else sees this as I've been pounding the table about it for a year now. Absolute must-read and understand for everyone on both sides of the debate. It never had to be this caustic word-battle. It could have played out in minutes on an easy-to-implement futures market where we put our money where our mouths are - "making cheap talk expensive" as Paul Sztorc says. 
The legendary effectiveness of prediction markets at distilling the wisdom of crowds, taking into account all experts, would ensure the market expresses itself most directly. I don't think there is any means of avoiding the market expressing itself anyway, but this method allows it to be more granular, rather than today where the market has to essentially say, "You did something I don't like, so have a rally" or "You did something I don't like, so have a crash." Bitcoin lives and dies by the market, so it can only benefit Bitcoin if the market can express itself more clearly, saying what paths it likes and doesn't like.
One small note: Provided the process is well-publicized in advance and happens on all the major exchanges, I do think it would be over in minutes, or even seconds, because of the feedback loop the author mentions. As soon as one side is significantly in the lead, everyone else who is quick enough gets an easy near-doubling of their coins by piling on.

No, altcoins were always doomed to be pump and dumps, *unless* marketed to a sui generis group (people who aren't invested in Bitcoin). Any bitcoiner will just use the spinoff version of any altcoin that gains popularity, short-circuiting the altcoin ledger completely, except for the outside investment interest. Ripple is the only one with much such interest, and it is a horrific one so hardly worrying. 
All this is being a little too generous, though, because even if you market an altcoin to a sui generis group of investors, you still have to overcome the monetary network effects of Bitcoin. The ledger is extremely mature after years of spills and thrills, so very hard to shake people out. New altcoins, especially premines like Ripple have the opposite problem, which is why they tend to fall greatly in market cap over time after the initial pump.

It doesn't matter what we agree is too low. What matters are the economics. The economics kick in at ~50% of hashing power and ~50% of community by purchasing power, infrastructural entrenchment, etc. 
That is reality, and while the closer we get to 100% consensus the greater the chance we avoid a split into two Bitcoins (neither of them altcoins by Jeff Garzik's definition), this is not controllable by anyone, nor is it even necessarily desirable to avoid such a split (if it happens despite the overwhelming economic incentive to stay with the dominant ledger, the market likely felt a split was more value-enhancing). 
If even a slight majority is reached by whatever economic standard is relevant, the move and/or split is inevitable. Trying to stem the tide by exerting centralized control is pointless, paternalistic, anti-market, and against Bitcoin's ethos of decentralization.

This is not an assumption of lack of skill, merely a lack of assumption of skill. This makes sense because the context is the refrain from Core that we should "trust the experts." The implication is that Core devs are experts on *all* aspects of Bitcoin that impinge the controversial issues of today, because they are ones that work on the code and do the cryptography for the dominant implementation.


By trying to include an escape valve here you inadvertently destroy your whole argument. If the devs can cover over their gaps in knowledge by looking to the advice of experts, the market of investors and stakeholders can do the same. *That* is how Bitcoin is governed, and that's why it's not going to just remove the 21M coin cap without your stewardship (were it even possible to maintain such stewardship indefinitely in the face of market resistance).

It is basically futarchy in action, prediction market powered governance (as I would argue was actually what Satoshi was originally reaching toward in the whitepaper with the idea of CPU voting). No need to argue anymore. We can all be friends again.

You're simply describing what miners would never be incentivized to do. Parent's point was that if miners - whether by delusion or prudence - went against, say, Coinbase, Coinbase is screwed as their chain gets 51% attacked to oblivion. If miners ever do that out of delusion then Bitcoin has a demonstrably broken governance model and everyone loses. If miners do it out of prudence, only Coinbase loses.

Yes. Nakamoto consensus != informal consensus of some devs. 
It's a little off-putting to see "consensus" used as a buzzword, taking advantage of its positive associations in Bitcoin. "You cannot go against the consensus because Bitcoin is a consensus system" sounds good until you realize they're using two entirely different meanings of the term in the same sentence.
@_date: 2016-01-13 00:07:51
Democratic consensus is irrelevant to an economic system. Just because "Bitcoin operates by [Nakamoto] consensus" has nothing whatsoever to do with democratic consensus being required for a change. If 60% agree to the change, the other 40% can either grin and bear it or stick with their current fork if they think it will survive. Most likely they will go along. Only if 2MB were incredibly abhorrent to all 40% would they stay on their 1MB fork, and only if the market likes 1MB would those miners remain economically viable.
@_date: 2016-01-17 03:29:34
Classic can just be forked again to put it back if the market likes opt-in RBF. Open source means there should be no hostility toward people who fork Core code, but there is.

At some point *not* making a needed change that the majority of the market wants will cause the price to tank more than going against the 49% (or 25% especially). I mean, the minority 49% isn't likely to have even half the investment, so the worst they could do is sell half the coins. Short term it might be a huge drop, but over a few months it should even out to half the price we have now. And that's the absolute worst case. In reality probably very few of the minority would sell many coins. Meanwhile, transaction backlog and high fees could easily cause a halving or quartering of Bitcoin's market cap.
I think miners know which side their butter is breaded on, and it's not on indulging the economic minority while the economic majority is champing at the bit for a change.

That's pretty generous of you since their statement basically said the censorship didn't really happen, it was all just to combat the "brigading." This is classic Core doublespeak where it says one thing and means the opposite. While looking like a denouncement they are doubling down on the r/Bitcoin mods' position that voting by bitcoiners, which is coming from users who also hang out in other subs because of the heavy moderation, needs to be combated by heavy moderation. 
I understand that as an investor it looks like trusting Core is the simplest path to a higher price, but it isn't. Trusting the market is the simplest path, and until recently the market was unable to voice its preference because there was only on set of consensus rules to choose from. Now there are choices and people are fighting tooth and nail to dissuade people from those choices and return control to "THE experts" instead of letting the market choose. Insofar as they succeed, the market is reduced nodding or shaking its head, and right now it is shaking its head. 
@_date: 2016-01-29 04:13:02
I've never seen a more perfect illustration of someone not understanding how Bitcoin works. He thinks the devs have to be the ones to decide everything or the market would just do absurd populist things. "That 21M coin limit? It's only because wise devs like me are in control."

OK, but then this doesn't explain why 90% is the right number. "Higher is safer" was already known. The question is what is high enough to be safe without giving holdouts too much veto power. If 75:25 can become 25:75, 90:10 can become 40:60, at least.

It's the original design. That may seem wrong, but it isn't: in order to enable CPU voting as mentioned in the whitepaper, every setting that is controversial should be easy for users to adjust. 
The 1MB blocksize limit wasn't controversial when it was originally implemented so there was no reason to make it user-adjustable, but it has become controversial so now the argument is reversed: leaving it as non-adjustable (despite it becoming controversial) is what represents a new design and new governance theory being tried out. With no whitepaper even.

But it is (*well, 2MB and then 4MB in two years). What other changes do you think will be in the Classic release this week?
After that, provided Core doesn't fire itself or change the hashing algo, meaning they reluctantly jump to 2MB as well, Classic becomes just another option again and no one has any need to download their subsequent updates that may contain other stuff. Just because a user downloads the Core+2MB client from Classic repo doesn't mean they have to download the next one from Classic.

If it splits, it was probably better that it split. Of course it's ridiculous to expect a split over this, but if you hold to that idea then it probably is better as it means there are plenty if die-hards willing to keep using the lower-priced side of the fork. They are free to conduct their economic experiment with no risk, for spenders at least. 
No harm done (except to merchants and net buyers, which is why the minority fork will have an especially hard time), since everyone retains equal stake in both and the minority will likely die off soon unless the minority really wants to support it, then we are back to square one. No one ever takes your options away; but that doesn't mean you can get the market to support your side of the fork.

As a major big block supporter, I must agree on this point. Fees are not high yet, and there's probably some room for them to get higher without people complaining. This aspect *is* often exaggerated by my fellow big blockers. Fee markets are not the end of the world. 
However, it is crucial to recognize that any fee pressure does constitute an Economic Change Event and more to the point it opens the door for competition from altcoins. As soon as it's slightly cheaper to use an altcoin, people who need to do a lot of small transactions will do it. Bitcoin cannot afford to be infinitely conservative; at some point the risk created by conservatism exceeds the risk the conservative approach was meant to avoid.
Again, this may not happen for a while. We may be able to have quite a bit of fee pressure before things get dangerous for Bitcoin's position. But I see no reason to assume that this danger is any less than whatever dangers people are worried about with a blocksize cap increase. This is what I mean when I say coders are not the only experts we should seek guidance from. What do coders know about market cap takeover?

Well that's the real trick isn't it. As long as there are no hard forks, the market is limited to nodding its head YES or shaking its head NO. It gets really hard to tell what the market is responding to, if anything. 
People see it like an inkblot test: "If the price falls it was because it doesn't like the other side. If the price rises it's because it likes my side."
A hard fork enables - for the first time - the market to actually choose between Option A and Option B. It can buy one side of the fork and sell off the other. Or even more smoothly, it can [buy futures in one fork and short futures in the other]( so that the outcome can be basically a lock before the fork even happens.
Then we wouldn't have to argue about the blocksize, because the market would give us its answer so fast that our arguments would be pointless as we already know what it will support.

If you rely on a comment here to convince you, it won't be nearly detailed enough to give you a complete understanding. That means while you may invest, and the price will likely go up and you'll make some money, you'll miss out on the big bucks because you never learned enough to have a strong conviction to endure the wild swings up and down. 
Most people who bought at $1 sold at $2 or $3, ecstatic that they could double or triple their money. You might think you can ride it from $400 to $40,000 but you can't. If you invest 5K, it'll be swinging up and down in the tens or hundreds of thousands per day after a while. There's no way you hold through that based on a few small arguments. You have to investigate it yourself to know for certain what the odds are and why.

And if that happens we just drain its value back into Bitcoin via the spinoff method. As an investor the only possible concern long-term is if the ledger gets messed up.

Interesting sentiment. It sounds like you're admitting that a huge reason 77% of miners are not switching away from Core is that they are afraid of the coders not being skilled enough.

Of course it does. Hodlers don't want to hodl on a ledger than can be 51% attacked. 
However, miners will only mine on the chain that they expect to be most valuable, so this is not a mechanism of miner *control.* It's merely an observation that if miners are going against the market, Bitcoin is in dire straits anyway as its original governance mechanism is broken.

Indeed, they don't but they could. They could go against the wishes of the economic majority and kill Bitcoin for themselves and everyone else, but they don't. Cars could slam into you for no reason, they could control your life in a manner of speaking, but they don't. This is the concept known as *incentives*.
Phrased more accurately: miners don't have the incentives to control Bitcoin unilaterally. That is why there is nothing to fear, except the ever-present but gradually waning fear that Bitcoin as a whole may not actually work (i.e., because miners might be fools and fail to read the market accurately).

False dichotomy. You can have a marketocracy, where coding ability is given proper weighting but not omnipotence. In fact, I shouldn't say you "can have" a marketocracy, because you really can't NOT have one. Bitcoin will *always* be at the mercy of the market. We can misapprehend its governance structure as a bureaucratic "meritocracy" or "democracy," but the market will always win in the end. We can save a lot of wasted time by getting it right early on. 
And to those who would object that the meritocracy will get it right  and please the market because they are meritworthy, that argument is circular.

Deliver what? 2MB? That's trivially easy to do. Unless Core calls sour grapes and quits, there's no reason to expect users to have to rely on the Classic team for subsequent updates.

There is really no reason for a supermajority requirement. The idea that if a proposed change is submitted and accepted by a ~~super~~**majority** of mining hashpower and bitcoin users' existing keys continue to work with existing UTXOs (bitcoins)...yet discussion of such a change is banned... is already clearly harmful for all sides. 
If some portion of the community were about to do something misguided, the best way to avoid that is to allow it to be discussed so that it can be argued against, for as long as necessary. That such arguments drag on is merely evidence that the threat has yet to be extinguished (or that perhaps it isn't a threat after all). Banning discussion of such things removes from having a say and cannot hold back a popular-but-wrong idea, but it can delay a popular-and-right idea, and it can fragment the discussion and waste a lot of time short term as people figure out how to route around the damage in the communication network.

It's not a commitment that needs to be renewed, it's the fact that Bitcoin has a non-concentrated investor group battle-hardened over years of intense volatility. They won't stand for changes to the intended functionality of the system. This has nothing to do with "chasing" wider adoption though if you're trying to tie this back to blocksize (wider adoption is a blessing if it can be achieved though must be balanced with any risks entailed). 
Ethereum isn't going to see wider adoption thanks to this whitelisting and that probably isn't the aim. The aim is to keep the pump going for just a bit longer, and it seems to be working for that.

No, it means one in every two times (because 51% is already going to lead to 75% easily as fewer than 25% will likely want to go with the minority and its dramstically lower market cap) you are faced with the option of accepting a change that you'd prefer not to accept or accepting a fork with your preferred version at a much lower market cap.
Oh I'm sorry, looks like you do get fucked over, by the market if it doesn't agree with you - *but that is how it always was and always will be.* Bitcoin cannot change that.

Except BTC is the one with the most hashpower, not "the one I like." Regarding overtaking after initial victory, both chains have that issue. That's why miners will only hardfork when victory is assured, as they are motivated by profit. Nothing to fear; the system works. 
The ETF people should twig to the obvious policy soon enough: all branches with significant value are credited into the basket for as long as that value exists. A ledger can exist in a multiplicity with no issue other than wallet accounting getting a bit more complex under the hood.

The reason this can't happen in Bitcoin, besides Eth investors being economic newbs and Bitcoin investors not (a generalization but painfully close to the truth), is that Bitcoin has established itself and its functionality over a period of 7 years, whereas TheDAO was the very first significant example of Ethereum's functionality even being used. 
Etherites somewhat understandably see the system as finding its legs and making the rules up as it goes along, because that's how Vitalik designed it, complete with ICO to ensure he got paid before the system had to actually work. To compare this with Bitcoin is a sick joke.

I at first dismissed the idea that TheDAO hack was the reason, especially with Bitcoin being long overdue for a correction and also the Bitfinex troubles, but considering all the people who probably invested recently because of "blockchain technology," they are probably now reeling from the idea of their smart contract utopia.
The narrative should turn decisively back toward "Bitcoin not blockchain" and then we continue upward, if all goes according to plan.

It can fork in a decentralized way, but the moral hazard remains: a system whose whole selling point was absolute objectivity would be introducing subjectivity. 
In many ways this is *worse* than increasing the inflation schedule in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is supposed to be "hard money," and likewise Ethereum is supposed to be "hard contract law." Bitcoin remains hard money because it has rejected the temptation to introduce subjectivity into the idea of "control is ownership."

If Ethereum itself were hacked, they'd be changing Ethereum with the hard fork to close the loophole.

It operated as intended, or else they'd be forking to ensure it operates as intended in the future. They aren't doing that. They are hard forking to ensure Ethereum *doesn't* operate as intended in this case, to save reckless investors.
Another way to think about it is, if Ethereum intended to roll back any smart contracts that went awry, why wasn't this trumpeted front and center as a benefit? Especially when hundreds of millions are being invested into a single smart contract scheme? Obviously because it is *not* a benefit; it's a tacit admission that the system is not ready for major investment, but the founders didn't want to dissuade investment. In fact they explicitly encouraged people by saying it was safe, and explicitly did NOT say the safety was because of the Vitalik Put.

I do. If Bitcoin isn't easy to change when a change is needed, it will be surpassed by altcoins or outmaneuvered by governments. The *only* reason Bitcoin is hard money is that changing the money supply is abhorrent to sound money investors. 
This is not the case for needed changes. It is not some difficulty of changing that preserves Bitcoin as sound money; it is the wisdom and will of the market of investors. This means that some changes are easy and some are wellnigh impossible. The idea of a blanket "setting in stone" is useless and unnecessary, a notion bandied about by economic ignoramuses who never understood where Bitcoin's solidity came from.

Governments banning Bitcoin: if they do that, they just cut themselves out of the economic loop and also create opportunities for other countries to take a bigger piece of the pie. Same as with the Internet.
Squabbling: controversy is healthy. Far from being harmful, hard forking is the only way to end squabbling if there is a large and deep controversy. It is the only way to give the market a voice. It cannot and should not be avoided. Be careful when your theory of Bitcoin governance has it being controlled by anything other than decentralized market mechanisms that are able to make direct choices on rulesets.

You can vote however you want with your node, but only investors determine if your prefered version is worth anything. 
The problem with Ethereum is its investors are neither strongly distributed (bitter fruit of the ICO/premine), nor battle-hardened from years of volatility (too young, yet another unassailable aspect of the Bitcoin ledger's network effect), nor do I believe Ethereum investors have the average level of understanding of hard money (or hard smart contracts for that matter) that Bitcoin investors do (see how easily they abandoned the original conception and marketing without a second thought). 
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:19:06
I don't mean to be glib, but did you glance at the chart? Any technician was already looking for a correction to retest support any time, as the price has practically gone up in a straight line for weeks. The biggest exchange with a ton of margin trading going down is a perfect trigger to force a bit of caution into the market for a few days. 
This really is such a non-event. I fear for when newbies see *real* Bitcoin volatility like the old days, though they can inoculate themselves against it by looking at the [historical chart]( to see what is normal and what isn't.

Of course there was no opposition. All stakeholders who oppose such things divested of ETH and increased their holdings of ETC instead. This reaffirms that the solidity of a cryptocurrency is the mettle of its investors. ETH investors are fine with arbitrariness and see Ethereum as a moot court for sometimes-immutable smart contracts. ETC investors are the opposite, so even if such a fork happened they would sell it off to zero. That is the difference. 
This is how cryptocurrency governance actually works, and it's pretty cool (not saying Ethereum is cool; just that fork dynamics are interesting).

Difficulty of changing has nothing to do with why Bitcoin's money supply doesn't change. Bitcoin is easy to change since anyone can fork it; the trick is getting the market to support your change. That is not difficult if the market deems the change needed or value enhancing, of course. And even if some part of the market likes a bad change, we can always keep the unadulturated coin while the mainstream messes up.
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:41:46
That's a gigantic rake (50%). Far too large in my opinion, as you will both miss out on much of the gains in a major bull run and also be taking on way too much risk later on (if no rake after that). 
Read the OP and the ensuing discussion [here]( to see how important the rake is. The rule of thumb is, "Hodl until life-changing amount, then sell 10-20% at that point and then 10-20% of the remaining BTC every time it doubles from there." There is a method to it; it's basically how to optimise risk and reward for maximum profits as a hodler. It makes a huge difference. If you rake too much, you miss most of the gains, whereas if you rake too little you end up too risky and are likely to succumb to emotions and sell at the worst time.

Instead they are hard forking only to save people who invested heavily (the "heavily" is crucial, as they sure as heck wouldn't be doing this for a smaller failure - it is truly a TBTF dynamic) without understanding the system. It is a bailout. Moral hazard in every sense of the term.

People were thinking the whole way up, "I'll just wait for the price to dip before buying in." The dip came at $260, when it fell all the way back to $50 for a moment, and of course all those same people were afraid to *actually* buy the dip. Then it settled at $100 (the $3000+ of today). I guess they finally bought then. 
When the market wants to go up a lot, it tends to just go up for quite a while without major correction.

This totally ignores the incentives of nodes, investors, exchanges, infrastructure companies, etc. Under controversy, miners will have to be attuned to the concerns of all these parties in order to stay profitable (not have their blocks orphaned - not by network constraints themselves - but by the Keynesian beauty contest for blocks).

Let's be careful not to conflate software-forks (altcoins, which disenfranchise hodlers) with ledger-forks (forks/spinoffs, which keep hodlers whole). 
A ledger-fork has two sides, and there is no principled way to distinguish which is "BTC" and which isn't, other than the market. The ledger-fork process gives the market a chance to decide which is BTC and which is probably going to be called something else, by convention, due to it being at a much lower price.

There is no "letting." Miners can already mine whatever size blocks they want, by modding their code. The reason they don't is that their resulting chain will be worthless if they mine them too big. 
The language of "letting" and  "forcing" and "deciding" has no place in Bitcoin. It makes clear thinking about these issues nearly impossible. The language to use is the language of incentives, profits, and investment:
On any matter on which there is controversy, such as blocksize, miners have every financial incentive to be hyper-attuned to ecosystem needs so as to ensure their blocks don't get orphaned by angry nodes or other miners who don't want to anger the economically important nodes (such as the exchange where they sell their mined coins) for fear of losing their investment.

It makes me think Bitcoin shows a natural power-law distribution. 
The next price rise will see radical redistribution of this wealth, as all the past rises have. No discussion of wealth distribution in Bitcoin is complete without acknowledging ["the rake."]( The rake is completely obvious when you consider the incentives of a hodler as the price rises orders of magnitude, and the logic is irrefutable: almost all of anyone's holdings will be redistributed due to incentives. (The only exception is people who were already very rich and invested very little of their net worth.)

Thinking about "nodes" as just these generic entities is damaging to clear thinking on this issue. Think of Coinbase's nodes, Bitstamp's nodes, major hodlers' nodes, government nodes of competing countries, etc. These nodes do have power in the relationship, because their acceptance of the blocks miners issue does matter. 
The answer to the tragedy of the commons is the [Keynesian beauty contest]( + interwoven incentives. In other words, in a situation of controversy, such as  concerns by nodes about how big blocks are getting, individual miners suddenly have a ton of incentive to figure out how not to step on the ecosystem's toes, because if they mine too big a block the other miners may refuse to build on it - not because they can't handle it themselves, but because they know nodes will be pissed off, investors may sell/fork/"fire the miners," and maybe even the exchange they usually sell their mined coins at will not recognize their chain. In short, miners have every incentive to police the network themselves to ensure no rogue miner is mining abusive blocks...which really means a better name for them is "money-losing blocks." 
Any tragedy of the commons is eliminated because in the mining world "overfishing the commons" ultimately requires the cooperation of everyone else in the ecosystem to some degree, and every miner knows that and reacts accordingly.

I agree with your gist but I think Nakamoto consensus isn't the right term here, as it refers exclusively to the PoW mechanism for ordering transactions in a chain. Rather, blocks that the ecosystem considers too big will be orphaned because other miners recognize that the rest of the ecosystem considers them too big and will reject them. It's nothing to do with consensus, but instead with intertwined incentives in a market-like process. 
Under controversy, miners are revealed to be a special type of investor that makes bets based on their ascertainment of ecosystem needs. If they bet too aggressively (try to sweep too many juicy transactions in a huge block) they will get orphaned by their peers even if their peers can handle that blocksize, because their peers know the rest of the ecosystem will be upset and may reject the block (along with the new blocks their peers add). If they bet too conservatively (by making tiny blocks), they leave money on the table. Their financial incentive is to make blocks as big as possible *without* stepping on any significant part of the Bitcoin economy's toes. 
It's a beautiful system for optimizing the blocksize and the "voting" mechanism (really a market-like incentive mechanism) is actually mentioned clearly in the original whitepaper.
@_date: 2016-12-14 18:11:56
Actually this just means controversy is rising and miners now have to start paying attention as they were always supposed to. If this trend keeps up, miners running Core may be the ones mining coins that can't be spent anywhere. Miners are finally being called on to serve in their stewardship role to resolve a controversy. No more is it just "plug in and make money."

If it isn't good for everyone else, the nodes will consider their blocks invalid, investors won't value their chain, etc. That's the equilibrium. And every miner is aware of this, so it wouldn't even actually have to fall on the nodes to ignore the blocks: other miners would refuse to build on them, knowing this. It's a tightly interwoven system of incentives, similar to a Keynesian beauty contest.

It may not be appropriate to call that Nakamoto consensus, but that's just a naming issue.

It's an extraordinarily weak argument and irrelevant in any case. Not only is a hard fork not a change to anything, but instead a copy, but even if it were a change the only "contract" that matters is the obvious one: *Bitcoin is to operate as sound money with the well-known issuance schedule*. Whatever changes are necessary to help maintain that are fair game vis a vis that contract, and if people think they are ill-advised as ways of maintaining that contract, they can choose the other side of the fork - whoever initiates it.
This notion being bandied about that forks "force" anyone to do anything is just bizarre. Hard forks create choice. If there were a way to prevent hard forks (which there isn't), *that* would be something that could be called forcing.

This whole debate makes me think more and more that the devs are trying to provide a protection that is really the miners' job to provide, and that miners are indeed the most incentivized to provide. They want everyone to be happy, and their interests are intertwined with each other and with nodes and with investors, so that rogue actions are highly disincentivized. The system was set up so that we trust the miners but don't have to because they have the right incentives. Arbitrary limits imposed in top-down manner by devs just interfere with that, by crowding out miner incentive ("why bother, when Core has it handled?") and interfering with the establishment of market signalling and communication that best enables miners to avoid stepping on anyone's toes inadvertantly.

Well by all means let's build every way that works to maintain all the features we all care about. If LN can work in the right ways then I would be fine with it, but that has yet to be shown. If the money function remains preserved even at 100MB blocks it makes sense to scale that way - the simplest way - first. If I believed we could really only go to 4MB before starting to compromise the store of value functionality, I would be a lot less bullish on Bitcoin and would be looking for alternative scaling solutions like LN. 
It's just that I have never seen concrete numbers of min spec for a full node, etc. It's a funhouse of moving targets, with no reason to think the actual relevant limit is anywhere even in the ballpark of 1MB (would be a gigantic coincidence anyway).
More than that, if the limit is anywhere near here, I would like the market to be setting it, rather than some trusted devs. That requires a hard fork at least be made available so that the market can start to express itself.

It's become a little too much like Obama's campaign slogan, "Change you can believe in." Everyone just reads "feel good" into it.

This is absolutely untrue of the big blockers that I regularly converse with. The main thread where our discussions have gathered has been for years been titled, "Gold Collapsing. Bitcoin UP." *Gold.* We are hard money folks through and through.
Bitcoin is Gold 2.0, but limiting its ability to transact directly in the settlement layer is a form of censorship - who decides who gets to transact? If it must be decided, it must be decided by the market, which requires a hard fork or else the choice is binary: YES to Bitcoin as it stands or NO to Bitcoin as it stands. 
Without a hard fork, or at least a futures market in hard forks, it is impossible for the market to voice a choice in *what might be* rather than what is vs. nothing. As recently said, the ledger is valuable because it is uncensorable AND updatable. Messing with the updatability by artificially limiting transaction volume is messing with the fundamental driving force of the ledger's power. 
You simply cannot have a settlement system without having wide use in commerce. Otherwise you have too little network effect; when a company is going out of business they can't rely on the settlement units *because they don't buy anything in the real commercial economy.* Something can only be trusted in settlement if it is known that there is always demand for it. All the banks simply switching to a different system, such as due to government pressure, would kill the settlement units' value. It needs to spread as far and wide as possible. 
Thus settlement layer and everyday commerce are intimately connected. It won't do to pretend that the other doesn't exist. And whatever you may think this argument, know that it is absolutely false that most big blockers - at least any that I know of - think Bitcoin should be a credit or payment-only system.

Many parties work but only one can have final say. That is centralized.
If that's not convincing, consider why decentralization is a good thing: because it prevents hijacking and having to trust any one person or small group. Any one repo is absolutely vulnerable to hijacking and relying exclusively on that repo for your updates inherently involves having to trust one person or small group.

Most nuts are not fit for consumption without various treatments, especially not almonds with the skins. Though eating enough vitamin C from fruit with them will help mitigate the damage. Macadamia nuts are least damaging, but you'll end up with all sorts of mineral deficiencies in a few years regardless, due to phytic acid content. Like grains, most nuts were never traditionally just eaten without sun drying, roasting, soaking in water for days, burying in the ground, fermenting, etc. Modern food is so bad that people don't even notice the damaging effects of eating nuts straight, just because they don't hurt you as badly as Pop Tarts and Hot Pockets.

It's strange that you say that, because that is exactly how Bitcoin works now. Some people run Core's consensus algo and some people run a competing algo. No disaster, because no one is mining &gt;1MB blocks since they know those blocks will very likely be orphaned. 
Many users running a client with a user-selectable blocksize cap is no different to the current situation in principle. It merely makes it more convenient for the user: instead of having to download a different client with a different cap when they want to support a different cap, they can simply change a setting on their client's menu.

Actually the mathematical rules *are* an illusion, or rather a Schelling point around which consensus can temporarily gather. The market rides those rules for as long as they're good for, and feels free to switch out any rules that become obsolete. I think the blocksize is a rule that the market will find obsolete very soon, but for example the inflation schedule is not such a rule (for obvious reasons).

How is software a "coin" at all? It seems strange to me to call Bitcoin or any coin a consensus of software then turn around and say it's a consensus of the economic majority, because whatever that may mean, it certainly must be a consensus of *people*. That means one can run a piece of software without subscribing to everything in it, especially lines of code that aren't currently relevant, whether it changes a "consensus rule" (a misnomer if consensus is really among people) or not.
For example, if there were a super-cool new version that implemented IBLT and thin blocks and weak blocks BUT it stopped the halving in the year 2090, and you decide to run it now in 2015 with every intention of changing it if you live to 2090, do you automatically consent to that inflation change? Are you supporting an altcoin?

If you really think it will come down to it, let the rational part of the community split off and the irrational part go elsewhere.

2) Guy totally misunderstood the idea of "dictator" of a repo. A dictator of a repo is not a dictator of Bitcoin, unless there is only one repo. The way to avoid being dictated at is to have *choice* in repos, not to avoid "dictators" of each repo. This is so basic and easy to understand, I'm not sure why so many get caught up on the word "dictator," a guy who cannot dictate shit to anyone.

Greg missed Peter's point completely. 
The relevant question is, "How do investors holding BTC and trading on the BTC price - and hence economically rational miners working for 25BTC block rewards - value the adherence to blocksize rules versus adherence to inflation schedule rules?"
The answer is crystal clear. Inflation schedule and blocksize may be "technically" on some kind of equal footing, but they are vastly different from the market's perspective. Change the inflation schedule and you have a worthless coin because investors sold it off. Change the blocksize and, as long as investors support the change, you have a coin that is at least as valuable as before.
Greg labeled this line of reasoning "political," which would make it off-topic for the mailing list, but it sounds like just plain market economics to me.

There is no "be conservative and err on the side of too slow," because Bitcoin is not happening in a vacuum. Go too slow and network effect will be lost to competitors. 
Bitcoin has to walk the middle path between too slow to remain the World Wide Ledger and too fast to remain secure. Who among us is able to determine the right amount of conservatism, let alone what kinds of risks should be taken? None of us are. That's why I think any method of determining what protocol(s) maintain the Bitcoin ledger that does not rely on the market is doomed. A single preset group of people cannot decide. There needs to be financial competition among possible future versions of Bitcoin - a futures market for forks.

People have gotten so exasperated at Core that they start to think of moving to an altcoin. They want fast gains. Bitcoin investors should decide how much they care about an altcoin overtaking Bitcoin in market cap, even if it's just a temporary pump and dump that will be forgotten a year from now. Many people have chosen to ride that short-term wave. This could be stemmed by increasing the blocksize now, though if you only care about the long term I guess delaying is still an option (I don't see any dark marketeers or Venezuelan emigrants complaining about high Bitcoin fees and stuck transactions, so I reason it is still early).

Kicking the can helps network effect, though. With altcoins as the barbarians at the gates, this "small constant" can matter a whole lot.

Ir reallt doesn't make sense to say the sub is supporting Eth, let alone Dash. Some are supporting it, many are not. There has been an Eth incursion recently during the pump, but that is the same as it used to be here before altcoins were deemed off-topic. I personally think it's far better to see what people are thinking so they can be unburdened from their false ideas by arguments!

Or because Eth is a highly speculative game, especially TheDAO. No investor seems to see it as a store of value, and yet they fail to realize that without being a store of value no other functionality can really last.

If merge mining makes Namecoin insecure, what does that say about merge mining for sidechains?
@_date: 2016-05-24 07:27:30


Sounds ideal, as long as the minority branch changes the PoW and signing algorithms. Then everyone could get what they want (not really consensus-breaking at all) and the market would decide whose vision is superior (or might even like both). If the one branch dies in the market (or vice versa), no harm done, all  BTC investors remain whole except those who gambled by selling off their coins in the winning branch coins to get more dying coins (or vica versa), or those who mined the dying branch.

They could have just forked the Bitcoin ledger with a new protocol, preserving everyone's coins. Since they didn't, they chose pump-and-dump gains over advancement of technology. Any altcoin choosing the P&amp;D path like Ethereum can be near-instantly obliterated by a [spinoff]( released in Bitcoin that is just a copy of the open source altcoin protocol with initial coin distribution identical to Bitcoin's current one. Then for every substantial Bitcoin stakeholder, the shortest path to owning a substantial stake in a system that does everything the altcoin does is to sit tight, rather than to buy any of the altcoin. 
The altcoin dies on the vine, and sadly this happens the moment it shows any substantial real world utility. It is a perfect pump and dump, from start to finish, and I'm frankly a little embarrassed for all the people who fail to see this yet think they understand cryptocurrency. Sure, you can make big money, but you could have also made big money on Jeff Garza's coin.

Re: blocking the stream
As I noted elsewhere, it doesn't even matter if Core devs are paragons of virtue and Blockstream's plan is exactly what Bitcoin needs. Just the fact that we cannot know, just the possibility that Core dev *could* be compromised, has accentuated the need for decentralized governance of the protocol.

Tell me you've at least heard of and understand the concept of commodification (of ASICs). That's the end goal we want for maximum decentralization of mining. Reverting to GPU just pushes us back so we must go through the danger phase again.
Also, it would put many miners out of business. People will think twice about ever getting into the mining industry from then on, meaning less total security for Bitcoin. Change of PoW should be a sword of Damocles over the miners, but only ever activated in nearly the direst of circumstances.

Ethereum = low-hanging fruit of investor-bate
Ethereum basically took all the cool, flashy things people wanted to experiment with but most cryptos haven't touched for security reasons and put them into a platform. This excites the typical altcoin investor, much like Bitshares and NXT did with their DEXes and smart contracts and BitUSD, and also attracts devs who are less able to deal with Bitcoin's scripting language.
They still have not developed a single useful application outside of gambling apps and things used internally in Ethereum, so the concept remains very much unproven. It's a nice effort, several steps bolder than Bitshares and NXT, but way too early to say it's the future of anything.
Also, Fred thinks about Bitcoin incorrectly. It's not the protocol, it's the ledger. The ledger can take on any protocol it wants, or even any number of protocols simultaneously (though the ledger will diverge from that point; every Bitcoin holder has equal stake in all, only new investors see them as multiple "coins").
Proof of Stake? Gimma a break. Greg and Adam do understand cryptography and security, I'll give them that: 
As for Vitalik's "weak subjectivity":
 (EDIT: forget the last digit)
All that said, the delay on blocksize is opening the door for all this, and pointlessly so. Bitcoin isn't reliant on strong consensus, only Nakamoto consensus. The thing that holds Bitcoin together is market incentives. It is much more antifragile that the Core devs think. Let's be a little more experimental or else we WILL get taken over.

And Doge had no premine. Ripple exceeded Bitcoin's market cap once, thanks to its huge premine.
@_date: 2016-05-29 15:04:42
Yes, but since the link is coinmarketcap.com it's important to note for newbies that this applies many times over to most of the altcoins, some of them in particular are massively inflated by premines, ninjamines, instamines, and ICOs. So the "Bitcoin dominance" percentage and the market cap ranking are not at all reliable.
@_date: 2015-11-22 19:00:12
Anti-fragility is fun: most defenses that Bitcoin needs to equip itself with to reach higher market caps will only come about because of some kind of new attack, so we get to experience constantly more novel attack vectors being attempted. 
The cool thing is that it doesn't even matter if Blockstream is actually an unmitigated blessing for Bitcoin and the current Core devs are the best and most virtuous team possible. The very fact that they *could* be compromised has been brought to the fore, and therefore the weakness of centralized development will be addressed.
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:54:45
Doesn't matter. Anyone can and will fork the code when needed, and the moment it is clearly economically more viable to go with the fork, investor money will move there and everyone else will follow. Bitcoin is unique among protocols in that it is a creature of the market, formed continually by the market, not something that can be held down and ossified in arbitrary ways, because ossification doesn't always please the market.

A borderline illegal one that might happen on anonymous decentralized markets (is OB there yet?) is medical/nutritional advisor or doctor, like that one site tried to do.

Rallies like these, if they continue instead of going back down, will tend to go much higher (instead of just sitting around here). Of course there will always be retracements where the price goes back down for a moment, so we won't know until it retraces *then* goes up more, like above $600. Then $1000 will feel close.

You're right that ETH is way harder to scale than Bitcoin, but there are many coins that aren't. And ETH could easily pivot to take advantage. This is a competitive environment; conservatism cannot be as high as some people would like while optimizing the probability of success. In a competitive environment, insisting on very low risk of failure can result in higher risk of losing the network effect battle.
It would make me feel a lot better if those advocating the ultraconservative approach included this consideration in their analysis, but I haven't seen that. I have only seen arguments that seem to model Bitcoin as if it is in a vacuum.

As a regular poster over there, I agree. I've been trying to calm them down, but many are convinced that being anti-Core means they have to move to an altcoin. And to be fair, that narrative has come from here as well, in the form of calling controversial hard forks attacks. If that narrative were true, they would be right to switch to altcoins if they don't like Core, because forking away with anything else would be controversial of course. But I don't think it is true; I think controversy is one of the very situations hard forks are there to resolve. I can respect the viewpoint that controversial hard forks are attacks, but proponents of that view should realize the inevitable result of people believing that is altcoins rising higher than they otherwise would.

I wouldn't say it is out-innovating Bitcoin until it actually is shown to work for a real use case that makes money. They are out-experimenting Bitcoin maybe, but I doubt they have economic grounding to make it work, and that is the key to everything. Vitalik sounds like a Zeitgeister, for one thing, as do many other etherites.
