I use  and have for more than 2 years. I had a mishap where they didn't execute at the right price. I emailed them and they corrected it within a few days. 
Once you have it on coinbase, you can do a lot with it. I personally used multibit as my offline wallet. I'm sure there are many others.

coinbase charges 1% sell and 1% buy... how is 3.4% supposed to be competitive

I like where your heads at... my thoughts are this would put too much control in the hands of the banks (even more than now)

So I just came across this article... here's a quote thats a little confusing/concerning... 
“If Coinbase promotes XT to customers on coinbase.com and/or switches all of its full nodes to BIP 101 software, then Coinbase is no longer using the Bitcoin currency, and it doesn’t belong on @_date: 2015-12-16 03:03:15
But why male models?

It's not a classified currency yet so technically it isn't legal tender

I was aware of the economic/marketing term. Just wondering people's take on how it relates to bitcoin..appreciate the reply

I don't know much, but in regard to the network effect: Does the amount of users TRADING and USING bitcoins lend to this effect, or those who are holding them in cold storage? or is it a combination? and in that case, could the network effect then be extended to include bitcoins mined? I am confused, can someone please shed some light on the network effect as it relates to bitcoin

Although I agree that there is no way to truly understand where the value of bitcoins will be in short and long term, there is still value in reading the price, volume, transaction charts etc., as there are notable trends. Not that I have sustained any profits (yet), but I have been successful in short term predictions.

It's been above 51% for a long time now. The guy who owns GHASH also owns another hash renting/ pool mining company --- and everytime it gets close he transfers a large portion to his other company.. so it's been above 51% for awhile

Looks pretty sketchy.. you would think someone like bit pay would have an ipo before a vaporizing company... am very intrigued as both marijuana and bitcoin could potentially be legal in the us in the next few years... but like I said.. sketchy

My advice is to invest at any point in the $400 range. This is still the making of a new world currency. No one knows what the price will sink in to, but I sure as hell know that speculation will carry btc into the $500 at the very least. I personally believe it will go much higher in the next 0-3 years. Cheers.

Based on Mike Hearns recent post, I now see this as another person just leaving Bitcoin to create something better.

Excellent read. I hadn't really considered smaller businesses adopting the public Bitcoin blockchain in lieu of paying for their own private one. I work for an investment software company and believe most of my clients will soon be sending their daily transactions and trade files over the blockchain. Cheers.

i didn't even know it wasn't cnn until i read this

Noted. Still, for domestic it seems this will soon become a reality. Nasdaq has already successfully sent trade transaction data over their own private blockchain.
