**No, it really isn't about ideology.**
* It is a [straw man]( to suggest that not lifting the limit is being proposed. As, has been pointing out, there are other more sophisticated proposals for dealing with ***not&amp;nbsp;only*** blocksize changes, but other alterations to the consensus algorithm.
    The problem, as many have pointed out, is that causing a **hard&amp;nbsp;fork** in the blockchain is very bad policy.
* A **soft fork** is such that the "losing" minority will automatically keep updated to the "winning" majority's work, because the majority's work is still valid to the minority; it's just that the minority's work may not be valid to the majority.
    Essentially, the minority has already agreed to the majority; the existing contract allows for this. This is unlike a **hard&amp;nbsp;fork**, where at least two factions never agree on a longest chain.
    A **hard fork** is a state of existence outside of any contract. The one's with the biggest guns win, regardless of whether they are correct. **It&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;war;** may those on the other side go fuck themselves.
* As [has pointed out]( it's not at all clear, really, that the original plan implies, say, Gavin's solution:
    &gt; You talk a lot about the creator of the system, but you haven't spoken to him-- and I doubt you know what he'd think about today. He was no fool on time based temporary limits, having -- in fact-- coded ones into the software (e.g. the change to introduce checksums into the version handshake was pre-staged with a two year timer on it); had the system's creator intended it to just be like that for the block size it could have been; and if that party though their name ought to be invoked here presumably they'd invoke it themselves rather than have you continually do so without their consent... Ultimately: It makes perfect sense to change how block limits work, when the system has the capacity handle it, no disagreements on that one; but it cannot handle the things done by some of these proposals (even if 8MB is debatable; 8192MB is not; and trends have weight in discussion but aren't natural law-- doubly so exponential ones).

The success of Augur does indeed depend on the success of Ethereum, a project which is not only a generalization of Bitcoin's concepts, but introduces new ideas that have yet to be tested.
I haven't followed Ethereum much, but one thing I thought the project was supposed to have gotten right was scalability; thus, I was surprised by [this comment](

You should see what happens when someone receives $5 worth of bitcoin, tries to send $2.5 to his son, and then immediately after, send the remaining $2.5^- change to his daughter. "What? It's been 30 minutes, and I still cannot send a lousy $2.5?" (you know, "variance" and all).
That is only a problem because of transaction malleability; otherwise, it would be perfectly acceptable to chain a series of unconfirmed transactions.

Bitcoin is an incremental, evolutionary, iterative improvement to the world's technologies; it takes a bunch of already existing, ingenious parts off the shelf and combines them in a pretty straightforward way. In fact, the software was a complete mess in the beginning, and it *still* looks like junk.
What makes Satoshi a genius is that he apparently used a pseudonym from the very beginning, and has successfully vanished without a trace.

If *only* there were some mechanism by which miners could transmit information about the costs of their service, and users could transmit information about how much they value that service, then it would be possible to find an equilibrium that satisfies both parties!
If *only* the market were somehow... hmmm... *free* enough to find that sweet spot through trial-and-error, through an iterative approach the homes in on at least a local efficiency, if not the global efficiency.
I wonder if this *Free Market* idea could ever catch on?
* As tirelessly points out, the fee market is a fucking wreck, so that needs to be fixed.
* However, to *your* point, a fee market doesn't guarantee that a solution will be found, because the solution might be too expensive for users: In that case, miners are going to have to improve their product (**hard&amp;nbsp;fork**? [*No!*]( if they intend to maintain income growth; that is, miners are going to have to offer cheaper transactions through some innovation, perhaps by increasing the block size (depending on the characteristics of their hardware, such as the Internet), or perhaps by developing overlays like the Lightening Network, or perhaps by developing more efficient mining hardware (which won't decrease congestion, but may improve income), or likely some combination of all these things, etc.
The problem here is that the market mechanisms are broken by bad, authoritarian design. The market is not free enough to *find* a more efficient **solution that meets all of the requirements** (PoW security, cheap fees, decentralization, etc.).
The market for fees is broken; that needs to be fixed first.

As Cyprus and perhaps Greece and numerous other cases throughout history have shown, that's about as good as asking the guy to send you a photo of himself holding 50'000 euros in cash.
If you're going to trust a neutral third-party, then you might as well formalize that trust further in the form of a multisignature cryptographic arrangement, something that your fucking bank can't do. A timelock transaction could prove very useful, as well.

Surely there are also other criteria that can be used for increasing the sense of correctness of a pruned tree; for instance, if a block contains only transactions that haven't been spent in 1000 years, then surely it's relatively safe for most people to assume that the UTXOs are *never* going to be spent.

Don't forget that we are discussing a hypothetic feature: To obfuscate what's going on even more by having a client send fake notification transactions at random times to at least one's own notification address and possibly to other notification addresses.
The "practical" way for a bureaucrat to fuck you over is to set policy and then precedent for punishing a person solely for running software that implements these random, fake notifications that we have been discussing; the goal of the bureaucrat is to establish that it is a criminal act (or civil offense) to run (if not just possess) such configured software.
Even if that policy and precedent is rarely used, it would be enough to hack away further at the *convention* that is privacy; people are unthinking animals, and must be shown the best way to exist through defaults (a libertarian merely avoids the possible tyrannies this implies by emphasizing that defaults should be alterable).

Yes, and in that case, Bitcoin miners are going to have to improve their product if they intend to maintain income growth; that is, miners are going to have to offer cheaper transactions through some innovation, perhaps by increasing the block size (depending on the characteristics of their hardware, such as the Internet), or perhaps by developing overlays like the Lightening Network, or perhaps by developing more efficient mining hardware (which won't decrease congestion, but may improve income), or likely some combination of all these things, etc.

1. A "side" chain can be embedded into the "main" chain until enough nodes are available to provide independent security without the overhead of embedding.
2. Changing the consensus rules is already the same as shoving everybody over to a "side" chain, and so it has the same concern that it's untested.
    At least with a 2-way "side" chain, there is a well defined path to escape to the old system.

Apology accepted!


* Increasing the block size *possibly* damages *at&amp;nbsp;least* one desired property of Bitcoin: Decentralization of mining power; this has to do with the current state of hardware, and so that damage may be mitigated over time as hardware improves, yet it is not clear *now* that it's a good idea to change the limit, and its even less clear exactly *how* that limit should be changed.
    *NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE WHAT THE BEST APPROACH SHOULD BE, AND EVERYONE IS AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO FUCK UP THE EXPERIMENT!*
    **What do we do when nobody knows for sure? We run more experiments!** We leave it to the market to decide, so that the market converges on a workable solution (not necessarily the *best*) with as little loss as possible.
    * A hard fork does not meet that requirement, and setting the precedent of using hard forks to make such changes irrevocably damages Bitcoin's property of having a predictable history; precedent will mean that there will always be the threat of an unstable history.
        * So, to avoid a hard fork means to use a soft fork, or to invent a new currency with the new properties. A soft fork will not work in cases such as increasing the limit on the block size, so a new currency must be created instead.
            The trick is to couple the new currency to the old currency in a predictable way; for a traditional example, a government may create a new currency and then tell everybody that he needs to exchange his old currency at a particular exchange rate. This is what a **sidechain** allows for cryptocurrencies, and because anybody can create a sidechain, **this approach opens up the problem to the free market, just as desired!**
            Logic has made the path clear: The sidechain is the suitable path forward now and *forever!*

How is it possible that you so misunderstood what I wrote?
Let me distill it down for you:
* The most free market possible is what's desired, as long as it also meets the desired requirements of Bitcoin (PoW security, cheap fees, decentralization, predictable history, etc.).
* Currently, we don't have a very free market.
* However, a hard fork is very bad policy, because it destroys one of the desired properties of Bitcoin: predictable history. It probably destroys other properties, too.

* At the time, the very extraordinarily simple notion of evolution by variation and selection was not only discounted as absurd, but was constructed by 2 people independently; Darwin was forced to publish his work in order to beat the other guy to it.
There is so very little that is not just a consequence of our times.
In our times: Git (merkel trees, decentralized control, and cryptographically protected histories), bittorrent (bootstrapping p2p networks and running them efficiently), hashcash (anti-spam core of Bitcoin), mature understanding of digital signatures, financial crises and the rise of libertarian economics and politics, a worldwide Internet, suffciently distributed computing, mobile computing, expectation of mobile payments systems... the very way Bitcoin works (connecting two pieces of a puzzle to verify a transaction) is similar to ancient monetary systems.

* You can simply classify full nodes as "accessible" and "inaccessible". Maybe there are 6k accessible full nodes right now, but 94k inaccessible full nodes, and therefore 100k total full nodes. That's a lot of nodes that can all of a sudden become accessible in a crisis, or when some new technology makes people feel more comfortable allowing incoming connections.

As always, you're such an idiot.
* RBF allows a person to retransmit his transaction with a higher fee; this allows a person to broadcast exactly how much he values having his transaction get put into the blockchain (the more you value expediency, the higher the fee you're willing to pay).
    Under RBF, you get what you pay for, and you don't get stuck with a bad bid; this allows the market to find the right price for getting into the blockchain under *existing* conditions (like, say, with a 1 MiB block).
* However, it's possible that no solution is valid with RBF alone: If it becomes too expensive to get into the blockchain in a reasonable amount of time, then people will stop using Bitcoin. That means miners will stop seeing income growth. That means miner's will be forced to improve their product. That means miners will be forced to do something like increase the block size in order to accomodate transactions at a cheaper price.
    In this way, the market settles on the optimal parameters (e.g., the optimal block size) for running the network.
The free market, you statist fool.

Not so. An empty block still secures that much more all of the transactions that already exist in the blockchain; for you, they may be a waste, but for someone else, they're another confirmation. Of course, the same can be said for a block that is filled with transactions other than your own.

It will be considered a matter of international trade, let alone interstate trade, over which the Federal Congress has explicit and basically infinite power to construct draconian, invasive laws.
Consequently, Congress will take the operation of a store in the OpenBazaar market as being well within its jurisdiction, and proceed to require registration of any such business under pain of federal prosecution of a felony charge, including steep fines and possibly jail time; certainly, there will be dire consequences for those people who sell pots and pans and the like to people in sanctioned regions such as Iran. The federal government will work with their trading allies to implement the same laws in other countries, and even set up extradition rules for stores that sell to Americans without the proper registration as an "international merchant".
Ebay and Amazon and even Overstock will help draft the legislation necessary to make this a reality, and will spare no expense in lobbying Congress to pass it, because Open Bazaar represents a real threat to large portions of their income.
There will be a few high-profile cases of both domestic and international store owners operating on OB being prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and this will drastically reduce otherwise "legitimate" activity on the network.
The only people left operating on OB will be the black market sorts, dealing in the same things that are dealt in the current dark markets, and the Federal government will be content that this is so, for they now have a justification for the continuation of the perpetual drug war.

After all, while everyone else scoffed at Bitcoin, those early adopters saw promise, or at least something interesting; should they not be rewarded for their insight? If Bitcoin turns out successful, won't those early adopters (especially hodlers) have proved themselves better at allocating capital than *you*, who stuck up your nose and breathed laughter through your nostrils?

* A bitcoin transaction is sent and received as quickly as an email.
    However, transaction is only truly meaningful when it's embedded in a block that is itself embedded in the blockchain. Each new block added to the blockchain buries the previous blocks in the blockchain, confirming that much more the correctness of those blocks' transactions.
    So, if you're selling a coffee for $5, you can probably feel pretty safe trusting just the transaction without waiting for a block to be confirmed.
    However, if you're selling $1000 of gold, then you'll probably want to wait for at least 1 block, and probably 6 blocks, after which it would be nearly impossible to change the transaction history.
    It's a game of probablities; choose your desired risk.
    In any case, waiting for 6 blocks (that is, waiting for approximately 1 hour on average) is *nothing*. Credit Cards and other payment methods can be reversed weeks later.
* Other payment schemes that don't use the blockchain for every transaction are also possible, but it's too early to tell how that might be set up.

The "[informal economy]( represents something like 2/3 of the global economy; it includes the [black market]( in which an estimated 1.8 billion people participate, whose activities represent an estimated 1.829 *trillion* US dollars worth of annual market value.
That is to say, regulation is *already* pointless; among certain schools of thought, regulation serves merely to line the pockets of officials and to protect cronies from competition. Indeed, the black markets prove that people are not helped by regulation, because they would rather break the law than submit to it.
So, regulation will be used by governments to fill their coffers, and it will be used by organizations like Coinbase and Circle to stamp out competition. Yet, this will only drive people into the black markets, and once there are enough closed loops in the Bitcoin economy, the gray markets will flourish anyway.
Moreover, whereas regulation is necessarily local, cryptocurrencies are necessarily global; thus, regulation will only push the benefits of a cryptocurrency out of one jurisdiction and into another. If New York regulates Bitcoin companies with a heavy hand, but London does not, then companies will set their headquarters in London, and happily service the rest of the world.
Regulation almost never generates wealth; if some "regulatory" action were profitable, then it would emerge on its own, without imposition. This is why the Internet functons: Standards are naturally adopted when they reduce friction and thus increase profits. 
Because of this fact, there are never enough resources to scale regulation beyond attacking the offendors who are most egregious, or who are the most centralized.
* It's easy to topple [e-gold]( and make an example of its founder by threatening him with decades of captivity in a cage, but that's not a possibility with Bitcoin.
* It's easy to shut down a prediction market like [Intrade]( but how will you shutdown [Augur]( or one of the other implementations of [Truthcoin](
**Decentralized systems such as cryptocurrencies perceive imposed regulation as damage, and like the Internet, they route around that damage.**
Those are my ***8*** cents.

* What do you mean by "default"? It has often been the state's law that the first born son inherits an estate, etc., even if the previous owner of the estate wished someone else to inherit it. The value in such a law is that it prevents power from leaving a family, especially by bribery.
    Yet, that's not capitalism, as it takes the power of appropriation away from the supposed owner of the estate.

* To annihilate others is to appropriate others' capital; that's clearly not allowed under capitalism, so this point of yours is irrelevant.
* The fact that you're worried about the treatment of the less fortunate is proof that support for them would naturally emerge; that's why there have always been charitable organizations, educational organizations, etc.
    That the government takes its stolen loot and uses some meagre amount of it to fund pseudo-charitable services, etc., does not mean that government is necessary or even optimal for handling the situation of the less fortunate; certainly, it is less likely that you'll end up with useful solutions when a player like the government decrees itself a monopoly in this domain, and takes people's resources, which could be employed better otherwise.
* The aristocracy of long ago were not capitalists; they were government; they were proponents of involuntary trade, forcing people to allocate their capital to their own will; they are not a good example for your case, but rather a good example for mine.
    Yet, would you not agree that the son of a duke was likely going to be more capable of managing his deceased father's estate than the illiterate, superstitious peasants?
    The priniples of capitalism that managed to exist in the society of the time are what led to enough wealth to afford the education of some of the commonfolk to the point where they, too, were able to prove themselves as capable as (if not more so than) the aristocrats in managing society's capital.
    Let's say a butcher's son becomes a billionaire industrialist through strictly voluntary trade, and chooses to leave his wealth to his *second* son (after all, this industrialist believes his first son would not manage the accrued capital very well; that is, this industrialist has made a decision about how best to allocate his capital). Why would you think State bureaucrats would be better stewards of this wealth, rather than the person chosen by the man who made this wealth in the first place? Why would vote-grabbing politicians voted in by ridiculous promises to the illiterate, know-nothing masses be a better choice as benefactors to this inheritance? Why would it be better to dismantle brick-by-brick the empire that took a lifetime to build, and then just scatter these pieces to the winds of decentralized self-interest?
* In the long term, voluntary trade puts the control of resources into the hands of those who have proven themselves good at allocating resources.

In any case, I suppose that a project could simply run a new crowdfunding project for each milestone. However, I fantasize about the following:
* Having a large project entirely funded up-front, but whose funds are only accessible when milestones are voted in a decentralized way as having been completed.
* At any time, the backers can also vote in a decentralized way to have the as-yet unclaimed portion of the funds returned.
In this way:
* A project gets a good signal about long-term support.
* Backers feel there is safety in numbers for the duration off the project.

Ergo, the network is the third party; it's just like Visa or Mastercard, except that the organization that processes your transaction is hopefully decentralized enough to be above the influence of any special interest.
The premise of Bitoin is that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though it doesn't guarantee it.
Further exacerbating the issue is the fact that the mining industry is going to be rapidly losing its income over the next several years. Right now, some miners are complaining that even 1&amp;nbsp;MB blocks are too large, even while [the whole mining industry is currently getting paid the equivalent of *completely&amp;nbsp;full* 80&amp;nbsp;MB blocks at 4&amp;nbsp;U.S.&amp;nbsp;cents per transaction](
Furthermore, increasing the block size damages that design for decentralization; of course, some centralization might be a good tradeoff if it yields a much more usable system, but it's clear that growing the block size is a pretty damn limited solution in that regard, and there needs to be something like the Lightning Network to abstract from Bitcoin the duties of currency, thereby allowing enough users to fund a sufficiently decentralized mining industry.
**TL;DR:** The Bitcoin network is a third party, and unfortunately, that third party is becoming more centralized, but fortunately, it's possible to prevent it from becoming too centralized as long as the right financial incentives are maintained.

An altcoin is a blockchain system operating under rules of consensus that are incompatible with those of Bitcoin; that everyone might adopt those rules and then call the new rules "Bitcoin" is irrelevant.

[Here's the bank's actual blog post]( it's almost as if someone replaced every occurrence of "Bitcoin" with "Blockchain", but it also makes sense, because what's important is the collection of concepts, not the most successful implementation to date.
* I think this is how it will play out: Blockstream will create a number of blockchain systems that are specifically useful to banks, but these systems won't supply their own unique tokens; instead, you'll have to send your BTC tokens to these systems through what's called a 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg, and in this way, you'll be able to do interesting and even proprietary things with your BTC that you cannot do with just plain Bitcoin—and more importantly, you can transfer those tokens *back* to Bitcoin when you're finished.
    For instance, Blockstream's [Alpha]( sidechain offers "confidential&amp;nbsp;transactions", which don't allow onlookers to see exactly how much value has been transferred, which is very appealing to banks.
    The problem is that right now Bitcoin doesn't support 2-way&amp;nbsp;pegs, so Blockstream has developed a method that anybody can use to get things started: The Federated Peg, which is a centralized (but still distributed) federation of computers that handle the business of enforcing a 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg; such a federation would be perfect for a consortium of competing banks, for instance.
    In the future, it might be somehow worthwhile to "outsource" the business of securing the sidechain to anybody else in the world, and so such a system could transition from a federation to merged mining if the hashrate is high enough, but then fall back on a federation if the hashrate falls too low.
    The 2-way peg could be outsourced in this way by having Bitcoin handle it, but that would require Bitcoin to be altered with a soft fork; of course, if Bitcoin ever reintroduces the programmatic features that Satoshi removed for fear of them being too powerful, then a decentralized 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg could be implemented as a smart contract.
* Now, why in particular would all of this be useful to banks? Well, people like standards; they want one tool and one system—one that is well defined with characteristics about which one can reason.
    Blockchain data structures excel at allowing immense and widespread auditing with few resources, and frankly, that's what banking and notaries and the like are all about.
    For instance, git (which also uses Merkle trees to create an increasingly secure record of events, just like Bitcoin) allows disparate people—even&amp;nbsp;enemies—to come to *consensus* about the correct history of very complex projects; the same could be done with a ledger, and that is why it's useful to the financial world.
    In a way, the rest of the world is starting to wake up to modern practices of source code management, *and* the benefit of taking authority over that management out of any one party's hands.

Transaction volume *must* grow for Bitcoin to be workable, but doing so through blocks of an increased size is *not* sufficient! So, what now? You'd like to cause a hard fork for a solution that is in fact *not* a solution, **and** which may have a deleterious effect on network topology at this point in time?
**It's simple arithmetic, folks!**
"[Our analysis]( indicates that for compensation per block to remain constant after the next halving event, fees would have to increase to ~$4.6 per transaction (from 4 cents today) if transaction volumes and \[BTC\] price remain unchanged."
Of course, such fees will never happen. Instead, the BTC price will probably rise, and the mining industry will probably shrink ([see here]( as time goes by, the price will rise less and less, and the mining industry will shrink more and more.
Hopefully, transaction *volume* can increase to spread the costs across more people.
It should be noted that according to [the same analysis of real-world data]( "the average bitcoin transaction data size has grown to roughly 600 bytes".
Thus, in a *completely&amp;nbsp;full* **100&amp;nbsp;MB block**, you could get 166666 transactions of an average nature; that's 277.8 transactions per second. In contrast, [Visa handles]( an average of 2000 transactions per second, and a peak capacity of 56&amp;nbsp;000 transactions per second!
What's worse is that even a 100&amp;nbsp;MB block is completely out of the question, unless you don't mind the possibility of extreme centralization, especially given that [the mining industry is already being paid the equivalent of a completely full 80&amp;nbsp;MB block]( (with an average transaction fee of 4&amp;nbsp;U.S.&amp;nbsp;cents) and yet whine about an increase in the block size from 1&amp;nbsp;MB, *and* are about to see a significant loss in their income due to the halving of the block reward.
Lifting the block-size limit is a hard fork; it is the equivalent of telling everybody to switch to an unproven, conflicting altcoin, and even if that switch is successful, there are not enough users to make completely full 80 MB blocks anyway, and if there were enough users, the burden of such large blocks might well have a deleterious effect on the topology of the network.
Transactions must be consolidated by a standardized overlay network, and placed into Bitcoin as a settlement transaction; the occasional power user may, of&amp;nbsp;course, place a transaction directly into Bitcoin's blockchain if desired—after all, it's far more important to secure a collection of 100 thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee.
The calculations show that time and energy are only worthwhile when put into figuring out the transaction consolidation network, because increasing the block size is a tactic that is about as close to useless as can be imagined—*and* it will cause a hard fork!

For instance, maybe the service was engineered to provide a certain bandwidth based on some kind of normal usage which doesn't include constantly streaming P2P services 24/7; in that case, you're probably underpaying, and therefore being subsidized by your neighbor who just wants to stream Netflix once a night. Or, perhaps you and your neighbor are both overpaying, getting a network that provides way more connectivity than either requires in practice, etc., and therefore you're just lining the pockets of the ISP.

It starts out with a very promising motivation:




@_date: 2015-08-12 17:27:37
* You are trying too little here; just riddle me this: Why strangle Bitcoin with an untested, unproven alteration to the fundamental consensus rules that have hitherto been fairly successful, and why do so when there are far more sophisticated solutions to consider? Why propose a contract and then proceed to break it, rather than at least try to work within it?
    What you are proposing is natural only in the sense that history is replete with examples of powerful idiots—be they dictators or mobs proles—breaking the existing contracts for what they think (often erroneously) benefits them.
    The core rules should be set in an unbreakable manner, and further extensions allowed only as ***opt-in*** features; that is how you achieve decentralization and a natural evolution by variation and selection toward the best solutions.
    What is the value of Bitcoin if at any moment, the economic majority can snap its fingers and say they want to change the game? Next, you might be seeing the dismantling of sacred constants, like the 21&amp;nbsp;million BTC cap—your hard fork for a block size will set the precedent, and [don't think it's impossible](
    A hard fork is philosophically repugnant, and is a sign that the system is fundamentally flawed and in need of very deep thinking, so that a hard fork can be made absolutely worthwhile.
* I don't understand this connection that people keep trying to make between developing sidechains or the lightning network, and holding up the debate on the block size limit, especially this whining about "profit motive" and "sabotage".
    Even without those concepts, the problems with a hard&amp;nbsp;fork and centralization remain.
    So, it seems to me that there are indeed 2 groups:
    * People with the right ideas, grappling with hard questions, trying to set a solid foundation for Bitcoin.
    * People who have no idea what they're talking about, have watched too many movies where magical superheroes solve all problems by cletching their fists and grunting hard enough, and are grasping at the simplest and stupidest solutions because those are the only ones they can comprehend.
    That's the story of human history.

The overarching project is called "Sidechain Elements"; the sidechain about which you are talking is called "Alpha".
[Here is the project on GitHub](
Alpha is a kind of re-imagining of Bitcoin, tempered by much more advanced cryptography and years of insight into Bitcoin's bugs and missing features. For instance, it offers confidential transactions, the removal of transaction malleability, n-of-n signatures that are as efficient as 1-of-1 signatures, Counterparty-like features, etc.
What's interesting is that a nascent sidechain could start off with a Fed-Peg, and then transition to only merge-mining given a sufficient hashrate, and then transition back to a Fed-Peg if the hashrate fell too much, etc., making it possible to construct an experimental system until it's self sufficient.
As an aside, note that a 2-way peg can already be implemented with a semi-trusted federation of servers, and that it could be implemented in a more decentralized way with a soft-fork change to Bitcoin; alternatively, if Bitcoin ever reintroduces the more sophisticated script operations that Satoshi removed for fear of being too powerul, then a 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg could be implemented as a smart contract without any special treatment.

* &gt; This is a *major* change.
    There is no change; it's an additional layer on top of Bitcoin—use it, or don't. Regardless, at least you can be certain that the rules to which you agreed are not going to change in the middle of the game.
    &gt;  This will be much harder to implement than simply increasing the blocksize.
    That's a good point... *except that increasing the block size is patently useless as revealed by basic arithmetic!*
* &gt; In this case, bitcoin is still bitcoin, but the 1MB evangelists will be clinging to a now defunct altcoin.
    We'll see how you feel when the economic majority decides that an endless low-level block&amp;nbsp;reward is the only sure way to fund a sufficient mining industry...
    Enjoy clinging to your now defunct altcoin, you 21M evangelist.
* &gt;  The more profitable mining becomes (do to less and less miners), the the more people will jump on the bandwagon.
    That's a contradiction: The fewer miners there are, the more miners there will be.
    The miner's are about to lose half of their income; something must change drastically, especially given that the mining industry is already considered highly competitive and fairly centralized. [See here]( these are the following solutions: the BTC&amp;nbsp;price could rise, the transaction fees could rise, the number of transactions could rise, the 21&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;BTC cap could be broken, or some combination of those.
    The assumption is that users are unwilling to support much of an increase in transaction fees; and, a rising BTC&amp;nbsp;price is only useful as long as there is a block reward; and, even if there is enough interest to warrant a sufficiently growing volume of transactions across which to spread the costs (there isn't), an increasing block size is not a sufficient solution to handle it.

Perhaps [see here]( for a clarification.
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:50:07
"[Our analysis]( indicates that for compensation per block to remain constant after the next halving event, fees would have to increase to ~$4.6 per transaction (from 4 cents today) if transaction volumes and \[BTC\] price remain unchanged."
Of course, such fees will never happen. Instead, the BTC price will rise, and the mining industry will probably shrink; as time goes by, the price will rise less and less, and the mining industry will shrink more and more.
Hopefully, transaction *volume* can increase to spread the costs across more people.
It should be noted that according to [the same analysis of real-world data]( "the average bitcoin transaction data size has grown to roughly 600 bytes".
Thus, in a *completely&amp;nbsp;full* **100&amp;nbsp;MB block**, you could get 166666 transactions of an average nature; that's 277.8 transactions per second. In contrast, [Visa handles]( an average of 2000 transactions per second, and a peak capacity of 56&amp;nbsp;000 transactions per second!
What's worse is that even a 100&amp;nbsp;MB block is completely out of the question, unless you don't mind the possibility of extreme centralization, especially given that [the mining industry is already being paid the equivalent of a completely full 80&amp;nbsp;MB block]( and yet whine about an increase in the block size from 1&amp;nbsp;MB, *and* are about to see a significant loss in their income due to the halving of the block reward.
Lifting the block-size limit is a hard fork; it is the equivalent of telling everybody to switch to an unproven, conflicting altcoin, and even if that switch is successful, there are not enough users to make completely full 80 MB blocks anyway, and if there were enough users, the burden of such large blocks might well have a deleterious effect on the topology of the network.
Transactions must be consolidated by a standardized overlay network, and placed into Bitcoin as a settlement transaction; the occasional power user may, of&amp;nbsp;course, place a transaction directly into Bitcoin's blockchain if desired—after all, it's far more important to secure a collection of 100 thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee.

That is incredibly wrong.
The assumption of Bitoin is merely that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or catastrophically incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though it doesn't guarantee it.
That is, Bitcoin is designed on the assumption that the collection of miners is dominated by general interests (as opposed to a special interest), and that the hashrate is sufficiently high to prevent any special interest from gaining significant authority. **General interests, typically, aren't too sophisticated, and they become dumber as a mob mentality is fomented.**
If anything, Bitcoin is based on the assumption that the original ideas of Bitcoin are pretty darn smart and that a bunch of independent people are too disorganized to collude to change the rules easily.
@_date: 2015-08-24 18:04:34
* &gt; The mining majority always sets the rules
    You are proposing majority rule.
    Yet, Bitcoin isn't about majority rule; rather, Bitcoin is about **decentralization** of power.
    --------
    The premise of Bitcoin is merely that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or catastrophically incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though, as you point out, Bitcoin's design doesn't guarantee it.

    So, for Bitcoin to be sufficiently decentralized, Bitcoin must be managed by enough people such that they are too disorganized to effect much change. Otherwise, what's the point of Bitcoin?
* &gt; The Bitcoin Core approach isn't just boring and perceptive, it's also untenable.
    You are not listening.
    Bitcoin (the system) cannot do *everything* that people want to do with BTC; so, the solution is to make your own system that is usable with BTC through a 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg.
    That is, the solution is not to create your own token, but rather to use Bitcoin's token; this doesn't detach BTC from Bitcoin's blockchain, but rather this attaches your blockchain to BTC.
    I think this is how it will play out: Blockstream will create a number of blockchain systems that are specifically useful to banks, but these systems won't supply their own unique tokens; instead, you'll have to send your BTC tokens to these systems through what's called a 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg, and in this way, you'll be able to do interesting and even proprietary things with your BTC that you cannot do with just plain Bitcoin—and more importantly, you can transfer those tokens *back* to Bitcoin when you're finished, thereby escaping the dangers of some other network; this is what people mean by "The Internet of Money".
    For instance, Blockstream's [Alpha]( sidechain offers "confidential&amp;nbsp;transactions", which don't allow onlookers to see exactly how much value has been transferred, which is very appealing to banks.
    Furthermore:
    * Losing miners possibly reduces the participants with general interests.
    * Losing hashrate lowers the barrier to authority.
    How do you ensure that the population of people who maintain the Bitcoin system (miners, etc.) is sufficiently decentralized?
    What is the minimum hashrate required to keep it sufficiently decentralized? That is, what is the minimum hashrate require to keep any special interest from gaining significant authority?
    How do you communicate to everybody what that minimum hashrate is? How do you get people to pay enough to keep that minimum hashrate? For example, after the next halving, etc., will the hashrate still be above that minimum?
    That is, you cannot just increase the block size willy nilly; a sufficient hashrate is not something that you can just mandate, and disturbing the system as it currently works should not be taken lightly.
* Bitcoin must be scaled in order to be self-sustaining; the volume of transactions must grow tremendously in order for Bitcoin usage to be **both cheap and secure**.
    However, one data center for processing Visa transactions was handling at&amp;nbsp;least [2500&amp;nbsp;transactions per second]( in the year *2012*; at an average of [600&amp;nbsp;bytes per transaction]( that would require a 900&amp;nbsp;MB&amp;nbsp;block in Bitcoin. [According to Visa]( VisaNet can handle 56&amp;nbsp;000 transactions per second, which would require a 20.160&amp;nbsp;***G***B block, yet don't we want Bitcoin to be *much* more pervasive than Visa? Upping the block size just does not bring on the kind of scale that we all desire.
    So, regardless of your view on how big blocks should be, a consolidation of transactions (e.g., the Lightning Network) is ultimately the only reasonable option for scaling Bitcoin that we can start working on right now.
    After all, it's more important to secure 100 thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee. Go ahead; stick your coffee purchase in the settlement layer (Bitcoin) directly if you want, but you won't want to do so, because that's insane; there is no point in storing that one transaction for all time in a highly secure record.
@_date: 2015-08-12 16:40:19
However, [I do consider]( the original Bitcoin to be an altcoin compared to the version of Bitcoin that exists now... so... try again?
**These are technical matters; there's nothing to argue about.**
Under your thinking, you wouldn't consider it an altcoin if a hard&amp;nbsp;fork got rid of the 21&amp;nbsp;million BTC cap, and replaced it with a low-level 2%, endless inflation.
An altcoin is a blockchain system operating under rules of consensus that are incompatible with those of Bitcoin; that everyone might adopt those rules and then call the new rules "Bitcoin" is irrelevant.
That is why a hard&amp;nbsp;fork *is* an altcoin; it's also why a sidechain is *not* an altcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:30:42
You don't know what you're talking about and should therefore remain quiet.
The Lightning Network (not "lightening") is based on something called a "payment channel", which provides users with a way of consolidating a bunch of ***Bitcoin*** transactions into just one final ***Bitcoin*** transaction; people are still using ***Bitcoin*** in the end, and have just as much control over their settled coins as they ever did.
To scale to the level of Visa on a *slow* day in a moderately sized city, blocks would need to be 900&amp;nbsp;MB, and on a *fast* day globally, around 20&amp;nbsp;***G***B, and yet you want Bitcoin to be bigger and more pervasive than Visa, amirite? Right now, without a block reward, to keep the same transactions fees and income for the mining industry, Bitcoin would have to be producing 80&amp;nbsp;MB blocks that are completely full.
Regardless of what you think about block sizes, the only way to keep Bitcoin cheap and secure is through a high volume of transactions via a transaction-consolidation network like the Lightning Network.
@_date: 2015-08-07 03:55:49
What's being discussed here is a method for allowing various blockchain systems to communicate; in particular, that method is basically a 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg, whereby the tokens of one system are pegged to the tokens of another system, and therefore the tokens are transferable between the 2 systems.
That method is open to anybody to use.
A system that uses it, however, could be completely proprietary.

* &gt; The arbitrary 1MB blocksize will significantly limit me from doing this in a timely fashion.
    Why, because it's too expensive? Well, why are you trying to use a settlement network to purchase your coffee? *That's&amp;nbsp;insane!*
    More on the matter of expense: After the next halving of the block reward, you're going to have to pay a transaction fee that is on average approximately $4.6. Of course, that won't be necessary if USD/BTC nearly doubles *or* you're fine with significant shrinking and probably centralization of the mining industry...

Firstly, I'm not associated with Blockstream.
Secondly, if you downvoted my comment, then for the love of discussion and all things holy on reddit, please undo that downvote.
While the Lightening Network and sidechains are still in early development, that development does not jeopardize the Bitcoin system; in contrast, for all of the reasons already listed, increasing the block size, however, *does* directly jeopardize the Bitcoin system.
Like so many, you seem to be confusing what you're thinking with what's actually written; *nobody*—and I mean *nobody*—is saying that Bitcoin's block size limit should never be changed.
Rather, what is being said is that there is *not&amp;nbsp;yet* clear consensus on what growth in the block size would be acceptably safe, and that in any case, a hard&amp;nbsp;fork even when there is consensus is pretty much an *idiot*'s approach to upgrading a supposedly decentralized system.
@_date: 2015-08-12 18:41:25
* That's why you see updating the rules as being worthwhile. However, updating the rules, it turns out, is very problematic. If changing the limit didn't require a hard fork, and if it were obvious to what the limit should be changed, then there would be no argument.
    You are ignoring the very real problems with your solution, and that is why you cannot understand the problem; you are refusing to acknowledge the problems.
* The limit was put in place via a soft fork.

Who is to say that a given hashrate is high enough to actually secure the network from the meddling of a special interest?
Indeed, what is the *minimum* hashrate required to secure the network? After the next block-reward halving, will the mining industry *still* produce a hashrate that is above that minimum?
How can you communicate to the users of Bitcoin what this minimum hashrate is? Who is going to pay for maintaining that minimum hashrate, and how will they pay?
@_date: 2015-08-06 21:41:50
You're not arguing with me. You're arguing with somebody in your head.
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:23:56
You cannot just mandate security; you cannot just mandate a hashrate; *somebody* has to pay for it, and right now *everybody* who holds BTC is paying for it via the block reward. The mining industry is currently being paid the equivalent of creating *completely&amp;nbsp;full* 80&amp;nbsp;MB blocks with a transaction fee of 4&amp;nbsp;US&amp;nbsp;cents per average transaction.
Yet, that block reward is rapidly going away, which means the mining industry's compensation is rapidly going away.
* Losing miners possibly reduces the participants with general interests.
* Losing hashrate lowers the barrier to authority for special interests.
How do you ensure that the population of people who maintain the Bitcoin system (miners, etc.) is sufficiently decentralized?
What is the minimum hashrate required to keep it sufficiently decentralized? That is, what is the minimum hashrate required to keep any special interest from gaining significant authority?
How do you communicate to everybody what that minimum hashrate is? How do you get people to pay enough to keep that minimum hashrate? For example, after the next halving, etc., will the hashrate still be above that minimum?
The premise of Bitcoin is merely that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or catastrophically incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, thought Bitcoin's design doesn't guarantee it.
That is, Bitcoin is designed on the assumption that the collection of miners is dominated by general interests (as opposed to a special interest), and that the hashrate is sufficiently high to prevent any special interest from gaining significant authority.
General interests, typically, aren't too sophisticated, and they become dumber as a mob mentality is fomented. If anything, Bitcoin is based on the assumption that the original ideas of Bitcoin are pretty darn smart and that a bunch of independent people are too disorganized to collude to change the rules easily.
So, for Bitcoin to be sufficiently decentralized, Bitcoin must be managed by enough people such that they are too disorganized to effect much change. You cannot mandate that; people must have a strong incentive. Otherwise, what's the point of Bitcoin?
**The only way to keep Bitcoin both secure and cheap is to increase transaction volume. Unfortunately, increasing the block size scales very poorly, and is therefore not much of a long-term solution.**

Why should one group's opinion be forced upon the other?
Perhaps it would be valuable to *everyone* to have a kind of hierarchy of opt-in blockchain systems that provide varying degrees of security and usability, thereby allowing the market to find the optimal usage of each.
Consider something like [extension blocks]( which is an idea related to sidechains; they would allow for small-blockers and big-blockers to exist in parallel, each system feeding off the virtues of the other.
That is, whole issue should just be avoided by keeping discordant consensus systems (ones that together would initiate a fork) *explicitly* separate, at most linked only *explicitly* through something like a 2-way peg, or maybe extension blocks, or possibly [subchains]( etc.
There's *much* more creative discussion to be had; there are to be considered *much* more sophisticated solutions than the ones that, as&amp;nbsp;usual, the mob has adopted.

Don't forget that we're talking about maintaining the current form of the mining industry; maintaining that form requires maintaining compensation for miners.
If BTC price increases, then users will reduce their transaction fees, such that miners won't see a change in compensation from transaction fees; the only increase in compensation that a miner will see is due to the block reward, which remains *fixed* regardless of BTC price.
So, to depend on an increased BTC price to maintain miner compensation is to depend on a block reward; yet, the block reward is ever diminishing and will one day disappear entirely&amp;hellip; *unless it doesn't.*

That may be so, however, the laws of reality will put a stop to their adventure: The Bitcoin network is nowhere close to being able to handle an adoption of such magnitude.
A working transaction-consolidation network must first be installed over Bitcoin before such adoption would even be worth considering; after all, it's far more important to secure a collection of 100&amp;nbsp;thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee.

I'm campaigning on behalf of interesting and persuasive ideas.
Your implication is that my thoughts and passions are completely dictated by the highest bidder; given that I would never draw a similar conclusion about someone else who is simply listing facts and contemplating conclusions, I have to wonder if you're somehow projecting your own modus operandi onto me...
Given the poor results of my campaigning, do you really think Blockstream would keep me in their employ?


* Maybe Satoshi did intend for another hard fork to fix block sizes—before Bitcoin was managing billions of dollars in assets, before the world was keeping close watch, and before anyone had even conceived of a more sophisticated way than a hard fork to update the overall system, such as 2-way pegged sidechains.
    I mean, hell, besides the fact that Satoshi isn't even here anymore, just consider that his "cleanest and simplest" solution is regarded as too unsophisticated today by even the Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT people, who want the switch to be determined by the presence of some proportion of blocks with a certain version.
* The whole issue should just be avoided by keeping discordant consensus systems (ones that together would initiate a hard fork) *explicitly* separate, at most linked only *explicitly* through something like a 2-way peg, or maybe [extension blocks]( or possibly [subchains]( etc. There's *much* more creative discussion to be had.
    Why should there ever be fear of a fork? Why should anyone ever be forced onto a system that has yet to prove itself?
    The only missing piece is figuring out objective criteria and an explicit protocol for pinching off a sidechain to become the "main" chain with as little disruption as possible—but even a hard fork to do so will be much more trivial, because the sidechain's functionality and acceptance will have been tested in the wild.

Maybe this post would be useful:
* [LPT: If a movie is too low during dialogues, use the VLC Dynamic Range Compressor to automatically adjust the volume.](
@_date: 2015-08-27 18:36:14
What's necessary is twofold:
* Scale the system.
* Keep it decentralized.
Those issues are deeply intertwined, and cannot be considered separately.
**You are correct:** Bitcoin must be scaled in order to be self-sustaining; the volume of transactions must grow tremendously in order for Bitcoin usage to be *both cheap and secure*.
However, one data center for processing Visa transactions was handling at&amp;nbsp;least [2500&amp;nbsp;transactions per second]( in the year *2012*; at an average of [600&amp;nbsp;bytes per transaction]( that would require a 900&amp;nbsp;MB&amp;nbsp;block in Bitcoin. [According to Visa]( VisaNet can handle 56&amp;nbsp;000 transactions per second, which would require a 20.160&amp;nbsp;***G***B block, yet don't we want Bitcoin to be *much* more pervasive than Visa? Upping the block size just does not bring on the kind of scale that we all desire.
So, regardless of your view on how big blocks should be, a consolidation of transactions (e.g., the Lightning Network) is ultimately the only reasonable option for scaling Bitcoin *meaningfully*. It also provides nice benefits, like decreased traceability.
After all, it's more important to secure 100 thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee. Go ahead; stick your coffee purchase in the settlement layer (Bitcoin) directly if you want, but you won't want to do so, because that's insane; there is no point in storing that one transaction for all time in a highly secure record.

There's no irony; the Lightning Network is neither being forced on anyone nor threatening the functioning of existing, working systems.

Your questions are irrelevant, and do not follow logically as a response; I did not suggest that such an overlay network already exists, but rather that one must exist in order for Bitcoin to be workable.
That being said, consider that ChangeTip is a kind of overlay network, and that each of Coinbase and Circle provides an overlay network, etc. These overlay networks exist, because Bitcoin is not always necessary or is sometimes utterly impractical without them, which the arithmetic suggests; Bitcoin is useful as the settlement layer, a fact that *will* eventually need to be abstracted out and made an official tier above Bitcoin—of course, there's no reason that your settled coins cannot be completely within your control as before.
There's no reason to store for all time a highly secure record of your single, personal coffee purchase this morning. Of course, if you can think of a reason why that would be valuable, then by all means, place your transaction directly within the Bitcoin settlement network if you so choose.
Altering the Bitcoin block size *limit* does not significantly improve the situation; indeed, it's not guaranteed to change anything, because the effective block size might be below the new limit. However, it *is* guaranteed to cause a hard fork, and it *is* guaranteed that bigger players will have a much increased advantage over smaller players.
@_date: 2015-08-02 23:17:45
Um... that is the very point of this entire post.
With regard to whether miner compensation should be kept at 25&amp;nbsp;BTC, that's the same as asking whether the current hashrate should be what it is.
It's been said many times that were all of the supercomputers on the planet to be repurposed as Bitcoin miners, their combined hashrate would be miniscule compared to that of the existing Bitcoin network; maybe, then, that implies there is *way* too much effort being put into securing the Bitcoin network, and the mining industry would do well to shrink, so that its capital could be put to other uses. The block reward has induced people to invest in mining.
Then again, what *is* the correct hashrate? If the hashrate falls too much, an adversary with very deep pockets could potentially make attacks against the network; how are you going to get users of Bitcoin to fork over the money required to build up defenses in the form of more honest hash power? Assuming people won't voluntarily increase their transaction fees, a tax in the form of a block reward is at least the easiest way, as proved by the extensive resources that have already been thrown into mining due to it.
@_date: 2015-08-27 18:47:22
So, there are 2 cases:
* **The blocksize limit is dire:**  
In that case, a hard&amp;nbsp;fork is necessary to keep the whole system running.
    However, maybe it's better to have a more conservative approach, like what Adam Back recently proposed: 2&amp;nbsp;MB now, 4&amp;nbsp;MB after 2 years more, 8&amp;nbsp;MB in 2 years thereafter, then we re-assess.
    In the meantime, we revert to the other case...
* **The blocksize limit is *not* dire:**  
We can work on a more robust framework like "extensions&amp;nbsp;blocks" for introducing further changes; the blocksize limit is but one of many possible disputes, so there should be a general way to approach finding a solution to *any* dispute in a decentralized fashion, and the blocksize limit dispute should be fixed within that generalized framework.

@_date: 2015-08-05 13:07:02
**It's simple arithmetic, folks!**
"[Our analysis]( indicates that for compensation per block to remain constant after the next halving event, fees would have to increase to ~$4.6 per transaction (from 4 cents today) if transaction volumes and \[BTC\] price remain unchanged."
Of course, such fees will never happen. Instead, the BTC price will rise, and the mining industry will probably shrink; as time goes by, the price will rise less and less, and the mining industry will shrink more and more.
Hopefully, transaction *volume* can increase to spread the costs across more people.
It should be noted that according to [the same analysis of real-world data]( "the average bitcoin transaction data size has grown to roughly 600 bytes".
Thus, in a *completely&amp;nbsp;full* **100&amp;nbsp;MB block**, you could get 166666 transactions of an average nature; that's 277.8 transactions per second. In contrast, [Visa handles]( an average of 2000 transactions per second, and a peak capacity of 56&amp;nbsp;000 transactions per second!
What's worse is that even a 100&amp;nbsp;MB block is completely out of the question, unless you don't mind the possibility of extreme centralization, especially given that [the mining industry is already being paid the equivalent of a completely full 80&amp;nbsp;MB block]( (with an average transaction fee of 4&amp;nbsp;U.S.&amp;nbsp;cents) and yet whine about an increase in the block size from 1&amp;nbsp;MB, *and* are about to see a significant loss in their income due to the halving of the block reward.
Lifting the block-size limit is a hard fork; it is the equivalent of telling everybody to switch to an unproven, conflicting altcoin, and even if that switch is successful, there are not enough users to make completely full 80 MB blocks anyway, and if there were enough users, the burden of such large blocks might well have a deleterious effect on the topology of the network.
Transactions must be consolidated by a standardized overlay network, and placed into Bitcoin as a settlement transaction; the occasional power user may, of&amp;nbsp;course, place a transaction directly into Bitcoin's blockchain if desired—after all, it's far more important to secure a collection of 100 thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee.
The calculations show that time and energy are only worthwhile when put into figuring out the transaction consolidation network, because increasing the block size is a tactic that is about as close to useless as can be imagined—*and* it will cause a hard fork!

There is no such thing as stimulating growth.
There is merely capital allocation; all of the things that central banks do simply move capital from one sector of the economy to another; indeed, people often don't even realize that "their" capital (i.e., purchasing power) is being reallocated without their consent.
This would work if central banks were really good at choosing how capital should be allocated, but we've seen time and again that they're not really that expert—and because they are moving such vast amounts of capital around, they really do a lot of damage when they make a bad bet.
That's the whole point of capitalism: You get the most consistently good results when you allow people to make decisions of capital allocation with regard to only their own capital; central banks break this principle on a terrifying scale.

* Why must I keep stating the following? If you want to place your transactions directly into Bitcoin, there's nobody stopping you from doing so.
    However, I doubt you'll find it best to stuff your personal morning coffee purchase into the settlement layer with an explicit Bitcoin transaction—most such transactions can and should be consolidated.
    [According to this article from 2012]( this one data center for processing Visa transactions can handle at least 2500 transactions per second.
    At an average of 600 bytes per transaction, that would require a 900&amp;nbsp;MB Bitcoin block.
* You have no proof that 1&amp;nbsp;MB is arbitrarily small. In fact, pool operators like think that's too high.
* Even if you do, a hard ~~limit~~ fork is bad policy; as a precedent, it means you can never be certain of the rules of a given system, and must therefore keep tabs on the latest political discussions, because some hysterical and probably wrongheaded majority might try to force everyone to follow its plans.
    If you want people to use your altcoin, then set up a 2-way peg, and have them transfer their assets to your new system voluntarily, if only so that your new system can actually be tested before trying to takeover with a violent hard fork.

My employer? I'm not associated with Blockstream in any way, if that's what you mean.
Ironically, *you* are failing to address the very real concerns associated with using a hard&amp;nbsp;fork to increase the blocksize limit. Nobody is arguing for keeping 1&amp;nbsp;MB forever, just that there may be more sophisticated ways to handle the situation than what has so far been proposed.
It might be interesting to let the 1&amp;nbsp;MB limit be reached and surpassed. Maybe we'll find out that the vast majority of transactions are utter rubbish, and would do well to be rendered unafforable in the meantime.

Yes. Fortunately, the world is a place that is a lot more trustworthy than the world for which Bitcoin was designed, and that inherent trustworthiness of the *actual* world can be exploited to the benefit of everyone—which, after&amp;nbsp;all, is why off-chain services even exist.
So, in principle, all of the of transactions of the world can be carved up according to appropriate trust requirements, time requirements, usage, etc., and funneled automatically (or organically) through networks tailored to them, ultimately ending up at&amp;nbsp;some&amp;nbsp;point ***back*** on the coldest, most unforgivingly trustless network: Bitcoin.
* What's nice about the Lightening Network is that it isn't that far removed from Bitcoin proper; it's just a way to deal with related economic activity more intelligently.
* What's nice about 2-way&amp;nbsp;pegs is that they provide a way for BTC to interact more directly with entirely novel altcoin systems, not only to provide native features that Bitcoin doesn't, but maybe also to allow for a successor to Bitcoin to be grown from a small, hand-crafted, trusted experiment into a completely self-sustaining, independent behemoth that nobody can shut down, all without a fork of any kind (or at least without a fork that promises much disruption or the forced adoption of an untested system).
    Check out Blockstream's [Alpha sidechain]( which is a kind of re-imagining of Bitcoin, tempered by much more advanced cryptography and years of insight into Bitcoin's bugs and missing features (for instance, you mentioned the privacy concerns of a public ledger; well, Alpha offers confidential transactions and n-of-n signatures that are indistinguishable from 1-of-1 signatures).
    As an aside, note that a 2-way&amp;nbsp;peg can already be implemented with a semi-trusted federation of servers, can be implemented in a more decentralized way with a soft-fork change to Bitcoin, and can be implemented without permission if Bitcoin ever reintroduces full support for completely generic smart contracts.

For those curious, see Gavin Adresen's post on Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLTs):
* [O(1) Block Propagation](
Perhaps these comments spot the problem:
* [Peter Todd](
    &gt;&gt; The problem is not propagating new blocks faster, it's making scalability assumptions based on that speed when largish miners have economic incentives to sabotage it. Remember that if your goal is to find more blocks than other miners, you have no incentive to propagate your blocks to more than 30% of the hashing power.(1)
* [john-connor]( spots the problem:
    &gt;&gt; This proposal is nice for academics but it's not enforceable on the network since it isn't part of the Proof-of-Work. I say this because you are assuming some sort of consensus in your proposal and assuming that miners actually want their block to propagate fast. If a broadcasted block reaches less than 1/3 of the network then you've mined it, it's in the main chain, why not let the other miners find out sometime later while you are working on the next block in the meantime?
    &gt;&gt; The larger scalability problem is the bitcoin network code in it's current state will not scale to 1000's of transactions per second given how poorly it is written. The bitcoin wiki details only several of the problems.

    How do you communicate to everybody what that minimum hashrate is? How do you get people to pay enough to keep that minimum hashrate? For example, after the next halving, etc., will the hashrate still be above that minimum?

That's *precisely* the point.

    The Bitcoin XT approach is thrilling, but myopic.
* The Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core mentality, on the other hand, is that we need to come up with more general solutions to the problem of Bitcoin improvement itself, so that even "contentious" ideas have a way to be tried without destroying what is already *known* to work.
    The Bitcoin Core approach is boring, but perceptive.
Why should one group's opinion be forced upon the other?
Perhaps it would be valuable to *everyone* to have a kind of hierarchy of opt-in blockchain systems that provide varying degrees of security and usability, thereby allowing the market to find the optimal usage of each; eople should be able to start all manner of competing systems, directly interlinked by BTC, thereby **allowing the market to figure out the best parameters** for various usages.
As the article points out, consider something like [extension blocks]( which is an idea related to sidechains; they would allow for small-blockers and big-blockers to exist in parallel, each system feeding off the virtues of the other.
That is, **the whole issue should just be avoided** by keeping discordant consensus systems (ones that together would initiate a fork) *explicitly* separate, at most linked only *explicitly* through something like a 2-way peg, or maybe extension blocks, or possibly [subchains]( etc.
There's *much* more creative discussion to be had.
Why should there ever be fear of a fork? Why should anyone ever be forced onto a system that has yet to prove itself? The hard fork way of handling problems in Bitcoin, a supposedly decentralized system, is naive and unsophisticated, and it's certainly not applicable to the *general* problem of improving Bitcoin safely.

Consider: "[Our analysis]( indicates that for compensation per block to remain constant after the next halving event, fees would have to increase to ~$4.6 per transaction (from 4 cents today) if transaction volumes and \[BTC\] price remain unchanged."
Of course, such fees will never happen. Instead, the BTC price will rise, and the mining industry will probably shrink; as time goes by, the price will rise less and less, and the mining industry will shrink more and more.
Hopefully, transaction *volume* can increase to spread the costs across more people.
It should be noted that according to [the same analysis of real-world data]( "the average bitcoin transaction data size has grown to roughly 600 bytes".
Thus, in a *completely&amp;nbsp;full* **100&amp;nbsp;MB block**, you could get 166666 transactions of an average nature; that's 277.8 transactions per second. In contrast, [Visa handles]( an average of 2000 transactions per second, and a peak capacity of 56&amp;nbsp;000 transactions per second!
What's worse is that even a 100&amp;nbsp;MB block is completely out of the question, unless you don't mind the possibility of extreme centralization, especially given that [the mining industry is already being paid the equivalent of a completely full 80&amp;nbsp;MB block]( (with an average transaction fee of 4&amp;nbsp;U.S.&amp;nbsp;cents) and yet whine about an increase in the block size from 1&amp;nbsp;MB, *and* are about to see a significant loss in their income due to the halving of the block reward.
Lifting the block-size limit is a hard fork; it is the equivalent of telling everybody to switch to an unproven, conflicting altcoin, and even if that switch is successful, there are not enough users to make completely full 80 MB blocks anyway, and if there were enough users, the burden of such large blocks might well have a deleterious effect on the topology of the network.
Transactions must be consolidated by a standardized overlay network, and placed into Bitcoin as a settlement transaction; the occasional power user may, of&amp;nbsp;course, place a transaction directly into Bitcoin's blockchain if desired—after all, it's far more important to secure a collection of 100 thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee.

For Bitcoin to be sufficiently decentralized, Bitcoin must be managed by enough people such that they are too disorganized to effect much change. Otherwise, what's the point of Bitcoin?
You cannot mandate that; people must have strong incentives. 
The premise of Bitcoin is merely that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or catastrophically incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though Bitcoin's design doesn't guarantee it.
That is, Bitcoin is designed on the assumption that the collection of miners is dominated by general interests (as opposed to a special interest), and that the hashrate is sufficiently high to prevent any special interest from gaining significant authority.
General interests, typically, aren't too sophisticated, and they become dumber as a mob mentality is fomented. If anything, Bitcoin is based on the assumption that the original ideas of Bitcoin are pretty darn smart and that a bunch of independent people are too disorganized to collude to change the rules easily.
* Losing miners possibly reduces the participants with general interests.
* Losing hashrate lowers the barrier to authority for special interests.
Even if there are *currently* general interests dominating, you cannot just mandate a hashrate; the incentives have to be there—*somebody* has to pay for it. What is the minimum hashrate required to keep it sufficiently decentralized? That is, what is the minimum hashrate required to keep any special interest from gaining significant authority? How do you communicate to everybody what that minimum hashrate is? How do you get people to pay enough to keep that minimum hashrate? For example, after the next halving, etc., will the hashrate still be above that minimum?
It's not wise to mess with the dynamics of the system; if you want to mess with them, then make sure you're only putting your own capital at risk.

Your numbers might not agree with reality. See [Part&amp;nbsp;2]( the linked analysis; while you assume 240 bytes per transaction, the real-world data apparently suggests that "the average bitcoin transaction data size has grown to roughly 600 bytes", etc.
Also, as already stated, it's not enough to *allow* bigger blocks or a faster block rate, because there just simply aren't enough transactions at 4&amp;nbsp;cents per transaction to compensate the mining industry as it currently exists; there aren't enough people using Bitcoin to take advantage of those changes.

What is that? 2^20 MB? 1048576&amp;nbsp;MB? 1.05&amp;nbsp;***T***iB every 10 minutes?
Well, let's suppose for a moment that even under such a heavy burden, Bitcoin remains sufficiently decentralized (as described above). With the 600&amp;nbsp;bytes per average transaction that we see today, that would allow about 2912711 transactions per second, which is only 52 times what Visa's network can handle today, despite a block size that is a million times the size it is today. Sounds... like the wrong way to think about how to scale...
Anyway, like most of the other proles, you are missing the fundamental point: Before scaling can really be considered, it's much more important to get right the infrastructure for evolving Bitcoin *in&amp;nbsp;any&amp;nbsp;direction*; as explained in the previous comments, your solution is an inadequate approach.
So, what I'm explaining to *you* is that your approach will make Bitcoin increasingly a matter of *majority* rule, whereas the goal of Bitcoin is—to a large number of people—instead to make it extremely difficult to attain a majority for any change whatsoever. That is the political divide between the 2 camps:

Ah. So you like the idea of a conservative, stable, reliable, infrequently altered core system that provides the foundation for BTC, the token with which a whole bunch of interesting and even proprietary systems can be run and interconnected. That is, you like sidechains or extension blocks, or the like, and something like the Lightning Network to handle currency usage, and so on.
That's the **Internet of Money**, folks.
In the future, how are you going to roll changes into Bitcoin proper when the whole consensus system is massively deployed in a decentralized fashion around the planet?
Consider that even with its ruthless iron fist wrought from hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of centralized and authoritarian monopoly, Microsoft has struggled to displace its own operating system, Windows&amp;nbsp;XP. Even on the advent of Windows&amp;nbsp;10, its ancient and decidedly inferior predecessor has [perhaps around 12% market&amp;nbsp;share](
Innovation is only workable at the edges of the core system, and the only reasonable path toward bringing that innovation directly into the core system will be to evolve and grow an edge experiment until it seamlessly becomes the de&amp;nbsp;facto core itself without breaking nearly anyone's expectations.
Therein lies the fundamental political divide:
* One party thinks majority dictation means consensus, while the other party thinks consensus means there is no such thing as dictation.
Is Bitcoin about majority rule, or is Bitcoin about the extreme decentralization of power?

We do *not* know that Bitcoin could handle bigger blocks—at&amp;nbsp;least not without significant centralization. More to the point, though, [even 100&amp;nbsp;MB blocks would be far from adequate]( and that is certainly fantastically too large at this point in time.
Off chain transactions are absolutely required—but only if there's a standardized off-chain network that provides relatively transparent Bitcoin usage for various levels of security. People cannot be bothered to make sure they are operating "in&amp;nbsp;network".
The market is the only way to find a workable solution, but that doesn't mean it can find it quickly.

They haven't provided an option for people; they've created the specter of an ultimatum to move to an untested system.
Moreover, scaling has been discussed for a long time, including how to integrate necessary changes into the whole ecosystem with as little breakage of expectations as possible—that's why there are such developments as the Lightning Network and sidechains (among many others).
* Bitcoin XT appears to have been anounced on [2014&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;28]( but had nothing to do with the blocksize debate. Indeed:
    &gt; A brief note about the goals of this project. The XT project is intended to provide a friendly environment where [SPV] app developers and merchants can experiment with new features and explore new directions for the protocol, if there is demand for that. Those upgrades could then be considered for inclusion into Core at a later date. I do not expect there to be thousands of XT users any time soon, but that's OK. Because the patch set contains features that don't require everyone to opt in (e.g. changes to the tx/block formats), even just a few nodes can be useful.
    Wow! It was so benign that nobody even responded.
* It was only on [2015 May 6]( that Mat Corallo brought the discussion of block sizes to the development mailing list from Gavin's blog:
    &gt; Recently there has been a flurry of posts by Gavin at
 which advocate strongly for increasing
the maximum block size. However, there hasnt been any discussion on this
mailing list in several years as far as I can tell.
    That seems to have begun the debate in earnest. Mike&amp;nbsp;Hearn entered the fray on [2015&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;7]( spouting many of the mantras espoused by the proponents of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT today, and taking everybody off guard by emphasizing the need for swift, dictatorial action.
* Very interesting discussion ensued, including new proposals, variations on proposals, criteria for a hard fork and for what values of block size would be obviously acceptable, etc. Adam Back proposed extension&amp;nbsp;blocks on [2015&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;30]( to allow for a possibly very robust, generalized upgrade system related to sidechains, and which only requires a soft fork.
* Then, on [2015 June 14]( Mike&amp;nbsp;Hearn made the first veiled threat of a hard&amp;nbsp;fork:
    &gt; As nothing that has been proposed so far (Lightning, merge mined chains, extension blocks etc) has much chance of actual deployment any time soon, that leaves raising the block size limit as the only possible path left. Which is why there will soon be a fork that does it.
    [which Adam Back caught](
    &gt;&gt; Which is why there will soon be a fork that does it.
    &gt; I understand why you would be keen to scale bitcoin, everyone here is.
    &gt; But as you seem to be saying that you will do a unilateral hard-fork, and fork the code-base simultaneously, probably a number of people have questions, so I'll start with some...
So, Bitcoin XT only *stifled* discussion, and instead turned it into one giant political debate where people chose teams and dug their heels in for bloody battle. What a massive waste of resources!

So, if there must be a hard fork at this point in the game, then Adam's suggestion is at least useful while still being conservative. Then, the question as to other values for the block size can be handled more robustly as just described.

Well, they are not separate in the sense that the mining industry has grown up around a certain compensation, and that compensation is increasingly the burden of transaction fees.
The more users of Bitcoin, the cheaper it is for any one individual to use Bitcoin.
Right now, for instance, with a block reward of 25&amp;nbsp;BTC, the system is operating as though there is no block reward and there are completely full 80&amp;nbsp;MB blocks where the average transaction fee is 4 cents. Clearly, though, that interpretation does not match reality, and so there are going to be some major changes in the entire system as the block reward diminishes.
@_date: 2015-08-12 15:06:53
Interestingly, a block reward is a major incentive; it's a major reason why Bitcoin currently works at all with any reasonable degree of security.
For Bitcoin to work, blocks *must* be produced at a regular rate. Why should a miner go to the trouble of producing a block? Because he gets paid fees to do so—a block must always contain at least one fee payment.
Now, you may have seen people complain about a miner producing a block without even one transaction in it; yet, this complaint is wrongheaded! The block *does* contain a transaction in it, one with a very large fee indeed: The block reward transaction.
    
Who is paying that very large fee? *Everybody who owns Bitcoin*; it's inflation, and that inflation is the incentive to produce blocks regularly.
The block reward is basically a transfer of purchasing power to the miners from everyone who holds BTC; it is a way for *everyone* who has any kind of relation with Bitcoin to pay for the maintenance of Bitcoin; if there is a block reward, then even "hodlers" are paying the network to safeguard their loot.
Of course, inflation is a blunt instrument; why should a transaction buried safely under very many blocks continue to pay as much for protection as a freshly buried transaction? This and many other qualms make such an inflationary mechanism unpalatable to many people, but its one saving grace is that it's an *easy* way of accounting; everybody is forced to pay a simple tithe. It is computationally trivial, and that is why it could win—there are no sacred cows when it comes to making something work.
Also, while constant inflation might obscure the actual necessary costs of mining, won't the mining industry naturally grow until the costs match the inflation *exactly*? In other words, no matter how you set a subsidy, the miners will grow or shrink to fit it. After all, consider the massive computation that has been thrown behind Bitcoin due to the system essentially overpaying miners; that is, setting an inflation rate might in some way be the same thing as setting the desired *minimum* hashrate.
The economic majority might find that a low-level of endless inflation is the only way to fund Bitcoin with a certain minimum of security; on top of that, the proles will forever be clamoring for the hodlers to be paying "their fair share" to maintain the system.

Your point is that the block size needs to increase to avoid people jumping ship to some altcoin; well, that altcoin would, at&amp;nbsp;worst, have to copy Bitcoin's blockchain to have any chance. That is, at&amp;nbsp;wost, people would start jumping over to a hard&amp;nbsp;fork.
So, you're saying we've got to hard&amp;nbsp;fork now, before people are forced to hard&amp;nbsp;fork later. It doesn't make any sense; I'd rather take my chances on the existing, working system, and only be forced to the new system by the actual market forces, rather than ideology.

Well, indeed. However, the calculations show that time and energy are only worthwhile when put into figuring out the transaction consolidation network, because increasing the block size is a tactic that is about as close to useless as can be imagined—*and* it will cause a hard fork!

[You are making the same mistake.](
Bitcoin is designed on the premise that the collection of miners is dominated by general interests (as opposed to a special interest), and that the hashrate is sufficiently high to prevent any special interest from gaining significant authority.
* Losing miners possibly reduces the participants with general interests.
* Losing hashrate lowers the barrier to authority.
These issues are of interest to the discussion of the Bitcoin network as a third party.
As an aside, an interesting question is how high must a hashrate be in order to be sufficient, and how is that information communicated (whether directly or indirectly) between participants?
@_date: 2015-08-12 21:11:15
* &gt; A normal transaction is 250 bytes
    [An analysis of the real-world data]( shows that the *average* transaction size is about 600 bytes.
* &gt; this begs the question \[about how high a transaction fee the market can bear\]
    Come on, Rusty; it *raises* the question.
    Anyway, there is a more interesting question. Bitcoin is designed on the premise that the collection of miners is dominated by general interests (as opposed to a special interest), and that the hashrate is sufficiently high to prevent any special interest from gaining significant authority.
    * Losing miners possibly reduces the participants with general interests.
    * Losing hashrate lowers the barrier to authority.
    We can already kind of measure the distribution of mining. But, how high must a hashrate be in order to be sufficient, and how is that information communicated (whether directly or indirectly) between participants?
* &gt; don’t count on future bitcoin fees being insignificant, nor promise others that bitcoin has “free transactions”.
    At the other end of [this link]( it is pointed out that as the block reward decreases, the mining industry as it currently exists can only be sustained if at least one of the following statements is true:
    * 1. The price of BTC increases significantly.
    * 2. The average transaction fee increases significantly.
    * 3. The number of transactions of an average nature increases significantly.
    * 4. The block reward is not decreased so much, or never goes away; that is, the 21&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;BTC cap is broken.
    It is observed that `2.` (increased fees) is out of the question, leaving `1.` (increased price), `3.` (increased transaction count), and `4.` (increased BTC supply). However, for `1.` to be useful in the long-term, it requires `4.`, and nobody likes `4.`, so that means they are both out of the question^\*, leaving only `3.` (increased transaction count).
    Unfortunately, increasing the block size does not scale transaction count adequately. Hence, the need for an overlay that consolidates very many cheap transactions into expensive settlement transactions.
    &amp;nbsp;  
    &amp;nbsp;  
    &amp;nbsp;  
    &amp;nbsp;  
    ------------
    \* Strangely, *nobody* seems to understand this point, at least the first time around.
    As the value of BTC increases, people will lower their transaction fees, so if transaction volume is held constant, the amount of income a miner receives from transaction fees does not increase much if at all. However, the block reward is *fixed*, regardless of the value of BTC; thus, as the value of BTC increases, the only way a miner can benefit in terms of compensation per block is through the block reward.
    Yet, the block reward is diminishing geometrically; therefore, a rising value for BTC has a geometrically decreasing benefit to miners, and is therefore not a long-term solution as an incentive to make blocks.
    Put another way, to depend on a rising value for BTC as a means of compensating miners is to depend on a block reward; hence, one way to make sure miners are suitably compensated is always to have a block reward, thereby breaking the 21&amp;nbsp;million BTC cap.

Both supply (mining) and demand (using) must be profitable endeavors in order for Bitcoin as a whole to be worthwhile. What you call "overhead", the miners might deem "essential", and what miners call "a small fee", you might deem "outlandish!" It's this tug of war that allows a system to evolve into something that's workable.
There is no solution that can be deduced for all time; the system must constantly iterate towards a workable solution, and a solution that is workable at one time may not be workable at another.

Maybe Satoshi did intend for it—before Bitcoin was a multi-billion dollar system, and before more sophisticated approaches like sidechains were even conceived!

**This is a major failure of Bitcoin**; a soft fork should at worst endanger the income of a very small minority of miners, but this debacle has endangered the economic activity of users who shouldn't care anything about soft forks—it would seem, now, that a user will never know whether he should wait 6 confirmations or *36* confirmations, unless he keeps tabs on the advice of various centralized "authorities"!
Ironically—against the very insight that underpins Bitcoin—the powers-that-be scheduled the system to run according to the *promises* of various third parties, miners simply *saying* that they'll do some verification; the system was set in motion along a path determined by *faith* and *trust* in the rightful behavior of essentially unknown entities. Behold the outcome of lacking ***sufficient*** Proof of Work!

Yes, I agree it was a soft fork.
However, [as I explain here]( soft forks are still problematic, though less so than a hard fork.
A narrowing of the rules is still an alteration of consensus, because it means that what was once permissible is no longer permissible; a miner running the original Bitcoin code might happily produce a 32&amp;nbsp;MB block (because those were the rules of the game), only to find that a lot of the other players changed the rules while the game was being played.
Such a disruption of the rules can be catastrophic, as we witnessed during the BIP66 debacle.

* That still leaves open the option of a hard fork *when the time comes*. That time is not now.
* One man's spam is another man's use. You know how you differentiate between spam and use? You rank by fee.
    ***By&amp;nbsp;definition***, a transaction that gets into a block is not spam.
    Other problems with what *you* call spam can be handled without a hard fork, by changing relay parameters and the like.
@_date: 2015-08-06 15:53:45
Sure. However, it must be recognized that Bitcoin *will* be a settlement system; only after accepting that fact can you start designing a system that works.
That being said, the problem with increasing the block size is 2 fold:
* **Centralization**
    The premise of Bitoin is that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though it doesn't guarantee it.
    Increasing the block size damages that design for decentralization; of course, *some* centralization might be a good tradeoff if it yields a much more usable system, but it's clear that growing the block size is a pretty damn limited solution in that regard.
* **Hard&amp;nbsp;Forking**
    Unfortunately, to update the allowable block size, a new altcoin must be created based on a copy of Bitcoin's blockchain, and then everybody must switch to that altcoin.
    The common sense is that the block size limit needs to be increased to avoid people jumping ship to some better altcoin; well, that altcoin would, at&amp;nbsp;worst, have to copy Bitcoin's blockchain to have any chance. That is, at wost, people would start jumping over to a hard&amp;nbsp;fork, the most popular of such altcoins being "Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT".
    So, you're saying we've got to hard&amp;nbsp;fork now, before people are forced to hard&amp;nbsp;fork later; it doesn't make any sense. I'd rather take my chances on the existing, working system, and only be forced to the new system by the actual market forces, rather than ideology.

According to [this analysis of real-world data]( "the average bitcoin transaction data size has grown to roughly 600 bytes".
In a completely full 16&amp;nbsp;MB block, you could get 26666 transactions of an average nature; that's 44.443 transactions per second.
Similarly, in a completely full 100&amp;nbsp;MB block, you could get 166666 transactions of an average nature; that's 277.8 transactions per second. *Bwahahahahaaaaaaaa!!!!1111* [Visa handles]( an average of 2000 transactions per second, and a peak capacity of 56&amp;nbsp;000 transactions per second!
What's worse is that even a 100&amp;nbsp;MB block is *completely* out of the question, unless you don't mind the possibility of extreme centralization—especially because [currently, the mining industry is getting paid as though it's creating completely full 80 MB blocks]( and they are going to lose that incentive in short order.
Transactions must be consolidated by a standardized overlay network, and placed into Bitcoin as a settlement transaction; the occasional power user may, of&amp;nbsp;course, place a transaction directly into Bitcoin's blockchain if desired; after all, it's far more important to secure a collection of 100 thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee.

* Under a soft fork, the new rules are acceptable to the old miners, but the old rules are not acceptable to the new miners; the 2 camps stabilize around one history, and the minority miners are signaled of their situation by the orphaning. The problem here is that a higher probability of reorganization diminishes security (a confirmation isn't as strong as it used to be—recall the BIP66 fiasco, when there was a centralized sticky post on warning people to wait *30* confirmations *more than usual*), and wallets that are supposedly fully verifying become SPV clients with respect to the new feature.
* Under a hard fork, there are simply 2 different camps, and each eventually rejects the history of the other... *forever*. The only signal the minority camp receives is that it's taking a lot longer for confirmations to arrive, but that changes as the difficulty adjusts amogst the old miners; otherwise, they are still making block rewards, and fees; they are essentially oblivious.
    **But, that's not even the problem.**
    Because there are 2 histories, people could and probably will become very confused. SPV clients might be switched to the new blockchain, but merchants (who are more likely to use verifying nodes) might be on the old blockchain. Payments won't be received, because according to one history, they are invalid, or double spends might be made, because there are 2 histories at play.
    *Fine*. Fine. People eventually figure out what's going on and "upgrade" their software to avoid *further* difficulties in interacting with the economic majority. Yet, at what loss? How much economic activity must be forgotten and written off in throwing out the old blockchain in favor of the new?
Bitcoin will never be on a firm foundation as long as there is the possibility of a hard fork (and a soft fork is not much better); the only right thing to do is to let each system stand on its own (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, etc.), but create explicit paths between them with what's called a 2-way peg, so that users can transfer their coins from one system to the other.
There's also a related idea called an "extension block", but I don't know too much about them yet.

The assumption of Bitcoin is merely that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or catastrophically incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though it doesn't guarantee it.
That is, Bitcoin is designed on the assumption that the collection of miners is dominated by general interests (as opposed to a special interest), and that the hashrate is sufficiently high to prevent any special interest from gaining significant authority. **General interests, typically, aren't too sophisticated, and they become dumber as a mob mentality is fomented.**
If anything, Bitcoin is based on the assumption that the original ideas of Bitcoin are pretty darn smart and that a bunch of independent people are too disorganized to collude to change the rules easily.
So, for Bitcoin to be sufficiently decentralized, Bitcoin must be managed by enough people such that they are too disorganized to effect much change.

For now, you just have to play the part of a central banker, holding everyone's hand through a tumultuous time, and just wincing when people don't hear your edicts.
Obviously, future forks should be handled with a combination of:
* Decentralized heuristics that *any* wallet can run on its own.
* Centralized, trusted authorities to which wallet software can subscribe for extra information, such as how many confirmations are required to achieve a certain level of safety.
Hopefully, better protocols for rolling out changes to the consensus algorithm will be developed; we've learned this time around that you need sufficient Proof of *Work*; the miners are not proving that they're going to do the work that they say they'll do—we've just been trusting unknown organizations will do the right thing, which is about as anti-Bitcoin as you can get.

People thought there was consensus around BIP66; perhaps there was amongst humans. However, the system is run by computers, and it turns out that they didn't really give a damn.
"Consensus" is what "consensus" does; that's why the only valid solution is one that has been tested with real-world value at risk, and thus a sidechain is clearly the best approach.

How am I in any way forcing sombody to do or not to do something? Your thinking is completely warped.
On the other hand, miners who adopt a hard fork are explicitly trying to force other people to a new (and completely untested) system, which is a pretty nasty precedent for something like Bitcoin.


As an aside, you should note that the assumption of Bitcoin is merely that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or catastrophically incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though it doesn't guarantee it.
That is, Bitcoin is designed on the assumption that the collection of miners is dominated by general interests (as opposed to a special interest), and that the hashrate is sufficiently high to prevent any special interest from gaining significant authority.
**General interests, typically, aren't too sophisticated, and they become dumber as a mob mentality is fomented.** If anything, Bitcoin is based on the assumption that the original ideas of Bitcoin are pretty darn smart and that a bunch of independent people are too disorganized to collude to change the rules easily.
So, for Bitcoin to be sufficiently decentralized, Bitcoin must be managed by enough people such that they are too disorganized to effect much change.

Fortunately, we have an impartial, neutral, objective 3rd party: Reality.
Bitcoin must be scaled in order to be self-sustaining; the volume of transactions must grow tremendously in order for Bitcoin usage to be **both cheap and secure**.
However, one data center for processing Visa transactions was handling at&amp;nbsp;least [2500&amp;nbsp;transactions per second]( in the year *2012*.
At an average of [600&amp;nbsp;bytes per transaction]( that would require a **900&amp;nbsp;MB&amp;nbsp;block** in Bitcoin.
[According to Visa]( VisaNet can handle 56&amp;nbsp;000 transactions per second, which would require a 20.160&amp;nbsp;***G***B block, yet you want Bitcoin to be bigger and more pervasive than Visa, amirite?

Why should there ever be fear of a fork? Why should anyone ever be forced onto a system that has yet to prove itself?

* With regard to a sidechain, presumably the consensus authorities (miners or otherwise) would receive compensation as fees in terms of the sidechain's token, which would be—in the normal case—pegged to BTC and therefore transferable back to the "mainchain" for use there in that system.
    Of course, if mining the sidechain becomes such a better opportunity that miners stop mining Bitcoin, then the economic majority will have chosen a successor system in the same way that an economic majority might choose "Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT" as the successor system.

**The main thrust of Bitcoin was written in 8 pages of easy reading**, which indicates that there was already plenty of structure on which to build Bitcoin.
Satoshi's understanding of cryptography and use thereof was minimal and sometimes decidedly naive. The main components had been lying around for years: Hashcash(!), Merkle trees (a lot like git works), p2p networks (bittorrent, etc.), widespread internet, a burgeoning mobile computing industry, the rise of libertarian economics and politics, and a global financial crisis, etc.
If it hadn't been Satoshi, it would have been someone someone else. Just like with regard to calculus: If it hadn't been Newton, it would have been Leibniz, or one of the many other people working on similar thinking. If it hadn't been Charles Darwin, it would have been Alfred Russel Wallace, whose own work forced Darwin to publish his book so as not to lose the credit, etc.

Besides the fact that good programming is difficult, and that it takes a lot of resources and commitment to come to a correct understanding of any sufficiently complex project, it is of course incredibly dangerous to use alternatives to Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core, because there could be subtle differences that lead to unforeseen hard&amp;nbsp;forks and the like.
It turns out that in Bitcoin, an existing bug is almost always by definition a feature; small changes can have huge consequences, because consensus must be exact and precise, and the underlying technologies on which Bitcoin is built are neither exact nor precise by default.
This is why 2-way-pegs to sidechains are so valuable: they will allow for experimentation of alternative blockchain systems (like Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT) without jeopardizing the "main" blockchain system (Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core).

    &gt; Three months ago I discovered a miner with ~1% of the hashrate that was processing transactions with no signature validation at all. If I had sent that miner a transaction where I spent a million of other people's bitcoins they would have mined it and the half of the non-verifying miners would likely have given it 6+ confirms for any SPV client; and thats the more fundamental issue here which no amount of version checking would help with.

Transactions will always be "instant", in the sense that they shoot across the network to recipient at the speed of the Internet.
Transactions will *never* be "instant", in the sense that it takes time to receive a confirmation.
Bitcoin will *never* be on a firm foundation as long as there is the threat of a hard fork; each system (Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;1.0, Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0, etc.) needs to be left to stand on its own, with 2-way pegs to provide paths between them.

How is that you cannot see the irrelevance of your point?
Who is hungriest? Who is on the verge of starvation or is about to die of thirst? Who is fat, relaxed, and doesn't mind waiting at the bar for a table? That is:
* **How should resources be allocated most efficiently?**
*Nobody knows, because nobody has complete knowledge!*
In the absence of information, the best *guess* is that everyone is equal—hence, first-come-first-served; timing is the information used to differentiate. Next, you give everyone a representation of work that society owes them: Money. The more money someone has, the more work society owes that person (yes, you can inherit what someone else is owed!); the more money someone offers, the more work society should do for that person; in your scenario, doing "more work" means "waiting longer for a table in order to let that someone ahead in the queue".
In this way, the money offered acts as a transmission of information about how much someone values a service, and thus provides more information about how resources should be allocated according to needs and wants.
Indeed, through this mechanism, other patrons learn about how much the service is valued, and how much they need to do for society in order to be owed that service in return, etc. This feedback loop esablishes what services are possible, what services are need or wanted, etc.

* One data center for processing **Visa** transactions was handling at&amp;nbsp;least [2500&amp;nbsp;transactions per second]( in the year *2012*.
    At an average of [600&amp;nbsp;bytes per transaction]( that would require a **900&amp;nbsp;MB&amp;nbsp;block** in Bitcoin.
    That being said, the problem with increasing the block size is 2 fold:
    * **Centralization**
        The premise of Bitoin is that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though it doesn't guarantee it.
        Increasing the block size damages that design for decentralization; of course, *some* centralization might be a good tradeoff if it yields a much more usable system, but it's clear that growing the block size is a pretty damn limited solution in that regard.
        Further exacerbating the issue is the fact that the mining industry is going to be rapidly losing its income over the next several years. Right now, some miners are complaining that even 1&amp;nbsp;MB blocks are too large, even while [the whole mining industry is currently getting paid the equivalent of *completely&amp;nbsp;full* 80&amp;nbsp;MB blocks at 4&amp;nbsp;U.S.&amp;nbsp;cents per transaction](
    * **Hard&amp;nbsp;Forking**
        Unfortunately, to update the allowable block size, a new altcoin must be created based on a copy of Bitcoin's blockchain, and then everybody must switch to that altcoin.
        The common sense is that the block size limit needs to be increased to avoid people jumping ship to some better altcoin; well, that altcoin would, at&amp;nbsp;worst, have to copy Bitcoin's blockchain to have any chance. That is, at wost, people would start jumping over to a hard&amp;nbsp;fork, the most popular of such altcoins being "Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT".
        So, you're saying we've got to hard&amp;nbsp;fork now, before people are forced to hard&amp;nbsp;fork later; it doesn't make any sense. I'd rather take my chances on the existing, working system, and only be forced to the new system by the actual market forces, rather than ideology.
* So, at some point, there needs to be a **transaction-consolidation network** sitting atop Bitcoin, using Bitcoin as a highly secure settlement system; it must be recognized that Bitcoin *will* be a settlement system, and only after accepting that fact can you start designing a system that works.
    After all, it's more important to secure 100&amp;nbsp;thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any one particular purchase of coffee.
    Go ahead; stick your coffee purchase in the settlement layer directly if you want, but you won't want to do so, because that's insane; there is no point in storing that one transaction for all time in a highly secure record.
    This development is virtually *proved* by the fact that there are *already* so many ad&amp;nbsp;hoc off-chain transaction consolidation networks (ChangeTip, Coinbase, Circle, exchanges, etc.).
    *Fortunately*, **such an overlay need not be centralized**; consider something like the [Lightning&amp;nbsp;Network](

Yeah, if you're glued to like nobody will be.


That's impossible. There's no resource in the world that can be dominant all the time, which is why you're clamoring for a hard fork now.
A hard fork is what necessitates "forcibly and quickly" migrating; there's no a reason a sidechain couldn't incorporate the Bitcoin blockchain to handle your **cold storage coins** in the event of a detachment from Bitcoin proper. Sure, this would require a hard fork probably, but then at least it'd be known exactly what the new system would be like, because it's actually been shown to work.

That is just not true. The government has squandered resources; the resources that people thought they had are not really there.

The shortness of Satoshi's whitepaper shows just how much structure already existed on which to build Bitcoin. All of the constituent parts were already lying around and well understood, including:
* Merkle trees (think of git).
* decentralized self-bootstrapping peer-to-peer networks (think of bittorrent).
* an anti-spam mechanism (hashcash, which was invented before and is a fundamental component of Bitcoin).
* well understood public key cryptography.
* decades of research into digital currencies.
* decades of research into stack-based scripting languages for efficient, constrained computing environments (think of forth).
* a widespread Internet and cheap computing.
* a growing mobile computing space.
* the rise of libertarian politics and economics amidst a burgeoning global financial crisis.
Bitcoin's whitepaper was short, because Bitcoin was imminent; it didn't take much new insight to throw it together.

As for Democracy, it is an utter farce:

* Democracy can only work if it's base on capitalism, and capitalism doesn't require democracy, so why bother? More to the point, capitalism constrains democracy by not allowing violent imposition, and without violent imposition, democracy is useless.

* A hard fork is not an upgrade; it's war—may the losing side go fuck itself, quite possibly through the loss of significant economic activity, as well as damage to the image of Bitcoin as a stable system bound by rules to which people agree up&amp;nbsp;front.
* 2-way pegs are well understood; the best way to run a sidechain is not yet well understood. However, the "main" chain is protected from any fuck&amp;nbsp;up in running the sidechain; the same cannot be said when the alternate chain is a hard&amp;nbsp;fork.
    How can you not see the difference?

What's interesting is that a nascent sidechain could start off with a Fed-Peg (centralized by still distributed), and then transition to only merge-mining given a sufficient hashrate, and then transition back to a Fed-Peg if the hashrate fell too much, etc., making it possible to construct an experimental system until it's self sufficient.
However, I doubt financial institutions are interested in the mining of their sidechains; some consortium would keep control of consensus, though probably allow auditors or even the general public to view the blockchain.
At least you could use their sidechain and then escape to Bitcoin if things looked unsuitable to you.
As an aside, note that a 2-way peg can already be implemented with a semi-trusted federation of servers, and that it could be implemented in a more decentralized way with a soft-fork change to Bitcoin; alternatively, if Bitcoin ever reintroduces the more sophisticated script operations that Satoshi removed for fear of being too powerul, then a 2-way peg could be implemented as a smart contract without any special treatment.

**TL;DR:** A hard fork to increase the block-size limit is the same as creating a new altcoin (bootstrapped on Bitcoin's blockchain), and then just telling everybody to switch to it; that's an idiot's approach to a decentralized system.
* You want new characteristics for Bitcoin (e.g., a bigger **block&amp;nbsp;size**). This requires making a new system called *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* that copies over and begins to extend the same blockchain used by *Bitcoin*; this is the same as making a new **altcoin** (boostrapped on Bitcoin's blockchain) and then just telling everyone to move over to it.
    In technical terms, doing this is called a **hard&amp;nbsp;fork**, and it's disastrous because it can split the network, and thereby destroy fungibility—people will disagree on what a bitcoin is (that is, their software will disagree); hard forks as a policy for upgrading mean that the characteristics of Bitcoin are always at risk—the contract to which people thought they had agreed can just vanish! Furthermore:
    \* User support for *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* is not well known.
    \* Mining support for *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* is not well known.
    \* Whether *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* functions as intended is also not well known.
* A **sidechain** *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* is basically a hard&amp;nbsp;fork *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* as described above, except you do *not* copy the old blockchain over to the new system; instead, you connect a *new* blockchain to the old blockchain by means of a **2-way&amp;nbsp;peg**, and then *disable* the creation of new coins, deferring solely to the old system to continue that minting process.
    To use the new *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* system, any user can simply *choose* at his leisure to transfer control of his assets from the old *Bitcoin* system to the new *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* system; if he wants to return to the old system, he can do that, too!
    This transfer of control back and forth can either be explicit or implicit:
    * The explicit approach requires no counterparty; it uses the transaction mechanisms of the 2 systems. However, it is a slow process, because security requires, essentially, many confirmations in order to synchronize the 2 systems.
    * The implicit approach requires a counterparty; it involves exchanging the assets of one system for assets of the other system—but possibly with the security of atomic swaps, because both systems are digital and cryptographic; this could be very fast and cheap, and would facilitate an influx of new users who want to *try* out the new system.
    In the beginning, people will move their coins to the new system to get access to its new features, and then move back to the old system for the sake of security; as time goes on, people will just use the new system almost all the time; eventually, they'll use the new system *all* the time.
    Thereby, the new characteristics (e.g., larger blocks, etc.) can be *tested*, and the *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* system can therefore be built *slowly* until it *proves&amp;nbsp;itself*; hopefully, eventually, lots of people and miners will transfer to the *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* system as it becomes apparent that it's a good system.
    If *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* is successful, the decision can be made to **hard&amp;nbsp;fork** *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* to copy over the rest of the original *Bitcoin* blockchain and continue the minting process; this makes it an altcoin to which virtually everyone has *already* moved! Yet, isn't that hard&amp;nbsp;fork what everyone was trying to avoid in the first place? Well, at that point, the hard&amp;nbsp;fork is much more trivial, because:
    \* It is known how well the economy supports the new system.
    \* It is known how well the mining industry supports the new system.
    \* It is known whether *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* actually functions as intended.

Note, though, that this doesn't preclude evolution of the system. Indeed, that's the whole point of sidechains, the ultimate vision of which is that there is a hardened Bitcoin core that changes pretty much never, while innovation occurs on the edges through opt-in systems with which people can interact, thereby opening up to the free market the problem of finding the best solutions without endangering core principles.
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:56:20
You are not wrong. However, what you describe is the most primitive solution; it involves unnecessary suffering: Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT is just an altcoin that copies over Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain in the hope that everyone will switch to it. The results could be a loss of economic activity for the losing side, and therefore the loss of any sense of stability for Bitcoin as a system... that's an *idiot's* approach to upgrading a decentralized system (at least now that something more sophisticated, like 2-way pegs, is understood).
It seems to me that the whole issue should just be avoided by keeping discordant consensus systems (ones that together would initiate a hard fork) *explicitly* separate, at most linked only *explicitly* through something like a 2-way peg.
Why should there ever be fear of a fork? Why should anyone ever be forced onto a system that has yet to prove itself?
The only missing piece is figuring out objective criteria and an explicit protocol for pinching off a sidechain to become the "main" chain with as little disruption as possible—but even a hard fork to do so will be much more trivial, because the sidechain's functionality and acceptance will have been tested in the wild.

You have to think in terms off the blockchain that each peer will see; because there are two blockchains, they can become out of sync, and the lack of synchronization can be used to make double spends and a great deal of confusion.
In essence, Bitcoin XT is an altcoin that is being bootstrapped on Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain; Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT is *copying* the state of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core users' holdings, and then just hoping people switch to using Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT instead.
That is, a hard fork is the same thing as creating an altcoin and then just telling everybody to switch to it.
Bitcoin will never be on a firm foundation as long as there is the possibility of a hard&amp;nbsp;fork; the only right thing to do is to let each system stand on its own (Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core, Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT, etc.), but create explicit paths between them with what's called a 2-way peg, so that users can transfer their coins from one system to the other.
This would be achieved by making Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT a sidechain of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core; in that case, Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT would *still* be an altcoin, but it would start with a brand new blockchain that is coupled to Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain, and only Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core would be allowed to create new coins.
As time goes by, if Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT becomes the de&amp;nbsp;facto "Bitcoin", it would be possible to pinch off Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT, copy over the rest of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain, and then have Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT continue the minting process; even if this requires a hard fork, it would be much more trivial.

That's not a statement you can make.
The security of the pegging mechanism can be made arbitrarily strong, and beyond the pegging mechanism, a sidechain is a completely independent system; there are a number of ways to align incentives with mining the sidechain in order to thwart problems with merge-mining—indeed, merge-mining is not a requirement.
Even with merge-mining, a sidechain can be as secure as the main chain, and beyond merge-mining, it is perfectly possible for a side chain to be more secure than a main chain, especially when giving up some decentralization or low-trust.
Security is not something you can easily pin down, and one of the reasons sidechains are valuable is that they can account for different use cases that require different levels of security.
Certainly, for getting an upgrade of Bitcoin up and running for testing purposes, there's no reason to require security or decentralization that is as great as Bitcoin proper.

Firstly, a federated peg is not as simple as one node getting to choose what happens; it requires more trust than Bitcoin requires, but far less than the traditional "off-chain" transaction.
Secondly, the risk of SPV proofs can be made arbitrarily small; beyond this pegging mechanism, the coupled sidechains are completely independent, and can be secured in any way the users deem good enough.
Thirdly, I have no idea what you mean by scale.
* SPV proof checking is efficient. Full validation, too, will make sense for a *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* system that is all but ordained.
* A hard fork is always disruptive, but that's not the reason people are against hard fork to increase the block-size limit; rather, people are against a hard fork because they don't trust that the new rules are even a good idea—there's no point in discussing scale if you cannot even agree on the correct way to begin scaling.
    That is to say, a sidechain will enable new consensus rules to be put into practice in the real world to a much greater degree, and thereby prove their merits.

Making a hard fork is creating a new system, and just telling *everyone* in the supposedly decentralized system to switch over to the new system; at the very least, verifying nodes must upgrade, and must therefore be subscribed to centralized choreography.
A 2-way peg allows people to switch at any time between 2 systems (i.e., between 2 hard forks). If you're going to have a hard fork, the right way is to do it with a 2-way peg, so that people can upgrade *or&amp;nbsp;downgrade* almost at leisure.

You are correct in that there is no way to predict the future perfectly. However, that's the not the source of the problem.
Rather, the problem is that—due to idiotic default rules for relaying and accepting transactions, which were imposed in an ill-conceived attempt to make zero-confirmation transactions more "secure"—there is currently no way to *fix* a stuck transaction by issuing a replacement transaction that has a higher fee.
Were double spending like that more practical—even if restricted in some way—it would allow for a wallet to monitor the *current* fees, and ask the user if he wants to *resubmit* a transaction with a better bid to get into the blockchain.

A soft fork to enable merge mining is not theoretical; the mechanisms are well understood, and have been implemented in various ways already.

You are absolutely correct that starving a government does the trick, but that is only to say that eventually the parasite will killl off its host and thus itself; the Soviet Union is a good example.
However, the point remains that allowing violent imposition as the corner stone of your organization opens the possibility of tearing away any "restriction". As you said, the framers instituted Gold and Silver as the sole means by which government economic activity could occur—it was so fundamental, that this requirement was placed in the deepest foundations of government—and yet, despite those very same restrictive words sitting there in the Constitution to this very day, government does not abide by them; government has used all manner of machinations to weasel its way out from underneath them, especially its supposed "mandate" for violent imposition, and "representative democracy".
You cannot rely on a violently imposed *monopoly* to restrain itself from violent imposition; it's a contradiction in fundament principles.

It's worthless at the moment. *Currently*, with pruning enabled, you cannot relay blocks, you cannot look up transactions, and you cannot use a wallet. 
[0.11.0 Release Notes](
**Block file pruning**
This release supports running a fully validating node without maintaining a copy of the raw block and undo data on disk. To recap, there are four types of data related to the blockchain in the bitcoin system: the raw blocks as received over the network (blk???.dat), the undo data (rev???.dat), the block index and the UTXO set (both LevelDB databases). The databases are built from the raw data.
Block pruning allows Bitcoin Core to delete the raw block and undo data once it’s been validated and used to build the databases. At that point, the raw data is used only to relay blocks to other nodes, to handle reorganizations, to look up old transactions (if -txindex is enabled or via the RPC/REST interfaces), or for rescanning the wallet. The block index continues to hold the metadata about all blocks in the blockchain.
The user specifies how much space to allot for block &amp; undo files. The minimum allowed is 550MB. Note that this is in addition to whatever is required for the block index and UTXO databases. The minimum was chosen so that Bitcoin Core will be able to maintain at least 288 blocks on disk (two days worth of blocks at 10 minutes per block). In rare instances it is possible that the amount of space used will exceed the pruning target in order to keep the required last 288 blocks on disk.
Block pruning works during initial sync in the same way as during steady state, by deleting block files “as you go” whenever disk space is allocated. Thus, if the user specifies 550MB, once that level is reached the program will begin deleting the oldest block and undo files, while continuing to download the blockchain.
**For now, block pruning disables block relay.** In the future, nodes with block pruning will at a minimum relay “new” blocks, meaning blocks that extend their active chain.
**Block pruning is currently incompatible with running a wallet** due to the fact that block data is used for rescanning the wallet and importing keys or addresses (which require a rescan.) However, running the wallet with block pruning will be supported in the near future, subject to those limitations.
**Block pruning is also incompatible with -txindex and will automatically disable it.**
**Once you have pruned blocks, going back to unpruned state requires re-downloading the entire blockchain.** To do this, re-start the node with -reindex. Note also that any problem that would cause a user to reindex (e.g., disk corruption) will cause a pruned node to redownload the entire blockchain. Finally, note that when a pruned node reindexes, it will delete any blk???.dat and rev???.dat files in the data directory prior to restarting the download.
To enable block pruning on the command line:
* `-prune=N`: where N is the number of MB to allot for raw block &amp; undo data.
Modified RPC calls:
* `getblockchaininfo` now includes whether we are in pruned mode or not.
* `getblock` will check if the block’s data has been pruned and if so, return an error.
* `getrawtransaction` will no longer be able to locate a transaction that has a UTXO but where its block file has been pruned.
Pruning is disabled by default.

Because you're an idiot and require hand-holding:
* The paragraph around line 269 of the [whitepaper](
    &gt; To use Bitcoin as the parent chain, an extension to script which can recognise and validate such SPV proofs would be required. At the very least, such proofs would need to be made compact enough to fit in a Bitcoin transaction. **However, this is just a soft-forking change, without effect on transactions which do not use the new features.**
* Paragraph around line 370:
    &gt; A two-way peg, implemented as described in this paper, has only SPV security and therefore has greater short-term dependence on miner honesty than Bitcoin does (see the attack described in Section 4.2). However, a two-way peg can be boosted to security absolutely equal to Bitcoin’s if all full nodes on both systems inspect each other’s chain and demand mutual validity as a **soft-fork**ing rule.
    That kind of boosting would be desirable for a Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0 sidechain.
* Beginning of *Appendix A*:
    &gt; One of the challenges in deploying pegged sidechains is that Bitcoin script is currently not expressive enough to encode the verification rules for an SPV proof. The required expressiveness could be added in a safe, compatible, and highly compartmentalised way (e.g., by converting a no-op instruction into an `OP_SIDECHAINPROOFVERIFY` in a **soft-fork**).

* &gt; The issue is can the data be changed, and in a centralized blockchain it can be, while in bitcoin's blockchain it cannot.
    Sorry, but Bitcoin doen't *fundamentally* change that issue; the assumption is that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though it doesn't guarantee it.

Famous last words by every moron in power.
* Under a soft fork, the new rules are acceptable to the old miners, but the old rules are not acceptable to the new miners; the 2 camps stabilize around one history, and the minority miners are signaled of their situation by the orphaning. The problem here is that a higher probability of reorganization diminishes security (a confirmation isn't as strong as it used to be—recall the BIP66 fiasco, when there was a centralized sticky post on warning people to wait *30*&amp;nbsp;extra confirmations than usual), and supposedly verifying nodes become SPV clients with respect to the new feature.
* Under a hard fork, there are simply 2 different camps, and each eventually rejects the history of the other... *forever*. The only signal the minority camp receives is that it's taking a lot longer for confirmations to arrive, but that changes as the difficulty adjusts amogst the old miners; otherwise, they are still making block rewards, and fees; they are essentially oblivious.
    **But, that's not even the problem.**
    Because there are 2 histories, people will become very confused. SPV clients might be switched to the new blockchain, but merchants (who are more likely to use verifying nodes) might be on the old blockchain. Payments won't be received, because according to one history, they are invalid, or double spends might be made, because there are 2 histories at play.
    *Fine*. Fine. People eventually figure out what's going on and "upgrade" their software to avoid *further* difficulties in interacting with the economic majority. Yet, at what loss? How much economic activity must be forgotten and written off in throwing out the old blockchain in favor of the new?
    Again: Bitcoin will never be on a firm foundation as long as there is the possibility of a hard fork (and a soft fork is not much better); the only right thing to do is to let each system stand on its own (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, etc.), but create explicit paths between them with what's called a 2-way peg, so that users can transfer their coins from one system to the other.

The term "hard&amp;nbsp;fork" is shorthand here for the whole point:
* You want new properties for Bitcoin, so that requires making a new system called Bitcoin2.0 that uses the same Bitcoin blockchain (with feature extensions, as necessary), and then getting everyone to upgrade their software accordingly. That's a **hard&amp;nbsp;fork**, and it's disastrous (at least from a policy point of view).
    This is making a new altcoin and then telling everyone to move over to it; your new altcoin is simply bootstrapped with an existing blockchain. Mining support is not well known, and whether the altcoin functions as intended is also unknown.
* A **sidechain** Bitcoin2.0 is basically a hard fork Bitcoin2.0 as described above, except you don't copy the old Blockchain over to the new system; instead, you couple a *new* blockchain to the old one by means of a 2-way peg, and then disable the creation of new coins, deferring solely to the old system to continue that task.
    Thereby, upgrading becomes an explicit act of the user, either by transferring control of his Bitcoin coins directly to the Bitcoin2.0 system, or by swapping Bitcoin coins for Bitcoin2.0 coins with someone coming the other direction.
    The new properties can be tested, and the Bitcoin2.0 system built slowly until it proves itself; hopefully, lots of people and miners will transfer to the Bitcoin2.0 system as it becomes apparent that it's a good system.
    Eventually, the decision can be made to **hard&amp;nbsp;fork** Bitcoin2.0 to copy over the rest of the original Bitcoin blockchain and continue the minting process (if any). At that point, the hard fork is much more trivial, because there is known mining support, and it is known whether Bitcoin2.0 functions as intended.
In short, create "hard forks" with your desired properties and then allow the market to *find* the correct solution from among them by means of 2-way pegs between them.
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:20:45


Maybe Satoshi did intend for another hard fork—before Bitcoin was managing billions of dollars of assets, and before anyone had even conceived of more sophisticated approaches like sidechains.
Adam Back, the man behind Bitcoin's fundamental building block (hashcash), came up with sidechains specifically as a way to upgrade the system smoothly.
There are minds as great as (if not greater than) Satoshi. Listen to them.

Cash. How does it work?
@_date: 2015-07-22 20:32:56
* Note that **full support for 2-way&amp;nbsp;pegs requires only a soft&amp;nbsp;fork**. Even without that soft&amp;nbsp;fork, federated servers can be used right now to run a sidechain, albeit with the requirement that the federated servers be a semi-trusted set of nodes.
    Interestingly, if Satoshi had not removed some of the expressive power of Bitcoin's programming language, then it would have been possible to implement sidechains without any sort of fork.
* One more soft fork for Bitcoin to enable sidechains, and then no more forks thereafter, other than than to pinch off a successful sidechain to be the new Bitcoin.

* There is no such thing as a "main" chain or "side" chain; there are just 2 systems coupled by a 2-way peg, so that a user may switch to or from any system nearly at will.
    Whichever system is the most popular is the "main" chain, by&amp;nbsp;definition.
* It's not at all clear what the "original&amp;nbsp;plan" for the 1&amp;nbsp;MB block limit was; nullc has pointed out that Satoshi knew well how to write time-limited features, and could have easily done so with the block-size limit, but did not.
    Running code is what matters, not some airy fairy "original plan"; the running code says there is a limit, ***which brings us to the final and most important point...***
* ... ***Nobody is saying the limit shouldn't be lifted!***
    The question is how best to make any such change if it is required. Why is Gavin's proposal a good idea? What if we find out that it's a bad idea? Are you going to propose yet *another* hard fork to correct it?
    Your solution is asinine. It's childish. A more deliberate, well considered approach is required, and that means opening up the decision to the free market, so that users can make their own informed choices by switching to and from this system and that system; from this activity will emerge the correct solution, and it will only require that people risk as much as they are willing to risk.

Well, it's not inefficient, because the players running this proprietary network don't necessarily trust each other; also, cleaning up after an attack would just be a matter of grabbing one of the many copies of the blockchain holding the state that existed before the attack, which is easily verifiable and would probably only constitute a small loss in record keeping (no filing cabinets of records to go through manually, no unreliable human minds to probe, etc.).

    &gt;&gt;&gt; There is no such thing as a "small-blockista"
    &gt;&gt; Sure there is. They're people who think that smaller blocks are better for bitcoin. has been making this case tirelessly since forever, and is of a similar persuasion.
    &gt; I don't think, and I don't think Petertodd thinks smaller blocks are in independent virtue without considering the size relative to demand/fees, computational resources, and bandwidth resources. E.g. if magically overnight CPUs everywhere because 10x faster, bandwidth became 10x faster, disks became 10x bigger, and demand at a given fee rate when up 10x... then larger blocks would be the correct and obvious thing. Scaling always has to be considered in the context of these tradeoffs, since otherwise you could just conclude that a single trusted rack of servers could handle a kazillion transactions per second.

    &gt; There's a post by myself on the mailing list from a few weeks back outlining the types of evidence you might need to show a blocksize increase is safe too. (Just about to start a meeting or I'd dig it up for you)
    &gt; Equally, my treechains work is work on figuring out how to raise the blocksize limit...

The problem with Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT is that its solution to congestion is *both* untested and dubious. What's worse is that it represents a hard&amp;nbsp;fork; Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT is merely an altcoin that copies over Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain with the hope that *everybody* will switch to it... that's an *idiot's* approach to upgrading a decentralized system!
Maybe Satoshi did intend for another hard fork to fix block sizes—before Bitcoin was managing billions of dollars in assets, before the world was keeping close watch, and before anyone had even conceived of a more sophisticated way than a hard fork to update the overall system, such as 2-way pegged sidechains.
The whole issue should just be avoided by keeping discordant consensus systems (ones that together would initiate a hard fork) *explicitly* separate, at most linked only *explicitly* through something like a 2-way peg.
Why should there ever be fear of a fork? Why should anyone ever be forced onto a system that has yet to prove itself?
The only missing piece is figuring out objective criteria and an explicit protocol for pinching off a sidechain to become the "main" chain with as little disruption as possible—but even a hard fork to do so will be much more trivial, because the sidechain's functionality and acceptance will have been tested in the wild.

The whole point behind Bitcoin is that truth is whatever the Bitcoin network confirms as being truth, and that a confirmation gets compounded over time with confirmations of confirmations.
*By definition*, a transaction without any confirmation should be treated as meaningless.

* It is a [straw man]( to suggest that not lifting the limit is being proposed. As [u/nullc]( has been pointing out, there are other, more sophisticated proposals for dealing with ***not&amp;nbsp;only*** blocksize changes, but other alterations to the consensus algorithm.
    The problem, as many have pointed out, is that causing a **hard&amp;nbsp;fork** in the blockchain is very bad policy.
    * A **soft fork** is such that the "losing" minority will automatically keep updated to the "winning" majority's work, because the majority's work is still valid to the minority; it's just that the minority's work may not be valid to the majority.
        Essentially, the minority has already agreed to the majority; the existing contract allows for this. This is unlike a **hard&amp;nbsp;fork**, where at least two factions never agree on a longest chain.
    * A **hard fork** is a state of existence outside of any contract. The ones with the biggest guns win, regardless of whether they are correct. **It&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;war**; may those on the other side go fuck themselves.
* As [u/nullc has pointed out]( it's not at all clear, really, that the original plan implies, say, Gavin's solution:
    &gt; You talk a lot about the creator of the system, but you haven't spoken to him-- and I doubt you know what he'd think about today. He was no fool on time based temporary limits, having -- in fact-- coded ones into the software (e.g. the change to introduce checksums into the version handshake was pre-staged with a two year timer on it); had the system's creator intended it to just be like that for the block size it could have been; and if that party though their name ought to be invoked here presumably they'd invoke it themselves rather than have you continually do so without their consent... Ultimately: It makes perfect sense to change how block limits work, when the system has the capacity handle it, no disagreements on that one; but it cannot handle the things done by some of these proposals (even if 8MB is debatable; 8192MB is not; and trends have weight in discussion but aren't natural law-- doubly so exponential ones).
* So, increasing the block size *possibly* damages *at&amp;nbsp;least* one desired property of Bitcoin: Decentralization of mining power; this has to do with the current state of hardware, and so that damage may be mitigated over time as hardware improves, yet it is not clear *now* that it's a good idea to change the limit, and its even less clear exactly *how* that limit should be changed.
    *NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE WHAT THE BEST APPROACH SHOULD BE, AND EVERYONE IS AFRAID WE'RE GOING TO FUCK UP THE EXPERIMENT!*
    **What do we do when nobody knows for sure? We run more experiments!** We leave it to the market to decide, so that the market converges on a workable solution (not necessarily the *best*) with as little loss as possible.
    A hard fork does not meet that requirement, and setting the precedent of using hard forks to make such changes irrevocably damages Bitcoin's property of having a predictable history; precedent will mean that there will always be the threat of an unstable history.
    Thus, to avoid a hard fork means to use a soft fork, or to invent a new currency with the new properties. A soft fork will not work in cases such as increasing the limit on the block size, so a new currency must be created instead.
    The trick is to couple the new currency to the old currency in a predictable way; for a traditional example, a government may create a new currency and then tell everybody that he needs to exchange his old currency at a particular exchange rate. This is what a **sidechain** allows for cryptocurrencies, and because anybody can create a sidechain, **this approach opens up the problem to the free market, just as desired!**
    **Logic has made the path clear: The sidechain is the suitable path forward now and *forever*&amp;nbsp;**

When AOL first introduced an actual WWW browser into its system, most people thought it was worthless; there was no website worth visiting; they all had flashing, scrolling text, and terrible GIFs, and loaded slowly; you couldn't even find web pages easily, because there was no automated search engine.

Now, it turns out, that those exporters basically aren't going to get paid, so they're no longer going to ship their food to Greece; they're going to ship their food to people who can actually afford it.
This is not a matter of people falling into an illusion of frozen credit, but rather people falling *out* of an illusion of liquid credit.

EDIT: Facts don't care about karma.


* It was expected that approximately 95% of the hashpower would be pushing forward on the new consensus rules, but it turned out *not* to be 95% at all! Miners were advertising themselves as being in support of the new rules, but were in fact computing for the old rules—and not just because they didn't upgrade, but because they were hashing blindly without verifying *anything!* At some point, the old rules actually had a *majority* of hashing power behind them, and this only got *partially* fixed by centralized command and control of the situation.
    **This is a major failure of Bitcoin**; a soft fork should at worst endanger the income of a very small minority of miners, but this debacle has endangered the economic activity of users who shouldn't care anything about soft forks—it would seem, now, that a user will never know whether he should wait 6 confirmations or *36* confirmations, unless he keeps tabs on the advice of various centralized "authorities"!
    *This applies to full nodes as well!*  
Wallet software that at one point was considered to operate as a "full node", the most secure kind of wallet, is also affected; as [has pointed out]( "Soft-forks make non-upgraded full nodes into slightly SPV-security-based until they upgrade".
    **The Takeaway: At any moment, your software could become a very insecure wallet; *currently*, you won't know unless you check centralized authorities regularly.**
    That takeaway is a fucking disaster for Bitcoin.
    Ironically—against the very insight that underpins Bitcoin—the powers-that-be scheduled the system to run according to the *promises* of various third parties, miners simply *saying* that they'll do some verification; the system was set in motion along a path determined by *faith* and *trust* in the rightful behavior of essentially unknown entities. Behold the outcome of lacking ***sufficient*** Proof of Work!
    It must never be forgotten that incompetence can—and frequently does—result in the same outcome as malevolence. It must be guarded against with the exact same vigilance and paranoia.
    This is a major fuck up that should make everyone worried about whether an update can be adequately controlled.
* The problem is larger. [As nullc wrote](
    &gt; Three months ago I discovered a miner with ~1% of the hashrate that was processing transactions with no signature validation at all. If I had sent that miner a transaction where I spent a million of other people's bitcoins they would have mined it and the half of the non-verifying miners would likely have given it 6+ confirms for any SPV client; and thats the more fundamental issue here which no amount of version checking would help with.

 I don't know what you mean by "change the subject"; you probably just don't understand me for whatever reason—maybe the analogy inexplicably escapes you.
A hard fork is a matter of software disagreement. What could you possibly mean by "consensus is achieved" if not by everyone updating their software? Nobody really gives a shit about block sizes or *anything*; they just want to send and receive their bitcoin for free and without trouble—that's easier said than done: Imagine a world in which a billion people are using Bitcoin, with many varieties of mining, verifying, and lightweight software... good luck hard forking that! It's bad enough *now*, what with billions of dollars at risk and a fledgling economy of skeptics and fools who don't know what the fuck they're doing, and will gladly blame Bitcoin for their own ineptitude.
Yes, Garzik—like most blowhards who have a much loftier position than they deserve—is pointing out a fact that everybody knows, and then miraculously being credited with having bestowed upon "the community" some kind of amazing insight.
Code is King.
I cannot stop a sufficiently motivated mob of proles from instigating a hard fork, but I can warn you that even if such a mob succeeds, it will have forever marred Bitcoin with the need to keep abreast of software developments for fear of being left behind by some abrupt, bloody revolution.

That's the entire point.
Transaction volume *must* grow, but doing so through blocks of an increased size is *not* sufficient! So, what now? You'd like to cause a hard fork for a solution that is in fact *not* a solution?


You're making assumptions about how an overlay network would work; there's no fundamental reason why users couldn't retain control of settled coins just as they do now, making the overlay network simply a cheaper (though less secure) medium for handling everyday purchases.


If that is true, then it would only spur adoption naturally, as it becomes too expensive to send every little transaction directly on the Bitcoin blockchain where they logistically don't belong. There's no reason to store for all time a highly secure record of your coffee purchase.


A hard fork is *not* a non-event; it is a changing of the contract to which users agreed already. It requires keeping up-to-date with centralized developments. You must update your software, or face economic loss. It's a disastrous policy; it's an *idiot's* approach to upgrading a decentralized system, especially when the "upgrade" is unproven.
@_date: 2015-08-05 16:20:23

* &gt; but the code to turn this into action and actually stop mining on them was missing or broken.
    A huge number of miners don't even validate anything; they just hash blindly; that's *why* there was a problem. Do you understand this? Do you understand how frightening that is?
    Why do you think they might do this?
* Under a soft fork, the new rules are acceptable to the old miners, but the old rules are not acceptable to the new miners; the 2 camps stabilize around one history, and the minority miners are signaled of their situation by the orphaning. The problem here is that a higher probability of reorganization diminishes security (a confirmation isn't as strong as it used to be), and supposedly verifying nodes become SPV clients with respect to the new feature.
    Under a hard fork, there are simply 2 different camps, and each eventually rejects the history of the other... *forever*. The only signal the minority camp receives is that it's taking a lot longer for confirmations to arrive, but that changes as the difficulty adjusts amogst the old miners; otherwise, they are still making block rewards, and fees; they are essentially oblivious.
    But, that's not even the problem.
    Because there are 2 histories, people will become very confused. SPV clients might be switched to the new blockchain, but merchants (who are more likely to use verifying nodes) might be on the old blockchain. Payments won't be received, because according to one history, they are invalid, or double spends might be made, because there are 2 histories at play.
    *Fine*. Fine. People eventually figure out what's going on and "upgrade" their software to avoid *further* difficulties in interacting with the economic majority. Yet, at what loss? How much economic activity must be forgotten and written off in throwing out the old blockchain in favor of the new?
    Again: Bitcoin will never be on a firm foundation as long as there is the possibility of a hard fork (and a soft fork is not much better); the only right thing to do is to let each system stand on its own (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, etc.), but create explicit paths between them with what's called a 2-way peg, so that users can transfer their coins from one system to the other.
@_date: 2015-07-23 03:31:02
The security of the pegging mechanism can be made arbitrarily strong. It cannot be stated any more clearly than that.
A sidechain need not remain even semi-trusted; in fact, it's possible to define the sidechain from the very beginning to swap between a set of federated servers, pure merge mining, and a completely independent set of miners, depending on the current hashrate spent on securing its blockchain.

Soft forks are dangerous. Hard forks are disastrous.
A hard fork is like creating an entirely new system and then just telling nearly everyone they've got to adopt it explicitly; a soft fork can devolve into virtually a hard fork.
The proper solution is to issue one more soft fork to allow for creating sidechains; a sidechain is a new system into which—*and out of which*—control can be transferred, voluntarily, and according to the free market and optimized by market makers. Then, any future change should be introduced in a sidechain to which people can slowly, carefully, and voluntarily transfer their coins.

    The point is to cultivate a culture that respects stable, well-conducted transitions that are open to the forces of a free market; why would you choose a hard fork to route around damage, when you can choose a sidechain to which people can migrate at will, and without the permission of the "main" chain?
* &gt; Because they didn't think their incentives through
    That's not an answer to the question posed.
    &gt; They lost money on their orphaned blocks, more than the money needed to pay for a full node to pull them back in line.
    Again, there were times when the *majority* hashing power was behind the pre-BIP66 rules; therefore, the incentive to fix the problem couldn't have been because they were losing money, because they could have just abandoned the switch and kept going with the pre-BIP66 blockchain; the incentive had to be something more akin to a desire actually to see BIP66 succeed.
* &gt; the overall architecture, done by Satoshi, makes Bitcoin work. Which, by the way, is beyond just the scope of computer science.
    A bitcoin node is a git repo with an automated committer scripted in a forth-like language, a bittorrent client to keep all the clones synchronized with automated pull requests, and hashcash as the anti-spam algorithm.
    There. One sentence, let alone 8 pages.
    -------------------
    The main thrust of Bitcoin was written in 8 pages of easy reading, which indicates that there was already plenty of structure on which to build Bitcoin.
    All of the constituent parts were already lying around and well understood, including:
    * Merkle trees (think of git, which stores a decentralized, distributed history that is increasingly difficult to alter).
    * decentralized self-bootstrapping peer-to-peer networks (think of bittorrent).
    * an anti-spam mechanism (hashcash, which was invented before and is a fundamental component of Bitcoin).
    * well understood public key cryptography; [Satoshi wasn't well versed in cryptography](
    * decades of research into digital currencies.
    * decades of research into stack-based scripting languages for efficient, constrained computing environments (think of forth).
    * a widespread Internet and cheap computing.
    * a growing mobile computing space.
    * the rise of libertarian politics and economics amidst a burgeoning global financial crisis.
    Bitcoin's whitepaper was short, because Bitcoin was imminent; it didn't take much new insight to throw it together.
    **If it hadn't been Satoshi, it would have been someone else.** Just like with regard to calculus: If it hadn't been Newton, it would have been Leibniz, or one of the many other people working on similar thinking. If it hadn't been Charles Darwin, it would have been Alfred Russel Wallace, whose own work forced Darwin to publish his book so as not to lose the credit. If it hadn't been Einstein, it would have been any other daydreamer who thought to play with different axioms after the failure of the Michelson–Morley experiment, etc.

NONSENSE. Why are so many of you so bloody delusional?
**Don't get me wrong. I love Bitcoin. However, we must be realistic.**
According to [this analysis of real-world data]( "the average bitcoin transaction data size has grown to roughly 600 bytes".
In a completely full 100&amp;nbsp;MB block, you could get 166666 transactions of an average nature; that's 277.8 transactions per second. *Bwahahahahaaaaaaaa!!!!1111* [Visa handles]( an average of 2000 transactions per second, and a peak capacity of 56&amp;nbsp;000 transactions per second!
What's worse is that even a 100&amp;nbsp;MB block is completely out of the question, unless you don't mind the possibility of extreme centralization.
Transactions must be consolidated by a standardized overlay network, and placed into Bitcoin as a settlement transaction; the occasional power user may, of&amp;nbsp;course, place a transaction directly into Bitcoin's blockchain if desired.

Well, there's lots of software for generating private keys and the associated public keys, and any generic software for creating QR codes can be used for generating scannable addresses and the like.
You'd probably want to create a master private key and then just create new private keys deterministically from that, so that you don't have to keep track of a bunch of private keys. This would probably also reduce the strain on your server's entropy pool.
In my opinion, a better solution is probably something like Stealth Addresses or Payment Codes, both of which provide a way to display just *one* address, but still receive payments at different Bitcoin addresses known only to you and the sender. Unfortunately, these concepts are not yet widely implemented.
**TL;DR:** You don't need a wallet to generate private keys and their associated Bitcoin addresses; it should be relatively easy to cobble together a system on your own, because it's all just data.

They have said that, because the prominent idea has been a merge-mined sidechain, which can only ever be as secure as the network that is merge-mining, which is the Bitcoin network. Moreover, if you're pegging to the bitcoin, then the primary incentive is to mine Bitcoin, because of its massive subsidy through a block reward—that dynamic is not so clear as the block reward diminishes.
However, it's important to realize that it's impossible to compare security unless you're talking about shared characteristics.
* If the characteristic is low trust in any particular miner, then convincing people to mine a sidechain is as tough as convincing people to mine Bitcoin, and given Bitcoin's network effect, you'll probably always lag Bitcoin in hashing power.
* If the characteristic is medium-to-high trust, then a sidechain for purchasing coffee with blocks co-signed by a federated network of servers provided by a majority of every major coffee company on the planet is probably going to be much more secure with fewer resources—security is not just a matter of avoiding good actors becoming bad actors; it's a matter of being resistant to obviously bad outsiders.

In essence, Bitcoin XT is an altcoin that is being bootstrapped on Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain; Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT is *copying* the state of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core users' holdings, and then just hoping people switch to using Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT instead.
You have to think in terms of the blockchain that each peer will see; because there are two blockchains, they can become out of sync, and the lack of synchronization can be used to make double spends and a great deal of confusion, including the loss of economic history.
That is, a hard fork is the same thing as creating an altcoin and then just telling everybody to switch to it.
Bitcoin will never be on a firm foundation as long as there is the possibility of a hard&amp;nbsp;fork; the only right thing to do is to let each system stand on its own (Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core, Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT, etc.), but create explicit paths between them with what's called a 2-way peg, so that users can transfer their coins from one system to the other.
This would be achieved by making Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT a sidechain of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core; in that case, Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT would *still* be an altcoin, but it would start with a brand new blockchain that is coupled to Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain, and only Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core would be allowed to create new coins.
As time goes by, if Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT becomes the de&amp;nbsp;facto "Bitcoin", it would be possible to pinch off Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT, copy over the rest of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain, and then have Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT continue the minting process; even if this requires a hard fork, it would be much more trivial.

* &gt; At the moment it seems like "consensus" is getting on the side of block size increase and just for the record im in support of that.
    There's virtually nobody who doesn't support an increase. The question is how it should be increased, including not only the size, but the method; some of us think that the system should avoid breaking user expectations as much as possible. For instance, it's actually possible to address the issue without a hard fork via "extension&amp;nbsp;blocks".
    Upgrade by hard fork is going to be increasingly impractical, and doing it at all really sets a kind of bad precedent, anyway.
* &gt; If they can change the block size then the most logical thing for them is to optimize the size for **highest total block fees.**
    Here is the problem that you are neglecting: You cannot mandate security; that is, you cannot mandate a hashrate.
    Who is to say that a given hashrate is high enough to actually secure the network from the meddling of a special interest?
    Indeed, what is the *minimum* hashrate required to secure the network? After the next block-reward halving, will the mining industry *still* produce a hashrate that is above that minimum?
    How can you communicate to the users of Bitcoin what this minimum hashrate is? **Who is going to pay for maintaining that minimum hashrate, and how will they pay?**
    As the block reward diminishes, the only way to keep the hashrate high *and* transaction fees cheap is by dramatically increasing the volume of transactions; yet, by&amp;nbsp;itself, increasing the block size scales the volume of transactions very *very* poorly.
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:07:06
You are assuming that the block size limit is significantly artificial, or that an increase in the effective block size limit won't be deleterious to the topology of the network.
Based on these massive assumptions, you want to shock the system with a hard fork. It is bad policy to require users of a supposedly decentralized system to keep tabs on the latest software development.
If you want people to switch to your altcoin, then set up a 2-way peg and let people transfer their assets to your new system, so that at least before any hard fork, your system will have proved itself in some kind of wild.

You are proposing majority rule.
Yet, Bitcoin isn't about majority rule; rather, Bitcoin is about decentralization of power.
The premise of Bitcoin is merely that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or catastrophically incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though, as you point out, Bitcoin's design doesn't guarantee it.
That is, Bitcoin is designed on the assumption that the collection of miners is dominated by general interests (as opposed to a special interest), and that the hashrate is sufficiently high to prevent any special interest from gaining significant authority.
**General interests, typically, aren't too sophisticated, and they become dumber as a mob mentality is fomented.** If anything, Bitcoin is based on the assumption that the original ideas of Bitcoin are pretty darn smart and that a bunch of independent people are too disorganized to collude to change the rules easily.
So, for Bitcoin to be sufficiently decentralized, Bitcoin must be managed by enough people such that they are too disorganized to effect much change. Otherwise, what's the point of Bitcoin?

* Maybe Satoshi did intend for another hard fork to fix block sizes—before Bitcoin was managing billions of dollars in assets, before the world was keeping close watch, and before anyone had even conceived of a more sophisticated way than a hard fork to update the overall system, such as 2-way pegged sidechains.
    Adam Back, the man behind Bitcoin's fundamental building block (hashcash), came up with sidechains specifically as a way to upgrade the system smoothly.
    There are minds as great as (if not greater than) Satoshi. Listen to them.
* Recall the BIP66 soft fork, when there was a huge sticky post at the top of warning people to wait *30*&amp;nbsp;more confirmations than usual. During that soft fork, there were times at which a *majority* of the mining power was put on the pre-BIP66 blockchain, despite the miners having advertised a vast majority in support of BIP66—what an utter failure!
    A huge number of miners don't even validate anything; they just hash blindly; that's *why* there was a problem. Do you understand this? Do you understand how frightening that is?
    Why do you think they might do this?
* Under a soft fork, the new rules are acceptable to the old miners, but the old rules are not acceptable to the new miners; the 2 camps stabilize around one history, and the minority miners are signaled of their situation by the orphaning. The problem here is that a higher probability of reorganization diminishes security (a confirmation isn't as strong as it used to be), and supposedly verifying nodes become SPV clients with respect to the new feature.
    Under a hard fork, there are simply 2 different camps, and each eventually rejects the history of the other... *forever*. The only signal the minority camp receives is that it's taking a lot longer for confirmations to arrive, but that changes as the difficulty adjusts amogst the old miners; otherwise, they are still making block rewards, and fees; they are essentially oblivious.
    But, that's not even the problem.
    Because there are 2 histories, people will become very confused. SPV clients might be switched to the new blockchain, but merchants (who are more likely to use verifying nodes) might be on the old blockchain. Payments won't be received, because according to one history, they are invalid, or double spends might be made, because there are 2 histories at play.
    *Fine*. Fine. People eventually figure out what's going on and "upgrade" their software to avoid *further* difficulties in interacting with the economic majority. Yet, at what loss? How much economic activity must be forgotten and written off in throwing out the old blockchain in favor of the new?
    Again: Bitcoin will never be on a firm foundation as long as there is the possibility of a hard fork (and a soft fork is not much better); the only right thing to do is to let each system stand on its own (Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, etc.), but create explicit paths between them with what's called a 2-way peg, so that users can transfer their coins from one system to the other.
@_date: 2015-07-24 20:01:13

* It was expected that approximately 95% of the hashpower would be pushing forward on the new consensus rules, but it turned out *not* to be 95% at all! Miners were advertising themselves as being in support of the new rules, but were in fact computing for the old rules—and not just because they didn't upgrade, but because they were hashing blindly without verifying *anything!* At some point, the old rules actually had a *majority* of hashing power behind them, and this only got *partially* fixed by centralized command and control of the situation.
    **This is a major failure of Bitcoin**; a soft fork should at worst endanger the income of a very small minority of miners, but this debacle has endangered the economic activity of users who shouldn't care anything about soft forks—it would seem, now, that a user will never know whether he should wait 6 confirmations or *36* confirmations, unless he keeps tabs on the advice of various centralized "authorities"!
    *This applies to full nodes as well!*  
Wallet software that at one point was considered to operate as a "full node", the most secure kind of wallet, is also affected; as [nullc has pointed out]( "Soft-forks make non-upgraded full nodes into slightly SPV-security-based until they upgrade".
    **The Takeaway: At any moment, your software could become a very insecure wallet; *currently*, you won't know unless you check centralized authorities regularly.**
    That takeaway is a fucking disaster for Bitcoin.
    Ironically—against the very insight that underpins Bitcoin—the powers-that-be scheduled the system to run according to the *promises* of various third parties, miners simply *saying* that they'll do some verification; the system was set in motion along a path determined by *faith* and *trust* in the rightful behavior of essentially unknown entities. Behold the outcome of lacking ***sufficient*** Proof of Work!
    It must never be forgotten that incompetence can—and frequently does—result in the same outcome as malevolence. It must be guarded against with the exact same vigilance and paranoia.
    This is a major fuck up that should make everyone worried about whether an update can be adequately controlled.
* The problem is larger. [As nullc wrote](
    &gt; Three months ago I discovered a miner with ~1% of the hashrate that was processing transactions with no signature validation at all. If I had sent that miner a transaction where I spent a million of other people's bitcoins they would have mined it and the half of the non-verifying miners would likely have given it 6+ confirms for any SPV client; and thats the more fundamental issue here which no amount of version checking would help with.

There's no way to determine that every peer has accepted a transaction! Your definition of "well-formed" is utterly useless.

* During the BIP66 soft fork, there were times at which a *majority* of the mining power was put on the pre-BIP66 blockchain, despite the miners having advertised a vast majority in support of BIP66—what an utter failure!
    Therefore, the incentive to fix the problem couldn't have been because they were losing money, because they could have just abandoned the switch and kept going with the pre-BIP66 blockchain; the incentive had to be something more akin to a desire actually to see BIP66 succeed.
* Regardless of whether the block-size limit must be altered, Bitcoin will never be on a firm foundation as long as there is the possibility of a hard&amp;nbsp;fork; the only right thing to do is to let each system stand on its own (Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core, Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT, etc.), but create explicit paths between them with what's called a 2-way peg, so that users can transfer their coins from one system to the other.
    This would be achieved by making Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT a [sidechain]( of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core; in that case, Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT would *still* be an altcoin, but it would start with a brand new blockchain that is coupled to Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain (instead of just having a copy of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain), and only Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core would be allowed to create new coins.
    As time goes by, if Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT becomes the de&amp;nbsp;facto "Bitcoin", it would be possible to pinch off Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT, copy over the rest of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain, and then have Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT continue the minting process; even if this requires a hard fork, it would be much more trivial—at least because the new system will have proved itself.
    A hard fork is the same thing as creating an altcoin bootstrapped on an existing blockchain and then just telling everybody to switch to it; unless virtually everybody has already switched, triggering a hard fork when billions are at risk is insanity.

Bitcoin has had hard forks when it was worth nothing, and had little attention on it. Bitcoin has had hard forks when no one had yet conceived of something more sophisticated, like sidechains.
**Sidechains do not require a hard fork in bitcoin; only a soft fork is required.** Even without a soft fork, federated pegs will probably do nicely for nascent alterations.
In fact, if you support *re*-introducing the more expressive Bitcoin script ops that Satoshi removed—that is, you envision Bitcoin being able to handle smart contracts—then you support sidechain development, because it would then be possible to implement sidechains as smart contracts entirely without Bitcoin's permission.


What does that even mean? Hashcash is a fundamental algorithm of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin can be upgraded in one of 2 ways:
* Gradually via 2-way pegged sidechains, culminating in—at&amp;nbsp;worst—an extremely trivial hard fork, but maybe not even a hard fork.

It's a maddening failure of Bitcoin that you must always be vigilant about upgrading to the "latest" code at all times; that's a requirement to be plugged into centralized choreography, an outcome Bitcoin is meant to avoid, and which a soft fork in particular is designed to avoid—the whole point of a soft fork is that old clients still work with a very minimal hit to security during the transition.
This transition failed on all counts: It significantly disrupted users' security to the point that even supposed "full nodes" were rendered inadequate, and it required centralized choreography to fix *partially*; unless the debacle can be provable avoided in the future, it means one must always be plugged into the centralized powers-that-be, either through keeping tabs on upgrading, or watching out for warning announcements.

**Nope. Even if you don't pay a transaction fee, you are paying through the inflationary process known as the "block reward".**
When the block reward stops, will you even be able to get a transaction processed without a transaction fee? I don't know, but if you can, it will be because others are essentially paying for you, as a kind of subsidy for the good behavior of keeping your transactions in good enough order to be considered "high priority".
Thus, you're *always* paying bitcoin to interact with the third-party payment processor that is known as the "Bitcoin network"; you pay that bitcoin to induce the network to modify the data structure known as the "Bitcoin blockchain"—after all, there is no transformation in the universe that doesn't require resources to be achieved.

* A hard fork is unacceptable (it is war, a state of existence without any kind of guiding contract other than an ultimatum), and a soft fork has recently proven to be dangerous (virtually requiring an ultimatum, anyway). For upgrades, then, the only solution is to create an entirely new system, coupled to the old system as a "sidechain", thereby allowing users to transfer their resources voluntarily to the sidechain of their choosing.
    Just one more soft fork is required to make sidechains a reality, and then there should never again be a hard fork or even a soft fork.
* A Bitcoin with forks (even soft ones) is less secure by design; at any moment, even your supposed "full node" can be converted into an SPV client with respect to some soft fork, and then suffer security-destroying reorganizations of the blockchain—the only solution is to keep updated to the latest software all the time, which requires being plugged into centralized choreography, just like with hard forks.
    A sidechain is not less secure if it becomes popular enough to have significant mining resources behind it. Before that point, security can be achieved with the more centralized approach of federated functionaries, and embedding within the "main" chain, and all manner of other approaches and overlays to get a nascent system up and running.
    Sidechains open up changes to the mechanisms of a free market.

[From the link]( "Our analysis indicates that for compensation per block to remain constant after the next halving event, fees would have to increase to ~$4.6 per transaction (from 4 cents today) if transaction volumes and \[BTC\] price remain unchanged."


Given the same transaction volume and BTC price, it would seem logical that the transaciton fees would have to account for 50% more than they did at 12.5&amp;nbsp;BTC, so ~$6.9 per transaction.
Of course, such fees will never happen. Instead, the BTC price will rise, and the mining industry will probably shrink; as time goes by, the price will rise less and less, and the mining industry will shrink more and more.
Hopefully, transaction *volume* can increase to spread the costs across more people.
It should be noted that according to [the same analysis of real-world data]( "the average bitcoin transaction data size has grown to roughly 600 bytes".
Thus, in a completely full 100&amp;nbsp;MB block, you could get 166666 transactions of an average nature; that's 277.8 transactions per second. *Bwahahahahaaaaaaaa!!!!1111* [Visa handles]( an average of 2000 transactions per second, and a peak capacity of 56&amp;nbsp;000 transactions per second!
What's worse is that even a 100&amp;nbsp;MB block is completely out of the question, unless you don't mind the possibility of extreme centralization, especially given that mining industry is already being paid the equivalent of a completely full 80&amp;nbsp;MB block and yet whine about an increase in the block size from 1&amp;nbsp;MB.
Transactions must be consolidated by a standardized overlay network, and placed into Bitcoin as a settlement transaction; the occasional power user may, of&amp;nbsp;course, place a transaction directly into Bitcoin's blockchain if desired—after all, again, it's far more important to secure a collection of 100 thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee.

The point of this post is to think about the present state of mining and how (or whether) it can be maintained.

It's centralized, but in a way that even enemies would agree to work together.
It's immensely and widely auditable, because that's the task at which blockchain data structures excel.
It allows some hope of escaping the sidechain's control by allowing for the transfer of assets back to the control of Bitcoin.

That's a hard fork mentality. The whole point of a soft fork is that the system remains pretty darn stable *even if users and a minority of miners do not upgrade*. Indeed, a user shouldn't have to upgrade at all, because a user should lose a fairly insignificant amount of security during the transition.

Your "solution" makes *no* sense.
A **hard fork** is disasterous, and a **soft&amp;nbsp;fork** has proven to be dangerous, as it has the potential to devolve into a kind of hard fork (and, ***at&amp;nbsp;best*** reduces security for a time due to increased reorganization probability).
**The real solution is clear:** One and only one more *soft* fork to allow for 2-way pegs (sidechains); then, there are no more forks of any kind, as all future improvements become a matter of users choosing voluntarily to transfer control of their assets from one system to another. At the very worst, the new system can make a hard fork to copy over the old system's blockchain entirely, begin minting coins itself, and thus leave behind the old system; that kind of hard fork is much less dangerous.
Making a hard fork is creating a new system, and just telling *everyone* in the supposedly decentralized system to switch over to the new system; at the very least, verifying nodes must upgrade, and must therefore be subscribed to centralized choreography.
A 2-way peg allows people to switch at any time between 2 systems (i.e., between 2 hard forks). If you're going to have a hard fork, the right way is to do it with a 2-way peg, so that people can upgrade *or&amp;nbsp;downgrade* almost at leisure.
* You want new properties for Bitcoin, so that requires making a new system called Bitcoin2.0 that uses the same Bitcoin blockchain (with feature extensions, as necessary), and then getting everyone to upgrade their software accordingly. That's a **hard&amp;nbsp;fork**, and it's disastrous (at least from a policy point of view).
    This is making a new altcoin and then telling everyone to move over to it; your new altcoin is simply bootstrapped with an existing blockchain. Mining support is not well known, and whether the altcoin functions as intended is also unknown.
* A **sidechain** Bitcoin2.0 is basically a hard fork Bitcoin2.0 as described above, except you don't copy the old Blockchain over to the new system; instead, you couple a *new* blockchain to the old one by means of a 2-way peg, and then disable the creation of new coins, deferring solely to the old system to continue that task.
    Thereby, upgrading becomes an explicit act of the user, either by transferring control of his Bitcoin coins directly to the Bitcoin2.0 system, or by swapping Bitcoin coins for Bitcoin2.0 coins with someone coming the other direction.
    The new properties can be tested, and the Bitcoin2.0 system built slowly until it proves itself; hopefully, lots of people and miners will transfer to the Bitcoin2.0 system as it becomes apparent that it's a good system.
    Eventually, the decision can be made to **hard&amp;nbsp;fork** Bitcoin2.0 to copy over the rest of the original Bitcoin blockchain and continue the minting process (if any). At that point, the hard fork is much more trivial, because there is known mining support, and it is known whether Bitcoin2.0 functions as intended.

* A hard fork is not an upgrade; it's war—may the losing side go fuck itself, quite possibly through the loss of significant economic activity, as well as damage to the image of Bitcoin as a stable system bound by rules to which people agree up&amp;nbsp;front.
* 2-way pegs are well understood; the best way to run a sidechain is not yet well understood. However, the "main" chain is protected from any fuck&amp;nbsp;up in running the sidechain; the same cannot be said when the alternate chain is a hard&amp;nbsp;fork.
    How can you not see the difference?
* Nobody is forced to use a sidechain, and if they don't trust its governance, etc., they can escape to the system that has already proved itself by transferring control of coins back to the "main" chain.

    &gt; I don't think, and I don't think Petertodd thinks smaller blocks are in independent virtue without considering the size relative to demand/fees, computational resources, and bandwidth resources. E.g. if magically overnight CPUs everywhere because 10x faster, bandwidth became 10x faster, disks became 10x bigger, and demand at a given fee rate when up 10x... then larger blocks would be the correct and obvious thing. Scaling always has to be considered in the context of these tradeoffs, since otherwise you could just conclude that a single trusted rack of servers could handle a kazillion transactions per second.

Indeed. However, certain outcomes are more likely than others.
I actually discuss this extensively at the other end of [the link that is provided in that paragraph](
For instance, at the next halving, the USD price per BTC will have to basically double if nothing else changes. And, as stated in the post above: "With regard to the Lightning Network, such an overlay (or something like it) is the *only* way that Bitcoin can scale, and Bitcoin must be scaled in order to be self-sustaining; the volume of transactions must grow tremendously in order for Bitcoin usage to be both cheap and secure."
At the other end of the link, it is pointed out that as the block reward decreases, the mining industry as it currently exists can only be sustained if at least one of the following statements is true:
1. The price of BTC increases significantly.
2. The average transaction fee increases significantly.
3. The number of transactions of an average nature increases significantly.
4. The block reward is not decreased so much, or never goes away; that is, the 21&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;BTC cap is broken.
It is observed that `2.` (increased fees) is out of the question, leaving `1.` (increased price), `3.` (increased transaction count), and `4.` (increased BTC supply). However, for `1.` to be useful in the long-term, it requires `4.`, and nobody likes `4.`, so that means they are both out of the question, leaving only `3.` (increased transaction count).
Unfortunately, increasing the block size does not scale transaction count adequately. Hence, the need for an overlay that consolidates very many cheap transactions into expensive settlement transactions.
So, great, let's hard fork to a Bitcoin block size that is large enough to be useful, but not so large as to be stupid. Unfortunately, a hard fork is bad precedent, is not suitable as a general solution for improving Bitcoin, might possibly be avoided via more sophisticated mechanisms that only put at risk the capital of those who are willing to experiment, alters the hitherto successful rules of consensus, and would therefore force everyone to adopt and untested system; at the very least, a more universally agreed solution should be developed before even considering the institution of the philosophically repugnant hard fork.

That is, of course, entirely wrong.
Security is the *production* of blocks; the production of a block secures blockchain data that much more—and the elapsing of time without the production of a block *reduces* the security of that data that much more, for it is time that an assailant might be using to construct an alternative history.
Ergo, production of blocks cannot cease, and the production does not cease, because people have an incentive to produce them: Their own security *and* payment for the security of others; right now, that incentive is mainly the block reward, which forces *everyone* to pay for the service, like a tax.

In essence, Bitcoin XT is an altcoin that is being bootstrapped on Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain; Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT is *copying* the state of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core users' holdings, and then just hoping people switch to using Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT instead.
You have to think in terms of the blockchain that each peer will see; because there are two blockchains, they can become out of sync, and the lack of synchronization can be used to make double spends and a great deal of confusion, including the loss of economic history.
That is, a hard fork is the same thing as creating an altcoin and then just telling everybody to switch to it.
Bitcoin will never be on a firm foundation as long as there is the possibility of a hard&amp;nbsp;fork; the only right thing to do is to let each system stand on its own (Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core, Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT, etc.), but create explicit paths between them with what's called a 2-way peg, so that users can transfer their coins from one system to the other.
This would be achieved by making Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT a sidechain of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core; in that case, Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT would *still* be an altcoin, but it would start with a brand new blockchain that is coupled to Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain, and only Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core would be allowed to create new coins.
As time goes by, if Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT becomes the de&amp;nbsp;facto "Bitcoin", it would be possible to pinch off Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT, copy over the rest of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;Core's blockchain, and then have Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT continue the minting process; even if this requires a hard fork, it would be much more trivial.

That's not very reassuring in an economy where people intend to spend their bitcoins...
Bitcoin can be upgraded in one of 2 ways:
* Gradually via 2-way pegged sidechains, culminating in—at&amp;nbsp;worst—an extremely trivial hard fork, but maybe not even a hard fork.
* Everyone has to keep abreast of centralized developments, updating software to whatever the powers-that-be dictate.
One of these scenarios makes sense for a decentralized system; the other does not.
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:42:25
It's so much worse than that.
* The economic activity of regular users has been put in significant jeopardy while the chain is in flux; the protocol for switching on the new rules was an utter failure. 95% was *not* 95%.
    * **For a time, the majority hashing power was *in&amp;nbsp;fact* behind the old rules**, and only got fixed through centralized choreography; this is a major failure of Bitcoin's premise.
* Full node, verifying wallets can be converted into SPV-like wallets at any time, unless you keep upgraded; this is a failure of Bitcoin's attempt to be independent of significant centralized choreography.
* It was the case *before* and is the case *now* that a huge amount of the Bitcoin's hashing power is completely blind to what it's doing. This calls into question Bitcoin's ability to be a currency system; it's showing itself to be viable as only a settlement system (business can really only be done with a large number of confirmations between transactions). The problem gets worse during soft forks, which could happen without warning.

    &gt; No it was not.
    Yes, it was.
    Again, **the main thrust of Bitcoin was written in 8 pages of easy reading**, which indicates that there was already plenty of structure on which to build Bitcoin.
    Satoshi's understanding of cryptography and use thereof was minimal and sometimes decidedly naive; [Gavin Andresen](
    &gt; “Satoshi is often called a cryptographer,” the Chief Scientist for the Bitcoin Foundation said. “But I don't think he was.”
    &gt; Bitcoin uses very little cryptography, Andresen argued. It uses elliptic curve keys, ECDSA signatures, and cryptographic hashes, but that's it. Even the use of the security protocol Open SSL was “kind of naive,” he said. There was no mention of Schnorr or Lamport signatures, which Andresen argued would likely be annotated somewhere in the code even if not used.
    &gt; One quote from Nakamoto convinced Andresen that he, she, or the group, was not a cryptographer:
    &gt;&gt; “Crypto may offer 'key blinding.' I did some research and it was obscure, but there may be something there. 'Group signatures' may be related.”
    &gt; But key blinding and group signatures are concepts from Crypto 101.
    &gt; That's not to say that Bitcoin was any less ingenious. “Satoshi was a brilliant programmer,” Andresen said. “But he didn't have a deep understanding of all the cutting edge crypto research that's going on.”
    **If it hadn't been Satoshi, it would have been someone else.** Just like with regard to calculus: If it hadn't been Newton, it would have been Leibniz, or one of the many other people working on similar thinking. If it hadn't been Charles Darwin, it would have been Alfred Russel Wallace, whose own work forced Darwin to publish his book so as not to lose the credit, etc.

If I may insert myself into your discussion...
It seems to me that the whole issue should just be avoided by keeping discordant consensus systems (ones that together would initiate a hard fork) *explicitly* separate, at most linked only *explicitly* through something like a 2-way peg.
Why should there ever be fear of a fork? Why should anyone ever be forced onto a system that has yet to prove itself?
The only missing piece is figuring out objective criteria and an explicit protocol for pinching off a sidechain to become the "main" chain with as little disruption as possible—but even a hard fork to do so will be much more trivial, because the sidechain's functionality and acceptance will have been tested in the wild.

As I responded to you last time:
* &gt; Sidechains cannot be as secure as the main chain with the currently proposed 2WP architecture.
    **That's not a statement you can make.**
    The security of the pegging mechanism can be made arbitrarily strong, and beyond the pegging mechanism, a sidechain is a completely independent system; there are a number of ways to align incentives with mining the sidechain in order to thwart problems with merge-mining—indeed, merge-mining is not even a requirement.
    Even with merge-mining, a sidechain can be as secure as the main chain, and beyond merge-mining, it is perfectly possible for a side chain to be more secure than a main chain, especially when giving up some decentralization or low-trust.
    Security is not something you can easily pin down, and one of the reasons sidechains are valuable is that they can account for different use cases that require different levels of security.
    It's important to realize that it's impossible to compare security unless you're talking about shared characteristics. Certainly, for getting an upgrade of Bitcoin up and running for testing purposes, there's no reason to require security or decentralization that is as great as Bitcoin proper, at least at first.
    * If the characteristic is low trust in any particular miner, then convincing people to mine a sidechain is as tough as convincing people to mine Bitcoin, and given Bitcoin's network effect, you'll probably always lag Bitcoin in hashing power.
    * If the characteristic is medium-to-high trust, then a sidechain for purchasing coffee with blocks co-signed by a federated network of servers provided by a majority of every major coffee company on the planet is probably going to be much more secure with fewer resources—security is not just a matter of avoiding good actors becoming bad actors; it's a matter of being resistant to obviously bad outsiders.
* &gt; A hard fork to remove the 1 MB limit, which has been planned from as long ago as 2010 by Satoshi
    **Maybe Satoshi did intend for another hard fork to fix block sizes**—before managing billions of dollars in assets, before the world was keeping close watch, and before anyone had even conceived of a more sophisticated way than a hard fork to update the overall system, such as 2-way pegged sidechains.

No, that's what the block reward and fees do.
Hashcash (as implemented in Bitcoin) keeps a clear signal-to-noise ratio by making it unproductive to spam the network with bogus history. Of course, you could argue that hashcash grounds BTC value in some sort of real-world resource usage—an honest miner is going to want to be compensated for his electricity and time, etc.
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:51:36


That is emphatically not the case. How many times do I have to explain it? The problem is far worse than just not upgrading; there is a lot of hashing power that is simply not even verifying.


There is a greater risk of a reorganization...
This very situation has various authorities suggesting that people wait for up to 36 confirmations before considering a transaction truly irreversible; the underlying problems make this uncertainty possible at any time—at any time, your supposed "full node", fully verifying wallet could be converted into essentially an SPV client with regard to some soft fork feature that you didn't even know about, and an SPV client can already be confused about the most ridiculous blocks, and thus require these MUCH longer strings of confirmations. Do you read nothing I've written?
This is not a minor trouble.
Bitcoin is basically unsuitable for anything but a settlement system until this gets fixed at a fundamental level.

* Easiness has nothing to do with it; the point is that a hard fork ruins the fungibility on a given network—2 people who thought they were on the same network no longer are. With a side chain, this change in relationship is explicitly known ahead of time.
* An economy doesn't have time to wait. People will get fucked by a hard fork, because the situation is poorly defined.
    If you "merely have to wait", then the problem is no different with passing assets through a 2-way peg: Just wait for the systems to synchronize.
    Furthermore, you're just plain wrong.
    Most tokens on a sidechain will probably not be gotten through a 2-way pegging transaction, but rather through atomic, decentralized swaps of tokens, and through exchanges and the like, as there will always be people coming and going between the systems.
    With a hard fork, the risk is systemic, but with a side chain, the risk is individual.

A Bitcoin with forks (even soft ones) is less secure by design; at any moment, even your supposed "full&amp;nbsp;node" can be converted into an SPV client with respect to some soft fork, and then suffer security-destroying reorganizations of the blockchain—the only solution is to keep updated to the latest software all the time, which requires being plugged into centralized choreography, just like with hard forks.
A sidechain is not less secure if it becomes popular enough to have significant mining resources behind it. Before that point, security can be achieved with the more centralized approach of federated functionaries, and embedding with the "main" chain.
Sidechains open up changes to the mechanisms of a free market.

**TL;DR:** A hard fork to increase the block-size limit is the same as creating a new altcoin (bootstrapped on Bitcoin's blockchain), and then just telling everybody to switch to it; that's an idiot's approach to a decentralized system.
* You want new characteristics for Bitcoin (e.g., a bigger **block&amp;nbsp;size**). This requires making a new system called *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* that copies over and begins to extend the same blockchain used by *Bitcoin*; this is the same as making a new **altcoin** (boostrapped on Bitcoin's blockchain) and then just telling everyone to move over to it.
    In technical terms, doing this is called a **hard&amp;nbsp;fork**, and it's disastrous because it can split the network, and thereby destroy fungibility—people will disagree on what a bitcoin is (that is, their software will disagree); hard forks as a policy for upgrading mean that the characteristics of Bitcoin are always at risk—the contract to which people thought they had agreed can just vanish! Furthermore:
    \* User support for *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* is not well known.
    \* Mining support for *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* is not well known.
    \* Whether *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* functions as intended is also not well known.
* A **sidechain** *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* is basically a hard&amp;nbsp;fork *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* as described above, except you do *not* copy the old blockchain over to the new system; instead, you connect a *new* blockchain to the old blockchain by means of a **2-way&amp;nbsp;peg**, and then *disable* the creation of new coins, deferring solely to the old system to continue that minting process.
    To use the new *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* system, any user can simply *choose* at his leisure to transfer control of his assets from the old *Bitcoin* system to the new *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* system; if he wants to return to the old system, he can do that, too!
    This transfer of control back and forth can either be explicit or implicit:
    * The explicit approach requires no counterparty; it uses the transaction mechanisms of the 2 systems. However, it is a slow process, because security requires, essentially, many confirmations in order to synchronize the 2 systems.
    * The implicit approach requires a counterparty; it involves exchanging the assets of one system for assets of the other system—but possibly with the security of atomic swaps, because both systems are digital and cryptographic; this could be very fast and cheap, and would facilitate an influx of new users who want to *try* out the new system.
    In the beginning, people will move their coins to the new system to get access to its new features, and then move back to the old system for the sake of security; as time goes on, people will just use the new system almost all the time; eventually, they'll use the new system *all* the time.
    Thereby, the new characteristics (e.g., larger blocks, etc.) can be *tested*, and the *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* system can therefore be built *slowly* until it *proves&amp;nbsp;itself*; hopefully, eventually, lots of people and miners will transfer to the *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* system as it becomes apparent that it's a good system.
    If *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* is successful, the decision can be made to **hard&amp;nbsp;fork** *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* to copy over the rest of the original *Bitcoin* blockchain and continue the minting process; this makes it an altcoin to which virtually everyone has *already* moved! Yet, isn't that hard&amp;nbsp;fork what everyone was trying to avoid in the first place? Well, at that point, the hard&amp;nbsp;fork is much more trivial, because:
    \* It is known how well the economy supports the new system.
    \* It is known how well the mining industry supports the new system.
    \* It is known whether *Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;2.0* actually functions as intended.

The word "laid" is the past tense of "to lay", which takes a direct object: To lay the foundation for Bitcoin; Satoshi laid the foundation for Bitcoin.
The word "lay" that is in question is the past tense of "to lie", which is intransitive: To lie upon a bed of bitcoins; after he had mined the first few blocks, Satoshi printed out a pile of paper wallets and lay upon his bed of bitcoins, dreaming of a glorious tomorrow.
So, the past tense of "to lie" is "lay" (and its past participle is "lain"), and the past tense of "to lay" is "laid". As you can see, it's very confusing, which is why *no&amp;nbsp;body* uses these words properly, particularly Americans, who rarely understand exactly what they're saying, anyway.
Mostly you'll hear people say "laid" (and often spell it "layed"!), but those people are wrong. The word "lay" as the past tense of "to lie" is all but dead; in fact, the word "to lie" is all but dead. Yet, it's still what's correct.

It's worth noting that the more decentralized mining becomes, the cheaper the transaction fees become.
Right now, mining takes big bucks to pay for specialized but probably poorly designed hardware that is computationally powerful but relatively inefficient, and the whole setup is not efficient enough to allow people to contribute consumer-level computing power even to mining pools.
In the future, advances in hardware and maybe even in the algorithms of Bitcoin itself will *hopefully* make it possible for huge swaths of people to contribute computing power to the network, subsidized only by very low transaction fees, if only to break even and thus just contribute to maintaining the network for their own benefit.

Chips or coitus, it's all the same.
Now, most clients avoid pulling value from unconfirmed transactions; that is, if T1 is not confirmed, then T2 will be formed by referencing some other, confirmed transaction, T3. Of course, if you have limited funds, or you make a whole bunch of quick transactions, then the reservoir of confirmed transactions from which to pull value will be depleted quite quickly, and you'll hit the problem I described.
Until potential fixes for transaction malleability are put into place, modern clients simply force you to wait for your change to be confirmed before it can be used again.


It goes nowhere. It's just a bookkeepng bug on the part of old or poorly written clients. As long as you still possess the private keys necessary to construct the relevant transaction, you can just make a new transaction; in the case of bad software, it's going to be matter of making that software forget about T2.


It's scattered across the net; Bitcoin is, after all, an open-source project.

Fees for transactions have been outrageous for a long time, because clients have set the value to something that doesn't change, regardless of the fluctuating price of BTC, and regardless of whether the network will accept the transaction at a lower fee (depending on how the transaction is formed, you can send a transaction without any fee if you know what you're doing).
Hopefully, there will be more of a free market for fees in the future, with software allowing the users to specify the fee/priority more directly.

Democracy is bollocks.
* All activity in life is about the profitable appropriation of capital.
    Through the threat of violence, democracy gives an equal voice to unequal people, thereby shifting the power of capital appropriation from those who would appropriate capital well to those who would not appropriate capital well.
    Capitalism is the right philosophy for how capital should be appropriated: Capital should be appropriated by voluntary trade, so that in the long run, capital is ultimately appropriated by those who have proven themselves good at appropriating capital.
    Government is involuntary trade.
* Capitalism is, in fact, the best way to collaborate.
    Capitalism is the recognition that nobody in particular knows how capital would be best allocated; it is the recognition that, in the long run, the best decisions will emerge from voluntary trade, perhaps without people even realizing it.
    Competition *is* collaboration; it is how we find a good allocation of capital.
    When you fund a "collaborative commons" project, you are engaging in capitalism; you are choosing to allocate your capital; you are experiencing voluntary trade.

The blockchain is a stable, secure, easily accessed, essentially timestamped log.
For one, you personally cannot store hashes to everything that might be of interest to you at some point in the future; you won't even have thought to make those hashes, such as this case with the Gutenberg library.

Threshold signatures are really the key (pun most definitely intended).
* They allow for authority to be spread about, as with the traditional multisignature approach.
* They don't reveal how many parts the authority is spread across, keeping private how you organize your loot.
* (not sure) No one device ever holds a copy of any complete private key.
* They produce regular non-multisignature transactions, which are small and therefore cheap.

My guess is that to get the masses interested in crypto, it will take something relatively unexpected, something that taps into humanity's more base desires, but is not "heinous" enough for the majority of people to support governmental suppression: **Productive Gambling**.
A *decentralized* prediction market like [Truthcoin]( could be the ticket (it's an open technology that anyone can implement, not an altcoin, per se):
* It allows people to voice an opinion, which has proven to be the killer app of the Internet.
* It allows people to gamble, which has proven to be the killer app of entertainment.
* It provides useful information to society.
* It cannot be shut down.

There's a reason why the moon landing occurred in 1969, and not in 1169; the development of technology is far from random, as all evolutionary paths are far from random.
Nearly every development is inevitable, because there are lots of people playing with the same technologies and ideas of the day; if Satoshi had been killed in a car crash in 2007, then sometime within these 50 years, someone would have developed Bitcoin, which is basically git, a p2p network, and hashcash thrown together, and sprung from ideas that have been on the minds of people for decades. etc. etc. etc.

That's an appeal to authority.
Anyway, Bitcoin is the relatively obvious combination of fundamentally important ideas that had taken root in the years before the whitepaper was published.
* Using merkle trees for creating a distributed database was popularized by *git*, though not even created by git; git is celebrating its 10th anniversary.
* Spam control through proof of work was formulated as Hashcash, which itself became a fundamental cornerstone to Bitcoin, with an extension to allow for dynamic scaling of computing power.
* Emergent, self-sustaining p2p networks composed of seeders and leechers was established by bittorrent.
* Elliptical-curve cryptography was well studied.
* The austrian/libertarian economic principles that define design choices and incentives with regard to how Bitcoin works had been long discussed (over the previous decades if not centuries), including the notion of putting those ideas into practice as a digital currency.
    How Bitcoin transactions work is remarkaly redolent of the ancient [tally stick system](
* Bitcoin uses a stack-based programming language similar to Forth, which is popular for low-level, compact instructions.
* Let's not forget other efforts to make a digital currency.
The fields of study involved are in no way disparate; indeed, Gavin Andresen stumbled across Bitcoin because he had *already* developed an interest in cryptography, peer-to-peer systems, and digital money.
To call it a never-before-conceived combination is just pointless; that makes it an advancement, but not a "great advancement" worthy of the title "genius".
**It was inevitable and imminent.**  
The time was ripe.
Fortunately, all the heavy lifting had been done for Satoshi. [For instance](










If Satoshi hadn't formulated Bitcoin, then it is very likely someone else would have done so around the same time. **It was not required for Satoshi to be a genius; Bitcoin does not imply that Satoshi was a genius.**

Theoretically, it might not tell you with certainty that you've got the real chain, but what about practically?
After 6 confirmations, your transaction could *theoretically* be thrown out when some superior chain gets broadcast, but Satoshi showed us that *practically*, it is a small enough chance that it can be considered no chance at all.
We need numbers.
What if verifying headers all the way back to the beginning of time means you've got the right chain with 99.999999976% probability?

The Bitcoin network is open to anyone to submit a transaction for processing into the blockchain. A double spend is just the appearance of conflicting transactions that have been submitted for processing. Why does this happen? Well, why *not?* Malicious or otherwise, its expected.
Eventually, the Bitcoin network will choose one of the transactions (or possibly none at all); whatever the Bitcoin network confirms as being the true transaction is, by definition, the true transaction; the more confirmations that a transaction receives (that is, the more deeply buried in the blockchain that a transaction becomes), the truer that transaction becomes.

The transaction, T1, that sends value to the prostitute also sends value, C, to the change address. So, C is not confirmed to be in John's control until T1 is confirmed; even though John knows with certainty that C is definitely going to be in his control, the Bitcoin network does not, because the Bitcoin network has not confirmed this yet for itself, and whatever the Bitcoin network thinks is all that matters.
So, John decides to pay for more services before T1 is confirmed (don't forget, it's normal for 1 confirmation to take perhaps 30 minutes); he tries to make another transaction, T2, which pulls value from C by referencing T1, and then he transmits T2 to the Bitcoin network.
Now, everybody used to think this would work; people thought that T1 would be confirmed, and then that would make T2 confirmable, and so then T2 would be confirmed.
However, due to various technical constraints, it's possible to alter T1 without rendering T1 invalid or changing T1's outputs; the altered transaction, T1^', still produces the desired result, but T1^' has a new name.
So, because someone in the Bitcoin network is malicious or is running buggy software or because a high-energy particle from an exploding neutron star flips just the right bits, some miner gets ahold of T1^' and includes it into a valid block before the original T1 can be included in a valid block; that is, T1^' gets confirmed, making the original T1 into a double spend. Now that T1 will never be confirmed, neither will T2.
So, this is what happens: Long after finishing up, the prostitute realizes she got paid for the blow job (that's the T1^' payment) but not for the upgrade to coitus (that's the T2 payment). To make matters worse, John's wallet software is as stupidly written as Bitcoin Core itself used to be, so it still tells John that T2 has been sent and is showing him that his balance has been reduced accordingly. Everyone is confused, and a lot of trouble ensues.

* Anyway, [Charles Herzfeld, ARPA Director](
    &gt; the ARPANET came out of our frustration that there were only a limited number of large, powerful research computers in the country, and that many research investigators, who should have access to them, were geographically separated from them.
* Packet switching, and the concept of a large computer network predated the ARPANET project, though led directly to its development; that government provided funds to the dreamers is irrelevant, because there was a need for their idea, and they probably would have found funding otherwise.
* There are lots of components that go into make a network function. Government shoehorned its quite possibly inferior technology into industry; [regarding TCP/IP](
    * &gt; In March 1982, the US Department of Defense declared TCP/IP as the standard for all military computer networking.
    * &gt; IBM, AT&amp;T and DEC were the first major corporations to adopt TCP/IP, despite having competing internal protocols (SNA, XNS, etc.)... \[other\] protocols included IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), Microsoft's native NetBIOS, and Xerox Network Systems (XNS).
    Regading HTTP, there were other protocols in development, such as [Gopher]( that layer of the web was *inevitable*.
    What about all the other pieces of software that make the Internet actually useful? So what if government laid one of many possible foundations; the real work was done in the higher levels. Indeed, it was non-governmental work that has improved the original protocols to the point where they could function well enough for today's services.

At every turn, you neglect to explain that the Factoid token is necessarily going to be on an alternative blockchain, essentially making it an altcoin.
The connection with Bitcoin is tenuous at best, because it only involves a small transaction fee every 10 minutes, and there's nothing to stop you from copying all those anchors into some other blockchain, like your own, or like ethereums, or whatever future blockchain is the most secure.
Your whole system is based on an unproven consensus algorithm that even the creator of Ethereum called overly complicated.

As more people buy Factoids, it becomes less risky to purchase Factoids; those who take a larger risk by purchasing earlier are rewarded for taking that risk.
* What if nobody purchases any Factoids after 7 days, and the team is left to collect $200,000 after the sale? Those initial buyers will have "invested" in a project that got significantly less funding than desired. The early purchasers took a risk, and have found their "investment" to be quite risky.
* What if by the last week of the sale, $5,000,000 worth of Factoids have been purchased? Then, purchasing Factoids is a matter of "investing" in a project that you know has a large backing already. Those later purchasers waited to see how something progressed before jumping in, and should not be so highly rewarded.

Money is money, whether it comes from the government or not; the government is not magical, and its squandering of resouces is not less painful to society than squandering by some other organization.
* Everybody knows the mantra that "basic" research is fundamental to unforeseen and lucrative advancements, so why would you expect organizations other than government to ignore that fact? They want to achieve unforeseen and lucrative advancements, which is why large corporations spends billions on "basic" research.
* The problem is that you're trying to say that what those corporations do is not "basic" research, but merely incremental innovations on top of the real "basic" research that governments have granted the world. However, what I see in your "basic" research is a lot of money being wasted on developments that could be more cheaply figured out in the future.
    Maybe the Tower of Babel was erected to reach the moon; this was government funding of basic research into how one might go about doing it. After all, no merchant of the day would have spent coin on such a venture. However, I'm sure you'd agree it would be better to wait a millennium or two before throwing the people's money at the problem.
    Basically, your "basic" research is a Pyrrhic victory. It's better to let the merchants innovate over the centuries until they land on the moon for fun on their way to their lucrative mines in the asteroid belt.

    That is, Bitcoin is designed on the assumption that the collection of miners is dominated by general interests (as opposed to a special interest), and that the hashrate is sufficiently high to prevent any special interest from gaining significant authority.

Bitcoin *is* a settlement layer.
It's just that Bitcoin has made settlement, for the first time, reasonably fast enough that people have used its BTC token as a currency.
Yet, from the beginning of Bitcoin, people have complained about buying commodities like Coffee, because ain't nobody got time to sit around for at least 1 confirmation by the Bitcoin network; consequently, attempts have been made to shoehorn "zero-confirmation" transactions into Bitcoin by means of social convention (refusing to relay double spends, etc.), which is completely detached from proof of work, and is therefore fundamentally wrongheaded—it also ruins legitimate usages, like double spending one's own transaction in order to increase the transaction fee.
So, what would happen? Well, what *has* happened in practice: Bitcoin is used as the settlement layer, and all manner of currency layers have been built on top of it; that's why Coinbase and ChangeTip and Circle, etc., are designed the way they are: Other layers that ultimately use Bitcoin for strong settlement via the consolidation of many transactions.
Fortunately, people have been learning that they can devise decentralized currency layers on top of Bitcoin, such as the Lightning Network or that other one just announced.

BIP70 would have Circle read exactly how many bitcoins to send and to which address, but not too long ago at least, sending funds to a QR code meant telling your client (in this case, some Circle app) to send a certain amount of money (usually bitcoins) to the scanned Bitcoin address.
That is, an app (including Circle's) has traditionally required the user to specify exactly how much to send; when that amount must be specified in bitcoins, then the user just copies the exact requested amount, but Circle (to my knowledge) allows for specifying a dollar mount, which would be most natural to "mom".

Hard forks are, in general, an idiot's approach to updating Bitcoin; if you *must* create a hard fork, then you'd better have a damn good reason for doing so, like implementing some more general solution for handling upgrades, a kind of hard fork to end all hard forks.
Hell, both sidechains and the related idea of extension blocks require only a soft fork, and would allow for the beginnings of the Internet of Money to find and congregate around the solutions to problems like the block size without forcing anyone who is skeptical.
This issue is about more than block size. Is Bitcoin about majority rule, or is Bitcoin about the extreme decentralization of power?

* Bitcoin XT appears to have been anounced on [2014&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;28]( but had nothing to do with the blocksize debate. Indeed:
    &gt; A brief note about the goals of this project. The XT project is intended to provide a friendly environment where [SPV] app developers and merchants can experiment with new features and explore new directions for the protocol, if there is demand for that. Those upgrades could then be considered for inclusion into Core at a later date. I do not expect there to be thousands of XT users any time soon, but that's OK. Because the patch set contains features that don't require everyone to opt in (e.g. changes to the tx/block formats), even just a few nodes can be useful.
    Wow! It was so benign that nobody even responded.
* It was only on [2015 May 6]( that Matt Corallo brought the discussion of block sizes to the development mailing list from Gavin's blog:
    &gt; Recently there has been a flurry of posts by Gavin at
 which advocate strongly for increasing
the maximum block size. However, there hasnt been any discussion on this
mailing list in several years as far as I can tell.
    That seems to have begun the debate in earnest. Mike&amp;nbsp;Hearn entered the fray on [2015&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;7]( spouting many of the mantras espoused by the proponents of Bitcoin&amp;nbsp;XT today, and taking everybody off guard by emphasizing the need for swift, dictatorial action.
* Very interesting discussion ensued, including new proposals, variations on proposals, criteria for a hard fork and for what values of block size would be obviously acceptable, etc. Adam Back proposed extension&amp;nbsp;blocks on [2015&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;30]( to allow for a possibly very robust, generalized upgrade system related to sidechains, and which only requires a soft fork.
* Then, on [2015 June 14]( Mike&amp;nbsp;Hearn made the first veiled threat of a hard&amp;nbsp;fork:
    &gt; As nothing that has been proposed so far (Lightning, merge mined chains, extension blocks etc) has much chance of actual deployment any time soon, that leaves raising the block size limit as the only possible path left. Which is why there will soon be a fork that does it.
    [which Adam Back caught](
    &gt;&gt; Which is why there will soon be a fork that does it.
    &gt; I understand why you would be keen to scale bitcoin, everyone here is.
    &gt; But as you seem to be saying that you will do a unilateral hard-fork, and fork the code-base simultaneously, probably a number of people have questions, so I'll start with some...
So, Bitcoin XT only *stifled* discussion, and instead turned it into one giant political debate where people chose teams and dug their heels in for bloody battle. What a massive waste of resources!

Now, you're starting to make particular definitions; there's nothing wrong with the definition you're implying, but that's clearly not how most people think of "backed", as evidenced by this very video's use of The Federal Reserve as kind of backing.
In any case, people make up their backings (as per your definition) for whatever suits their lives.

From the document:










It seems to be using Bitcoin's limited, built-in scripting capabilities to create a kind of hybrid between payment channels and sidechains.
* Two parties agree to make a bunch of microtransactions off-chain, and set up some data structures to help them do that; these data structures are used to maintain what's called the "penny bank", which is basically the final transaction that will be broadcast to the Bitcoin network to settle the microtransactions.
    A penny bank is protected by proof of work: Each party creates a chain of pennies to give to the other; each penny is computed from the data of the previous penny, and computed in such a way that each one represents the proof-of-work calculations required to generate a certain number of satoshis as defined by some formula.
    In this way, a penny more toward the start of the chain allows for calculating very easily a penny more toward the end of the chain, but a penny more toward the end of the chain reveals nothing about a penny more toward the start of the chain; that is, a penny is easy to validate, but hard to calculate by brute-force.
    To send a microtransaction to a party, a penny is revealed to that party, revealing pennies from the end of the chain first and working toward the start of the chain.
    Once both chains are known, it's possible to construct a valid on-chain Bitcoin transaction for the total number of satoshis owned by the penny bank.
* Pennies are exchanged, and the penny bank finalization transaction is kept up-to-date with who owns what, and signed by both parties.
* If all goes completely well, only two on-blockchain transactions are required:
    * One to establish the value controlled by the penny bank; a transaction sends funds that can be unlocked when both penny chains are known and when one party provides a valid signature, or *presumably* when both parties sign a transaction.
    * One to finalize the results of the p2p off-chain transactions; the penny bank transaction is formulated and broadcast to the network.
* If something goes awry, the unfinished penny bank transaction can still be be broadcast, in which case the previously agreed upon exchange is settled, and the remaining pennies' worth is kept locked up, only to be unlocked through further cooperation: Either both parties decide to work together, or one of the parties has to calculate by brute-force the rest of the unknown penny chain.
    In this way, a view of the current state can be kept off-chain, or stored as a snapshot on-chain, creating a kind of private, temporary ledger.
I don't think it quite works, though. As soon as a penny is revealed, it cannot be hidden again, except perhaps by coming up with a new set of pennies. This makes "back and forth" penny exchange not terribly practical, but might work for a one-way channel.
Now, give me coin or karma.

    * Provide a means for transferring the control of BTC to other consensus systems, so that people can try out new approaches and ultimately adopt one explicitly.

In the future, it will be possible to resubmit your transaction with a higher fee, something that many of us have wanted for a long time.
Unfortunately, it's not practical at the moment, because a large number of fools erroneously think that they can provide stronger guarantees for zero-confirmation transactions if they disallow the ability to resubmit (and thus double-spend) a transaction.
As for the purpose of Bitcoin, well, it's most important point is to provide a decentralized network for calculating a consensus about the history of events. The secondary goal is to make that network efficient enough to allow for recording currency transactions cheaply; hopefully, the whole ecosystem can be made efficient enough to handle even microtransations cheaply, but it's clear that this tertiary goal has not yet been reached.

Well, as it turns out, it's probably not possible to have a sufficiently large number of on-chain transactions to fund a hashrate high enough to thwart a determined special interest.
To keep Bitcoin cheap and secure, the transaction volume must increase drastically, but only in that the on-chain fees must add up to a drastically higher number; hence, a transaction consolidation network on top of Bitcoin is the likely solution for success.
To many of us, the correct solution entails a conservative, stable, reliable, infrequently altered core system that provides the foundation for BTC, the token with which a whole bunch of interesting and even proprietary systems can be run and interconnected. That is, this implies sidechains or extension blocks, or the like, and something like the Lightning Network to handle currency usage, and so on.
That's the **Internet of Money**, folks.
After all, it's more important to secure 100 thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee. Go ahead; stick your coffee purchase in the settlement layer (Bitcoin) directly if you want, but you won't want to do so, because that's insane; there is no point in storing that one transaction for all time in a highly secure record.
A real solution is not a piecemeal approach to fixing hard forks as they arise (go read about the accidental fork in 2013), and is certainly not a reliance on triggering hard forks for each and every particular issue (like block sizes), but is rather 2 fold:
* Design a robustly isolated consensus system that runs inside of a very well understood, simplified virtual machine with no third-party dependencies, and a deterministic way to compile the consensus code for that virtual machine.
* Provide a means for transferring the control of BTC to other consensus systems, so that people can try out new approaches and ultimately adopt one explicitly.
    Sidechains or, more intimately, extension blocks are a good start for creating this Internet of Money.
As the block reward diminishes, the only \[acceptable\] way to keep the hashrate high *and* transaction fees cheap is by dramatically increasing the volume of transactions; unfortunately:
* By itself, increasing the block size scales the volume of transactions very *very* poorly.
* Something like the Lightning Network would apparently benefit greatly from at least a slightly larger block.
Thus, I'm partial to a very conservative approach about which one can easily reason, like Adam&amp;nbsp;Back's proposed 4 year plan (2&amp;nbsp;MB "now", then 4&amp;nbsp;MB in 2 years more, then 8&amp;nbsp;MB in 2 years thereafter, and then we re-assess); maybe that will be enough to see whether the Lightning Network can provide the volume necessary to fund a crystalized core; in the meantime, other systems (such as complex voting systems based on game theory and economic incentives and the like) can be devised and tested and possibly put into real action via sidechains, one of which could be grown to become the de&amp;nbsp;facto core.

However, I believe Bitcoin is not yet ready to become [the crystalized core]( that can act as the desired reference point. In particular, keeping the parameters unchanged has one distinct unsolved problem: Sufficient security.
You cannot mandate security; that is, you cannot mandate a hashrate.
* Who is to say that a given hashrate is high enough to actually secure the network from the meddling of a special interest?
* Indeed, what is the *minimum* hashrate required to secure the network? After the next block-reward halving, will the mining industry *still* produce a hashrate that is above that minimum?
* How can you communicate to the users of Bitcoin what this minimum hashrate is? **Who is going to pay for maintaining that minimum hashrate, and how will they pay?**
    [This is where materializes the threat to the 21&amp;nbsp;million BTC limit.](
In short, as the block reward diminishes, the only \[acceptable\] way to keep the hashrate high *and* transaction fees cheap is by dramatically increasing the volume of transactions; unfortunately:

More usefully: Each transacton you form takes as inputs at least one output from at least one previous transaction; this chain of transactions can be followed back to some block reward, which is basically the first valid transaction for said bitcoin value.
So, yes, for some transaction output that you can use as an input to a new transaction, you can calculate its age in terms of blocks and determine the block from which its lineage hails.
EDIT: Naturally, a transaction can merge lineages by taking as inputs multiple outputs. However, that just requires you to define some suitable definition for "age" and "origin"; whatever is useful for your purposes will do.

Digital Gold is doable. However, a Currency network is not so obviously possible with current technology.
Fortunately, a Currency network can be built upon a Digital Gold, but it's going to take more time to work out the details; at the very least, a transaction-consolidation network (TCN) (like the Lightning Network) is necessary—currency is one "app" that can be built on top of Bitcoin.
On a grander scale, think of BTC as a resource; Bitcoin, the network, can provide the foundation for BTC, and it will hopefully be possible to use overlays (Lightning Network) and other blockchains (sidechains) to use that BTC in interesting ways.

Linking up universities' computers was the hot idea of the time, and there were a number of competing networking technologies being developed. Some money from government basically happened to find its way to a few people who came up with an open standard, which happened to be adopted by enough organizations until it gained such a wide network effect as to become the de facto standard.
That some government money was involved at some point along the way is entirely irrelevant; it was an inevitable development.

That's why in the long term, the system needs to be designed such that there is a solid, robust, isolated consensus system called "Bitcoin" that allows for permissionless innovation by making it possible for users to transfer their BTC to other consensus systems (and back again!), and thereby explicitly *choose* a de&amp;nbsp;facto successor in a decentralized, organic, evolutionary manner without the dictation of any "core" group of "experts".
If you think some derivative consensus system is superior (say, one without any sort of limit), then you should be able to transfer your BTC to that consensus system, while frightened fools like myself can just continue our conservative use of the existing system until we see the light.
That is, a real solution is not a piecemeal approach to fixing hard forks as they arise (go read about the accidental fork in 2013), and is certainly not a reliance on triggering hard forks for each and every particular issue (like block sizes), but is rather 2 fold:
* Design a robustly isolated consensus system that runs inside of a very well understood, simplified virtual machine with no third-party dependencies, and a deterministic way to compile the consensus code for that virtual machine.
* Provide a means for transferring the control of BTC to other consensus systems, so that people can try out new approaches and ultimately adopt one explicitly.
    Sidechains or, more intimately, extension blocks are a good start for creating this Internet of Money.
Thus, I'm partial to a very conservative approach about which one can easily reason, like Adam&amp;nbsp;Back's proposed 4 year plan (2&amp;nbsp;MB "now", then 4&amp;nbsp;MB in 2 years more, then 8&amp;nbsp;MB in 2 years thereafter, and then we re-assess); maybe that will be enough to see whether the Lightning Network can provide the volume necessary to fund a crystalized core; in the meantime, other systems (such as complex voting systems based on game theory and economic incentives and the like) can be devised and tested and possibly put into real action via sidechains, one of which could be grown to become the de&amp;nbsp;facto core.

That alone is incorrect. Another distinguishing feature is that it removes monetary policy from centralized organizations such as governments or banks; furthermore, Bitcoin proposes a particular monetary policy that contradicts the views of mainstream policymakers, such as a limited supply.
In the genesis block, Satoshi included a reference to a news article: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"; this was probably intended as proof that the block was created on or after January 3, 2009, as well as a comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking. In a forum post, Satoshi noted that Bitcoin is aligned with the interests of libertarians.
In the whitepaper, Satoshi specifically references the desire to enable "small casual transactions", which he notes are made too expensive by existing systems.
In a forum post, Satoshi suggested it might be a good idea to buy some Bitcoin, because it could be worth a lot one day.
Anyway, your poor understanding of the history of Bitcoin makes no difference; people *now* are trying to make Bitcoin do whatever they find interesting—and they seem to be partial to buying coffee with it, as well as hiding from governments, becoming billionaire early-adopters, and gambling.

How can excellence depend upon coercion?

Look, the government burned TONS of money to construct what is today considered some of the crudest technology, in order to land 2 guys on the moon to plant a flag, make some witty remarks, and pick up a few rocks that remained relatively unexamined for decades; that mission was completely unnecessary for the development of satellite communications technology, which is what is *actually* useful to mankind.
In fact, not only does the development of satellite communications technology lead to the advancements that we've all come to enjoy knowingly or not, but it *pays for itself*, because it is profitable. To build satellite communications, and then use that to build unmanned missions, and then use that to build manned missions, is *clearly* the superior evolutionary path, beause it would PAY FOR ITSELF by virtue of being directly profitable.

Why can't a company just create giant merkle-tree-based hash hierarchies of its own documents and then embed them into the blockchain once a month or once a year or whatever in order to establish a hard snapshot of them?

Even on the advent of Windows&amp;nbsp;10, its ancient and decidedly inferior predecessor has [perhaps around 12% market&amp;nbsp;share](
    Innovation is only workable at the edges of the core system, and the only reasonable path toward bringing that innovation directly into the core system will be to evolve and grow an edge experiment until it seamlessly becomes the de&amp;nbsp;facto core itself without breaking nearly anyone's expectations.
    Therein lies the fundamental political divide:
    * One party thinks majority dictation means consensus, while the other party thinks consensus means there is no such thing as dictation.
    Is Bitcoin about majority rule, or is Bitcoin about the extreme decentralization of power?
    To many of us, the correct solution entails a conservative, stable, reliable, infrequently altered core system that provides the foundation for BTC, the token with which a whole bunch of interesting and even proprietary systems can be run and interconnected. That is, this implies sidechains or extension blocks, or the like, and something like the Lightning Network to handle currency usage, and so on.
    That's the **Internet of Money**.
* &gt; The crux of the matter is who does Bitcoin belong to.
    The premise of Bitcoin is merely that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or catastrophically incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though Bitcoin's design doesn't guarantee it.
    That is, Bitcoin is designed on the assumption that the collection of miners is dominated by general interests (as opposed to a special interest), and that the hashrate is sufficiently high to prevent any special interest from gaining significant authority.
    General interests, typically, aren't too sophisticated, and they become dumber as a mob mentality is fomented.
    If anything, then, Bitcoin is based on the assumption that the original ideas of Bitcoin are pretty darn smart and that a bunch of independent people are too disorganized to collude to change the rules easily.
    This view coincides nicely with the previously outlined Internet of Money.

    A transaction flies across the network as fast as an email; to most people and for most purchases, that's instantaneous.
    Now, confirmation by the network is another issue, but even at around 10 minutes, that's pretty much instantaneous; while each confirmation increases the probability that the transaction is good, zero-confirmation transactions are good enough for everyday purchases, and waiting an hour for a few confirmations is *still* considered "instantaneous" especially for large purchases: Indeed, considering a credit card transaction can be reversed weeks later, an hour most definitely is an improvement for merchants.

* A Tor exit node will be banned by Bitcoin's automatic anti-DoS algorithms, which means regular users will find it difficult to access Bitcoin via Tor.
* An attacker can exploit this fact by banning all good Tor exit nodes, and not banning all its own bad Tor exit nodes; thus, Bitcoin users who connect via Tor will almost always connect through an attacker's node. This allows an attacker to fake the state of the Bitcoin network, thereby allowing the attacker to perform all sorts of attacks, like delaying/dropping blocks and transacions, de-anonymization, finding the entry node, linking bitcoin addresses (all supposedly).
* Bitcoin's ADDR/GETADDR protocol messages allow for fingerprinting users with a kind of cookie by sending users junk IP addresses and reading them back. Woops!
    This is backed by research on actual data; within 10 sessions, they were able to maintain 36% of a fingerprint, and thereby de-anonymize the user; a fingerprint survives restarts, lasts many hours (even more than a day).
* An old attack is to fill up all the good nodes' connection slots, so that new nodes can connect only to an attacker's nodes. A novel attack is to broadcast the IP addresses of legiitimate Bitcoin nodes, but provide fake port numbers, so that any broadcast of those same IP addresses with the real port numbers is rejected because a Bitcoin client, stupidly, only considers the IP address, which it thinks it already knows.
    The point is that you can more easily force people to connect to attacker peers.

@_date: 2015-09-10 20:03:54
What's necessary is twofold:
* Scale the system.
* Keep it decentralized.
Those issues are deeply intertwined, and cannot be considered separately.
Bitcoin must be scaled in order to be self-sustaining; the volume of transactions must grow tremendously in order for Bitcoin usage to be *both cheap and secure*.
However, one data center for processing Visa transactions was handling at&amp;nbsp;least [2500&amp;nbsp;transactions per second]( in the year *2012*; at an average of [600&amp;nbsp;bytes per transaction]( that would require a 900&amp;nbsp;MB&amp;nbsp;block in Bitcoin. [According to Visa]( VisaNet can handle 56&amp;nbsp;000 transactions per second, which would require a 20.160&amp;nbsp;***G***B block, yet don't we want Bitcoin to be *much* more pervasive than Visa?
Upping the block size just does not bring on the kind of scale that we all desire.
So, regardless of your view on how big blocks should be, a consolidation of transactions (e.g., the Lightning Network) is ultimately the only reasonable option for scaling Bitcoin *meaningfully*. It also provides nice benefits, like decreased traceability.
After all, it's more important to secure 100 thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee.

**TL;DR:** *Tether* will use *Factom* to prove its reserves, and *Factom* will use *Tether* to ensure the stability of its crowdsale income.
This article doesn't really spell it out, so I think this is what's going on:
* *Tether* is creating a cryptocurrency that is pegged to the USD, and will use *Factom* to prove it has 100% reserves of the USD backing that cryptocurrency.
* *Factom* is about to undergo [a crowdsale through Koinify]( to fund its work.
    When the *GetGems* project did the same, the USD value of the BTC they received tanked, losing it a significant chunk of its funding; in order to avoid this problem, *Factom* apparently plans to use the BTC it receives to purchase *Tether*'s cryptocurrency, and thereby lock in the USD value of the crowdsale.

In short, I don't yet have a solid opinion.
By definition, truth is only what the Bitcoin network (a third party) says it is; truth is a matter of probability, and the network's confirmation of truth is exponentially compounded with time.
So, given the current Hascash difficulty, etc., one could make a calculation about the truth of an event recorded in the blockchain, but what (beyond validation of inputs or comparison of outputs between transactions) can be said about a transaction that is not yet in the blockchain?
The simplest approach is just to say that nothing can be said about it. Then, one must either wait on confirmations, or provide extra blockchain-based guarantees by, say, locking funds up according to some protocol like that of the Lightning Network.
However, there is a lot more honesty in the world than Bitcoin assumes, and that honesty can be exploited to everyone's benefit; that's why people trust zero-confirmation transactions at all.
Unfortunately, a good model depends on a lot of issues that are not yet standardized or fixed; transaction malleability, whether a recipient reuses addresses, whether chaining of unconfirmed transactions is to be permitted, etc., all factor into the discussion.
At a minimum, it seems silly to rely on the conventions of the Bitcoin network nodes; those conventions could change at any time, or they could be stifling to some legitimate use-case (like resubmitting a stuck transaction with a higher fee). It would probably be best to leave the rules to the discretion of the recipient and sender, and remove rules from the network nodes.

* The fields are in no way disparate; indeed, Gavin Andresen stumbled across Bitcoin because he had *already* developed an interest in cryptography, peer-to-peer systems, and digital money.
* To call it a never-before-conceived combination is just pointless; that makes it an advancement, but not a ["great advancement"]( worthy of the title "genius".
    It was inevitable and imminent.  
    The time was ripe.
    Fortunately, all the heavy lifting had been done for Satoshi. [For instance](
    &gt; Bitcoin uses very little cryptography, Andresen argued. It uses elliptic curve keys, ECDSA signatures, and cryptographic hashes, but that's it. Even the use of the security protocol Open SSL was “kind of naive,” he said. There was no mention of Schnorr or Lamport signatures, which Andresen argued would likely be annotated somewhere in the code even if not used.
    &gt; One quote from Nakamoto convinced Andresen that he, she, or the group, was not a cryptographer:
    &gt;&gt; “Crypto may offer 'key blinding.' I did some research and it was obscure, but there may be something there. 'Group signatures' may be related.”
    &gt; But key blinding and group signatures are concepts from Crypto 101.
    &gt; That's not to say that Bitcoin was any less ingenious. “Satoshi was a brilliant programmer,” Andresen said. “But he didn't have a deep understanding of all the cutting edge crypto research that's going on.”
    It was not required for Satoshi to be a genius; Bitcoin does not imply that Satoshi was a genius.

I didn't say it is.


No, I did not say that; this is another example of why it is important to have a precise understanding of semantics. After all, a bitcoin address is derived from a private key, but there are no \[known\] inherent issues with publishing an address widely.
I said that a public key is derived from a private key, and that a public key is normally published only when submitting a transaction (which, of course, requires acces to the private key), so a public key *is* essentially hidden along with the private key.
I also said that there is, however, a security value in keeping a public key hidden, because flaws in random number generators (and the like) can *and have* allowed for deriving private keys from public keys (when bitcoin addresses are reused). If quantum computers ever become a possibility, there is already an algorithm to derive a private key from a public key fairly quickly through brute force; yet, there is no such algorithm for deriving a private key from a bitcoin address.
PGP is ancient software, and was designed when computing systems were fairly primitive, and before [Shor's quantum algorithm]( was formulated. So, while public key cryptography is theoretically meant to work as you envision, in practice there are potential weaknesses, which Bitcoin sidesteps by not using public keys directly.
Now, give me an upvote, goddamnit.

What are *you* talking about?
Activity is the allocation of capital; that allocation is either profitable or not profitable.
Capitalism is the philosophy that capital should be allocated solely through voluntary agreements; capitalism is the recognition that the best way to allocate capital (that is, the way most likely to be profitable) is decentralized command and control.
A free market solves problems without people even realizing it's happening; it does not depend on an Intelligent Designer.

For most sidechains, especially this one, the exchange rate between BTC and the sidechain token will indeed be deterministically pegged.
However, if no one is actually paying for the maintenance of Bitcoin (the system), then it will cease to exist; you cannot convert your liquidcoin back to BTC if there is no Bitcoin system.
If people did want to resurrect Bitcoin after such a failure (in order to convert the liquidcoin to BTC), then there would be a massive problem with ensuring that the resurrected Bitcoin is suitably secure in the beginning, just as with any other nascent altcoin. It would probably take a centralized effort to get the machine up and running again, and then the training wheels for decentralized operation could be removed.

There's nothing preventing a miner from picking it up.
The real question is whether any miners know about it; it might need to be rebroadcast.
Also, it would be worthwhile to calculate the priority, for which there is a definite formula in the standard mining algorthm; by now, it might be high priority even though it doesn't have a fee, and thus a miner would likely include it.

The threat comes from quantum computing. A Bitcoin address is the hash of a hash of the public key that is derived from a private key; thus, the address does not expose information about the public key that can be used by quantum algorithms to derive private keys.
However, once a transaction is made, the public key must be fully exposed to the network in order to verify the authenticity of the transaction. This opens up the private key to attack by quantum computers.
Anyway, this topic has been covered exhaustively for years.

To be honest, I have no idea what will end up being the much discussed "killer app" that drives Bitcoin adoption To The Moon. However, I can say I am not convinced that interfacing with the legacy system is even necessary.
My guess is that to get the masses interested in Bitcoin, it will take something relatively unexpected, something that taps into humanity's more base desires, but is not "heinous" enough for the majority of people to support governmental suppression: Productive Gambling.
A *decentralized* prediction market like [Augur]( could be the ticket:
* It allows people to voice an opinion, which has been proven to be the killer app of the Internet.
* It allows people to gamble, which has been proven to be the killer app of entertainment.
* It provides useful information to society.
* It cannot be shut down.
Something like that might be compelling enough for people to seek out BTC without involving fiat at all, especially when involving fiat entails draconian KYC/AML impositions.

The thing is, it's quite possible to use Bitcoin without either constant electricity or the Internet:
* Private keys can be exchanged between parties who trust each other; where there is less trust, some more official protocol or representation ("official" notes) could be employed.
* The blockchain is just a large chunk of structured data; even if it's updated only irregularly, it could still provide enough data to prove that a person at least seems to own the coins he's trying to move.
    * If used merely as a means of definite settlement, then all manner of trading (printed keys and transactions, non-Internet device-to-device communication of signed transactions, etc.) could be collected and sent off in bulk to some Internet-connected entity to handle as a service interfacing with the Network.
Anything cash can do, so can Bitcoin; the converse is not true.

**TL;DR:** *Tether* will use *Factom* to prove its reserves, and *Factom* will use *Tether* to ensure the stability of its crowdsale income.
This article doesn't really spell it out, so I think this is what's going on:
* *Tether* is creating a cryptocurrency that is pegged to the USD, and will use *Factom* to prove it has 100% reserves of the USD backing that cryptocurrency.
* *Factom* is about to undergo [a crowdsale through Koinify]( to fund its work.
    When the *GetGems* project did the same, the USD value of the BTC they received tanked, losing it a significant chunk of its funding; in order to avoid this problem, *Factom* apparently plans to use the BTC it receives to purchase *Tether*'s cryptocurrency, and thereby lock in the USD value of the crowdsale.

Right now, every node tries to host a copy of the entire blockchain, which is simple but *probably* unnecessary.
* The data could be distributed more efficiently in order to achieve a certain degree of redundancy; right now, it's like a RAID 1 (mirror) of the blockchain across all nodes, but it could be possible to get away with a more complex scattering of data.
* While it's necessary to have the entire blockchain in order to have a complete, provable picture of reality, most people do not and never will care about having a complete picture.
    After a block is buried, say, 100&amp;nbsp;*thousand* blocks deep, it's pretty much impossible to alter; it's probably not worth it for most nodes to store even older blocks, and can safely assume that it's got a correct view.

* For Bitcoin to work, blocks *must* be produced on a regular basis; the flow must never stop.
* It costs resources to produce a block.
    The incentive for a miner to produce a block is that someone is paying him to do so (specifically, someone is paying him more than it costs to make the block); essentially, no block can be empty, because every block must contain a transaction that pays the miner who creates it.
    Right now, there is no such thing as an empty block, because the system provides the block reward, which is basically a tax paid by everyone who holds BTC—*everyone* who holds BTC, even those who are not sending a transaction; that's how inflation works. Through the block reward, hodlers are paying for the upkeep of their loot.
    If everyone moves over to the Liquid sidechain, then Bitcoin miners will simply produce blocks with no other transaction in it but the block-reward transaction&amp;hellip; and then move their income over to the Liquid sidechain as fast as possible.
* However, the block reward is *supposed* to be diminishing until it vanishes. When the block reward becomes miniscule, who will pay the miners to produce blocks on a regular basis?
    Hopefully, there will be enough (or, more precisely, high enough) transaction fees to cover the costs. Of course, if everyone is transacting in some other system, then that couldn't possibly work.

The great and underappreciated insight of Bitcoin is that validity is a matter of probability.
This insight extends naturally to microtransactions: Bitcoin is designed to handle a wide dynamic range of transactions, from that which can buy a cup of coffee to that which can buy an international corporation, and thus Bitcoin must provide strong guarantees about the probability that a transaction will be honored; in contrast, an abstraction built atop Bitcoin and constrained just to microtransactions need not be so careful.
It seems obvous, then, that the right solution for microtransactions is a [hub-and-spoke payment channels layer](
Ultimately, Bitcoin is necessary only to provide *some* sufficient constraint on the failure of a microtransaction system; it doesn't matter whether every transaction is recorded, as long as anyone at any time can access the value over which he thinks he has control.

* Your bittorrent analogy is good enough.
    A full node maintains a copy of the shared database (which is called the "blockchain") by receiving and further distributing the blocks that compose the longest chain of blocks.
    A full node also stores and relays transactions that have yet to be processed into blocks, dropping transactions that are considered invalid or spam before they go too far.
    Furthermore, a full node can *optionally* work as a miner, trying to process the transactions that it has received into a new block; in the good ol' days, a user's own consumer computer was enough to perform this task alone, but these days mining requires sophisticated hardware and deliberate cooperation.
    From all of this decentralized activity emerges the Bitcoin network.
* Currently, the only way to ensure income as a full node is to be a miner, because a miner who finds a valid block and gets it into the block chain receives a reward; a normal person can be part of a mining "pool", which shares mining income among its members (i.e., among its top performing members).
    Most people run a full node either out of charity, or because it's valuable to them to have complete, trusted copies of the blockchain.

If a god always existed, then why not do as Carl Sagan suggested: Save a step and just say that the Universe always existed.
Indeed, there are mathematical models in physics that allow for a multiverse in which our universe is just one possible variation; just as man arose from variation and selection from the simple rules of our universe, our universe itself could have arisen from variation and selection within the simple rules of the multiverse.

It's uncertain whether that's going to be the case. The safety required for making very large transfers of value (buying a house) is much greater than the safety required for making very small transfers of value (buying a coffee); a more centralized, more lenient, less computationally intensive system might work better for everyday transactions.
Fortunately, it's possible to build those more limited systems on top of Bitcoin, using pure Bitcoin as a means to make very secure settlements only at regular intervals.

Funds aren't sent to a public key; for one, a bitcoin address is not a public key. Neither does a private key send anything anywhere.
The Bitcoin network processes transactions; to own BTC is to be able to construct a valid transaction referencing at least one other existing valid transaction. Each transaction specifies how its outputs may be used to construct a new valid transaction, and this specification is written in a kind of programming language that is understood by each node in the Bitcoin network; that is, how BTC may be spent is something that can be programmed.
Right now, the most common way to program how BTC may be spent is to say that a certain cryptographic private key must be used to digitally sign a message giving the OK for a new transaction to be made.
However, there are other ways to program how BTC may be spent; if Bitcoin's programming language is ever made sufficiently expressive, it would be quite easy to specify such whitelists.
That being said, a whitelist in this scenario is kind of silly, because it amounts to requiring multiple signatures, which is more directly handled already.

You're missing the point.
The Fed is afraid that the economy won't grow unless banks lend money, and they cannot lend money if they've lost it all in bad investments. So, the Fed has given them tons of money, as you've pointed out.
Unfortunately, the banks are still not lending it out at the rate that the Fed would like, because the banks realize that they're pretty incompetent at appropriating capital; so, the Fed gives them more money, but they still won't lend.
There hasn't been growth, because the banks won't lend, and there hasn't been inflation because the banks won't lend. The result is the stagnation that we currently see, and when bankers decide to try for a better return by opening the floodgates, that's when inflation will hit.
Of course, the Fed will try to stop the flood by raising interest rates, but guess what? There are whole industries that have grown up around the assumption that loans will be cheap; this will cause those industries to fold. Then the government will step in to save them, giving them tax breaks and subsidies. This will require raising taxes and printing more money.
The whole thing is a whack-a-mole for debt. Eventually, *somebody is going to have to pay!*

Let's say Satoshi's coins remain undisturbed for the next 3 decades, and during that time a large Bitcoin economy develops; well, in that case, such an economy will have pretty much emerged around the belief that those coins will never move, and this fact will be priced into the value of a bitcoin. 
Any rapid, large-scale use of Satoshi's bitcoins would therefore take advantage of that mistaken assumption, resulting in a transfer of purchasing power from the economy to Satoshi in a manner that is akin to Satoshi having printed money.

It should be noted that reusing an address theoretically exposes the associated private key to being computed by an attacker due to the complete public key having been exposed, and that privacy concerns involve not just the individual who controls that address, but also everyone who has received a payment associated with that address.
Hopefully, something like [Stealth Addresses]( will become more practical in the future, thereby allowing a user to present a static payment address that does not compromise privacy.
Also, make sure you read about "change addresses". While it's hoped that such details will be hidden from users in the future, they are currently an implementation detail that cannot be fully escaped.

Monopolies are generally regarded as being a bad thing; why would anyone support a monopoly on regulation?

What's stunning is that we're seeing Bitcoin become the TCP/IP of financial transactions.
Competition is being moved to the edges:
* A customer can choose the autoconverting wallet system that he likes best.
* A merchant can choose the autoconverting payment processor that he likes best.
Thus, there will be competition that will improve interfaces until they are seamless, and drive down costs until conversion rates are nearly free. This has 2 outcomes:
* The exising fiat currencies can be used more efficiently, without anyone knowing that Bitcoin is the reason why; it will become second-nature to transmit any sort of money the way that Bitcoin is handled, and people will become receptive to using Bitcoin directly.
* Meanwhile, without disturbing the use of the BTC as a shortly held *currency*, BTC's value will increase to reflect its importance in the world, allowing for people to become comfortable using BTC as a store of value.
In this way, BTC will become *money* without people even realizing it.

* &gt; 1.) But what of the "Satoshi fortune"?
    The distribution of the power to allocate capital is always something worth worrying about. However, it is through *voluntary trade* that Satoshi will have gained his power to allocate a potentially considerable amount of capital; contrast that with monopolies and governments and oligopolies, which tend to accumulate their power of capital allocation through involuntary trade.
* &gt; 2.) miners are actually the trusted third party in this arrangement
    Mastercard is a payment network, and Bitcoin is a payment network; the difference is that Mastercard is controlled by one "miner", while Bitcoin is controlled by the computational consensus of a group of miners composed of anyone who participates as a miner.
    So, yes, the Bitcoin network is a third party—you own whatever the Bitcoin network says you own, and you get to use Bitcoin if the network says you can.
    It's just the same as with Mastercard, except that it's a lot harder for a special interest to put pressure on a network composed of anyone who wants to participate, which brings us nicely to...
     &gt; miners centralizing in China
    If Bitcoin ever becomes an important economic phenomenon, then do you think that the United States is going to let China set policy by controlling the mining process? Do you think Russia is going to let China and the United State dictate policy? Do you think the European Union is going to sit between world powers yet again as they duke it out for supremacy? Do you think Africa will have clawed its way into self-determination just to let the old powers lord it over them yet again? Do you think corporations are just going to let governments alone control the money?
    *Fuck no!*
    Bitcoin will always be *sufficiently* decentralized, because humans hate each other far too much.
* &gt; 3.) Isn't this just like our "free" market that currently exists, where Comcast is "free" to fuck us over so considerably?
    That market is in no way free; it has been dominated by the involuntary trade imposed by governments for many decades.
* &gt; 4.) \[What about a Denial of Service attack?\]
    Those are questions with which every network has needed to grapple; Mastercard protects itself by constructing a very private, proprietary network, but Bitcoin protects itself similarly to how other publicly visible services protect themselves: Spam rules that will need to change over time to accomodate new modes of attack.
    While Mastercard presents a centralized point of failure, Bitcoin enjoys the virtue of a decentralized network: Damage is naturally routed around.
* &gt; 5.) Can Bitcoin coexist along side future developments in quantum computing?
    Consider that a Bitcoin address is a hash of a hash of a public key; one of the reasons for this indirection is precisely because it thwarts the ability to use a quantum computer to derive a private key from a public key.
    If the underlying cryptography does get terribly broken somehow, don't forget that thousands of nodes will have a record of who owns what, allowing an improved network to be bootstrapped to some snapshot of the broken one.

[I will repeat myself](
* The argument is simply over how to identify when an agreement is not voluntary. **A true voluntaryist is deeply afraid of being disagreeable**, and thus seeks to make the rules of his life as explicit as possible, which results in a network of interlocking contracts.

Consider that when you buy a Van Gogh painting, you expect to receive an official certificate of authenticity, which includes the seals and signatures of respected institutions and experts; without this certificate, the veracity of the painting is suspect, and a new buyer would probably require a new one to be created through a very expensive appraisal process.
Now, rather than a piece of paper that could be faked by a skilled fraudster, the certificate could be represented by some blockchain-based token; when you buy the painting, you also request that the token of authenticity be transmitted to you, in the same was that a bitcoin might be transmitted to you; whoever controls that token controls an almost irrefutable claim to being the rightful owner of said painting, and the sequence of ownership speaks to the authenticity of the painting.

You are constructing a straw man, because I am not suggesting that societal evolution be brainless.  Humans have brains that are much more sophisticated than those of other animals, and those brains are part of the *continuing* evolution; human society has already begun to evolve beyond that kind of base struggle for existence.
Unfortunately, those brains are predisposed to look for a leader, the result of which is to stifle decentralized trial and error; more to your point, though, the result is to shape society through the guidance of only a handful of brains, and so it's no wonder that society is still largely built on principles of rape; only this time, people's wallets are being raped, and political competitors are being harmed.

The same reason people keep bars of gold in home vaults instead of cash in a Cyprus bank.
Bitcoin was designed for a world in which there is zero trust; something like the Liquid sidechain benefits from recognizing that the world is, in&amp;nbsp;fact, somewhat trustworthy, and that there is profit to be made by tapping into that trust.
For instance, most Bitcoin users already tap into that trust by placing much of their resources (BTC, fiat, etc.) into the hands of a centralized exchange (if only temporarily). Different risk profiles allow for different choices: Someone who trusts an exchange a&amp;nbsp;lot can just enjoy the convenience of leaving his BTC in its control; someone who trusts an exchange very little can just enjoy complete control over his own BTC.
This Liquid sidechain is centralized in the sense that participant nodes are vetted and approved, but distributed in the sense that each node has no more authority than any other node; trust is spread across the entire consortium, which will probably be composed of participants in many different geographic and legal zones.
Complex systems only work well when there are various tiers for various use cases. As long as its possible to escape to the cold, hardened, trustlessness of pure Bitcoin, then these other, simpler systems can be used for profiting from a finer grained risk profile.

    The Free Market is about evolution, a concept that a lot of people seem to find very difficult to understand; it's a lot easier for people to make sense of a supreme overlord.
    However, knowing the power of decentralized command and control, the more educated among us should push for finding ways that eliminate centralized command and control.
* &gt;  Regulation was needed to stop it because the free market did not force the companies to regulate.
    You are begging the question. Just because the government moves faster does not mean that the government is the right solution.
* &gt; Or how about when gasoline companies were putting lead in gasoline?
    * Begging the question, again.
    * Tragedy of the Commons. The prolem was that regulation was not sufficiently decentralized through private property rights.
    * The government already showed that it was the point of failure, because it commandeered regulatory authority and therefore bore responsibility for ignoring science and setting the bar so lo for so long.
    * Because the government is a centralized authority, it made it easy for wealthy companies to purchase that authority for their own benefit.
    &gt; it may have led to the extinction of the human species.
    I can see it now, people gasping for air through plumes of lead-infused smog, unable to improve their situation for lack of bureaucratic leadership.
* &gt; Maybe we can have approved regulation agencies, but then their own profits are tied to the satisfaction of the companies they're regulating
    That doesn't make any sense. Their profits must be tied to the satisfaction of those wishing for regulation.
    Basically, you're complaining that there will be lobbyists... just like there are already lobbyists... However, the difference is that lobbyists today only have to lobby a centralized organization, whereas in the market place, they might have to lobby a number of separate and *competing* organizations, and those organizations do not get to decree their income without regard to their performance.

Invesment is difficult precisely because it's unknown whether an investment will ultimately be a waste of resources. However, if that investment is objectively profitable, then that investment will have grown the wealth of society, such that in retrospect, it was not a waste of resources at all.
Imagine a world in which Bitcoin does take over, displacing expensive humans in huge swaths of the trust-based sectors of society; in this outcome, society will have realized that it was in fact the traditional system that was extremely wasteful, because Bitcoin not only reclaimed the wealth spent on running that system, but actually freed up even more wealth to be allocated to any number of other endeavors.
That is, wastefulness can only be determined in retrospect. The longer an experiment is self-sustaining (in particular, without coercing allocation of resources to it), the more likely that experiment is better aligned with objective reality.
The best way to run such experiments is through decentralized trial and error, allowing society to evolve by variation and selection. Capitalism is best for achieving this result.

That just makes no sense on a number of levels.
The profitable activity in the Bitcoin "sector" is amplifying the investment that people make when they buy bitcoin, just like the profitable activity by a company is amplifying the investment people make in that company. Buying bitcoin puts capital into the sector, the sector allocates capital in various ways, and the profitable allocations ultimately make BTC more valuable.
There's no way for this amplification to be independent of the underlying units of value; being profitable means that society finds your activity valuable; holding bitcoin means that you are putting capital into certain activity.
Put another way, there's ultimately no real reason why a share in a company couldn't be represented in the same way as a bitcoin. Why is it that I cannot sell 1/2 a share of Apple, or 1/10000 a share, etc? The reasons have been hithertoo technical, not philosophical.

I don't understand attempt at making a distinction between monetary value and other kinds of value. Indeed, if the language that is currency is being used to express the value of these things, then by definition, these things have a monetary value.
Perhaps there is a cultural fear of reifying something like, say, friendship; however, it doesn't stop the fact that, say, a friendship apparently is a matter of material value.

Mining is much cheaper and more secure than the way transactions are handled today with the USD. Moreover, a Fedcoin would give the government unparallelled control over currency.
The Federal Reserve's job is to set policy, not run a payment network; hence, it would pay people to mine according to an open protocol, and thereby let other people innovate the payment network.

The problem with this scheme is that your attackers might not believe that 1 BTC is all you have, and thus proceed to torture you.
If you were indeed lying, at least you can give them something else in the hope that they'll stop torturing you. However, if you were not lying, then you'll probably endure the worst sort of torture for no reason.
Because of this, some have argued that it's best not to obfuscate your setup; plausible deniability is a double-edged sword.

That's a matter of risk management, for which there is an industry known as "insurance", which could be employed to good effect without anyone really realizing it.
An small-time investor wants to know that he is protected from being abused in that way, so he might only purchase shares in a company that has been certified by a regulatory agency which is under contract to pay shareholders damages if such insider trading occurs; then, of course, to protect its own bottom line, that certification agency would take steps to ensure that such insider trading does not occur, including establishing contracts that would place the company and its individual employees under direct liability.
Why go through this decentralized approach when one quick law from a centralized government would do? Because decentralization is conducive to finding the best solutions.

The vast majority of help for the poor comes from charities that existed long before the state stepped in.
Furthermore, it's only been in recent years that society has become wealthy enough to take care of the poor in any meaningful capacity; indeed, the poor people of our times are much better off than well-to-do people in the past.
More to the point: **You are not comprehending the problem:** The State has declared itself the authority in handling the poor; the State fines people for feeding and otherwise helping the poor outside of its own system; most importantly, people don't think of solutions, because helping the poor has been commandeered as solely the domain of the State—**why should I contribute anything, when the State already takes my money for their programs?**

**Sidechains are *NOT* on top of Bitcoin.**
There is no such thing as a "main" chain; there is no such thing as a "side" chain. Fundamentally, there is no distinction.
What the *"Side"chains Proposal* seeks to do is update the Bitcoin protocol so that various blockchain tokens can be pegged to each other; that is, so that a user could move value seamlessly between systems.
* The positive consequence is what is being trumpeted: It will be possible to experiment on a "side"chain.
* The negative consequence is not being talked about: It will be possible for a "side"chain to become so popular that it becomes the "main"chain; miners might jump from supporting Bitcoin to supporting that "side"chain.
