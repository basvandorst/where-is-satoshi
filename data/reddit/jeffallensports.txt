Wrong answer (libtard) - capitalism for the win.

A handful of people own a big % of all currencies...also don't let the currency aspect of it overload your brain, it's also a protocol/technology...both have value.

typical libtard answer...do it for free, GREAT!

Good as in tell us what every other paper/t.v. show in mainstream media said...right "good" - they basically toed the company line and got put to sleep by the general public that saw through it.

He's straight up an establishment hack. He pretends to be trendy and liberal, but he's all about the established order. He sucks.

No, I'm going to state the very obvious truth...and still donate. I'm not donating to Andreas' broke ass, it's to my boy Satoshi...
@_date: 2014-04-23 03:29:59
Andreas the attention seeker at it again. Front in center in the video, awkward as all get up. Not sure anymore if he's in it for bitcoin or for himself. Great job "Andreas" delivering other people's coins.

Haaa, there aren't many of us that have gotten into bitcoins that aren't at least semi-obsessed with it. It's new, it's a game changer, and it's potentially very profitable. Hard to believe us newbies could one day still be considered early adopters. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 22:37:38
Bitcoins para todo!
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:41:41
Just another establishment fellow telling you how to live your life. There is 0.0% negative commentary in the old testament/tora that states that you can't adopt new technology. Also the gold jew, Jesus, threw the money changers out of right...be a man, don't let other men tell you what to do. Stand up for yourself, for your synagogue, for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:02:06
"took it of ahead!"  please explain...
@_date: 2014-02-01 05:39:01
Doesn't bode well for us from a productivity standpoint (how far can he really reach with no savings or capital to back up his positive stance of bitcoin) or make the community look good, the fact that the "leader" and arguably most visible member of the community is stone broke and in debt. Insane you didn't gather some bitgold in 2011 when you started Andreas (obv). Reminds me of the idealists that go work for non-profits and after a couple of years have no capital/nothing to show for it and no ability to help others in the future (which was their original intent). Curious what Andreas' thoughts on other coins such as peer and doge are? Hope you get out of the hole and start SAVING...for the future.

Please, please, please...spell check your site's work. It's very likely that it was written by someone that isn't English first language but with spell check so readily (redditly) available there's no excuse, very unprofessional/embarrassing/not even close.

I'm sure "Nikhil" will get right on it...RIGGGGGHT. Gotta love the naive optimism though, we need more of you in this world.

It's like the Cleveland Cavaliers having a losing team every year and your friend being worried about investing in an NBA franchise...duh!

How can you "self trade" what do u mean, thanks...
I've heard people mention there were no fees so just a bunch of training but curious what that means.

Leave it in there...nothing wrong with it. Nice site, best of luck.

LOL upgrading you music equipment. Don't sell. Buy a $50 guitar on craigslist and be a happy libtard. At least you'll have a future...

Could they come up with a worse name? Is that possible?? Serious question.
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:45:46
NewsWEAK lied for decades, so much that their paper become irrelevant. Another establishment hack rag down the drain. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:12:11
Which will translate into less supply and higher prices on the margin...for those that can afford to mine.

I've almost never gotten it to work properly. I use Authy instead now.
@_date: 2014-01-11 19:59:55
Did you not notice it was with the word "dream" and had a unicorn on it...not so subtly trying to undermine the notion.
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:59:13
Sell when it drops....solid decision.
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:32:02
I'd be so happy to never here "Mount" and "Gox" ever spoken again...good game!!!
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:14:30
Schiff literally can't stop talking about the "value" or what it's "worth" - he just doesn't get it.
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:15:47
Claaaaaasic. You done got Gox'd. You sure that email wasn't from the Onion?
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:20:40
Are you even seriouis? Two rounds?....it went up 70x last year and is up from 410 to $665 now...that's 50% in 2 weeks. 100 points...YES.

Once I saw he was one of the "greatest generation" chaps...I knew right away he would be semi-clueless and there would be almost no relevant info in the article. 
"It's not easy to find out just what bitcoins are, the basis for their worth and what sustains them, other than ether and faith."
"One thing for sure, if you don't understand it completely, better leave it alone."
SERIOUSLY WTF???
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:18:58
It's far from irrelevant. This was a long time coming. Anyone on reddit watching this Gox story unravel shouldn't be surprised. The Horror!
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:44:10
100% bitcoin. Bit is down, Gold is up. Gold has maybe 20% upside while Bit has a massive upside...besides if you're asking this question you're young enough to take risk.
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:01:23
The stock is up nearly 5% today and very likely could continue to rise due to the news of RTBTC getting acquired.
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:15:05
Thanks for stating the obvious there champion.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:54:25
I give the baseball card example: it's worth what someone will pay/trade for it. Is a Ken Griffey Jr. rookie "intrinsically" worth more than a Brandon Belt rookie? No. Is it worth more? Yes.
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:02:42
Lol,...and you're serious, that's the best part.
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:13:24
Leave it to Mr. Nanny State's magazine to use a unicorn on the front alongside bicoin, not cooooool.

I'm embarrassed for you...

He's right: decentralized doesn't mean decentralized.

Here's another trading platform for the bitcoin-ecosystem...I posted this in another thread: 
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:51:08
Nice post. I'm embarrassed for you. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:43:27
It always was amateur hour when "journalists" or clueless people quoted Mt Gox as the "price of bitcoin"...let's see how this plays out, looking ugly for many holding onto coins, great for those looking to purchase on the slide. This will virtually eliminate profits on all mining???
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:41:03
Wow an entire $1,000!! Seriously, but 1.5 coins and hold them...profit.
@_date: 2014-01-12 02:59:55
I hope so, but if not it's going to seriously affect the price. The amount of volume coming out of there is insane! 
@_date: 2014-03-05 06:09:34
Have you not heard of COINBASE.COM???? "fog" LOLOLOLOLLOLOL good luck with all of that...

Andreas = the biggest opportunist, attention whore of the bitcoin community. I never thought the Steve Jobs of bitcoin would have the first name Andreas (shaking head). On that note, I'm donating...
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:45:13
Buy in again at $620 and cost-average your BTC down to around $700...

It's hipster enough b/c doge is cooooool so obviously Apple allows it. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:56:50
Gold will go up slowly, not like you're saying - that's my opinion. Also, gold is outdated in the sense that Iphones and other high technology need other metals like platinum...very little gold. Also pharaohs aren't building gold caskets and the Vatican already has $130 million in gold plating in one of their temples, afterall they're there to help the poor, wink. Seriously, gold is for steady slow growth, btc has the potential to turn $10k into $1 million.
