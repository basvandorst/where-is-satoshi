Its not, but Bitcoin Cash has lower fees, a willingness to adopt new features, and the name Bitcoin. It will be a much easier transition for the public than XRB.
Edit: If Bitcoin doesnt adopt these proven methods, they will be overtaken by Bitcoin Cash, but I do not think another coin is likely to overtake Bitcoin Cash.

Correct me if Im wrong, but Coinbase, GDAX, and maybe others are FDIC insured, so keeping your coin there is essentially as dangerous as BofA.

I dont know enough about the tech, and the personal blockchains seem a little sketchy to me, but I would like to see it more in practice to see if it does work. Other than that, I agree completely.

I dont like Ripple its too centralized and favors corporations, might as well stick with VISA. Raiblocks, Im just a little uncertain of the independent ledgers, it seems to easy to modify or destroy. Can someone explain how everyone maintaining their own ledger is a good thing? That seems to me like it would encourage money laundering and fraud.

I dont think XRB will take over. Bitcoin has grown so much media attention, and XRB isnt advertising, it would be too much of a transition for those who dont follow crypto news.

So you are saying there was a larger decrease and it survived?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:28:51
I hardly know anything about XRB, but from my understanding it has pretty good protocols (its similar to IOTA), but has little attention. Bitcoin Cash also has pretty good practices. I believe if any coin overtakes BTC, its going to be Bitcoin Cash. LiteCoin and Bitcoin Cash are pretty much the same thing, except Bitcoin Cash has greater advertising efforts and shares the name Bitcoin. The majority of the public equates cryptocurrencies with Bitcoin. If Bitcoin Cash wins the spotlight most people wont notice, if LiteCoin starts to take the spotlight a lot of people will be confused and probably resist it, same with any other coin. My bet is that BTC will either adopt the practices of better coins, or it will fall to BCH.

Banks have fees up the ass for random things, they own your money, and it takes a week for a transaction to go through. Cryptos, when done right, will put your money in your own hands and transact instantly at low or no cost. We have not yet perfected the tech, so right now its not very good competition, but it has potential.

Although those are policies of the banks, I think those problems are also pretty much unique to banks. I dont think leaving your private key just laying around will be anywhere near as common as credit cards. I think the problems about reversing transactions are fair points, but they are problems with the blockchain and currencies themselves and not how they are stored.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:19:54
Which is why I said when done right

Are they though? From my understanding its like credit, you are seeing and spending money that you dont exactly have yet.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:55:02
Not necessarily, especially since it went 19k to 11k to 15k to 13k. Its just extremely volatile due to uncertainty of its future. I do believe it is preparing for a crash though because of the news with BCH. It does not seem likely, but if BTC devs announce changes, it will return to 19k+.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:09:29
I would bet they would see those fees, and just assume thats how all cryptos are and just discredit the rest. Its unfortunate for cryptos, but USD and EUR work pretty well, so the common public probably arent going to care enough to do research. I think you have an overly optimistic view of how much the public cares about crypto, but I also hope you are right.
Edit: Most people simply equate cryptocurrency with Bitcoin. They buy into Bitcoin because the media tells them its a great investment, and they dont do any research. Im hoping you are right, and the media further educates enough people, but I dont think thats realistic.

Why is that? Centralized wallets are essentially banks, and the only difference between decentralized wallets and banks is that decentralized wallets are cheaper, safer, and more secure (as long as you can remember your seed), but they dont let you choose your own password or have forgotten password recovery. You dont need to do your own banking, all you need to do is remember your seed. People dont generally forget their SSN, if its important they will remember, and if not, Im sure we can come up with a service to personally connect you to your seed.

I dont want to spend bitcoin because the price is rising so fast. I may spend $50 now on a product and lose a couple hundred in future profits. Once Bitcoin stablizes, I dont see why I wouldnt use it though.

Can I just go on a brief rant right now? 
This is why people have no idea what companies are doing with their data, or how they are being tracked. I'm sure some larger companies may spell it out in the thick textbooks that are their ToS, but most dont and nobody has time to read them anyway. These permission requests need to be broken down into much further detail. I have no problem with giving permission to allow sceenshots to be saved to my device, but allowing complete access to my photos and media seems sketchy. It is too vague, and provides too much access to the developer who I am just trusting to not misuse those privileges. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure you are a trustworthy dev, but I just don't see why something as innocent as saving a screenshot needs to have so much access to my personal information. Hell, at least split the permission request into read and write privileges. These permission requests are the best way for the user to understand what information is being used and how it is being used. Therefor, the requests need to be more exclusive, and they need to include a "more info" button that at least takes you to dev notes. It can't be too hard to implement and it will make so much of a difference. 
I have never written an app where I needed permissions, so I dont fully understand how permission requests are handled. I just think there are a lot of people freaking out right now with the Facebook news, and for good reason. Most are simply uninformed, but even those who try to be informed cannot be. Everything is too hidden, and it is usually by design. Permission requests are directly in front of the user when they are installing, usually in a bulleted style for quick and to the point delivery, but they are always too vague. The user has no idea what information is being used or how unless the dev is nice enough to share his secrets, which we are then just supposed to take their word for it. Fixing these requests is the first and biggest step to improving data privacy and security.
Sorry, just had to get that off my chest.
