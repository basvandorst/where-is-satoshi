I noticed after I started buy BTC with my chase account, money would always be held for a few days longer or checks would take a little longer to clear. I can't say it's directly related but from the stories I've heard, I wouldn't be surprised.

Check it out then! We're pretty helpful and there's a whole wiki of information made by a user from the subreddit. (In the sidebar). And have fun with buying silver!

I only bought 3 oz at $43 dollars... Nearly everything else I have has been bought in the $18-$24 dollar range... Hold onto it, friend.. Don't sell unless you have to.

Join us on if you're interested in silver. I think there are quite a few of us interested in BTC too. Also check out People sell silver and gold there and many will take BTC. Certain users have trusted seller flair and are well known in the community so if you stick with them, you'll be good!!

Definitely use Amagi. I ordered on a Friday night using BTC, and they were delivered on Wednesday! Usually PM companies take much much longer!

Yeah, except you can also buy what is known as "fractional silver".. Silver comes in many different forms, varying in weight from 1 grain to 1000 oz and more..

Never said they were. Its simply a small part of my portfolio.

I just bought my first .13 btc yesterday when it was at $1000. Very strange to see it at $800 in just a few hours... I will be holding and hopefully buying much more.
