What alternatives are there instead of having them on your phone?

Damnit I moved

If you look at this you can make it go backwards like he's falling towards the ground
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:29:59
Yeah but this is because in places like these (top picture) they are investing massive amounts of money, the kid below (you) might be investing 200 bucks every couple weeks, it's not scary to see a drop.

What lol why is the IRS sniffing around Bitcoin for?
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:16:36
TIL I am the 24%
@_date: 2019-07-16 01:25:13
Right? One of many things that peak my curiosity about this whole crypto currency.
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:29:07
Great but like the comic strip above, 90% of consumers are not going to be happy having to understand how much .00044% is to a dollar, how is Bitcoin going to "simplify" things for New comers if this over takes current currency.

So Bitcoin will always be in a flux or swinging rapidly up and down?
@_date: 2019-07-21 23:09:14
178 million? I doubt it will make it to 1.78 million

Life time holder? I aim to keep investing but I feel like in the next couple years investing is not going to turn a profit as much as it could now.
@_date: 2019-07-31 01:37:52
Another problem that arises in my mind now is I hear a lot of talk about this being the future global currency, maybe the only one, but what about people who do not have cell phones? Are they alienated from having currency?

How is this on related to bitcoins? It's in the title and description??
@_date: 2019-07-22 01:15:39
Oh my bad I was saying how 1 Bitcoin won't make it that high. Brain fart my bad
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:37:02
I know I am what are you incinuating I am a squirrel who knows how to use computers? That would be illogical, I will not have you attempt to disgrace my identity as a human and further this conversation to condemn squirrel like behaviors.

Why time travel to invest in Bitcoin when you could easily make way higher stacks on so etching like Microsoft?
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:33:15
This hardly simplifies things, currently 100 dollars usd is equal to 1,040,478  Satoshi, if I am a waitress and your bill is 45.37 usd it's going to be a pain to calculate that unless I have a calculator on hand. Please do not assume that everyone is good at math, this is America after all lol. But seriously.
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:35:06
This is a bad way to go about promoting Bitcoin. Really bad.
@_date: 2019-07-21 23:17:18
Yes that is math, how does dividing it have anything to do with it?
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:24:03
That's great thank you. But it just brings me to a wiki page giving me information (useful!) but I was wanting to know maybe where I can get one, and maybe what is the most popular one, or even what ones do you guys use? Thanks
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:36:59
Found the guy this pack describes I think.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:31:43
I mean it can go to zero that's the thing.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:04:29
I am new I'm sorry what is fiat?
