Hey, sorry for the late response! In most cases, you can make altcoin addresses by adjusting the version byte.
For example, Namecoin's version byte seems to be 0x34 instead of Bitcoin's 0x00. Additionally, Bitcoin P2SH addresses use 0x05.

Blocks are found at random according to a Poisson distribution. The average rate per block is adjusted to be ten minutes according to an algorithm that updates the difficulty of finding a block as the network strength changes. For more information,

They were stuck (again) for a while at block height 323127.
 (Disclaimer: I made this one)

I expected this.

Well... That was an unintentional coincidence.
Back to the drawing board.

We've been doing this in Milwaukee, also.

You got me there.

I might be willing to help. What kind of articles are you looking for?

Sorry, it looks like the transactions are all relatively recent. My outputs index database is still being built, and my little VPS is slowly chugging away at the task. I'm up-to-date for around block 200,000.
Thinking about building my own server, but money. :(
It's open source and ready for pull requests, though:

Plain Bitcoin transactions vs. credit card transactions is not a fair comparison. You should be comparing plain Bitcoin transactions to plain cash transactions, in which case both are irreversible but Bitcoin is more convenience.
If you want to compare Bitcoin transactions with credit card transactions, you need to consider that these extra-layer payment processing features such as chargebacks can be added for Bitcoin just like they have been added for cash. Eventually we will have the VISAs and MasterCards of Bitcoin that use multisignature transactions to enable consumer protection.

I'm planning to implement stealth addresses in MyWallet, but the wallet is far from finished. Message me if you would like to help by providing feedback and suggestions.

Woo! :)
I think this is *possible* already with Darkwallet and some other multisignature wallets. The problem is how easy it is to do, and I'm hoping I can make it very simple.
Edit: If you'd like to know what my long-term ideas for multisignature are, check this out:

This doesn't seem like something that should be tied to a single wallet application. I'll consider it, though. Thank you.

Sorry, I did that.
It was my first commit, and it looked like something easy to add. The main developers talked it over and I believe *this* will be the last checkpoint, then they're moving on to a different system.

Hey again!
Thanks for the feedback on the logo. A new one is now up, thanks to [gjeric](

I'm planning to start with a web app, then port it to Android, (iOS?), and desktop.
Ease of use is, of course, a top priority.

That's not at all what I said.
