Thank you! well, the inside is my secret, but of course it would contain some sort of key. The key is just an example from the wiki, nothing to black out. I crafted it completely with open source software, and I engaged "Eisbärchen-Art" on facebook for the exclusive drawing (thanks so far!). I'm not selling these paperwallets uncharged, though. Just for my presents so far.

I asked him about bitcoin out of curiosity about his answer, not the answer in general.

As far as I know, you are not allowed to sell bitcoins for euro without a license in germany. I'm telling you because I had something similar in mind and dropped it because of that restriction.

I'm gonna buy into the forks after you folks have sold all of them, then others will follow and then I'm rich and BTC is gonna crash :D

I will probably later, because I need the transaction in the evening to work for my paper wallet I want to give to a friends birthday, so I will see if someone can help out. Thanks!

so finally I guess I sent two times the amount I needed. Bad luck this time, but better learning with a small sum.

hey, we are from the same country actually! wait... where are you from?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:24:12
so the integrated client encryption is open source? probably it is, since the client alltogether is opensource.

I resubmitted the transaction with coinomi, which would be the easiest task to do, I had to pay 2 eur fee though for this 1,5 eur transaction. So, I think it will work out now. We will see.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:19:20
I have added more information in my first post. I have imported the first and second key, but it shows +x and -x and therefore a balance of 0. So I probably can not make a spend now, I am probably missing a key from the change of an earlier coinomi transaction.
// Maybe I should just try to make the spend with the first key, which shows full balance... I think I did not yet get the full functionality of a blockchain.
// So, if I import the first key, it still show a balance of 0 after one transaction.

Be careful about replay, as far as I believe you will move your BTC if you try to move your S2X Coins.
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:35:54
hard time for mining farms to come. Hope they have still savings. :D
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:14:03
what about replay attacks, where you have valid transactions, but get no confirmations?
@_date: 2019-01-06 20:25:39


Can you explain more about that one, how can he "get caught" by whom, and who is able to disable his channel then? I know I am not an lightning network expert, so forgive me.

bitcoin.org announced on August 1st: Do not trust any payments you receive after Tue Aug 01 2017 02:00:00 GMT+0200 (Mitteleuropäische Sommerzeit) until the situation is resolved. No matter how many confirmations the new payment says it has, it can disappear from your wallet at any point up until the situation is resolved.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:08:59
If you created the wallets before August 1st there are no risks
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:14:37
if seed phrase is according to a bip then every other wallet that implements that bip will be able to be used with it.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:18:37
and core has replay protection, too. So absolutely no reason to panic...
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:19:27
I guess it's too late now.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:47:38
I believe it should be possible to fork in two directions, as long as the two networks are still connected, that's not a problem. So it should be possible for core to move into smaller blocksizes, and for cash to move into bigger blocksizes. however, as soon as someone finds a way to disconnect the two bubbles, it might become a problem in the future. There would be a completely centralized currency, and a completely decentralized currency. I can not tell what would happen if something like that happens.
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:48:41
thats plain wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:56:11
I don't understand whats going on?
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:48:31
This is possible, although only done by 1 person business with trust from people that no private keys will be kept, using a highly secure system, printing or written by hand and not using other currencies than bitcoin. Not many people I know are able to fullfill all these requirements. But I know there is someone who has already had that idea for physical bitcoin certificates in an european country. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:18:53
Is it actually safe to extract the private key(s) from bitcoin Core and note them down? This is a paper wallet, isn't it? Of course you can not send money to it, since it is a private key.
