make back?  lets think about this.  this guy is a blue collar worker apparently and saved his whole life to invest in bitcoin.  tell me how in the fuck can someone make back 300k when it took him his whole life to work for that?  its not that easy.  for 90% of people, a loss like that is the end.  i can see why he did what he did.

japan wont ban it. australia wont. lithuania wont, . there are more countries that will use it. china wont mean shit

didn't china say that the ban affects some neighboring countries? so that would put north korea in their crosshairs to enforce that law.  the last thing we want is the world finding out that china is letting NK make money with BTC.  bad press
