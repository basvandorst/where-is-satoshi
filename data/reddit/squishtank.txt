Also if you take them out how the eff am I  going to unload for fiat when I need it?

When is a 24-7 platform closed?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:36:37
Hell I'd send my address what the hell could it hurt?   Lmao 
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:41:30
Hhahaha.  Our economy is booming and with the tax cuts it will continue booming.   I 10000000000 percent guarantee you the usd isn't going anywhere.   The Chaos that would ensue would prove too much for most of the super rich bitcoin folks from years ago.  Yes that's a nerd reference.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:41:22
Sideways movement and a hack in Japan.   And bitconnect is a scam.   That's all 
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:06:45
Yes you can.

Why so salty?   They've treated me fine 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:21:42
Hmmm mine does and binance does as well.  I get a load email 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:55:44
On one you're looking at tether and one you're looking at usd.    Usd and usdt are not the same 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:10:25
It's not.   Buy litecoin and ethereum.   Problem solved. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:48:03
Send your cryptocurrency to me and I'll pay you cash.   Pinky promise 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:11:05
Yes but if bitcoin is 1000000 then fiat will not be worth what it is now....  So being a millionaire won't matter much.  
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:02:10
Is that you ELEVEN??
I've seen stranger things.  ��
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:16:58
You get an automated email from them.   For setting to transfer and when completed.   Check your settings.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:18:05
Litepay visa card for litecoin is coming in February.   Going to be awesome.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:39:40
Did you get an eggplant response?
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:17:38
Yes it will.    As well as crypto to crypto.    If it's a gain it's taxable.    If it's a loss it's a write-off

Twidle your thuumbs and check the market every 25 seconds.   
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:34:56
That sounds like a phone problem.  My iPhone six s doesn't get hot and I run it all day.  Only gets hot when I'm using it and it's plugged in charging. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:54:45
What are you going on about?
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:52:20
This is not a thing......   
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:05:34
Use gdax instead of coinbase.  It's free to transfer money to it and cheaper to send.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:35:24
Just go have a cold one with the boys
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:34:10
You don't.   You go buy lottery tickets and hope for the best.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:44:57
Hahaha 
@_date: 2018-03-10 03:09:42
Fuuuuuuuuuuuck uuuuuuuuuuuuu

@_date: 2018-03-07 17:47:34
Research for 2 seconds they have been compromised.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:30:30
Aweeeee thank you so much.   
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:35:10
Lol hell no.   Recovery to what?   It's just a whale splashing around 
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:10:01
No idea.   But I  am good with it.   Lol 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:30:10
Looks like it 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:56:17
That's the basics.  But they are up and running here in us.   Just haulted withdrawals.   I  was online when via rocketed.  It was the fastest pump I've ever seen.  
@_date: 2018-03-23 15:55:54
Right......    Lol 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:03:56
Baby don't hurt me.  Don't hurt me no more.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:42:55
I think it will rebound temporarily soon and they'll start back up.   
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:31:41
Should've hodl.....   You're the one to blame not your friend.   Sucky 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:44:48
