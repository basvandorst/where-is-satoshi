My troll sense is tingling. But! If I ever feel the urge to do this, and I may, to quote a Leeds hip hop artist; I will find you, and make you walk up them

Really nice idea. Why the compass though? Have not heard of this.

Thanks. I really hope this doesn't sound like I'm blowing my own proverbial trumpet. I just want to be able to point at something and then pin people down and explain ;)

This must be a repeat/re-attempt of mt gox?
I also find it interesting that in a community with a vested interest in maintaining security and liquidity, that a post pointing out failings is downvoted....

ah, then I will take that as my cue to shut up :)

That makes sense. I transferred them all in one chunk to blockchain.info ages ago, so I guess the TX fee will be relatively low. I guess it's a risk/cost decision; is the high fee situation likely to change? I.e. Will sitting it out on blockchain.info and accepting the risks involved with that outweigh the cost of moving it now? It's an interesting conundrum

So why use bitcoin if it's just converted back to traditional currency? And in this scenario, bitpay ends up getting a horde of Bitcoins and benefits from rising exchange rates?
