Yes, ... cotton paper. It's still paper.

IIRC, not long after it went over $30 the first time, it crashed hard after that.

That's not actually what Schumer said; he seemed to think all there was to bitcoin was the Silk Road and money laundering but he never said that bitcoin itself was (or even should be (although he probably does think it should be)) illegal.

Nah, I think he's saying your AAPL shares and corporate bonds and income and fuel and liquor and so on aren't taxed.
@_date: 2012-04-02 17:23:42
OK, but who're you betting against? Everyone saying it's a scam is too chickenshit to put their money where their mouth is.

Wrong. A bitcoin and an orange are more different than a bitcoin and a dollar.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:34:10
Anything less than that would be unreasonable.

They borrow from the regular banks because it's illegal for the ECB to lend directly to them. As for saying "it's a democracy"  somehow legitimizing this "tax" and then saying immediately thereafter that the debt isn't legitimate because it's "loan shark rates," you're not making any sense.
It being a democracy does not legitimize anything. Democracies do evil things all the time.
I don't expect people to agree on taxonomy here, but here it is, anyway: taxation is a subset of theft. Theft is taking something from the rightful owner with the intent of permanently depriving that owner of it.
Whether you think taxation is moral or not does *not* change that you are taking it from someone that has more right to it than you. 
This type of tax seems particularly stupid economically but I don't see how it's morally any worse than other taxes.

Most of the roads around here started off as private roads and aren't maintained for shit anymore, they've never done anything to make me more secure without first endangering me, they never taught me to read and write and those protectionist stategies you speak vaguely of, what? I don't care for "intellectual property" by what do you mean by "fed your community" and how is that a good thing.
I'm not even an anarchist but you arguments are silly.

People always miss that point about monopolies; while government is often defined as the institutions holding a geographically-limited monopoly on the legitimization of force, one could just as accurately call it _the_ monopoly of a defined geographical area.

Yes, no one outside of America has ever heard of a French word.

Fair enough. Citations needed. There are massive incentives for people to test different pieces and publicize the results if his claim were true. I'm not aware of a single case of this.
I'm not saying they should be trusted but saying there ought to be evidence for alleging fraud does not mean there is or isn't fraud.

They had no part in the fork, made no petition for a bailout, and understand the risks of probabilistic returns. This was something Gavin did of his own accord with his own bitcoins. That people donated to the faucet under the impression it could never be used for something other than handouts to the uninitiated is an issue but I'm not aware of a promise he's made to only do that with the faucet and the faucet is stupid, anyway.

I see this as a likely way for miners to launder money in the not-too-distant future.

Well, that depends on their other entrepreneurial interests. Either way, transaction fees are the only way to really "find" money in the bitcoinosphere (i.e., not having the recipient explicitly designated in some form by the sender). Even with some rather silly amounts, it creates plausible deniability.

"Unwise" is definitely not the right word to use there.

That's ok if you don't get the language that comment was in; nor did the commenter. It looks like someone without ever having studied French for a day just opened up a dictionary and started "translating."
