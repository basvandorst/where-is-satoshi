Stop being a complete retard.  Did you ever ponder the idea that these BS 'time traveler' posts are from the grand methed-out-McAfee himself?  Trying to keep himself relevant?  He's on the run - the Tether scam is falling apart and he was in on it with his buddy, Brock Pierce.  Just go do the research.  They are going to prison.  His price predictions were literally what the Tether criminals planned on doing if they didn't get caught.  Even Brock Pierce said himself a couple years ago, if Tether was not created, BTC would be stuck at $2,000.  Literally go look at trading stats on the major exchanges, especially Bitfiniex.  Over 93% is wash trading.  The average BTC volume of real money is only $400k per day.  Just go look.  It's hilarious.
Look at McAfee's recent tweets.  He even mentioned the "time traveler' has been accurate in the predictions.  Who the fuck is retarded enough to reference a 'time traveler' on reddit, of all places.  Some guy commented his Tweet disputing it, and McAfee responded, "why does it matter what the source is?".  Use your brain.
"Oh, but the US doesn't have jurisdiction for Tether!".  The exact same thing that happened to Liberty Reserve is going to happen to Tether.  Ha, Liberty Reserve was in over 42 countries and was much more 'decentralized', but it was shutdown over night by the US.  They can do whatever they want - the US is a juggernaut.  We fucking invade countries and you don't think the US can stop Tether?  The US seizes the domains and sends out 'memo's' to those involved saying if they touch another single Liberty Reserve dollar, or in this case Tether, the are shut out from all future US financial markets.  They can never open another bank account.  They can never get a credit card.  They can never get a loan etc.  The Liberty Reserve guys got 20 year in federal prison, imagine how bad Tether is going to get it.
You are so naive.  Please, please keep making us laugh.
