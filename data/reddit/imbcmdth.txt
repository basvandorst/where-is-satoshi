Bitcoin is crazy.

Yes, it is inevitable that the banking world will eventually implement something very similar to the bitcoin protocol but the result won't be bitcoin anymore than a gold is just a dollar.
Even so, there is no reason to believe that they wouldn't try to kill it off while adopting something similar that they control completely.

Your post assumes that BitPay has no coins of their own with which to start off the process.
1. You order something for 1btc @ $100s a coin. BitPay immediately liquidates a coin they already have. They gain $100 cash.
2. 10 minutes later the vendor sends them 1btc. BitPay now has $100 and 1 btc from the transaction.
3. BitPay now sends the vendor $99 back ($100 less fees). BitPay has gained a total of $1 from the transaction.
Doesn't seem like much by itself but do this 10k times per second and suddenly you are making good money.

If you assume that human productivity and population will continue to increase forever then yes, one day a millionth of a bitcoin could be worth billions of dollars *provided people still wanted to use them.*

Almost makes me wonder if a portion of the current price rise is due to another exchange attempting to shut Bitfloor down permanently..

Do you mean like creating a virtual currency for a university (MITCoin here we come!) that only works on clients connected to the uni's network? Because that is as easy as filtering blockchain traffic at the edges of the network with routers and firewalls.
Of course, all it would take is one annoying student to setup a VPN...

Everyone says this like it is so obvious and all those people who bought at $200 were so dumb.
What is a "high" price? What is a "low" price? The point is that you can never answer that objectively.
Because the value of something is a consensus opinion, the fact is that literally *everyone* is already "buying low and selling high". The people who lost big just didn't (or couldn't) realize that their "low" was actually the "high" (for a while at least).

ITT: People who have never taken an economics course and think it is all fake and silly. 
These same people will use terms defined by the *dismal science* like "supply vs demand" in order to rationalize their fanatical support for bitcoin but then turn around and mock economists for their stance that deflationary currencies cause far *larger and more sustained* boom-n-bust cycles.
A currency that deflates is very dangerous. Any debt become a "debt of mass destruction" as hording increases and the price of currency sky rockets. The economy grinds to a halt as people store currency instead of spending it in the hope that it will be worth more tomorrow.
I must wonder: How did the volume of trade on, for example, Silk Road look during the bubble's growth? 
I am willing to bet it slowed considerably. Now, extend that slow down to a global economy and you have the answer for why deflationary currencies are dangerous.

Economists don't just imagine things, run some projections and proclaim them law. Economics is a *social science*; the study of human behavior in the context of *history.*
Many countries used to have either gold-backed or silver-backed currencies. For much of human history, these currencies weren't an issue because of the large concentration of wealth among a few noble families. They essentially conspired to keep the prices stable because it was in all their best interests.
Then things changed and wealth was began to spread. Some non-noble people started having extra money and started investing it in things. As the hegemony was lost, so was control over the price of the currency and it would have several devastating periods of deflation that bankrupted people - farmers, homeowners, small businesses. Pretty much anyone with a loan suddenly found it very hard to stay afloat.
*Yes* - this situation was largely engineered by a group people with wealth and power but bitcoin, without any "big brother" to protect it, can be manipulated just easily as the tycoons of yesteryear did to the price of gold and silver.

Let's look at this from the point of view of someone that isn't a geek:
1. Ok..
2. I don't understand what you mean by "save that page". How do I save the internet? I guess you mean that I should bookmark it.
3. How do I know that a computer is secure? I think we use "wifi" for the network. Do I have to call my mobile phone provider to disconnect?
4. Wait, so now I go back to bitadress.org? This is so confusing!
5. Oh forget this!

Bitcoin is deflationary *right now* (or will be very shortly - see edit) because each year there are fewer and fewer coins created and the portion of currency added is a miniscule fraction of the total number of coins
Think about it this way, gold is deflationary too but we keep mining more gold. It just so happens that the amount of gold we do mine is a small fraction of the gold already in circulation and it continually gets harder and harder to find new sources of gold.
EDIT: This is from the top of my head, but I recall that economists consider a currency deflationary if the supply increases at a rate below ~2% a year. For bitcoin, this would be around 2025. Which, in human years, isn't really too far off.

It may increase in *value* while decreasing in *utility* as a method of facilitating trade. If you knew your coins would be worth double *tomorrow*, how many non-essential items would you ever consider spending money on *today*?
Even if you were foolish enough to answer, "Lots! Why not? I believe in bitcoin!", remember that most people don't care about nor follow your beliefs. Most would horde (a good majority) and this would bring trade grinding to a halt.
How many bitcoin-only retailers could survive a long period of drastically reduced sales because everyone is hording coins instead of spending them?
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:30:17
Ok, as long as you don't consider it a type of "currency" I can see the appeal.
Although I must say that I worry about all the bitcoin-related services that seem to *think* of it as a currency. They are in for a rude awakening at some point in the near future.

I don't agree - it is still mining. The reward will never be *0* because transaction fees are not insignificant. As the number of transactions per block grows, there should come a point where transaction fees exceed block rewards (even before block rewards drop to zero).
The fact is that real mining isn't just pulling rich gold ore out of the ground (blocks with rewards) but also includes extracting very gold-poor ore and making money off of sheer volume (blocks with just transaction fees.)

By my (admittedly crappy) calculations, I predict that the block-chain will be around 25gb in a year, about 100gb in two years, and nearing 500gb in three years.
EDIT: That is actually an optimistic projection. One of the worst ones I forecasted put it at 50gb in a year, 400gb in two, and almost 3tb in 3 years.
