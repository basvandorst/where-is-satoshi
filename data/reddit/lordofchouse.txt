How does one define a hardfork, for the sake of this bet? Seems like there's money to be made here...

Dunno, a 51% attack on the whole network only costs ~$280M in hardware. Attacking a small fork could be viable.

I'd pay good money to have and confined to a nice room together, with all the best amenities at their disposal, for 36 hours.

More like 5%
edit:Why the downvotes? Since signalling started 11/313 blocks have signalled for SegWit. That's about 3.5%, was around 4.6% when I posted.

Would wire transfers be cheaper though? My bank charges $20 in country, and $35 internationally.

Server costs would have been a better example.

Everyone still gets payed out in proportion to the global hashrate. By increasing the blockrate, you increase the number of orphan blocks and further penalize miners on slow and expensive networks. None of this incentivizes decentralization.

I'm not under the impression that Roger Ver is blocking anything, but  I do feel like his concern for the fee economy may be echoed by miners in their voting. It's not like 50% of the hashrate is in some forgotten cupboard - a "do nothing" vote is an actively conservative stance (for certain values of the word "conservative").

You're looking at BIP9 miner support, not segwit support. The site you link to has the right number of segwit blocks but includes pre-signalling blocks in its percentage (0.33%).  is giving the more meaningful percentages, IMO.

I'd do that with rent. I know I have to pay it every month, so I'd rather just set it and forget it, unless I need to withold rent or transfer the lease or something. Then my account balance is reflective of what I can spend on variable expenses.

How are you getting your private key from blockchain.info? If you're using your seed phrase, you'll have to provide the (bip44 account) number corresponding to the wallet your address is in.
The instructions [here]( might help for the exporting part.
What wallet are you trying to import into?
