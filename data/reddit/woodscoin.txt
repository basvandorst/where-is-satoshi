Crypto is not a SOURCE of wealth, Bitcoin is very much a store of wealth. The idea that crypto, i.e. Bitcoin democratises wealth can lead to disillusionment because while Bitcoin does gives us sovereign control over our wealth it will not redistribute wealth to us. Sure, early adopters may profit from investing in Bitcoin but eventually everyone will get out of it only what they put into it. 
Essentially I agree with your broad point - if somebody works out how to corner our golden goose and keep it all for themselves they will even if it means killing it.

As transactions are trustless Bitcoin ideally renders obsolete a whole class of intermediaries (trusted parties) from commerce, removing their associated energy cost from economic activity. In practice a new class of intermediaries - the guardians of fiat onramps and offramps - arises in the stead of trust providers, negating these energy savings while charging a commission for their services virtually commensurate with traditional financial services.

People evaluate success for Bitcoin differently. A popular standard of success is 'adoption' which is achieved when  a majority of people have bought into Bitcoin and use it for everyday commerce. However if we think the logic of Bitcoin through to its conclusion, Bitcoin ultimately eliminates fiat from commerce altogether and there are those who regard this alone as success.

Crypto forums are full of whining losers. You know the type - whinging about their losses, crowing about their gains. Serious traders invest only what they are prepared to lose, they take every loss as a learning experience and blame only themselves. You may slander it if you wish but Bitcoin is the future of money and you have been overcome by greed.

Bitcoin has arguably supplemented the utility of electricity more than any other technology invented in the last century. PoW mining does not waste electricity it *uses* electricity to keep our wealth *safe* and *hard*.

PoW mining does not waste electricity it *uses* electricty to keep our wealth **safe** and **hard**.
The financial reward that PoW mining provides may prove a more effective incentive to pursue cost effective and sustainable sources of energy than anyone's heartfelt concerns for our environment.
Compare Bitcoin mining’s annual power usage of 30 terrawatts to that of the global banking industry, estimated at an average of 100 terrawatts. [

Most people including our great political leaders and trustworthy financial authorities don't understand it. Some have a working understanding but haven't thought it through to its logical conclusion. Some feel the fear but don't know how to combat it and are apathetic. Some few are aware of weaknesses but cant practically organize resistance on a scale sufficient to harm the network. Most of the worthy enemies of Bitcoin are actively fighting it tooth and nail using highly effective forms of warfare:  Spreading FUD and disinformation, misdirection, winning hearts and minds and making enemies for Bitcoin by attacking its reputation and setting up straw man objections such as PoW energy consumption. Making Bitcoin illegal will be a very late resort in this war.

Lightning network capacity is growing, the technology is developing, problems are being solved, off chain transactions are being paid. Other sidechains are growing too like Liquid. Bitcoin is scaling all around our ears.

The number of lightning payments you can make is limited only by the outbound capacity of your channel.

What if we said bollocks to adoption and came to love Bitcoin for its exclusivity and toxicity. Countless applications and services are being built on Bitcoin today because Bitcoin is a raison d'etre for so many. In the end you just wont be able to get hold of Bitcoin and it'll operate in a self sufficient economy. We want gainz right now I suppose.

Bitcoin may not be suitable for you.

Inbound liquidity is a real issue for merchants granted. We are working on solutions, e.g. submarine swaps, atomic multipath payments, channel factories, payment loops. Merchants accepting lightning payments right now are pioneers and possibly reckless.

You are quite wrong but you are right and the old platitude may be boring but its true. All wealth is a means and not an end but Bitcoin is more than currency.

You think it's 'lost'. If your 'app' says your bitcoin is unspendable you may simply have a watch-only wallet. If you have the private keys you should be able to retrieve the bitcoin.

By removing the trusted third party from commerce. Hence the rush to provide trusted third party services to Bitcoiners.

Keeping channels balanced is a challenge right now esp if you only make and don't receive payments but tools e.g. payment loops are being developed to enable recharging channels without closing them.

As I see it the primary value of Bitcoin is as Hard money. I wouldn't want to discourage the use of Bitcoin for transactions but the way Bitcoin wins is by becoming our default vehicle for *savings* and only when that has happened should it become our default means of payment. I am not going to use my Bitcoins to pay bills and expenses - that is what fiat and any number of shitcoins are for. The challenge we face is actually to retain enough fiat to cover our living expenses each month after routinely cost averaging into Bitcoin.

Forgive me if I regard your point somewhat pedantic. The white paper contains the original and complete idea. Certainly the detailed technical implementation of the idea is not included -  to me the real value is there in the white paper. It's one of the few examples of *Philanthropy* ever seen.

Don't despair. Yes the wealthy and powerful despise Bitcoin for now but ultimately they too must adopt out of self interest. This is not some doomed populist uprising it *cannot be stopped*. Bitcoin is the future and it is hard because we have to be patient and for some of us it wont come soon enough.

Arguments in favour of Ripple seem to me to defy logic. However I can imagine why people may find it attractive. People who have old money or are already well off/financially comfortable don't want the economic status quo disrupted. They are inured to the existing system and perceive an economic force that might subvert it, i.e. Bitcoin as inimical if not criminal. To them Ripple is a great technological advancement for retail banks that slashes their operating costs. They see Ripple as a chance to participate in the success of retail banks and it looks like a benign almost mainstream kind of investment, endorsed by celebrities and hyped with high-end marketing campaigns.

I agree it leaves a bad taste. Several arguments have been posted for and against the view that on the whole, cash settled futures depress BTC price. Aside from the logic of futures trading, the charts do seem to confirm a trend of significant BTC price drops roughly coinciding with CSF contract expiry dates. Granted CSFs are a drag on price surely we can't conclude this will kill BTC. The entire Cryptocurrency phenomenon (Shitcoins/ICOs/'the blockchain-tech' revolution) is the result of every man and his dog trying to make a buck out of Satoshi's Golden Goose. The potential of Bitcoin to render obsolete the class of intermediaries (trusted parties) from commerce and remove their associated energy cost from economic activity is in practice negated by whole new industries of intermediaries who at best charge a commission for their services virtually commensurate with traditional financial services or who at worst are plain, despicable scammers. None of this is a long term threat to the existence of BTC. People tend to perceive BTC as a way to make money, perhaps it would be better regarded as a way to conserve Money. BTC is hard money and at this nascent stage it has potential for monumental growth. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:32:31
I commend you for going all in on Bitcoin. If I may, a few caveats I should like us to consider: - Bitcoin is not a business, those who understand it as such tend to think that Bitcoin owes them something and through impatience come to regret purchasing it. Bitcoin is not really an investment, those who understand it as such expect a return on their principal and in shorter terms have a great chance of being disappointed. Bitcoin is neither a business nor an investment, nor is it a commodity. Bitcoin is a growth currency. When we buy Bitcoin we exit the fiat monetary system and enter a brave new world monetary system. 
@_date: 2019-05-22 14:24:01
Comrade. Bitcoin isn't an investment it's a currency. Like holiday makers we are pleased when the foreign exchange rate for Bitcoin is favourable against our dominant currency, i.e. fiat. Only if the Bitcoin economy is completely circular and self-sufficient does it ever come truly into its own.
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:45:32
From where I stand, the current market position appears favourable presuming that by position you mean current price. BTC is so cheap right now it beggars belief. To me the adjustment in difficulty is also encouraging. We are seeing BTC behave as expected. The reduced difficulty increases mining profitability which offsets the low BTC price.
