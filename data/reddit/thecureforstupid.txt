We are already on the moon. I can buy pretty much anything online with bitcoin, even though I may need to use a proxy service. I can get a bitcoin debit card and buy myself a beer in the supermarket with bitcoin.
It may not be direct wallet-to-wallet transactions, but all I see on my end is bitcoins. The 'magic internet money' is no longer magic nor restricted to the internet. It has become money.

Jesus christ, the 2k wall is down. This is madness.

It is called arbitrage, and I have been wondering all day why the spread is so high between the exchanges. My guess is the bank transfer takes a day or more, and we will see more cash hit the US/EU exchanges pretty soon. Christ, the Korean exchanges have been over 4k USD/BTC. That is a spread of over 1.3k USD.

One coin to rule them all
One coin to thrash them
One coin to swing them all
and in the panic crash them

They state "0% trading fee" on their website, but it only lasts throughout 2013 as far as I can tell.

"sturles" is a norwegian early adopter. He has been trading bitcoin OTC for quite a while, and is likely innocent in this matter. He can be found on localbitcoins, bitcoinOTC and on bitcointalk, where one can see he has made hundreds of transactions and posts back in the very early stages of bitcoin.

This is hardly begging. They don't even accept bitcoin yet.
I just want to convince them that that there are lots of people out there that would be interested in using bitcoin as a currency for donating. 
And seeing as they actually said they were open to it in my email exchange, they would be an ideal candidate for showing the general public what bitcoin excels at (cross-border transactions without all the bullshit which banks make us go through).

In Norway (where I live), wealth and income is actually public, and anyone can do a quick search in the national database to find out how much money I have. 
I'd say that this advice is mostly for US residents.
