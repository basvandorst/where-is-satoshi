Max integer(2147483647) divided by 4164416 is pretty close to the current exchange rate. ($515) so maybe it has something to
do with that? If they used unsigned int to store values you would be able to buy an $82k meal

As a BJJ practitioner and Bitcoin enthusiast, I'm very interested in doing this. Who is organizing this currently? If no one is, I would be willing to escrow the donations and pass them on to the fighter. I am an active member in the bitcoin community and have been around for 3 years. I sold the first Porsche for bitcoin and am currently an ASICMiner distributor. Let's get it done!

Nothing wrong with being paranoid. I had my house broken into specifically to steal my batch 2 Avalon about a year ago. I live in a city with one of the lowest crime rates in the US and have never been robbed in my life, so I'm positive it was someone who came from out of my area.

I believe the bitcoin community is capable of handling more than one type of sponsorship, so why should we have to chose just one? 
With that said, running an event requires a lot of planning and an organized individual running things. Are you volunteering to take the reins?

Is it though? Bitcoin gets "hacked" all the time. I'd think a lot of bitcoiners may be interested to see what happens to the USD and Religion when a megachurch gets hacked.

GrapeApe is a good guy. He's also a miner so he supports the network. I've met him in person a couple times for some block erupter sales. Haven't had the need for a cab down there in Austin, but if I did, he'd be the first person I call!

Yeh, I wouldn't buy anything I don't understand either. He didn't tell others not to buy.

The first thing Adam told Colbert is "don't buy any!" Telling someone that Bitcoin is a good investment if you have money that you don't mind losing is not exactly an endorsement.
  The main thing that bugged me about his appearance was that Adam obviously didn't spend much time researching Bitcoin. And this is not just Adam, it's a common problem with the media across a variety of subjects. If you are interested in Bitcoin, I suggest you do your own research.

I am from the past. My father once told me "A man who bites his coins is quite a clever man indeed, Yet a man who hoards his coins is but a testament to greed" I'm delighted that coin biting has become a legitimate profession in the future. It amazes me that one can make a yearly sum of $100 from biting gold alone. Long prosper my counterfeit testing brethren!

That's correct, not completely free of fiat, but free of fiat between buyer and seller. We can put any USD price we want on the title, the buyer will most likely still be expected to pay tax to their state on the assessed value of the vehicle. Now if someone would only come up with a bitcoin tax payment service, you would be golden. Or maybe buy a prepaid credit card with bitcoin and pay your taxes with that...

Hey guys, I just learned from Adam D on Colbert that you can buy drugs with Bitcoin! This is amazing news! I can only assume that after Adam's shady first time BTC purchase, he has stocked up the NPR news room with enough cocaine to get them through to 2014. 
Congrats Adam for misrepresenting yourself as a Bitcoin expert and bringing the Colbert audience up to the speed with the latest misconceptions circa 2011!
@_date: 2013-04-26 18:11:06
This is interesting, most of the issues I've seen were the other way around. Buyer says they never received the BTC and PayPal is unwilling to research the blockchain event so they reverse payment or lock the seller's account. I may be willing to sell if they have taken a new position on BTC sales.

You can outlaw businesses and exchanges in your country from accepting bitcoin, but this will not stop the currency. You can not globally outlaw all exchanges. In order to purchase something anywhere with bitcoin, all one needs to do is exchange bitcoin for their local currency, in a country where it is legal. 
Governments need to figure out a way to work with Bitcoin, not outlaw. Outlawing will only move potential exchange and business tax revenue to another country where it is not outlawed.

Thanks, it took some pressuring to get users out of hoard mode, but ultimately, people need to spend some coin to legitimize it as a currency.

   I'd be happy to clear some of the common misconceptions circa 2011 that you share with Adam. The misconceptions I'm referring to are:
1) Bitcoin is only good for buying drugs
2) Bitcoin is completely anonymous
3) Bitcoin is a bad investment
- Misconception  -
  While you can buy drugs with Bitcoin, this is not mainstream usage nor is it the most beneficial quality. Personally, I have sold a $40k Porsche and thousands of dollars in electronics equipment. A couple of weeks ago I purchased 5 domain names with Bitcoin through namecheap.com. Bitcoinstore.com is a large electronics distribution site that is making record sales.
  Bitcoin is a decentralized universal currency which holds value around the world. There are no central authorities telling any individual where they are allowed to send money, and no businesses skimming fees in between transactions. Because of this, Bitcoin is great for overseas transactions. I challenge you to find a bank or wire service that can transfer $2000 to a relative overseas in minutes with a transaction fee of 10 cents. 
  This is not my quote, but saying Bitcoin's sole purpose is for buying drugs is like saying the 100 dollar bill's sole purpose is for snorting coke. 
- Misconception  - Completely Anonymous-
  Every user on the Bitcoin network stores a record of every transaction that has ever occurred in the blockchain. Although each party in a transaction is represented only by an address, it's easy to trace every transaction that has occurred with that address. You can trace back to the exchange the user purchased the coins on, or eventually, the perpetrator will transfer funds to an exchange to sell. 
- Misconception  - Bad Investment -
  Fluctuating daily value can be attributed to the speculators, not Bitcoin. These misconceptions, along with issues at MtGox, led to the crash from $30 to $2 in 2011. The same misconceptions, and issues at MtGox, led to a crash from $250 to $50 in 2013(Now at around $100). This crash was 3 times less significant and is recovering much quicker. As with any new investment in the spotlight, you are going to see fluctuations caused by day traders cashing out. Just looking at the bottom of each crash, Bitcoin went from $2 to $50 in 2 years. It's an amazing return on investment, no matter which way you put it.
  The key here is that Bitcoin is a long term investment. It is extremely undervalued at this point, and the market is having a hard time keeping up with its growth. As Bitcoin moves from weak to strong hands, you will see its value steadily climb.

He's never heard of bitcoin, yeh right... Yours truly with the last item in the list of highest selling items for the week!
