Hey i got it all mostly solved through.the help of someone on /r btc
My last issue is the original electron wallet has the unconfirmed transaction of me transferring bcc that i didnt (when i had it on the btc network)
So i cant move it as the balance shows 
Balance (-balance) so theres no funds technically even though the coin is showing

I believe it may have to do with them being officially legitimate in NY now, just had to pull around 100usd out 24h perfection, two weeks back 50usd was 4 days held up.

Is there a way to refresh the tx? Like it was when i moved my btc to a new electrum wallet. The coins shouldnt have moved
Dunno why the tx is still there

Deleting the wallet file won't delete my  seed?
Trying to just be able to use my wallet here on her comp,
Then later restore seed back to my original home PC..
The pass I am gonna use on her comp is like jarbale language and numbs
She would never guess it it's jibberish would like to maybe not delete it in case I had run into this situation again.
So I has seed, restore from existing, use,and presto.
Then afterwards wouldn't mind leaving it as there's no way she'd guess the pass without brute forcing for 1million hours haha
Edit iPad autocorrect is best service
Forethought if yes : my pass would work on my comp only and hers on her comp only,
And I'd be able to send, receive, and trade all of both wallets as if they act like one being?

like i said to the poster below, is whats happening now.
electron b wallet is saying unconfirmed parent (the one the coin was supposted to be going to)
electron a just says unconfirmed.
balance is = balance (-balance)
if i right click either and press show in blockchain i just get an error message on the website cant be found

Hey guys, i posted a thread about this but was directed here. 
Hey all, So i downloaded electron wallet and automatically my BCH was already in it, is there anything more i need to do at this point? anything you guys recommend? I thought i was going to have to sweep my seed but it just came up by itself with the correct amount and my log of transactions.


Edit: just made a new electrum wallet and sent my btc to it, now all the sudden electron cash is reflecting 0 bcc??? HELP? I thought they were on 2 different chains how the hell is this possible? It says it was sent when i sent my btc, its to the same address?


Edit 2: Okay, so i just made a new electron cash wallet, imported seed and the funds are there. Now i just transferred 200 dollars worth of btc into my electrum wallet, and my electron cash wallet is reflecting the incoming transaction as well. What am i doing wrong here?
so confused. really nervous i screwed something up royally and am gonna lose some money one way or another here. please halp.
