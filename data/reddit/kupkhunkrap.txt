There is no way to allocate 'tickets' into the system without someone trying to create millions so that they can win. 
There is no easy way to identify 1 person 1 ticket to make the system fair.

I didnt read your novel up there but to answer your title, sort of.
The balances will all stay the same, no funds will be lost.
The ledger will be safe on the various forms of backup that survive.
The network will be down / extremely limited due to the internet backbone likely being severed and nodes relying on various mesh networks and the blockstream satelite. 
Miners will likely turn off equipment as power restrictions come into force.
Once internet and cheap electricity is restored miners will start coming online mining a very difficult to mine chain resulting in extremely slow blocks. Multiple chains will occur if countries local internets are still not connected.
Any coins that manage to get into blocks will be trading at an extremely low price. 
If peace continues then bitcoin will rise through the ashes and ultimately it will still be a token immune to seizure, inflation, cencoship and in this case nuclear war. Anyone who kept their seed on titanium in multiple places will be able to restore and regain access to their coins. 
Can we say the same about USD in a bank??? I dont think so.

If you want to sell your gold, stocks, bitcoins, there is someone else on the other end buying it.

I don't think you understand.
The cost of this forum is less than the profit they get.
They are profiting at the expensive of our privacy. They are feeding us targeted ads further perpetuating the consumption mindset.
They could provide this service with way less tracking and it would still be free.

You honestly will see close to zero accepting it unless you go out of your way. A big exception is biccamera which are truly massive department stores with close to anything one could ever want to buy. Think wallmart inside a 5 story building. These accept bitcoin. There was a report recently that their software didnt recognise a new tx format so maybe take an old screen wallet like electrum for android to pay just incase.
