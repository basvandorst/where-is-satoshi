Apparently, this was before they began the manipulation campaign. If Bitcoin Cash is the "true" vision and appeals to more people or is more useful as they purport then it *will* be successful without any of these carefully considered tactics. Does their use of these tactics imply they don't really think this? 
Especially considering these tricks quite blatantly turn off the entire Crypto community and only work on new-comers....these actions would seem to be more of a hindrance than a benefit if they truly believed their fork could be successful in its own right. To be honest from what I can tell there is something *extremely* fishy about their behaviour.

They were all unarmed and all but three were civilians. Can't even keep your own propaganda stories straight:-
- Dr. Salah Albardawil in which he claims 50 of the approximately 60 dead in protests along the Israel-Gaza border Monday were members of Hamas.
Hamas is a political party, if you vote for Trump are you no longer a civilian? 
The same official in the same interview:-


Yes, they were unarmed.


If you believe his account in the first place then you believe the above too. But these, too, were unarmed.

If I understand correctly this is a means to remove the 2hr wait described in the original post? What exactly happens to that 2hr wait time in this scenario? Does it simply not need to occur?
I think this is probably one of the most important parts of the entire article because literally everyone will be comparing the start up usability of this system with the usability of Bitcoin Cash. Everyone knows Lightning will offer better usability once inside but adoption is about physically showing people the system. As everyone reads the article they immediately notice this 2hr wait and assume BCH has this system already trumped. That's not a good thing and might not even be accurate based on your explanation.

Tim Draper shouldn't do public speaking unless he learns to speak more directly and coherently. He literally didn't make a single point in the first round.  EDIT: he came out of his shell afterwards, good job. EDIT: Actually he did brilliantly, he just waited to argue with direct points.
Patrick's points were very valid and intelligently thought out.
However, it's frustrating to see neither speaking about the use of Bitcoin today and whats unique about Bitcoin in terms of usability right now.
For instance, how else do you store 10M USD in a way that cannot be confiscated but can be taken around the globe with ease and reclaimed in almost any currency nearly instantly. WHY DOES NO ONE EVER SAY THIS?????!!!!!! Bitcoin is literally the ONLY way to do this.
The first counter speaker didn't raise any significant points. The second speaker misses today's utility entirely. (Edit: Oh god, go buy gold? Perfectly portable is it? You aren't even allowed to own gold in India. Gold was confiscated in the USA at one point. How do you get gold through an airport? How do you know your gold bars are real, drill through each one and test the middle? Then how do you sell it back to the mint. Bitcoin IS gold. Bitcoin is better than gold in almost every way.)
Got frustrated after the first round.
If anyone is going to do something like this again please message me, I guarantee I could convince just about every last person in that room to buy Bitcoin.
Edit: Central banks haven't been "pretty good", 20+ different countries have been in hyperinflation at one point in the last 100 years - this is the total FAILURE of fiat and the central bank.

You would take one friend and meet in a public place, if it seems legit you contact the other friend to lock the coins in an escrow, then the money goes AWAY with the friend you took.....then the escrow is released.

2 miners with 50% hash power based in one country and 100,000 full nodes or 20 miners with equal hashrate in 20 countries and only 1000 full nodes. Which network is more vulnerable? The answer is obvious. The government of the two miners in the first example turn off the electricity and the whole network is finished irrespective of their being lots of full nodes.
Decentralization is essentially entirely at the miner level. There can be no opinion on this matter. 
As to whether full nodes contribute I can see that they do. But lets not delude ourselves to their importance.

Will you drill into the middle of each of those bars at intervals and test the middle? Or test the outside and X-ray each one?
The above is precisely the reason I will never buy many gold bars, because you'd need to do it in front of the seller...and they probably will not even let you. It's so easy to smelt the gold, cut 50g out of it and put a tungsten square 50g back into it if you know they won't X-ray them. 
There are recent cases where central banks find their own minted gold is fake and refuse to accept it even when they sold it to the person trying to claim it. Gold is a joke compared to Bitcoin.

EDIT: So your rebuttal to "lol" got up-votes. Okay:-
I'm a professional trader and found your use of terminology funny because its completely wrong. Slippage occurs when you sell at spot price. 
Slippage is the market spread required to fill the individual order in its entirety. "Slippage over a few days" is just retarded. You're describing a limit order and using terminology that applies to market orders. It is literally nonsense.
Also the overall message in this post is also totally wrong. There is **huge** slippage in Bitcoin and there is slippage even in the largest Forex market pair EURUSD for even smallish+ orders.
If you market sell/buy 100 lots in EURUSD on a GOOD broker during PEAK times like the London open in a PROFESSIONAL account you will still often enter the market a half pip+ away from where you executed the order which will set off your trade in minus 100's USD right off the bat. I have opened trades in the past in EURUSD and been minus 500USD+ upon opening - so don't tell me about slippage in large markets. Don't even get me started on OTC Bitcoin.
For your information 100 lots is very accessible for a professional *retail* trader. Institutions can use hundreds or thousands, even tens of thousands. 
Anyway, I didn't want to elaborate because I couldn't be bothered at the time and thought "lol" would suffice as I incorrectly assumed other people in this sub had a better understanding and would "get" my post, but they didn't.

Literally the only media I quoted from up to this point where you can't actually see for yourself was Israeli. 
Why don't we hear from the woman in the video?
'This happened while away from the fence and no one around us was throwing stones or doing anything else... people were sitting, watching from afar while trying to keep safe. But there was nowhere to be safe, neither by the fence or away from it.' 
Here's a good one, an unarmed guy running away gets shot in the back by the IDF:-
Would a full powered rubber round that could snap a bone not have been sufficient? He just HAD to die?
Look, in the comments another person like yourself - brainwashed - says he was hiding a weapon in the tire and others picked it up. So here is another angle:-
Just *had* to die did he? Good shot though to the IDF, they must have been pleased.
Here's an example of them *using* rubber bullets and it working perfectly well. So they know about these. So why live rounds so often?
IDF sniper shoots an unarmed man doing nothing then celebrates the murder:-
IDF criticized the person who filmed it for exposing their practices. All of these are within a few months of today, btw. There are endless videos like these.

Tweet is dumb. You do rely on miners even if you have your own node. Running a node is like owning a router to connect to the internet vs using a shared router, there is less trust involved in a way but the end user experience is essentially unchanged.

You should consider that the lightning network isn't static. As soon as nodes were taken offline new nodes would go online and there would be an economic incentive for this too.

You are severely gullible if you really believe this. According to even your logic (that the btc tx count is less because they now use BCH) your numbers don't add up.
Bitcoin is using Segwit and Batching to lower TX count while Bcash has two twitter implementations, counter party and I'm sure other uses that everyone in r/btc ask people to use *specifically* to *raise* the TX to give the appearance of it being used and *still* barely scrapes 10% of the TX count of BTC. So to say 30-40% makes it abundantly clear that you have no idea what you're talking about.
The subscriber count means literally nothing, I was subscribed to r/btc until they banned me and I think BCH is a bad joke.
Edit: As the concept of batching clearly eludes you let me quote another post in this thread:-

But I also see one set of civilians being murdered in droves in poverty and another set that are totally fine and prospering.
But tell me again what all of this has to do with Israel using live rounds and not rubber bullets?
Tell me what this has to do with Israel not building a wall that prevents there even being a risk of protestors getting through? Turkey just built an impenetrable wall along their entire border with Syria. Israel have massively more money and massively smaller borders but they don't...am I a genius for coming up with this?

I just personally wrote the following to them, feel free to reuse. It's a perfectly valid and honest stance that they should seriously consider if they truly want to appear impartial.
The is a fundamental error on one of the most important pages of your website. 
The Bitcoin.com Forum belongs as an official resources for Bitcoin Cash, which is what the website promotes in it's entirety. 
Please consider for a moment If I make a website called Ethereum.com and make the entire website about how Ethereum has been determined as useless and Ethereum Classic is the recommended choice would you list it as an official website for Ethereum? Would you recommend is as an official resource where the vast majority of the present community disagreed with it? Only, I must repeat, ONLY if you intended to mislead the reader.
If the website did not clearly state a preference then there would be no influence to perceive and your direction would not represent a stance - however, if the website clearly intends to influence the reader AWAY from one coin and towards another then it is clear that the resource is representative only of its favored coin. 
To be frank, because it is not accepted by the vast majority of the community that Bitcoin Cash is recommended over Bitcoin, guiding users to a website that implies this IS the case is making the decision for the reader who trusts your website as an impartial resource. This isn't fair.
I trust you will consider this objective letter and do the right thing.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding something, but they literally told everyone they would not hold an ICO. The implication of this was that the project *isn't just* a money maker. Then they hold one in secret instead. To me "ICO" translates to at the very least questionable and at worst scam.

EDIT: So your rebuttal to "lol" got up-votes. Okay:-
I'm a professional trader and found your use of terminology funny because its completely wrong. Slippage occurs when you sell at spot price. 
Slippage is the market spread required to fill the individual order in its entirety. "Slippage over a few days" is just retarded. You're describing a limit order and using terminology that applies to market orders. It is literally nonsense.
Also the overall message in this post is also totally wrong. There is **huge** slippage in Bitcoin and there is slippage even in the largest Forex market pair EURUSD for even smallish+ orders.
If you market sell/buy 100 lots in EURUSD on a GOOD broker during PEAK times like the London open in a PROFESSIONAL account you will still often enter the market a half pip+ away from where you executed the order which will set off your trade in minus 100's USD right off the bat. I have opened trades in the past in EURUSD and been minus 500USD+ upon opening - so don't tell me about slippage in large markets. Don't even get me started on OTC Bitcoin.
For your information 100 lots is very accessible for a professional *retail* trader. Institutions can use hundreds or thousands, even tens of thousands. 
Anyway, I didn't want to elaborate because I couldn't be bothered at the time and thought "lol" would suffice as I incorrectly assumed other people in this sub had a better understanding and would "get" my post, but they didn't.

Would it take you 5 years of studying to understand how to put your Bitcoin on a hardware wallet? Because doing so nullifies the other point you made about there being so many mistakes you can make....

There is more infrastructure now than ever before, more regulatory approval. The SEC and CFTC are now pro-Bitcoin. This gives it essentially a guaranteed success at some point and I say "success" because you're selling because the price isn't making you happy. Well, if the SEC encourages the stock market makers into Bitcoin and it goes to 100k USD you would be happy.
So to address this point, its a step back in one respect, but HUGE steps forward in another similar respect.


You can't really think that? There are new lightning wallets coming every other day it seems, these wallets will also hold the watch towers, so these are not issues for exchanges. The rate at which the lightning network is growing is literally astounding. This point is objectively nonsense, you cannot argue this.


The ability for institutional investors to enter the market is only now starting to arrive. In the last year we have derivatives, futures and options....we are still waiting for an ETF and only recently Goldman sachs and NASDAQ have said they plan to open Bitcoin exchanges. Are you saying that your analysis of the market beats theirs? Because obviously they think more people want to enter. Seriously, answer that question, do you think your analysis beats theirs?


Wow. As a holder of 5 years you cannot tell me what is *different* about Bitcoin compared to alternatives? I think that is pretty shameful. If you want me to elaborate here I will, but I imagine you already know why Bitcoin has been referred to as a "modern miracle" by the CFTC chairman to the entire UN 2 days ago.


Agree. The blocksize needs to be raised. I think the companies that depend on Lightning to be successful will be able to rally support around this idea when its required.


So if China unbans ICO's what happens? If Korea unbans them what happens? Also, see my points above relating to the SEC and CFTC - do you really think the speculation is gone, ergo your understanding of this space beats two of the largest companies in the world. Yeh....


So the entire thing has grown so much bigger than you that you can barely participate and so this indicates it could not grow more....because no one is wealthier than yourself. Come on.

Or the financial freedom to take money out of a country even if a court is after your money? Or to protect your assets in a bankruptcy because it can't be confiscated? Or to be able to trade in a non-local currency because your government banned usd and your currency is inflating?

Are you being serious? You said that people would not mine. That's wrong, the majority still mine and all the largest pools certainly continue. You're clearly new not to know this when it has actually happened in the past. Even now as the price is dropping the hash-rate is raising. Flies in the face of your theory, which dictates it should be rising and lowering with the price of BTC and the respective profit margins of the individual operations and people should be less willing to turn on machines when its less profitable to do so.

Because you already paid a year for the rental of the hole digger? So why not use it?
Come on...I clearly did address that:-




No they aren't irrelevant!! Almost all businesses go into debt to start functioning and many many of them lose money in the first years. Besides these mining businesses made FORTUNES in the run up to December. They aren't just going to fire everyone and sell their equipment, turn it all off because it starts dipping out of profitability. They just won't sell the Bitcoin and wait.
In fact, why don't you check your theory by looking at the hashrate - has it been dropping in anticipation of non profitability?...no it's been rising, actually. Why? They're all preparing to turn it all off and downsizing, firing their workers as the price drops, according to what you've been saying.

So funny. If someone wants to buy that hole its going to be more than 100gbp. They wont sell for less than its WORTH to produce.
Your own analogy makes the opposite point youre trying to make lmao.
If someone invested 10M usd in December and have a 2 + 1 rental contract they dont just move. Nor do they just 'stop mining'. They pay their overheads and wont sell their Bitcoin. Thats the pretense of the floor once everyone else thats planning on selling DOES!

Looking at his post history this guy is being serious. How perfectly representative of r/btc. You can respond.
Edit: I just saw your response to me calling me a troll, you got triggered because I pointed out BCH is controlled far too much by Ver and Bitmain. You are just like this guy above. I'm suddenly a troll and deserved to be banned when I say something against the r/btc OFFICIAL narrative. Which is why I got banned in the first place. Touched a nerve. Funny how you changed your stance isn't it. I hope everyone from r/btc can see this, it's EXACTLY what I was talking about.
Go on, answer this guy who thinks we are the same people. You two are cut from the same cloth. I'm happy to let the dimwits argue among themselves.

What are you talking about the 24hr volume on exchanges alone is billions of dollars. You'll set a limit order and let someone buy through it if you have time or if you want to sell it all at once you can just use OTC.
The min. buy/sell for OTC is 500k USD on some websites and the lowest I know about is 100k USD. It's PERFECTLY normal to sell/buy multi million dollar orders OTC. The OTC exchanges literally don't bat an eye lid to it as it's the standard order size.

Instead of making all these great new techs on top of lightning maybe it should actually be made usable in the first place? When even enthusiasts can't get it right there is literally no hope of interesting normal people. The entire concept of adoption is gaining *new* people.
Edit: r/btc linked here before I edited, I just want to say to you all, look above how impartial I am.....I'm banned in r/btc and was done so after my first post there after I pointed out all the predictions made there which went wrong (flippenings etc). The reason was "ban evading" which was a total lie. I think my name touched a nerve. But yeh I can talk shit here and *still* post but I get banned for literally nothing there and you lot say *this* sub is censored. 
Re- edit: Look, you have to filter your information through r/btc to be able to know if its true or not. That's the state of the community, hearing it from the actual person's mouth isn't good enough. It's only real if everyone there says it is:-
Yes, I got banned after almost my first post there because what I said rang too true. First everyone from r/btc said I was lying. Then it was pulled from mod logs and they said it was from "ban evading", what the fuck does that even mean? Total bullshit.
Now months later you can see I'm literally a normal person that even talks shit about blockstream/lightning and only now you r/btc people can see objectively that r/btc is a fucking narrative pushing marketing tool.
And I only get to write this because I still have a look there and saw my post was basically linked in a thread.
re-re-Edit: IN FACT I had so many r/btc idiots telling me I'm a liar I had to post a screen shot of the ban. Then that wasn't enough so I had to post a video, ONLY THEN(!!!) did someone acknowledge the mod logs. They were content with me being a liar right up to the point it was impossible to continue and did not expect the backlash. Only when cornered was it admitted.

How do we get more merchants using BTCPay and not SHITpay (Bitpay)?
Lightning will kill Shitpay's business model, which will only be usable with BCH because they have to wait 10 minutes per confirmation which is impractical for an online purchase - thus *needing* a third party intermediate (Bitpay) for viable online purchases which, derp, is exactly the OPPOSITE point of Bitcoin.

Yeh, because I just went to buy a VPN and thought it would be a good time to use LN as I heard someone accepting it. You have to email them and discuss the details by email. What?
By that point I already sent the money to the LN wallet for 0,01USD and I was thinking, why don't I just use Bitcoin for this? It would be done by now. No, what about when the fees are higher. So I checked for shops that accept LN and they all seemed similar from what I found (emailing them to place the order!), plus its very limited. So I sent it back to my wallet and didn't bother trying mainnet LN yet. Damn.
I want to use LN. I'll even buy things I don't really need. Please BTCPay get this set up asap.

Was it nodes that prevented that or other miners with a larger share of the hashrate than the miner who tried to insert it...?
If it was a majority miner I suppose they would split but as long at the financial institutions were running a full node they'd stay on the correct chain. Likewise to those running their own nodes, but the ones that weren't would risk moving to the cheating chain - So yeah, I guess the nodes are kind of responsible.

Hm, not at all. I read that you're involved in the financial markets and offered some advice on money management. Which seems incongruent now that its clear you have no idea how money management in trading actually works.
I will explain briefly so you don't think I'm just trying to be rude. In trading you shoot for a positive win **ratio** between how often you are right, the percentage of your account balance that you trade and your SL:TP (stop loss to take profit ratio), winning 60% of your trades with good money management means you can profit. Can you be right 60% of the time over 500 trades? Hell, you can *guess* and average 50%.
Edit: In fact this is where the guy insulting my profession completely misunderstand T/A trading. They wait for the trader to be wrong and say "told you so" completely missing the point, you're only shooting for an edge.
Edit: I might not even be making my point clear enough, imagine this:-
1.) SL 3p
2.) TP 10p
Ratio (including slippage, roughly): 1:3
You have to be right literally once out of three trades, 33% correct to essentially break even. That means if you're right 50% of the time you'll profit from this very normal SL:TP ratio. Screw 70% correct, can you be 50% correct and spot the right set-ups?

It's a problem if its an electronic item. Not as much for other items. But certainly problematic in physical purchases.
My point is that there are too many conditions for it, it loses convenience to a system which has no such problems. Like Lightning intends to have.
I strongly considered the concept of 0 conf and made a lot of inquiries about people actually accepting it. Literally no one but unheard of start ups are prepared to take the risk right now.
Basically, before RBF in Bitcoin the set up was the same as BCH is now. Who accepted 0 conf in Bitcoin back then that *wasn't* a start up? Of those that did which *didn't* get cheated? They were all start ups and they all got cheated at one point.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:29:33


Not really, its pretty clear. We have been expecting a large move up or down out of a formation that has been building since mid last year (clearly visible on the weekly charts).
The move we've just had broke the formation short, however, it will have caught many people off guard who are probably pissed they didn't get to short/sell at the right time.
These people will be waiting for the price to retest the breakout level before entering (short/sell), which is around 7000USD.
If the price does start to bounce from this level its a valid trade short which could go for a thousand dollars based on the chart.
If however the price breaks back up through 7000USD then a breakout of the original formation long becomes possible and will be even more aggressive because it will be aided by the failed trades short that opened yesterday.

To be honest, I thought you were just being a troll, but after this response I can see you are actually like this. So I just feel sorry that people like you even exist with the mentality that no observation/personal experience or view is valid without a recorded and statistically valid data set. 
"This slide is so fun"
"According to you. Did you ask everyone else? No? Then it's just your *opinion* that this slide is fun. Unless you have data to back it up?"
 
Every one of my examples was essentially the above, being terrified is being excited, to be excited aroused, stimulated. It's basic English, again. Light sensitivity caused by prolonged dilation and then a bright light is a physical and normal biological reaction. Bullet ants hurt. There's no evidence for it (you're talking about being shot? I don't know why), you'll have to trust their personal experience.

Okay, so that's clear - you're issue is not whether or not that they back their Tether with US Dollars, its that they don't keep, word for word, to their statements. That has NOTHING to do with the issue at hand. Which is whether or not they back their Tether with US Dollars.

Not sure its a good idea to make them interchangeable as it effectively doubles the number of "Bitcoin" in circulation. 
Edit: -14? This went well over your heads: 
Think about it nice and slowly: if two coins can be interchangeably used instantly in all scenarios then one can be purchased in place of the other and still used in the same way there is no difference between buying one over the other. 
Edit: -16 Jesus, I'll leave an example, you guys are pretty simple now days:-
Used interchangeably, the shop wants Bitcoin, but Litecoin is just as usable because its automatically convertable when I send it. So I'll buy a load of Litecoin instead of Bitcoin because it has cheaper on chain fees and a lower price, so there's more upside with equal usability (so its massively under priced), then if I want to buy something with Bitcoin I'll just send the Litecoin. But I'm hodling Litecoin, not Bitcoin.
Without Atomic swaps the person had to buy Bitcoin and had to hodl Bitcoin as their long term investment.
Please tell me someone is actually getting this extremely pertinent point?! It's really freaking obvious what I'm saying is valid.

Ahhh so annoying. Even in your example you explain the concept you say doesn't exist:-


In your example above the person doesn't sell for below its creation cost unless he HAS to.
The equivalent is the miner using fiat to pay over-heads and not selling his Bitcoin.
If the miner has invested 10M in Bitcoin and bought a building and hundreds of mining equipment, he probably made at least a few million profit from selling Bitcoins during the ATH period. RIGHT?!
So he has enough capital to last literally years at this point, without even going negative. So using your example he doesn't HAVE to sell and he won't until he needs to feed his family.
When all the weak hands have sold their Bitcoin and there is only the NORMAL **demand** left, and there **will** be a demand in some capacity - at that point only the miners are introducing new Bitcoin to the market. But they won't until the price hits their production cost (as a minimum).
So yes the price can dip below this cost, but only for a certain period, after that it will raise to meet the costs required to begin reintroducing new Bitcoins literally due to *supply and demand*. That also assumes a steady, non rising demand.
There, I wasted my time so you could actually understand that it was YOU all along who misunderstood the concept of supply and demand and how production costs *does* create a "floor" under normal circumstances.

@_date: 2018-06-14 20:00:23
Interesting concept. How could you differentiate between authentic requirements to take an action vs faked requirements in that case?
i.e the fees are constantly at 50USD, no one new is joining/using the Lightning Network and basically everyone is annoyed at the Network fees/delays. Is this the time to take action or some group of people trying to force an action?
Because if the situation arose where a critical action *was* sincerely required and nothing was done then the only fix is people leaving Bitcoin full stop - which means adoption can only happen through lightning which is only possible when the fees allow it. Which is obviously not a situation where adoption could "explode" as it has done at times with other new technologies.

It's not an Audit, it literally states that it isn't. It's proof that Tether is completely backed by USD in a real bank account, which is exactly what "Bitfinex'd" was saying was not the case. Whether or not its backed is the concern and its provably back in entirety. The FUD is over.

This implies the articles were posted to raise karma, but they were downvoted. 
Also, at least one of the accounts was inactive for 2 years, which indicates the Karma was already harvested and the account was aged and sold. The first suspicious activity was the negative posts. This indicates that the intention of the account, after purchased, was to post these articles.


You informed me that the links were legit, so its not this either.

@_date: 2018-06-09 07:04:38
Bitcoin cash represents a minority of the original Bitcoin community who were determined to scale Bitcoin using big blocks but after years of trying did not gain enough support and so split from the Bitcoin chain.
The people who actually created and designed the initial split is a very powerful company called Bitmain, hence my name. They are the main producers of ASIC (the computers that mine Bitcoin) in the world and have essentially a total monopoly on the production.
This in effect makes them the owner of the entire Bitcoin network, i.e if they stop selling to everyone and just use them all for themselves they have total control over the network using their hash power.
Those who are affiliated with them absolutely love this idea, obviously. The problem is Bitmain became so rich they were just able to buy up the other companies, so obviously, they started to.
The rest of the community, which is the majority by a long margin right now have been fighting back against this attempt to centralize Bitcoin's control.
This has spurred Bitmain to actually hide the extent of their hash power by creating new companies and giving them the hash power and then pretending they are independent. Which is not the case.
This is the bare bones of the situation. HOWEVER, it gets more complicated, because while having bigger blocks helps large miners to gain more control (due to hardware limitations right now),  having small blocks gives companies who want second layer systems an entry point.
So essentially on both sides you have manipulations, Bitmain and his affiliates alongside other large miners who all want big blocks to give themselves control. Then on the other side Blockstream who wants second layer systems and require through-put limitations to make them viable in the first place.
So on this basis you have to look at what is logically a better situation:-
1.) A Chinese company headed by a single man cornering the entire cryptospace for himself and everything that entails for the reputation of a global Bitcoin.
2.) An artificial cap on blocksize that reduces on chain throughput, changing the original structure of Bitcoin but maintaining all its original use cases/intentions while remaining totally decentralized and unstoppable.
Edit: For a reference on me, I've been in the space since the beginning and have done extremely well in this space. Better than most people here could dream of to be honest. I'm totally impartial and literally only care about the price going higher while having longevity to the system through decentralization. I see through every manipulation from both sides but I can tell you the big blockers in r/btc are the bottom feeders of the entire space and will literally do and say *anything* and this has been shown literally hundreds of times through the years.

Yes, I got banned after almost my first post there because what I said rang too true. First everyone from r/btc said I was lying. Then it was pulled from mod logs and they said it was from "ban evading", what the fuck does that even mean? Total bullshit.
Now months later you can see I'm literally a normal person that even talks shit about blockstream/lightning and only *now* you r/btc people can see objectively that r/btc is a fucking narrative pushing marketing tool.
And I only get to write this because I still have a look there and saw my post was basically linked in a thread.
Edit: IN FACT I had so many r/btc idiots telling me I'm a liar I had to post a screen shot of the ban. Then that wasn't enough so I had to post a video, ONLY THEN(!!!) did they somehow find the mod logs. They were content with me being a liar right up to the point it was impossible to continue.

Ok, well how about the recent the statement here by the former head of the CFTC (which is the organization which will aid the SEC in their determination):-
But Mr. Gensler said Ether could have more problems **because the first Ether tokens were sold in 2014, before the network was functional, by the Ethereum Foundation.**
He is specifically referring to the "PREMINE" and referencing *who* it went to, which is exactly what I have been telling you and you telling me is bullshit. So you realize now that I'm just telling you what the ex-head of the CFTC has been saying, but I suppose because he just described a premine here and didn't use the specific terminology it's all just bullshit to you, right? ....and there is more but you can find it yourself if you're worried about the bags you're clearly holding.

I wonder if you'd find Bob Volmans books interesting. 
Have a look at this chart and narration, the red arrow is an entry. The "20" levels are round numbers. 
SL on that trade was 2p and the target the standard 10p. If you only traded these set ups you could be right 30% of the time and still profit long term. Obviously you could get 0.5p slippage which has to be considered.
If you traded 10 lots on that your risk would be 200USD and you'd make 1000USD if it wins. Because its scaling on the 70 tick chart you'd have plenty of opportunities.

Like the rest of your post, admittedly not reading the report, this is based on........nothing. The entire point of the report is to prove that if they *need* to produce the USD to back the Tether, that they can. Tell us how this was not proven by the report. You wouldn't know because you didn't even read it.

My previous post is relevant to an earlier post of mine:-
The move we've just had broke the formation short, however, it will have caught many people off guard who are probably pissed they didn't get to short/sell at the right time.
These people will be waiting for the price to retest the breakout level before entering (short/sell), which is around 7000USD.
If the price does start to bounce from this level its a valid trade short which could go for a thousand dollars based on the chart.
If however the price breaks back up through 7000USD then a breakout of the original formation long becomes possible and will be even more aggressive because it will be aided by the failed trades short that opened yesterday.

Given the topic of conversation, how trades may or may not effect the global market then participation is in this context. Unless you intended just to make an isolated statement for no particular reason. What you described is participation in the Banana market in the same way talking about Bananas is participating in the Banana market. The rationale: If enough people made that individual private transaction it would have a knock on effect to the stores, who would up their Banana purchases from a supplier and this would, if it occurred on a large enough scale, feedback to global Banana prices.
So if enough people talk about Bananas this encourages more people to buy Bananas and the same thing happens. Advertising is "participating" in the market. But in a literal sense, in the context of this conversation, it isn't participation in a global market. That's the significance of bolding "THE" in your statement, THE Banana market.
So if you want to talk in such a general sense, to the extent that the same logic applies to a lot of people just *talking* about Bananas and the knock on effect that too has then be my guest. However the statement in the context of the topic is wrong. 
As an isolated statement, what was the point? If you want to talk seriously, and not be pedantic, in a direct sense the question of whether or not a private sale of a single Banana has a direct effect, a tangible effect on the global Banana market then no, it quite flipping blatantly doesn't. No reasonable person would argue it does either, hence "Jesus christ, no it doesn't".
Look, if I transfer Bitcoin from my wallet to my friends wallet, then take his car, did that change the price on any online exchange? No. It didn't. Did it participate in the Bitcoin market, the global Bitcoin market, no it didn't.
Edit: What you're saying is if you bought a chocolate bar from your corner shop in USD that you participated in the Forex spot market. It's literally mental. If you change my 10 dollars for 2x5 dollar notes, did we participate in the Forex spot market there too? They're private isolated transactions and do not touch the market. In the same way using Lightning channels doesn't touch the blockchain.

No it isn't, you've said nothing. You have just been issuing calls to authority, telling me to ask r/finance over and over again and occasionally making single line irrelevant statements, while not addressing a single point.
You have absolutely zero understanding on the topic and its pathetic and frustrating that ignorant people like you try and "teach" others.
I sincerely hope others read through this exchange so they can see just how hollow your "ask r/finance" arguments are.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:54:22
As a side point, the OP was not presenting anything valid, he has an agenda:-
    [–]curiouscitizen100 -4 points 12 days ago
    exactly, hopefully bitcoin goes to zero.
But to address your point, I understand what you're saying, but we have to look at reality. Has is ever not been profitable to mine Bitcoin? Yes it has and what happened? 


No, wrong, much of them continued. The very small mining operations stopped. So the remaining miners got a higher ratio of the coins given out, and this does not mean they sold them for a loss though. Who would sell at a loss if they could afford to wait? Literally no one. 
But if we use your example you indicate a threshold where all the miners start consistently buying Bitcoin when price reaches a certain level as a substitute for mining, therefore,  even in your example (for different reasons) there exists a "floor" which is determined by the cost to produce a Bitcoin, lol.

It officially and independently confirmed what we needed to know without being an "audit", does this concept confuse you?
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:16:28
Yes it is. The extra supply satiates demand.. So by buying off market they will no longer buy on market which means the 30mn that would have raised the price didn't and instead translates to a lower over-all demand and lower demand translates to lower prices. i.e because they didn't actively move the market up the market moves down...this is total nonsense.
...Firstly, what you described in no way constitutes selling pressure (if it even made sense) and for the second time no, auctioning creates ZERO selling pressure on the market. It's the entire point of auctions and it translates to moving coins from one wallet to another. IT DOES NOT TOUCH THE MARKET.
@_date: 2018-06-25 12:46:24
So you state as a fact that the production cost doesn't produce any semblance of price floor, but can't provide a single example where this consistently happens. Because quite obviously, it *doesn't* consistently happen. They either go out of business, or they weather the storm until they can sell for at least production cost, the effect for the product is a loose price floor.


Hah, no shit. Not a business model though, and if they can afford to not do it then they won't do it.
So if we take a general look at miners right now, who all just made a fortune selling Bitcoins at more than 4x their cost of production at times in the run up to December. You're trying to argue that they don't have spare profit to cover a dip into unprofitability long enough for the market to rebalance.
Basically, you have no substance to your point what-so-ever  because the only pretense that validates your assertion (miner's running with no spare capital) is quite obviously wrong for basically all the largest miners!!!
So, tell me again how there can be no semblance of price floor (okay, no rigid price floor, but that's not what you mean) established if the market rebalances (always does), with a similar demand and the miners won't introduce new coins to the market below a certain price?

You fundamentally misunderstand the terms you are using and what you're talking about.


No, they aren't. A market is public and buying/selling can be done privately.


No, it wouldn't affect the market. Because for this to be possible the coins are already private and not on the market. 
If you have a wallet with 10,000btc in it does it affect the price of Bitcoin when you move them to another wallet of yours? Yeh, exactly. That's what off market means.

With fiat profit they made while they were selling their Bitcoins at 15k USD. They have enough profit off that to sustain themselves for months before even going negative.


Because the invested their money in the property to house their miners and the miners themselves with the mind set that Bitcoin will increase long term.
Both of these questions were painfully obvious to answer, I'm assuming you were asking sincerely, not able to answer them yourself, rather than trying to make a point.
@_date: 2018-06-20 10:21:30
People should not give their money to things they don't understand fully. The intention of cryptocurrency is to be able to hold your money and not let anyone take it from you. It's the entire point, in a sentence: Sovereignty over your money.
Therefore, to miss the point entirely, invest in something which is essentially the opposite - well, you wouldn't feel sorry for someone who was convinced that their money would double if they burned it would you.

You don't get it because you're missing something. You look at the chart and can see its going to go down more so you sell to buy back in when it gives a reversal signal.
I never post bearish technical analysis so I'm not going to elaborate, but its easy to make money as the price goes down as well as up. You can't expect people not to take advantage of despair, the market is in tatters, its so easy to make trades right now just as it was in December.

@_date: 2018-06-13 17:21:58
Yes it is. Supply in market context is a verb.
The "supply" is the rate of new item coming into existence. The supply of diamonds is determined a private company who buys up all the diamonds that enter the market then drips them into the market.
The supply of gold is determined by the rate gold is mined and brought to market. If a mine shuts down the supply goes down and the price goes up.
The rate of *supply* of Bitcoin is determined by the miners and it halves itself until the total number of coins have been *supplied*. Then there are no more to be supplied to the market.
You're talking nonsense, no offence.

A man digs a hole and it costs him 100gbp. No one cares about his costs. 
 BUT If someone wants to buy that hole its going to be more than 100gbp. They wont sell for less than its WORTH to produce.
So if all the cheap holes get sold and theres a demand on the market, if all new holes cost 100gbp the people capable of supplying holes wont sell them until which price?
If someone invested 10M usd in December and have a 2 + 1 rental contract they dont just move. Nor do they just 'stop mining'. They pay their overheads and wont sell their Bitcoin. Thats the pretense of the floor once everyone else thats planning on selling DOES!

Any statement anyone makes in general conversation is, as standard, an opinion unless stated otherwise. *Not* the other way around. This is evidenced in everyday life by everyone, everywhere and is common knowledge.
"This sandwhich is really good" - it's defaulted as an opinion and their opinion so long as *reasonable* requires no data or evidence. 
"It's a fact this sandwhich is really good" - Now it requires evidence.
Looking at my statement:-
"Very well articulated. Another interesting dynamic of Bitcoin is it attracts intelligent and perceptive people before the "less so" (generally). So we get the brightest most curious minds. It's hard to go wrong."
1.) "Very well articulated" - This is a subjective statement, it begins the comment with an obvious opinion and has set the tone. 
2.)"Another interesting dynamic of Bitcoin is it attracts intelligent and perceptive people before the "less so" (generally)" - Because Bitcoin and blockchain represents some of the leading and most cutting edge technology in finance right now (this is based on large financial institutions stating this), its reasonable to assume that cutting edge technology requires intelligent people. Because it's very new and not yet widely used the fact that it already has these intelligent people developing it (see what I did that, I stated it was a fact) implies that the intelligent people came early. These are perfectly reasonable observations. What new technological industry *didn't* have intelligent people starting it and the less intelligent users following later, seriously?
The unspoken, and very obvious analysis, now presented above was represented by my "personal experience" and the reasonable assumptions derived from the personal experience represents the "common sense" in my response to your request for **data** to back up such a general statement.
I don't think anyone would say that in a general sense my statement is so unrealistic that it would require a literal *data set* before it could be considered a valid observation or opinion.
To be honest now we've gone back and forth, I'm quite confident that your original comment to mine was just venting about something that annoyed you in the past and you probably can see now that it didn't actually apply to what I had said.

Did you mean that some miners stop? The majority? Or did you mean all miners stop? If you say "the miners will stop" the implication is pretty direct that the majority will stop.

I feel like you're skirting round the actual points because they're so obviously correct and there's not much to say.
The miner's cash on hand dictates how long they can operate at a loss and that dictates how long it will take before they sell their coins at a loss.
I find it astounding that you're on the internet offering financial advice and you don't get that. Tell me where this doesn't sound totally obviously correct:-
"The miner's cash on hand dictates how long they can operate at a loss and that dictates how long it will take before they sell their coins at a loss."
If you can't work out, after having it explained extremely clearly multiple times, how the above dictates the supply / demand dynamic of Bitcoin, then, as aforementioned you have no right to be offering ANY kind of financial advice AT ALL.
I don't see why I should make this more obvious, but imagine a new business has taken out a loan. They're now in debt but they believe in their business model, they will even operate at a loss in the first year because the whole endeavor is an investment to them. However, they *will* sell their stock for loss and close down eventually, but only AFTER their available money has run out. i.e their free cash dictated when they would have to sell at a loss.
It's exactly the same principle with the miners, HOWEVER, they represent the ONLY new coins on the market.

Okay, so now its not just about them not keeping their word. The Law firm picked a random day and checked that day.
So, from what you're saying their statement on that is false and the only way they would make a false statement for the benefit of Bitinfex is if the Judges and Ex FBI boss colluded with Bitfinex to make a knowingly misleading report. If that statement is not false your point is totally moot.

"If the demand is zero, in spite of any and all recent developments in the real world, then there can't a floor from production cost."
Ok, but in the real world where there is a demand for literally everything with a use (people collect shit from the toilets in India to sell) once the market re-balances itself, the production cost ultimately creates the lowest selling price.
There is only one caveat, which is miners dropping out and conceding defeat on their investment, which lowers difficulty and lowers the production cost. The point to consider is that they all just made a fortune on the run up to December, so they can likely weather this storm for months.
But you don't even mention that, so it's obviously not factored in to your theory based analysis intended to "help" people understand "market theory" in a way that totally misleads in this context.

I don't think anyone is really understanding the point I'm making. 
Used interchangeably, the shop wants Bitcoin, but Litecoin is just as usable because its automatically convertable when I send it. So I'll buy a load of Litecoin instead of Bitcoin because it has cheaper on chain fees and a lower price, so there's more upside with equal usability (so its massively under priced), then if I want to buy something with Bitcoin I'll just send the Litecoin. But I'm hodling Litecoin, not Bitcoin.
Without Atomic swaps the person had to buy Bitcoin and had to hodl Bitcoin as their long term investment.
Please tell me *someone* is actually getting this extremely pertinent point?! It's really freaking obvious what I'm saying is valid.

@_date: 2018-06-27 15:18:46


You already made this point and I thought I addressed it clearly. I'll do it again exactly with your example.
You originally said:


In your example you want to buy 10btc, firstly auctions are not that common. So your usual choice is that you buy this on an exchange on that single order book (OTC is like using all the exchanges order books at the same time so less of an impact). You buy 10btc and you raise the price on that exchange 5USD.
Now, instead, you hear there is an auction of 10btc and you say to yourself I'm going to get some publicity so I'll buy them at the auction - for higher or lower price.
You buy them, it goes from the police wallet to your wallet and now you're free to do with them what you want but that is nothing to do with the auction.
The net effect is that you did NOT raise the price 5USD on that day. Instead you had no affect on the price.
Now you can argue that it didn't RAISE the price 5USD and so the market "lost out", but you can't argue that it created a selling pressure by not creating a buying pressure - that is obviously illogical. Please tell me you understand now.


Because trading and financial markets is my profession.
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:50:32
This is getting frustrating. You know OTC market orders and Auctions are TOTALLY DIFFERENT THINGS.
You're talking to someone who only trades Bitcoin OTC and has NEVER participated in a Bitcoin auction. OTC has negligible price impact compared to an individual order book and Auctions have...none.

Too many people are in this trying to make money in the short term, not preserve money in the long term. 
The thing is, the people who are still talking like this (above) are the ones who already learnt the lessons in this space and already endured a big rise and crash.
The last scary rise and crash was breaking through 1000USD and then crashing below it, literally just before the rise to 19k. So many people sold and said it was dead and the forum sentiment here was worse than it is now. I think this is the first time people ARENT saying Bitcoin is fully dead.
Being bitter about losing money is perfectly normal, the idea is, the ones with the strength of character not to get bitter are the ones that see through all of these crashes and who are now literally multi multi millionaires. They're still posting here, too...maybe you can guess how *their* writing styles are during this time?
The posts like yours literally just advertises that you made no money in this space and already quit, because if it wasn't the case you wouldn't be bitter right now.

Plus, r/btc is a total shit hole, most of the posts are insulting other people's positions and pushing conspiracies theories about literally everything. Go to their FAQ, the top response  from just over a year ago is "As someone who infrequently checks in, but has bitcoin... what actions do I need to take when btu becomes the majority?"
Yes, "BTU" Bitcoin Unlimited. Then it was ETH going to inevitably kill Bitcoin and now its Bitcoin Cash. Anyone that can actually fall for the paid marketing in that sub is literally fully retarded.

The report states that on a randomly selected day they had enough USD to cover all the Tether. Unless they're colluding with each other to mislead, as though three judges are part of a conspiracy to prop up Tether then, well, that's *exactly* what the report said. 


It's literally the only thing that the report said. Are you like that genius auditor who hates lawyers and knows its all lies because it came from a Lawyer, tells a story that refutes his only basis, all without having read it?


It did, it said "unencumbered" which means it is available for use immediately.


No, the report is clear, they had access to enough funds to cover tether on a randomly selected day. Whether or not the funds remain available is not part of the report and a separate issue. It's People like you that are trying to mislead by saying "Yeh so what if they could back it on *that* day". Which you could do forever. If they produced an official audit people like you would just find another way to poke holes. For example "That audit was up to this date and they were only monitored for 6 months...what about now".
It's clear people like you have agendas, just like the people who started the FUD and have been proven wrong. I'm actually starting to think there are marketing campaigns/brigading to propagate this stuff now, because looking at this thread there is no way this many people are this stupid.

It's difficult to form an opinion this early on. We are like the skeptics that were present when Bitcoin had no infrastructure. It's kind of natural but if people are working on it and its making progress what can you say? It does seem to have huge potential and we can only wait and see and hop on when possible.
I definitely don't think that constraining Bitcoin's progress as a whole was worth it up to this point though, I'm still pro bigger block size and still don't like BCH. I have no place to call home until other people in this sub realize the inevitable.

You have no idea who you're talking to or my experience, so why do you think I need to ask opinions? Also, why do you assume I'm wrong even though you can't come up with a SINGLE rebuttal yourself? Likewise, everyone else I've been speaking to in this thread has stopped replying. They, unlike you, have less commitment to their incorrect views because they didn't make the thread in the first place trying to "teach" people with....nonsense.
Just because you have some high school student Bitcoin supporters agreeing with the 2 sentences you wrote in your post as explanation doesn't mean anything.
Nor does having people who know literally nothing about Mining or Bitcoin offer their opinion, on r/finance.
The fact remains, there are no arguments against what I'm saying because its demonstrably true. It's not just me saying it either, there's wall street investors that recognize this too, as do the miners. For all you know I'm a Wall Street investor AND a miner, so I ask, what makes you so sure my understanding doesn't dwarf yours or the r/finance posters on this topic? Obviously, without a single rebuttal from yourself, it dwarfs your own...

This isn't part of the question, the question wasn't if under the right circumstances they'd support a *rushed* hardfork to a bigger blocksize. It's if they'd support it at all.
In the scenario you've responded to the Lightning Devs call for a blocksize increase, the time frame can be 3 months or 6 months or 24 months - makes no difference to the question. The question is: in the outlined circumstances would Core support their request.

Thanks for the reply. I don't see why I am even still banned, after it all blew up why wasn't I unbanned from the sub which *doesn't* censor? What am I saying that is so terrible?
r/bitcoin has strict rules, it's easy to get banned from here. It's apparently impossible to get banned from r/btc according to Roger Ver. But his own employees are the moderators and there's no way it wasn't known what happened. So what was it? What I said in the post, my name? What touched a nerve to the extent they found an excuse to ban me permanently. 
I'm actually pro-blocksize increase on Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin Cash is controlled by Bitmain and Roger Ver (plus a few of their friends). I like the idea of Lightning. I think the priorities on scaling are totally mixed up on Bitcoin.
Is the real problem that I'm coherent, convincing but see through too many things on their side (as illustrated by the post that got me banned) and that's why they don't want me there? 
The disgraceful thing is I'm free to post about the things I see through here without getting banned.

Well, quite obviously, Bitcoin isn't "destroyed". Someone asked me earlier what Bitcoin Cash is, I wrote the following, if you read this you'll understand exactly the intention of a video called "Why blockstream destroyed Bitcoin":-
Bitcoin cash represents a minority of the original Bitcoin community who were determined to scale Bitcoin using big blocks but after years of trying did not gain enough support and so split from the Bitcoin chain.
The people who actually created and designed the initial split is a very powerful company called Bitmain, hence my name. They are the main producers of ASIC (the computers that mine Bitcoin) in the world and have essentially a total monopoly on the production.
This in effect makes them the owner of the entire Bitcoin network, i.e if they stop selling to everyone and just use them all for themselves they have total control over the network using their hash power.
Those who are affiliated with them absolutely love this idea, obviously. The problem is Bitmain became so rich they were just able to buy up the other companies, so obviously, they started to.
The rest of the community, which is the majority by a long margin right now have been fighting back against this attempt to centralize Bitcoin's control.
This has spurred Bitmain to actually hide the extent of their hash power by creating new companies and giving them the hash power and then pretending they are independent. Which is not the case.
This is the bare bones of the situation. HOWEVER, it gets more complicated, because while having bigger blocks helps large miners to gain more control (due to hardware limitations right now), having small blocks gives companies who want second layer systems an entry point and way for *them* to make money.
So essentially on both sides you have manipulations, Bitmain and his affiliates alongside other large miners who all want big blocks to give themselves control. Then on the other side Blockstream who wants second layer systems and require through-put limitations to make them viable in the first place.
So on this basis you have to look at what is logically a better situation:-
1.) A Chinese company headed by a single man cornering the entire cryptospace for himself and everything that entails for the reputation of a global Bitcoin.
2.) An artificial cap on blocksize that reduces on chain throughput, changing the original structure of Bitcoin but maintaining all its original use cases/intentions while remaining totally decentralized and unstoppable.
A large company has a lot to gain on both sides, but for the normal user decentralized is the most important thing so your money is not just "disappeared" one day.

I think a lot of people will be buying before it gets near there. The next technical level is 5000USD. After that its 3000USD. Then there is no technical levels left, there are no levels left to base short trades from at that point. Which then means the only trades that can build up are actually long.
So what you'd expect to see and what I'm almost certain we will see is a total market confusion at that point which will result in sideways movement which will represent a bottom and at that point a lot of people will feel comfortable the bear market is over and will enter. People that have been waiting to enter since the break of 5k USD long.

Everyone sells Tether for BTC and withdraws it from Bitfinex which uses up all their reserves, Tether is bankrupt because they don't back the value of Tether with USD and can't rebuy the BTC. Then the BTC holders go to withdraw their BTC from Bitfinex and there's none left = crypto meltdown.
Ok, so this is why if you are paranoid you don't give your trust to a centralized service. Because any centralized service can rip you off in a similar way. Why only scrutinize Bitfinex in this way? Well, because they might not have any USD to back the Tether they print and there has never been any proof they do...oh, wait a second.
So your logic applies to every exchange not to cheat their customers then, doesn't it? ...and this is *nothing* to do with the Bitfinex'd FUD.

Then on the other side Blockstream who wants second layer systems and require through-put limitations to make them viable in the first place.
So on this basis you have to look at what is logically a better situation:-
1.) A Chinese company headed by a single man cornering the entire cryptospace for himself and everything that entails for the reputation of a global Bitcoin.
2.) An artificial cap on blocksize that reduces on chain throughput, changing the original structure of Bitcoin but maintaining all its original use cases/intentions while remaining totally decentralized and unstoppable.
A large company has a lot to gain on both sides, but for the normal user decentralized is the most important thing so your money is not just "disappeared" one day.

No, all I said was auctions do not cause selling pressure. You told me this is wrong. It isn't wrong.


OTC in Bitcoin means using a broker who has access multiple order books and can spread the order out in order to get the best price. The side-effect of this is less impact on the market. I literally trade OTC in Bitcoin. Probably one of the few in this *entire* forum.
An Auction is a seller to a single buyer, wallet to wallet and does not involve any order books. 
They are totally different. One can impact the price bullishly or bearishly and the other, the one we are actually talking about, has ZERO direct impact on price.
I'm sorry but you appear to be completely clueless on this entire topic but hopefully you've learnt something.

If the bank is holding real Bitcoin and people choose to let the bank handle it for them its their choice. It exposes them to Bitcoin, encourages the price up and increases the adoption - so I don't see how you can be upset.

Jesus christ, you couldn't even grasp the point of my previous post. Lets tally, you don't know when to use "then" vs "than" and you can't understand that you don't have data for every valid observation. Did you turn your computer on by yourself?
There's no data that sky diving is exciting, personal experience and common sense dictates that it is. According to your logic that's just personal bias.
There's no data that getting stung by a bullet ant is painful, but personal experience and common sense dictates it is. According to your logic that's meaningless.
There's no data that staring at a bright light when you wake up hurts your eyes, but personal experience and common sense dictates this is true. You're getting insulted because you're genuinely a total brain dead idiot and I have literally no qualms in pointing it out.

It is an investment to use it or hold it because there's a predictably limited supply and ultimately a cap on the quantity and its not widely used yet.

Price will keep falling until people stop selling. The people who understand the concept of Bitcoin understand that it will go back up, so you have to sit with a steady nerve until the others leave. We are just flushing out the normal people right now. I've seen it so many times, it will keep going down till a point of real despair and then it will suddenly turn around and all those people who sold will be furious. 
My judge is actually in this forum, when they all start down voting price positive topics, getting aggressive towards you if you say positive things about Bitcoin price. We are almost there.

This is your critique, but I do use it as a store of value and I know others do too. So your *opinion* that it isn't a store of value is kind of defeated by.....you know, reality.


It's legally recognized as a currency in a growing number of Countries, so again its your opinion vs facts.


"Modern civilization falls"? Ok, fair enough. What if the current financial system falls and which is more likely? 


If they allow crypto at all, they can't stop it. Given the G20 initiative it seems they aren't just allowing it but encouraging it.

So people bought Bitcoin even though they didn't think it would achieve its aim. So they bought it when it was going up to "make money" but actually, they lost money, so they sell to cut their losses knowing they can buy back in.

Hmm, it  seems RBF should be useful, if you sent the payment and the fees rose you could send a higher fee. But I suppose right now with the low fees its less needed and risky for the store.
It does seem a little convoluted to conisder all of this when sending a payment. Hopefully LN is able to resolve this situation for in store payments.

This is kind of semantics, you have to consider, if a lot of people use it as a store of value - because it doesn't fit a certain definition then that means its not used as a store of value? But what if it is?


The fact it *is* legally recognized as a currency indisputably flies in the face of your saying previously that it isn't a currency. Now you admit its meant to be a currency.


Then you're wrong on this point as well, you can't take 1M usd out of a country without risk of being caught. But you can easily deposit 1M of Bitcoin in btce and convert to monero and take it literally anywhere.


Name an asset that used Blockchain before Bitcoin. Name an asset class that is decentralized before Bitcoin. Name another decentralized financial instrument online. Name another asset class that has the potential to revolutionize finance. Name another asset that could be used as a currency in multiple Countries. Name another asset that allows you to recall an unlimited value using 26 words.
The fact you try to argue this isn't a unique asset class just reveals you as a complete idiot.

Every post you make in this thread reaffirms my prior assertion about your agenda. As I said in response to your other comment, also scrambling to defend their decision:-
" I delete old accounts and create knew ones. Am I not allowed to do that? Having bought into Bitcoin a long time ago I have a huge interest in keeping my privacy for obvious reasons. You are really trying your best to malign me, unsuccessfully, do you have an agenda? Desperately trying to defend their decision to ban me for no reason in spite of their "free speech" policy. Sure seems like you do."
P.S your attempt at "detective work" is as transparent as your agenda, I clearly stated that I've been here for years. Otherwise how would I know about how r/btc developed during that time, genius? lol.

I've said this in the thread already. I have only one account. I've been here since like 2013 and now regularly delete accounts for security as a large early investor. Make account, use it for a few months, delete it. You see, even writing this sentence means this account will be deleted in a few months max because I'm forced give this personal information in order to make a point - but it just makes me a target. I'm 100% within my rights to do this. I don't see why I have to justify myself when I get banned for making a totally normal point on a sub that claims they don't censor.
If you check my post history there is no trolling, I'm articulate and reasonable and contribute sincerely. Then I'm banned in r/btc for making a point that is *too* valid for them to refute.

What evidence do we have multiple people had access to his GMX email? If that was confirmed I would consider it confirmed that Satoshi was actually a name used by a few people. Otherwise they simply would not have had access. I would be interested in determining who the other person could be by looking at who else had a history of developing Bitcoin like protocols and was in contact with Nick at the time. My gut feeling is if it was anyone it would be Hal, especially considering he was the second person to mine and also developed a proof of work coin prior to Bitcoin.

I do just want to say something to this, trading is speculation because the future is never certain. The aim is literally to be correct 51%+ of the time and use money management to do the rest over time. This is how cheating on the casino was done in the past.
The thing with trading is that its actually possible to be right roughly 60-70% of the time if you are very good. So on one hand what you are saying is correct, but on the other hand making a prediction is actually worthwhile x% of the time when the reward is x% in size.

The two red lines are what I just described, I thought, perfectly clearly. From my chart we are in a decision making area, we visually are more likely to break down. But given how far we have already come it's a bit risky trading down unless you really think Bitcoin is going nowhere. I personally would not do this right now.
It's very possible to have a breakout down that gets reversed and ultimately breaks the nearly horizontal trendline (red on the chart), this will put us back into bullish territory. I.e searching for longs again.

They aren't better. There are as bad as having too big blocks. The point was to have time to optimize the entire network and not rush a solution which would make optimizations completely unneeded but ultimately result in centralization of the mining protocol. 
The problem was adoption was happening in December and small blocks ruined it for now. At least in the next bullrun it will have longevity. It's not a get rich quick scheme anyway.

Okay, so if we class 3 years as a long term investment and starting from each month in the BTCUSD chart* imagine buying in - how many times did it not pay off? The answer: It paid off for literally everyone. The next question is *why* and then *what changed*. 
I will then wager that in 3 years it will pay off for those who bought at 19,000USD.

You could have guessed the lottery numbers and won the jackpot too. Timing every high and low of the market simply isn't possible, but seeing the potential upside and behaving accordingly is very realistic. Is it more likely or less likely to go there again is the question. Well....everything that got price there the first time remains. The fact that LN is on mainnet now makes 20k USD an underestimate on this basis. It's just simple logic in my opinion.
The other consideration is equally simple, imagine if China unbans Bitcoin tomorrow, 20k USD would be hit within a couple of weeks just like that. It's pretty possible.
I'm personally not concerned at all about this correction.

Having bought into Bitcoin a *long* time ago I have a huge interest in keeping my privacy for obvious reasons. You are really trying your best to malign me, unsuccessfully, do you have an agenda? Desperately trying to defend their decision to ban me for no reason in spite of their "free speech" policy. Sure seems like you do.

Proof that batching is happening, or proof that batching reduces the number of on chain transactions? Well, nearly all exchanges are now batching and they started doing it to reduce on chain transactions. Doesn't mean you aren't correct too.

"When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin."
This could indicate that he was aware of the release before others, otherwise it would be rather lucky he happened to be the first person mining other than Satoshi. Also, quite a coincidence he had also already tried to create a POW currency just prior, *then* happened to be the first person who knew about Bitcoin.
The real question is this: If Satoshi took advice and bug fixes from someone like Hal immediately *after* production, why would he not have sought advice from *anyone* before its release? Logic dictates he would have told someone about his intention, if these records are not found publicly, we can assume that's because it was done privately ergo someone probably knows something.
Edit: I'm settled, Nick Szabo made Bitcoin, 100%. Nick Szabo in his 2005 paper on Bitgold (Yes, seriously) talks about things no one started talking about until after Bitcoin. 
 
These two solved the issue in Bitgold and released it under a new name and anonymous identity. He was a Lawyer at the time and considered creating money to be illegal. Additionally Hungarians switch first and last names, Nick Szabo = Szabo Nick = SN = Satoshi Nakamoto.
 - He slips up in this video. I struggle to believe everyone who matters doesn't know this well at this point.

"In the Hungarian language, whether written or spoken, these names are invariably given in the "Eastern name order", or family name followed by given name"
Szabzo Nick is his actual name. SN (Satoshi Nakamoto). Maybe coincidence.
2.) Nick slips up "When I designed Bitcoin...."
1:35:30 
3.) The precursor to Bitcoin, as you referred to it, was named by Nick as "Bitgold"....kind of important.
I think it's also important to include the *way* nick talks about Bitgold and his intention with it i.e he wanted to create a decentralized borderless internet currency that was not controlled by Governments - sounds familiar surely? The fact that *no one* else was talking about this in 2005 except him alone gives it away. 
I think it should be concluded by the community that it is Nick, it's quite blatant.

Even Jihan Wu, basically the source of funds for the entire project, finds it underhand what Roger Ver does and has even commented on twitter indicating this. Clearly a lot of people think Bcash NEEDS these crazy tricks to be able to achieve anything.

I agree. Which makes the case for them assisting each other to some degree because Hal was working on similar things albeit after Nick began. For example Nick began, got so far, reached out to Hal for assistance (or the other way, maybe Nick remained anonymous through this), renamed the project together and released under pseudonym. Hal was the second ever person mining Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:51:26
I don't think this is a predicament. People just use OTC. Or the broker is established as a trusted party in the first place.
Edit: You wouldn't try and sell 10k BTC through a brokerage company without providing them with proof of holdings and a buyer enlisted for a specific amount in the same company would naturally have to provide proof of funds. Or, why would the brokerage company bother with them in the first place?
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:10:26


I don't know If I'm being stupid or if you are. You understand the point of a futures based ETF is that the people don't *touch* Bitcoins? 
Having more instruments *around* Bitcoin that don't actually hold Bitcoin seems like a pretty easy way to manipulate it down. Prior to this it was not possible to manipulate it down because you had to buy it first, causing the opposite. 
An actual Bitcoin ETF that requires a reserve in Bitcoin would push the price up, however, this just looks like the end game for holding the price down indefinitely. If someone can explain why this is not the case with a reasoned response I'd love to hear it.

Pull backs allow new people to get in. They then don't sell until the price is higher. It's "healthy" as it is a normal part of the market, it shows its a real market. When it goes straight up people exit too fast on what would have been a "dip", causing a full on dump - think pump and dump vs real adoption.

No its to do with block propagation times. It means bigger pools have a considerably better advantage the larger the blocks get, smaller pools would end up having to stop mining. This is why certain large miners, or those with connections to the large miners, would have such a benefit if the blocksize was allowed to get much larger.
They themselves argue that technology/broadband should increase in efficiency in time so it won't necessarily be as pronounced. Others rebut that Moores law  isn't guaranteed to last forever, so it's risky just to assume things would be okay and that the blocksize could increase faster than technology could progress regardless.

My friend lives in a non-western Country, he bought into Bitcoin around 100USD with more than 200,000USD. He cashed out a lot of it above 15,000USD for the first time and is now a multi-multi millionaire just from this. He has bought land and property in his country.
However, if he cashes out the rest where does he put it? This was his question to me, he can buy gold - but gold correlates with Bitcoin and Bitcoin has more upside, also its impossible to transport and you have to trust an institution to store it. He can buy stocks *outside* his country, but US stocks for example have 30% taxes on dividends for outside the US, he can buy more property in his country but the economy is not that great so he could end up losing money there - don't put all your eggs in one basket and all that. He could cash it out to US dollar and hold it in his Bank account pending a new found investment but the Country could have issues like Cyprus and take all the deposits above 100k USD or he could cash it out and try to store it as dollars in his house knowing that if he ever needed to leave the country it would be impossible to take the money with him across borders. Bitcoin is the only way that would be possible at all.
I then asked him, if you wanted to buy stocks or any investment first you would cash it into your bank account right? Yes, he said. So I asked him what made him think his bank would allow him to send millions of USD out of his Country? This was the point he told me the obvious, holding it in Bitcoin was really his only option as he had no use for the money didn't want to. If it goes up or down is less risk than touching it and this is the only way it can't be taken from *him*. The fact it will more than likely hit 25k USD this year doesn't affect him.
The people buying in today will have the same problem as him in 10 years. By the way, in his circle of friends his situation is common. The rise of Bitcoin is not an accident, in spite of you maybe not having a use for it - that's because right now its only useful for people with a lot of money.

Best comment so far in here. People don't seem to get that you have to be in the Bitcoin market to move the market. Right now is the ideal time to get in, I actually think the rebounds are being caused a lot by institutional investors and once they've built their positions the narratives in mainstream news will change and begin to pump crypto. Then at the point that the average person begins to enter they will all dump their positions into them and buy back in at the bottom. For all we know this is what happened on the run to 20k.
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:35:05

Both of Bob Volman's two books and his daily trading journal for 3 years (free online in a forum). It's for scalping EURUSD but its pure price action trading, no indicators but an EMA and the EMA doesn't do too much. If you can understand these books, which will take time and dedication, you will be able to spot potential trade set ups literally instantly upon seeing the chart and your understanding of price action will literally piss on every single youtube trader out there (maybe not *all* but 99.99%).

@_date: 2018-04-08 20:14:08


It changes incentives such that bigger pools gain a new advantage, if there are 10 pools right now they find blocks based only on their percentage of hashrate. If the blocksize was 10GB tomorrow then the bigger pools would not just have a hashrate advantage but also an advantage relating to block propagation. 
So of those 10 aforementioned miners imagine 3 of the biggest pools together hold 50% and the remaining 7 hold 50% - with huge blocks immediately those 7 smaller pools would need to join together and create a single pool to be able to stay competitive with the 3 big miners. Then the remaining 3 might decide they too want to be more efficient and so they join together. Now you have 2 mining pools instead of 10. Now if you (or a Government agency) want to "turn off" Bitcoin you only have to target 2 pools - centralized.
The most important thing Bitcoin can possibly maintain is its decentralization, it should not ever be trivial for a couple of governments just to "turn off" the main Mining pools.

My jaw literally dropped. This is why having Roger Ver on our side was a good thing. The arrogance of certain people is the ONLY reason why we have this situation now. Unless people are prepared to do this kind of endless marketing that Ver does its very possible BCH will be taken very seriously as a competing implementation, very soon.
To be perfectly honest the only way this stops is if Bitcoin raises its blocksize and proves to the market that it will scale. People can put their heads in the clouds but I'm literally banned in r/btc so its blatant where my loyalties are, for now.

So when I wanted to sell my Bcash I should do it in batches of 5BCH, what if I had 10k of them to sell? I don't think it is fair to blame the people themselves when an exchange rips them off, I imagine to a certain extent it comes from a jealousy that the person offering such a comment could not ever be in the same situation because they simply don't have many coins. But the person who has the amount mentioned, or more, can feel more empathy as it is a situation they themselves could be found in one day.

Some random account then appeared and started telling me off for trying to make it public (in the comment section).
The next thing I did was search for his stance on Bitcoin Cash where I was *extremely*relieved to see he thought the same as myself. 
As a side point I heard somewhere that the reason he chose to hide his identity was because he was a Lawyer at the time of release and creating currency was potentially illegal and would at the very least jeopardize his job.

I regularly consider buying a *lot* gold and I never go through with it. I simply realize again that Bitcoin beats it in every way. The only reason to buy it is as a hedge to currency or physical assets like property. A hedge is only useful in a financial collapse/difficulty. But in a financial collapse/difficulty Governments confiscate, this is proven. If your Government recalls all the gold what will you do? How will you remove it from the Country? ...ergo it's useless as a hedge when it is needed.

This is my reply to the other person:-
"Yes, those are them.
Here's the thread, 460+ pages long. Bob volman actually posts his analyzed trades, based on what is taught in his book every day for I think three years.
You can compile his best examples into each style of trade, then practice only the most simple (Range Breaks). Also compile his notes on the charts into a guide. You should get 3 good trades per week on this set up alone. Also, only take trades at London or New York open.
If you can be profitable on EURUSD scalping, you will be astounded at how obvious the trades are in BTC/USD."
You should understand one thing very very clearly in trading, you have to decide what *style* suits you in terms of frequency of trading. One *method* from *one* mentor, and then study that *one* method until you have mastered it.
Trading is a game of *masters* who take the money from the people who are just experts. You can be an expert in 10 trading methods and the master in 1 will still be better off.
Also consider your end goal is simple, to be right more than 51% of the time. With this and correct money management you will win in the long run. If you can be right just 60% of the time then that's it, you'll be retiring soon. Trust me, when that time comes you will realize it is almost impossible to teach someone, you could take them to "pro", but only they themselves can go from there to expert to master.
P.S You should read some books to do with emotions in trading, from your last sentence I can see this will save you a lot of anguish. There is no "previous" trade(s), there are no future trades, there is only the trade you are analyzing in that moment. If its valid you take it, if not you don't. Nothing more nothing less. This is easier said than done :-).

I personally don't think it could be more obvious. He publicly had almost finished Bitgold around 2005, which was literally Bitcoin, before anyone had done anything like it. His aim was to create a decentralized currency and he was writing about it and doing it before anyone else was talking about it.

The only issue Ver took exception to was not increasing the blocksize at the moment he wanted it to. Well, LN requires the blocksize to increase to roughly 130mb in size. This will allow LN to reach the whole World WHILE keeping fees low on chain. Not 0,01USD low on chain, but sub 5USD fees on chain.
How is this not inline with the original plan? It actually seems *more* inline with the plan considering the way LN is set up there are huge numbers of individuals connected and part of the overall network themselves AND mining is less likely to be centralized thanks to a smaller end blocksize.

You can call it unlikely and I'd agree to an extent, but I also think they the people who lost out from their unscrupulous government thefts would love to move away from the Rupee with half a chance.

They've sent a notice that the ban is unconstitutional. There isn't much to defend against that.

I don't have anything to prove to anyone, I'm actually happy that you've completely misjudged me. I'm not bothered about a social media war either, I give my opinions, make myself untrackable and get fundamental analysis for trading and that's that!

God Dammit. That was really good.

I wouldn't post things like this when increasing the blocksize is literally in our scaling plan. A better analogy is "There's no need to improve the wheel's bearings when we can increase the power of the engine". Obviously its idiotic not to increase the efficiency of the engine/car and only increase the HP of the engine - if you want it to be the best possible you do both.
P.S Segwit did essentially double the blocksize XD.

By the time it gets to 12k USD it will be setting up to at least test (if not break through) the ATH, so my advice, my serious advice is do not sell at 15k. Sell at 19k. If you don't heed this advice you *will* regret it.

You are right it is too hard. It's a big flaw right now.
The process is sign up to an exchange, get verified, connect your account and THEN buy.
It *should* be possible to trade in a decentralized market place, but unfortunately Crypto isn't widely used enough yet.
Buying now gets you in on the ground floor so that when you *can* do those things you're already a millionaire. So you do have to accept the sacrifice right now.

This does sound very strange, a better chip alone should be significantly better....but with ASIC boost it should blow the Antminer totally out of the water. Can someone else comment on this? Is there really a 10nm chip in there at all?

I think a sticky in this sub showing Lightning Store acceptance is the way to go. The adoption of Bitcoin in commerce is now partially tied to the adoption of Lightning, given how excellent it is as a technology we are in a great position to encourage its use.

Their mentality is quite straight forward and logical. Why a complex solution that we know little about and can't immediately implement over a simple solution we know everything about and can do right now.
However, the more LN develops the more their stance of instant gratification is proved wrong. If it becomes fully apparent that LN will achieve its goals I think most of them will return to BTC. So get working guys :-).

That is fascinating and the fact you know about this and I haven't heard of it leads me to believe you are the right person to be asking about this. How certain are you that cash based futures and futures based ETF's will raise the Bitcoin price long term?
Thanks in advance.
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:18:33
Why don't you just explain it to us? I invited someone to explain:-


You responded with an insult, ignored the request to explain....its so easy to understand, which makes me ignorant for not knowing - yet you spent three sentences, that could have been used to explain, but you didn't.
Go on, elaborate for us....

Same. There needs to be more community effort to encourage its use.

I think Ver has ran out of money/financial conviction and the ship is slowly sinking. Only so long before Bitcoin.com  decides to stop trying to scam their customers.

You are a walking caricature. You did it again. Surely this is on purpose? You have an argument with someone online, get upset, and use it as an excuse to judge the entire space as "immature". Each part of that plainly represents immature behavior. Can you seriously not see that?

As a former professional trader I can confirm this. Teaching people to trade is literally the last thing on my mind. So you struggled for years studying, mastered it, made your money and then instead of retiring in another country spending your days on your yacht/porsche/learning to fly a helicopter etc etc you decided to not only continue with the insane stress that is trading but to teach other people to do it...for more money? It's just bullshit. The most you'll get from me is recommended reading, and I bet it won't be any use unless they want to study it 24/7 for the next year. Which basically no one wants to. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:42:08

They are actually many economies who have high inflation where holding USD means trusting the bank as it is not possible to store it efficiently in the home. In an economy where you would *need* to hold USD instead of local currency, leaving it wide open for the government to take from you is a *huge* concern. Bitcoin is the ideal solution to this as its easier to store/hide than gold.

Yes, also known as "Bitmain Cash".

Can you summarize? It looks like it allows you to change your transaction after its sent, sounds like a bad idea. RBF is bad enough.
