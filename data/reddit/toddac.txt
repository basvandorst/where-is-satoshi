Agreed. Folks wanted nerdy Batman, but ended up with a douchey Tony Stark and just can't deal.

I hear the occasional mention of things being built, but I've been hearing those mentions for years with no noticeable progress. What is substantially different between now and 2011 on this front? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:06:46
If they had millions of dollars seized, how could that not affect their business?  It might very well have been all the cash they had, for all I know.  On what basis do you say it's a "drop in the bucket"?
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:25:56
I know it's hard, but the basic problem of interfacing with banks isn't going anywhere, and it seems clear at this point that a magic bullet doesn't exist.  What reasons are there for optimism?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:45:26
I don't need you to be polite, I need you to make a case that what has happened can not be considered a direct result of their account seizure.  Nothing you've said so far proves otherwise.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:27:45
I don't see how fees would have anything to do with it at all.  "Capital required for ... turnover" is my point. Their capital was seized.  And I don't know what leaked document you're referring to.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:14:56
It's my understanding their account was seized because they did not indicate that they were a "money exchange" business on their account application.  Considering that this was not a cut and dry question (even to the regulators) when their application was filled out, why be so judgmental?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:20:02
There is no question that their account was sized for lack or regulatory compliance.  That is not the question.  The question is what was the effect of that seizure on their business, and did it lead to a cascading effect that brought them to where they are today.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:16:35
Yes.  I just saw the [leaked document]( and it looks like the problems were a lot bigger than a few million dollars in an american account.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:22:07
How can loosing access to millions of dollars have no effect on your business?
@_date: 2012-09-29 01:34:42
4% is much more reasonable, and a premium on top of that is appropriate for person-to-person service.   Where do you tell potential clients to go if they don't have an e-wallet?
@_date: 2012-03-26 11:12:14
If you imagine this article is about gold, instead of bitcoins, all of his points are laughable when you consider gold (with all of it's flaws) has been money for thousands of years.
@_date: 2013-06-20 18:41:09
Is that technically possible?  If so, is someone working on it?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:25:52
No more than were incentivized to have the price go higher last week.  Probably a lot less.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:25:23
It has nothing to do with technicals or charts, just fear and greed.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:31:01
Of course it's a risk, but it's a lot smaller one than it was a few days ago.
@_date: 2013-07-02 11:24:13
Anyone who thinks the established powers that be will ever allow bitcoin any type of legitimacy (such as this ETF) simply doesn't know the history of money. This will never be allowed. Bitcoin has no potential outside the black market, but given the world economic situation, I expect the black market to have astronomical growth in the coming years. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:20:53
Now that is good point!
@_date: 2013-07-02 12:28:19
You make a good point, and perhaps they may look at this as an opportunity to manipulate the BTC price - just as they do for Silver and Gold.  However, I still think they would prefer to just avoid the necessity of that by continuing to demonize crypto-currency.
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:50:46
I used to be that kind of idealist, but not anymore.  Check this out:
@_date: 2013-05-31 15:47:11
Don't you think Big Money knows how to manipulate without being obvious?  Why can't they buy and sell just enough to dull enthusiasm? 
@_date: 2013-05-31 15:59:18
Not special, just open-minded.  They manipulate Interest Rates, Stock Markets, Bank Reserves, LIBOR and probably precious metals, why not Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:08:41
I think you're on the right track.  If you don't have long term confidence, you don't belong in the market.  Keep in mind however, when everyone has long term confidence, the prices will be a lot higher.
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:41:51
Markets aren't manipulated for profits alone.  The manipulation of precious metals in particular are Likely accomplished only by a significant loss in dollars, but the benefits of managing appearances outweigh that cost. This is especially true when you can just print as many dollars as you want, so "losses" are inconsequential. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:42:36
Yep.  My bad. I changed it..
@_date: 2013-04-19 11:03:11
I hope you take this moment for some self reflection. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:48:00
Yes, people who all make their living from the same tax revenue.  Bitcoin is  a threat to that revenue, and is therefore as much a threat to government as any foreign power, if not greater.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:41:08
No you can't.  Risk is inherent in such a small, relatively new, and relatively untested investment.  Sentiment can change at any time, and will change often.  Positive sentiment brings high prices, and negative sentiment brings low prices.  So if you believe in the long term, buying during periods of negative sentiment is ideal.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:55:18
All of the issues you point out were just as true on Monday as they are today.  The only thing that has changed is sentiment, so in a way, you made my point.
@_date: 2013-04-19 11:04:09
Fools huh?
@_date: 2013-04-19 11:13:34
Please keep your mouth shut in the future as you have now clearly been discredited. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 18:33:29
I don't understand. How could you have saved a btc?
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:21:04
I don't agree.  Governments may not use unlimited resources for typical regulation, but they will if they feel fundamentally threatened.  Bitcoin does threaten the very heart of their power base, so they could very well react in warlike fashion.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:30:27
Yes, my post will move the market.  Thats my plan.  Post on reditt --&gt; profit.
@_date: 2013-04-19 11:11:24
Yep, no fundamentals to Bitcoin. I guess that's why the price has now doubled since your brilliant insight. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:24:10
Why buy now?  At this point it feels to me like the emotional level of the panic on this board matches the emotional elation of last week.  Lag times are a symptom of both panics and irrational exuberance, and can be used as an indicator to buy or sell.
@_date: 2013-04-19 15:52:47
All of a sudden Mr. Nice guy wants to make deals.  What happened to "you have no idea what you're doing and you deserve every loss you're going to get"?  I made a simple observation about the potential upside of buying in a panic, and you jumped down my throat.  I don't need to make a deal to keep from looking ridiculous when you already do.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:29:27
The time to buy is exactly when things are the most crazy.  The saying on wall street is to 'buy when there is blood in the streets'.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:21:31
You shouldn't buy bitcoins at all if you can't handle price swings.  They're not going away anytime soon
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:17:30
Whatever.  I'm just noting my observation.  Take it or leave it.
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:56:31
They can do that already.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:54:32
This is so wrong.  Neither "smart money", institutional investors, or the general public have touched bitcoin in any meaningful way.  Not even the media attention has been that significant.
@_date: 2013-04-19 11:05:27
Yep, I had no clue what was happening, genius. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:45:26
No one knows where every penny goes.  Here's some programs that were eventually discovered, but who knows how many else are out there:
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:54:54
No way.  Governments will never be "swayed" to suicide.  Control of the currency is the foundation of all of their power.  It's how they make all of their promises and wars.  Take that away, and what are they good for?
I agree that adopting bitcoin could be enticing for a struggling developing economy, but that would be a major affront to the powers that be in the Western World, and a prelude to war.
@_date: 2013-04-19 11:01:54
How you like me now?
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:11:58
So you think gold is at it's "natural level" now?  I'm not so sure.  The price of gold is a highly visible measure of the market's confidence in the central bank's stewardship of the currency.  There is a lot of motivation on the side of the power's that be to maintain that sense of confidence.  As a result, I don't believe ongoing manipulation of the gold price is out of the realm of possibility.
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:41:25
I doubt it at this point, but if it gets more mainstream they would almost have to (at the very least).
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:12:48
This is hardly astronomical.  98% of the investing public doesn't even know what bitcoins are.
@_date: 2013-07-03 12:44:12
Of course the response is absolutely correct in all respects, however that doesn't really matter.  Laws exist to maintain the status quo, not to disrupt it.  Either a technicality will be found, or a new law will be fast tracked.  Bitcoin will never be allowed to go mainstream.  Any BTC related business should be done outside the US, no energy should be wasted trying to comply with regulations that will just change for the worse, anonymity should be strived for at all times, and decentralized exchange should be the top priority for the BTC community.
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:25:34
I think you underestimate the government's willingness to use brute force when subterfuge does not suffice.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:11:26
You're illustrating my point.  A pro bitcoin post would never receive this kind of negative reaction last week.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:20:09
Continued volatility of this type is not out of the question.  The whole of the stock market had TWO declines of greater than 50% since 2000, and that's a lot more stable than bitcoin.  Also, the historical volatility of microcap stocks are not at all analogous to the volatility of bitcoins, they're completely different animals.
@_date: 2013-06-20 20:42:27
Another approach: 
@_date: 2013-05-31 15:34:54
So you feel it is normal for a tiny, new, highly speculative, and potentially paradigm shifting technology existing in the middle of an unprecedented global upheaval of legacy systems to just muddle along in price for prolonged periods of time?  That doesn't feel right to me.
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:50:22
That's round one, but it won't work. The benefits of bitcoin are too enticing to eliminate it with propoganda and threats alone.  That doesn't even work for sharing movies.
@_date: 2013-06-20 19:41:26
How is buttercoin decentralized?  It's my understanding that they're just building a robust exchange, but that does nothing to make it distributed.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:32:54
There's no way to know how long a panic will last.  This could be the end or it could be the beginning, but we do know that people are Panicking, and we do know that panics do not last forever.  Hence, it's a pretty good time to buy.
@_date: 2013-04-19 11:01:12
Just a reminder that I posted this a $65/BTC
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:22:59
Really?  That would seem to be a huge barrier to growth if true.  I think you may be mistaken.
@_date: 2013-04-19 12:46:53
Oh please.  Your main thesis has been decimated and you're looking for a technicality rather than admitting you were totally caught up the panic and totally wrong.
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:49:48
If it's that easy to stop bitcoin adoption, it makes the grandiose price appreciation predictions a complete impossibility in my eyes. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:49:54
A rise in bitcoin is a clear and public vote of no confidence in fiat currencies. As a result there is sufficient motivation (well beyond simple profit) to suppress the price.  Besides, who needs profit when you can print as much  money as you want anyway?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:28:18
You guys are being ridiculous.  There is no way to know what will happen over such a short timeframe.  Either you believe bitcoin has long term potential and resolve yourself to ride the wave, or don't bother.  Trying to time this stuff is impossible, and usually just comes down to luck.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:41:57
Nerds are smart, and they have money, but they are not "smart money".  A handful of hedge funds is far from a mad rush of institutional investors.  As for the public, ask an adult on the street what a bitcoin is.  My bet is 8 out of 10 have no idea.
@_date: 2013-06-20 19:10:06
Wow.  The holy grail indeed.  This gets me excited for the future.  Do you think it will work?
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:16:03
It has a fundamental value as money.  Much like gold.  There's not much you can do with gold except look at it, but it is prized because it is rare, doesn't deteriorate, and is fairly easily divisible - which makes it perfect for use as money.
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:52:01
If that is the case, I think they would only hoard it with the idea to eventually dump it all back into the market in such a way as to cause a major crash.  With a sizable enough position, it could continue to be sold off over time until confidence in the currency is totally drained.  Basically a DoS attack as the main strategy in a war of attrition.
There is a case to be made that they already engage such tactics in the precious metals markets today.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:43:18
Best line ever:
