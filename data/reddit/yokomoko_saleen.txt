Fuck coinbase for preventing theft /w

They scrap plans to make bitcoin mining eliminated? What the fuck does that mean, OP?

Don't think asp.net is a programming language in its self is it? More a framework to develop web apps.

It's incredibly easy to fiddle the books with cash (just don't ring particular transactions through!), But when your books don't add up due to money going into the bank via card, eventually you are going to get caught.

Cash is easier for companies to 'fiddle the books'. In Scotland there are a few high profile CC provider companies that are just £15 per terminal per month. When companies ask for cash only I always lean towards them fiddling the books, or laundering money.
@_date: 2019-10-11 12:57:54
This is a place in Scotland. CC handling fees are miniscule in the UK typically.

It's from the TV show Chernobyl.
Not bad, not terrible. Famous words (now, not sure if they were ever actually spoken, and if they were, would have been in Russian I guess) before one of, if not the worst nuclear disasters in history.

Cringe. OP is cringe. Post is cringe.

Ironic considering btcpayserver uses Microsoft asp.net razer for the front end �� but yeah this is the solution.

Use btcpay instead. Same API as Bitpay but open source and can run/host your own version yourself. 
No reason anyone should support Bitpay. None. Nada.

Well.. did it work? Little candle lol

so what you are saying is... You are expecting adoption to be above our expectations soon. If that's what you're expecting, isn't it a self-unfulfilling prophecy?

The sells look fine based on what I can see. About market price. The buys are £90 more.
@_date: 2019-02-15 17:15:47
I have not. Didn't want to sell any and not buying at that price when coinbase is a bank transfer away.

Bitcoin AIM. These forks are getting ridiculous

Last time I checked BTCPay has an identical API to Bitpay (by design). I guess OP isn't taking into consideration everything else.
Would imagine they would want to host their own BTCPay server - again, not a tricky task in its self but then getting up all the security and backup systems etc.
They may want to redesign the BTCPay Server front-end so it is more themed around them (like LTCPay, GRSPay etc. Have done). 
Like you said, consolidating existing payments from Bitpay, taxes, etc. Will most likely be easier whilst they are still using it.
The bigger the company, the more 'red tape' there is.

Apologies. SEPA is just an international transfer. So for Coinbase, a SEPA transaction would be sending your GBP to an international version of an account number and they'll receive EUR. I know Halifax charge a good £9 for the pleasure...
Fire Personal is an international bank account with 0 fees for SEPA, although I've never used it before, a lot of people on the crypto subreddits have and recommend its use. You can transfer funds to Fire Personal with 0 fees, then transfer that money to Coinbase. And visa versa for withdrawing.
Hope this helps - I'm relatively new to the space too.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:08:25
I used Coinbase - Quite high fees but not many other places with lower in the UI. But don't do SEPA unless you use Fire Personal. You can add a debit card relatively easily. Unfortunately, the withdrawal process is trickier, again I think Fire Personal is the best way for that too.

Other than the miners, of course, who can decide whether you are allowed to move that value or not :)
