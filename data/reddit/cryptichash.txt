Yeah it’s like one of those bars that has a lock box behind the bar for your credit card but you have the key to open it and if you run the bartender has a hammer but if he tries to use the hammer before you run you have a gun but he has a bozooka but you have nukes and then he has a bigger button and then bitcoin Cold War.

I sent it from an exchange.  I don’t trust software wallets and Inwas hoping to get a real wallet.  My guess is the exchange probably has it on a corn job and that fired litterally 1 minute after the window expired.  So I guess I have to blame the exchange but how the fuck do I get a better wallet if Incant get to them on time with what I have.  I’m really frustrated with this and Inpaid extra for fast shipping.  They only refund 70% back..

I appreciate the response Im just a little lost here.  If you know the public key to generate the the vanity key pair, why can't you spend it?  The privkeypart is the key used to spend right?

Likely this is what happened.  But this feels like a chicken before the egg thing.  I'm trying to get a better wallet..
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:33:53
So in other words, damned if you do and damned if you don't.  Satoshis million btc is only  &lt; 5% the max circulating supply so I can't imagine it will affect the price that much or at least it will only be a temporary fear of a large influx of coins on the market.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:04:57
Now that I think about it, the solution seams obvious. Think from satoshis perspective, they didnt do this for money or else those coins would have been moved.  Maybe they deliberately lost the keys.  Either way, what is better, satoshi moving his/their coins or someone stealing it with a qc?
I think the softfork is actually the best thing.  Hear me out, if this satoshi was smart enough ( rhetorical ) they would have had the wherewithal to purchase and hold many thousands of btc when it was just pennies under an entirely different pseudonym or even their real name for that matter because who would know.
Satoshi is either no longer with us or he's living it up nice and rich and we all just assume those first coins are the ones he cares about.  He likely has thousands of different address so he doesn't stand out.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:35:52
You know, I know all about the delays I just never had an issue with network propagation speed like that.  It’s a $30 lesson to check confirmation times before sending a transaction.  This isn’t going to end well when more technically illiterate folks start to use this for its intended purpose.  Or anyone who wants to use it with any hope of brevity,  And I’m waiting like everyone else for LN.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:11:27
Oh, it wasn't even about block confirmations.  The transaction was heavily delayed for some reason. It was just a minute or so late.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:52
Wow..  unbelievably generous.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:47:10
Sure, the device itself has limited space.  But they use that 24 word seed across all the wallets.  The generation of address's is deterministic and you are using the same seed each time.  Even if you delete one, when you reinstall it - its able to generate your original keys / address's again.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:12:50
As soon as someone uses the word privilege I just stop listening.  I've been told numerous times that I am privileged simply because of the color of my skin and that I'm male for some reason..  My original statement holds true.  Bigotry goes both ways.
College campuses these days are pretty toxic.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:12:29
Paying the difference in a transaction is your idea of bending over backwards?  Now, a paying customer is returned 30% less what they paid with an 'oh well' from staff.  If this is your idea of customer service then buyer beware.  This company does not know how to help customer's during exceptional situations.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:54:51
Mastering Bitcoin is a good technical book on all things bitcoin / blockchain.  You can find some information freely on the internet too, or if your question is specific to how ledgers hardware wallets work, their website has some good info on the technical aspects.  Trevor’s website as well.

I guess I’ll wait until the amount they sent me back is enough to buy another one.

They took way more than the miner fee.  About 10x
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:51:53
It was a 15 minute timer, they received it a minute after it was up and by that time btc had appreciated- so my new invoice was for more than what I sent 10 minutes earlier.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:35:44
The amount they received after all fees was in excess of what they were asking.

Right but if bitcoin is updated and hard forked, can we not hardcode a new quantum resistant tx type for those older addresses?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:00:41
Absolutely.  Every transaction you make should use a new address as well.  They likely use extended public keys.  Whereby you can generate public keys ( child keys )  from some parent public key without having to know the corresponding private key.  And you can create basically trees of address's.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:52:59
They still chose and continue to use a payment processor who is ripping off customers.

The first words in the bitcoin whitepaper imply, at least to me, that this is a currency.  You cannot have a currency without some store of value.  Neither of us are wrong.

The seed is what’s used to generate your addresses.  Each time you make a transaction you have new addresses etc.  The device has limited memory for such things but can regenerate them at a later date If you use the same seed
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:04:26
Hmm, TIL.  Thanks.  But just so I have this right - you still have to expose the public key?  Normally both the private key and public key are hidden, or did you mean the public address?
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:44:27
Bigotry: intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself.
I’ll just leave this here, no matter which side you’re on.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:59:41
I'll probably have to study cryptography a little closer, I just dont understand how the public key can be used to generate something private by a 3rd party.  Ill definitely look into that now but I want to thank you for taking the time to explain that!

It seems after one google search, I’m not the only one:
By the time it updated a price I under paid by a few pennies.  If you represent this company you need to please reconsider how this works.  I could have sent the difference.  Instead they sent me back 70% of what I paid.  You really see this as acceptable to treat your customers this way?

I'm the child of immigrants who came to this country with nothing and still have very little.  Living in the melting pot, among every minority you can imagine.  Nobody has ever given us anything and or helped us because of our 'skin'.  The privilege you speak of belongs to those with money, not pigment count.  To say I benefited in the slightest, would be to discredit the countless sacrifices my family and I have made for whatever little slice of success we now have.  I look around me at people who can't afford it, wearing expensive name brand clothing etc..  While I sit to myself reading, studying, trying to be successful.  Nope.

Nothing stupid about it.  You cannot expect different exchanges to match every trade 1:1.  In which case there will always be differences.  Arbitrage is a thing and in such cases is profitable until prices reach an equilibrium - given all costs associated with transactions.

At least allow me to send the difference.  Instead of taking 30% and sending back the rest.

It never needs to reconnect - it could detect seed gen software and modify.  Or Intercept data sent to the printer and modify.
But yeah, if you reconnect you just made it that much easier.
@_date: 2018-08-25 12:19:58


Ok, well then you should know:


Satoshi didn't invent PoW.  He references this document in the original whitepaper: 


Nope, the data is not random at all.  It's the merkle root, previous hash, etc of the CURRENT BLOCK BEING MINED. The random data you might be talking about is the nonce incremented on each hash attempt.


That's one particular type of fork called a hard fork.

@_date: 2018-06-07 14:06:06
I'm not mistaking anything.  You're likely describing the Finney Attack or an Alternative History attack.  In either case,  you need to be mining your own blocks.
Edit: Or colluding with a miner..
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:25:55
Only if the double spent tx is mined into a block before the valid tx which is highly unlikely unless you're trying to mine your own blocks.  And, unless you owned over 50% of the hashing power of the network, you would simply be harming your own mining revenues to the benefit of everyone else.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:47:02
Oh you're talking about the instance where a merchant immediately delivers goods without waiting for even a single confirmation.
You're relying on the merchants trust or ignorance, not a weakness in the protocol.

That's not a successful double spend unless the merchant instantly delivered the goods.

There, there, their 'they're' was wrong there.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:22:55
No, op asked if they had to wait for 10 mins in the merchants store.  My suggestion would be yes, for as long as the merchant needs to feel confident in the tx.

Honestly, you’re missing information here that would really illuminate how secure your seeds are,  Namely, where did you generate these seeds?  Where as in, both was the computer air gapped and clean installed, and did you use a trusted generator.  You should be generating your seeds on a computer that never has and never will touch the internet.  encrypt the file there - don’t type the seeds ( keylogger ) or view the seeds ( screen capture ) back in on an internet connected device - it’s easy to steal otherwise.
