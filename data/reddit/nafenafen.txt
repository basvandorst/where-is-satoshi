If my everything was destroyed, but I was able to get a smart phone with LTE I'm solid.
Or I keep my wallet.dat on a USB stick and never let go of it. 5 years later things quiet down and Im able to get ahold of a computer with internet.
My nation's economy has collapsed but I spin up my pc and bam there's my wallet. Then buy shit off newegg and overstock.

Exactly. People who "invest" in bitcoin are full of shit. I have friends who speculate on crypto and they've made good money. Good for them. But they're adding to the problem and out of principle I don't want to get involved.
I mine on free electricity, I trade here and there, but by no means am I investing nor am I gung ho about this recent growth. I enjoy participating in this crypto experiment but it's still in the infantile stages. There will be growing pains. 
Don't trust exchanges. Go into exchanges assuming they're all ponzis. Ride the wave if you want. It can be fun and you'll learn about trading. I mean shit, as a hobby miner I've learned things that look great on my resume (I'm a programmer). But the wave will crash. 
I've always said that if you want to properly invest in bitcoin, offer goods or services and accept bitcoin as payment. However, this is where the "pyramid" scheme comparison comes into play because I'm saying shit like "invite your friends! You'll make good money!" but the reality is, it won't be legal tender. The only way to truly add value to the crypto marketplace is through liquidity.

I would say buy more. Depends on the reason why though. If major world War started, I'd say crypto is a good investment.

Np. And again, do your own due diligence. I have a friend who put 50k into a diverse crypto portfolio at the beginning of this year and he's cashed out big time. My portfolio is around 2k at current prices and that's just from mining and limited trading. I'm not saying stay out. It's a privilege to be an early adopter in all of this.

War is expensive. World War is expensive and devastating. I see a couple of possibilities:
A. Governments will print money causing inflation rendering the currency worthless. You see this happening in Venezuela where the belief is that crypto will take over as primary currency.
B. Governments will take on too much debt and default rendering fiat worthless.
C. Governments increase taxes / imports decrease. Nations exit the global market and imports become too expensive due to legislation. Black market fueled by crypto will flourish because nobody wants to deal with taxes.
D. Devastation and destruction cause paper money to be meaningless. But anyone with a computer can still be connected to the global market.
The way I see it, if Visa's headquarters in California gets nuked by north Korea crypto will skyrocket. Not that I think that's going to happen. But online transactions are backed by monolithic organizations. If one goes kaput then everyone who depends on it suffers. Crypto is backed by a globalized, decentralized network. The global p2p aspect of it has already been proven useful and useable with the dark net.
But what do I know

Margin accounts in tether? I'm an exchange. I give you 100 magic beads and say you can buy bitcoin with them. I promise you that when you sell ill give you a dollar per bead. I give my 1 million users 100 beads each to use. My exchange has a float of $1 million. I have a line of credit with a bank. I make a few million off transaction fees. I fuck around with some of my profits. Everyone decides to sell btc and cash out. I go to the bank and try to cover. The bank tells me to fuck off and closes my account. The bank goes to other banks and tells them what happened. Suddenly banks don't want anything to do with exchanges. Exchanges everywhere fail. The end.
Are you confusing ponzi and pyramid scheme?
Don't get me wrong I have a diversified crypto portfolio, but it'd be a dangerous game to just blindly throw a shit ton of money at it.

it's not some dude, it's a bunch of contracted consultants. Coinbase engineers probably do not have the expertise to develop apps on the mobile platform so they contracted the work out. the hell is the big deal?
@_date: 2014-06-20 19:32:34
how do you know that the 3rd party working with Coinbase did not sign a similar contract?

because your moral authority is the correct one...people like you miss the purpose of bitcoin in the first place.
