I agree. I'm really in this for the long haul anyway, but it's fun to buy on a 10% drop then see a 10%+ increase an hour later. I'm 0.2 BTC away from being a proud owner of a full BTC so I'm going to keep having fun putting small amounts in to reach that milestone during the drops.

I excitedly opened this test and started to fill out some questions then thought to myself, "this is crazy, I've got no experience with sales and currently work in cardiac rehab". Is doing well on the test really the main prerequisite? I think I really should have just filled everything out, but it felt so implausible. I've been sold ever since Coinbase was featured in Wired, which is what prompted me to create a wallet with you guys. Can't wait till all my bills are set up for bitcoin autopay. I have a feeling that will be sooner rather than later.

Fair point, had small amount of bitcoin sitting in Coinbase and wanted to grab some IOTA. I sent the coin before I really realized the charge. Next time I’ll go from gdax.

Thanks yeah I got ahead of myself and sent straight from Coinbase without thinking, should’ve put it back over to gdax first.
