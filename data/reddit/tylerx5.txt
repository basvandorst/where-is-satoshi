to an extent, but food and water have value regardless of faith

If someone is forcing you to treat something as valuable that does not make it have inherent value. Inherent value exists without external influences {food, water, medicine, or any basic need to live}


I don't believe my statement contradicts this


For the majority of our country's history our money was directly tied to the value of gold, And everyone was legally entitled to get gold in exchange for paper money. It wasn't until the creation of the Federal Reserve under the Woodrow Wilson administration that we started to see currency's value tied more to what the government says it was worth

all based on faith of its value

In the end all currency is still based on faith. Regardless of government regulation if people didn't believe currency was worth anything they wouldn't use it

My bad, I got that mixed up with article 10 where it says states can't make stuff other than gold or silver.
