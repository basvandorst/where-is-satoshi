For some reason many people here don't like BitPay (perhaps because they're looking to accept BCH soon) 
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:44:18
This is key IMO. If core had it in their GUI, then a lot more transactions will be SegWit by default and therefore vastly lowering fees.
It still doesn't make much sense to me why the exchanges are waiting for that, they can use their own software / CLI !
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:54:41
Bitcoin (as well as another coin that has a similar name) is meant to be both a store of value and a digital currency.
"A peer-to-peer electronic cash"
Bitcoin was the first crypto**currency**, so it should have the ability to buy multiple different values of items. I believe it will at some point again, but it will take time.
Also, they're currently working on SegWit &amp; Lightning to lower fees and make it worth it to use as a cryptocurrency for smaller transactions
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:46:17

I got one of these emails the other day.
They claimed to be a darknet user, willard35 and asked for $817 in Bitcoin and provided an address.
They probably got email addresses and passwords from Onliner Spambot or Exploit.in accounts, then did a crappy mail merge saying you watched some weird porn shit with your supposed password too - it was actually wrong in my case but I guess it might have been right for others.
Also, check  to see if your emails have been compromised etc

I think so, I sent some bitcoin to a bitcoin address and it asked me if it was BTC or BCH and the address started with the same characters so I am guessing it is possible.

It may "technically" make you $1000 a month but only if you got your hands on right now and if no-one else did also.
The profitability will rapidly decrease as other users add their ASICs to the network (probably at the same time as you). In fact it already has, compare the month and the (days * 30)
It does seem like the ASIC is legitimate though

Coinbase actually allows you to use it as a minor, you just need a parent to sign an online document + parents ID + your ID.

I don't think there is a difference between address but AFAIK you can only use one at a time. I just use Coinomi because it's simple and I can use both with different addresses.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:15:53
I tried with both, I don't think they use the same format. It's not a HD wallet as far as I know. It just contains a file that has all of the private keys in it, but it's encrypted with aes256cbc and I believe in a format called protobuf.

Yeah, I discovered that a while back. I'm used to using Coinpayments but there was one site that required Bitpay.
I was so confused because there was no proper address and the QR code doesn't scan in anything other than Coinbase. Luckily DeBitPay exists otherwise I wouldn't have been able to make the purchase.

A lot of users change their profile name frequently so Twitter would have to set up a manual filter for certain people. If I'm correct, they just implemented/are implementing this for Elon Musk and a few others.

Hmm, you're asking in People who have it likely buy it to get it rather than mine (I'm sure there are some miners here though, just not many)

Contact coinpayments.net to see if they can help
@_date: 2018-07-27 17:44:20
They hack a verified account. They don't change the username as that will get rid of the verified tick.
Edit: many people are confused as to how Twitter usernames/profile names work - which is understandable as it is quite different to many other systems.
Both the username and profile name are changeable. The username in the picture shown in OP is shown to be ** on the right. This is the one where if you change it, the verified tick will be removed.
If you change the profile name however, the tick remains the same as your username hasn't changed. In this case the hacked/bought account was ** and the scammers kept this username and changed the Profile Name to **Dọnald J. Trump** and changed the image to Donald Trump's image. Changing these do not affect Verified status.
The reason of the dot underneath the o, is probably to prevent it automatically getting recognised as a fake/spam account by Twitter as even this small change can make a big difference as the ọ is a part of a non Western alphabet.
@_date: 2018-07-28 00:41:25
That almost happened to me. They didn't suspend but after everything I did (even like a tweet) it would ask me to complete a captcha every goddamn time.

Went to Zurich for holiday, saw a bottle of softdrink is 4 CHF at duty-free. Expected this to be normal pricing and walked out of the airport to the other side where the shops are to find the same drinks for 1.30 CHF.
Honestly, in my experience it was less expensive than I thought but I thought it would've been crazy high going on what everyone else was saying.
