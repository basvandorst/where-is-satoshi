I have more of that than I do Bitcoin. I don't believe in it as much as an investor, however. I have a bunch of different coins for different reasons.

Bitcoin doesn't have a monopoly on decentralization. There are decentralized alts that you can spend. If the world must have a Bitcoin, though, I think BCH has the upper hand. That's not how I would have written the story. I'm just reading the writing on the wall.

If you can't see how someone might legitimately want Bitcoin to be a fast network and spendable currency, and disappointed with the way BTC has evolved, I think you're just creating cartoon villains in your mind. Sure, Roger has greed but he also wants to be the head of a useful global currency with real utility for real people. We all want that currency to exist. As for him coopting the brand and CB participating in an attack, in the real world brands do what it takes to dominate. Is every aspect of it ethical? No. Is it realistic to expect that every power player is going to act ethically? No. Bitcoin loves deregulation when it acts in its favor, but wants regulation when CB might have participated in insider trading. Can't have it both ways. As for me, I'm choosing to step out of the Bitcoin wars and go with what works in the real world, rather than trying to make the world conform to my preconceived notions. Until Bitcoin has fundamentals that befit its valuation, I can't tell the entire market to "wait wait Lightening is totally coming!" People need something to spend.

Also, I think the market just wants Bitcoin, even if it's Bitcoin in name only. Litecoin doesn't have the spark among the general populace. There are so many more people outside the market coming in than there are current market participants. My cousin Gary doesn't give a shit about the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. He just wants the one that's cheaper/that works better/that's going to go up in value the most. BCH has an easier narrative this way. Litecoin can't lay claim to that kind of attention.

In that case we should all abandon Bitcoin for the alts anyway because Chinese miners. Bitcoin does beat Bitcoin Cash in this regard, but that's not saying an awful lot. If BCH is corrupt for that reason so is BTC.

Different coins, different reasons. Litecoin spending, some growth. BCH growth and future spending.

With you. My heart rate is normal and I sleep just fine. My portfolio is the same as it was a week ago. Some of the hysteria is obviously people who feel Bitcoin is being usurped, but much of it is people freaking out because they're risking too much.

Bitcoin miners use ASIC Boost too. I don't see how you could expect miners to pass it up out of the goodness of their hearts. Sure BCH miners use ASIC Boost, but the fork would have happened with or without it.
