Yeah, they put those at the odds. These were extraordinary circumstances, just like someone getting impeached would be. It took immense voter suppression, half the country not to vote and the intelligence community releasing 'fake news' a week before the election to swing it. It's not a logical argument to say that because Trump won contrary to the odds, oddsmakers can't figure he will get impeached.

I mean Hillary won the popular vote so what kind of argument is that? It's not like they were insanely off. There was also comeys letter and classic American apathy/ignorance that came into effect

I think this post in general sums up a major concern I have. While I think BTC serves a role long term, it's more than plausible that it simply doesn't

What swamp? America is the swamp now. We drain what we have, and there's nothing left but a lot of bruised nerves and uneducated disaffected citizens with no earning power.

In denial? A system designed to appease the south so they could keep their slaves happened to elect a Republican president? I'm not confused about that. If the system followed the popular vote and didn't inherently suppress minorities, Americans have a democratic president since 1992. Needless to say 2000 election was stolen, started a war to keep it, and the 2016 election needed Russian interference and wikileaks to lose by 3 million votes. Good stuff.

Sure. All true. It's about fucking time those of us with a clue start doing something. If all these demagogues can do it in the name of hate, for fucks sake so can we in the name of what is right

My feelings aren't "hurt", I'll take your apology on behalf of the shame he has brought to the office of the president though

Trump got millions from his dad and drastically under performed what he would have made putting his money into a generic fund over the same period. Do you think that fucking cuckservative could create bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-05 19:05:29
Both of those statements are true. Things can seem contradictory but be true. For example, Donald Trump is unfit for office, and yet he is in office.

God given right? Sorry no. It would be given by man at best and only if you secure it for yourselves.
