It will be open source. And you will be able to set up multiple merchants if that's what you mean by "multi-shop capable".

The link worked for me.

Detroit is a good bet.

Yes, you can pick the initial amount; remember though that the merchant can always claim they never received the "seed money"; so consider carefully as to who you establish this type of agreement with. That is, you have to trust the merchant.

Merchants can install more than one wallet; they work independently of each other. But you bring up a good point, the promoter will need to have the ability to resync a merchant's account in the case the merchant were to lose their phone or other mobile device or provide some other means to back up the merchant's *thisApp.

I will answer these questions in reverse order:
The real risk regarding exchange rate volatility falls to the promoter (i.e., the promoter, the person giving the merchant $50 in fiat is at the whim of the exchange rate locked in at the moment of the transaction between the merchant and the bitcoin paying customer)
If the store owner (a.k.a. merchant) never makes $50 in bitcoin sales, then the promoter always has the option to go and buy $50 in products or services from the merchant with bitcoin himself; therefore closing out the debt.
As far as "how it works", I would say that *thisApp is using the blockchain as a means to store and track an account balance. Thus giving the merchant some experience with doing bitcoin transactions without actually holding bitcoin.
