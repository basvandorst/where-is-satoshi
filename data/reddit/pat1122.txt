Sounds like Becky is a perfect candidate for the ole 'turn the mouse off and watch the meltdown'. I used to just switch the mouse off when people like that pissed me off, its funny to watch an adult meltdown when they cant find their cursor on the screen haha :)

Ya but that’s nature of the beast, investing if mostly about the ‘what if’s’ and ‘I should have’. I just stink to the golden rule of not investing more than I can afford to lose.

I’m never selling nothingggggg. 
Story of my life, awesome content!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:43:13
Try opening your app, any time there is large movement such as today their service is down due to high volumes of traffic. Tens of thousands of people are virtually locked out and unable to complete their trade - it has an affect on the prices as we are seeing now, jumps/dips of 500$ in the matter of seconds.
If you wanted to sell or buy on Coinbase during this time you couldn’t and just need to wait for it to come back online, at that point it’s probably dropped thousands - this is also happened last week between 10-12k. Very sad actually 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:53:04
Speed up transactions by implementing segwit? Nah, we’ll just improve I.d verification which should be simple considering you’re giving them a picture or your license and SSN. 
I heard the word litecoin once...

Fuck this is awesome man, congrats to you guys!
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:32:02

The main thing for me is that there is a ‘limited’ supply which I see value in. I’m not sure of my mileage but I hate having debt (mortgage/cars). We’ll see what happens if I ever have enough to wipe those clean.

There was a Buy for 180 bitcoin right before the break. Possibly. Now fkn Coinbase is fucked and Gdax is lagging like a bitch 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:50:40
Coinbase is down, can’t buy or sell even if you wanted to
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:22:03
Yeah soooo ugh, haven’t checked the prices in about a week and now seeing 20% drops. Any info out there as to why? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:05
Yep 19500, didn’t see it any higher per Gdax. I can’t access any of my shit though, crazy crazy day!

@_date: 2018-08-29 02:11:16
Yes same, I loved that shit! My favorite was when you would receive that random rainbow paint brush and sell it on the auction for a ridiculous amount. I enjoyed it because you could buy and sell things for a profit. I wasn’t into the mini games and shit to be honest. I sifted through the auction site for bargains or Miss-priced items, done a fuck ton of trading on the stock market and adopted any pet that had a rainbow paint brush already applied and generally made money off of it. Now that I look back, how sad lol it’s all virtual numbers 
@_date: 2018-08-27 02:38:27

Finally, someone with a fucking brain! Buying at the peak before a correction or crash blows but correcting it is crucial. Of course if you went all in on that one time trade right before the peak then you’re fucked and this is the wrong game for you but for the love of god people DCA is what matters.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:25:17

@_date: 2019-06-28 20:38:33
Reminds me of the story they did in Sydney, there was this one dude in the city, same spot for the same amount of hours everyday rain or shine. They ended up doing a story on him, he used to be a banker and one day quit his job, turned out he was making 6 figures sitting on the ground begging for money so he just never stopped. Tax free too.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:19:16
Costco has been like that for years! You sir need to use my simple trick of cutting the long ass lines.
Step 1 - grab your single item or two
Step 2 - go to the desk by the door that signs up new members, credit cards etc
Step 3 - explain to the associate that you forgot your card
Step 4 - they’ll give you a temp paper card and check you out
Step 5 - get your hot dog and high tail it out of there
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:14:24

Fuck this is so true and would explain the rally this morning (US time). 
Could this be the reason why? 
Congrats homie, you get your 10k soon - hopefully! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:22:38
Exactly, I normally don’t rush to buy when I make my decision, I’ll watch and re-evaluate applying this same methodology. I’m ok buying a few bucks higher as it reassures my decision. Taken a long time to learn that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:32:18
Ohhh ok then haha, all good, you missed out on ~170 bucks. Jump back on the horse and hodl this time

@_date: 2017-11-27 01:21:11
Happened to me today too, they wanted me to verify my identity before I could purchase. Wondering why they didn’t ask that before my multiple purchases since signing up. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:08:20
Man if you are debt free and have coins left over that you technically obtained for ‘free’ then I would just hold onto them. Might take a dip here soon or it may not, only time will tell. Either way, even if it does take a dip I’m sure you will sell between 5-7k meaning you still have at least 20k. 
I think you should just start your career, focus on that and let you coins do their thing though. Congrats and all the best! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:48:36
I get what your saying, don’t know what kind of debt you are looking at but I factor in monthly repayments + interest. Again, everyone’s situation is different but maybe you can take 30% out of your cryptos and pay down debt. For those who got in late (like myself) I will never become a millionaire of this unless it reaches half a million lol I will however be able to pay off my car, throw a little towards my mortgage and put money away for my sons college. If I can do that then I am beyond happy. I will always have money stored in crypto’s that I will consider a long term saving amount - reason for that is I can’t keep looking at these prices and Reddit forever, it is so damn addicting lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:08:53
At least half! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:06:42
I bought in at 5900 - Coinbase hasn’t even processed my order yet so my hands are tied. Whatever happens happens, as long as it doesn’t drop below 5900 I’m happy. Been a crazy ride!

Sorry for your loss mate, losing a grandparent is rough but at 92, you and your family can safely say he lived a full/loving life and that’s the main thing.

Agreed, most people would of heard ‘it can be worth 10x the amount by this time next year’ and would of made their decision. I think he highlighted a risk, however, most people with some sort of sense realize there’s risk with any investment. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:03:46
I don’t listen to people who don’t know the difference between there, their and they’re. He confirmed my long time rule when he said ‘whenever’
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:22:02
I think everyone is going to be different based on how the money would be spent. If you can pay off debt, student loans, cars etc etc then I would cash out. If it’s just going to sit in your savings account then keep on hodling. I would gladly jump at the opportunity to pay off any debt I had if sitting on a large amount of coins
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:10:42
This article is a load of shit.

This deserves a million upvotes 
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:28:07
Was it your first transaction? I’m not sure which crypto you bought but it can take 5-8 days for the coin to come through, however, it should say ‘you bought 4 bitcoin @ xxxx, expected arrival 11/25’ maybe because you bought such a large amount it takes longer? I’m not sure, only do transactions under $1000
I love Coinbase for the fact that it’s extremely user friendly and helps noobs like myself get into. Now that I understand a bit more I am making the switch the gdax.
I hope it works out for you, I really really hope you get your money or at least the coin transaction works.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:38:05

Dude, I need to be honest, you are a smart fucker. I don’t know what kind of career you are in or working towards but it should definitely have some sort of trading in it.

@_date: 2017-11-22 04:03:23
That’s an awesome story dude, thanks for sharing. My folk have always been the ones who say, ‘don’t go out, save your money, buy a house’. 
That was until this week when I convince my dad to buy a little bitcoin and see what happens. He’ll definitely be a hodler but I’m glad I was able to change his mind and convince him.
The other comments are spot on though, it’s a generation gap and it’s all they’ve known since they have been able to put money away. 4-5% has always been a great return, anything higher is too risky or bullshit. Times are changing though and to the Moon we go
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:27:34
Awesome! Thanks for the recap, cool story line. I agreed with how they keep stories relevant. I feel the same about the Simpsons, although sometimes their episodes bore me; still relevant though.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:36:37
You’re right, if you look at the graph you can see that June -August is almost identical to August - October. The October to December is somewhat similar with the large spike in the beginning of the quarter. If it follows suit a dip is coming up here shortly. However, we all know anything can happen and at the end of the day we’re all just gambling.
Making millions is long gone for me, can’t invest enough capital to get that sort of return until it goes 10-20fold from here. Alt coins may be the wave of the future but anything any of us do is just rolling the dice and hoping for the best

I’m a newbie since June of last year, this time last year was amazing but needless to say this year has been pretty bleak. I’m also buying with the mindset that I’m lowering my averages/entry price, so much so that I’ve managed to average prices before my very first buy. 
I have one observation that I’ve made over the last 12 months, I’ve mentioned it once or twice on here before and got absolutely murdered but haven’t directly asked someone in the game as long as you have. I’ve observed that the stock market (Dow Jones for example) when that market fluctuates and we see massive swings in that price we see a similar trend with bitcoin and crypto in general.
I’m sure I’ll get down voted but wanted to get your thoughts.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:19:37

depends if your exchange are required to provide 1099's, you may see that your exchange could be asked by the IRS in the next few years and it may come back to bite you. its a risk though, just like cryptos in general. good luck homie!

could be wrong and could be solved by a simple good search but do capital gain amounts varied dependent on length of initial investment?
believe I read on here during Nov/Dec that people were holding on for at least another 12 months to lessen the % of tax on their gains. 
am I thinking correctly or will the % be calculated on the bracket for your income in that year?
thank you

A lot of companies still do Christmas bonuses, normally non commission staff. I used to do general admin and the company I was working for gave a bonus every 6 months. June and December, the called the December one out Christmas bonus, typically paid on the 15th.

I have fond memories of coinbase crashing multiple times a day/week for most of December and into January, saved my ass a few times to be honest. It’s just part of the cycle

Who knows but early 2013 Bitcoin was in the teens and by early November it hit over 1k, then slowly came down to the 200’s over the next 6 months. 
On the date he posted it was in the $600’s so believe he was pissed because of the $400 swing from a few weeks back hoping it was on the way back up. 
I wonder what happened to him, there was a number of years in between that bull run until the next. I hope he hodled on and made out big time last December.
