The selling of alts recently will most likely leave BTC and come back to alts but for 'growth' to come BTC market needs to grow first unless you expect BTC to dip.

Juuuust here! Next to the part about giving your soul, but just don't bother reading that.

Are alt coins safe on exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:52:59
Surfer is you right now when bitcoin dips
Unicorn is you when bitcoin rockets and there's no blood pressure going to your head
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:48:05

dead coin
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:50:43
What, can you explain?
EDIT: I think I understand what you're saying. I'm going to scam people via recovering their account? Please do not offer without making sure your accounts is authenticated along with security questions set. Thank you.
EDIT: Im also not buying or selling accounts. I'm just trading my items via a steam trade or gift process ( for untradeables) and insist on continue playing my beloved Dota 2 which I have 4k games on....

Nope august 1st first 
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:53:10
No it's saying if you invest now you will be the people that own bit coin. If you don't invest you will be the people that own a fraction because the price will be so high
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:24:57
Do you just get pissed or do you explain to them that we're trying to "fix" bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-13 00:10:27
So all the panic selling has settled and we will most likely see growth up until and after august 1st?
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:27:00
What an utter waste of time. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:57:28
