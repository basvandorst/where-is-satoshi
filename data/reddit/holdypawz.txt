At the current trajectory, when is the block reward expected to halve? And how much earlier is that than initially anticipated?

I think the best you can do in 7 minutes is to highlight the many advantages of bitcoin with real world examples and give them solid resources to learn more on their own time. You could also send them all a little bitcoin after the session. I don't think anything accelerates learning about bitcoin more than owning some bitcoin.

Once someone is informed, it's hard not to see bitcoin's potential. I'd say Paul Krugman is close.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:11:51
If people are holding hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stolen Gox coins, they're probably shitting themselves right now and might want an easy way out.

I know, but the analogy also implies that Bitcoin will be easily killed.

I'd like a service that alerts me when activity happens on a bitcoin address I'm "watching."

It's not devaluing anything, it's standardizing on a smaller denomination. I think it would actually increase the value of bitcoin because there would be less of a mental block to buy in.

Uh no. I didn't say anything like what you said. Thanks for twisting my words though.

This is a good read. Don't let the title dissuade you.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:48:24
But this isn't about you. It's about being easy for new adopters. I have a co-worker who thinks Bitcoin would never work as a currency because there will be a "berkshire hathaway situation" where every Bitcoin is too expensive for anyone too afford. I think we should make it clear that bitcoin is affordable by standardizing on numbers that are easy to understand.

@_date: 2014-03-25 15:19:28
Yes, but I think we need a very simple site for this specific purpose. People would just submit a bitcoin address and maybe a custom message.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:30:48
Thanks for your contribution 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:16:22
I would suggest cooperation with Gox to get the user's addresses and distribute in proportion to their balances.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:50:23
Of course not, but this is very high profile and it will be seriously investigated. I can't believe I have to say this.
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:18:17
That makes sense. I also see the potential which is why I plan to treat it like an investment and eventually spend them.

They're going to be hunted and they won't be able to move the coins without paranoia given the amount of attention on this. There is no harm in giving them an easy way out. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 13:35:26
This isn't true. Millions of dollars worth are mined every day.

I think everyone will have a different opinion on this, but here's what I would do. I'd travel with a small laptop and keep a copy of my main bitcoin wallet there (personally I would use a macbook air and Electrum). There would be password protection at login and on the wallet. Coins could be sent to the wallet on the phone as needed for selling to people from localbitcoins.com.
I'd also keep a password protected backup of the main wallet with a trusted person back home. If the laptop was ever lost or stolen, I'd have that person immediately send the coins to a new wallet for me.

It's difficult to for most journalists to cover bitcoins because it requires a decent understanding of technology and economics to get right. We need the *right* breed of journalist who can at least understand the bitcoin Wikipedia page.
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:14:43
This thread might be relevant to you: 
Also (excuse me of you're aware of this already), once you buy the coins, you can easily send them to any other wallet or exchange and cash out there.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:40:00
The best way to is to send them each a small amount of bitcoin

Eric Schmidt was interviewed on KQED Forum in May 2013. I emailed in a question about Bitcoin and it was answered on the air. I asked if he thought Google would ever integrate Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency in their products. He basically dodged the question.
Here is the audio of the interview. My question is just after the 43 minute mark.
edit: "On the general subject of bitcoin which has been in the news today, I would offer you the following. Do a Google search and look up 'volitility of Bitcoin', and then decide how you want to behave." -Eric Schmitt

Retailers save a lot of money in transaction fees when accepting bitcoin over credit cards. The author fails to mention that and other benefits of using a decentralized digital currency.
Is there anyone with a Chronicle account that can comment on the article?
