Well if no miners switched for a day people could just attack the network meaning their chain becomes profitable again

Nothing will force fiat to die it’s been around for thousands of years

It was very messy I must agree I’m not sure if bigger blocks is a good thing it sounds good in principle I guess.
@_date: 2018-05-28 20:24:58
If they were determined enough though it could be vetoed
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:52:31
Wasn’t miners got the final say if they don’t mine the blocks it doesn’t activate

Clearly not enough to convict him. If he really did why is he not convicted of said crime?
@_date: 2019-02-14 06:57:38
If he was never convicted for it you can't assume he actually did it. Enough with his case is fishy enough

Not sure you can prove bitcoin cash is centralised but an example of one that isnt by design is Monero. Which attempts to reduce ASIC's in it's eco system to combat centralisation
@_date: 2019-04-17 12:38:24
It's a functioning altcoin that has very supportive community unlike BSV. It develops on it's own and comes under heavy critisim for no apparent reason appart from people don't like it. Functionally it is no different to Bitcoin all it offers are lower transaction fees and larger blocks. It is an attempt at on chain scaling. I can't seem to get my head around the promising idea of cryptocurrency is constantly shit upon by people who say Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency and all others are scams. Now feel free to down vote me but all I've stated is the truth

Yeah the % has dropped to 23% for btc.com also the chances of a double spend are actually higher than I thought at about 25%
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:41:01
33% is not dangerous this has been covered many times.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:23:38
Sure it is but 50% isn’t a tipping point 33% has a really small chance of being successful
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:03:22
This is true and could be done but a “51% attack” could be pulled off by in fact a much lower percentage say 25% if they successfully mined enough blocks in a row
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:30:23
No it’s not pools exist solely to make profit why would they purposely destroy the block chain look at flypo who control over 50% of the zcash network
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:33:41
Ah but you’re wrong sure you’ll mine the most blocks but you’re talking about mining a streak of blocks off chain and then releasing the odds say that you won’t win the short streak at 50% the odds are after 6 blocks which are most large transactions your side chain’s start is behind the 11block median which means the nodes won’t accept it. And you can’t manipulate the time because the worker which you don’t have access to because your a pool sets that. So pools at 51% aren’t much of a concern a private individual who could manipulate block header times is though
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:54:16
Please look at zcash and their centralisation and there arguments against a 51% attack
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:40:22
Yes but if the government came knocking to multiple pools. That has the same effect. So that argument falls down I think pools being de-centralised would be the only way they could not be forced into a 51% attack. Not much could be done to stop such a 51% attack if the government came knocking
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:16:34
Your maths is correct bar the fact that In fact it’s 100x smaller 0.25^6 = 0.02441% which means that as you can see 51% isn’t the tipping point and neither is the 33% in the given pool 0.33^6 = 0.1291% 50% would give an attacker a 1.5625% chance to double spend to give an attacker a 50% chance of a double spend he’d need to have 89% of the networks hashing power (assuming six confirmations)
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:44:48
It’s not as dangerous as people think look at zcash distribution 
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:09:31
I hope your joking if “governments” wanted to do this they could just force multiple pools for the same affect.
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:43:22
What’s wrong with 50% hashrate? 51% attack? Yeah not going to happen what would a distinguished pool gain from causing a huge dip in bitcoin price if one occurred. Please research the dangers of an attack like this before scare mongering.
Edit: those down voting please lookup 51% attacks because you don’t understand.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:04:17
It should be noted that if a pool gains 51% it would control bitcoins future though
@_date: 2019-09-12 01:37:02
Sorry to nitpick but I fail to understand how bitcoin privacy can go lower?  I doesnt matter what version you're on your wallet is just a viewable as anyone elses
@_date: 2019-09-21 13:35:03
Wait is Monero considered a shitcoin? seems to offer improvements on bitcoins core principals without compromise. Bitcoin does have a fungibility problem
@_date: 2016-10-31 15:55:29
mhmm maybe I should make the buyer use a higher fee next time?
@_date: 2018-04-24 09:16:39
I love bitcoin I can reuse memes without them being called reposts they’re just called price updates
@_date: 2016-10-31 16:05:27
Just checked it looks to have gone through now with 1 confirmation :)
