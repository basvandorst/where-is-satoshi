Poop from top

For purchases over 0.2 BTC is ok. Otherwise be prepared to pay over 10% fees.

If you think that little price raise was a bullrun... you'll fall on your back when you see what may happen during 2021-2022

Research the effect of the halvings may 2020. Also research what happens 1 year before the halving may 2019, what I call the prehalving period.

What about NO.

This seems a nice dip to buy, seriously. Price standing just over PoC. We already bottomed out in december.
@_date: 2019-02-24 23:28:59
Use Nano.

Hola. Espero que hayas hecho un retiro de prueba con un monto pequeño.
Yo voy a comenzar a operar con bitstamp. Otras plataformas como CEX advierten que los wire transfers pueden llegar a tardar 1 mes.
Saludos y nos cuentas luego que pasó.
@_date: 2019-02-25 03:38:36
Use Nano then
@_date: 2019-02-24 00:46:49
Try coinmama.
You also need to know that they charge you 11.2% over bitstamp price. 
On the other hand, being your purchase a small amount youll be buying expensive BTC with any simplex website as well such as Abra or Binance. However if you buy more than 0.2 BTC you start to see nice fee cuts. Binance is the cheapest over that quantity.

Do it if not hurting your cashflow
@_date: 2019-02-25 05:31:13
If that green trend does not play out. I'm selling my portafolio. That means the halving is no longer having an effect in the BTC price. 
We are near important dates:
- may 2019 bottom has already happened. If another dump lower from that bottom occurs I'm out or preparing to abandon.
-may 2020 to end of year : if BTC price has not a clear growing trend Im defenitely out.

Thank you.

First consider that loosing the wallet is not a problem. Losing the private keys or seed words is.
You can have your private keys encrypted in a winrar file with password. A very long and strong password that you can easily remind. (You can also put this rar file inside another rar file with password for extra security)
Upload the rar file to the cloud or send it to your email account. This way you have the lowest probability of beign stolen or cracked. While you are moving abroad.
Once you get to your destination decrypt the rar file and use the seed words/private key with the wallet you used first. You can also use any wallet as the private key has to match the blockchain data not a specific wallet software in order to get your balance.

This is about patience and not getting loans in order to be able to invest. Cost averaging.
