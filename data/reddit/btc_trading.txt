Huobi following suit now. Expect BTCChina and OKcoin to also announce in next few hours. No telling what bottom on this one could be :/

I'd expect to see volume increase significantly for BTC China in the next few days. For some reason or another, they chose not to announce this development yet - maybe they are making sure there are no bugs/glitches? Or perhaps they are waiting until the 31st for a timely announcement cashing in on the hype.

for what its worth, I talked to someone who worked at the exchange, and he said that nothing major is going to happen on the 31st. Payment processors already left - the panic that we saw last month was the market reacting to this, so it seems to already have been priced in.

Here's a screenshot of the new deposit page:

Look at most recent post. Confirmed by going into my account on BTC China - option for bank transfer gone. Seems like the voucher system is essentially the same thing though

You can withdraw either through the form of a BTC Voucher (to give to someone else, presumably), or direct bank transfer (0.5% fee)

this statement is patently false - a common misconception that I hope this thread can help clear up, since clearly direct deposit into bank accounts is still allowed. It is ONLY payment processors that have been banned.

Actually, this suggests the opposite : ban is coming. Recent Weibo post by BTCChina also acknowledges that this move was done in expectation of the 4/15 ban on domestic bank transfers. RIP China
