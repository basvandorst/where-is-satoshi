No, you sell when you think the price will go lower and buy back at a lower price. You can either do this with you own cash or on the margin. That's trading, you thinking about investing. Totally different strategy.

@_date: 2018-03-30 01:12:35
We all know a recession is coming, I'm hoping for another year or two tho. That would paint a pretty picture for me. 
The question is: will Bitcoin crash with it, or will investors flock to it as a safe haven from the inevitable stock market crash?

 Because you'll be buying a 6 pack of em'
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:32:26
Finally a reasonable time frame to assume it will recover.
Everyone else seems to believe it's going to be a 30k in 2 months lol.
Anyway, welcome to the freedom train new friend! We're glad to have you aboard.
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:36:29
Yeah, my only concern is we lost a lot of the newbies that got us there in the first place. The common man is not impressed right now. 
But we have some fairly promising things to look forward too. If btc rises as fast as it fell again, even without hitting ATH, they will probably come back. 
Then we will probably have another bubble and repeat the whole damn process.

Any help is appreciated guys :)
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:31:21
No, you're right. Looking at the candles, there is quite a bit of support at 6.6k 
The comments here mirror that.
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:35:08
That's what I believe will happen in 10 years or so... basically digital gold with little fluctuation and a slow but steady rise overcome.

I'm trusting your gut over the other guys.
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:34:21
No, those who were smart would have sold at ATH then bought the first dip then sold at 17k and so on and so fourth.

Something tells me you need lots of "male vitality"
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:07:21
I hope your right because I fucking missed 6.6 watched it all day then had to do one little fucking thing and it's at 7k.
Was looking to buy around 6 if it hits. right now we're trading sideways, so either the bears ran out of steam, or they're bating us.

Why are we panicking when we will likely soon have a prime opportunity to buy and have nothing but good news looking ahead?
Everything seems well and fine to me, my only concern is the fact that everyone else is concerned.
Did you guys really think that something can go from 800-20k in a year and not drop back down? We're still at 7k which it practically unheard of and now we know the potential for btc to at least hit 20k 
All I see are reasons to buy.

Looks to be mainly market manipulation combined with the usual nonsense - some Asian country claiming to over regulate that which they don't understand.
Then there's the whole "death cross" BS. At this point people are probably panicking because people are panicking making them panic because they made those people panic..panic.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:24:02
You will panic sell before the rise...and then buy before the crash. ;)

Stock market experience hasn't transfered over to Bitcoin very well up to this point. Best advice anyone can give you is, Bitcoin is not a stock.
It is a network however, and there is a long standing theory on the calculating and predicting the value of any given network.

Yup, It turned around. I haven't looked to much at the charts today, I wasn't actually going to buy. Not feeling it yet, but if it does jump up to 6800 that could be a 2k profit on a 1 btc leverage.

I understand your skepticism Aulne, and maybe everything will implode. I suppose we could spend all day arguing for or against. 
But ask yourself this Aulne, where would humanity be right now if we never tried anything new? Where would we be if never tried to innovate, never pushed forward towards a dream, no matter how misguided. Where would the world be if nobody ever tried because their attempts may fail? 
You say a centralized point of authority is mandatory because that's the way things have always been. But what stops that authority from abusing their position? History as well as science has shown us that humanity is largely incapable of governing itself successfully, without compromise, and without corruption.
A trustless based system rooted in machines is simply a new way of addressing an old problem. Why should we not see this trough? Because we may end up losing some petty, meaningless currency? Well that is a risk I am willing to take Aulne.

I just disagree with your thought process as a whole. what ever you fancy, it's better to leave politics out it, and converse only on bitcoin here.
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:12:11
Never underestimate the power of long established institutions.
Simply put, "why trust Bitcoin when I can trust my favorite bank, plus the government will protect me" is the prevalent logic here.
If we don't stand to protect Bitcoin for all that it is, well will just end up making them stronger and more resilient.

@_date: 2018-04-11 13:49:38
And I'd like to agree with you. But Bitcoin is not innovating anymore. Hell, it's barely able to scale. We're alright for now, and lightning was a good move. But look at that whole mess it took to get us here.

Give me some good alts, I'm way outta the loop in that department except the few that I mine and they most certainly follow around Bitcoin's price like a shadow.

A claim as substantial as that truly warrants some context my dude.
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:29:22
As Nate says, the question is more can we mine and be profitable. So we already have internet and a place to mine. So hidden costs are really just racks, sub panels and circuit breakers, conduit (expensive) and outlets. Also cooling.
Mining is essentially investing, there is a risk based on speculation. When price goes up, your profits go up, especially if you hold.
But difficulty is the real concern, if difficulty is skyrocketing the whole time, you may find that even with moon prices, you would have been more profitable buying. But it could just as well go the other way. - we won't know till it happens.
However, markets do have to follow some rules to some extent or they would collapse and we inadvertently dictate this. Like miners not introducing any more new coins until the price is desirable.
 
so the odds will always be that mining will be slightly more profitable than investing in the long term if you hold profits and only sell to cover costs. (But of course you then further increase your risk exposure.)
Electricity and how much you value your time is often what will make or break you.

Shorting is usually done on the margin. You just sell when it starts to dip and have clear conscience of a bear market and then buy back when you're comfortable with the profits. 
Alternatively you can just gamble and short everytime you see a slight downturn and buy back in like 10$ increments and do the same for rises. 
Do that multiple times a day and with 10 plus btc and you're making more than most Americans make in their regular day jobs.

There is still a lot of support in the 5.5-5.8 range.

fuck this market right now, that's my recommendation. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 04:26:53
Need a quick fix eh?
Get that sexy little ass on down to local Bitcoins dot com and make an account, then find a seller who is online and accepts Western Union. From there you can pay in cash and with a fake name at most grocery stores or online with their app. And don't worry about getting scammed, just look for a seller with high rating and escrow.

The buy wall at 6.5k on kraken is legendary.
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:21:23
it could, if you can continuously trade successfully and make enough to get past all the fee's trading on the margin.
this is however, an extremely risky approach and its sounds like even in low volume, you'd be gambling more than you can afford to loose. -and there's a damn good chance you will loose, especially if your new.
there are other ways to get a head start in a dead economy but they involve the sale of that which may require jail time.
just go fill out surveys kid!

@_date: 2018-04-05 07:55:05
It's rare that that actually happens. For example, I never spend any of my Bitcoin, when i need to use it as payment, I buy some at current market price and then instantly spend it all, if that person cashes out as soon as I send it. 9 times out of ten the fluctuations won't matter. 
Small amounts, the price change is irrelevant, and in large amounts the difference is still far less than the cost of a wire transfer.

I just can't trust an exchange coin like that. Idk, maybe it is profitable but it just feels sketchy.
@_date: 2018-04-06 01:14:43
Well sure. But manipulation aside, the price has always been way more stable than it has been since it shot up at the end of '17.
That's a usual sign of inflation, the more over valued a commodity gets, the less stable it's price.
Of course a higher market cap would likely mean more stability, it would also likely mean a higher average price. But the rules are still the same.

True, I always make money on my trades but I feel like I'm just making lucky guesses and not really reading the market which means sooner or later I'm going to get burned.
That's all fine, but question is, can I win more than I loose. Idk, just feels like gambling with better odds.
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:38:47
It's possible but I don't think it will head down that low, and if it does, it won't stay there for long.

I'm actually hoping for it. but not trying to be negative, just with all the margin traders these days that's kinda just how it goes.
if you've ever wondered why everyone sells at the moment of bad news, well a big part of it is the people shorting. at this point it just seems to be the name of the game, whether or not youre on the margin.

What chimi said, this market is hard as hell to predict. 
You could play it safe at there are some signals that suggest we may drop lower before breakout.
But there also seems to signs that says the price is about to rise.  There seems to be quite a bit of market confusion ATM.
Maybe just buy in smaller increments, that way, if the price rises or lowers you have some profits locked in.

yes, But it is still traceable and could identify you. I get the feeling OP wants to remain anonymous, but that would be difficult to do if using ones own bank.
but if he were to say, use a bank account with stolen credentials, then I could see why not requiring an ID would be critical.

@_date: 2018-04-06 00:14:10
Well you come off as rather trollish so that's why I didn't bother explaining further.
If you don't believe in Bitcoin, that's your choice but keeping miners mining is a non issue. 
As the others have stated, it will be 120 years before the last coins are rolling out. If Bitcoin manages to last that long, lack of incentives for miners sure as hell won't kill it.
Also, I'd like to point out the fact that Bitcoin is not set in stone and can be changed at anytime. If fees aren't enough to sustain the miners there are 101 options to choose from. Like switching to a Proof of stake scheme.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:50:12

@_date: 2018-04-06 05:46:48
When you buy a dip at inflationary prices that's what usually happens. sure it's lower than it was, but if it's still inflated it will go lower. 
we were seeing it bounce from 6.8 to 7.2 because it's a  good buy sell strategy and it's wise to sell for a little profit instead of hoping for a rally to 9k and potentially losing it all 
But now there's signs that we may go lower so the market has stagnated because investors are watching to see which way we are headed.
@_date: 2018-04-08 06:12:00

It's not coinbase, it's the visa and that bank cucks. Blaming coinbase and closing your account was exactly their goal. 
This should only be more proof to ditch the garbage Fiat and support a decentralized system. Those fucks are showing their true colors.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:29:33
Looks more like exactly what we've seen before, unless you're about to do something wild. In which case, you have the floor.

Good one...*man*.
@_date: 2018-04-11 05:03:23
Look at which ones have a good moving average. Then do all the research you can on the ones that appear favorable and choose which one you think fills a purpose that would make people want to use it.
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:54:07
Haha, you knew exactly what I was talking about.
@_date: 2018-04-07 13:41:29
Access token invalid usually has to do with 2fa and the timestamps not being synced.
Why TF are you selling tho?
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:51:52
I actually hope it will hold in the upcoming American recession and that more property owners will accept Bitcoin because of us instability.
That's when I'll swoop in and buy up some property on the cheap and with my profits.
Then take those profits and flow them back through Bitcoin and so on and so forth. Kinda the best of both worlds and basically still avoiding fiat.
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:51:46
Well I've officially scraped the idea of getting a lambo...

It's still better than doing nothing.
I don't see anymore good coming from pissing in the wind on Reddit. 
Gotta get over that learned helplessness man.
@_date: 2018-04-07 13:21:22
Things will get worse, and then they will get better. Then the cycle continues.
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:59:32
The problem arises when you need fiat, you would have to sell to another local for cash otherwise there's unexplainable financing.
Finding a buyer may prove tedious which would lead you to advertise online that youre selling, like on local Bitcoins for example. 
Doing so could then make you an easy target for scrutiny as you likely won't be the only one doing so. They'll basically just be plucking sellers out of the bunch investigating them for money laundering. Or pass a law to make it illegal all together, and just straight up arrest you.
I suppose you could set up a shell company and buy product in Bitcoin and then sell that for your fiat needs but now you got this whole convoluted scheme just to pay your power bill.
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:39:40
There's a lot of them, they suffer from a pretty bad case of learned helplessness disorder and it's accompanied pessimism. They think everything is hopless and no one will ever succeed at anything. 
Best to just move on, they have a high probability of being "alt right" and you don't want to go down that rabbit hole.

@_date: 2018-04-01 15:20:42
I can't margin trade on either of those. So kraken is the next best thing. 
TBH, I'm less than impressed with this exchange but they offer USD trading and seem to take security seriously. Fucking gdax still won't take a yubi key directly.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:33:41
No but you're on to something here, the earth isn't flat, that's crazy talk. The earth is fiat, it's all so obvious now.

@_date: 2018-04-09 14:34:20
If you're a hodler just relax, it's all good cuz youre in it for the long run. And if you're a trader, than that's great.
Honestly, I don't see the problem. Come back in 2 to 4 years and claim your bookshelf full of lambos.

@_date: 2018-04-12 14:47:31
In the cake.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:11:40
All sounds good. But how did you turn 15 dollars a day into a million? I'm currently in a place where it would arguably be unwise to invest much more Fiat.
But these prices are good, that's what's bringing to margin trade. But the risks are so much higher I'm much less bullish.
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:55:15
Hmm, been hearing a lot about OMG lately.  Guess they're worth looking into. Thanks guys
@_date: 2018-04-17 01:17:02

if you're absolutely desperate for income, and there are no jobs what so ever, you can make a small amount of money by filling out surveys for companies. it wont be worth your time, but if all you would be doing with that time is jacking off anyway, it could be worth looking into.

Not all alts are centralized man and some of them have some good innovations.

@_date: 2018-04-09 14:37:59
See a lot of ppl claiming price manipulation and the may be right based on what we saw on bitfinex.
But I'd like to remind people that it's common place for day traders to short following bad news, especially if we're at a Shakey breakout. 
The news from Pakistan is likely what caused this. plus, India is still in recent mind, all this is probably what's giving the shorters the courage to sell.
@_date: 2018-04-21 15:00:01
That one sucked. Lol
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:01:34
Why would you not want to sell your house and take out a loan for it?
Rule number one of investing Bitcoin: invest way more than you can afford to lose.
Then panic sell at the first sign of economic downturn and you'll finally be one of us. ;)
@_date: 2018-04-06 01:10:09
Most of my coins come from trading altcoins that I have mined. So I never actually pay the full price whatever that may be.
So it kinda doesn't actually matter to me because if Bitcoin is inflated so are the alts and vice versa.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:21:43
Is it really? I stopped following up on bcash. Lol what are they doing over there?
Can't help but notice the redditor for a day tag btw

Now he's come back pretending to be "the man".
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:02:32
Right, because a 2k rise over the course of a month while still being down 12k from ATH is a clear indicator of a major breakthrough to new highs.

@_date: 2018-04-06 23:47:39
The prices we saw were greatly inflated, it will be while before we can expect that to be the norm. 
I mean, btc was trading for 8-1200 for like 2 years straight, then in a matter of 6 months we hit 20k
I say if we stay in the 4-6k range, that's still some pretty damn good gains and a sign of good things to come in the next few years.
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:16:18
I find it best to use stocks as a bit of a guidance, but not as a clear indicator. 
There are some similarities, but also a lot of discrepancies. 
Seems to me at this point that non of us really know what's going, on or what's going to happen. At least, if there are those who do, they aren't sharing. (The bastards)

Exactly, like bytecoin! Of all the altcoins I have ever seen, that one is simply the most totally-not-a-scam coin out there. 
Unless they come out with bytecoin cash! *Gasp*
@_date: 2018-04-17 01:08:35
There is, for coinbase. Their interest is in making *their* money, not making you money. I'm not saying it's a scam, but I am saying it's highly unlikely that you're going to make worthwhile money.
@_date: 2018-04-16 05:36:29

Was it long? Must have been like 20x or something, hope he was only using such large margins to keep the majority of his coins off the exchange.

Dude that Mr man guy is a psychotic shill for JP Morgan. Just laugh and don't engage.
I commend you for accepting your paycheck in Bitcoin. Cheapest way to sell is on gdax, just go there, apparently you already have a coinbase account which means you have a gdax account.
If you sell at a price slightly above or below market price, that will make you a "maker" and you'll pay no fees
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:54:13
So what's all this "massive botnet pump and dump" everyone's been going on all about?
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:46:42
Hmm, someone recently posted a comment over on the bcash sub using the exact same analogy and similar wording.

@_date: 2018-04-08 16:10:12
Idk how that can be riskless, it's hard as fuck to get the coins into another exchange fast enough to take advantage of the difference. And if you don't, you're stuck holding the coins. Granted if you're sure the market will move in your favor it's irrelevant. But then why go through the trouble of arbitration

@_date: 2018-04-10 21:55:34


This is the true reason I believe in supporting bitcoin so adamantly. not because I think it is the answer, but becuse it serves as a proof of concept. proof that we can have a system where trust is irrelevant because save for the exception of a hack (nothing is perfect) the system itself dissolves that requirement, by creating a lack of incentive to do so.
money makes the world turn as the saying goes. well if we can have a decentralized currency, than that proves we can have a decentralized government where no one entity is in charge. A truly free institution run by the people, all people, for the people.
of course we are still a far ways off, but computers do as they are told and have nothing to gain. its also worth noting that the AI sentience problem is irrelevant in the main system as one would only need that for judgement and not function.
The only real concern here is that a human will still need the write the initial code. that one in a billion person, truly pure and free of corruption. without that special enlightened individual the whole game would be rigged from the start. but, no matter how rare, now we just need one exceptional being to free us from ourselves instead of relying on millions.
TLDR; I don't actually believe in bitcoin so much as I do the idea and the possibilities it represents.

He's a long term investor, not a trader. 
Also a true believer in Bitcoin/gambling man.
The strategy he's using is to buy dip with his disposable income, (that he would otherwise spend on hookers) in hopes of seeing large profits further down the road.

It is not, you must pay regular buy and sell fees as well as interest. So you can't just short and long 100 Bitcoin's on the 10$ mark and make $1000 each time. You have to make enough to cover the fees and still make a profit.

Even if I was mining straight btc, it is still profitable. I can assure you, noone would mine if it wasn't profitable. The real question is difficulty vs price inflation. Will it stack up to warrant the cost of hardware and electricity, or is it cheaper to buy in and hold.
Usually the former over the latter (barley) but it is all speculation.
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:16:07
Apparently so, last time it did but I guess the lower we get, the closer we get to Bitcoins actual value and the less impact fud will have.

@_date: 2018-04-09 14:50:47
Margin traders aren't selling because they are scared. They are just getting on a price dropping so they can sell and then buy back at a lower price.
When a market has a large amount of margin traders, they will have a large impact on the price and then this effect is amplified.
Since we lost a lot of the new investors, based on what I see as far as volume goes, a lot of the market movement is comprised of traders right now. 
Bitcoin is currently a margin traders paradise. That's why you keep seeing 6.6k to 7.2k and then back again. Until we have more people investing again, it's going to be like this.

I know, but they have been hacked before. I'm sure it's safe, but do you want to be sitting there with the realization that all your coins are gone and all you had to do was find a computer you could trust?
$250 at Staples for a shit laptop running a live os like tails and then you never have to worry or question it. Like buying insurance for a one time fee.

At the peak of the trade, it cost me roughly 1.5k to mine enough alts to trade for one Bitcoin. Today it's a little over 3k. All costs go to the power company.
As far as buy and hodl goes, I good down to Bitcoins lowest likely prices. It's slow and painful but that's where I'm at.
But if I can make successful trades, then I start actually makes some real money. And the more I have, the more I can make. How am I supposed to avoid that temptation?

Ah fuck, 5.8k incoming boys. Thanks a lot Mithrildor.
@_date: 2018-04-06 00:05:30
What do you guys think Bitcoin's actual stable value to USD is? 
The garbage online articles paint a picture of 400-1200
But the way things are going, and the noticably lightened effect FUD seems to be having lately makes me wonder (hope) it's around 4-6k
Is this just wishful thinking?
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:37:32
Don't take it seriously I was just joking with ya man, just wanted to point out it would have been a loosing bet.
I agree, if we break 7200 and hold, we should see some solid gains. But right now it's a damn toss up as far as I can tell.

Can you use lots of technical terms if you do?
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:02:56
No, mining is still more profitable. But only if you already have the hardware. It also depends on your utility cost.
It cost me a little over 3k to mine enough alts to trade for one Bitcoin. 
But how long will it stay that way? That's why I say if you already have the hardware. It's a total crapshoot if you don't.

This is it will the massive 6.5k wall at kraken hold or was it all for show

I've learned to ignore him all together. Still love him though.
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:07:06
Well if you really want to be a pro, buy at 20k, sell at 5.9k.

Talking to yourself again?

If you boys and girls are serious about the crypto game. We need to bring on new investors. Friends family, relatives, your worst enemies, the gang members down the block. Everyone has a handle, figure it out, use it, and spread awareness.
Apparently this is why the gun debate always looses in America, cuz we win on the home front. Now I can neither confirm nor deny, but it sounds palusible.
Any exposure is good exposure is good exposure, stickers, posters graffiti, porn. You name it, get on it. Don't worry about what they say or their laughter, if you just keep hounding the point home they will eventually see things your way. (Usually at the next ATH unfortunately)
I'm not saying to scam them of course, educate them on the risks and make sure they don't go all in, but make sure they either buy, or discuss it with the next person. That is the only way we can prevail..numbers.
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:04:23
My invaluable guess is 5.5k followed by a bull run and then it's pretty much impossible to even guess after that. Lol
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:20:02
Damn he saw right through you bruh.

Bitcoin is up .26% this it boys, clear shot straight to the moon.
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:52:29
Uh dude, you've got it horribly backwards. The whole reason people even bet on Bitcoin in the first place is it's finite supply. 
Most currencies get their value buy how much is in circulation and demand. Bitcoin is no different. As time goes on, more and more coins will be lost from irresponsible wallet holders and thus the value should rise.
They estimate there are already 4million lost coins out of the total 17 million mined. -it hasn't even been ten years!
Tldr; fuck you.

He's not going to look back. He's smart enough to know it'd wreck him to find out he could have bought at 40k and then sold at 5.9k instead of 20k.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:56:04
But I'm the same way. Lol 
6.5k wall is still holding on kraken but it looks like it's broken every where else. If it's anything like kraken, there isnt much to stop it past that point.
Thank God there are only so many Bitcoins. But how many more do the bears have. They look like they're running out of steam yet there always seems to be new volume available to sell.
@_date: 2018-04-07 03:25:21
Oh there's a Friday pump coming alright, if ya get my drift. ;)
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:49:12
It isn't really TA so much as it is stating that that's where a lot of people are willing to buy at, based off  posted limit orders and past trends. 
Identifying support levels is less about speculation and more about what you can actually see. It doesn't guarantee that Bitcoin will do anything.

Well I admire your tenacity...
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:35:45
I'm not going to lie here, if that community is that commited I may buy some and sell it all at the next ATH seems like a scam coin that if you get in early enough and get out soon enough, you could make some sexy profits
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:48:25
I can't believe all the people who called it was actually right. There have been so many new retards expecting to get rich in a month and then shitting themselves I forgot that there is actually some people on this sub that actually know what they're talking about.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:03:43
No cannot kill the lambo joke, this is r/Bitcoin damnit!!
Obviously I'd prefer a Ferrari as that have greatly superior handling and I actually know how to drive them and drive for a sport. But that doesn't change the fact that this is r/Bitcoin man.

Aw, don't be mean to Dash, it's had enough problems without you dogging on it all the time.
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:08:58
That would hurt the decentralization of it as well as make little since. 
They feed off all of that because they are part of all the work, recognition, and user base. Just a disagreement was met, it's the same block chain right up until the fork.
I get where you're coming from, and that's why there must be a name change, but we could have just as well as been on the loosing side and bash would be Bitcoin. 
This way, if there is a large enough disconcensus, both parties can get their way as well as merge together down the road if an agreement is met. (Though it's never been done before and is highly unlikely)
