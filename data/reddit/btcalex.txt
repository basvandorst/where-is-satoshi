If you are in Chicago, St. Louis, or Phoenix, I can show you where to buy them with Cash at an ATM.

It looks to me like the network is just taking a while today. I have an unconfirmed transaction that I sent two hours ago. 
Sometimes it just takes a little longer than usual.

You can't use prepaid cards to buy bitcoin from most services that sell Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:57:23
I'm really impressed with this. I'm finally able to buy and withdraw BTC quickly, without exorbitant fees and waiting times.
Well done.

Maybe he's half Bear, half Manwhale.

Try circle.com. You can link a debit or credit card to it and withdraw bitcoins to USD on that credit card.

[Here's]( the link from earlier. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 22:42:21
I'm not sure which one it is, but I found their [website]( . 
I know they have one in the currency exchange by the blue line in the Thompson Center.

How is that not a bigger deal in this thread? 
Also, I like that bitcoin is so easy to acquire now that having a basic knowledge of internet functions (i.e. uploading pictures) isn't necessary to own BTC. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:33:17
Yes. You're the *only* one who's thinking of buying at a lower price in hopes of it getting higher. I'm sure that *nobody* else is doing the same thing. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:29:23
That kind of what I expected would happen when I wrote [this]( last week. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:29:27
I personally run a full node on DO for testing purposes and I really wish you weren't blocking us. It's hard to do testing when people block the communication methods. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:56:32
No, I understand. I would end up doing the same thing too. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:01:37
I'm not an investor though. We need bitcoin for working capital. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:32:51
I'm not concerned about it, but I'm more curious about why this is happening. It's happening with increasing frequency. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:04:09
I believe they will refund you. I've never had an issue with genesis mining. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 11:37:58
So wait. You are taking people's personal info and haven't thought about how to store that?
Everyone, this guy just told that he's about to get hacked and have everyone's personal info, and likely your bitcoin, stolen. 
, There are some things you can't overlook. In bitcoin, security is first and foremost and I've got a feeling you aren't up to snuff on it.

At this point, I'm building out our attic and basement with false walls and some furniture, just in case. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:21:17
No, but I'm ready to protect my friends. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 13:24:28
Actually, that asterisk proves otherwise. 
* FX may apply
Sending 200 costs 10, so a .5% transaction fee. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 03:39:51
The procedure you mentioned earlier retained information until X passes. It's ok to retain it, just make sure it's encrypted and stored securely. 
@_date: 2016-11-10 17:24:06
I'm not sure what this is, but I'll take it. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 20:18:21
There may be more than that. What area are you in? 
@_date: 2016-12-16 11:40:13
Even if it isn't, he's admitted in an earlier thread he hasn't given much thought about what to do with personal data...
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:20:24
But it might have been just one instance I had that caused me to think so. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 20:18:43
Honestly though, Circle, you respond faster on Reddit than you do to your CSR email. Do you guys want more Customer Service Reps? I'm pretty good at it and I'm tired of working where I do. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:34:15
Ummm.. "be-cash".
@_date: 2017-04-03 23:10:35
I would definitely check Bitcoin ATM's. It's a higher markup than Coinbase, but it's sooo much faster. A few of them even have dedicated customer support. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 20:54:32
Didn't Hal Finney die a while ago? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:47:42
I was mostly just pointing out the "420"sat/byte.

Kim Dotcom doesn't deserve all the praise he gets. He's a hack. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 02:31:34
It has a direct [source]( that it doesn't change much though. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 01:25:55
Your current markup is nearly [53%](

Congrats! Out of curiousity, what was the make and model of your first car?
@_date: 2016-10-13 14:27:21
How is he even allowed to make comments to the SEC? He's not an American citizen. 
Could someone who understands the laws regarding this explain it to me? 
@_date: 2015-03-18 18:50:56
Use better words. "Offensive (or Proactive) cybersecurity" 
That's how I usually describe what I do. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 15:27:13
Check out [Coin ATM Radar]( I know that the one's around me have an 8K daily limit after you verify. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:08:26
I actual saw a huge uptick in business after I rebranded from 
"Penetration Testing" to "Proactive Cybersecurity" 
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:14:47
No problem, if you don't mind telling me your High School Mascot?
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:53:18
How is this not higher? Spring is as soon as next week. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:14:01
They started it before that though, so...
