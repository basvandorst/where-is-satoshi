Lol. So now it’s wrong  to be polite and advice people to get informed and decide on their own.

I will release your comment into nothingness now. ��

I deleted it because i knew it would be your line of attack and I realised I didn’t need to give you that. There is no discussion at all here. Just read, find out what core and cash respectively represent and make your own choice based on that. There is nothing else to say. They will speak for themselves.

at the moment it is much better than bitcoin im afraid. Again, try to find out if it is the best one out there or not.
I do recommend this video if you want to know how to confront the forking question in the future.

who knows, time will tell. But it is positioning itself technically for that 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:33:43
sort out the facts and opinions in this one, lol!

Do take the time to investigate this most important question on your own. Take your time until you fully understand the difference, not just from answers posted here on this /sub, but read into it. Maybe you can read the white paper, look at some youtube videos and read a lot both here and in /btc. 
If you do, you will be very glad you did, and you might benefit a LOT from doing it. Dont just take for granted what they tell you here or there in 10 lines, get at it through different angles and opinions
