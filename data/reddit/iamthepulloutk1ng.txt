Only starting like 6 months ago, because the growth of the BTC economy is too fast and the protocol wasn't built to handle this much traffic.  Before that the fee would have been a few cents.  
The system isn't set up to inherently charge large transaction fees, it's a technological issue that can be worked through.


lol what?  It was less than $30 just 60 years ago... 
It's only valuable now because the US ordered it's citizens to surrender their gold under Nixon, essentially creating a black market, and it's only $1,300 now because people like you buy gold certificates, which are literally just pieces of paper that give you no access to the physical gold.  The gold market is one of the most artificially inflated markets that exist, possibly surpassing real estate circa 2007.
Would you say that gold certificates are better than distributed P2P ledgers?  I wouldn't.

How can you be sure the stock or housing markets won't collapse again like they did in 2008?  
How can you be sure commodities won't plummet in value, especially onces like gold which have mostly been traded only on paper in derivatives markets since the 1960's?
How can you be sure fears of inflation won't cause mass cash withdrawals from banks, causing hyper-inflation like in the 1930's?  
How can you be sure our country's credit won't be downgraded making it impossible to pay back our deficit?
How can you be sure that the world won't switch off of USD as its standard?
If your answer is "well, I just feel like it's less likely" then you're MAYBE MARGINALLY correct.
Manage your risk.  Or just don't invest anything at all, because it's ALL gambling.  This particular flavor of gambling merely has the highest return and, compared to actual casino-gambling, a fairly low amount of risk.

You can't buy most coins with fiat currency, most of them have to be purchased using BTC.  
Many can be purchased in ETH as well, but that's about it.
Most coins are privately-owned.  Not BTC.  When you give your money to an alt coin, you're kind of giving that money to private individuals (kind of, but not really, it's complicated) but when you put your money into BTC it's more like putting that money towards a utility.

Gold did not have an intrinsic value when it was widely adopted as a financial standard in the 17th Century.  Nor did it have intrinsic value when it was literally pressed into coins previous to that.
It's only intrinsic value is space travel and computing, the rest of its worth is purely based on its rarity.

Most of the "market confidence" you hear about comes from people who have never even bought a Satoshi.
A bet against BTC is a bet against your own wealth.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:51:14
You mean... Exactly lke Satoshi did when he created bitcoin?
The reason 1 BTC can be split 100,000,000 ways isn't an accident/coincidence, it's because the creator(s) calculated that if the entire world adopted BTC then 1 satoshi (the minimum denomination of BTC) would still be worth less than 1 penny is currently worth.
You're like a guy who sees that smart phones have potential but decide not to buy Apple stock because there's no completely certain way of knowing if the market will adopt them widely.
You'll never have an instrument that can accurately predict the future value of a commodity or currency, ever.

Right now BTC serves as the settlement layer for the entire crypto economy, which I would say is majorly important, and in fact makes all the other coins quite niche in comparison.
It will likely always serve this purpose because it's the most public/decentralized coin, which is all it needs to be to serve that purpose.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:22:55
Hopefully not, because as I said, other coins are centralized and privately owned.  
You might be able to trade one coin for another in the future without having to manually use BTC as a medium, but the value of those coins will still be tethered to the settlement layer, BTC.
Just like you can trade commodities, services, and currencies from EUR to JPY but the value of EUR and JPY are still tethered to USD as the settlement layer.

I have been to Europe on multiple occasions.  
I'm also not patriotic in the least, I'm merely stating the objective fact that the US is far wealthier and still holds, basically, a monopoly on intellect despite born-and-raised Americans themselves not being very educated.
You also come off as a huge douchebag, for the record, so I doubt your last sentence.  What have you done to earn that right?  You already know what I've done to earn it because I told you.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:03:45
As cheap as more European Universities are, the best and brightest still pay to come here and earn degrees from typically much more prestigious schools.
And as downhill as America is headed, it currently still has 4x the wealth of the next-richest country with 1/5th of the people, so about 20x the wealth per capita.  Plenty of opportunity exists here for people that didn't just fuck around and get a useless degree to make that money back.

You were a completely arrogant ass, read over your previous comments. The fact that you now have the nerve to ask that question makes you seem like a narcissist or a child.

For me to break even on a BTC purchase I made 3 months ago the market would have to drop by about 60% value, and that already takes the recent dip from $19,000 to $13,000 into consideration.
Statistically you're far more likely to make money than lose money on a BTC purchase because the upwards volatility is greater and more frequent than the downwards volatility.

Except statistically actual gambling has much lower odds...

Futures are intended to short Bitcoin. Opposite of embracing it.  It's betting on Bitcoin's failure.
I can make a bet against a contender in a boxing match. That doesn't mean I'm embracing the contender who I'm betting against, it just means I like to gamble.
Besides that, there really is no possible way to keep Wallstreet money from flowing into Bitcoin. I for one wouldn't want to stop it, because I want bitcoin to become widely adopted, which it never will be if it remains on the fringe forever.  Just because Wallstreet and Banks can put their money into bitcoin doesn't mean they'll have the power to manipulate it to the same degree that they manipulate stocks, especially when it grows so large where it starts absorbing the real estate and gold derivatives market (which is in the quadrillions of dollars) which I am betting it will.  Wallstreet is in bed with banks and corporations, giving them an obvious edge in the market.  They aren't in bed with bitcoin.

There's already other forks and ICOs so there's many competitors and there has been for a long time.  Miners eventually go where the trading is happening or they lose money, simple as that.

Actually bitcoin has quite a lot of intrinsic value, as it is not merely a currency, but a sophisticated internet protocol written by the world's leading experts in cryptography and other related fields of computer science, (the "cypherpunks" from Silicon Valley are more than likely Satoshi) and published in an academic white paper.  Part of testing the merit of bitcoin was letting the hacking community attack it, allowing economists to analyze it's internal mechanisms, allowing top-level computer science academics try to find flaws in the logic, and in the end it proved bullet-proof.  It's also one of the first technologies to interact with block chain.  
Modern currencies can't be efficiently used as a store of value because governments are all currency locked into a race, trying to buy as many bonds as they can as quickly as they can, which causes inflation. Despite Leonardo di Vinci coming up with the gold standard circa 1600, which was an effective way of battling currency manipulation at the time, (even though UK/US/Germany didn't adopt until the 1800's) those analog control methods are no longer immune to institutional tampering because the economy is now digital, not analog.  Cryptocurrency is simply the next logical progression in the transfer of value in a digital society, and like all "firsts" (IBM, General Mills, Ford, etc) it is a safe bet that if cryptocurrency survives bitcoin itself will thrive.  
Someone who thinks bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general are just another form of fiat currency has obviously missed the technical achievements entirely, which are really the important part of bitcoin.

Correction to about 6650 was expected so we're now over-corrected.
Since we're already underneath that price, a drop to 5400 in the next few days wouldn't be that surprising.  Even if we drop that low, likeliness of shooting back up to 6650+, where we realistically should be at, is still very high, at least according to bitcoin's history over the past 1.5 years.
There really isn't much cause to be alarmed (if you're ignoring the 51% hashing power "attack", which I am, as it seems like a cash-grab caused by people upset that B2X isn't happening) unless the price hits $4000 in the next few days, and even then I would personally still hold.

It's just a correction.  
Does nobody here use moving averages?  It could easily hit 5500 and it would still not be surprising, this is normal volatility.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:35:50
Well this is a little different because BTC has never faced a 51% hashing power attack before.  So that makes it a little more scary.  But if bitcoin survives, which I am betting it will, that proves it is indeed resilient against the 51% hashing power attack.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:33:24
How does the very first internet protocol designed to utilize blockchain technology to change how the transfer of currency works, which all future cryptocurrencies are based off of, not have any intrinsic value?
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:51:34
It was 4000 in the beginning of October.  Chill.  This is a very normal correction.  Just look at the moving averages.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:30:39
If the price is already beneath the moving averages and then it drops 10%, that isn't a correction, that makes the coin undervalued.  The correction in that case would be an increase to the value.  
A correction has to do with what the expected price of bitcoin is according to the moving averages.
