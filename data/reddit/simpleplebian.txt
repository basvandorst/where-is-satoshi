Right now I have all my BTC stored in the online wallets of coinbase.com and bitstamp.net.  I've been considering moving to offline storage because I'm afraid the Brits might shutdown BitStamp or the US Gov't might shutdown coinbase.  This looks like a great option, but its a shame it wont be out for another 5 months.  Do you guys have any better options you can suggest?
TL;DR All my coins are stored online, do you guys have a good suggestion for an easy to use offline wallet?

The 5% fee makes sense considering they have to convert into fiat and then process the payment and make a profit.  Also billpayforcoins.com seems to be down right now.

Keep it in bitcoin and move it to a different exchange to withdraw it.

Oh wow. That's a lot bigger of an issue than I thought.  Thanks for the clarification. The tech talk is a little too complicated for my skills.

Threema is a lot better than this.  It is client side encryption and the transfer of keys is done in person using QR codes so they never have access to the keys.  
Gliph does their encryption server side so they have the ability to look at your messages.

everyone should read both  Daemon and Freedom imo

I guess I have the option to create a new google acct to use specifically with this but I shouldn't have to go through that step.

How do they avoid fraud?

FYI Link is dead.

Also the panic sell might have saved Gox.  They had like 100k btc traded yesterday compared to 450k traded over the previous 30 days.  That's a lot of fees.

Check out "Threema"  for iOS and Android. very user friendly yet comprehensive encrypted messaging app.

Just don't buy them right now.  The market is really inflated and a run on MtGox is just getting started.  When Gox collapses the price is gonna drop significantly, just be ready to buy in at that point.  If you are American I suggest setting up a verified coin base account (WWW.coinbase.com).

Check out Threema for iOS and android, relatively user friendly.
@_date: 2013-09-09 13:49:37
Yea my bad, must have been an issue with the mobile client I'm using.
@_date: 2013-08-20 20:19:39
Ok thanks for the advice.  
@_date: 2013-08-20 19:53:08
So if you haven't made a transaction recently then you are less vulnerable.  Correct?
Edit: Regardless everyone should clear their browser cache and update their extension if that's what they are using to access blockchain

coinbase.com, you wont get your coins for 3 days but at least they lock you in at the market price of btc at the time of purchase.

You didn't post constructive criticism.  You posted a stupid question.  If you want to actually learn about bitcoin then you're going to have to put in a little effort buddy.
@_date: 2013-08-09 14:17:05
Threema for iOS and android is pretty user friendly as far as end to end encryption apps go.
@_date: 2013-08-20 18:18:55
If you have 2 factor authentication enabled, you're not vulnerable to this bug right?
@_date: 2013-07-13 02:38:49
Its brand new, I actually just found out about it today through this subreddit actually.  I wanna sign up but it forces you to use a Google acct.
@_date: 2013-06-17 20:43:22
So you should integrate bitcoin payments into your new pub...
@_date: 2013-10-03 14:45:19
When they say seized I'm assuming they mean they got a hold of the private keys.
@_date: 2013-07-12 22:54:41
They need to allow you to not link with google
