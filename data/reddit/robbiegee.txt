(almost) Nobody that "invest" in gold actually holds any physical gold though, so they're not going to be able to make that ring if the gold value suddenly plummets. You'd have to sell it online and buy it from a store, which is surprisingly similar to how we exchanged Bitcoins at the start.

(I was thinking about being funny and caving in immediately to you, but...) What I mean is that if you aren't being hounded by "investors" all the time, you can afford to listen a person out since not everyone has the balls to stand up to someone, but might still have very interesting opinions.
For instance, think about the "silent nerd" most (?) people have in their lives. They don't speak often, but when they do it's something well though out and smart. The type I'm thinking of was used to having their voice dismissed, so when challenged they rarely bother to stand up for it.
Being polite and inquiring further will usually pay off, it's just the very few that actually *can't* afford to since it would take all their time.

Science. More specifically quantum physics, there's a formula where you can calculate the probability. Prof. Brian Cox explained it in the TV lecture "A night with the stars" on BBC.

Not sure how much you changed in the edited comment above, but yes I was thining of doing it very similar to what you're saying, using blockchain.info to count votes - with one additional check. I'm going to track each transaction back 2 links to see if it came from a specific address, the one I own and from which the bits came from. If the transaction looks like this:
``` address owned by me* &lt;- ``` address* &lt;- ``` address, owned by me*
It's counted as a valid vote as I will send out 1 bit to each address, hand control over to someone that's registered to my cause and tell them to donate that 1 bit to the  address

If you want to count donations as votes, that's certainly how you would do it. However if you want each person to only have 1 vote (or at least make it bothersome to create more votes), you need a way to track the validity of each vote.
It's still possible to cheat how I suggest doing it, but it requires a person to donate several times to get more votes instead of simply sending massive amounts of transactions.
By the way, I thought 1 bit was one satoshi? I was thinking of the lowest sum possible with bitcoin as the actual money donations wouldn't happen by voting.

I didn't see him proposing getting rid of the police or an anarchy state. I found it interesting myself, there's been some futurologists before talking about small semi-governed city-nodes of about 50.000 people. You will still have something akin to federal laws, state laws, city laws, ..., but there was something about the larger populace it governed, the less it could legislate so you get a cascading effect of laws. I think the idea was that if you didn't like the local laws, it would be possible to move without losing touch with your family and perhaps even job.
It's sort of "natural" selection of laws and politicians.

Check my comment history and you'll see that I've spoken positively about Bitcoin recently. With that in mind, I do NOT advice you to take out a loan to buy bitcoins. I bought some because I had saved up money and I can afford to lose them, and I accept that there's a good possibility that I might, or it can take a long time to rebound. When I say Bitcoin has a future, I'm first of all talking about the underlying technology, the unused feature set and a time frame of 10-20 years.

Bitcoin does provide something that is unheard of, but it's a technology and only has one application built on top of it right now. I was sold on Bitcoin not for the money aspect, but when I heard that [transactions use a script to verify itself]( **THIS** is what makes Bitcoin revolutionary, but to really see why you probably have to be a programmer, or at least understand what programming is.
It's difficult to explain what makes Bitcoin special because it requires that the person you explain it to already knows a lot of other things. For example, I can't explain the intricacies of race conditions in multi-threaded applications running on distributed computing with an unreliable network and clients you can't trust, without you already having spent a few years studying it. Granted, Bitcoin is a quite a bit simpler to understand than that, but without me knowing what you know, I don't really know where to begin.

Posting another reply here. I love Bitcoin for the technology. I view it as something more than transferring money. It's a contract thats validity can be checked by a simple script.

No you'd get a number that tells you the difference between what you thought it was worth and the actual value that you can back up with "stuff" like oil, machines, electronics, etc. I'll try to explain to the best of my ability, just keep in mind I don't have an education in economics. I just dabble in it.
Anyway: So if you have $1 but after a count found that your assets were valued at $1.2, your dollar is worth more than you thought before the count. This is a "strong dollar", I'll get back to what it means for export and import.
Think of it like this way: You're the US and I'm China. You've got a plot of land and there's some arable land, plots that contain oil and in your back yard you have a mini setup that makes it into gas, plus you even have some gold and jewelry in your safe. You also dabble in making machines, weapons, electronics and more! Dang son, you're a real go-getter!!
However we haven't agreed on which currency to use, but we do exchange them and to do that we estimate how much they're worth against each other based on all of that stuff you have above. You've got all these machines and whatnot lying around, that's assets you own and guarantees that the $1000 dollar bills you have is worth at least something. If we count them up I can calculate how much your stuff is worth. We count it, haggle and argue for a while until we agree that in your currency your stuff is worth $1100 dollars and my stuff is worth $800. In my currency your stuff is worth 6800 Yuan and my stuff is worth 5000 Yuan. From this we agree that the conversion rate between our currencies are $1 to 6.22 Yuan.
Now we get to the export and import. The stronger your dollar is, the cheaper it is for you to buy my stuff since the currency conversion will move in your favor. On the other hand, you might get problems selling stuff since i can't afford buying your stuff now, but my neighbor Russia can since he somehow came over some new stuff. Unless I can move the currency conversion in my favor, things will just get more and more expensive for me to import. In other words, I'm getting poorer. So it makes sense to want to have a strong currency, but if your stuff gets too expensive, your exports will suffer. Now in this analogy that's not a problem, but if you're a politician and have people that lose their jobs over this, it becomes a problem even though a strong currency means your country gets wealthier.

Not the way I would count the votes. For each transaction, I would check if it came from a valid address. A valid address would be one I had sent to a voter. Each voter would have one address and would choose between the addresses I had, one for "yes", one for "no", and perhaps one for "abstaining" to indicate they participated, but disagreed somehow (and with Bitcoin they could include the reason with the vote).
I wonder, was the explanation good enough? I consider making a few drawings so everyone can understand by a quick glance how it would work. It's really easy to see what I mean if I just illustrate it. I have Photoshop and a Wacom pen, I might as well just get to it.

I saw a documentary a few days ago on YouTube about gold trading. One of the things mentioned was how much problems the banks had when Argentina suddenly demanded to withdraw all of the gold. Actual gold that they had deposited. Apparently they just was able to find all of it after a lot of searching, but it does raise the question, what would happen if a larger player did the same thing. In this context, Argentina didn't have that much gold.
Supposedly, the last full count of the gold in Fort Knox was in 1930. There was supposed to be one in 1950 as well, but it only got part way before it was shut down from above. Soo... since 1950, there has been zero accounting of the actual gold. It's mostly on paper as "rented out".
All of the above statements were from the documentary. I don't know how much I believe about it, especially since they promoted the importance of having gold to support the value of the currency, which doesn't make much sense to me. I'd think in order to estimate your currency, you'd figure out the countries assets and exports (plus, I'm certain, more I haven't thought of) and divide by how much currency you have put into the system. That's your currencies actual value. Your gold is just a fractional amount of your assets (well... hopefully).

Very true, Bitcoin is to money as the Internet was to telephones. The ones that were there at the start saw it as a bumpy ride with outages, terrible usability, predictions of its downfall, ridicule of users and attempts of sabotage it is still happening (net neutrality vote is up in February).
What we're seeing is the transformation of our society into a Type 1 civilization. The Internet was the first step, a technology that's a true Type 1 technology, a global communication medium. Every single one of these technologies will be demonised by those that has something to loose from it's emergence.
For the sake of our future we should fight for science and technology. Without that, we are doomed to experience the dark ages v2.

I'm not saying Bitcoin will succeed because it experiences ridicule, but ridicule happens because people doesn't understand Bitcoin. It will succeed because it offers a new technology that's useful, but most people don't see it yet, mostly because most people aren't programmers. 
Internet took off because HTTP and webpages was built on top of it. Compare Bitcoin to TCP/IP and it's easier to see why most people don't bother with it yet. Something that's built on top of Bitcoin will be made that's useful to most people, but probably just as TCP/IP you won't even notice Bitcoin is at the core of it.
BTW, I'm referring to Bitcoin as the technology, not the "flavor". Whether it's Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin or whatever flavor you're talking about is absolutely irrelevant. They're all built on the same technology and that's the revolution.

Bitcoin is a programmable contract. Can you seriously not see how that's a fucking awesome technology? Forget everything about how it's used as money, that's just an application. HTML existed for ages before Facebook was a thing, you want me to prove Bitcoins validity as if it is HTML and the year is 1985.


So am I, and I disagree with you. I've written software for distributed computing and parsers for data mining. Granted I don't have the same experience as you writing encryption algorithms, but I do understand how encryption works and I don't see what's wrong with Bitcoin. You claim Bitcoin is a flawed proof, so prove it.
Again, Bitcoin is a programmable contract. I'm going to use it now as a voting mechanism for one project. I have another idea for using Bitcoin to let users create missions in a game. These are small ideas and the users won't even notice that Bitcoin is at the core of it, just like my dad doesn't know that TCP/IP is at the core when he's communicating over skype, paying his bills online or playing chess with a friend on his phone.
