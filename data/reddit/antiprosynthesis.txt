Some will go, but I think you'd be surprised how many stay.
@_date: 2016-08-14 16:25:24
Ethereum is still very much divided, but then what to expect from a special interest driven bailout fork...
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:32:47
And you didn't pay for it either in the form of costs translated to the customer. If you're not satisfied, use another exchange or your own wallet.

Zane Tackett *is* his real name. There's a new website on the internet since a couple of years. It's called "Google" and allows you to search for people, as well as risk management tutorials/strategies. It's pretty amazing.

Uh, Pokemon was extremely mainstream 20 years ago. Pretty much an instant hit.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:24:46
It's fair, and poster is clearly emotional, but I think some transparency is owed as well.
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:52:36
Have to agree that there is lack of transparency that is unsustainable. I doubt this will stay that way though.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:21:23
That made sense. This guy is now my mentor.

Most successful hacks are either inside jobs or social hacks. True outside hacks rarely work out unless security is an absolute shit show.

Why on earth Java though? Was this to get it done faster at the expense of performance?
@_date: 2016-04-02 23:42:35
Can't deny that PoW is terribly wasteful though...
@_date: 2016-04-17 15:08:55
So, was there any concrete code written yet? Seems like a desperate approach to catch up with Ethereum so far...
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:12:20
Or as my new mentor would say: ME ISSUE LOT UNDERSTAND FOLKS RANT THE BETTER HERE (IRONICAL 74%)...... !!!

i don't see how promoting cryptocurrency through things like nascar or ufc will change anything. average audience for those is poor and bird brained.

A post that reeks of desperation. Cut your losses, kid.
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:14:36
I said 'average', not 'all'.
@_date: 2017-02-22 10:13:59
Against BTC perhaps. ETH is stable against fiat for one.
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:44:49
You're not making sense to me. Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:03:41
ETC is actually even worse than LTC. It has no value proposition besides the fact that it can be traded. It doesn't have any development community behind it.
@_date: 2015-05-27 08:35:47
Investing on principle = investing on emotions. Get ready to lose.
@_date: 2015-05-27 09:22:00
I didn't try to predict the future. Just saying that 'principle' is an irrational investment strategy...
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:59:56
Even though I did not like the Ethereum hard fork, ETC is a dead chain now. No development, only pump and dumps.
@_date: 2017-02-08 19:42:30
I'd say Ethereum has a bit of a head start there.
@_date: 2017-02-22 10:18:40
The fact that this kind of spam is possible is a pretty fundamental weakness in the first place.

Given his financial decision making, I don't think he has a lot of money to lose...
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:56:55
Bitcoin *was* antifragile when there were no other and objectively superior crypto coins around. On a technical and fundamental level it is rapidly sinking into irrelevance.
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:59:18
Are you kidding? The title is specifically evoking negative sentiment towards any coin that is not BTC. Not exactly a mature and professional conduct to alter the article title like that.
Edit: Nevermind...
@_date: 2017-03-28 06:25:31
Dash has all the characterstics of a scam. And with the pump now collapsing, while ETH just keeps value like a brick, the bag holders will spam desperately. I've been warning about this, and I hope it won't disappoint these poor people to the point of leaving crypto altogether...
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:21:05

Rootstock seems far from ready though:  Unless they went closed source? Seems really fishy to me.
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:29:26
Proof? Thought so.
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:43:17
That's the case for Bitcoin indeed...
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:43:39
And what is the problem exactly? Have you read the thread?
@_date: 2017-03-27 12:52:59
That is a perfect summary of how to reevaluate investments.
@_date: 2017-03-07 08:34:30
Let's not mention that the Winklevi hold a ton of ETH as well.
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:57:33
Greed. He should cash out and diversify.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:41:13
Yes, it's all a conspiracy against Bitcoin. Everything is fine here. /s
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:44:31
Yes, and?
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:40:03
You're trying to reason with people that are way overinvested in BTC and consider any other crypto a mere altcoin. It's pointless.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:54:54
Sorry, but it's the years of stagnatian that are killing Bitcoin and its copycats. Hubris comes before the fall. You can't expect to survive waiting while the next in line is actively innovating.
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:14:48
Would love to see the source code. Oh, there isn't any. 
Rootstock has been vapourware for quite a while now.
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:09:49
I guess, like Donald Trump, he knows a guy that told him it's yuuuge.
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:02:28
Do you seriously think a shallow copy of Bitcoin, with much of the same people involved, will replace Bitcoin? Both have been stagnant on all fronts for years, while the next in line kept innovating. Sorry, but this is the classic song of the bag holder.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:00:06
Ok, forget my other comment. Inverse psychology :)
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:00:51
You bring strong arguments to the table.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:44:32
Your spelling and punctuation is on par with your analysis ability. Ethereum does not have unlimited supply. The one fork that happened was a huge hit for the value of ETH, but since developers continued to work behind the scenes, the limited lack of consensus that was there did not affect fundamentals as much as people had feared. Ethereum is also not PoS, but it has a scaling roadmap that involves moving toward a PoS scheme, but not before ensuring that this is a safe and economically sound move. Please do your due diligence.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:52:01

@_date: 2017-03-26 22:52:15
What makes you think you're not doing these things yourself though?
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:38:59
I'm still not seeing proof for any of your statements.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:57:09
One or more bad apples that were actively condemned by the rest of the Ethereum community were responsible for this. Don't throw a whole community on one big pile.
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:58:29
20k was his initial investment.
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:58:01
I guess you're unaware of the active backing by Barry Silbert and his 'news' site CoinDesk in those days. As far as I know it wasn't started by 'Bitcoiners', but some of them definitely took the opportunity to promote it to undermine what they clearly perceived as a threat to their investment in Bitcoin.
That said, every community has less desirable actors, and greed can bring out emotions like this. That's one of the reasons development and price have been separated from the start in the Ethereum community.
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:44:50
You might want to read the blog post he wrote regarding that tweet. He admitted it to be a mistake, basically.
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:41:38
How is this in any way constructive to the discussion?
@_date: 2017-03-29 01:36:10
I'd say Altavista vs Google is probably a better comparison. Or Blockbuster vs Netflix. The list goes on...
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:49:22
I'm sure they do. A lot of them probably already left for greener pastures though.
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:00:17
How is this constructive?
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:33:30
If you're happy, I'm happy.
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:02:32
Ah, you only represent the vocal, toxic part. I see :)
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:05:08
There is no point in arguing this with Bitcoin maximalists/cultists. Imagine having most of your net worth invested in a crumbling asset. You would probably initially jump into defense mode as well, even if it would be to get out at the best price. It's the people that are able to constantly reevaluate their investments that make money. Not the hopers and believers.
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:26:01
Did you read the rest of that thread? Also, aren't you aware of state pruning and other measures for scaling? Combined with storage getting ever cheaper, I really don't see the problem here.
@_date: 2017-03-30 12:01:00
Yes, but those individuals also happen to be its developers :/
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:01:58
The word 'Bitcoiners' made me cringe hard.
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:40:40
Don't trade a manipulated pump and dump in any direction unless you like to gamble.
@_date: 2017-03-29 09:51:17
The problem is that there is nothing to show for. It's promises, but there is no code. Just look at their GitHub: 
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:58:18
Found the moron that bought at $1100.
@_date: 2017-01-08 01:54:51
They have zero fee transactions. That basically allows any user to buy/sell from/to himself at no cost. It's not necessarily fake, but definitely less reliable of an indicator.
@_date: 2015-08-03 09:18:12
I hate to break it to you. But you are definitely not in the top 1% with that dated skillset...
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:26:54
Probably? Sounds like you're making assumptions to confirm your bias.
@_date: 2017-04-05 16:42:48
You might want to read the last paragraph. It's an extremely odd article.
@_date: 2016-02-15 06:09:52
It has a lot of confirmations, so in practice it's actually a lot faster than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-13 16:29:00
I guess you don't mind waiting an hour for payment to arrive, or are paying the centralized fees to avoid those perhaps. Point is that, at least for me, it's far easier to just pay with a regular debit/credit card than it is to pay with BTC. Only Bitcoin fanatics seem to want to deal with that...
@_date: 2017-04-10 19:38:58
There's text below the article title as well ;)
@_date: 2017-04-13 15:47:59
That's cool. Now to find one of the other 5 or so people on planet earth that go through the slowness and general annoyance of paying for goods with BTC.
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:51:54
Indeed. When a website goes down due to high traffic, you don't blame its users for trying to hammer their way inside. That is the responsibility of the server.
@_date: 2017-04-12 07:14:54
Frankly, I think he's doing everything to create a liquid market to dump his massive LTC holdings into. Constant pump tweets and blogs, as well as abusing his position at Coinbase to push LTC there, an arguably pointless BTC clone. It smells.
@_date: 2016-02-15 01:00:30
Ethereum is not a scamcoin. Do your research. That said, I see no correlation in that graph.
@_date: 2017-04-01 09:38:24
I do believe in Ethereum, but I have the utmost respect for the accomplishments of Bitcoin as well. There would be no Ethereum without Bitcoin after all. One of the reasons I left Bitcoin is the exact attitude you're displaying here though: hubris, arrogance, insults and infighting, resulting in years of stagnation. I tried to hang on for as long as I could, but there is just no reasoning anymore with this toxic community. As a comparison: I was extremely critical of the Ethereum DAO hard fork and vocalized that criticism a lot in the Ethereum subs. While I also occasionally got shunned, most of the time I was answered with actual argumentation and nuance. Rarely with insults, ad hominem or post/comment removal...
@_date: 2016-02-15 09:06:15
Indeed, but the reality is that full confirmation is rarely required for fast transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:02:40
And all time low BTC dominance as well. Just to put things in perspective...
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:56:51
It's not FUD when it's supported by factual evidence though. I used to believe in the future of Bitcoin and have a lot of respect for its accomplishments, but I just feel it has run its course now.
@_date: 2016-02-15 06:06:57
I heard about that. It's unfortunate that a couple of bad apples can ruin the reputation of this promising technology for some people.
@_date: 2017-04-05 21:06:58
I didn't write that article. Also, did you write that by bashing your face into the keyboard?
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:17:25
So, what credentials make you the better judge?
@_date: 2017-04-04 19:23:36
You'd prefer Bitcoin to be replaced by a shallow copy that hasn't had any innovation for years? It's hard to see the point in that...
@_date: 2017-04-06 21:18:16
Be realistic. Have you seen the Rootstock GitHub? It's vapourware.
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:00:26
Everybody is ;)
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:43:56
Unfortunately PoW is also extremely environmentally unfriendly. And while Bitcoin has worked 'fine' for all these years, it hasn't innovated in the slightest. Quite the double edged sword.
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:06:27
You forgot the dwindling of Bitcoin dominance percentage into the 60's.
@_date: 2017-04-13 00:37:12
Sounds like he'll fit right in then :)
@_date: 2015-04-13 23:45:10
Congratulations on restricting your business to a tiny fraction of the economy!
@_date: 2016-05-24 08:30:03
@_date: 2015-03-23 22:40:40
Because both sides are invested in their beliefs, both emotionally and financially.
@_date: 2016-05-20 08:25:52
And what prevents them from exchanging those coins for other coins?
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:17:25
Investing all in BTC is like investing in a single stock. Do your kids a favour by diversifying. I would personally invest the majority in some bond and stock index ETFs, with the smaller portion in risky, undiversified investments like BTC. I will probably get downvoted like crazy by the blind believers here...
@_date: 2016-05-20 08:48:39
I'd think they're used to it by now.
@_date: 2015-03-26 06:29:30
Because OP is invested and desperately wants to increase the value, as so many posts here. Sad really...
@_date: 2015-02-16 13:17:32
I agree. These people are clearly just preaching their own investment. Going all-in with cryptocurrency is currently just silly.
@_date: 2016-07-11 10:24:33
Care to elaborate that with actual arguments?
@_date: 2016-07-31 16:44:38
Except it often preludes a move in the opposite direction as well. It's not that simple :)
@_date: 2016-05-24 07:53:48
Seeing as it's the countdown to adding ETH to Coinbase and rebranding away from BTC, I don't think that will happen now...
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:48:42
What's probably even worse than this weak joke is the fanboy sheep that idolize him. He's just a human, with strengths and weaknesses. It's impossible to tell whether his intentions are ideological or opportunistic.
@_date: 2016-07-11 10:56:30
Well, technically ETH was never meant to be a currency, even though it happens to be good at that as well. Either way, I'm not an Ethereum prophet and I'm not holding any ETH, but I'm not a Bitcoin maximalist either. I just keep an eye on whatever has promise and traction, and currently that is Bitcoin and Ethereum, for different reasons.
@_date: 2016-07-11 09:17:26
Ethereum is not a scam, but it's going through some intense growing pains currently. I wouldn't buy ETH until that is resolved. BTC is a pretty safe buy and hold still.
@_date: 2015-02-16 13:15:16
It tends to be possible to avoid inheritance tax by gifting instead. But please do yourself a favour and diversify your investments. Putting it all in BTC is crazy risky. Could just as well go to a casino and put it all on red. Don't take investment advice from people that are clearly invested in what they preach...
@_date: 2016-07-17 09:19:47
Nice try.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:29:12
I take it you haven't actually read that article?
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:56:29
I agree on the proof of work being put to an actual purpose, rather than wasting energy on utterly meaningless calculations. That is a pretty fundamental flaw in the current Bitcoin technology.
