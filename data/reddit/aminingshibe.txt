Also they have pests.
Don't go there.

If your coins are on an exchange, you don't own any coin.
Get a wallet. Use it.

A few weeks ago I found 350 thousand... Reddcoins -_-
From my mining days in a wallet.dat file that was lying around.
That's about .035 BTC, better than nothing!

Ethereum is centrally controlled?
@_date: 2018-05-16 18:13:11
This was really good.
Did you make this?

IKR? So much fanboyism in here, it's a bit repugnant.
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:13:42
Thank you :)
Keep them coming!

ITT: so much whoosh
TIL ers  can get butt-hurt so easily. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 19:33:51
Pretty much. Have a point.

Credit where credit is due:

There were many fuckups in the early history of Bitcoin (including the infamous case where an exploiter gave themselves many *billions* of Bitcoins). And the devs intervened.
Ethereum is still very young. It doesn't mean it's centralized.
Edit: [that incident](
@_date: 2018-05-30 21:59:15
Forgetting Bitcoin's [Value overflow incident]( among many other issues back in the days, where devs also had to intervene, would also be delusional.

MtGox is still the  exchange on the planet.
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:23:53
That explains why speaks tons about but not the other way around.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:02:01
I since found out about [that](
Instructive :)

He should say the opposite: reverse psychology!

Not sure where they get their stats from, but I made a test transaction at 10 sat/B and it took... about 48h :|

.0075 are worth 450$ in your area?
Where exactly can I sell BTC for 60000$ a pop?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:40:31
This is the only real answer.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:24:49
[That's my approach to the 'Over 9000' BTC memes](
Blow over 9000, that is ;)
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:44:45
Theoretically, would a transaction with 0 BTC in fees ever get through?
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:46:52
Sold my BCH from the fork at its peak.
With it, bought more BTC at its dip.
BOW TO YOUR GOD.

And 5 units minimum order. Multiply all these by 5.
Especially Hashrate : &gt;

Stay  y'all!

This news would be very similar:
"Satoshi Nakamoto's private keys controlling near 1 million BTC found among late Hal Finney's belongings"
Should we then dump BTC for something else?
Bullions in gold or BTC will be found. They'll dilute their own respective value every time.
