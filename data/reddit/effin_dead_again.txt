Yes! You can even type in your password anywhere on the Internet and it will automatically be hidden!
Password: **********
See?!?! It works!!!

Exactly, not only are there coding changes that need to be done, there are also internal policy changes, such as returns, accounting, etc. that must be done before release, not to mention the marketing team coming up with an announcement campaign, as well as the web/graphics design team creating the bitcoin landing page and other site assets: 
This doesn't even consider bringing in the legal team...

If you've ever bought anything Voice over IP related you've likely either used VoIPSupply or heard of them. Now you can spend your hard earned/mine BTC with them! Disclaimer: I don't work for them and have no affiliation.
EDIT: I do work for Voice over IP software company eZuce, Inc. which develops the open source VoIP software [sipXecs]( (shameless plug :-P )

Same here, got it after about 2 minutes of being logged into Cryptsy today. Thought I had something nasty on my machine so I ran it through the gamut of checks to find nothing...
Glad to know it's not just me.

Tried that already, got a call from the HR director saying they can't do that :-(

Yes. Our company uses it as our expense platform (which costs on a per user basis), but you can use it for free if you're just creating a report for your employer. It's really nifty, can integrate with your credit card, and you can take pictures of your receipts and they'll be uploaded to your report.
No, I don't work for them, I just like the platform.

Privatize the profits, socialize the losses. Welcome to banking!

Expensify is by far the best expense report system I've ever used. The only reason it looks weird is because I whited out some of my company information.

And you're sure it's 64 characters exactly? Methinks you could GPU crack it with some clever scripts in a fair amount of time.

Shows how little I know about cryptography :-)

In an ideal world this would be the case but it's just not realistic to suggest that businesses operate on Bitcoin like that. Almost none of a businesses suppliers, accounting software, etc is ready for Bitcoin so services like Bitpay MUST exist if widespread adoption is to occur.

I had a similar experience with those guys, though it only took a week of no response before a (German language) invoice showed up in my inbox (after I went and bought the item with fiat no less). Tried emailing them 4 times with no response, just glad I didn't get ripped off in the long run from them.
In the end, I actually needed 2 of the item I bought anyway, so it worked out...

What you see as a disadvantage, I see as an advantage.
Because ASICs for scrypt will be inherently more difficult and more expensive to design and create, there will be less interest in doing so and the difficulty rating for Litecoin will remain lower for longer, allowing those that are investing in GPU mining to realize returns on their investments and to turn a bit of a profit.
Bitcoin ASIC mining will eventually lock the little guy out of the game. Litecoin has less chance of this happening as quickly or as cheaply.
