It might surprise some. But being of the group that isn't surprised seems to give you downvotes.. Nah, having a mate who worked at Mt. Gox for a while (lower role, nothing on infrastructure) I chose to steer clear, as I figured if they let him in, even to the level of checking our passports for ID verification and such, then this cookie was bound to crumble eventually..

I'd need to do some research - but at the moment I am assuming the best bet is to buy a few Bitcoins? Not much gain in mining on your own without a good rig (and electricity costs would deduct, I guess) from what I have read up on..

When Bitcoin gained mass media attention, this subreddit took a nosedive in intelligence..

If you do turn out to need anyone on the non-dev side, I'd be in :-) Possibly not, then? Shame, quite interested :)

Not yet, no. There are too few supporters of Bitcoin, and the currency fluctuates too much and scares the American government at the moment. Later, perhaps. I doubt the reserve will buy in for years and years.

Pretty low wage an hour for a job like that, I'd say..
I'd go for the customer service rep if it wasn't for the fact that I am looking for a visa sponsor at the moment (I moved to Japan, have until August to find a job and sponsor).

And you - my apologies for that whizzing over my head. I'll go off to bed now ;-)

I do not have any sources, unfortunately, so my wording may be too confident - but I was pretty sure eBay had a clause or idea to stamp out these kinds of transactions, so they will not have mercy on the "legitimate scammer".

I was considering getting into Bitcoin in January 2012. I have now once again considered, but feel like it's a little late to get on the band-wagon ;)

Never put in more than you are willing to lose. I'd put in these €200 and see if I can get a payout some day. Otherwise I can just say "good I didn't lose the money at the bar". 
Issue with having just moved is that I have a visa card from Europe that I can't use in the country I am in. Perhaps a three day bank transfer would be better, but that just takes quite a while..

Are you hiring in Tokyo? I recently moved to Japan, studied IT Technology, Marketing and Communication and speak advanced Japanese -- need anyone? *hint hint*
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:29:02
So yes, I am in on starting out. I've got about €220 I can spare on the "project/investment", which is around 1.5 BTC. I, however, now need to get "in" on the market, which means getting money into BitCoin. MtGox doesn't directly accept visa, which is the only instant payment service I have. Would I be better off going to another place and buying the coins, or how would I best buy them? I am assuming that buying today vs. Friday might be worth a 3-5% comission fee in any transfer just by the hopeful rise of the value.

Agreed. This could be made in two minutes with MS Paint.
Next time use a better base image, and don't watermark it. IF you wish to, put your name at the bottom corner. If you wish to keep that watermark on, you could make a slight gradient, which will let the lazy people not want to edit it out just due to having to fix the gradient (a simple task for someone with photo editing skills, however).
Either way.. sorry, but just not feeling it, Mr. Hougesen. 
Also, I'd worry about using my name so openly on the Internet at a younger age, but that could just be me.

This, and also if they allowed credit cards it would open a whole new black market for stolen credit cards. Since you can send bitcoins without a bitcoin exchange, you could go to an exchange and use a stolen credit card to buy bitcoins, whereafter you could transfer them anonymously to your wallet off the exchange. Suddenly your money is safe in bitcoins and the stolen credit card can be discarded.
There are more reasons, but this is one example..

It is painful, I know. Back in spring I almost bought 500 dollars worth of bitcoins, but due to my not having a job I figured I'd wait. Now I have a job and can afford to buy.. but at this price, I'd be more afraid of how far down they can go :/
@_date: 2013-05-25 02:28:22
While it is scummy, it is indeed completely legitimate in this case. The person who bids and wins, however, doesn't see it that way, and eBay will usually side with that person.

On another note, do you think the inflation will let us get rid of the 1 JPY coin? It seems so ... unnecessary and I wish we could get rid of it..

Upvotes for Plan B - it's a great show, and covers good topics. Great for audio listeners, but also has bonus for the video viewers.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:50:55
... and I am stuck in the verification queue at Mt Gox so I can get started :P
@_date: 2013-04-08 10:49:38
I doubt I can spare more than 90 dollars at the moment, as I have recently moved across the globe, and still searching for a job.. but it might be enough to get me started, I guess.
