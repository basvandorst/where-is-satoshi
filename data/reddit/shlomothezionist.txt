They should get rid of all that worthless gold and buy Bitcoin, right?
Whatever problem you have, throw some Bitcoin at it and it's solved. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 10:15:37
I think Bitcoin is great but this shit is going way too far. Also if this is what Bitcoin needs to get big then it's fucked in the first place. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 03:48:37
Not before they spam the place with fractions of a cent. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 10:43:12
2 posters in this thread are shadow banned. 
It might just be you. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:10:00
And you fail to see the problem?
@_date: 2014-11-25 04:28:53
Please stop with this childish shit. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:21:06
I didn't follow it. Is actually anybody else besides Bitcoiners talking about it?
@_date: 2014-11-25 10:26:36
Very convincing evidence. Very critical thinking. He must be out of this world for not understanding this. 
You on the other hand seem very rational and stable. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 10:46:33
A picture of a few people at a Bitcoin stand isn't enough evidence for you? Are you out of this world?
@_date: 2014-11-25 09:19:37
Who just keeps downvoting me? Why??
@_date: 2014-11-25 04:06:46
Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 10:25:15
Yeah, so relevant to my comment. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 14:51:59
Streisand effect dude, streisand effect. A term 99% of these fools never heard of before yesterday and still don't understand what it is.

As i suggested in another thread maybe we can spray paint random people in the streets with a Bitcoin logo. 
Spamming cents and harassing a company is so last week. We need something new. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 03:42:44
The guy you are talking to has about 10 fake alts which he uses to manipulate this place. The fact that he accuses normal people of being shills and trolls is either funny as fuck or sad as hell depending on your mood. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 19:41:57
Amazing you haven't been called a paid shill yet. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 12:40:42
Yeah, the only possible option if someone doesn't join the witch hunt against them. Or a paid banker shill of course. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 05:49:44
I really hope my friends and family won't see this. 
I keep trying to explain them how amazing Bitcoin is but this is the shit we have to deal with. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 05:21:33
My guess is nothing. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:29:42
That didn't answer my question. The site mentions a Streisand effect. Is that's what going on or not? Or is it just some Redditor who learned a new fancy word and put it on his blog?
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:50:03
I see learned a new word today. 
It already starting to get cringey. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 05:17:33
If i don't join the circle jerk or think spamming WU is childish i must be a buttcoiner right? Or paid shill maybe? That's how it works here, right?
Let me tell you something. I hold a large amount of coins and want the world to take Bitcoin seriously. This dumb ass shit is something Bitcoin really doesn't need. If only you people were old enough to understand this. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 03:00:28
With Streisand effect they mean a bunch of Bitcoiners circle jerking while the rest of the world doesn't give a shit?
@_date: 2014-11-24 12:30:19
I sure hope everyone will think like you. Which i highly doubt. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 12:02:34
So if you run an electronics store and Bitcoin has become mainstream and you get 5 people a day buying stuff worth several 1000's you'll accept 0 confirmations?
@_date: 2014-11-25 14:10:34
The Streisand effect. A few dozen Bitcoiners jerking off each other while the rest of the world nor WU gives a shit. 
This is easily the dumbest, cringiest and most pathetic circle jerk i have seen here in a long time. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 14:37:37
Wow. Because he didn't adopt Bitcoin because he simply doesn't care about it he deserves some kind of punishment? 
Everytime i think this place hit rock bottom already someone proofs me wrong. 
Every day i'm getting more and more ashamed of being a bitcoiner. The fact that people might asociate me with this stuff makes me want to sell my coins. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 03:08:58
Neither did @_date: 2014-11-25 03:02:08
Are you telling me the "Streisand effect" is just some Bitcoiners circle jerking? Such a thing surely would never happen here?
@_date: 2014-11-25 05:33:21
How did they mess with the Bitcoin community?
@_date: 2014-11-25 16:34:41
There is no Streisand effect you idiot! 2 dozen bitcoiners jerking eachother off is NOT a Streisand effect. It really isn't. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 10:29:01
It's not a camera trick. It's 2 different pictures. 
This must be a troll from someone trying to make fun of this sub. The longer i think about it the more sure i am this post is a troll. The op can't be real. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 13:46:09
Downvoting people on the internet. 
You should think about your life for a minute or 2. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 20:09:42
Of course you don't. This is where they don't care about fake posts. As long as they add to the circle jerk. 
84% upvoted. Well that says a lot about this sub. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 06:14:41
Uh ok. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 06:18:10
Then don't. Nobody is forcing you. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 03:45:18
Are you gonna do anything about who uses a self owned army of fake alts to downvote and attack people and upvote himself?
@_date: 2014-11-24 10:19:09
Hi, i'd like to buy this 200 dollar computer screen and pay with Bitcoin. 
Sure, scan here and send the money. Only 1 confirmation. 
Ok sorry, the new block is a bit slow. Please wait there in the corner. 
Sorry to had you waiting for 30 minutes. Here is your screen. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:57:30
This place reminds me of a kindergarten at the moment where all the kids learned a new word without understanding it really. At least when 4 years old do it it isn't such a cringe fest. Now it is. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 10:05:09
What Streisand effect for gods sake! It's just a bunch of Bitcoiners circle jerking here and on Twitter. Get real!
@_date: 2014-11-25 06:49:36
"“ If you bought $400 worth of bitcoins in July 2010 you'd be worth $2,856,800 today.” ... but nobody would actually buy them ;)"
They know they are wrong yet they hate Bitcoin so much that they don't mind lying. I see this all the time. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:14:55
They sure hate facts here. Crazy. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 03:39:11
There are no signs whatsoever that they want to ban it. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 01:49:31
Personally i'd say someone (or multiple people) is keeping the price down. As has been doing so for a long time.
