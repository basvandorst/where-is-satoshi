I don't know why people are so skeptical. You don't need that much trust if you do an in-person sale using localbitcoins and their mini escrow service. It's like selling a used car.

Well, it's estimated that [&gt;$30 trillion of global wealth today is hidden]( Given the [lengths that people will go to to hide their money]( and given [how easy it is to use BTC to do this]( we might expect that a whole lot of people will buy bitcoin in order to hide the money they made (imagine how Breaking Bad would have gone if Bitcoin had been around).
If 1/30th of today's hidden wealth were to shift to BTC, [each coin would be worth ~$50,000]( Then there's all the other possible uses of it that would increase its value.

Ha, typically urban me forgot about farms ... :) 
Agreed, in general. The larger point was that spending money on Bitcoin with the hope that it will appreciate in value is *much* less economically helpful than spending money to build a factory that makes stuff that people will buy (or, even, spending money to buy a boat). 
On real estate: clearly, if some bit of capital is being constantly put to use (e.g., living in one's home) then it's not sitting idle and being economically unproductive. But real estate as an asset class is only economically helpful to the extent that people pay money to use it. And even then it's not as good as spending money to build a factory or start a company.

The problem is that some kinds of resource allocation are productive, while other aren't. 
Buying a boat that sits in the harbor 350 days a year is economically much less productive than buying a boat that you subsequently rent out and sits in the harbor 0 days a year.
Stocks and bonds allow companies to make things that people buy. Real estate is only economically productive if you rent it out. Bitcoin is as economically productive as a pile of cash sitting in the basement.

Just use this:

The point of failure here is in the pseudo-random number generator. 
The safest approach is to generate the wallet offline using software that has received significant scrutiny from lots of smart people. 
Alternatively, use software that is backed by a party that has lots to lose (e.g., Google, or a big bank).

Do you really believe that?!? 
[Bhutan as a country is happier]( than most others. How has their behavior remotely caused unhappiness elsewhere?

Yeah, too bad they couldn't execute on it.

Stick with the KISS principle.

Yes, that's why we should all be allowed to have nuclear weapons; or biological virus-making kits.
Tools clearly affect what we *can* do, and thereby affect what we do. We are products of the system we live within.

I'm not worried about the cryptographic quality of the PRNG -- the worry here is that the offline wallet generator is programmed to generate predictable private keys.
