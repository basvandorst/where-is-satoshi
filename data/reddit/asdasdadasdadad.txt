1) If you want a service like that, it's going to look like a monopoly, and in essence, BE a monopoly (or oligopoly, duopoly, etc.) Some businesses can only exist as such (telecom, large payment processors, airlines, etc.) It's called a natural monopoly.
And competition doesn't necessarily drop the price, by the way. Aaand, competition can even cause quantity shocks (in the case of currency services, I'd assume this means decreased lending/credit available, especially to higher risk individuals who aren't already sitting on a pile of cash.) In this case bitcoin isn't even competition, though - Visa or Chase could just adopt it into their existing structure and call it a day.

No refunds is bad for the end user, and they drive adoption. You use credit cards for normal purchasing behavior, showing how bitcoin is not as good for the end user, despite your evangelizing for bitcoin in other threads I have seen you in. As a matter of fact, to quote your reply to one of my comments to provide proof you are just in it for the bubble (like most others, I assume), you even showed the pump-and-dump nature of your side of the argument:

It's not some conspiracy, the game isn't rigged like that. They literally just try to capture the majority vote in their stances. Watch [this video]( for the basic idea, super dumbed down.
It's not some chosen agenda for you, it's just that the people that voting SHOULD matter the most for (the young, and in particular the poor) are notoriously non-voting, and those who it shouldn't matter as much for (typically the elderly, as they probably won't even be around to deal with the results of their policies) consistently vote. Thus, the politicians by default don't care about the non-voters, as they're not even trying to get representation. They only care about who votes for them and what those demographics care about. And, it's pretty evident in most policies that that ends up being the case.
Thanks for removing yourself from the voting pool, way to really fix things. Oh yeah, it's some conspiracy, and they just hire strategic firms and spend billions on market and demographic research to make it look legit, not to get legs up on their competition. Right?

Here's the answer:
The claims about bitcoin is that it is so much superior to the current system, that it has nowhere to go but "to the moon". Yet, obviously that is a lie, if you need to rename things in order for it to work. A name? Seriously?
And your butchering of the metric system is enough to piss most people who are familiar with it off a lot. A lot.

No, that's not how median voter theorem supposedly works. It's more like the candidates through polling move toward the center (the median voter) in order to capture as much of the population as possible from each "side". That's why so many national elections are so close, it generally gets pretty close to the median (at least in a two party system, there is further theory suggesting that more than two parties can never reach equilibrium).

Ahh, pump and dump. Now see, THAT certainly makes more sense. If you don't care about something's shortcomings but continue to buy, I question your investment capabilities. I have no financial incentive to see it fail or succeed, and knowing this is how many investors see it (it's the only explanation for the hostility towards anyone questioning any of it), I see no reason to invest, as these are the type of schemes that can drop out at any moment. Entertaining that you guys have come out in full force to attack anyone with questions, just further proves you're trying to sucker people, since you won't answer with any reasonable logic.

Yes, I understand moral hazard. But people only go to jail when they do something explicitly illegal. Since what was done, as far as I know, wasn't illegal, no one goes to jail. Now, if you WANT it to be illegal, you have to pass laws, which will in turn essentially create specific legislation claiming certain activities are illegal, and that's what's called "regulation". And, in this community, regulation is bad, so, there is no solution to it around here.

Well, we would have to define what stupid stuff is, first. But if it means something like, "Not intellectually rewarding, or helping to improve the human condition in the offline world, or helping develop skills useful in the real world", you're going to be looking at a very small fraction of the net. Probably not 99% of the net, but definitely over 80%.
1) Social media, mostly worthless content, or advertising for consumer products. This is twitter, fb, g+, etc
2) Content aggregators. Literally just posting content from somewhere else online.
3) Porn.
4) Meme culture. (These last two I hope I don't have to explain fully as to why they don't advance human knowledge or culture meaningfully, and yes, this is coming from a guy who has watched plenty of porn in his life).
5) Political/news trash sites. Drudge, huffpo, foxnews, mother jones, rt, zerohedge, all of it is mostly half-baked opinion pieces, and even the factual stuff generally has so many errors or assumptions it can hardly be considered factual.
6) The blogosphere. Christ, what a catastrophe most of that is.
7) Content hosting sites. These can be a mixed bag, and often have great content, but it is HARDLY the majority of content. Not even close.

Anyone who knows what a light year is?
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:14:59
Nice edit you did there. Your original reply above was simply "I don't".
Now let us examine this again.
It guarantees no refunds? How is that good for the consumer that buys something, online, and then gets either a crappy or defective product? Worse for the consumer than methods which allows them the capacity to get a refund in the case of a scam or a lie about the product. Once again, no reason for widespread adoption if you expect people to buy bitcoin with the intent of using it. As a matter of fact, you can set this up in the current system by clearly specifying "no refunds" in your return policy.
Buying stuff when you don't trust a merchant with your personal info? If you don't trust them with your info, like any merchant would want (you know, to ship your stuff to you, for instance), why would you send them money? Do you enjoy funding shady merchants who might be involved in a scam?
You use the credit card for everyday purchases. And this is you showing why you, as a consumer and end user, prefer one method of payment over another, thereby proving bitcoin is inferior for the end-user (and the person that drives wide-scale adoption). I'm not talking about hopeful "what-if" scenarios, where it always is said to be "coming in the future", I mean right here, right now, the product advertised as the second coming of the messiah is horrible for end users, and you just admitted it by saying you use the conventional method for your traditional payment method.
So, once again, other than this initial bubble activity, where the price rises every year and people hold on to bitcoin hoping it will be worth more fiat currency in the future, why would it not just stop the rise one day as it has no legitimate use for the end user, and as everyone realizes the only reason it is purchased is in the hopes it will rise in fiat currency value?
@_date: 2014-05-05 18:49:01
Did I know it offhand? No, but it's a simple thing to calculate once you know the speed of light and/or how far light travels in a set amount of time... I wouldn't expect anyone who doesn't work daily with a very large (or small) number to remember it offhand, but I would expect them to understand how to come about it.
A "meter" has been around for far longer than we have known what the distance light travels in a year is. Historically, we have changed our distance units (and other types of units, but most especially distance units) to be more and more precise as we have been able to measure to more precise levels. Long ago, they were lengths of body parts, of distances between notches on wood bars as measured against official, royal bars.
What was once a measurement based off of things that can change length over time (metal bars, distance between points on the earth's surface, etc), you now can easily say "well, the distance known as a meter is some fraction of a light year", where a light year has been defined as the distance light travels in a year. Which actually becomes a circular reasoning, and relied on some authority laying out what the units used are.
But once that happens, it's sort of set in stone forever, as long as something constant like the speed of light is used. Another common way of measuring things (such as time units) would be to compare them to atom/crystal vibrations and such.

How do murderers still murder people?
Regulation isn't omnipotent, it only serves to make things prohibitively expensive. If something is obscenely profitable, it might make more sense to ignore regulations and try it.
Think about it this way: If normal business gives me $10 million/yr, and money laundering gives me $20 million/yr, it wouldn't make sense to engage in laundering activities if, say, I had a 50/50 chance of being busted within a year's time and it would cost me $20 million in fines overall. Now, any combination of increasing the fine or chance of being caught makes it less profitable from a risk-neutral stance. If you assume risk aversion, you can get away with a small fine and chance in order to dissuade laundering.
Of course, I am not saying the executives of the banks are laundering the money. They're just trying to steer a huge financial behemoth, and is probably in THEIR best interest to not get involved with that stuff, since they can make an obscene amount of money the old fashioned way (inside information about good investments, etc.) But plenty of people in the chain might make an attempt at it, as well as people simply using the service from the outside.
It's not like banks are some single-minded entity.

Unless the marginal economic gain from a printed dollar per individual is greater than the marginal economic loss from a printed dollar per individual, which would be a gain and not a theft.
EDIT: Since I am sure this needs clarification here:
If one printed dollar costs the average individual $0.01 (by actually devaluing their dollar as more dollars chase the same amount of goods), and one printed dollar gives a $0.011 benefit to the average individual (by allowing more money to exist and the various benefits of that, such as increased trade, services, infrastructure, investments, whatever), then it is a benefit to society as a whole and every individual within it to print that dollar.
EDITEDIT: Also like how I got a reply to this and it was deleted, after I typed up a wonderful reply. While I forgot to copy the text of the original reply, my response was:
The point is, if the marginal benefit of the "printing" of dollars is greater than the marginal cost due to inflation, then there has been an overall net economic gain, and there are many arguments made towards why doing it this way IS a net economic gain - a relatively stable currency value being the main reason.
Also, the "printing" of the dollars goes to banks, which people loan from (simplifying the situation, of course). There are some individuals and organizations that may borrow more than others (large corporations, the rich intending to invest in profitable activities), but everyone has some amount of access to the money (homes are bought through mortgages, small businesses are started with SBA loans, etc).
I'm not defending the practice, per se, but I am not going to just write it off. You couldn't possibly just "print" money and then literally give it to everyone in the country, that would be an administrative nightmare. Thus, you have to start somewhere, and that starts at banks, as they are essentially the interface between the public (fiscal, monetary) and private (consumer, corporate) sectors, at least concerning money.

I'd say, at least in the developed West, you have a HUGE argument to make that this is the case. Pre-internet, if I wanted to learn something, I could easily travel to one location where I KNEW there was knowledge - a library. Within this library, most non-fictional topics were covered in great detail.
Post-internet, we make the claim that there is all of this knowledge easily available to us, but ACTUAL knowledge available on the internet is still mostly superficial (see: almost all blogs on just about anything, where they are little more than filler content to hold referral links so the author can get paid), and the signal-to-noise ratio is absolutely pathetic. Finding ACTUAL knowledge has actually become even MORE difficult, as so much semi-knowledge and pseudo-knowledge easily masquerades as real knowledge, especially to the uninformed who don't know any better.

A short thought exercise:
The people who get PhD's in economics, who try to maintain a stable money supply and prevent inflation as the monetary supply they control would collapse in the face of too much of it (thereby removing their "power" and "job" and making them look like idiots to the world), don't understand economics, and you are a member of some elite few people who have done nothing in the field yet understand it better than they do and are right that deflation would be a benefit to the overall economy (this one weird tip would save the world economy!), or
You are wrong, and deflation would wreck the economy, and you are a proponent of a brand of economics that is only accepted in the blogosphere which happens to be full of armchair economists who know nothing about the field except for what they were sold by other "homeopathic" economists.

Median voter theorem suggests that, if all parties educate themselves on the topics, all parties voting will result in the median voter's desires being achieved (in a two party system).
To just not vote is only appropriate if you absolutely don't care about the topic at hand, due to your potential ignorance or lack of concern swaying the vote away from the median voter.
If you actually care, are educated, and never vote, you sway the vote away from the actual median voter's choices (and not in your favor, either).
You're not sending any "signal" to anyone if you don't vote, other than the signal that you don't care, and if your demographic doesn't care, it will never be represented by any of the parties who attempt gaining favor with the public.

"Random" word method is horrible, because the words aren't random, they're human generated and probably from a fairly small set of relatively common words (because they have to be remembered by the person). Unless you use a word generator, but most people won't. They'll just think, hmm, "horse, battery, ..."
And the graph in that link is misleading, in a sense - you'll notice that 4 words from a 500k word bank is about 80 bits of entropy, while the numbers of characters that would be the equivalent to it would be represented further right on the graph (and with higher bits of entropy, as a matter of fact, much higher). 30 characters that are represented by 4 words is far worse than 30 characters that are purely random.

Oh, then you certainly are aware that Mr. Rockwell is taking a great liberty by saying that it is a known fact that this quote is about voting, and that is in no way a verified context for the quote? Other interpretations include: A warning not to consider the votes of a populace to mean it actually is reality, a warning to not vote, a warning to not get tied up in the political process, and an actual warning against eating beans. I'm sure there are more.
Trolls spouting more half- and semi-truths I see. Keep up the good work, I guess.

Oh I see you missed the first words of my post. Carry on, then. EDIT: Also, I would like you to define what "disproportionate amounts of time" is. Only takes a few minutes to scan the headlines and comment on appropriate ones and/or comments nested under them. You guys act like it's some chore to hop on a content aggregator and type words. Also, I'm very interested in [these types of situations]( regardless of the topic they cover.

This from the guy that brought you the highly-thought-out and absolutely-not-juvenile-in-any-way idea that [voting is a waste of time]( which is actually just a self-fulfilling prophecy - if no one votes because it is a waste of time, then the voting process is pointless because it doesn't accurately reflect the desires of the [median voter]( within the population.
I'll pass on his other work if this is the type of thinking that goes into it.

Uhhhhh, a lot of people in the treasury, including the top spots, have many ties and experience in the banking sector.

Yeah, no, I live in a city, and I am fairly liberal in my views, but people like you who can't even type and make assumptions (trolls) get upvoted around here, and I get called a troll regularly.
This place is a nuthouse. Lemme know how your little "homeless tribe" works out. Actually, nevermind. Don't.

...because they provide a service used by millions (billions?) and are paid for it? Do you think that businesses that have millions (billions?) of people as clients wouldn't be paid billions every year? The least risky form of investment is investing current capabilities towards something other people will pay you for.

No, I am trying to tell you, I WAS someone interested in the technology that is bitcoin, and then I was called a troll when I brought up clear problems with the logic presented to me. Apparently you think one person has the time to go around constantly harassing you people, when it really is just your shitty attitudes and lack of forethought in your arguments creating (probably) many, many people who now take issue with you and continue to question your logic or motives.
You lose a lot of possible supporters that way, through your own issues with your (as mentioned above) echo chamber. There are 7bn people on the planet, and not all of them think exactly like you, and a significant MAJORITY are not anarcho-capitalists. You guys have probably alienated far more people than you can imagine with the way you communicate and/or your paranoia and/or persecution complexes. Good luck.

Welcome to where any inflation is hyperinflation, and any deflation is profit.

Define a "long passphrase", and if you could, explain to me, is the passphrase just random words, or letters/numbers/text/symbols?
@_date: 2014-04-29 03:10:07
An acronym doesn't help at all.

I am curious, how do developers know what "the community" wants, anyway?

A war debt is a debt one country must pay to another country after losing a war.
In the case of Germany, they eventually did revolt. That's LITERALLY how Hitler came to power.
I love this theoretical "there will be no war in a bitcoin world" ideal. Hilariously out of touch with reality. There will never not be war, because people that can wage war can wage it.

You showed me that obviously the feds know it is a problem, and they are underfunded, and they don't have the tools needed to get people actually doing fraud, and they make a good effort at it. But other than that, I don't get your point. Of course people get away with fraud, they also get away with murder, and there are plenty of people trying to stop them, and sometimes, they even catch them.

Pre-war, they took massive loans to pay for war spending. Post-war, they were in debt to winning countries as well as continuing debt spending (and then they helped hyper-inflate their economy due to monetary policy).
