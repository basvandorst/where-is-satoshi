Is this true? I have read that it is not and I have also read that it is. If it is true, do you know how that works? Is there some kind of timeout function or does it need to be dropped by x amount of mempools or something else?

Hey dude!!! Picked up some REALLY useful info for you.  Takes new requests at the beginning of each hour. I waited to submit my transaction number until the top of the hour and it was accepted. So right around when the hour is about to turn, start submitting until you get in.
I dug for a long time to find this info...days...if anyone in the future should see fit to throw a tip my way, I would be grateful.

Said the Keynesian Economist. Didn't George W. Bush say something like this after 9/11? How did that turn out?

I just recently rediscovered that I have some BTC I forgot about from 2013. I have a couple Raspberry Pi's, but I don't know why running a node is important. Can you share some info?
