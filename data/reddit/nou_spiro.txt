TOR itself is secure. What is less secure are browsers which use them as they may leak information which can lead to real IP.

Hi are there some proposal how to solve evergrowing blockchain size?
@_date: 2019-07-19 19:28:56
Yes but it is problem of scalability. You can run node in prune mode but it would be nice have better solution than that.

you can get exploited and have keylogger installed. even if you close this security hole this keyloger will stay there. so no you are not safe.

2048 possible words is exactly 11 bit of information. 24 of them makes 264 bit of information which is enough.

In Slovakia it is 20% income tax. Then 14% social and pension insurance tax. So you pay 1/3 of any income to state.

Another issue with your idea. How do you sell this "pure" bitcoins? Each transfer will diminish their value considerably. I think unlikely this will happens.

So total debt generated this way is equal to sum 0.97^n for n from 0 to infinity. Which converge at 33.333.

I have instaled bitcoind from this PPA  on my Linux box and it keeps crashing. Anyone knows if I should switch to other source?
With 0.12 it was running fine but after upgrade it got stuck on one block and didn't sync up. So I run it with -reindex option and then it corrupted saved blockchain and it keep segfault.

You need eat, you need live somewhere so you will spend money. Average Joe doesn't think about inflation so he would not think about deflation too. It could mean less consuming which could save resources which could be ecological. Inflation is good for debt and because world is trillions of dollar in debt everyone wan't inflation because it lowers their debt.
