30,000 BTC is now coming on the market - supply is increasing.  The crazy thing is ulbrich (DPR) bitcoins were also moved today, but they aren't up for sale (yet).  that's another 144,000 bitcoin.  If you think this drop is bad, wait till that case is finished and those coins come on the market. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:26:45
my spec is 525.

I agree this is the model.  But lets say that PayPal starts letting you purchase and store bitcoin in your paypal account (a la Coinbase) would you use that service?
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:42:30
LOL or maybe not - 595 right now.  what a crazy ride today is.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:31:03
I think we'll see 400s tonight, I just think it will rebound by July 1.  Good call though.

with the auction being in blocks of 3000BTC I'm guessing you're right as average investors are not going to put up ~1.5M needed to purchase the coins (at market price).  It may be a good deal for companies or institutional investors to get their hands on a good bit of BTC at a good price.
I have to disagree that this somehow legitimizes bitcoin, if anything it shows that it's volatility is probably too high for most people's taste, and also shows that the BTC market is pretty easily manipulated.  Those are red flags for the big boys who's involvement is really needed for BTC to see prime time.  I'm not saying it's not coming, it's just not "right around the bend."
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:45:51
absolutely correct.

I hate that it connects to facebook to verify your account, but dems da breaks when you're getting free stuff.
seems like this is very similar to ripple.

not sure if you think this is some type of type of conspiracy or something, and sure this is not "bitcoin" -&gt; but just thought that this community would be somewhat interested in this.
best news of the day is the up from the $570 low yesterday -&gt; wish I had been online and buying.

If you get a chance - travel dude.  The world is an amazing place.  The things we read and hear about in the news makes it seem like anywhere outside of our boarders is a dangerous place to live in.  I've been lucky enough to have traveled around the world, including twice to Bali.  It's an amazing place with amazing people.  Some horrific things have happened there (there was a nightclub bombing several years ago) - but the same can be said of Oklahoma City or New York (both more dangerous than Bali IMO).

Yes, blockchain confirmed movement on DPR's BTC indicates that they do have the private keys.

Could a control analysis be done on a similarly sized subreddit (subscribers/posts/comment volume) where vote manipulation is not believed to be occurring?  This would give good insight to how anomalous this data set is.

I enjoyed fight club the first, second, and third times I watched it.  I'm enjoying watching it a fourth time now.
@_date: 2015-07-23 08:39:46
That will cost extra.

it truly is the greatest gift.

Where were you in 4th grade when I was handing in my homework? so many red marks could have been avoided.

Your/you're problem with my original post

Dear my lovely children,
I told you Santa was real. You did not believe me enough and you questioned my integrity by staying up late and waiting to see him come down the chimney and eat some cookies.  Yes you did see me putting out the presents and drinking the milk - but Santa was there the whole time, just waiting in the other room. I could have introduced you but I was too butt hurt to introduce you and now you're on santa's permanent naughty list, so he probably isn't coming back now. So merry Christmas.
and a happy new year. 
edit: you guys!!! :-)

I'm not affiliated with them in any way, but I really highly recommend 
They can automatically import transactions from the major exchanges and then find the best method for minimizing your capital gains tax burden - they calculate FIFO, Average Cost, LIFO, Highest Cost First-Out, Highest Price First-Out, Lowest Cost First-Out, Lowest Price First-Out, &amp; Closest Cost First-Out.
It's free with some limits (I think it's some limited # of transactions) and then it's $20 for premium for any tax year. In the premium (I'm not sure if it's available in the free one) they also export files that can import everything into turbotax (and I don't know which other tax programs). 
I've used three years in a row and really happy with it - I thought I'd be spending days working on my Bitcoin taxes, takes about an hour with this tool. 
Also if you've been trading on foreign exchanges and have ever had more than 10k in cash and/or coins you need to file an FBAR - you can get seriously raped in the dickhole if you fail to file the FBAR, even if it's purely a mistake/lack of knowledge.
