Kraken ist the least scammy exchange in my opinion, because even if they do experience a lot of problems, they are perfectly upfront and transparent about them. Look at how opaque the other major exchanges are in comparison, I mean bitfinex doesn't even have a physical address.
Also, don't forget that a lot of problems of this sort are not the fault of Kraken but of the archaic and inefficient US banking system. You never hear these kinds of complaints from the European Kraken customers.  If Kraken was stalling, why would they only be stalling their US customers?

Bitcoin-QT and its predecessors were *never* user friendly. Even back in 2009,2010,2011 when the blockchain was still small. It always took a very long time to catch up with the blockchain both on installation and after not using the client for a couple of weeks.  That was always a much bigger issue in my opinion than disk consumption.  
So Bitcoin0.x was never really fit for regular Joe.  
It may have been an issue for you, but most people I know don't know or care how much disk space their programs are using up, except the ones who run out of disk space.

You are confusing two independent issues
Engineering decisions (*how* bitcoin should achieve its goals).  
Stategy decisions (*what* goals bitcoin should achieve).
The aim of Bitcoin isn't perfect democracy or perfect decentralization for it's own sake, and never has been.
The aim is to create a functioning cryptocurrency that has practical, actual uses for millions of people.  Let's not forget that. Bitcoin needs to be anti-fragile, yes, but it also needs to be scalable and user-friendly. Bitcoin has always settled the compromise of "good enough" decentralization.
Mike is calling for Gavin to dictate pure *engineering* decisions, because sometimes that is only way to get out of deadlock. It's what Satoshi used to do anyhow, so it's not as controversial as it sounds.
In any case, it's more of a focal point than a dictat because it will only catch on if a large fraction of the bitcoin community installs the forked client.

It's not as silly as it sounds. If capital controls are imposed, a Euro on a German bank account will be worth more than a Euro on a Greek bank account. They will effectively split into two different currencies, Greek-Euro, and non-Greek-Euro.
It wouldn't surprise me if an unofficial "exchange rate" developed on the black market where, for example, people transfer 1000 Euros to a Greek account and get 500 Euros transferred to their relatives' account in Germany.

I disagree. Yes, the technical details don't matter but people should have a basic *conceptual* understanding of the underlying cryptography. It's really important in terms of empowering people to "be their own bank".  There is no way around it unfortunately.
For example, it is not obvious to many people that they must not hold the private key of paper wallet in front of a webcam. It is trivially obvious if you have a basic understanding of what a private key does. 
The internet is actually a good example of how NOT to do it.  Lots of asinine and nonsensical laws have been written precisely because neither politicians nor the general public understands how the internet works, not even on a conceptual level.

This discussion lacks levelheadedness. 
Is Bitcoin a panacea for Greece's economic problems? No.
Can Bitcoin help certain people, in certain situations? Can it make it a little bit easier for some Greeks to cope with the economic problems? Certainly.
That is how we should we should sell it. Underpromise and overdeliver. 
Organic growth, slowly nibbling inwards at the long end of the tail, step by step, solving one practical problem at the time.  That is how bitcoin will succeed. 
Bubbles and hype, that is how bitcoin will fail.

It takes 6 MONTHS for a credit card transaction to be "verified". Before that time, it can be reversed or frozen for relatively trivial or vague reasons.
So if we are talking about actual hard money (ie. money that I am certain I own) then bitcoin transactions are orders of magnitude faster than credit card transactions.

The debate doesn't freak me out. There are tradeoffs, so in the end people's stance will depend on their ideology and personality more than their technical knowledge.

Most legal systems in the world still place a high importance on the concept of **mens rea**.
I think it is unlikely that someone would be *individually* prosecuted for:
1-Storing a small chunk of a pirated movie file.
2-Which they had no intention of storing.
3-Which they had no knowledge of storing.
4-For which it was technically impossible to attain this knowledge, because they are not in control of the private key.
5-Which cannot, on its own, be used to recreate the actual movie, not even a small excerpt. 
 
Also, a successful prosecution, even of *a single file*, would need to involve an international effort with search warrants in multiple jurisdictions.  A *single file collection* would require hundreds if not thousands of search warrants in dozens of countries.  Will prosecutors really be bothered to go to these lengths when they have much lower hanging fruit to pick?
What is more likely to happen is regulation of Storj, and insertion of a feature giving the authorities the capability of removing illegal files from the network.

It's to do with risk. There is no working exchange in the UK, so the main route is localbitcoins. 
In a bitcoin trade, it is the seller that is exposed to most of the counterparty risk.
Selling on localbitcoins is riskier than selling on bitstamp. It is more likely that one of the buyers will attempt to reverse the bank transfer, or to purchase BTC using a stolen bank account, since they have a) more anonymity and b) less of a reputation to lose than bitstamp.
Hence, people are only prepared to sell on localbitcoins if they get a risk premium over bitstamp.

Consumer protection laws, chargeback, etc. are not free. They create costs for merchants.  Those costs are passed on to the consumers one way or another.  Since the costs are passed on indiscriminately, most consumers don't notice them, and that's why they think they are getting such a good deal with these laws.  
Worse, consumers are forced to pay these costs even when they don't need the protection, for instance when they are acquainted with the merchant. 
Even worse, consumer protection laws create a moral hazard, ie. many consumers take excessive risks that they would not have taken in absence of these laws, because they know they will always be bailed out.  Other consumers take advantage of these laws. This makes products more expensive across the board.
It is a popular notion that merchants are greedy by default and consumers good natured by default and that is why it's the consumers that need protecting.  In a real market however, everyone is greedy.  There are no good guys and bad guys, only an equilibrium. Change the rules in favor of the consumers, and all you achieve is a shifting of the equilibrium, not a a real advantage for the consumers. There is no free lunch.

Because they don't expect to incur a loss, as with any other asset.  
Nobody buys stocks because they expect the price of stocks to fall. Same applies to bitcoin.
If you decide to hold your savings in Bitcoin, then it's because you are expecting Bitcoin to gain value or at least hold its value. If it does hold its value, and you spend your Bitcoins savings again, you incur ZERO net transfer loss.
Also, what do you mean by "have to buy it"?
Nobody is forcing you to hold your savings in bitcoin. If you really expect bitcoin to lose value, then hold litecoin or silver or apple stock or whatever.  
BTW, you do realize that even in the present world most people do not keep most of their savings in cash?  So why do you expect bitcoin to be any different? It would only ever be a small part of a typical portfolio.

Have any of you naysayers heard about **SpaceMonkey**?
The concept is very similar to Storj. The main difference is that the software is closed source and centrally controlled. But the network itself is a p2p network and it faces exactly the same performance/availability/topology issues that Storj would face. 
It is still early days, but so far, SpaceMonkey has been a technical as well as a business success.  Thousands of people around the world are already using it.  The storage cost is about 10x cheaper than Dropbox.
To me, SpaceMonkey is empirical proof that Storj has the potential to tackle the technical challenges and give Dropbox a run for its money.
They only real obstacle still in the way of Storj is preventing Sybil attacks, which SpaceMonkey has solved by centralizing identity management.  But I am fairly confident that some variation of smart contracts will take care of this eventually. See Vitalik Buterin's article on "Identity Corp".

Erasure coding in data centers is only effective against individual hard disk failures. It is useless when the entire data center goes offline.
If you use erasure coding in a p2p network, you split your file into 100 chunks which are stored by 300 independent nodes.  You only lose your data if 200 out of those 300 nodes go offline. As long as 100 nodes - *any* 100 nodes - remain online, you can still retrieve your data.  If a system like Storj uses a rating system as an incentive for running high quality nodes, I would not expect more than a few % of the nodes to be offline at any one time.
Also, you are free to choose any other redundancy ratio, say 1:10, or even 1:1000, if you are willing to pay for it.  For small but highly valuable files this would certainly be worthwhile. 
As for bankruptcy, yes Dropbox could give an advance warning but they are in no way obliged to do this. In fact, they have a strong incentive NOT to give an advance warning, since it would ruin investor confidence and "seal their fate" at a stage where they are still trying to avoid bankruptcy. History shows that some bankruptcies are controlled, others are messy.  Take your chances if you wish.

Most people in most developed nations have a huge amount of savings. I am not talking about their bank accounts.  I am talking about "hidden savings" in the form of corporate pension plans, state pensions and other obligations they can claim from the state once they retire.
Therefore, deflation would benefit almost everyone except for the state. This is the true reason why the state is so keen on creating (moderate) inflation. It is an easy way of shafting future pensioners, and most of them are too numerically/economically illiterate to notice.
It is interesting that Switzerland is one of the few countries where the state pension is not based on a "generational contract".

Regulations are what *caused* this thing.  Excessive regulation that is biased towards large institutions, makes it almost impossible to open a startup in the currency exchange business. 
If you have been around the bitcoin ecosystem since the beginning, you probably noticed that there were a lot of attempts to open exchanges by talented, experienced, hard working people with good business plans. Most of these attempts were brutally quashed by regulators, driving all the good people to pursue other types of ventures. Tradehill is the most prominent example.
The only people that remained were the dishonest and the reckless (Mark Karpeles was probably more of the latter to begin with, but then he dug himself into a hole and also become the former). Lacking proper competition from more competent and properly audited exchanges, mtgox was allowed to run wild.  Nobody used mtgox because they offered a good service, in fact most customers hated mtgox ever since 2011.  People used them because there was no other alternative.
There is nothing wrong with regulation as long as it is voluntary.  People should be able to act in a protected market if that is what they want but they also should be able to trade in unregulated exchanges if they are willing to accept the risk. 
When it comes to pioneer territory like cryptocurrency, a higher lever of risk is a given and people who join this game are well aware of that. That’s why mandatory regulation is particularly destructive in this sector.

100% data integrity? Dream on.
Dropbox offers a false sense of security.
If Dropbox goes bankrupt, the data is gone.
If Dropbox is subject to a hostile takeover, the data is gone. 
If Dropbox becomes the victim of a Megaupload-style shut down, the data is gone.
If you store "bathtub baby pictures" on your Dropbox, that don't conform to puritan American morality, you risk having your account seized and the all data is gone.  
If Dropbox data centers are destroyed by a major natural catastrophe, the data is gone.
If Dropbox data centers are destroyed by civil unrest, the data is gone.
A global, p2p storage system based on open standards is potentially far more secure and resilient than a Dropbox-like system.  If Dropbox fails, it fails suddenly and without warning. If Storj fails, it fails gradually. It could even survive major catastrophic events such as WW3, where it might become very expensive, but not impossible to retrieve your data.
Also, 3x redundancy in p2p environments is *better* than 3x redundancy in data centers if you use **erasure coding**.

No, we can't know that.  And in a way, the price was "real" because a lot of legitimate trades did happen at that price, also outside mtgox.  
The price of a currency is driven by psychology, and a lot of people reified the fake mtgox price because they believed mtgox was trustworthy.  
Ironically, this is not different to what happens with central banks and fiat.  Even if the banks sell fiat that they don't actually own, if enough people believe that they do own it, then the system can keep going for a very long time without collapsing.

I am not even a libertarian, but I don't understand why so many people are so keen on getting a state marriage. The whole concept is just creepy. Why would anyone voluntarily give some faceless bureaucrat the power of defining the terms of something as private and intimate as a relationship?
 
Taxes you can't escape from, but state marriage is *voluntary*, yet even highly intelligent people seem to fall for it without any critical though. That makes it even creepier. 
True, there are some practical advantages to state marriage, but they are minor compared to the cost.  It is basically a blank check contract that turns your relationship into a public good at the whim of social engineers.  Most things that are covered by state marriage can also be covered by private agreements, so there is really no need for it.

I think a similar thing will happen to Cryptocurrencies. The raw protocol is too difficult to use for average people.

I lost about 500 USD. I had put in an order at 33 USD/BTC hoping to catch a flash crash like the one in 2011. It was a calculated risk, so I'm not too bothered about this loss.  
Back in 2012, 5000 USD was about the maximum I felt comfortable leaving as a long term mtgox balance. But with all of their problems and incompetence, this number steadily declined to 500 USD.
After withdrawal delays started in June 2013, I could not sleep at night until most of my mtgox balance was safely converted back to BTC. I don't unterstand how people with significant balances could.

As for:
Conversion: 
Yes, it's hard to buy bitcoin but you only need to do it from time to time, not every time you purchase something.
Volatility: 
Not necessarily a disadvantage since the price of bitcoin could go up as much as down.  If you only keep a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin for small purchases, you will never lose more than you would lose on lottery tickets or some high risk stock.
Miner's fee: 
Many credit cards charge a monthly fee. Pre-paid credit cards charge a horrendous transaction fee of 1%. Most charge conversion fees of 2-3% when buying in a foreign currency. The cards that don't charge any fees usually have hidden costs such as requiring a minimum balance on your bank account.

Indeed, we wouldn't need to legislate speed limits if cars were self driving and designed to always drive at a safe speed.

This argument only applies to bitcoin if you use it  as a store of value. 
It does not apply to bitcoin as a medium of exchange. If you sell your house for a bitcoin and use that bitcoin to buy another house of the same value, the amount of net wealth transferred from you to an early adopter is ZERO.  In fact, you gain wealth if bitcoin lowers your transactions cost.
Also, this argument applies to **any** asset, not  just bitcoin. The majority of commodities, stocks, and real estate in the world are held by a wealthy minority. Why would the people in emerging economies part with their hard earned cash and buy any of those assets as a store-of-value? Why would they voluntarily transfer wealth to people who already own gold, for instance?
Well, it turns out that this is exactly what they are doing.

Bitcoin is still has a long way to go become easy, but credit cards are not THAT easy either, especially outside America.
Here are some examples of my experience with CCs:
1) I had my identity stolen once and an unauthorized charge of $200 made on my credit card.  I had to spend about a total of one hour making phone calls to call centers to get it fixed. What a headache for something which was the CC company's fault. I fucking hate call centers. The most inefficient form of communication ever.
2) My favorite electronics store charges a 3% surcharge for using CC compared to cash.
3) Many airlines charge a $10 surcharge for paying by CC.
4) I tried to get a CC when I was living in the Netherlands. My application was rejected because I was deemed "high risk", even though I had a stable job with an above average salary. They told me I had to wait 2 years until I was eligible!
5) Many smaller online stores don't accept foreign credit cards because they had huge issues with fraud.
6) When you are traveling in a slightly less developed country, they don't work half of the time.
7) I bought a bus ticked via a phone app the other day. The ticked cost about $2. The total credit card fees were another $2 because of currency conversion. The ticked effectively doubled in price!
The point is, credit cards work fine for some people but not for others. In some parts of Europe vast numbers of people don't even have a CC.
There are a lot of applications on the long tail were bitcoin really would offer practical advantages over credit cards, and it is slowly making inroads towards the shorter end of the tail.

Localbitcoins price is higher since the risk for the seller is higher than on a large exchange. For a buyer the risk is roughly the same though, so there are only two good reasons to buy @ localbitcoins:
* You want to be more anonymous and buy from someone who doesn't require ID verification (those sellers normally charge higher prices)
* Moving cash into an exchange is very difficult or costly in your country.
For large volumes I would recommend a large exchange such as bitstamp. You will be required to go through privacy-invading KYC/AML checks though.

I don't see how it does. 
If the Bitcoin supply doubles but the quantity of Bitcoins you own *also* doubles (because you'll be able to spend your pre-fork coins on both chains), then *effectively* the supply hasn't changed at all. 
If I currently own 0.01% of all bitcoins that will ever exist, I will *still* own 0.01% of all bitcoins that will ever exist, even after bitcoin splits into 100 different sub-currencies.

* An infinite hash rate would break bitcoin because it would mean an infinite transaction fee.
* A zero hash rate would also break bitcoin because it would make mean frequent double spending attacks.
* From this it follows that somewhere between zero and infinite, there is an **optimum hash rate** that is just high enough to bring the rate of double spending attacks down to zero, but no higher.
* We are currently not even trying to achieve this optimum hash rate. Instead, the hash rate is more or less arbitrarily determined from 3 parameters:  block reward, block size, and bitcoin price.
* We have no clue how close the current hash rate it is to the optimum, but given that a double spending attack has never occurred we are likely far above it.
* If there is a high risk of an attack, the optimum can further be brought down by implementing additional PoS-like safeguards.
* If follows that the miners are overproducing the public good that is hashrate.  Most miners are thus superflous. Jihan Wu is certainly a net negative.

Yes, definitely, but I don't see it happening soon even if it's proven to be secure and reliable. There is too much dogmatism in the bitcoin community, and PoW is considered "sacred", end of discussion. 
Mark my words though: In the longer term, if bitcoin ever becomes mainstream and reaches prices in the 10,000+ range, a hard fork to PoS is almost guaranteed to happen sooner or later. Bitcoin would consume far more energy than necessary, and the environmental impact of bitcoin would become such a contentious issue that it would motivate most holders to switch to a PoS fork.

It doesn't matter WHY he would do it. All that matters is that he CAN do it. If the entire security of bitcoin relies on a single actor not doing a double spend attack, then bitcoin is no longer trustless. 
One basic premise of bitcoin is that miners have a profit motive. That works well as long as there is large number of miners because even if some miners don't have a profit motive, they are likely to be a minority. But this breaks down when there is a single dominant miner, because then you are **depending on him having a profit motive with 100% certainty, 100% of the time**.
@_date: 2017-03-22 06:13:20
What I'm getting at is that miners "deserve" a smaller reward than they are getting right now.
Precisely because we do NOT have a supply/demand equilibrium. Hashrate per dollar worth of savings is artificially locked in by a couple of fixed parameters. There currently is no way for the market to signal to miners to produce more or less hashrate per dollar of savings.

You have a good point; I never though about it that way. 
One could also argue that **code=law** though. The whole value proposition of bitcoin is that you don't need to rely on the messy and inefficient legal system because you can rely on the clean and immutable block chain. If we need to use old-fashioned physical force to prevent miners from acting maliciously, then why do we need a block chain at all?  
To me, the only answer is to improve the protocol. We can do better. Bitcoin's incentive structure is actually pretty primitive compared to the cutting edge research that is happening in altcoins (eg. Polkadot). 
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:27:44
Mining is a means, not an end in itself. The sole purpose of mining is to make it expensive for an attacker to double spend. A chain secured by Keccak in addition to SHA256 is just as expensive to attack as the current chain. 
Again, let's ask ourselves, what is bitcoin's purpose: To maximize mining profits or to maximize utility for users? If preventing (some) miners from mining (some) of the block rewards leads to a better, faster, more secure, more censorship resistan bitcoin, then why is that a problem?

There are plenty of HODLers who don't care about volatility risk because they will hodl on to their bitcoin no matter what. I'm sure they can provide enough capital to back LN infrastructure. The opportunity to earn some interest on their HODLings will incentivize them nicely.


The nice thing about interest opportunity cost is that it's proportional to the transaction amount and has no lower bound, unlike on-chain transactions. Yes, in relative terms it increases fees but not in absolute terms. Small transactions will still be much cheaper than they are now even if they pay a higher *percentage* tx fee.

Does it though? Satoshi chose SHA-256 because it was ~~all that was~~ the best available at the time, not because it has the best properties for block chain hashing. 
There is nothing sacred about SHA-256; if Satoshi had had the time and manpower to develop his own hashing function he would probably have chosen something different.
A lot of knowledge has been gained in the last 8 years, and Bitcoin must be allowed to innovate, otherwise it will stagnate and be overtaken by altcoins who are not afraid to switch to newer, better hashing functions.

An empty block attack is not coercion in a strict sense though  - it is simply playing by the rules defined by the protocol, which every bitcoin user has voluntarily accepted as valid.

We cannot blame miners for acting in rational self-interest.
However, if that rational self-interest is to prevent massive macroeconomic gains at the expense of small microeconomic gains, then the incentive structure of bitcoin is broken.
We need to fix the incentive structure and we need to fix it fast. If the innovation blockade continues for another year or two, other coins will catch up leave bitcoin in the dust. While we are in a standoff with miners who have too much power, other coins who have a healthier power balance are innovating at a staggering rate.

I think it's prudent to assume that Jihan intends to do a double spending attack, based on his behaviour.

Why are people so dogmatic about what particular PoW function bitcoin uses? It's a technical detail and it doesn't change the essence of bitcoin. A chain using Scrypt is equally secure as a chain using SHA-256, assuming the miner's reward is the same.

If I understand correctly, we need at least 33% hashrate to be resistant against a BU empty block attack.
That means that BU has to devote &gt;33% to secretly mining the empty block chain, while devoting &lt;33% to the BU chain which would then become the shorter chain and be discarded in favor of the Core chain.
(of course that is assuming that the BU front doesn't have a lot of inactive mining capacity hidden away somewhere - which would mean constant economic losses for them)

I disagree. If bitcoin is economically wiped out by BU's 51% attack, then some altcoin that is more resistant to that kind of attack will take bitcoin's place.
The probability of this happening is small but not zero.
Therefore it's perfectly rational for a bitcoin holder to hedge against this risk by converting a small percentage of their bitcoins into promising altcoins.   Especially altcoins where miners' power is more limited.

Satoshi's original idea was to design the protocol in such a way that the only way in which a miner can gain economically is to act in the interest of users. 
That is starting to break down because a single entity has gained half the minining power. To me the conclusion is simple: The protocol needs to be re-designed until it maximizes benefits for users again, not for miners only.   
My guess is that we can't get around introducing some form of PoS. There has been a lot of PoS research in altcoins and some of them look like they have better incentives and power distribution than bitcoin.
We should learn from them, because if bitcoin doesn't implement LN soon some other coin will.

A compromise with BU is not a compromise at all. It's a surrender to a hostile takeover of the entire 20bn bitcoin ecosystem by a handful of people who have proven that they don't have the best interest of bitcoin users at heart. 
Compromise already exists. Most big blockers (myself included) are happy to move forward with SegWit. What we need now is to excise those toxic 3 or 4 people from Bitcoin as cleanly as possible. We need to give the economic majority more power to achieve this. Bitcoin needs some form of Stakeholder voting mechanism to push through soft forks, and protect them against 50% attacks by hostile miners.

The PoW change doesn't need to be drastic. For example, hashing only every 12th block with a memory-hard PoW would limit double spending attacks by BU to 12 blocks or 2 hours. That would deter BU miners  from attacking and at the same time it would only reduce the revenue of "good" miners by 8%.

Low volatility is not as important for a safe haven asset as being decoupled from other assets, and being counter-cyclical. And bitcoin has proven to be both of those.

Accepting credit cards is costly for merchants.  These costs do get passed on to consumers but the consumers don't notice them because they are priced in.
Unfortunately merchants in America have a habit of passing on the costs to *all* consumers, even the ones who don't pay by credit card.
Effectively, the consumers who pay by cash or bitcoin are subsidizing the consumers who pay by credit card. That is not the fault of bitcoin, because it's 100% up to the merchants which payment system they subsidize or penalize.
Outside America the situation is different. In Germany, for instance, merchants hate using credit cards. You often have to pay a 2-3% "credit card fee" and many smaller merchants don't accept them at all.

There is no such thing as "legal" and "illegal" in a blockchain, there is only "true" or "false".
Judges can rule all they like, blockchains don't care, they only obey consensus.
But let's say the thief did go to court... I don't think that he would have much of a chance, because no promises were ever made that the Ethereum protocol is set in stone, neither implicitly nor explicitly.

When you install Bitcoin-Core, it pre-generates a pool of private keys. (100 by default).
Let's say you store some bitcoins in a wallet and put it in a safe. Then you make a copy of that wallet and load it into your laptop's bitcoin client. 
Every time you make a transaction, the change is sent to a new address (one of the addresses in that pool). Once the hot wallet runs out of addresses the client will generate new ones.
Let's say you made about 50 transactions, but then you lose the laptop. You can still recover your remaining bitcoins from the wallet in the safe. 
But let's say you made about 1000 transactions. Then your wallet in the safe will have become stale and you will lose some or all of your remaining bitcoins (the details will depend on how coin control was performed).
For bitcoin-core to be safe, you need to back up your hot wallet regularly. Cold storage wallets that you only retrieve once will never go stale of course.

Total volume is a pretty meaningless statistic though.

It is trivial to generate tons of "volume" out of thin air just by depositing a few hundred bitcoins and selling them to yourself 10 times a second.

As far as I know, Electrum uses deterministic wallets, so you don't need to update them. Any bitcoins sent to "change" addresses won't be lost as long as you don't lose your wallet seed. 
But yes, you have to be more careful with non-deterministic wallets such as Bitcoin-Core. 
Best practice is to make cold storage wallets single-use. Empty them completely and create a new cold storage wallet every time you withdraw bitcoins. Or simply make a large number of small wallets.
As for this "shit being too hard", yes, it's hard but it is getting easier every year.  And I would say it's already easier than securing physical cash or gold.  It's a good thing too, because as of 2017 bitcoin is not ready to absorb a large influx of new users.
It will still take a few years of hard work before bitcoin can scale to mass adoption levels.

1) As long as you only send coins to original addresses from the backed up wallet, incoming transactions are safe.  But if you send coins to an address that has recently been generated by a hot wallet, you might lose them if you lose that hot wallet.

I think that a good historic equivalent would be a piece of land in Manhattan around 1800. It experienced an astronomic price growth *without* a corresponding fall.

Bitcoin's long term price trend is not inexplicable. It's mostly determined by the growth in number of users. Graphs such as this one show a pretty good correlation with bitcoin price:
 
This growth rate is itself not arbitrary. It is tied to fundamental mechanisms, like the time it takes for developers to write and test code, the time it takes for users to familiarize themselves with the concept of the blockchain, the time it takes for the idea to gain traction in society, an so on. 
These mechanisms are orders of magnitude faster than the mechanisms which drove the growth of Manhattan land prices (migration, infrastructure construction, etc.), so it shouldn't be surprising that the price is also increasing at that kind of rate.
I agree that *short term* price fluctuations in bitcoin price are often inexplicable. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:05:11
I disagree. Bitcoin's sharp rise in price drove investment in infrastructure improvements (eg. clients, exchanges, hw wallets, businesses), which in turn made Bitcoin more useful, which in turn attracted even more speculators, and so on.
Bitcoin would never be where it is today without this virtuous cycle.  If people treated Bitcoin purely as a currency and it was still trading for $1 like back in 2011, then we would still have the shitty exchanges and theft-prone clients from 2011.

If you have lots of bitcoins, you should hide your encrypted private keys in many different geographic locations and cloud services. Then it's unlikely that the government will find all of them.

If you don't have a minimum of technical competence, or at least an interest in learning, then you have no business using bitcoin. Come back in 2020.
Bitcoin is not ready for the normalo user. Maybe it will be in a few years, but it isn't right now. Encouraging lots of normalos to join in at this stage makes bitcoin more fragile. The last thing we need is another mtgox.
It might be tempting to evangalize and push for premature mass adoption, because it certainly would push up the price in the short term.
But we should aim for slow, organic growth instead. Best way to grow is to move from the long end of the tail towards the middle, progressively embracing people with less and less expertise. Once we do reach the middle, my prediction is that most people will not directly interact with bitcoin, but with systems layered on top.

I get your point, but I think that fragility depends on the amount of fiat invested per user, not on the total amount. In general, investors buy and sell in response to their personal financial risk, which in turn depends on how much they have personally invested, not on how much the aggregate bitcoin economy has invested.
The number of users has been growing exponentially in line with the price, so that's why I don't think bitcoin is more fragile than during previous bubbles. It would be nice to see some data on how average holdings per user have changed.

That's because you and your bank are not equal counterparties.
If your bank defaults, the government will cover your losses 100% (up to 100,000 EUR), with minimum hassle.
If you default, the government will NOT cover the bank's losses. And the bank has to chase after you at great expense (lawyers, bailiffs, etc)
Keeping money in a bank is basically risk-free (barring a black swan event such as a currency crisis).

True, under my scheme the wealthy don't pay tax on hoarded money. But as long as they are hoarding it they are not consuming so they are effectively poor. As soon as the wealthy *spend* their money they pay tax in proportion to the natural resources that they consume. 
Seems perfectly fair to me. 
As for poor people, there are other ways of helping them than tax breaks.  If a poor person asks for help from the government, then (and *only* then) it is reasonable for government to ask them to report their wealth.

Taxes on land and natural resources are a lot more "fair" than taxes on financial transactions. 
Why? because different people have different abilities to hide their financial transactions from government. Unless it's a North Korea style total surveillance society, government will only be taxing a fraction of the financial transactions that happen in the economy. "Honest" people end up paying more tax than people who are able to operate in the dark economy. Government is constantly playing a game of surveillance whack-a-mole, at a huge cost, to extract ever diminishing returns from the dark economy. 
On the other hand, taxing land and natural resources only requires minimal surveillance. Land owners and miners of natural resources will pass the tax up the supply chain and the market will distribute the tax to all consumers, even the ones in the dark economy.

Economics is as much a religion as it is a science.  Many "established economic principles" have been discredited throughout history as the world economy went through paradigm shifts.

Switzerland experienced deflation recently and it's doing better than any of the neighboring countries, all of which experienced inflation.
In my personal, anecdotal experience, I haven't seen a lot of hoarding in Switzerland. On the contrary. People are going "wow, my CHF savings are worth more now, so I can finally afford to buy this nice luxury I've always wanted!".
It's worth noting that the cause of deflation in Switzerland is very different from Japan. In Switzerland it's caused by a shrinking money supply as foreigners are panic buying CHF. In Japan it's caused by shrinking demand due to a stagnating economy. Deflation in Japan is just the *symptom* of their problems, not the *cause*.

Speculation is essential for Bitcoin.  
Bootstrapping Bitcoin is a virtuous cycle that works something like this:
Satoshi releases client -&gt; this attracts a few speculators -&gt; price rises -&gt; this attracts more developers -&gt; client improves -&gt; this attracts more speculators -&gt; price rises -&gt; this attracts even more developers and BTC businesses -&gt; bitcoin becomes easier to use -&gt; this attracts more speculators -&gt; .....
Without speculation, Bitcoin would never have gotten off the ground.

I don't understand your concern.
As you say, spending large amounts of BTC on mansions and sports cars is likely to be noticed.  Ideology aside, a bitcoin user would be stupid not to pay taxes on those things.  Just because someone doesn't agree with paying taxes in principle doesn't mean they are an idiot.
On the other hand:
People who only cash out small amounts for daily expenses will stay under the radar.
People who hold bitcoins until their retirement, and decide to worry about tax issues later, will also stay under the radar.
People who don't own more than approx. 10,000 USD worth of BTC will also stay under the radar.
So apart from a handful of idiots with more money than sense, I don't see how most bitcoin users, not even the libertarian camp, are going to "ruin it".

First of all, Brazil is kind of a low tech country compared to US/Asia/Europe. For instance, mobile internet is still inaccessible to most people. The general population's interest in tech stuff is low to non-existent.  So there is probably very little demand for Bitcoin to begin with.
Second, it's really really hard to open a business in Brazil. To get an idea, the country ranks 130 out of 185 countries on the Ease of Doing Business Index. 
That's probably why there aren't a lot of services involved in selling bitcoins so far.

Wikipedia doesn't care about objectivity. All they care about is a vague notion of "neutrality", where neutrality usually means balancing what they deem as "reliable sources".  Whether the sources themselves are objective is not even debated because that would be considered "original research".
I once came across a dubious statement in a Wikipedia article which was not backed by any proof, empirical or otherwise.  So I deleted it. But some self appointed expert kept reverting my deletion. Show me the proof, I said.  So they threw about a dozen sources at me, some of which were even scientific journals.  But when reading carefully through the sources, it turned out that all of them were referencing a single root source, which was itself just an opinion piece based on pure conjecture and not containing a shred of hard evidence.  But the sheer number and weight of sources was enough to convince the admins. So I gave up.
Wikipedia has some excellent sections, but articles on contentious topics such as Bitcoin are usually rubbish.  They have become a playground for people to push their agenda.

Ok, I'll give you a less "hypothetical" example:
You are traveling in a foreign country and you oversleep your alarm clock.  You only have 30 minutes to get to the airport or you will miss your flight home, and your sister's wedding, which is a few hours after your scheduled arrival.  You have no cash on you, only 0.9 Bitcoins on your smartphone. 
There is a shortage of taxis because of a major sporting event.  For the same reason, all the ATMs are empty.  Still, you are lucky enough to find one of the few taxis still vacant.  However, the driver doesn't accept credit cards, only cash or bitcoin. He charges 1 BTC for the trip. He is in a grumpy, take-it-or-leave it kind of mood so bargaining won't work. 
(1) You can either give up on the taxi, but then your chance of catching the flight is practically 0%.
(2) Or you can bet the 0.9 BTC on a quick round of Satoshidice, and that will give you a 90% chance of catching the flight, and not missing your sister's wedding.
Which option would you choose? 1 or 2?
The worst that can happen is that you lose 0.9 BTC and miss the flight.  But isn't it worth taking a chance? It's your sister's wedding after all.

I think he does understand statistics. Here is some statistics for you:
In the above example, the expectation values of your change in wealth are (approximately) as follows:
Don’t play Satoshidice:  -10,000 * 1 =   **-10,000**  BTC
Play Satoshidice: (-10,000-0.9) * 0.1  +  0.1 * 0.9 =  **-1,000** BTC
While it is true that the expectation value when playing Satoshidice is *always* negative, there are rare situations in which the expectation value of not playing is *even more negative*, hence playing is the rational choice.

I am not against taxes in principle, but I disagree with the manner in which most governments collect taxes at the moment. 
Privacy is a human right, and that includes financial privacy.  The need for taxation does not justify surveillance and intrusion into peoples' private lives.  Not only is it not the state's business what people own, or who they associate with, this information is also unnecessary in order to collect a fair "contribution to the state". 
I am a citizen and benefit from public goods, such as military and roads? Fine, then tax me for the right to be a citizen. Don't tax me for my *behavior*. Don't tax me for buying and selling *private goods*.
