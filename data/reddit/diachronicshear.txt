Lawl wow. Well, there's Bitcoin Cash now if you actually want to move money without huge fees so...maybe? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

No. Every other crypto has a smaller transaction fee and faster confirmation times. Most have plans in place to mitigate or avoid the problems bitcoin ran in to. It also helps that other cryptos have leadership teams that can make decisions relatively quickly.

That's the hope, but it's not happening as fast as everyone hoped. I personally think it'll be about 3-6 months before things are ironed out.

Lightning has been "around the corner" for years. No one should ever count on it happening. Waiting for lightning network is a fool's errand.

Yes, Bitcoin implemented SegWit, which is supposed to do this, and also there was a recent breakaway that formed Bitcoin Cash, which just increased the maximum block size, which is also intended to alleviate the problem.

both subs are still just a pissing contest. No different than 2 years ago when I peaced out.

just some advice from someone who's been around a bunch, don't ever expect any lightning network to get activated. LN has been "around the corner" for the last 3 years. Same on other platforms.

Are you new to bitcoin? This has been an ongoing problem for years. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:55:02
Yes the community. I got into Ethereum at the same time and was putting small amounts into both for about 6 more months until I went all in Ethereum around a year ago. 
I never hated Bitcoin, just the toxicity of the Reddit communities.

I got into Ethereum at the same time. Did much better for myself financially and it was nice seeing posts about tech development and new projects, not just constant shitting on the people that didn't believe what you did.
