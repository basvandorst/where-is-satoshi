If you are going to use coinbase, I suggest buying ETH and then transferring that to an exchange and switching cryptos there.

I have to admit, this video concerns me.

Since we're on the subject, a more detailed debt clock: 
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:37:41
It is an estimate for the accumulation rate of the U.S. Public Debt based in the official reports of same from the U.S. Treasury.    
If you hover over the numbers the source is displayed at the top, including whether or not it is real time.  I'm into cool visualizations and I like this one, lots of information.

Great post.  I didn't buy early, but I've got into my BTC stake.  Since I did that I've been playing with Crypto trading.  If you want to HODL and ignore the price dips and rises, put the BTC into a cold storage and start trading cryptos!  Fun, keeps you up to date, and you don't sweat the price of BTC, because it's just the backbone security that allows you to play the market.

Can we stop calling them newbies (noobies) or treating them like they are less than the HODL crowd.  The network is what gives BTC value.  Encourage them to be part of the network and respect each other; we create change together.

You are just a troll with insults instead of insights.

I'm not concerned about your beliefs.  Do the calculations yourself (I was born in 1975): 
I name you an agent attempting to sow FUD in cryptos.  Your attempt to discredit me instead of offering actual facts/data suggests an ulterior motive.

I've been waiting over two weeks for them to confirm my account and allow me to buy BTC.  Still waiting.

Where did I state my position on inflation?  I've not misrepresented anything.  I simply stated that the dollar has lost 78% of its value since 1975. I assume you don't refute that now?   You can say this is not the entire economic picture, but I'm not going to Bob Ross that in a reddit post.   I assume the other information I stated is also not in question?  So what point do you make other than trying to discredit my very real points to a question you posed?  I'm still waiting for some data that supports your point and refutes mine.  Those are just some of the reasons I feel centralized banking has not served the interests of the working american.  Attempting to dismiss my points by representing my them as uninformed/uncertain/uneducated instead of showing data that refutes it is a classic mechanism to spread FUD.  Let the data speak instead of your "opinion."  You have no idea what I understand or do not, I can just as easily say you have no idea what you are talking about.  But my points are backed by facts.

Please re-read the thread.  I didn't state anything other than the dollar has lost 78% of its value.  That is not a statement on whether or not any inflation is good or bad.  You can't even put together a cogent argument, just personal attacks on my understanding, and ridicule.  It's clear you think you are some sort of genius that doesn't require data to come to conclusions.  Perhaps you have a future in politics with your textbook FUD.  Thanks for the well wishes, I'm doing quite well.

Since I've been alive the dollar has lost 78% of its value.  I recall a savings and loans bailout, and the subprime bailout.  Institutionalization of my credit history, and switching of agreements on what interest I owe on loans.

Ok, I also dislike Coinbase, but I like to put about small amount in dollars each week into the marketplace.  So I set up weekly transfers from my bank account through Coinbase, transfer to GDAX then send to another exchange (Binance, Kucoin, ED,) and buy my crypto.  Then every three months or so I move all the ERC20 coins to my Trezor.  Gemini didn't allow me to set up an account so how else am I supposed to get my $$ into crypto if I don't use Coinbase?

Sorry about that typo, I'll make sure to use it correctly in the future.

I've banked with both big banks and credit unions for years.  I very much prefer credit unions, good personal service and they don't fund war contracts.  The wait time has occasionally been an issue for both types of banks, which is also why I like BTC.

I thought it was implicit that this could only happen if the Republicans killed net neutrality.  I agree with your second statement, I'm just throwing ideas out to start conversation.  Right now we are still dealing with fiat vs blockchain, so we'll need to address this using both systems to deal with the current attack on free flow of information.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:01:04
too volatile.  I'd rather keep the BTC.

Very nice representation.
