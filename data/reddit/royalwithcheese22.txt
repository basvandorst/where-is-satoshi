I would like to know if there is anything specific to consider before I update my bicoin client from Bitcoin Core 0.9.2.1 to 0.14.0. Have there been any forks or compatibility issues or is updating to 0.14.0 save? Does the new version still work with my old wallet? Etc...
@_date: 2017-04-12 20:30:38
Thank you. That's exactly the kind of info I was looking for. :)

Enough people care about diablo. Think of the promotional value it would have for bitcoin if Blizzard starts accepting them.

Just an Idea: Try to establish a local economy based on bitcoin. BUT don't simply try to convert prices from € to Bitcoin. 
Price the goods much, much cheaper in bitcoins. Let's say for example 1 loaf of bread would still cost 1-2€ but only 0.0001 bitcoin. 
These really cheap prices are meant for local use only. If you export stuff from Cyprus you simply convert the price of the product and charge the same amount you would have gotten in € instead in bitcoin. 
This is really important. Make it clear to your people. Don't sell off huge amounts of local goods at these cheap prices to international businesses or to people that would only resell them with huge profits.
This would have multiple effects.
* People in Cyprus wouldn't need to buy/convert big amounts of € to bitcoin for their economy to work. If prices are low enough some of the initial bitcoin supply could come from the many free bitcoin sites (like bitvisitor etc.).
* Cyprus would become ultra cheap for tourists using bitcoin. I think you would attract lots of people bringing bitcoins in. 
* Goods and work would be affordable to local businesses and the economy could grow again.
* Prices (in bitcoin) would slowly rise to their Euro-equivalent due to the tourists bringing in more and more bitcoin.
* Eventually Cyprus would end up with a working, bitcoin-based economy fit for international trade.
What do you think?

the acceptance of the public. I already stated the reasons you won't achieve that as long as you keep up the esoteric anti-authoritative babbling.
Acceptance of the public isn't the same as approval by politicians. Look at piracy.

This isn't about smarts. It's about ethics. I wouldn't screw other people in a million years.

Isn't this a perfect opportunity to take the next step and think about accepting bitcoin without converting them to USD at all.
Start accepting bitcoin alongside USD. When customers pay dollars, fine, do business as usual. BUT offer a discount for customers paying in bitcoin. Since bitcoin isn't (officially) currency you can probably avoid taxes completely. Keep the coins. Can you imagine what people will do to get their drugs cheaper? You will be swimming in bitcoins soon. The bitcoin value will rise, more businesses will start accepting them. Everybody wins...

Would you care to elaborate what's wrong with my post. Apart from you obviously disagreeing on the 400$ part?

Tried in Firefox, Firefox with Ghostery and Adblock disabled, Firefox private browsing mode, Chrome, Chrome with Adblock and DoNotTrackMe disabled, Chrome in incognito mode and Internet Explorer without any addons. NONE OF IT WORKED. Now I'm slightly pissed.
EDIT: Tried Opera. Didn't work.

Thanks to Max this post should be marked NFSW !!! On RT he is tame compared to this. Had a good laugh.

That was very useful info. Thanx very much.

I think it's Government and Central Bankers behind the DDOS to destroy confidence in Bitcoin and get rid of their worst enemy.

Insulting people seems to be the only thing you can. And by the way your'e not very good at it. I'm not into bitcoin for profit at all. I want it to succeed as a currency. And yes I believe a transition without losers is theoretically possible. I will never 'cash out' but rather buy things. The possibility of making a profit is a mere bonus to the true benefit bitcoin will have as a currency. But this probably never occurred to you. Judging by your responses so far and your constant rain of insults you are a dim wit. So Fuck off...

I had the same problem. ~0.005 BTC still in my DeepBit account. So I set the automatic payment limit to 0.1 and mined to just above 0.01. Then I requested payment. Now the account is at 0.
Hope that helps.

Actually the mainstream media starting to slander bitcoin strengthens my confidence in bitcoin. I've been waiting for it and if mainstream news were only hyping bitcoin and reporting in a favorable way, I would strongly consider the possibility that bitcoin is just another bankster/government/CIA plot to rip people off. So I'm quiet thankful to the media for confirming that TPTB are not in favor of bitcoin.

In the spirit of OP's post i want to share an idea.
I had a vision of applications having their own individual bitcoin adresses. The browser has one, the media player has one, the bittorrent client has one, etc.
One can send some bitcoins from your main wallet to let's say your your media player. And so your media player becomes ready for Pay Per View instantly. Your browser can tip or pay any webside or bitcoin adress it comes upon with one single click and without you having to use your main wallet or starting your bitcoin client. Your torrent client can pay for copyrighted trorrents or simply tip the artist on the fly.
And...obviously all your apps can receive bitcoins as well. 
What do you think?

Thank you. Don't know if you recall... You were the only one that answered my question yesterday about the unconfirmed transactions.
Nice to have people like you around.
 
Btw...still waiting for those confirmations.
See ya next time. :)

Good Idea. The more websites accept Bitcoin the better. Let's start sending emails to as many sites as possible and ask them to accept bitcoin.
P.S.: I'm going to ask my local pizza delivery service to accept Bitcoin.

Protip is the right description. Cause actually most of the tips given in your linked article are close to useless to a semi-noob like me.
1st Tip: Use 2 Wallets. Question: How? I run BitcoinQT 7.2 and it and apparently it doesn't support multiple wallets.
2nd Tip: Rename your wallet. Question: If I rename my wallet wouldn't my bitcoinclient fail to find it and thus stop operating. I have the portable BitcoinQT that comes in a ZIP file instead of an installer and I would love to run it from an USB-stick. Yet although the program itself is portable I have no idea how to tell it not to use the default location and name to store the wallet etc. So how would I do that?
OK tips 3-5 I haven't even contemplated yet since I allready fail at 1 &amp; 2.
Help would be appreciated.
P.S.: I don't dare to simply experiment since I have some money in my wallet already.

Well, 8 hours wouldn't have made me nervous. But the the first transaction I posted is over 1 day old. Also it says 0.0005 BTC in fees have been paid at the bottom of the page.
