Just going off publicly defined terms. A hot wallet is an internet based wallet. A warm wallet is a wallet on an internet connected device. A cold wallet is a wallet that's not connected to the internet. There's Nothing more secure about a paper wallet than a Nano S.

Because there was a massive influx of new users taking the path of least resistance with coinbase wallets that haven't implemented segwit. In that context a few bad actors can have significant influence on charts based on transaction percentage, but every week we see new wallets adding segwit support and there's been a massive call by the community to vote with our wallets. 
Coinbase is literally subsidizing on-chain transactions with coinbase funds, multiplying the issue. Change is coming.

Bitcoin itself cannot be hacked. Individuals and organizations holding bitcoin can be. Your bitcoin wallet is only as secure as the device holding it. That's why 95% of my btc is in cold storage (specifically a ledger Nano S).

Bitcoin is the OG project with the OG vision, the longest chain, proven immutability, and decentralized. I wish the alts the best of luck (I've got money in many of them), but they're largely riding bitcoin coattails. If  I was a betting man I'd say bitcoin makes 99.9% of them superfluous in the next 18 months.

Me? Keep some in BTC. Move some to ETH and XMR. Maybe keep some BTC on Binance to trade shitcoins with. 
My point being *where they will most likely sell* is the only step that could be construed as negative for Bitcoin, I don't think we can assume it's the most likely POA, and even if it was it would imply a zero-sum game for BTC in relation to USDT.

Just odd that you didn't share this info in December. Awfully convenient to come in a month after the correction, well into the bear market and go around telling people you predicted this. Interesting correlation though. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:28:29


Yep. This is true. Though any amount of time can pass between opening and closing the channel and you can bet your ass custodial services will come in and make a LN connected wallet the default. 


Yeah... if needed, but inherently rare. The difference in the fee change presegwit -&gt; segwit VS segwit -&gt; LN will be orders of magnitude and only one will be useful for POS. Stands to reason there would be mass migration to LN wallets, flooring on-chain transactions. 


oh no, you heard it here first folks, LN is dead!

I feel like this is the definition of circular logic. Your explanation for how Tether failure will hurt BTC is that investors think that Tether failure will hurt BTC? I mean maybe.

It's structured around my expectations with a touch of risk mitigation. 
I don't see monero going anywhere as of now. Conceivably Bitcoin could accomplish the same goal, but as of now Monero is the OG privacy coin and they have a great team. 
Ethereum, I admittedly don't fully understand. But I see it as the OG smart contract coin. Again Bitcoin could bring this functionality under it's wing (and I know at least one project already is), but right now it's unique in that respect. 
The alt coins are more or less just fun to play with. Some of them are interesting projects. I personally think bitcoin can do most everything they set out to do with updates/sidechains, but in the short to medium term they'll rise with the crypto market cap. And I've got very mild FOMO should one of them moon big, I like to have a lil of each.
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:05:47
So you think bitcoin's value should be about equal to it's value before segwit, before bitcoin futures, before major bitcoin trading desks, before lightning network on testnet, before lightning network on main net?
I mean, shit! Sure as hell must have been overvalued last year! What's your ATH valuation after LN? 3500?
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:41:08
that seems like incentive to root for bitcoin...? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:12:06
No, you're very plainly wrong. A huge number of bitcoin hodler's, including myself, don't intend to shed their bitcoin until it's reached wide adoption at which time they'll exchange it for goods and services or invest elsewhere. 
Yes, many whales are in for a quick buck and can exert enormous control in a low liquidity market like this. But some of us are looking past the month of January and struggle to see a future where crypto isn't widely adopted.

recognizes segwit generally increases blocksize and future blocksize increases will be necessary. segwit is a prereq for lightning that is the main priority for scaling. we're doing our best to prep for lightning while maintaining decentralization.   
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:58:20
Which won't be the case once we've achieved sufficient liquidity. These aren't new problems everybody.
In the short and medium term an inflation rate for btc still wouldn't matter as it's inevitably going to increase in value. We're hodling until the day comes that the market levels out. In the mean time I'll still gladly make purchases with bitcoin and then rebuy the equivalent amount of bitcoin.
If, in the long term, we realize inflation is in fact necessary (up for debate if I'm not mistaken), a change can be made to supply when consensus is achieved. Otherwise it will continue to mimic the gold market which seems to be doing just fine.

that's exactly what liquidity does... to any market... the more money in bitcoin, the less influence individuals can have on it's price.  When you can have larger trade volume without significantly moving the price, you have stability.

If lightning network had equal adoption by projects as segwit has now, transactions on the blockchain wouldn't particularly matter. We'd have achieved a decentralized, highly secure network with  fast and cheap transactions. We'd be POS ready while staying trustless. Which is the end-game. If people want to pay out their ass to transact on-chain they're free to.

- do you believe this technology has a future? 
- do you believe bitcoin will increase from it's current value over time? 
and make your decision accordingly. everyone here either: 
a) owns bitcoin because they believe it will increase in value
b) doesn't own bitcoin because they believe it will dip lower and then increase in value later on, so they're waiting to buy
c) doesn't own bitcoin because they don't believe in the project, so are trying to spread FUD
I personally fall in category A, because unlike the B's, I don't think I'm smart enough to time this market. So I bought in and plan to sit on my investment for the long haul.

It captured the vast majority of new users in the West the last 3 months... Kindof fucking ridiculous to chalk that up as insignificant.
Stay on topic, this has nothing to do with segwit's affect on fees. We're talking about adoption. Which is happening significantly with other providers, in a way that a % transaction chart doesn't portray. [Segwit has been adopted by many, many projects.]( 
If the same providers adopted LN, once ready, we would have a fully functional LN on mainnet. 
So to bring it back to your first point - yes, LN will be adopted just as Segwit is being.

It increased user protections from data protection by their ISP, that's an objective fact.
I said it fostered competition of internet based companies not internet service providers. I don't see how it would have any affect at all on ISP competition - care to share your reasoning?
You've literally done nothing. At all. Whatsoever. To make the case that net neutrality decreased competition.
Net Neutrality being a regulation, while other regulations decreased competition, doesn't make net neutrality anti- competitive. If that's actually your argument, please just come out and say it so I can move on with my life.
Edit: you also dodged my question

Oh now we're saying Net Neutrality is the reason we have few broadband choices?
Could someone explain to me why Comcast, Verizon, TW, and AT&amp;T's extremely competent lobbyists would pay millions of dollars to increase the competition they currently (don't) face?
Hint: they don't and you guys are either stupid or masochists or both
No ISP start up has ever hoped to break into the market only to be thwarted by an obligation to not throttle sites and violate user privacy. It's shitty contracts with local municipalities that have absolutely fuck all to do with Net Neutrality.

I don't trust implicitly in government. I look at each proposed regulation for what it is and judge it on it's substance. 
Trusting wholly in blind deregulation and treating every piece of legislation like it's an assault on our economy is based on unfounded dogma.

What about him...? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:25:57
What specific problem/hurdle did net neutrality cause competitors trying to enter the market?
I can tell you the positives of Net Neutrality - greater consumer privacy and grounds to sue ISP's for throttling services. It lowers financial barriers for internet based companies to come to market and thus increases competition. 
Now your turn. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:23:39

He's asking you because it's your choice. You can still transact directly on the blockchain if you'd like. But for small transactions, we as a community have decided that making them affordable on-chain is not the priority.
