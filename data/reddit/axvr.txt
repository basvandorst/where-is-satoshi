CW should just be ignored. He is a fraud who wants to make money off of what he claims to have created (but didn't).
What CW was advocating for was Bitcoin Unlimited (BTU). BTU had a few advantages which were only really positives for miners. Bitcoin Unlimited would have mostly kept the Bitcoin protocol the same, except changing the maximum transaction block size (to 8MB I think). The increase in block size would solve the major problem of the speed of the network, and the ever increasing size of the mempool.
For those who supported BTU the biggest problem that they had was with the alternative (SegWit), which would remove a lot of the power from the miners. Another advantage of BTU for miners was that Bitcoin would remain mostly the same, so they knew what the future of Bitcoin was going to be, and would not be heading towards an unknown (not unknown anymore, tested in Litecoin).
The potential problem of a hard fork like BTU, is that the price would drastically collapse, and they would have to fight to become the dominant coin. Both sides had a "Nuclear" option, which would allow them to win over the other coin. For BTU, because they had the most support from the miners, they would have more miners than BTC so could "attack" the other network rendering it useless. This is what Craig Wright wanted to do, it is about money and power.
Bitcoin Unlimited is now dead because of the agreement on SegWit2X. Craig has lost, this is why he was mad.

That depends, if you want to as soon as possible, do it before July 20th and move them into cold storage. Otherwise I would reccommend waiting till 2018.
