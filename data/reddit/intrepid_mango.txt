How do I do this? On coinbase or binance. I'm really anxious and frustrated. I would advise my friends from now on to be cautious with binance and to send a few coins to test it.

\[Update\] 
I just copied my binance deposit address once again and pasted it on google to test for malware and it seemed to confirm most of my suspicions and others on here. It seems o be a malware issue from what i can tell. It changed the address when i pasted it from my original binance one to (12HaVrpXkLr2UnkMf6X9bY11cuNrZUdUnV) the mysterious address substituted by the malware.
I thought my laptop was secure but it looks like i will have to be careful transferring funds from now on. 
Anyway thanks for the help lads! i guess i was not prepared since i hadn't come across such a malware before and now i will be extra cautious from now on. Shame i had to learn the hard way.

Well that was the address binance provided me and I pasted it to coinbase pro and withdrew my BTC coins. The thing is binance are altogether ignoring me even though I took screenshots of the transaction as I always like to keep proof. �� This is really the worst first experience with binance. The same thing did not occur with coinbase and coinbase pro leading me to conclude that binance were responsible and not just some random malware.

I would have concluded the same thing but I made sure to click the copy address icon so it was automatically and not human error on my side. Which is why I was so surprised that the amount was not sent to my address. My binance address has also changed adding to my suspicion.

Yeah right that's like asking bitconnect to kindly return the money of the naive multitude.

Now you understand how i feel. This did not happen to my brother but when i took his advice to invest in crypto with my luck this bizarre incident occured to me.
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:04:00
Yeah that was just my typing mistake.

Binance said they never received the funds so it has to be coinbase where things went wrong.

Sorry i typo'd the address. I must be driving you nuts! it's this 
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:31:10


Aha! i see i will try to edit it. Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:23:52
Yep I can use some other device that not mine. It's really strange b cause coinbase replied with this message. I don't know how to post a screenshot of the email but this is what it contained.

Would they ask me to put more money in or just charge me higher fee?
