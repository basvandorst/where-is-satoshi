Hey, cheese wizard here, thought I'd expand and clarify. We are still in the 'this is fun' stage of taking bitcoin, so I was probably chattering a little more than was necessary during the transaction (thanks for coming to the truck, by the way!). I made it sound more complex than it really is. It isn't Paypal we are using, but Bitpay and Square Register. The only reason I am using Square alongside the Bitpay system is to keep a single database with the total days take (for accounting/tax purposes) and a list of all the sandwiches that were sold (for restocking and sales trend tracking purposes). If we wanted to, we could just as easily copy the data from Bitpay at the end of the month, but I like to have a daily spreadsheet of whats coming in and going out, which Square provides nicely.
As to the potential for fraud, yeah, it's there. I think a lot of the other posters are right though and it will be rare. In a year of selling yummy sandwiches I have had one individual use a stolen credit card that resulted in a charge back. Believe me, if I ever see him again, he will be recognized and repeatedly dipped in molten cheese. There is the potential for a fake bill too. Our philosophy is to keep the service fast and trust our customers. Only if there is a widespread hack will we consider changing this policy, but I think the community of bitcoin users are generally pretty upstanding and cool. And why waste the effort for a grilled cheese sandwich that will only taste like treachery and ashes in your mouth?
Thanks one more time for the recomendation, come back any time!
