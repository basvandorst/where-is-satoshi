I figured the FBI wouldn't give a crap about this small time scam. I still think they wont. I wish I was some important person, like the governor's daughter... or Bono,.

Thanks I'll try

Thanks for your help

about how long is a "while" few days?
also my wallet... that would be the Mycelium wallet? The one just on my phone? I just installed it, didn't have to make up a username or password or anything...

Unfortunately no there aren't any near us... so this site might be sketchy? I.e eat our money and were still screwed?
I wish I knew more about this whole process so I could explain myself better.

Thanks for this offer, I will try to PM you... sorry it might take a little bit of time, I'm running around like a crazy person trying to put out fires.

how does one "sell" me bitcoin in person? I thank everyone for bearing with me as I have no experience with any of this. Edit: I also just installed Mycelium

Could anyone invite me to trucoin? My IT guy just said I need an invite. Sorry if I'm saying anything that doesn't make sense, trying to be the go-between for 5 different people.

I have no idea what this means, my bad. I thought the unlock sites provided an unlock code.  You can just try out files? I'll have to take a look!
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:51:34
I heard that (forgive me again, I'm no computer genius, just about normal) that if this key doesn't work, we're screwed... and that it doesn't work for all victims. My IT guy said the risk was that if the key generated didn't unlock them, even if we pay, we'll never be able to unlock the files. Confirm/deny

Ok, so once I "buy" the bitcoins.. how do I "get" them. This sounds dumb, but I have no experience with this. Is there a bitcoin bank? Are they confined to one electronic device? Thanks everyone for your help... seriously

Yes, and we were stupid... we didn't have a back up version of our server. Live and learn. One uninformed employee can do this, that's the scary part. The people who pull this shit deserve to be eaten alive by ants. The angry kind of ants. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:46:05
so I would go there and beg for mercy?
@_date: 2014-08-28 16:01:36
Yes, new warning antivirus, informing the staff, backing up the server... fun, fun stuff. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:47:33
Can someone please invite me to trucoin? My IT guy said I need an invite?
@_date: 2014-08-28 19:31:26
There are no guarantees. I have in my head that it might not work. We have removed all malwear, so the computers are secured. Basically I believe what is supposed to happen is they provide a patch or something to fix it after the fact. The IT guy knows more about this. I do know there is a strong possibility we are boned, but at least not ALL of the server was affected. I don't think we were "targeted" specifically, just kind of on the list of people to fish. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:22:37
Yes I think they're the ones that have to invite me.. I think i'm on some kind of waiting list.

The only thing I can think of, is that if they DO unblock the files after you pay, that it gives credibility to their whole scheme. If word gets out that they still tell you to go fuck yourself after you pay them, then nobody would pay eventually. I am probably giving them too much credit, but that's the only reason I can think of for them keeping their "word" (the word of a piece of human garbage).

We tried it. Didn't work. We were dumb for not having a backup.
