from what i seen on other mycelium posts on redit thats how the other ppls dealth with this i just am not expirenced enough to know how to realy do that im asking how to do that i dont want to courupt it or watever from what i understand i can take the seed and somehow use the key(wich for watever reason i have 4 of i did 3 transactions) i dont know how to get to the key like i can get on mycelium n see my adress but i never really messed with this enough to know what the key is im assuming its not my address ther is keys and a bunch of letters n numbers but i think its the same as the address that pops up wen i click recive

i think it is an emergency honestly from what i understand if you have the brand new updated mycelium you have to import it to somthing else
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:36:39
how do i find the private key i can get back to my paxful account easy
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:34:42
