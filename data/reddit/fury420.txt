Not quite, if anything my assumption is more that the Core Devs working there haven't changed their vision based on pressure by Blockstream (there's an edit to my top-level post that elaborates a bit)
Frankly... I'm okay if there's some disconnect between what the users want, and what the developers think is realistic. 


Yes, there were some big names in tech VC.
But... you complained specifically about AXA and PwC, neither of which were involved until a year and a half later.

It seems unlikely an additional public funding round would/could alter preexisting employment contracts from years prior.
And several of the mentions I speak of are recent, well after the most recent round of investments. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 16:46:35


Perhaps they are, I just feel people greatly over-exaggerate their potential influence, particularly since they're among the newest and we've seen no real change in Core's direction since their involvement. 


I just see this as a situation where VC funding does not buy nearly as much control/influence as it would in other companies. 
Blockstream's only real value is in the team, the developers that founded it, the handful of other Core Devs that now work there, etc... 
There are no real physical assets to speak of, all the work on Bitcoin itself is open-source, and various Blockstream employed Core devs have mentioned employment agreements crafted so as to resist corporate pressure, that allow them to leave with severance if they feel uncomfortable, etc...

Problem is..... Bitfinex had a proper hot wallet/cold storage style setup back when many of us initially checked out their security. 
I haven't really used the exchange at all recently, so I didn't really look too deeply into their Bitgo partnership from last year. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 16:03:16


I think it's particularly important when you remember that the Core Devs are the talent, without them Blockstream is meaningless. If the non-Devs try to push an agenda there's nothing to stop the devs from walking, leaving the company largely defunct. 


The investment by a small data/fintech focused VC fund run by AXA took place in the most recent Feb 2016 funding round. Likewise with the PwC connection early this year, neither were around for the formation of the company. 
Hell, even Bitcoin Core's public development roadmap predates their involvement with Blockstream. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:16:52
I appreciate the clarification, thanks. 
More detail on the involvement of those entities some view as the "shadowy financial elite" might go along way. My hunch has been that the AXA VC fund doesn't own a particularly significant stake, but I've not really ran across any public info I can use to support that claim. 
I understand that such details are private business matters, it just might be worthwhile discussing internally at Blockstream (and among investors) as it might help the company assuage people's fears.

A few years back a group of Bitcoin's developers (including like 5 Core devs) got together with some tech, business and VC people and founded a company, then solicited outside investment and received 21M in a public funding round, and then another 55M in a second public funding round in Feb 2016.


Is that company being allowed to influence Bitcoin protocol development in any way, shape or form as part of having hired core developers?
The issue with answering this is that the most influential Core devs at the company are also the company's Founders, it's not like this is some outside entity just hiring up all the developers for their own nefarious purposes. 
Nobody's yet to provide any actual evidence that Blockstream *as an entity* is influencing Bitcoin protocol development, as the Core Devs that work for Blockstream all already had influence before. 
AFAIK none of the new, non-Core employees are directly working on Core, and Bitcoin Core's head maintainer (Wladimir) does not work for Blockstream at all. 
Edit: 
How does one separate &amp; differentiate between the influence individual Core Devs already had pre-Blockstream, and the influence they continue to have now?
If anything, the "failure" of the HK agreement goes to show the lack of centralized control at Blockstream. 
Somehow even the President has little influence, and the Core devs that work at Blockstream are free to hold other opinions and advocate them as part of the decentralized Core. 
Shit... Greg literally called them "well meaning dipshits" over it, and maaku7 spoke out immediately against the agreement. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 15:36:44
It's also worthwhile to note that five of the Core Devs are among the company's Founders, it's not like this is some pre-existing outside entity hiring up all the devs.

It's mentioned in the full text of the roadmap that FAQ links to:

block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). 


understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.

I have not, I don't believe they've been made public and I'm just some random user. 
I've just seen mention of various aspects from maaku7 and nullc on a few occasions. IIRC there was a third who mentioned, but I'm not recalling who.


The delay of segwit's release really makes a 1 year perspective look poor, I agree. But... there is a fair bit of other worthwhile development that has occurred as well, it's just unfortunate that it's overshadowed by their difficulty in sticking to timeline.

There is actually a hardfork to raise the block size discussed on Core's Official Roadmap, it explicitly mentions 2/4/8MB
Of course, it says this is a possibility after various other features like Segwit, improved block propagation, fraud proofs, etc... reduce the perceived risk in doing so, and that's not soon enough for the "hard fork NOW" crowd. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:39:33

You are correct, the initial SegWit required a hardfork, and received little attention, relegated to the "things we'd like to hardfork someday" pile.
However, the possibility of a softforked implementation for SegWit was introduced at the "Scaling Bitcoin" conferences last fall, and was a huge hit. 
The subsequent Core Roadmap ([original text here]( is also talking about the new soft-fork SegWit.

Whoa slow down here, I've never seen anyone but you claim they have earned a billion in profits, that would be utterly absurd. 
The business model is that the several Billion are customer deposits, held to back the USDT issued to customers and redeemable by those customers. Tether's earnings / profits are the 0.2% of fiat deposit &amp; withdrawals (which would work out to millions in profits just from deposits during this bullrun) and then whatever interest (if any) they're receiving on the fiat held in Banks. 
And honestly, given the vast holdings of the affiliated crypto exchanges it's not unbelievable that Tether is holding several Billion worth of fiat.
Did you know that Bitfinex alone has ~700m in USD/USDT out on margin loans right now?

There was a near complete hashrate consensus prior to and at the time of the fork, and none of the exchanges were opposed to the fork. 
The movement to keep "Ethereum Classic" alive as a separate coin only really became a thing **after** the fork had occurred, the return of hashrate and it's addition to exchanges happened well after the fork, hence why multiple exchanges were caught flat-footed and were drained of their ETC (that was supposed to be meaningless/worthless)
Coinbase, BTC-E and QuadrigaCX each lost substantial amounts of ETC as people withdrew Ethereum post-fork and received both ETH &amp; ETC.

Because moving around USD is slow, whereas Tether moves at the speed of Bitcoin. 
Tether isn't useful for someone who just wants to buy or sell Bitcoin once, it's for traders. 
Doing BTC or altcoin arbitrage between exchanges via USD is super slow, whereas using USDT in place of fiat allows for dozens if not hundreds of round-trips from exchange to exchange in the time it would take for even a single bankwire withdrawal, never mind the full trip with your bank acct in the middle and then a deposit to a second exchange. 
There is tremendous money to be made off of arbitrage by maintaining the tight price spread between Bitfinex, Poloniex, Bittrex, Kraken &amp; Shapeshift, and Tether is one of the primary mechanisms traders are using. 
This is one of the reasons why there is typically a much larger spread between GDAX / Bitstamp and the other exchanges mentioned above, as without Tether the volume arbitrage traders can cycle through is constrained by the slow speed of USD. 


I don't have blind faith, I just understand the tremendous utility of something like Tether as a tool for traders, exchanges, etc... and the business &amp; profitability model seems reasonable for Tether. 
If we accept their claims at face value, they have +1.6 Billion USD sitting in bank accounts and their customers paid them 0.2% when depositing it and will pay another 0.2% when they withdraw USD. 
They made over 1M USD in just the past month off the fees, plus any interest they may be earning on +1.6B of customer deposits sitting in banks. (I have no idea interest earnings look like on this scale, lol)




The whales &amp; institutions that are their primary customers? sure, probably better than a class action.
The Bittrex bank wire Tether purchase info I linked in my prior post has a $100,000 USD minimum deposit. 


So... the traders holding Tether are going to panic sell? Okay, the only Tether markets with any significant liquidity &amp; volume are USDT/BTC &amp; USDT/ALTs, which means any exit from Tether tokens directly applies buy pressure to BTC and altcoins.

These aren't sales taxes on individual transactions, they are income taxes on gains, difference between value at time of receipt and time of sale.

Welcome to crypto, somehow people do so regularly. I don't see how this differs from most other exchanges, depositing to many exchanges often involves wiring funds to unusual overseas banks in exchange for tokens. 
A quick google search found me numerous reddit &amp; bitcointalk posts by people who've sent +$100,000 via bankwire to Bittrex to purchase USDT, most complaining about the delays in them receiving the wires / crediting USDT. 
Also it's worthwhile to remember that Tether &amp; Bitfinex have some overlapping ownership, and likely share many of the same fiat banking relationships. You described it as collusion earlier, but frankly... the close ties to Bitfinex seem like more of a plus than a negative when it comes to Tether's credibility, more likely to be legit if it's intimately involved of the  volume Bitcoin exchange

You said "Their website clearly states you can't redeem", I have proven that their website actually clearly states that they **are redeemable**. 
It explicitly talks of a contractual right to have Tether redeemed absent any legal reasons prohibiting it. 




Can you explain to me why practically everything you say appears to be blatantly incorrect?

@_date: 2018-01-19 01:19:44


Actually, it very clearly sets forth terms for customers redeeming Tethers for real money.
Hell, the [fees page]( even includes fees for withdrawing to a Bank Account!
I think this sentence sums it up well: 
**Absent a reasonable legal justification not to redeem Tether Tokens, and provided that you are a fully verified customer of Tether, your Tether Tokens are freely redeemable.**
There's a whole section of their terms that goes over the various details, essentially stating that they will redeem Tethers for verified customers so long as they are not legally forbidden from doing so: 








any applicable Laws, including but not limited to Applicable AML/CTF Laws, Applicable ABAC Laws, or Applicable Sanctions Laws. Tether also reserves the right to issue or redeem Tether Tokens upon receipt of any  subpoena, request for information, or order under applicable Laws or from any Government or Government Official, including but not limited to any domestic or international law enforcement authority. **Absent a reasonable legal justification not to redeem Tether Tokens, and provided that you are a fully verified customer of Tether, your Tether Tokens are freely redeemable.**




Seems to be pretty clear that fully verified customers who are not violating the law have the right to redeem tethers for the money they are backed by. 


Tether isn't using it's profits to operate the peg, that doesn't make any sense. Tether's profit is from fiat deposit &amp; withdrawal fees (0.2%).

Tether actually uses the Bitcoin Blockchain, it's a layer built on top, the transactions quite literally move at the speed of Bitcoin. 


As I described, the greatly increased speed of using USDT instead of USD for cross-exchange arbitrage allows an arbitrage trader to potentially do 10-100x more volume over a given timeframe, amplifying their profits accordingly. 
It turns a potentially multi-week process for moving USD back and forth between Bitfinex/Polo/Kraken/Bittrex/Binance into mere minutes/hours. 
It doesn't really qualify as "wash trading" if the traders are taking advantage of the spread and making profits doing so. 


Those huge addresses are the wallets for Bittrex, Huobi, Binance, Poloniex, Kraken, etc... holding customer deposits.
As for "collusion between bitfinex, and likely a coupe other exchanges and tether." I would expect close relationships between exchanges and a service like Tether, and in some ways it's a good sign that there is ownership overlap between Tether and the highest volume Bitcoin exchange.


Okay... so here's the thing. If people are depositing USD and receiving Tether, then there is no dumping of "play money", and the inflation of supply does not decrease purchasing power. 
It's also kind of weird to describe Tether as being "dumped", since the only purposes are purchasing BTC/alts or using as collateral for margin trading, so any "dumped tether" most likely results in increased crypto prices. 
Obviously 500m/day would be absurd, that would double Tether's total supply in just a few days. But 1000m over several months, during an insane BTC/alt bullrun? 
Not unbelievable. 


Obviously I've considered the very real possibility of a scam, but as a longtime trader I'm also keenly aware of the usefulness of a tool like Tether for various types of trading behavior. Tether is filling a legitimately useful role and there is a realistic business/profit model, there is a real possibility all is genuine. 
And frankly, I've noticed a pattern that the people most convinced that Tether is a blatant scam appear to know little of the ins &amp; outs of crypto trading, arbitrage, etc... Makes sense really, the less you understand of it's usefulness the more scammy it seems.

I selected ~160sat/byte as a custom fee. 
The wallet adjusted that for Segwit behind the scenes to give comparable priority, but it never displayed the actual resulting sat/byte figure, not even on the confirm screen. 
This is somewhat confusing, and it could be easily resolved by having the client display both.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:20:59


I would argue that doing it right would involve also showing us fee values using the typical satoshi/byte standards that the rest of the community relies on, instead of just showing us the Segwit-discounted ones that aren't directly comparable to mempool charts. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:18:03
It may work, but it's certainly not very user friendly.
I attempted to intentionally overpay on fees to get prompt inclusion (+160 sat/byte when mempool was emptying 100-140) and ended up with ~80 sat/byte. 
It thankfully ended up included within the hour... but it certainly is confusing to see the app show a specific user-selected sat/byte figure, repeat that same sat/byte figure on the confirmation page... and then see block explorers show a wildly different lower value. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:23:49

@_date: 2017-12-31 17:58:39
I'm not interested in blanket overpayment, it would just be nice to have the wallet express both the effective priority and real fee figures, instead of telling me I'm selecting ~160 sat/byte, asking for confirmation of this, and then submitting using a much lower sat/byte figure. 
I understand that it's effectively the same priority due to Segwit, but still I have a problem with a transaction confirmation screen that asks permission for one thing, and then does something slightly different.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:16:15
It's primarily exchanges doing batched transactions from what I can see. 
Poloniex is regularly spending +1000 sat/byte on batched customer withdrawals, and spending +400 sat/byte when sweeping deposit addresses. 
I saw one the other day at +1400 sat/byte!
Bitfinex also seems to exceed 600 sat/byte for batched withdrawals when it doesn't need to.

It's theoretically possible, but both of them appear to be fraudsters, and there appears to have been a fair bit of legal maneuvering and documents that show *claims* of bitcoin ownership, a trust, etc... but this is Bitcoin, where claiming ownership in a legal document is irrelevant if you lack the keys. 
Likewise with transferring the legal ownership of bitcoin without moving them. 
A contract transferring ownership might be legally valid, it just totally defeats the purpose of bitcoin
The best explanation I've seen thus far is that he's fabricated/greatly exaggerated these large bitcoin holdings on paper, and has since been making various attempts to exploit this by trying to borrow against his "assets", claim R&amp;D tax rebates by "spending" the coins on paper (without moving them), or to con others into business deals

From what I understand it's still functionally "in the blockchain" same as before, it's just kind of arbitrarily defining the signature data as being "outside" the block of transactions and thus not constrained by the limit.

Of course, but it's to the bitcoin community's detriment given the fact that there's so much overlap between the various communities. Kill the doge and all those people have still been exposed to cryptocurrency, have told others, etc...

And yet... for the bulk of the last year ROI for GPU mining rigs has ended up being less than 3 months.

Only if you managed to hold onto those Bitcoin through an incredible amount of market volatility. 
One of the upsides of GPU mining rigs is that you essentially cannot sell prematurely, the coin just keeps coming.

That is one potential outcome. All that is certain is that there are ~3600 fresh coins generated each day, which if all sold would require ~1.1 million USD to purchase. This rate of new coin generation will continue until the next halving in early 2016. Other than that, one must speculate. 
It's entirely about supply and demand. If demand for bitcoin at +$313 exceeds the amount people are willing to sell at these prices then prices rise. 
If the supply of coin people want to sell at these prices exceeds demand for long enough, prices fall.

GPU mined altcoins are much like bitcoin was in 2012, something that virtually anyone can actually still be involved in in a meaningful way, without gambling on +6 month preorders for multi-thousand dollar specialized equipment that's useless for any other purpose. 
I think introducing a great many people to the world of cryptocurrency in a way that gets them involved and excited can only help cryptocurrency in the long term, and even just keeping hobbyist mining viable for an additional year of exposure was something deserving of mention.

I'm not pumping anything, I came here for the MSI discussion, what with them making both GPUs and excellent mining motherboards. 
I'm just pointing out that has always had an unfriendly elitist attitude towards it's competition, be it LTC, FTC, XPM, DOGE, etc.... 
Frankly, seems like it's to the community's detriment more than it's benefit, considering the small army of alienated GPU miners who are all users of bitcoin in addition to supporters of LTC or whatever other alts. I've been a bitcoin enthusiast and GPU miner for a year now, yet somehow scrypt is still some pesky fad to be ignored? I don't get it. 


And none of those were considered "worthy" of being considered "non-bitcoin communities" for the wiki by whatever arbitrary criteria is being used either.
It's easy to say Doge brought nothing unique from a technical standpoint, but it's another thing to say out of all the altcoins only Namecoin and Ripple's reddit communities deserve mention, given their meager sizes. 
Hell, even just and each have ~4x the subscribers, never mind their parent communities....

Bitcoin Classic is still vaporware at this point tho, at this point all we really have is people vaguely supporting the *concept* of larger blocks, without any real details as to implementation. 
what exactly "Bitcoin Classic" will consist of still doesn't appear to have any consensus

I believe he's talking about mine operators that shutdown early generation ASICs and upgraded their facilities to new rigs like the s5. Efficiency is certainly up, but they've just invested in fresh hardware, and efficiency gains do not go all that far when prices are down +30% this month. 


All it takes is a few big players who realize they can make more on a combination of leveraged shorts + sudden mass sales ahead of the waterfall than they could at relatively stable prices in the $310 range. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 15:16:30
Sure there are, many alts have used a variety of methods to resist ASIC development with varying degrees of success
Ethereum for example requires large and steadily increasing amounts of RAM (1.3GB and growing) and performance is latency limited, making the vast arrays of small ASIC chips in miners far less viable since each needs low-latency access to a large memory pool.  
@_date: 2016-03-07 17:54:56
Some people seem to assume that Core is fully in Blockstream's pocket, and that because Adam Back and a few core devs signed the agreement that means all of Core must inevitably fall in line behind them.
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:06:29


My suspicion is that much of this support for Classic is really support for the concept of a 2MB block hardfork, much like the previous round of surveys that showed widespread support among miners for a move to 2MB. 
2MB blocks likely do have majority support, but I'd be very surprised if that majority was also supportive of the switch to an entirely different and unproven devteam (and loss of multiple core devs) just to get them
Even here on there are tons who think Classic is just a 2MB patch for Core, who seem to have missed the part about a major change in dev "leadership", the exclusion of opt-in RBF, etc...

Good to hear your view of the developer perspective, my access to such devs is limited to the occasional reddit comment
The problem is that there is a significant fraction of non-developers who see it as a plausible scenario, and they've twisted themselves into such a frenzy that everything is viewed through a colored lens set to conspiracy
I for one don't buy into the conspiracy, but I can see how other more skeptical individuals might view aspects as plausible, especially given Bitcoin's heavy anti-establishment undercurrent.
To be clear, among the conspirators it seems the 'full blown evil' view appears much the minority, it seems more fear that the goals have shifted away from the smaller users towards bigger financial interests, hence the investment by arms of such large financial entities. 


I've seen far too many impassioned posts to disregard them all, there does appear to be numerous people who seem convinced in their beliefs that Blockstream is in control or setting direction for Core and is stalling for stalling's sake, pushing for otherwise legitimate technical proposals ahead of the larger block limit they believe is so urgently important. 
At the same time.... I'd imagine few if any would still be complaining if the various technical proposals were occurring after a 2MB hardfork, instead of before. 
Hell... the bulk off the Classsic Roadmap seems to be just nonspecific references to improvements the core devs are working on or mention in the Core Roadmap
@_date: 2016-03-04 02:45:03
He's saying that it serves as a convenient excuse, while at the same time being bullshit from a technical standpoint.
If their transactions keep getting stuck, they need to adapt and stop being cheapskates on the fees (or perhaps STOP MINING EMPTY BLOCKS)
Much like transaction malleability, it sounds like a plausible excuse, but in reality was just a scapegoat for other incompetence
@_date: 2016-01-21 00:05:07
From what I've read the problem is the possibility of very large/complex "individual" transactions being constructed, which due to their size/complexity require far longer to process (over 10min to validate the transaction)
it's briefly mentioned in the [core roadmap here]( although one of the devs went into far more detail in one of the recent big discussion threads in past couple days, just don't recall which one
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:50:45


The negativity is based more around motive than it is the technical side, many fear or assume you, Blockstream and/or Core have been tainted or corrupted by the large corporate financiers, or that the money came with potentially concerning strings attached that we are not privy to. 
This fear means many are unwilling to see the various technological proposals from Core as being entirely genuine, since they're tainted by this assumption that the motives of "Blockstream Core" have been altered by the mainstream financial industry backing.

I'm uncertain regarding statements since the recent agreement, IIRC there may have been a few not present who expressed their agreement in the various announcement threads, but I'm too lazy to go digging. 
However... to extend on my prior comment, the original 'core roadmap' text with the +50 core devs agreement actually does mention a 2MB hardfork after segwit (in particular it mentions 2-4-8 rescaled to Segwit), as well as dynamic blocksize proposals.
As such, I feel that many "on the other side" are mischaractarizing the position of the core devs in regards to hard fork blocksize increases

be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.](

@_date: 2016-01-20 23:52:30


Everyone is on board with 2MB blocks at some point, the ambiguity is with timeframe and how the question has been framed. Much of the "support for classic" thus far from major players seems more to be support for the idea of a hardfork to 2MB.
On one hand "Classic" claims to be just core + a 2MB patch, but on the other hand it's also a radical departure from the existing devteam structure, with potentially different long term plans... which isn't necessarily completely obvious at first glance.
I have no doubt miners expressed agreement with 2MB blocks, I have huge doubts that there is consensus for ditching the core roadmap and going with a new devteam

People are making estimates based on things like the adoption of previously introduced softforks like P2SH, or the number of active nodes running older versions, and then applying that to segwit's adoption. 
The softfork for BIP16 P2SH activated back in 2012, and it took a long time for the whole Bitcoin ecosystem to upgrade to support it's new address format. 
On the other hand... the witness data discount from BIP141 Segwit offers more of an incentive to promptly upgrade wallets than past softforks, particularly to those who use the network most frequently.
For BIP 16, activation was kind of useless until the whole ecosystem of wallets supported sending to the new address format, whereas it's possible to take advantage of the size/fee discount from Segwit even when sending to existing P2SH addresses of non-segwit wallets.
After activation, people who start sending segwit transactions can get a transaction size/fee discount without requiring others to upgrade, since segwit transactions can be sent to any address beginning with 3 (P2SH), and it falls back to normal transactions without discount when sending to older format addresses. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 19:29:12
Will be very interesting to see if they take the middle road. The community could very well go with the softfork to invalidate the coins, but decide not to hardfork to reissue fresh coins to repay the DAO losses.
This would insulate non-DAO holders of ETH, confining losses to those who chose to participate in the DAO and accepted the risks. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 01:04:44
People on the other side regularly argue that segwit would be better, simpler, cleaner as a hardfork, yet don't seem to offer much to support their claims. 
I haven't actually seen anyone explain, on a technical level, what particular aspects would be simpler or cleaner. From what I can tell none of the devs on that side have written any code for a hardfork variant, I've not seen any examples of particular sections of the specification that could be done better, cleaner, etc...
Meanwhile, Segwit as softfork is essentially finished and currently undergoing detailed review. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 23:09:37




There are plenty of real people in the opposing camps, and there's no need to assume an organized brigade when tensions on this topic are so inflamed (the other side makes brigade accusations as well)
It's somewhat understandable why the theory that big finance has managed to subvert Bitcoin's development by their major investment in Blockstream has received some traction given the Bitcoin community's natural lean towards libertarianism, anti-authoritarianism and anti-centralized finance, and the various related conspiracy theories that go along with it. 
I mean... I knew the second I saw the words 'Bilderberg group' mentioned that there would *always* be some segment that will remain convinced there's some big conspiracy at work. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:43:01
It seems there's a worthwhile distinction to make between adoption in terms of users who've upgraded and adoption in % of transactions. 
Use of segwit by just a few percent of Bitcoin's total users could still theoretically make them the bulk of total transactions, if those users are the businesses, exchanges, etc... making high-volume use of the blockchain.

I agree, but there is no set in stone figure for that, nor for the fee floor.

Indeed. 
What I'm saying is that witness segregation, a new transaction type, a malleability fix, quadratic fix, etc... do not **require** the specific "weighted cost + new max size" approach that Core has chosen. 
Creating a second bucket does not seem to require different weighting for each, nor does it seem to require expanding capacity.

The issue here is that you attribute this manipulation to "the people who control the exchanges", instead of to traders &amp; people operating bots. 
I mean sure, pumps or dumps often include individual traders or groups making coordinated actions on several exchanges, but the price rising / falling near simultaneously on all exchanges is expected behavior in an ecosystem where traders have bots running watching exchanges for sudden movements, volume spikes, etc... 
It's all about arbitrage, if the price on any particular exchange spikes ahead of the rest then bots (and attentive traders) buy low on any other exchanges that have yet to move, or haven't spiked as high. 
This is all super noticeable in altcoin markets, where price swings from individual whales are larger, and where the common currency is BTC which they can easily move between exchanges. 
Bot sits with piles of BTC + ALT on any two or more exchanges. If price on either exchange rapidly spikes, sell high &amp; immediate rebuy on another exchange, then equalizes the size of each pile later on, to prepare for next opportunity. Rinse, repeat.

What I'm saying is that it's the new block weight variables &amp; calculations which give Core's Segwit it's capacity increase, rather than being an inherent &amp; requisite part of segregating witness data to fix malleability/quad hashing
MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT 
These are what ultimately give Segwit it's capacity increase, but configuring them as BIP 141 Segwit does is not required to fix malleability, nor quadratic hashing. 


Well... only to a point, they certainly cannot exceed the constraints imposed by the softfork. 


Oh totally, I understand &amp; support the reasoning behind it, I'm just pointing out that witness segregation to fix the bugs does not *require* complex block weight calculations. (even though they do make sense)

And it would also be impossible to produce without being self-mined by a miner or pool, since transactions that large are not relayed. 
They would also have to sacrifice an entire block worth of fees to do so, and risk having that block orphaned by smaller blocks from other miners. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 10:15:06


They'd be able to produce blocks according to their hashrate, just as they would if mining honestly. 
The "losses inflicted while trying to do so" = the cost of carrying out the attack, which for soon to be retired gear might only be ~$10k per block mined, a small price to pay for such an attack and/or short attempt. (and even less if you account for selling the block reward)
All Bitcoin mining gear is inevitably rendered obsolete at some point, viewing miners in the final few weeks before hardware is shutoff as broke and "struggling" seems to be missing the point entirely, these are people who've already made a complete return on their investment and likely a very healthy profit. 


The time it would take to mine the block would be largely irrelevant, exchange APIs could be used to to place the leveraged shorts when the block is successfully mined, yet before the rest of the community noticed. 
Of course... all of this is meaningless since none of the proposed paths forward for Bitcoin would leave this vulnerability open.

The two rounds of public funding were $21 million USD and $55 million USD, there's no need to exaggerate by 140% 


It could theoretically occur after just a couple months. 
It seems entirely unfair to assume that a hardfork to 2MB would somehow achieve prompt 100% adoption, while at the same time assuming a glacially slow pace for adoption/use of Segwit.


This is not the case.
Segwit is designed in such a way that an un-upgraded node can still interact with the network (send &amp; receive coin), and is still capable of understanding certain aspects of Segwit transactions, despite not understanding the witness portion. 
Softforks are an intentional part of Bitcoin's design, existing nodes are entirely aware that there are new rules which they cannot interpret, but they can still verify that the incoming coins are valid from a UTXO standpoint.

Your argument seems to be that we can leave a potential vulnerability unfixed because we can trust miners to only want what's best for Bitcoin's value.
And yet... all three Bitcoin development teams have a fix or workaround for this concern.
All I'm saying is that there exist plausible scenarios where individuals have more to gain from short-term sabotage than they do by earnestly mining using older and inefficient gear that produces far less BTC than it costs in electric. 
There's also the possibility of someone who has zero investment in miners/BTC to gain temporary control of miners or a mining pool using hacks/malware/etc... and redirect the hashrate for malicious purposes. (I can recall a few such hijacks over the years)

Interesting perspective.
I made the argument because it seems like many critical of Segwit are pointing to the potential +3MB blocks as a serious "attack" risk, seemingly unaware or ignoring the considerable costs and effort involved in producing such jumbo blocks. 
I'm kind of puzzled what you mean though, as Segwit's design solves the sigops attack issue organically, by making much of the signature hashing redundant (reducing scaling from quadratic to linear) there's no need for a new fixed cap on sigops per block (as used in BIP109 / Cl assic) or a fixed cap on individual transaction size (as used by Bitcoin Un limited)

A new structure alongside the existing transaction merkle tree, and implemented via the coinbase field.
Part of the block, yet not violating the existing max_block_size ruleset old nodes follow. 


They cannot validate the signature aspect, all they can do is ensure the coins themselves are genuine (from a UTXO / coin supply perspective)
But... that's part of the brilliance of Bitcoin's soft-fork mechanism, legacy nodes *are aware* that there are new rules they cannot understand, and so will not accept or relay loose transactions using those new rules (and won't include them into blocks if mining)
It is only after such transactions are validated by miners and included in blocks that a legacy node would receive and consider them valid, essentially outsourcing the signature validation stage to the network as a whole.

What do you see as the remaining technical roadblocks to a potential increase in non-witness data, assuming segwit activation? 
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:15:28


Why do you say that? 
The malleability &amp; quadratic hashing fixes come from segregating the witness data, not the capacity increase resulting from the new block weight calculations themselves. 
Seems like it would be straightforward to remove the weighting difference between witness/nonwitness data and adjust calculations to ensure Segwit blocks do not exceed 1MB. 
Giving witness data a "discount" makes sense to me, but does not seem inherently required for the malleability/quadratic hashing fixes. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:04:20


Segwit blocks will be capable of exceeding 1MB. They will hold more transactions, require more bandwidth, etc... 
The potential additional capacity is very real, it's just not fully understood by old nodes.
Instead of replacing a 1000 page book with a 2000 page book, they've bundled a second book along with it and sorted the info a bit. More total pages, more content, added size and weight. 
And yet... the 1000 page book is unchanged in size/dimension, old nodes remain capable of reading it and all it's transactions much as they did before, they just do not understand the note on each transaction that says "see attached appendix for signature"

Even the most staunch small block proponents (luke-jr) have stated that the limit will need to go up at some point

@_date: 2016-11-30 19:35:23
Uhh... we've been talking about two entirely different kinds of "attack block" here.
SWSF fixes the sigops scaling issue, greatly boosting validation speed in certain scenarios so that such attack transactions no longer take hours to validate. 
It would still be possible to create 3.7 MB blocks filled with spam, but without the sigops issue the network handles them just fine, a rather meaningless and ineffectual attack that would not cause the market panic needed for a major short. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 20:10:04
But... the occasional, edge case +3MB block filled with spam has a rather different impact from a bandwidth and storage / UTXO growth standpoint from hardforked increases that allow blocks to consistently be +3MB
As such, I don't see it entirely hypocritical for someone to be arguing against a maxblocksize=4MB all while Segwit's worst-case-scenario can result in similarly sized blocks, since the potential for average blocksize varies greatly between the two proposals. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 17:46:32
First off, there is no "compression" involved with Segwit. 
A ~2MB Segwit block holds ~2MB of transactions, using ~2MB worth of of disk/bandwidth/etc.... it's just been organized in such a way that it does not violate max_block_size=1MB rule as understood by legacy nodes. 


The segregated location of witness data actually directly brings with it a variety of benefits. 
The transaction malleability fix is an obvious one. 
Bitcoin's existing design structure also involves quite a bit of repeat signature hashing, and by moving all of the witness data into a separate structure it makes some of this hashing entirely redundant, reducing signature validation load scaling with higher transaction volumes from quadratic to linear.
mentioned here: 
Without a fix for this issue, larger limits bring the potential to create blocks that literally take HOURS to validate. 
Bitcoin Cl assic / BIP 109 uses a crude workaround for the issue by adding a fixed cap on the # of sigops per block, all while Bitcoin Unl imited has chosen the "head in the sand" approach to this issue, and has no solution. 
Hell... they didn't even implement BIP109's limits, despite literally signalling for BIP109 by default. (this caused an unintended fork on testnet a few months back, their hardfork activation failed when tested)
The separate location also enables a new partial form of pruning, allowing an old node to discard historical Signature data to save space all while still maintaining 100% of the UTXO, and thus the ability to validate the existence of Bitcoins all the way back to Genesis.
Obviously this isn't the same as full validation, but it seems an interesting new possibility. 


The only proposal that I've seen that comes close to *actual compression* would be aggregated schnorr signatures. 
It is proposed by Greg Maxwell, and builds upon/makes use of the segregated witness data structure, as I understand it by aggregating signatures in such a way that multiple transactions involving the same signature only involve storing each signature once in the block.

But that doesn't mean the vulnerability should be ignored, Bitcoin cannot rely on good faith alone. 
The ability to short Bitcoin with leverage opens up the potential for all sorts of actions and/or attacks by miners that otherwise would not be rational or economically viable.
What about a miner who invested in previous-generation ASICs some time ago and that has already achieved ROI?
For someone with gear that's barely profitable to run, launching an attack could very well make more economic sense than mining for another month at marginal profitability before retirement. 
Or... someone with mining gear that's already slightly below break-even point? No hope of profit directly, yet still able to produce blocks so still able to attack, if there were a vulnerability.

Seems pretty damn misleading to call a 3.7MB block of spam "highly disruptive" in a discussion that also includes max sigops attacks with multi-hour validation. 
What impacts would this "highly disruptive" block have? Oh yeah... worst case scenario impact for an individual block would be similar to a 3.7MB hardforked block.... in fact potentially even less disruptive since it cannot bloat UTXO to the same extent.

Naw, you can't check your account balance that way.
Once deposited, there's no way to tell what is yours and what isn't yours via the blockchain. 
Your Poloniex deposit address is automatically swept after each deposit (at the same moment the deposit is credited on-site), the coins moved to different address and tossed into piles along with others coins.

Don't forget, here's what the "Core Roadmap" said about bigger blocks in the future:


be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
\(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase\). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them.

If we're both thinking of the same thread, I believe Maaku was referring to segwit + 2MB being too much for the current network


yup, the argument is that a segwit + 1MB block filled with nothing but complex multisignature transactions could theoretically be equivalent to a +3MB non-segwit block from a total bandwidth perspective


Part of the segwit implementation involves changes and improved scaling of signature hashing, which seems to reduce the bottleneck that was allowing the potential giant/complex transaction node overload issue/attack
I don't think this changes the bandwidth impact, but it does make running equivalently larger blocks considerably lower impact from a processing standpoint than without segwit

The problem here is that many of the big "mining pool operators" also literally manufacture and run mining equipment as well, so it's hard to separate the two. 
Antpool's not just *a pool*, it's BitMain's pool. Bitfury, KNC, etc... all have significant hashpower directly under their control, not just 3rd party miners utilizing their pools. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 21:51:34


From what I understand Gavin's new code is just a cap on total sigops, where as the segwit changes actually make the signature hashing process dramatically more efficient by reducing the scaling from quadratic to linear
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:03:53


This of course assumes that the entire Core team is totally fine with a hostile fork of their project, and are still eager to contribute even after they've been rejected as a development team. 
Otherwise there does not appear to be any actual *long-term* scaling solution to be had with Classic, since blocksize increases by themselves just kick the can down the road a tad.

ASICs were so devastating to home miners because of the rapid succession of generations, with the early ones being huge increases in efficiency/hashrate
GPU mining is a much more level playing field, and we see efficiency gains *very infrequently* (most recent being 2012 and the 7950/7970) 
I'm not exaggerating when I say a circa 2012-2013 GPU mining rig is actually slightly *better* than a circa 2016 one, comparable components are more expensive now, and current gen GPUs are slightly inferior variants less suited for mining (narrower memory bus)

100% of AMD and Nvidia's current desktop GPU lineup are 28nm, both are still at least 4-6 months off from even their earliest 14nm releases


Large-scale deployment does scale better and would improve profit margins, but it's absolutely nothing like what occurred with ASICs and bitcoin since the professionals don't get a large and ever increasing hashrate &amp; energy efficiency advantage vs home scale miners. 
A circa 2013 GPU mining rig built for LTC is still able to mine a variety of coins **profitably** today in 2016 at typical residential electric rates, and is on par with one you'd build today for mining
@_date: 2016-02-03 19:18:32


Okay... Segwit is essentially a multiplier of the blocksize limit, variable based on the type/complexity of the transactions in the block
By moving the signature data outside of the "block" and counting it differently, we get a potential ~1.7x* capacity increase compared to the same blocksize limit without segwit.
So... Segwit + a 1MB block limit = potential for up to ~1.7MB of non-multisig transactions
Segwit + a 2MB block limit = ~3.4MB
Segwit + a 4MB block limit = ~6.8MB
this 1.7x figure assumes widespread adoption of segwit and current typical transactions, but blocks full of more complex multisig transactions could theoretically see up to an effective 4x increase
hence maaku's claims, a 2MB block limit plus segregated witness would give us up to 3.4MB capacity for non-multisig transactions, and the potential for blocks up to 8MB in size if multisig transactions become more common (or if someone creates a ton of them as an attack)

They invested into their own profit, each successive generation of ASIC does little if anything to increase Bitcoin's "security", if anything it makes Bitcoin *less secure* by driving existing ASICs closer to obsolescence and concentrating hashrate in the hands of those with access to the latest hardware. 
Bitcoin would be just as secure running 45nm or 32nm ASIC chips, the ridiculous expense in pushing the efficiency envelope does nothing for anyone besides the miners, hell... it doesn't even necessarily reduce overall energy consumption of the network

That's the thing... hashrate is all relative, and based entirely on the algorithm chosen.
For say... Ethereum, per-GPU hashrates are in the 15-30Mh/s range, it would take like 40 beefy GPUs each worth +$300 to equal a single gigahash. But... that's okay, since the total network hashrate is thousands of GH

Core's Roadmap literally says dynamic blocksize limit proposals "will be critically important long term" :


incentive-aligned **dynamic block size controls** based on allowing miners
to produce larger blocks at some cost. These proposals help preserve
the alignment of incentives between miners and general node operators,
and prevent defection between the miners from undermining the fee
market behavior that will eventually fund security. I think that right
now capacity is high enough and the needed capacity is low enough that
we don't immediately need these proposals, but **they will be critically
important long term.** I'm planning to help out and drive towards a more

A spin on the classic "I have millions of dollars, which I can't access for... *reasons*, so I'm gonna need investors" ploy

It's touted for trades but how can a non real time payment process exist in a real time trade environment
Very little in banking is truly real-time. Settlement in mainstream banking still involves considerable delays, be it for large transactions or credit card.
Everyone thinks a credit card is instant, but the reality is even after approved the merchant does not actually receive the funds for quite some time.

It's unfortunate that the only markets offering BCC futures are brand new low volume exchanges with no track record, would be nice to offload them now while they still have value.

What's surprising is that GPU mining altcoins is just about as viable as it was last year, and all using the same circa 2012-2013 equipment.
A GPU mining rig from 2012 is essentially competitive against one built this year, AMD's still using the same 28nm process so efficiency hasn't changed much

New miners have been happy to invest in Ethereum mining rigs, even though we all know that it'll be switching fully to PoS at some point, rendering all that hardware useless for Ethereum mining. 
Keep in mind, GPU mining gear investment isn't anywhere near as risky as ASICs, since even if 100% of GPU mining died tomorrow all of the hardware would still retain at least half of it's value on the used market.
Oh, and most of the gear is commercial off the shelf and widely available (no pre-orders), with 3yr warranty typical for GPUs, mobos, etc... 5-10yr for power supples

Ehh... not quite. 
It was an altcoin with a brand new chain, and with coins seeded in random amounts to Bitcoin, Litecoin and Doge addresses, and as I recall an active claiming mechanism.
I'm not familiar with any attempts to actually fork Bitcoin's chain and keep the genesis, block history, proper balances, etc... most just do some sort of airdrop distribution.

The proposed new address format for Segwit in BIP142 is optional, and BIP141 Segwit does not require it to function. 
BIP141 Segwit makes use of P2SH format addresses (added back in 2012)
people using old P2PKH format addresses will need new ones to see direct benefits from Segwit, but the design includes transaction backwards compatibility with old addresses and existing bitcoin software (as long as it understands BIP 16 from 2012)

Well... no, dogecoin isn't a fork/clone of Bitcoin, nor does it share the same historical network state or balances.

So... we have an "anti-censorship" community eager to downvote anything that strays from the sub's popular narrative, complete with a secret automod policy that removes all comments by users with -50 or less total comment karma. 
Even if you have positive karma elsewhere, that's where the automated comment rate-limiting kicks in based on negative subreddit-specific karma.
This seems fitting:

Coins have made successful PoW algorithm switches before without incident, I can think of several examples. 
None on the financial scale of Bitcoin obviously, but there's nothing preventing it from a technical standpoint, and if push comes to shove it's certainly a possibility.
After all... if the choice is the minority chain **dying**, and the minority chain having reduced theoretical security for some period of time as mining infrastructure is rebuilt/redeployed? It seems like an obvious choice from the minority chain's perspective. 
Ethereum Classic has over 25,000 GPUs presently mining, even though it came into being less than a week ago and wasn't even intended by the devs. "Bitcoin" with an alternate PoW would have far, far more support.

It's actually 120 confirms for ETC on Polo (36 for ETH)
I'm not denying there is a security risk involved in doing so... but allowing the minority chain to **die entirely** seems a far bigger risk to the value of that minority chain than the security tradeoffs that come with a PoW algorithm switch.

This isn't a subreddit karma issue, the rule was a blanket block targeting all users with -50 total comment karma. Even users who had never been downvoted here before were affected, regardless of the quality of what they intend to post here. 
Even if it was based on subreddit-specific karma (as the 10min post rate limit is) it would still be a huge issue because it's being done in secret, and everyone's so adamant about how this place is anti-censorship.
Even the mods were denying there was censorship a few weeks back during the 10min rate limit discussion, and now we find out that they've got a secret second layer running that's even worse?
It's also effortless to rack up downvotes here when arguing the other side, even for quality well-cited posts.

And to actually determine that using those indicators requires the two forks to survive &amp; coexist in functional/viable states, but Bitcoin's design does not accommodate this without radical change.

By petition for scaling code changes, do you mean 2MB hardfork? Yes, Core has disagreed with an urgent 2MB hardfork &amp; BIP109
Or do you mean other more technical proposals to improve Bitcoin's capability to scale, from various efficiency standpoints?
Actually making Bitcoin more capable of handling higher transaction volume (more compact transactions, less CPU load per transaction, less data transmitted, reduced latency, etc...) is challenging development work, and I'm not familiar with any efforts in this area that have been rejected or blocked.


The problem here is that people on the other side see Core's rejection of an urgent 2MB (or larger) hardfork as being a total rejection of **all** outside development work, even though nobody's really submitting anything else.
Xthin blocks is interesting, but the team behind XThin Blocks chose not to work with Core, and did not submit their code as a BIP proposal at all. Hence, not rejected or blocked.

The problem is the sheer volume of downvotes that a politely expressed opinion can attract there when it's contrary to the narrative. 
Even fact-based posts with quotes/links often suffer the same fate.

Well duh? 
Any malleability fix only applies to the new transaction format. 
It's not possible to completely fix transaction malleability without prohibiting old format transactions, so long as the network supports legacy format transactions they will continue to be malleable.
