I've tried to use Coinmarketcap's API but it's slightly differently formatted as the hitbtc and bitstamp apis, where you need to go into the first item of the json array,, I can't figure out how to do this in an AppleScript though.. has anyone else got this to work?

works like a charm :) thanks a lot!
Not sure if its proper but as I'm in a locale where the comma is set as a delimiter instead of a period, I've added one line to make it work here: set json to findAndReplaceInText(json, ".", ",")
