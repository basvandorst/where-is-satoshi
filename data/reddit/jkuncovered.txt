Why don't you? Just buy more bitcoin. Everything under 1000 isn't worth buying a nano. You likely won't make enough profits to pay that back.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:13:25
I second this
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:34:52
Don't. That's not worth it. At all.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:44:44
Yes but I kind of agree with the fact that Bitcoin has the highest chance of being THE currency. Not many can compete. On the points I described, Bitcoin is irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:11:54
Btc is the only cryptoCURRENCY. There is so much more out there than currencies; smart contracts, supplychain, distributed storage, digital voting.....the list goes on.
How can some people say they want a BTC dominance of 100%? I can't understand.

Haha this is great! Thanks for the laugh.
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:17:42
RemindMe! 10 days
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:45:37
Wow that is some dope sh*t! How did you recover it??
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:29:05
There is a bug in your software. HODL!
@_date: 2018-11-30 11:31:49
High quality post. Thanks.

For every answer I give, I am scared to be banned on one of those subreddits.....
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:41:31
Must be the worst joke (try) I ever saw.
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:48:26
Haha all this fud is just so funny.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:31:40
Is this the reason for the pump?
@_date: 2018-04-02 09:28:09
This is not the place. Go and find real life support if you're real.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:33:25
I'm scared just now. $850 increase within 15 minutes. We'll see what happens.
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:24:54
Hahaha this is great
@_date: 2018-04-16 09:48:26
You know in which other project he believes? VeChain!
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:29:01
And there it is. Your balance. Out in the open....Smart choice!
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:06:04
Doubt it.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:23:47
I went all in two years ago. Does it matter?
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:46:09
No one knows. You would be worlds richest man. Congratz.
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:36:53
I pray for you.
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:25:05
And that, I understand. Let's see what happens -_-
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:01:35
Sounds scammy as hell
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:33:56
Everything is possible in crypto and mysteries.
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:52:11
We have a deal!
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:58:41
This is perfectly normal. For Bitcoin. You've seen the ride up to 20k? Wasn't a smooth price increase, was it?
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:26:49
What was the hackers adress? Interesting to see how much others are losing money the same way you did.
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:30:44
Omg. Never though of this, but i like the idea. I'm gonna find out if this can be fixed in a smart contract! Will come back to you.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:05:11
Soo fake
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:36:14
And it will destroy the market once again. Or China is back in and we normies don't know it yet, or this is some sick manipulation.
@_date: 2018-04-16 10:21:31
That's old already.
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:22:35
Care to explain what that is?
