Bitcoin is the most secure network in the world.
It appears to work using Metcalfs law, google it.
We are likely at the cross roads between the value really going parabolic or a multi year bear market - hard to know.
Some of the most brilliant polymath minds on the planet are working on the tech.
Forget altcoins, they're only good until they reach scale then they'll collapse.
KimDotCom is involved and he will revolutionize Bitcoin.
Scratch the last one.

Isn't that like a DNS server in internet world? 
My understanding is it's like TCP/IP once enough people on the network you don't connect directly to YouTube you go via a series of hops, when LN gains critical mass there will already be a route..

Thanks Lisa
1.That's excellent news re the channel. I mistakenly thought you had to open and close the channel, writing to the blockchain each time and incurring a fee.
2. I totally get this point, great for enthusiasts, I think the masses wouldn't (or shouldn't) care what happens under the hood. Just like Netflix customers don't base their signup decision on the video compression algo being used, they just expect it to work.
3. Could you expand a little on this? How would the side chain affect the upfront 'stake' needed?

Some estimates here of people paying $20 fees here in worst case. This means $40 (2x $20). If the value of bitcoin doubles before LN released that takes us to the eighty.
I would pay max $20 annually upfront to use the network as i believe in and support the tech and the values of bitcoin.  I imagine a lot of people would pay $0.
Also Elizabeth Stark recently mentioned she didn't think buying coffee was a good use case for LN.
If it survived simply as a SOV, sound money and nothing more I would be happy. I would love it to be a currency too but it seems unlikely at this point.

It accelerates hyperbitcoinization in the long run.

Bitcoin is at this stage, problems will be fixed. Some of the best minds in the world are working on it. 
Give it time and have a little patience, it will change the world and its in its first innings as a technology.

Segwit will solve the problem in the short term, lightning could take a few years to get going and when It does it will wipe the floor and altcoins will crash.

THIS is the way the web should have been designed from the outset.
Publishers, artists and creatives fairly compensated for their output based on consumption, instead of the ad supported model.
This has HUGE ramifications for industry, it could literally revolutionize Facebook, Google and the entire web.
Imagine a world where artists get paid, where the best content rises to the top, where the best and bravest journalists are compensated and the corporate news media is starved of revenue as people will vote with their browser and consumption of honest journalism.
What amazing times we live in!

Couldn't agree more OP, it's kinda scary that people don't see what's going on here.
A lot of new investors will lose their shirts.
If I was a trader I would absolutely be executing this strategy to further my BTC position after missing out on buying early.
In the mid to long term however, as others point out. It will not be as easy to do this as the value increases and then the benefits will come to the hodlers. It will legitimize bitcoin.
It's a one shot deal for the traders they would be crazy not to take it.

I have a genuine question about LN.
My understanding is that in order to start you need to open a trade on chain pay fees of say $40+ maybe more in future and then close your channel at some point with another $40+ minimum.

We know we prefer bitcoin as its decentralized etc but it looks like they're now trying to setup competing alternative fed coins.
Could they offer the masses, instant payments, 'more secure' payments, exchange your fiat and we'll give you 1.5x your value in Fed coin?

I tend to agree with OP, it won't moon until Aug / Sep of next year. 
It won't be because of a financial crash though. The fed have been threatening to raise rates for the last few years, hasn't happened. The so-called trickle down economy will carry on for another few years with assets / stocks continuing to soar. The only bubble is in the stocks btw.
Bitcoin will start to moon once lightning network comes on stream and etfs get approved. It's going to be a fcking wild ride, you think 14k swing is tough? try 20k / 30k swings in a day, in hours. You'll need stones to get in / out alive.
Lightning network, unless there is a huge innovation / improvement won't cause value to rise because you can buy a cup of coffee, its value is in global credit / debit transfers. Also I believe we'll see a central bank buy up bitcoin in the next five years with others following suit.

1. Don't listen to advice from random strangers online.
2. Research everything.
3. Invest if you believe in the technology and not to make a quick buck.
4. If you are investing for the long term, work out your exit point so you don't sell at the wrong time and lose money or not achieve your goal. Read the sub here for plenty of stories of how users sold too early and regretted it.
5. For some, the exit point is to pay off all student debt, for others it's a house, for others it's a lambo, find your exit point.
6. See 1.

Great, thanks for explaining that, also interesting podcast with John Newbury on the latest Noded Bitcoin podcast explaining the same concept for those that are interested.
Had no idea the original code was so unfactored. Looks Ike they are spending a large part of dev time modularising the code and extracting the 'consensus' part into a separate area that shouldn't be touched. This allows them to update the node, wallet code without affecting the consensus piece.
Had no idea the original code was all bunged into a main.cpp file!

It's a fair point, cash out opportunities are going to come faster than people think.
Challenges here:
1. Exchange going down, could cause people to lose tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars if they don't get their order filled before an exchange crashes at key levels
2. Cash out limits. $10k per week seems a lot now but will be highly inconvenient if people are trying to cash out a multi hundred thousand dollar position in the not so distant future 
3. Will there be a better way to cash out in future if people start trying to cash out $500k positions?
How will the banks react? It seems there is a sliding scale of sh*t that people will need to traverse soon

I do find it hard to believe that wall st. had not played a hand in this today, like you said, perhaps they're going through Korean exchanges. 
If not then it's 'organic' growth and I'm a lot more optimistic short term on next weeks events..

I know very little admittedly about futures but the explanation above that it will merely reduce volatility sounds more correct to me.
It's exciting to think that it will shoot the price up but unless I'm mistaken futures contract != billions of new money coming in, just lots more bets on the current price within a e.g. $10k up / downswing..

Hey, thanks for the reply..
I'm not too concerned about buying now to acquire extra 2X coin, in my view far too much can go wrong by trying to offload it, I'm pretty tech savvy but don't want to play with fire and the risk of losing everything for +10% just isn't worth it.
Main concern is if I were to buy after the fork, how to know that I'm getting the legit core Dev coin, when it dips / if it dips and how long to leave it, which exchange to use to guarantee I'm not buying the 2X coin..
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:19:18

I agree that there are plenty of redditors doing their best to educate the wider community.
Why should the developers do anything?
Perhaps for the following reasons:
1. Likely they own bitcoin and don't want to see all their value go down the drain
2. They've worked on the project since its release or close. I imagine they would like to protect that workload otherwise all those hours invested would be for nothing
3. Nodes don't appear to be enough if the miners are being subsidized to deliberately disrupt BTC. For this reason the devs have special powers to invoke changes that will subvert this attack and should use them
4. It's now worth $120 billion. They may not care about the monetary value but if BTC can be taken over / centralized by interested parties then the radical dream of a decentralized currency will never come to pass.
I am hopeful the apathy displayed is because they have a clever way out of this, perhaps something better than POW change? Something we've not yet thought of?
Otherwise I believe their apathy is misplaced and they do not care about the above and / or they have grossly underestimated those who would seek to harm BTC.

In a purely logical world miners would mine the most profitable chain and the 2X issue would be done and dusted in days.
The problem is, the hard fork has turned into a political / power grab issue.
It is not beyond the realms of possibility that big miners are being underwritten by RV , big banks, interested parties that want to see the 1X chain fail.
This is the issue..
If there wasn't $100bn+ on the table it wouldn't matter one bit.
I'd like to know what the core devs' plan is given these scenarios, their lack of any statement on this fork is worrying.

Re Tor, it is secure but not 100% secure, see exit nodes.
Re Email updates: I would be surprised, unless he was very careful that a specialist team would not be able to uncover his identity if they knew his email, think of what the NSA / Tailored Access Operations team can do in the name of 'national security'
They found a web server in Iceland all from knowing Snowden's email. 
Like I said, it would not be a good thing but perhaps we are underestimating the capabilities of the state should they really wish to find him..

True, but a lot of that is funded by debt and fractional reserve banking.
Wars cost trillions, some may come from the tax take but the majority comes from a system which allows creation of money from nothing. 
Invest in the bitcoin economy and you can reverse this trend, give a kickback to the government on the way up and the destination is that you arrive at a system where you can't magic up a trillion dollars to start a war and drop bombs on people, 
Sounds like a much better world to me..

Saintkamus: I get the point you're making.
Right now bitcoin is the 90s equivalent of your 56k modem and once the application layer is built with great UX it'll be orders of magnitude better than now..
I guess the point I was making was that if it's to move on from a store of value - easily transmitted to a currency then people will want to buy real things with it.
I can see businesses accepting it once the price grows and volatility gets to an acceptable level and people want to spend them vs hodl.
The fear I have is that if governments ever want to shut it down and stop it being a currency they can massively affect its status by declaring it illegal, only 'fiatcoin' can be used.
It will still function as a store of value and underground transactions will still thrive, but if they forced businesses to no longer accept it, the value would drop pretty fast and it's worth as a store of value even could be wiped out or greatly reduced.
Don't get me wrong, I love bitcoin and invested in 2013 when I saw what they were doing to the Cypriot banks. I want it to succeed  but the above does bear thinking about..

My thoughts are that Rickards is exactly on point.
The reason Lagarde is so interested in bitcoin is that it could be THE global currency they've been dreaming about for years. 
Also shocking in that article is how inflation is used as a weapon against the people.
Start war -&gt; bomb innocent people -&gt; pay for war with debt -&gt; reduce debt exposure by raising interest rates -&gt; screw home population 
It's both eye opening and sickening at the same time.

Part of me thinks that paying the tax is a good thing,  pay for hospitals, schools, nurses, I'm all for anti establishment but if governments are getting a kickback in taxes they'll be less likely to ban it.
The countries that embrace it will see an economic boom as the worlds money flows into their country and they tax it at a reasonable rate..

Glad to hear that money has never owned you. 
The book and article I mentioned will strike a chord if so. The book's guiding message is that happiness "lies not in mindless hedonism but in mindful challenge" and by working on what you are truly passionate about you will experience the state of "flow". 
He compared people from all walks of life, some with great resources, and others literally in prison for life and found that there was no correlation between resources and happiness and people have found a way to create it without vast sums of money.

I am freaking out a little and have realized I need to get a hardware wallet before the fork. Would really help if you could answer these noob questions..
a. Which wallet, nano s or trezor?
b. If I choose either HW wallet it won't make me choose upfront which fork I want to store my bitcoin in, right?
c. If it *does make me choose is there a wallet / option that does not and allows me to wait until some sort of consensus reached?
d. What if I loose the wallet? Not planning on it but are there any best practice such as writing private key on paper and storing in safe deposit box? Steganography?
e. If I order the wallet tomorrow (U.K.) will it arrive prior to the fork?
f. Anything else I should be aware of not to lose coins?

I do hope you follow all of the advice here. It must be an empowering feeling after divorce. I know what it's like to feel like you have no control over life.
Once you've sorted the technical issues and retrieved your coins I would recommend reading a book called 'Flow', and finding something you are incredibly passionate about to keep life meaningful:

Great question, I'm thinking along the same lines as you, cash out along the way when it hits a figure e.g 1 x 25k or 1x 50k depending on what I can stomach..

The way I look at it is this..
I know my cash out point, I know how many I'll keep for 10 years+.
I'll keep investing even with the now lower return rate but not all my life savings as there's up to -70% drop rate but potentially up to 83000x growth rate.
Yes it's a risk but this type of opportunity is once in a lifetime..

@_date: 2017-10-22 20:41:38
Hey, thanks for answering.. 
The thing that freaks me out a tiny bit is the suggestion that as long as there's even a little bit of hashpower going toward the 'losing' chain that technically there is still a chance that the 'winning' chain could be usurped.. am I reading that right?
If so it's kinda dented a little bit of faith in the robustness of what I thought was the consensus i.e a clear winner chosen and once the winner gains consensus we can proceed with confidence.. this seems to be suggesting something else..
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:36:40

He seems to think gold is in limited supply and bitcoin is not ��
Kinda makes me wonder how much he really know about Bitcoin or is he just FUDDIng..
On a more serious note, one question I can't get out of my head and he may have a point on..
It's been said that bitcoin is unkillable, For bitcoin not to be a massive ponzi it has to allow holders to spend it without wild fluctuations.
The government won't be able to break the block chain but they could easily pass laws that forbid any retailer from accepting bitcoin as payment for any good or service..
What happens then? It becomes un-usable, and perhaps that's how it could be "crushed"
Would love to hear the community's  thoughts on this..

Not withstanding the above, even if a consensus is chosen and everything settles down, is there a chance that if you gen buy what you think is BTC from an exchange you still risk getting a shitcoin, there's a chance that can happen right due to technical glitch or a bad actor / nefarious exchange..
Example 1. 
I buy BTC before the next hardfork. Because something happens and the hashpower of all miners switches to bitcoin cash I lose my BTC or BTC becomes erased from history Bitcoin Cash  is now the dominant chain.
Example 2.
I wait two weeks from the 2X fork, people seem to think the legacy chain has 'won' I go to buy more 'bitcoin' and find I'm not getting what I paid for, one of the exchanges has been turned and I actually get a shitty altcoin.
I hope none of this is remotely true and I'm just reading it wrong but would love to get some clarity before I invest any more $$$ into the ecosystem..

What’s with the attitude mate?
I said it would be a multiple of Apple, currently one of the most valuable companies in the world who produce some of the most valued tech in the world (right now).
A couple of points: 
A. it’s not a currency - right now. With lightning it could become one but not right now.
B. What makes you think I’m a traditional investor? I don’t hold any stocks or shares
C. I’m proposing new use cases for what is already incredible tech.
D. I’m capable of fathoming why it’s done so well vs traditional investments. I studied cryptography and my jaw swung open after reading the white paper and realised the potential of this technology very early on
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:59:50
I also think some people are buying it so they never have to cash out to fiat.

I don’t disagree that bitcoin has promise to revolutionise the unbanked of the world, that is a great thing.
Just because it can do that doesn’t mean it couldn’t fix a big malaise in the world, hedge fund money in the stock exchange, insider trading and fraud in any financial market around the world.
I think it can do both! I just happened to focus on stock market as to me if we fix that we could wipe out a lot of manipulation, boom and bust and never have to live through another lost decade due to Lehman’s V2, Libor fraud, CDO’s etc and the misery these events bring..

It’s plausible that the SEC turns a blind eye right now for sure..
I’m not talking about regulation either though..
I’m saying if blockchain / L2 could be used as the basis for trading there is a chance that the malaise of the past ten years could be avoided..
I could be wrong and maybe it’s not possible but I’m sure a better solution could be found..
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:08:10
Yep, agree it would have to be a L2 tech and not directly on bitcoin itself.
When tcp/ip was being written I doubt anyone ever envisaged the current app layer on top..
It will take time to build on the protocol but we have some of the smartest developers in the world working on bitcoin and it’s only getting started, early days for sure, I can’t wait to see what the future brings..
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:52:54
Agree with your basic point here, don’t need to go for hard and fast ATH + 20% but more to the point of if we know it tends to drop 70% - 80 % some time after the ATH, get out and get back in to maximise your holdings..?
