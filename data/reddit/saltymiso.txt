"Kraken, a global bitcoin exchange headquartered in San Francisco, says it will acquire both Cavirtex and Coinsetter for an undisclosed amount, and will consolidate the two exchanges under its own brand. Client accounts will be transferred to the new platform on Jan. 26."

thats an aggressive assertion. who are you to determine what is or is not a legitimate use of the ledger? theyre paying the same fees to get added to a block as anyone else
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:33:25
"Interestingly, it calls into question whether the recent price drop in bitcoin was attributable solely to the departure of a long-time influencer, or perhaps also somewhat compounded by broader macro market events that drove gold up ~5%, off of 6-year lows, in the days preceding that announcement."
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:10:21
agreed. correlation of 0.72 over that much data is pretty serious though. this quote from the analysis sums it up well: "Worth also noting that certain micro shocks (i.e. the dramatic Yuan devaluation in August) did not immediately correspond with higher bitcoin prices, but the longer term trend and provable mathematical correlation indicate that the relationship is worth keeping an eye on."
@_date: 2016-01-28 22:48:03
not sure what you mean, but you should probably ask whoever wrote it
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:31:36
actually seems like pretty big news. would imagine this is what silbert was referring to here: 
@_date: 2016-12-27 14:58:45
* [Genesis Trading]( - Part of Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group. They are probably the largest in the space and will make a market on any size volume
* [Cumberland Mining]( - Part of DRW, an extremely successful and well-known prop shop in Chicago. Also will make a market for just about any volume.
- [itBit OTC]( - Run by the same people as the exchange. Longstanding business. Seems like they probably do good volume.
- [Bitfinex OTC]( - Run by the same people as the exchange. New, unclear how serious it is. 
Edit: formatting
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:30:35
Is there a time limit / max block height by which that threshold has to be reached? If not, seems as though it's the likely eventuality 
@_date: 2015-07-01 08:36:17
surprising they could do that kind of volume with 60k when coinbase has millions of wallets and does half as much. anyone know why that is?
@_date: 2017-04-25 11:28:03
yes and all the large bitcoin trading shops apparently already use it from what I've seen
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:00:39
super helpful thanks for your wit and insight
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:24:02
how much otc trading is there compared to exchange volume?
@_date: 2016-10-24 00:29:29
So sell it for cash, get approved for the loan, and buy back afterwards. Seems pretty easy

@_date: 2013-08-26 23:42:37

been following asicminer for a while. i think it has to do with the variability of hardware performance. if you look at asicminercharts.com you can see how much it swings from day to day. 
i think 60 is a target that they sort of bounce above and below. anyone feel free to correct me though. friedcat doesn't alwasy explain well

this documents contain the normal money laundering concerns, etc., but seems far from approaching it with a level, investigative viewpoint as generally has been the case. 
the tipping point for me was the use of 'ersatz' to describe digital currency. the investigation is biased before it even begins

perhaps i'm missing something? what do you mean by holding a private key in this case? unless they have the private key of the buyer or seller, they can only authorize a transaction between two other parties. they'd never have access to the actual bitcoin

Bart Chilton is out to sell books, as advertised at the end of the panel. His book is about Ponzis and he even said that he can't say bitcoin is a ponzi.
Bitcoin is hot right now so he's exploiting it. Simple as that.

yeaaa.... this looks like exactly the kind of scams he pointed out in the article
@_date: 2013-09-19 18:19:04
To an extent, but there has to be a cap on the effect at some point. Presumably if more and more people are doing this, the return from this kind of work would be reduced, reducing the incentives to participate and sending talent elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-08-05 11:24:53
did you read the article? the first section is about a completely different asic company headed by a head guy from samsung
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:18:38
Am I to understand that transactions are where the actual bitcoins are stored, and wallets are just access passes to be able to draw from those transactions?

can you explain further
@_date: 2013-08-05 13:13:28
Looks like that may be the case. tgb just updated their piece with:


its highly unlikely the wsj would run a piece without properly sourcing. i'd guess someone with at least some degree of credibility intentionally misled people on this
@_date: 2013-07-24 16:10:30
to your credit, you do seem to be omnipresent. no one can take that much away from you
@_date: 2013-09-10 15:24:23
its easy to say that looking back, but trying to organize the global supply chain for the first ever application specific bitcoin mining hardware is a tall order, especially for someone young without industry connections. from what i gather, he seems legitimately concerned with distribution of network power and has worked towards that.
also says a lot that his second generation of chips will be sold from stock only. lots of other companies have moved on to second generation hardware still using preorders.
there are definitely more ideal outcomes to this story, but i don't think i could have odne any better
@_date: 2013-10-17 18:58:31
literally a rocket going to (presumably) the moon.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:05:17
they could be. you should see the original versions of asicminers financials. tgb made them about 10x more consumable. could all be total bs though, probably why they start the report with that disclaimer.
friedcat (the ceo) has been pretty dependable though, and made a lot of people very rich already.

not a finance guy so you should double check this, but if i'm understanding the article correctly basically if the fed slows down or stops its current policies it is good for the dollar because the policies are inflationary. bitcoin is a sort of an anti-gov currency, so it should (and apparently has been) move against the dollar if people are worried about inflation. bernanke's testimony will shed light on what hte fed is going to do.

I like the idea of two factor ID, but i don't know a single party i'd trust to store it outside of myself.

they got some big VC investment, going to be a long time before they're public

So tired of these. the cassacius coins got manipulated at DEFCON. it's just people trying to cash in on suckers while the market's hot. 
@_date: 2013-07-29 19:12:16
One of them is an unconfirmed transaction. Probably f'd up whatever script they have running payouts but it happens all the time. Don't think it's worth wrorrying too much about.
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:12:57
was posted on tgb over the weekend but i didn't see it / post here until today. looking at the prices on gox and bitstamp though looks like its still only about 5% different
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:06:54
That statement annoyed me. There's a bunch of speculation about how the financial world works with absolutely zero supporting statements. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 23:22:07
i don't know why anyone is downvoting you. that was awesome.
@_date: 2013-10-08 13:26:47


anyone else notice that? it's almost as though he realizes people don't think drugs are that bad and has to reassure people that what he's doing is worth their tax money.
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:58:36
what if you lose it with bad trades?

This time. you're not always on point. but no one is i suppose.

well nice job being on it. who the hell are these jokers

Sounds like it's just hard drive recovery. Good luck proving and enforcing anything around actual stolen bitcoin

Whatt? 0.8.5 was an emergency update to fix a critical bug that made nodes unable to connect
@_date: 2013-08-06 15:28:47
Interesting theory, but 99.9% seems a bit high when considering the level of speculation involved ;)
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:47:08
let the market decide, not mods
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:52:08
Ha, twice now I've agreed with you. i'm starting to get worried.
@_date: 2013-09-09 15:16:43
Why would it be control of the money if the coins are never in a position to hit the company's account? third parties in m-of-n transactions only add a signature to authorize a specificied transaction, not act as a repository for funds. this would be different if the company ever had access to the buyer or seller's private keys, but that's not the way the BIP works
@_date: 2013-09-09 15:47:33
awesome. thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:28:08
yes, let's upvote your post so you can exploit a tragedy to promote your company. There's about 10 other places to donate bitcoin already.

@_date: 2013-11-26 18:32:13
the way this question is asked is disconcerting at best. if you can't come up with good reasons, then your parents are doing a good job with whatever information they have.
instead of asking a question with a pre-determined answer, you should be looking to seek the truth honestly for your own benefit.

whichever exchange just trades to all of them from one account is going to win. if they can actually pull this off that's huge

At least he's still happy. That's what really matters.

Didn't CoinX just manage to partner with three banks? Sounds like this trend is changing for the better.
@_date: 2013-09-20 15:49:48
Depends how you project netowrk growth. At 50% monthly growth instead of 80 like we've been seeing, plenty of them become reasonable investments.
@_date: 2013-04-27 18:37:10
Where are the mods on this?
@_date: 2013-08-05 13:38:15
looks like it's CNBC vs the WSJ. curious to see how this plays out. looks like tgb added this update also


@_date: 2013-10-09 20:05:22
ha now just 30 some-odd pages to go! i was thinking around the same in terms of price, though i'd probably set it higher also if i worked on it myself
@_date: 2013-07-24 21:17:34
thank you. was looking at the last chart in the post that shows gox still 3x as much as bitstamp trying to figure out what the heck was going on.
i dislike gox as much as the next guy, but this is a pretty sensationalist headline. probably sent to CD from bitstamp along with that puffy quote. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 15:51:07
That's ridiculous. You're spamming an important subreddit with advertisements for your company. The number of people there is irrelevant.

there's different/additional info in the journal piece. seems more likely the journal and examiner had the same incorrect source.

i know who he is. sometimes he even makes sense, though it's probably by chance given that his view is always negative. i'd like to believe there's good in everyone.

solid piece. was curious how 9/11 was going to tie in here, glad i read through
@_date: 2013-07-16 16:09:10
I dont think its meant to be a definitive measurement. It's a clear trend / trend changes. That's what matters.

is there no community checking process for this stuff? they just push out what they want? would like to see a community code review before just releasing into the wild. they're good, but there's a lot that goes into software dev. maybe im just not aware of something going on behind the scenes?
@_date: 2013-09-13 01:39:58
OP who posted the alert on LB forum just posted the text below. can someone explain what's going on?






@_date: 2013-11-09 18:26:47


thought that was pretty interesting
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:57:54
ha yea a lot made good money on the way up also
@_date: 2013-08-06 17:11:41
They address that possibility towards the end. Basically says that if the site doesn't get developed more through some sort of growth attempt after the acquisition, then it would be a possible sign of that being the case
