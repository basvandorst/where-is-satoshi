Relatively slow in comparison to other crypto. Confirmations take up to an hour for me. Transaction fee is 0.001 btc which even now is 6 bucks. Not arrogance, just personal experience.

Well, wading through the publicity bs is part of the sphere. Some may actually end up being that way. Why support a currency that is slow and expensive to use? Btc may be the most recognized start to digital currency, but that position as king, I'd put my money on that it will fall, eventually.

If we could avoid selling FIAT for crypto, I'd be all for it, but that's just not the case. Even if you were an employer, aside from the case of you being an exchange or a miner, you would still need to source BTC, again, at an exchange. The game is so heavily skewed towards the miners, and with such a large barrier to market entry (hardware costs), I don't see an alternative with the current system.

Let's say I want to pay for goods or services abroad, perhaps to avoid international wire fees or exchange commissions, but I don't have btc. I would have to obtain the btc first, and unless I'm willing to find someone on localbitcoins, exchanges are the place to go.

Yeah but how many confirmations before a transaction is considered legit? Not just one. Trading on an exchange, where the lightning network is not in use, is this not the case?

How old though? I can see the sarcasm but we're still early stage here. A lot of great other options put btc in its place. Considering cost to use and cost to mine, features, this should be an obvious flag.

Not true. The inherent inefficiency of its method of mining must lead to its demise.

Haha, weird. I just got back from Japan. Don't worry though, Kraken should be up there within the year, or so I'm told.

I met Jesse while I was tending bar this year in Tokyo. Seems like a nice guy who wants to get it done the right way, and I could taste his contempt for Gox's practices. I use the service now and their customer support is damn quick/good. I would definitely recommend the service. God knows it could use more volume.

Maybe one reason would be that they are borrowing money at a 2% rate and lending it to you at 28%? That such banks, not Chase specifically, more JP Morgan, are indicted in manipulating commodities markets through the CME Futures market for a decade? Global financial crisis by repackaging shit, having their accomplices slap a AAA rating on it, eventually nearly bringing the financial system to a halt? Maybe someone else wants to chime in here.

Being able to institute a change to the protocol without having to do a hard fork would be mighty useful 'bout now... &gt;&gt;&gt; Cardano.

Sure, what kind I do for you?

My experience went like this:
Woohoo! Free trades!
Yey! I made a few bucks!
Let's try that again!
O god it plummeted.

Before that, Steam games.  Most of the services purchasable with bitcoins are pretty computer based anyways (servers, hosting), it would be such an easy stretch.  
@_date: 2013-04-02 03:07:21
Someone please hit up steam games.

Pretty awesome gain there.  By any chance are you working with a bot you made in python?
