k, yea it can be confusing.  Coinbase gets a lot of crap about fees but the reason their fees are higher is because of that high risk insurance premium they're paying Lloyd's.  Of course, it doesn't help someone from their own stupidity in the case that they don't secure their account properly.

there are certainly other ideas for what creates a new coin.  I've always liked the idea of using actual real world calculations, thinking like CFD, Medical or even SETI as an application.  Something that has real world value rather than calculating difficult math problems just for the sake of it being complicated.

If there is any doubt, get off bitfenix, at the end of the day though, tether is worth around $600m in total market cap, that is less than 3% of the total market cap of all cryptos.  There would be a small dip in all cryptos, people would buy the dip and things would move on.

Of course, they're a business.  They add their own cut on top of networks transaction fees.  Most exchanges an mining pools payouts do the same thing.  I haven't used Coinbase but check your transaction, it is probably part of them sending out a bunch of other transactions at the same time.

I don't mind Roger but he doesn't understand the bitcoin code technically.  He goes on and on about blocksize, bcash has chosen what I believe is 8 MB blocksize vs 1 MB blocksize, if their goal is to take on the likes of VISA and process 30,000 transactions per second they will need more than 8 MB too.  They will need lightning network, off  chain or equivalent just like Bitcoin itself does. B

It's a different scenario than Mt. Gox but as I already said, I agree there would be a dip in all cryptos because if people used tether to buy btc, they then would use that btc to buy other cryptos too.  I just believe that bitcoin is resilient enough at this point to bounce off any bad news.  The community is also wiser than they were with Mt. Gox.

Sure.  Anyway, the above poster could have purchased directly with Coinbase.  If you buy BTC directly from Coinbase, you lock in the price at the time of purchase, of course with fees.  He instead is trying to avoid fees and is going to miss out on $1-2k per coin if he had done it through coinbase.
