Most people don't even know what they are talking about when they say 51% attack. This has and will always be an issue because this is a free market environment. If not ghash then btcguild, a long time ago it was deepbit. 
The reality is if anyone ever did a 51% attack they would be attacking them self's unless it was a junk alt coin  they planned on destroying. If you attack and rinse out btc you destroy the only good way to convert digital currency into real world money. Cut off your nose to spite your face.

gox is closed and i lost the last 1.38 bitcoin i had left after getting scammed by terrahash trying to buy mining asics last year. tldr it is better to steal everyone's bitcoins because apparently that's not illegal
@_date: 2014-03-01 07:25:49
yea i had money in gox from some of the first coins i mined in 2011. not a lot but it was from a long time ago. i would trade them back and forth here and there. it was the ONLY place when i first started to trade btc...let alone the biggest and oldest. all these people saying "TOLD YOU SO TOLD YOU SO" are really missing the point is here. The largest and oldest bitcoin exchange just turned off and hundreds of millions of dollars and countless peoples time and effort got stolen. anyone who says "good riddance" to gox dying like needs to stop and see the damage its causing to public image. its bad when one of the corner stones of your supposed online community shits the bed. i've been a member of this sub since it had 5000 members, i rode every wave, seen the panic, smelled the fear and watched hopes get CRUSHED when people sold the farm to buy btc. 
i stopped listening to people in this sub because most of them know less than half of what they think they thought they did last week.
i don't feel bad for losing btc in gox. i feel bad for the others, i knew what i was doing was a gamble and i lost. it happens, but then again i love to gamble. but the people who weren't trying to gamble, who investing their savings and life into...only to have it stolen. that is wrong and someone should pay for that

i just bought a six pack of beer from philadelphia brewing company this afternoon with btc, there was a meetup of the philly bitcoin group there today. tonight there was a event you could pay with btc to get in. its growing and i think you are a great spokesperson for bitcoin.

Firstly the NSA or especially China would DDOS not ask nicely with a bribe or blackmail. Many of the large pools get DDOS attacks all the time anyway. Secondly miners are constantly trying to improve their ROI so they WILL go to where the lowest fees are, or to the larger pools with higher luck because it means faster payouts. Thirdly and I will say it again most people don't even know how to pull off a 51% attack technically. Or if you will, people talk about a 51% as if anyone with that much computing power would ruin the exact thing they were trying to obtain buy compromising the entire validity of the network in order to get a few extra blocks.
If I had a btc for every time someone made a 51% post I would have thousands, yet for all the worried talk there has never been a significant "attack"
@_date: 2014-07-16 19:02:05
you can do a 51% attack with 45% it just isn't as successful. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:42:57
if someone pulled off an attack @ 40% then it would have the same results as a 51% attack
@_date: 2014-02-20 03:34:37
somebody call the fire deparment because that is a sick burn!
@_date: 2014-07-17 02:22:43
most people don't even know the mechanics behind an attack, they just hear that it is bad and they should grab the pitchforks. since the network was 6TH/S i have been hearing about the 51% attack. the reality is unless is was done for lolz pulling a 51% double spend would only crash the value of the thing you were trying to get. so you would single handedly get a bunch of btc and in turn make them worthless at the same time.
now if someone hacked a giant pool and wanted to ruin btc that is the real danger of having the majority of hashing power.

no one gets a free ride. i expect if they proceed with this class action suit that the people who lost their shirts will be shit all over by people in this subreddit. just like every other "i told you so" situation that happens all to often with bitcoin related products and services. and in the end if anything is recovered they attorney fees will negate anything actually recovered.

I can appreciate things like tor, taking steps to ensure anonymity. but they would need to have tor and https set properly, no plugins etc. anyone who would go to the trouble to set something like this up i would assume would do the homework and ensure everything they possibly could do to hide tracks. and for their sake lets hope they did.

oh thats not to bad then. i haven't been keeping up with the pre order times.
@_date: 2012-08-16 04:56:56
Not to long ago the trade volume went up, and so did the price. As soon as the volume dropped back down again, so did the price. If this spike in volume is just speculation and not real world services then when who ever is creating this volume cashes out, the price will reflect that. The real value in bitcoins will come from sustainable scalable infrastructure, not fake trade volume. 
@_date: 2012-02-17 06:12:13
Sustainable scaleable infrastructure. Just like any buisness 
@_date: 2012-09-06 17:55:49
Justify it however you want man, it is still punishable in court in this country. Right or wrong in the eyes of a libertarian mean fuck all to judge.

Yes I agree. I guess time will tell.
@_date: 2012-08-20 05:09:42
people bought in heavy when they were at $20 a pop as well. when we see sustainable scalable infrastructure the real value will emerge and i have a feeling it's going to be pretty crazy ride to get there.

i have mined .4 btc so far, however im switching cards to a 5770 today. once i have enough to pay back the cost of the new card i will sell then start holding for a little while again.
@_date: 2011-10-17 16:53:38
I wouldn't be surprised if it hit .05. Not trying to rain on parades but just my opinion.

People all commenting in the same hour about how awesome it is! I'm excited going to download this when I get home and install it on everyones computer...if they like it or not! Then I'm going to uninstall all my antivirus programs, disable my firewall, only use Internet explorer, and change all my passwords to the same thing. I mean it's not like any major websites in the bitcion community have been compromised in recent weeks. It's not like bitcoin is called the "Hacker Curency" or anything...the sad thing is, people will download this and lose there wallets.

I am the same way, just picked up a 5770 on friday and should have my first full coin by tomorrow. Now the trick is selling my old 9800GT card. I put my computer in front of my air conditioner and it does a pretty good job of keeping it at 63c.

My feelings are bitcoin needs sustainable infostructure. In order to be a currency and not a exchange for other currency's. I wouldn't be surprised if it dropped to $10 again. If it did it would still be more valuable then it was even 3 months ago. There will be growing pains and those that jump on the bandwagon to turn a quick few bucks might be in for a shock. 
@_date: 2011-06-22 20:25:50

I am looking back the the info posted on the 14th at pastebin. It does not matter so much as who as it matters that people now see this "bitcoin" thing as more than a game. This is real money, these are real people behind these faceless coins. And currently the people who lost money because of this breach are fucking pissed. The pretty happy gold rush is dead as the Kennedys. This is only the beginning of bitcoins and we should be on the cutting edge of security, no question about that. Instead everyone is waiting for MagicTheGatheringonlineXchange to get there playing cards...errr thousands of dollars back.
@_date: 2011-06-17 22:36:56
My thoughts are, people want safe easy to use bitcoins. When that happens you will see your $25 coins again. Sustainable scaleable secure infostructure, build that... and you will build the value of your coins.

when i first started freaking out about btc it was $7 a piece. people still think don't fucking get it. they will when it's to late. also this sub had less than 5k people. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:32:44
i watched in real time it go from $3-$33 and lost my mind over it. i guessed it would hit $500 about two weeks ago. i cannot honestly say where it will land now. very exciting but this isn't my first bitcoin rodeo. i only offer it as a word of caution to those on their first price ride
@_date: 2013-02-17 23:47:31
it could also be worth $7. dont get me wrong $50 would be great but these things take time. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:35:53
where you hear when gox got hacked? this is nothing new, in fact MAGIC THE GATHERING ONLINE EXCHANGE is doing pretty well all things considered. if you are leaving its understandable, but uh yea since you don't need bitcoins anymore can i have yours? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:27:09
my guess is $1500 is the tipping point. but hell it could be $2500-$5000
