For the last two years I have done a talk entitled “Why Bitcoin Has Value.” I was amazed that I could buy the domain name. What I found from doing the talk is that when I talked about the dark web or tax avoidance people started turning off. From this I tried to make the web site rated PG. Like F I was trying to make the talk interesting!!!
Anyway a few drinks have kicked in and I hope the web site does develop into something more. From the feedback I have made a lot of improvements IMO. I am grateful for this. However, for the people downvoting me can you please let me know why? I understand that I am not being original and I am not trying to be. I am trying to help people new to Bitcoin. 
Like I could do a video or blog on 
Buying weed in Canada with Bitcoin. 
Spending Bitcoin with the backpackers in Agnes Water. 
Tipping a stripper in Vegas with a QR code on their body in Bitcoin. 
Buying drugs on the dark web and getting it mailed to my Grandmother in her old age home. Sorry Gran but I think this would be funny. I might even ring the police. 
Interviewing members of the PLA/IRA etc and asking them if they take Bitcoin as a donation.  
Interviewing members of gangs and asking them if they have heard of Bitcoin. 
Opening up a Swiss bank account in Bitcoin. 
Going on an international flight and using the Bitcoin ATM’s in both countries. 
I could investigate the Bitcoin situation in San Juan. 
I could shop in Brisbane airport using BTC. 
I could investigate Bitcoin and Seasteading. 
The list could go on. To me this is entertainment. I guess it would be a more adult show/blog of the Bitcoin Family. Didi seems like a cool guy to me. 
Your feedback would be appreciated.

Hope you don't mind that I quoted from you. I really loved what you wrote. (Maybe I can relate to it LOL) 
Will add IMMUTABILITY and DECENTRALIZATION. 
I am not that smart so will need some time and I want it to relate to how it "gives bitcoin value".
@_date: 2019-07-07 06:31:02
I am interested in others people opinion on this. I admit that I think this gives Bitcoin value. However I am trying to keep things short, concise and easy to understand. I have added it to the bottom of the page with appropriate credits. However it might get deleted.

Ok I put scarcity at the top. Thanks for that. 
I think I explained scarcity and utility early on.
Will have a look as to where and how I put "saleability".
@_date: 2019-07-07 08:11:25
I have added in  IMMUTABILITY and DECENTRALIZATION. Thanks. If you could have a read and make any suggestions it would be appreciated. 
You really made my day. Were you surprised to read your "I'm swinging for the fences" quote on the page? 
I have had a great afternoon making improvements IMO to the page. I am very grateful to the Bitcoin community for the help so far.

I barely know what javascript is. Having ten sounds stupid for a very basic website. 
I wrote my first website about twenty years ago using Microsoft Front-page. [anthonywhite.net](   (I was not smart enough to write in HTML like a couple of my friends could at the time.) 
This is my first go at using Wix since Front Page no longer works. I tried to make the web site simple and information/content driven. 
Will have a look at Wix to sort this out. Maybe I need to employ a Wix expert. For a small website not sure if this is a big deal. More info would be appreciated. Thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2019-07-09 07:04:19
Try reading  this might help.
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:36:18
Thanks. Will fix all of these up. 
However I am an Australian and we do say "carton of Beer". LOL Will change it anyway. 
"Bitcoin is not stored on a computer, etc, etc.. Keys are. Not bitcoins." I understand this. Will try and reword it.
@_date: 2019-07-15 23:57:39
I finished this web site about two weeks ago. 
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:49:44
@_date: 2019-07-03 10:34:41
Good point. If Bitcoin is useful then people will use it.
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:58:39
Changed a few things around at the top. 
@_date: 2019-07-07 09:23:20
Thanks. I am old fashion !!! When I am not spending (and replacing) Bitcoin I am actually using real cash. 
I wrote my first website about twenty years ago using Microsoft Front-page. [anthonywhite.net]( 
This is my first go at using Wix since Front Page no longer works. 
In my defence LOL I am trying to make the web site appeal to my parents and old fart friends. 
The Bitcoin Community makes me feel young again. Feels like the .com era all over again LOL. 
Thanks for the feedback.

In the last seven hours the page has gotten bigger. 
A table of contents might be added or I might try learning how to do hyperlinks and send more detailed information to other pages. 
I am trying to keep things short and concise and still be informative....... 
Thanks for the feedback.

Hi Mark\_Bear,
I like what you have written and I have posted this up on [ unedited and giving you the credit for writing it. Let me know if you want it taken down or modified.

Dear Bitcoin Family 
Are you forgetting that  [ will be open for business very soon. 
This company is some sort of subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange, Microsoft and a few other powerful USA companies. 
As far as I am concerned they have done my USA due diligence for me. 
Let's welcome them into the family by testing out their products and services and see what they have to offer. 
I have watched the movie "Wall Street" about one hundred times, I have also worked as a stockbroker for several years. My gut feeling is that Wall Street will love the Bitcoin culture and will add something to it. (They will take Lambo, hookers and blow to the next level.) 
Personally I would like to see Bitcoin become more established in Africa and South America before Wall Street. However let's make everyone welcome including the USA Congress.

Thanks for reading to the end! I have fixed this up. 
I am not very good at spelling, proof reading or grammar. The help so far has been great. 
You are right in that over time I will learn a lot more about the topic. I expect that Bitcoin uses will expand over time as well and I am looking forward to that and making updates.
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:42:11
You could add my favourite link. 
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:56:20
Agree. 
(I wonder how he made the prediction. My guess in Gann? Square of nine or some sort of astrology and a lot of good luck.)
@_date: 2019-02-23 08:11:32
When someone is shorting Bitcoin they have a lot of incentive to put shit on Bitcoin. 
Just like when you buy Bitcoin you have a lot of incentive to tell other people to buy Bitcoin and to tell people how good Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2019-02-23 08:06:25
Impressive. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:34:13
This way Mobil can buy their fuel from Iran in Bitcoin and avoid US trade sanctions. (Not using the SWIFT or any banking system.) 
At a guess Iranian oil is probably selling below the spot price. 
Selling Bitcoin in Iran seems to get a premium price. 
Very clever.
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:35:17
I like the plot twist. It is only a matter of time.
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:35:32


This is actually a very funny comment.
@_date: 2019-04-13 09:14:02
I am not a fan of any of the BTC forks and I do think many are a distraction.  However......
I do get the impression that the forks can be a good place to properly test out some new technology before being added to BTC. Anyone have further thoughts on this?

I'm an Australian and out Government and banks are better than most in the world. Far from perfect but not the worst. I am not always proud of my Government or the Australian banks. 
I don't like this "Nationalism" in the headline and I generally believe in "free speech". 
I have a love for the Bitcoin community all around the world. I see that we are one community. Please let's not get divided by bullshit lines on a map. Let's not get divided by bullshit governments that want to break us up. 
In an ideal world I really want to see Bitcoin for everyone who wants it. I think the Bitcoin community should help out the countries that are trying to ban it. Help out the people who are having troubles obtaining a bit of Bitcoin. 
I really hate it that some people can not have bank accounts, Give them bitcoin. 
I really hate it that some women are not allowed to own anything. Give them bitcoin. 
Spread the love. We are one community.

About a month ago I dreamt that Bitcoin moved up from $20 000 to $100 000 quite rapidly. It then settled at $100 000 for a while and then very slowly moved up to $200 000. At $200 000 the world seemed like a very friendly place and I started dreaming about something else. 
I was sort of wondering if anyone else had similar dreams or if I should go to a dream interpreter.
