Antana coin has no value in bitcoin terms. If the person who sold it to you said it did, then you've been scammed. 
The only data on the coin is that of data from the time it was printed. 
If you want bitcoin for it you have to sell it. It's not like a giftcard for bitcoin it's just a novelty item.

Sure I agree with that. But, many big hedge funds on Wall St. and the like invested in Futures because they are regulated and less risky. The fact is that investors lost a considerable amount so I doubt we will see an 'explosion'

Why would they spend it on bitcoin when they just lost a load of money on futures contracts?

In terms of commodities they are much less riskier because you can guarantee a price to buy and/or sell at a specific time. So if there were a supply shock you'd be protected (for farmers and such). 
Also, if you look at the XBT/F8 contract on cboe the loses are less than if investors were to have bought bitcoin

Exactly! The rich should get poorer with ridiculously high transaction fees!
