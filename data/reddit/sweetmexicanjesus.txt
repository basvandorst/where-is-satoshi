I could also have made the argument along the lines of "arousing curosity" being the best way to introduce someone to a topic, or even to sell a product. 
There's obviously a huge degree to which the Bitcoin community absolutely should invest its efforts in education, but there's also room for leaving some mystery/mystique to intrigue people.

The Knights Templar had ways around this problem, as have many other societies. Could be we just sort-of stockpile various commodities on various worlds, and only have to "ship" the commodities needed on various other worlds, the remainder of transactions being settled from within each world's own resource/finance pool.

Doesn't matter, lol, it made your whiskers twitch, and instead of saying "hmm, maybe I'll just avoid this", you paid money to test it out!
Again, I ain't criticizing, *per se*, I do stuff like that all the time. In my case, it's with things like "new" incoming spam mails that are clearly viruses. I pull it into my "lab" vm and see what they've sent me, then roll back to a snapshot afterward.
Now, if you're protesting because you think you deserve some "for science" brownie points, well, I ain't gonna disagree with that, for the same reasons/thinking already stated.

Exactly. There's layers of historical/cultural meaning behind the notions of "Oneness" being invoked here, and not all of them are good, like it or not, better or worse.
Edit: Hey, don't shoot the messenger. I *wish* we could all get on-board as one species without *any* dystopian baggage involved, whether perceived, imagined, or actual. If we could do that, we could talk about Bitcoin being the currency *of the stars*, and not merely Planet Earth.

You didn't answer my question, which I find interesting. Just a speculation on my part, but your attitude, go-to phrases and writing style, and most of all, your casual-but-still-sarcasm-drenched disdain are strongly reminiscent of somebody I sort-of follow who is very distinctive in how he carries himself on all those fronts. (Hell, even your username, actually.)
Wasn't meaning to troll, either, though I am backhandedly amused at just how effectively I did so without even trying. Definitely a small lesson learned here for those occasions where trolling is actually my full and unapologetic intent, which doesn't happen often, but hey, I'm human.
I'll let it go at this. If my rhetorical radar is right....well, first, I'm kinda surprised to see you slumming here. But second, we're definitely not going to agree past a point already passed, so why bother?
PS: If I am right, I enjoyed your latest post.
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:53:11
LOL, OK man, I can appreciate that. A lot of times I just reply from within my inbox/comments dialog, and forget to check and see if my erstwhile correspondent is getting smothered with orangereds.
And yeah, a lot of times you have to remember that the internet is chock full of people who need conflict, are ludicrously narrow-minded, have actual mental problems, etc. Or that just want to argue/debate, which is something I'm guilty of sometimes. 
Plus the obvious fanboy element in this sub, which often perceives even the slightest subtext of criticism as a personal assault.
Seems like you've got your sense of humor back, and I'll let you be from here. Cheers!

1000X this. To be clear, I just follow this community, and don't have assets to invest or risk right now. I've opened accounts with some BTC sites, but haven't actually bought any at this time. Just so you know where I'm at in offering these impressions:
The *&lt;ahem&gt; overenthusiasm* scares me even as somebody who is very interested in the concept, because I'm still aloof enough to be a relative outsider and be able to look at things in that light.
People are getting to be pretty wary of touts at this point. (I would hope, anyway.) Consider that your average middle-aged family have seen their investments, income, and savings diminished by, in order, inflation (expansionary monetary supply), Dot-Com Bubble I, Globalization &amp; Offshoring, more inflation (skyrocketing health-care costs), the Housing Bubble, more inflation (rising food costs), Dot-Com Bubble II, The Great Recession, and finally, what's shaping up to be Dot-Com Bubble III.
Many of them have also fallen prey to various kinds of online scams, including but not limited to: phishing, "ransomware", and compromises of their financial information.
I work as a solo developer/consultant. And I've noticed lately: not only are there a lot more shady people trying to break into my industry, but also a lot more shops/agencies getting really shady themselves. 
The net effect is that when telling people what I do, or pitching my services, I'm getting a *major* hairy eyeball, and really having to work far harder than in the past to overcome that and close the sale or land the project. People are getting really skeptical, and that's because they've been repeatedly burned by these "things they don't fully understand".
And I think that's starting to apply to *a lot* of things that have a digital/internet/online angle to them.
The "way forward" on Bitcoin adoption is just to let it fill the role it was designed to fill and take an active, but more passive role in promoting it -- that is to say: "by example", or "by request", rather than "by force". 
People didn't take long to figure out how credit cards worked, did they? Some advocacy is OK, but I think it's really important to not be over-the-top about it.

I'd love to hear your argument and timeframe for this occurring*. It sounds....utterly ridiculous. But so too did BTC = $1K, and here we are.
\* So long as that argument isn't predicated on "apocalyptic collapse of the USD", that is. Nobody's going to let that happen, at least not anywhere close to that extent for the simple reason that, aside from the Ron Paul crowd, nobody seriously thinks it'd be a desirable thing to *allow* to happen.
PS: I actually came into this thread thinking it'd be fanboys excoriating the guy for not announcing "BTC on PP on the PDQ". Was pleasantly surprised to see people realizing that this was a Big Thing for alt-currencies, and that even his personal endorsement is hugely valuable, even if he's withholding his professional endorsement for the time being.
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:30:29
Pretty sure I've been bending over backward to assure you that agreement/disagreement isn't even a factor here.
And y'know, while I replied to your comment, the rest of the thread makes pretty clear that you weren't the only one that "tested it out", so my little point of amusement stands.
Not a big deal, nor much to get worked up about, except when you look at it in the aggregate on the scammer's side of things.

Yeah, but it's not like we'll be skipping straight to Alpha Centauri, either. They've already tested the fundamental basis of theoretical interplanetary networking. Baby steps, man, baby steps. 
I presume by the time we've worked out lightspeed or FTL travel, we'll also have worked out how to communicate, but it could also take a little while longer: we sailed the seas for centuries and engaged in commerce worldwide without being able to communicate in real-time. Who's to say we wouldn't adjust the protocols of virtual currencies to account for this, instead?
