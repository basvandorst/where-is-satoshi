To be clear, I'm not a huge fan of Le Pen or the Front National. The party is definitely anti-Bitcoin. On the other hand, if I were French, I would vote for her. A vote for anyone except her is a vote to exterminate the Jews that remain in France and a vote to have the next generation of French natives live under ancient barbaric laws.

This seems wildly premature. It's less than a week since she was assaulted by fascists (who are so ignorant they believe they're antifascists).
Has Sandra Fluke shut the fuck up yet? No one even actually attacked her.

France is already in a horrible war. The only question is how long the majority of voters will continue to deny it.

A good introduction to the war is this article from The Atlantic:
It details a number of attacks within France, especially targetting French Jews. The article was written in early 2015, after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, and the corresponding attack on a Jewish supermarket. Since then there have been numerous attacks, most notably the wave in November 2015 (including the massive attack at the Bataclan), the "Truck of Peace" attack in Nice on Bastille Day 2016, and the recent attack at the Louvre.
I have made no explicit mention of the attackers. We are still living in a time when naming the attackers is considered ignorant, racist and hateful. But people know. And the fact that they're forced to pretend not to know makes it all the more likely that someone like Le Pen could win by the vote of a silent majority.
It's probably to late for France. France has probably already surrendered. If it isn't too late, this election is probably the last chance to do something about it.

This comment is inconsistent with the one you made right before it (elsewhere on this thread):


I'm sorry to say, but this makes me very suspicious of your motives. If you're genuinely someone new to Bitcoin and learning about things, then my advice is to focus on the technology and leave the Satoshi speculation alone. If you're pretending to be new to Bitcoin and have bad motives, well, I hope you fail at whatever you're trying to do.

I suspect most of the pushback comes from your side insisting on what other people should *say* and even what they should *think*.
It is literally now considered bigotry to *think* Caitlyn Jenner is not actually a woman.
There's a 2+2=5 aspect to that.
I'm not too concerned about it personally. I suspect the pendulum will swing the other way at some point, and hopefully the people who pushed ridiculous notions will be about as welcome in society as the klan is now.
If someone is interested in the thoughts of a transsexual who seems quite reasonable and intelligent, look up Blaire White.

No. Reasonable people can disagree about the role of genetics vs. environment. It has nothing to do with bigotry.


"Morally wrong"? Only if they're forced on someone against their will. Just like it's morally wrong to force someone to bake a pizza for a gay wedding. I take a libertarian point of view on such things. In other words, I'm a terrible person who doesn't want to force people to do what's-currently-considered-morally-right-by-those-who-control-the-culture-at-the-moment.


Being a "human being" is nothing to be proud of. Every terrible atrocity throughout history was committed by a "human being." Considering yourself a "human being" is reason enough to consider suicide.


It's fine with me if they transition.


The issue is simple: I decide how many genders I believe there are, and I decide which of those genders I believe the other person belongs to. I'm not handing over my own judgment to some collective's strange beliefs of the moment.


No, I'm not. Are you hurt or damaged if I refer to Caitlyn Jenner as a man named Bruce? If so, why do you think that is.


It's more that I'm committed to thinking for myself, but that's a nice knock against the science of biology. Nice to know you're more committed to your ideology than to science.


Fine. Just be a decent human being and respect that some people will believe there are two genders and that "transitioning" doesn't change someone's actual gender. Just kidding. Be a standard human being who tries to exterminate those you don't agree with.

I don't think you're allowed to question the bias of left wing media outlets anymore. It's double plus ungood. You could lose your job.

The delusional era of the current age can be summed up by two widespread beliefs:
Bitcoin is not real money.
Caitlyn Jenner is a real woman.

I have no inside knowledge, but the source at bitcointalk is Bruno (Gleb Gamow, formerly Phinneas Gage). Bruno has a history of making wild unfounded accusations. At this point if he says it, I'm inclined to disbelieve it. If you read many of Bruno's posts, it's clear he's seriously mentally ill.

I hope everyone learned an important lesson from this. If you want to take a political stand of any kind, do it anonymously. Donate to the causes you support anonymously, using crypto.
You never know when your political opponents will come to power and punish you for your past digressions from their orthodoxy. And you have no way to predict how their orthodoxy may shift.

Sure. And lots of people stopped using Firefox when Mozilla choose to side with the SJWs. Both sides made a choice. Many people may choose to use Brave simply as another FU to Mozilla. Again, free choice.
I like free choice. It's best to minimize those situations where free choice isn't allowed to really important things like whether or not you have to bake a pizza for a gay wedding.

I'm sorry people are giving you a hard time. We bitcoiners should be more sympathetic. You've probably been holding fiat that's losing value while bitcoin's jumping 20% in a few days. I, for one, am sorry for your loss.

People should have whatever % they find appropriate. I don't consider it crazy.
Now, announcing that percentage on a public website, especially if connected using a home or work IP address. That's a little crazy.
