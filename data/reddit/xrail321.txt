So far this is false

For most people that HODL, actually.

Well first of all is just unreliable. Most markets you can predict pretty easily but with bitcoin it's all over the place. Bitcoins value has just been trending down for months now and any realistic analysis will tell you it's just going to keep doing that. Everyone here really wants it to go back up but that's only because they never sold when they should have. All these people are going to be HODLing for the rest of their lives. No companies are buying bitcoin like they have been saying they would for months. Why would they? There isn't really a need to. I'm sorry dude but you just need to admit that bitcoin is dieing. You are in denial.

You say that but there really is no evidence. Predicting the future is not a safe bet.

To not promote buying large amounts of bitcoin. That's all.

Don't take it personally. Believe it or not but I am actually trying to help you from losing money.

I never denied that there was money to be made with it. I have made a few dollars because of bitcoin. I'm just saying don't encourage people to put too much money into it because it's very unlikely it will go back up much more than 8k.

Not all market analysis is dumb. Bitcoin and other crypto currency analysis is pretty stupid though. They have been gained reputation of being very unreliable. Are you just one of the guys that put his life savings into Bitcoin? Are you waiting for your money to just magically come back?
@_date: 2018-06-18 02:48:45
You honestly believe bitcoins value will go back up?

No someday he'll look at 16k and cry because it'll be worth about 2k per coin lol
