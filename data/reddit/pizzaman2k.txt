I've also been very interested in building my own printer. Do you have a production printer or a homemade one? Any suggestions? I have some money to play with and invest a bit but I'm not willing to drop 1k+ on like a makerbot replicator just yet.

To be completely honest I've been toying with the idea of printing a few ar lowers for myself as my main goal, and then expanding further into what it can do. But honestly I have no idea where to start as this is a new field for me and I don't personally know anyone with any knowledge in the area and hate bothering people with questions about stuff.
Also, I'd like to say thank you for taking the time and effort to write such a thorough response.

Oh I'm sure you've been asked that quite a few times and I personally would have responded the exact same way. I don't break laws but especially firearms laws, that's butt hurt just waiting to happen. 
But I'm very interested in getting one if these built for myself, is there any sort of market for printing for others ( obviously legal items ) that I could possibly in time break even with the cost of hardware? What would a setup similar to yours cost and what would a mid level system cost? 
If you could possibly point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated. 
Feel free to pm me if you'd prefer.
Thanks again.
