Any currency is essentially a bubble that can only be poppped by other bubbles. The idea of bitcoin is to pop all the bubbles of the centralized national currencies that exist currently with an new, better, upgraded decentralized currency.

It would have some benefits, but it would miss out on the main benefit: decentralization. By definition, if the government made a currency—crypto or otherwise—it will be centralized, which defeats the whole purpose of bitcoin.

This might actually be genius, this guy probably got the advertisers on his website to pay for the advertisement for Bitcoin on the board.

The 100 trillion bill runs $100-150 on eBay, that’s most just because it is a novelty item that was only produced for 1 year which makes it fairly rare too. I don’t know what the value of the bill was prior to collectors, but in total OP could sell his whole set for about $200 probably.

I think he is more referencing the stereotype that all football players blow all of their money within 5 years of retirement (and it’s partially true).
