Won't a hardfork for a PoW change be equally messy then?

Such a waste of time drawing lines and projecting dreams. If TA, or any analysis worked for that matter, bots would make you a millionaire over night. Patterns are obvious in hindsight, yet a mere illusion when forecasted.

Nope but I think the roadmap for selling segwit to other alts should proceed, segwit coins have a lot of value it seems and they will proposer alongside satoshi bitcoin (today preserved in the form of bch).
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:37:21
They're in the business of profit taking rather than generating. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:01:23
No because you don't buy bitcoin for its relative fiat value, you buy bitcoin because fiat has no value. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:57:41
Don't forget about accepting money from institutional investors who, by the definition of everything bitcoin ever is, are certainly interested in bitcoin's prosperity and health.

Who in the fuck allows this puppetry on these forums?

Segwit coin maybe, it's too broken to do anything besides slowly depreciating as off-chain inflation kicks in. 
As for satoshi bitcoin, it will continue to become the world's uniting currency and the catalyst for society 2.0. 
Save your real coins and paper people, they'll be collector's items from history very soon.

I think it's good that way, this way we have segwit coins represented in btc and ltc, and non-segwit original satoshi-style bcc. I think that's better over all for the bitcoin experiment.

It's not turning a profit when you receive a bribe? God, I have no clue what better profit can a fiat-lover wish for.

Oh, my understanding was that Satoshi said miners protect the network as long as nodes don't use any altered PoW or different drastic changes. 
I think I'll just stick with the network with the largest number of miners (fastest harsh rate) as long as those miners objectively represent many actors as per my estimation. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 06:09:55
Unless, you know, the motives and the obvious conflict of interest are a deafening siren screaming bribe.

Isn't that after 2016 blocks? Don't you think this renders the network very vulnerable/spiralled until the DA?

If you understand cryptocurrency answer this: If I create a coin tomorrow, pre-mine it, give huge portions to family and friends, then huge portions to people I want in certain places, then offer some (maybe only 20%) for 1 USD a coin, and I call it WhateverCoin and on coinmarketcap it says the coin limit is: 27,000,000,000,000 coins. Will you buy it? What if you knew that the number will be 28,000,000,000,000 coins next year? 
Now, that's why bitcoin is a better choice.

In my opinion, it's side-trading all the way to the bottom now, until panic sets in.

That's a kickass job title.

I agree, however 1MB blocks today should be equally unargued for, no? Instead we're wearing no2x hats and tattoos.

Can I know why? In 1995, I used to think about downloading an MP3 song because it's 2mb and that will take forever and eat up from my precious 500 mb dial-up limit.
Today, I make the same calculation when it's 2gbs in comparison to my Internet's speed and 500 gb limit.
In 2030, it only makes sense that I will be making the same calculations downloading a 2tb ar/vr asset in comparison to my 500tb limit.
Your concern about infrastructure limitations cannot discount progress, if it does then you're antiquated and you might as well use AM/FM waves to trade bitcoin for all I care. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:24:25
Blockchain is not the innovation, bitcoin is.
Don’t let them change the narrative.
As for blockchain, every component in making one has existed for over 15 years now (as separate components of cryptography, networking, distributed concurrency control, etc...).
Blockchain bundles a set of technical decisions and couples them closely to a business problem. The innovation is in how coupled the business problems and technical solution are.
Blockchain is database concurrency control allowing for transparency among participants in a permissioned network.

In BTC, if hash rate drops we'll get slower blocks &lt; 1 per 10 minutes and that means many transitions will clog if miners ever get affected. Edit: that's a small/capped block limitation. 
In BCC, even if hashrate drops, a single block can clear many more txs per block even if it's &lt; than 1 block per 10 minutes.
How is BTC more resilient? Also gigabyte blocks and other blocksize projections will grow in proportion to infrastructure growth; the 1-2mb on today's internet will be equal 1-2gbs in 2030's internet.

Except, you can tell who's signalling for NYA.
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:17:44
I agree, but honestly it's better NYA happens or else miners will shift to BCC.

You want segwit and you want the SEC to regulate Bitcoin?
I'm not sure whether you missed the /s handle? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:04:39
Correct, while non-binding it's still an indication we can use to gauge hash-rate support, no?
