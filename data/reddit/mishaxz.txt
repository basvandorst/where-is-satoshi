Couldn't they just do that with an extension? Seems like overkill

people can make good money investing in the stock market without understanding that the reason it rises is because of money constantly being printed and needing some place to park itself

Btw how much are they now if you wanted to get your hands on one anytime soon?

the problem with the vision - if the vision is to have it a currency - is fundamentally flawed. It behaves like an asset (commodity). Why currencies work is because there is a constant tug of war between the main ones.. this keeps the value relatively stable. Imagine trying to run any economy when "money" is fluctuating like crazy, you can't. People actually start panicking (maybe even runs on the banks) when their currency hits double digit (%) losses. There's only one reason when wild fluctuation is good that I can think of... and that is to depreciate your currency to get out of the mess you're in. That way you can avoid relying on austerity. Countries like Greece found out the hard way what happens when you can't devalue. Whereas countries like Thailand and Russia quickly bounced backed from their crises (late 90s) through the magic of devaluation (i.e. becoming more competitive) - However I'm sure nobody is thinking to replace a national currency with Bitcoin... I'm just saying when you use something as "money" it's probably only going to work well if it is somewhat stable in value. Someone should make a cryptocurrency that has a limited range of fluctuation - the way that some currencies are only allowed to move in certain bands. If the goal is to actually use it as a currency. Stability is not a bad thing for a currency. Cyptocurrencies really need to be renamed Cryptocommodities or Cryptassets.

don't really get what is racist, just looks like a caricature to me... or do people mean that equating Koreans with Chinese is racist?

yeah why can't they make it like torrents? a bit here, a bit there, a bit more here and there for redundancy? maybe periodically making a "whole snapshot image" for archival or whatever purposes

if they ban whatever they are banning would Kreans still be allowed  to buy on non-korean exchanges?

yes but some countries, e.g. Canada didn't have any major bank problems. For 2 reasons: 1 AFAIK the banks need government mandates to establish a new bank, so it is highly consolidated there - and 2. it was more difficult to get a mortgage than in the US
So nothing is perfect, however if you have to put your money in a bank. Maybe better to choose a less free-wheelin' one. 
oh well, investing morally there's not really such a thing. IMO the attractiveness of something like Bitcoin is that you can exchange it for real things - which for the foreseeable future means fiat currency. Take that away and it's like kicking the legs out under a chair.

But would you really want an economy without any inflation either? That would be a recipe for disaster. Sure of course there is too much money printing due to banks not being tied down by sensible legislation anymore, hence they can cause crises at will but some inflation  (enough that you will not be happy with stuffing the money under the bed) is necessary for the way the economy runs. At least that's how I understand it.

Where can i find a list of jurisdictions ranked by how well the banks are regulated (for example some countries' banks couldn't make subprime nothing down style loans due to better regulation, right?)  and if they can gamble with the customers money or not?

Was Bitcoin actually originally intended to be a payment mechanism for shopping or just a way to send money around to other parties? More like a bank transfer I mean.. Maybe much of the problems with bitcoin as a payment mechanism is that it never was intended to be one?

Well reading up on it it sounds like an EU project to boost the economy.. So there's a reason it's "so cheap" meanwhile outside the EU banks are plenty happy to make some extra money

Yeah so far BitMex is the only exchange that has everything to be a good exchange for trading that I've found. . Good spreads, leverage, api. The forex brokers I've looked at seem to have spreads that are 3 times greater minimum 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:49:50
But unlike the uk version, I believe nobody cheated in the us one
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:57:29
Do you know any with good spreads though? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:45:28
My understanding is that bitcoin is a commodity, not a currency. . Is that wrong?

people write shitty and/or clickbait headlines everywhere not just in finance unfortunately. There are no standards in journalism anymore. Even typos are acceptable now. Proof-reading is passe
