Me just before the during the moon shot, after I swore to myself i'd HODL this time.  *sigh*

You should be able to send BTC to your Coinbase/GDAX wallet the same way you send payments.

But will 100,000,000 Satoshi be able to support the volume of transactions?  If you actually make Satoshi, bitcoin, and then start dividing up the newly labeled bitcoin into smaller fractional amounts then doesn't that negate the deflationary aspect of the 21,000,000 limit?

Mainstream media live to report the negative.

You're just moving labels, that does nothing to the actual numbers stored in transactions.  Imagine you have the numbers 1 and 0.00000001 on a white board and below them you have the labels "Bitcoin" and "Satoshi". You pull the label "Satoshi" off and toss it in the garbage and shift the label "Bitcoin" over to the decimal number. Now everyone that had 1 bitcoin can say they have 100,000,000 bitcoin, but the data hasn't changed.
Transactions on the blockchain don't store a decimal number representing the number of bitcoin in a transaction, they store an integer that represents the number of Satoshi in a transaction. So technically bitcoin is a label for a very large number Satoshi. I had always assumed that transactions stored a decimal value representing the number of Bitcoin in a transaction and that Satoshi was a label ascribed to a very small fraction of a Bitcoin.
Subdividing a Satoshi would require changing the code to now recognize the stored integer value in each transaction as a deci/centi/milli/micro-Satoshi instead of a Satoshi. The current int64_t value used to store this value in code could only store up to a milli-Satoshi before it would theoretically over run bounds of the data type. This would only be an issue if someone tried to send every bitcoin ever generated in a single transaction, but still there are limits. Bitcoin/Satoshi cannot just subdivide indefinitely. The math is limitless, but the hardware and software it runs on is not. But this is more of a thinking exercise than a real problem.
Just to be clear I understand why this isn't inflationary, just wondering about the technical issues of how it might be handled.

yes, but they'll still loose it.  And when gold is lost, there is a chance it will be found by someone and reenter the gold ecosystem. When a bitcoin key is lost, it's effectively irrecoverable by anyone, ever.

Everytime the EU changes their privacy regulations I get spammed by all of the sites I've ever signed up with for a month straight.

Except that gold (and technically even oil) isn't lost in the same way. If I loose a gold nugget, it still exist and can be found by me or someone else in the future, however unlikely that might be. With bitcoin, if you loose your keys, the coins associated with them are effectively lost to everyone. The data is still there, but it's rendered unfindable. If we were to get to to a point where computing power was sufficient to brute force the keys then you could access it but the ability to brute force the keys itself would render bitcoin worthless. So lost bitcoin is effectively wiped out of existence to everyone permanently. The only way that I currently know of to permanently (in theory) loose gold in this way, is by putting it on a space probe and launching it somewhere in deep space that humans cannot currently retrieve it from.

Much like the FIAT you're likely paid in at your job. If you made 100k this year, stored it all you house and you house burns down...you still own the IRS the tax revenue on that money.
I wonder how that will work out. If I bought 2 bitcoins at $1,000 each, then it appreciated to $10,000 over the year, $9,000 would be taxable as capital gains. If I then lost my private keys, The 2 bitcoins still exist, I just can't access it. If it then goes up to $20,000 the next year, the IRS will reasonably expect that I pay capital gains tax on $10,000. I can't prove a negative, that I lost them. It seems like they would simply have to accept your word for it. I'm betting one of the first regulations to come out will be that you have to report your ~~private~~ public keys to the IRS. This way if you report your private keys lost or irrecoverable they can check the public address to see if money is transferred to another address later. They will also define any unreported transactions legally as "money laundering" so that any attempt to no report is a felony.
Also if you bought in at an exchange like Coinbase/GDAX they maintain a record of the wallet that you transferred that crypto to. Since the transactions are public they can easily see if the money is every accessed or moved. Crypto is not a great way to launder money because there is a public record of every transaction and tying a person or entity to a wallet wouldn't be that hard for investigators to do.

Don't worry, if the bank fails you can just borrow money to bail them out and they can use that to restore your account balance. Problem solved, am I rite?

Probably true, but it's a long ride to Mars.

Pretty shitty hacker.  Should have waited until you funded the account at least
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:25:10
Is this real?  If so is only a matter of time before the SEC begins regulating crypto exchanges.
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:11:06
Yea, but that is more effort than technical know how that most of the people currently trading can handle.  It'll still severely depress the market, which will make offshore server and the hassle of setup them up and maintaining them less appealing to those who know how.
But I'm not expecting a ban or anything.  Just SEC regulations similar to what is currently in place for the stock market.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:54:37
Yea but how much value will you loose before you exit?
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:19:04
Awesome.  Now go out and figure out a solid way to put another 50-200 every month in some more.  When you are my age, you'll thank yourself!
@_date: 2017-07-07 11:08:07
Be vigilant, look at it, see how it works and manually duplicate it in a new sheet you created.  Problem solved.
