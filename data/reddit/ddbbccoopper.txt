I'm not selling because I don't want to deal with the tax implication, especially knowing that this market will eventually go back up.  You sold with profit so if you are a US citizen, the government is going to find out when they subpoena whatever exchange you used.  
Additionally, if I wanted to wait until all of the bullshit is purged from this marketplace, I'm afraid I would be waiting a seriously long time.

You can set the fees for the equivalent of roughly 50 cents and pay the $5.00 cost for the coffee.  The transaction will be recognized on the network within 10 seconds.  It just won't be verified until some time later.  It may be a couple hours or even a couple days using a low transaction fee.  However, the same thing happens with merchant using mastercard or visa.  They aren't getting credited for the transaction for a couple of days due to processing and they can also be subject to a chargeback anywhere between 30 to 90 days which they never have to worry about when Bitcoin is used.

If Coinbase would implement segwit it would be 1/2 that amount.  Additionally since coinbase is likely generating a majority of transactions hitting the network for purposes such as this, if they implemented segwit the mempool would decrease substantially.  Doing so would decrease the fees to the point that you would likely be paying an eighth of the fee you are now.  If other users of Bitcoin such as bitpay would implement segwit, you would likely pay pennies for the transaction.

The BCC fork is mining using the same difficulty as the Bitcoin fork.  because there is such a tiny fraction of hash power trying to mine at that difficulty, it will take an exponentially longer amount of time to find a BCC block.

I am a huge supporter of Bitcoin but every time I hear this argument have to point out how wrong it is.  Intrinsic value is simply a use case outside of simple store of value and therefore multiple uses to limit fluctuations in value.  The fact that it costs something to produce has no bearing on its value.  The fact that I spent 500 dollars for 2 guys to dig a giant  hole in my backyard using physical strength and machines to do it, does not add value to my property.  If I spend my entire life chopping trees into tiny pieces, the bits and tiny pieces are not worth the sweat equity I put into them.

On Bitthumb where most of the trading is taking place, they have 0% commission for certain traders thereby allowing wash trading for free.  Ver and Company can do their pump for free.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:40:04
The main point of support by Ver and big blockers is that they don't want layer 2 solutions.  They want all transactions on chain.  They don't necessarily dislike Segregated Witness, as they like and want the other solutions that segwit provides such as solve the problem of transaction malleability.  They just don't like that SegWit  opens door to layer 2.   
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:11:29
My conspiracy theory is that Ver and Wu have been wash trading this on bitthumb where they can do so with zero trading fees.  They needed to pump the price up of their coin to a high enough level so that the mining profitability is at least equal once the mining algorithm levels off.

If and when Bitcoin gets to 35000, there won't be a question of whether to hold or sell.  You will likely continue to make transactions using your regular fiat currency but will only keep enough of that fiat currency to make those smaller transactions and continuously replace your savings in bitcoin as a store of value that is immune from fiat inflationary risk.

You explain that its no different than any other fiat currency in existence today.  Its based on the mutual trust of the shared community who holds it, that it will hold value in the future to be traded for something else of value.  Ask him what he believes backs or gives value to the slip of paper in his wallet issued by the government.  Once people begin to get over the hurdle of understanding that money is simply a shared trust amongst others of a perceived value, Bitcoin becomes easier to understand.  I just think that before there can be a discussion of what Bitcoin is, people first need to simply understand what money is which 99.99% of the people don't seem to understand.

It is estimated that gold has a total world value of $7.7 Trillion.  Of course a large % of this is used for other purposes however lets just us a round figure like 5 Trillion for gold used as a simple store of value.  If Bitcoin could capture 10% of this market as a store of value it would put a bitcoin market cap at 500 billion.  Currently the Crypto market is at ~$180 Billion.  That's still a long way to go, simply to reach 10% of gold not considering the other Bitcoin use cases.

What is or isn't Bitcoin isn't determined by hashrate itself or some other tangible objective metric.  What is or isn't Bitcoin is a mindset of the majority of what they believe is Bitcoin and thereby the trust of the majority of which fork will hold a higher value over time.  That's why the proponents of SW2X will not implement replay protection and why its important fro them to convince exchanges to refer to the new chain as BTC for some arbitrary metric such as hashrate.

@_date: 2017-11-02 15:17:47
maybe, Maybe not.  As I just wrote in an earlier post, I'm not sure this plays out the same way as with BCH during the moments before and after the fork like many think. I think the majority of the miners signaling SW2X are never going to actually mine the new chain. There is no way they are willing to kill, or even harm, the goose that lays the golden eggs. Its not advantageous for them to do so. Once that happens the SW2X chain is going to die. Alternatively, the SW2X developers see this writing on the wall and finally decide to implement replay protection. in a sense, creating an altcoin similar to BCH. In either case, it will be a shot in the arm proving the invincibility of Bitcoins consensus structure. Once this happens, the big money sitting on the sidelines waiting for this to play out might come flowing in driving the BTC price up even more and alts twisting further in the wind. Then again, I could be completely wrong.

It happens all the time for small purchases (such as for coffee) and hundreds of thousands of merchants have already made the decision that the risk of a charge back or fraudulent transaction is worth it compared to waiting for a user or customer sign a receipt, work involved of managing all those slips of paper, or wait for a confirmation.

I've been saying since Litecoin was created that Charlie Lee is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  He simply understands the importance of being politically correct about it.  Make no mistake, Litecoin is competitor of Bitcoin, no different than any other altcoin.  People make the argument that Charlie Lee is somehow more altruistic than other altcoin/scamcoin promoters because he didn't have a premine or founders reward.  he didn't need to.  At the time, he created the first altcoin.  He was able to mine a vast number of early LTC just like Satoshi nakamoto mined a vast majority of Bitcoin.  Hence the moniker, SatoshiLite.  Bitcoin is being attached from every Vector and a lot of Bitcoin supporters are being fooled into thinking that Litecoin is somehow different.  Litecoin is a Trojan horse.

Think deeper.  If a believer in Bitcoin was scared to lose their money as your example suggests, they would convert all of their wealth into Bitcoin.  At some point, they will have to pay their bills, buy a car, house, food, enertainement etc to function in normal daily life.  They will ultimately be spending some of their bitcoins to do this thus creating a economic Bitcoin market.  Ultimately the Bitcoin price will stabilize at the point the Bitcoin economy becomes mature enough.  The reason for the current volatility is that the Bitcoin economy is still in its infancy and we are only at the tip of the iceberg.

Based on your question I would guess that you are an affluent (from a worldwide perspective) US citizen.  When it comes to a resident of the US, it might not seem very beneficial over other alternatives. Its not.  Put yourself, however in another place which is where the vast majority of people of the world fit.  Consider yourself in a country where inflation is rampant.  Bitcoin is a much better store of value.  Consider yourself in the position of a suppressed minority person that can have their belongings easily stolen or confiscated.  Bitcoin is easily a store of value.  Consider yourself in a position where you have no access to banking which is much of Africa and Asia.  Bitcoin provides these people the opportunity safely store and exchange their wealth (as minimal as it may seem to you).  Besides these use cases, there are others that have yet to be developed.  Up until what is being developed now there has been no viable way to make payments (other than in person cash payments) for less than 50 cents.  What may seem trivial individually has the potential to be massive collectively.  
Try to think beyond your own perspective.  the vast majority of the world does not live with the privileges and benefits that you enjoy and its this world that Bitcoin has the potential to benefit the most.

Although it seems your mind is made up, I'll chime in anyway to agree with others to say that TA does not work.  It particularly does not work in the crypto space where news and opinion have such a radical effect on valuations.  Past price performance has no bearing on news coming out.  Lets say that yesterday you have a classic cup-and-handle weekly chart, or some bullshit head-and-shoulders daily, or classic 9 candle witchcraft that gives you a strong buy signal.  None of this tealeaf-reading bullshit would matter if news came out today that the trustee in the Mt. Gox case decided to distribute the ~220,000 bitcoins to outstanding MtGox creditors.  It could have happened.  releasing that many bitcoins on the market would have resulted on downward pressure on the price.  No amount of TA can account for the news coming out.  Similarly, those various charts and patterns are a result of past news that have no bearing on future performance.  TA is a bullshit scam.

No way.  We haven't begun to see the fight come out yet.  This is bankers simply snickering at what they believe is the whole laughable crypto space.  Which is good.  We need a whole lot more momentum before they begin to fight.  Once bitcoins price reaches ~10K I expect the fight to begin.  Look for developers such as Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum, Evan Dufield of Dash, Ricardo Spagni of Monero and others to be jailed temporarily or possibly extensively.  The onramps such as Coinbase will be shut down and finally exchanges will be regulated into nonexistance.  
The rocky road to this point has been completely internally driven among cryptocurrencies themselves.  The external fight hasn't even started and Jamie Dimon simply calling Bitcoin a fraud is a blip on the radar compared to what's coming.

Also, there are likely other respondents similar to me that will never answer, or at least answer truthfully, some of your questions considering that the answers to this survey are not anonymous and can be tied to a google account.

In simple terms, a central bank would not create a separate cryptocurrency because it undermines the value of their existing currency.  Keep in mind that any proposal you suggest would basically destroy the credibility of the banks existing system for which its protection is their primary concern.
What you're suggesting is that central banks fully admit to Bitcoins validity, submitting to it as the future of currency and that they actively compete against it as an altcoin.  As said, this would destroy their existing currency and would likely never be adopted for ceentralization reasons pointed out by others posting answers to your question. 
Practically, there is no way a central bank could do this because they would have to give up their model of fractional reserve.  The whole stated purpose of a central bank is to control the money supply for the stated purpose of creating stability.  Having a publicly accessible blockchain  based cryptocurrency would prevent this.  
Based on your question, I would highly suggest that you read or listen to the audio recording of "The Creature from Jekyll Island." by G. Edward Griffin.  Even if you get through the first couple chapters, and even if you discard what some might consider conspiracy theories, you will likely begin to understand the purpose and organziation of central banks and how they play a role in the existing money supply.

I agree with you that there are some short term patterns that you can pick up such as a Sunday dip.  I tend to notice that from 3 to 4 pm EST  the price of bitcoin seems to drop a little while from 4 to 6 it tends to come back a bit.  Maybe Asia is waking up right about that time.  Maybe its the end of the day in the US giving people a chance to reassess their position.  Who knows but maybe I'm also looking for a pattern that doesn't really exist.  I'm not betting on it though.  There may be more complex patterns as well but this only involves even more variables that the ridiculous cup and handle, reverse triangles  wedges etc will account for.  And no matter what,  as I said previously, nothing can account for news releases for which in as fluid market as crypto, there are many way too numerous to count.

I think that he's pulling some sort of wolf-in-sheep's-clothing strategy. He's ego-maniacal enough to think that he can do such a thing.  I have the impression that he has grown tired of trying to educate people by pointing out the advantages of Bitcoin and instead he is passive-aggressively playing some sort of reverse-psychology game. I get the impression that he is trying to compliment Ethereum enough to draw in a new audience and subtly plant the seed of doubt by pointing out Ethereum's flaws. Richard Heart has too much of an ego admit that he was wrong about something and suddenly jump all in on something like Ethererum which if you listen to this podcast, he still doesn't believe in.  Like you pointed out, he believes that most people are stupid/lazy and can't think for themselves, which to a certain small extent I agree with.  Believing this, he probably thinks that the passive-aggressive approach might be more fruitful.  He's probably right.  Going on like he was promoting Bitcoin in the past was merely preaching to the choir.  By slightly promoting ethereum, he attracts a newer audience that he feels he can educate.  Its a pretty egotistical and paternalistic strategy that may actually have some success.   
He's a smart guy but sometimes smart people are too smart for their own good.  If this is actually what he is doing, I think it really diminishes his reputation in the long term Bitcoin hodler community which is really what his ego is seeking the acceptance of.   These are just my thoughts and I might be completely off.

I think you're getting confused between what electronic cash is compared to what a separate cryptocurrency.
*did creating electronic checking accounts, wire transfers, debit cards, etc undermine the dollar? No.*
These are all services based on the existing fiat system.  What you're proposing is a government central bank suddenly stating that, besides this current money (which is provided by our central bank) that we require payments to be made to the government be made in, we'll also now allow the use of this other currency as well. 
*Not necessarily, they could inflate the crypto-currency. It doesn't have to be capped like BTC.*
How is that any different from what they do now and what would be the benefit to a central bank of creating a separate crypto then?

I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but prior to the BCH fork, everyone was advising anyone with their BTC funds on an exchange to get them off in order to have control of their private keys.  I'm just wondering why some people did not take this advice?  Did some think that the funds they had on the exchange were too minimal to matter?

Nobody has the answers to those questions.  If everyone had answers to those questions, the price of Bitcoin would be either $1M/coin or $0/coin.  (or somewhere in between.)  Currently the collective wisdom of everyone who owns Bitcoin believes that the answers to those questions give it a current value of around $4,150.  That's how markets work.  As the answers to those questions become more apparent, the valuation will go up or down.  It's up to you to decide if you think the answers will have a positive or negative impact on its price and thus hold or sell accordingly.

Conference calls usually last about 1/2 hour.  I'm afraid that this is all unfounded pure speculation and the price of Bitcoin will drop 2-3% immediately after the call.  I would absolutely love for Amazon to accept Bitcoin but I don't think it will.  After the Mt. Gox crash in late 2013 I think that the Jan 2014 announcement by Overstock.com to accept Bitcoin and its ongoing support was one of the key events that helped prevent Bitcoin from crashing even lower throughout the rest of the year than it did.   Amazon's acceptance when it does come will help legitimize Bitcoin for many of those who still believe Bitcoin is just used by drug sellers and ransome-ware creators.  I just don't think it will happen today.  I hope that I'm wrong.

Its not a question of "IF".  The Segwit2x hard fork will happen.  All it takes is one miner to create a hard fork.  I could create a hard fork tomorrow changing the max amount of coins to 42M rather than 21M.  Nobody would support it however and it would basically be an overall no-event.  
The same is true with Segwit2x.  If nobody supports it, it won't be worth anything.  What makes you think that it would be the most profitable chain?  Valuation is based on supply and demand.  If users don't want it and won't use it, it won't be worth anything and therefore no miner is going to waste their hashing power on something that's worthless.  this is true whether they signed some agreement 3 months ago saying they would support it or not.

The A  thing to do is always control your own private keys.  Once you have received Bitcoin from coinbase simply transfer them to an address where you and only you have access tot the private keys.  The easiest route is simply go to bitaddress.org , create a new address with public and private keys and simply transfer your bitcoins to that address.  Once this is done, you know that your coins will be safe, no matter what happens, as long as you have access to the private key.  Once you learn more how to split your coins and separate the new forked coins you can do so, but you will be rest assured that your bitcoins will be safe as long as you hold the private keys.

Stability is relative.  If your primary currency is a Venezuelan Bolivar I doubt that you have any concern over bitcoins volatility.  The concern over this issue is a very US dollar-centric perspective.  Additionally, volatility is expected and if anything shows how Bitcoin is merely at the tip of the iceberg of any kind of real adoption.  I don't understand what people expect.  they want a full fledged digital currency that replaces the current fiat system but expect it to be dropped in their lap without any sort of price fluctuation.  It doesn't happen that way.  Nothing would.  
Why has the price risen so high?  Its for all the reasons you cited.  Once again, everything is relative.  While you may ask, why has it risen so high, someone else who uses or has invested in bitcoin regularly may ask, why is bitcoin's valuation so low.

I'm not sure what correspondence-course law school Korberos went to, but I wouldn't want to take any legal advice from him.  Bitcoins are property and thus any property owned by an individual is considered part of their estate and will legally pass based on the rules of succession of the state in which he resided.  Property will pass to his beneficiaries if a will exists (Benefactor is the wrong term), and if no will exists, it will pass by way of rules of intestacy for his state.
As everyone else has commented, you will need his private keys in order to access them if he held them directly.  If you don't have the private keys, their gone.   If he held them on an exchange, you will need his password in order to access his account.  If you do not have the password for the account you may want to contact the exchange and see if they have any internal rules for such situations.  Your chances of recovering any bitcoins without private keys or passwords are likely pretty slim.

I never understood the main assumption of Keynesian philosophy which, as you noted, was that inflation was necessary to force people to spend their money.  It requires the assumption that people will go through life and never buy a house, cars, clothes, food, entertainment, etc. but simply spend their life naked in a cave hoarding money.   If central planners would simply stay out of the situation and stop messing with the money supply through inflation, the system would naturally find equilibrium.  
I find it analogous to the argument that hunters are necessary to hunt deer in order to control the population.  On the other hand, if nature could naturally take its own course, the population would be taken care of itself without intervention.  (Not that I have a problem with hunting, I just find this argument to be flawed.)

I'm not arguing with you.  I agree that the actual utility right now is small and speculation is high.  Speculation is driving bitcoin's utility as a currency.  That utility is growing and thus speculation increases.  How is this whole thing different than a bunch of investors fighting over 21 million shares of a company?  There is none.  You seem to insinuate that there is something wrong with that.  The difference with Bitcoin unlike stocks in a company is that you can use it as a currency whereas a stock share you can't.  
Let me ask this.  Do you own Berkshire Hathaway stock?  Would you like to?  Why?  it's stock in a company that doesn't even pay dividends.  By your reasoning, BH stock has even less utility than Bitcoin.  Yet its probably the most coveted stocks held by investors.  Why?  Because of the faith of holders belief that it will retain its value.  Its no different with Bitcoin.

The Willy bot was internal.  Mt. Gox needed to keep the price ever increasing in order to prevent any sort of run on clients taking Bitcoin of the exchange.  Mt. Gox was running a fractional exchange since the day Mark Karpeles bought the exchange from Jed McCaleb.  Karpeles even knew this.  Shortly after the sale was the flash crash when even more bitcoins were lost by the exchange.  What caused this?  Through a hack into Jed McCaleb's old administrator account that was never closed.  (See a pattern here?)  By this point Mt. Gox was running an extremely thin fractional exchange.  Then in the fall of 2013, the FBI takes down the silk road.  Because the FBI was putting heat on Karpeles to provide info on Silk Road, even investigating Mark himself as DPR, Karpeles was very willing to help.  When the FBI took down Ross Ulbricht, Mark Karpeles quickly handed over the Silk Road bitcoins in the Mt. Gox account.  This made Mt. Gox fractional reserves even thinner.  As a result, Mt. Gox absolutely could not have even the slightest run on any clients taking any more bitcoins off of the exchange. This is where the use of the Willy bot came in. Unfortunately the bubble burst in November 2013 and Mt. Gox could not keep up, even with the use of internal buying bots.  Once the trend went from buying to selling and people tried to pull bitcoins off the of the exchange, Mt. Gox couldn't make good.  It was a classic Ponzi scheme.  Looking back, where did the bitcoins really go?  Not to Mark Karpeles because he never had them.  He's the dopey-dipshit fall guy.  The real person to investigate:  Jed McCaleb.

Really? You're sticking up for this Wang Chun piece of shit?  This guy is exactly what Bitcoin does not need and gives Miners a bad reputation for manipulation.  
Everyone spews hate against Jihan Wu as a bad actor in the Bitcoin space.  Maybe from a users perspective he is, but at least I can understand his motivations.   Whether he opposes segwit because he is protecting his interest in AsicBoost or whether he feels slighted by Core developers in not going along with the Hong Kong agreement when the rug was pulled out from under him, he has valid personal/capitalistic reasons for doing so.
Wang Chun however has no reason for pulling the shit he pulled when Litecoin was attempting to implement segwit.  He was clearly manipulating the market leading up to signaling for segwit.  Immediately before the full signaling period began, he tweeted out that he was not going to signal causing a crash in the price.  Charlie Lee had to contact him personally and grovel that he do so.  This is fact, not FUD.  I have no doubt there was a payoff involved.  
A similar situation would be if Bip91 does not lock in this signaling period and again, just prior to the next period, Wang Chun manipulates the market, creating a buying opportunity for himself by hinting that he does not plan to signal for the next.  A crash in price ensues, but then he ultimately signal.  This guy is a piece of shit. If this is rude, so be it.

I couldn't agree more.  I was going to post the same thing but you beat me to it.  I think he got paid off in some way by Charlie Lee before signaling segwit for good. I would bet he is doing the same thing again.

Aside from the overblown hype of what a smart contract is, smart contracts don't do anything other than perform fund distribution based on a oracle determined event.  Reading various articles/opinions you would think smart contracts can make me breakfast and cut my lawn.  Who knows, maybe I'm wrong.  However I'm open for someone to please explain how a smart contract can "perfectly" perform the integration of segwit into the Bitcoin protocol or increase its block size.

This is a nice read, however any article that includes Ethereum as having a similar future as Bitcoin is immediately suspect.

Wang Chun is a cocksucker and played multiple games during the time period litecoin was signaling to implement segwit.  Anyone who followed litecoin at that time remembers how he would start and stop signaling based on various whims.  I would go so far as bet that he was extorting Charlie Lee.   I have zero doubt that he is doing the same in attempt to gain attention to himself for whatever reason.

His name is Jed McCaleb.

Until Bitcoin, when did Central banks feel the need to warn people about things that they bought or sold.  In essence that's what we are doing.  We're buying these electronic tokens for fiat currency and them use them for something else. 
An analogy would be going to a casino and buying chips to gamble with.  I've never heard of a central bank issuing a warning against the purchase of gambling chips.  So what makes them feel the need to do so with Bitcoin?

Light candle, ring bell, read book.  It works in Zork.

It's coming from the ETH fans.  Roger and Jihan are an easy target but its Ethereum that has the biggest incentive to disrupt Bitcoin.  Keep the controversy spotlight on Bitcoin rather than on their own issues.

Litecoin didn't have the same MSM free publicity behind it that BTC will when SW gets activated to keep interest in it.  Additionally the time period between locking in and activating is much shorter than it was with LTC.

"I have an HD 7950, which I use in my gaming computer and I just want to test bitcoin mining to see whether it would be of any benefit to me."
It's not.

I don't see any fundamental difference in the two.  With Bitcoin you own a percentage of the perceived value of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.  With BH, you own a percentage of the perceived value of the of the entire BH ecosystem.  Valuation of anything is all perception of the group holding whatever that is.  There is no such thing as "inherent" value.
So popular sentiment is that Bitcoin is a good investment or not.  You don't.  That's how price discovery works and it's up to each person individually.      
(Sidenote: You and I have drastically different ideas of what would be "pretty neat")

(sigh) Why is this any different from the thousands of other similar articles?
