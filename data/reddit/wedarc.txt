And this is why Mining BTC is the most stable way to profit consistently...even these days. The extreme appreciation value, the potential it holds...

Thats not exactlya catch. Ice Rock Mining, Miner one, ETC. Take much more than 20%. They take closer to 50% and bill it as a lifetime contract where they reinvest for you. Elevate distributes from 80% of the profit pool and keeps 20% to run everything smoothly with security, engineers and maintenance.
 You get your investment protected because if anything happens to the ASIC, you get the same portion of profits from the total of the pool every single month no matter what, and Elevate runs your ASIC for you on a livestream 24/7.
@ $9,500 per BTC you are looking at about $140 per month. Just accumulating BTC though right now...is where the real value is at.

It is more profitable to mine crypto when investing in one mining operation 
 in comparison to another is what I mean, some charge exuberant fees and some do not. Some get better electricity rates than others, etc. Thats why I posted this
