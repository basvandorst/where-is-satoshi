Yes, but if they make now a mistake or die there won't be a stupid heir taking their shit.

I just don't get why Satoshi didn't see it coming.

Actually it's proven to be unhealthy to play any type of lottery since it induces unreachable fantasies which give you a fake dopamine hit that's supposed to be only activated in realisable scenarios.

Some websites offer free trials and require you to prove that you're not a bot. So mining for a little bit of time would be like paying for it and not worth for botnets.

What is casually playing the lottery if I may ask?
Once a month?
