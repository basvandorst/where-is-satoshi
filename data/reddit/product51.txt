This has nothing to do with Bitcoin. QR Code payments via Alipay or WeChat pay is a way of life in China.

You fuck - this is not bitcoin payment. Learn before you speak.

Here comes a noob using the Venezuela argument again!

When you type lol do you seriously lol? Bloody imbecile illiterates who have no idea of how economies work and keep on pumping their beloved crypto the moment a fiat currency going down. Where were your lols when bitcoin went down by 70% since the beginning of the year? Ohh wait - the window we are considering here is only the past week, aren't we?

All these look so ugly..

Stupid blind faith with no logic. Dicks who have invested at ATH and now are trying to prod the public to buy more to increase demand.
@_date: 2018-06-27 06:07:30
Haha - someone is trying to pump so that he can dump!

I thought he was fighting the India-Pakistan battle near the Kashmir border!

No it is not. ICO ads are still banned.

You stupid fuck. Bitcoin is not about being used as a currency. It is about store of value. Think of it like gold. You use it to store your wealth and convert it to money quickly when you feel like.
But then, you would know this if you actually had wealth.

What bullshit. I know we are all disapp with the current prices but don't post such things which reeks of desperation.
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:34:06
Yes let us buy now so that OP can sell.

They are doing the right thing. India is a heaven for black money and the govt needs to ensure that it doesn't head into crypto land. Crypto is a cesspool of humanity and the first adopters aren't technologists but the folks who have avoided taxes all along.

To claim that Shopify and WTW are more household names than BTC in 2016 just shows how blind people become when they hold crypto and rooting for it to pump all the way round.
If you don't believe me, ask a few people near you if they know about Shopify and WTW and you will know what I mean.

Stupid pumping headline. There was always custodial services available for crypto with product like Xapo. This is just another player in the market. While this may be incremental, $10B+ is absolutely bs.

Oh hear comes another expert. Let me explain what people like you are called - imbeciles.

Most people are jealous that some one else got a great car and they didn't. Which is when then they start comforting themselves that at least they didn't buy the lambo.

You are a dog so obviously you won't understand why inflation is necessary in this world.
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:09:00
Oh yeah? Can you tell when was the last time US or UK did this?
Bitcoin is not a replacement of currency notes. It is a store of value. Get that in your head. Or I bet you don't even understand what I am talking about here. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:07:38
Yeah - you have no idea how inflation works and why it is necessary. Bloody ignorant fucks who eat shit for their breakfast and start commenting like they know the world.
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:12:17
This is an absolutely bullshit reason to believe in bitcoin.
Conversely, stable countries such as US and UK never had to shit like this. Does this mean BTC doesn't make sense there?
@_date: 2018-04-20 02:50:21
Thanks for confirming that you eat pieces of shit for breakfast.
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:57:32
2008 resulted in 0 inflation you dick. There is a reason why interest rates fell to 0 after that.
This is why fucks like you are just intolerable to argue with.
