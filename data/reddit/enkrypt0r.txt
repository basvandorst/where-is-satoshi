Nah dude, that was a little flash crash blip.  We've seen them before and we'll see them again.  I'm not even convinced we're in for a big, abrupt crash—it could be a long war of attrition where the price just kind of deflates and interest sort of dwindles.

Yes, yes.  I'm referring to places where prostitution is already illegal.  If hookers are legal where you live, than it's probably just as legal to pay them with Bitcoin, cheeseburgers, etc as it is with cash.

It is not an *ad hominem* attack, because I did not use those personal attacks as evidence in an argument.  You forget that *ad hominem* is short for ***argumentum*** *ad hominem*, i.e. using personal attacks as justification for your point of view.  If it's not an argument, it's not *ad hominem*.

Yes, I would use a phrase colloquially.  Sometimes when I say "theory", I really mean hypothesis.  Sometimes I really mean theory.  It depends on the context.
Language is fluid.  The words and phrases you use now are different than the ones used a hundred years ago.  Ever wonder how they change?  It's not like some committee decides a word has a different meaning or connotation and then it's in the dictionary that way.  Words change through new usage--misuses, some might say.  It's part of language.
I think at this point you kind of know you're wrong, but it's a matter of pride for you to retain your position which you didn't really reason yourself into.

PR is not just sweeping stuff under the rug.  Reporting and fixing problems responsibly is not mutually exclusive from good PR.  In fact, it helps PR.  Yes, some entities might use PR in the manner which you describe, but it is by no means the only thing PR is.

That isn't a problem.  It simply means that many different people can take many different approaches to solving problems, which is generally a good thing.  PR can be implemented by many entities in many ways with regards to many aspects of Bitcoin.
PR is also not about discouraging people from doing their own research.  PR does not have to be, "Hey, here's the facts.  Don't believe anyone who tells you anything other than this."  PR does not have to be an authority, merely a force to guide people toward helpful, accurate information so individuals can verify facts for themselves.
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:07:32
Ummm... no.  I am just able to balance my interest in Bitcoin with logic and reason.  Of course Shrem is innocent until proven guilty, but if he did in fact do what he is accused of doing, then he deserves to go to jail.  It's as simple as that.  
For the record, I've been a "Bitcoin fanboy" since the summer of 2009.  I am more invested in Bitcoin than you are, I know more about it than you do, and despite all that, I am still capable of critical thought.

If you look back to the silk road bust, many of the most-upvoted comments on threads regarding DPR were obnoxious conspiracy theories about how he was set up and how it couldn't have been him and how he was framed.  They threw out all reason and went along with something which was very unlikely compared to the truth just to try and retain their world-view.  It was fucking ridiculous.
I think many laws are unjust, but that doesn't make it surprising when someone gets arrested for breaking them.  Once again, see the waitress analogy above.

I current use the Citi Forward card.  I get 5 ThankYou reward points for every dollar spent on Amazon.  Each point is current worth 0.8 cents (inflation, much?) on Amazon and integrates pretty seamlessly.
5 points * 0.8 cents = 4 cents.  Thus, I get 4% back on Amazon purchases for using the card, and it's all integrated and seamless.
I think the "discount for Bitcoin" thing has potential, but it has to include bigger savings and/or (preferably and) better integration.  It current has neither, even with external services like Gyft.  I'm a huge BTC supporter and have been since the early days, but we haven't won this one yet.

You know how to get a girl to like you?  You stop trying.  Trying to make a girl like you who doesn't, or even who's neutral, only makes her resent you.  Instead you need to do your own thing, improve yourself, and have a good time on your own.  Eventually, she'll see that you're a great, fun-loving guy and she'll be the one coming after you.

You cannot sit there and tell me that we don't have a tremendous lack of critical analysis by a majority of our userbase and a tremendous excess of confirmation bias and wishful thinking.  It wasn't always that way.  Yes, of course we have gained many new, great minds in the last few years, but we've gained orders of magnitude more dummies.
I'm not acting high and mighty because of some sort of seniority, I'm just saying that I take great pains to avoid fallacious thinking and to be objective, and it's frustrating when others fail to make even a vague attempt to do the same.
Also, I'm not saying that those people *deserve* to go to jail, but no one should be surprised if they do.  People who break the law tend to go to jail, regardless of how just that law is.  Have I broken unjust laws?  Of course!  Do I have a right to be surprised if I pay for it?  No, that's moronic.
Once again, I'll reference the waitress analogy above.

My only sore spot is the one developed from watching a decent community turn into a bunch of circlejerking shitdicks.  There is next to zero critical thought or analysis here.  It's always the same morons upvoting each other's opinions which are obscured by confirmation bias and wishful thinking and downvoting anyone who disagrees.
People can no longer fathom the possibility that someone involved in Bitcoin could break the law and instead they invent complex schemes and conspiracy theories to explain away an arrest, when the simplest answer is obviously the right one.  Shrem most likely broke the law, most likely did it knowingly, and most likely deserves to go to jail.  Whether or not the law is just has no bearing on the fact that it's a law.  If you know it's on the books and it's enforced and you break it anyway, then you deserve what you know you're going to get.  If you don't like a law, do something to get it changed.  Breaking it in an attempt to get it changed is like not tipping a waitress because you don't believe in tipping.  You're doing nothing to change the laws and culture surrounding tipping; you're just fucking over a waitress.
This community was once incredible.  Now it's one huge circlejerk--and not a friendly one.

Okay, Captain Strawman.
There is **no** reason why something cannot be fantastic in its own right and still make use of PR.  Some of the best charities in the world, ones who spend money responsibly, have objectively fantastic causes and are almost without fault use PR and use it well.
I do think that Bitcoin probably *could* stand in its own right, as the internet did, and show that it's awesome because it is, but there is simply no reason why ethical PR cannot be employed.  Something tells me you're going to take issue with the phrase "ethical PR".
Problems, solutions, benefits, etc. with regards to Bitcoin can be talked about in an *accurate* manner.  Sometimes that's all PR is.  Changing the spin of something from oversimplified to accurate or misinformed to informed.  PR can be used to correct things which are incorrect.  It's not all about lying, sweeping problems under the rug, moving focus away from issues, or exaggerating benefits.
PR can be used to provide *accurate* information.  Somehow, I still get the feeling that we are not going to agree and we're wasting our time.

People are getting caught up in the rush and some of those people will panic and sell.  A bulk of the people who have bought up in the last day or two are not bitcoin enthusiasts who are legitimately interested in bitcoin, its future, its applications, etc.  A bulk of them know nothing but "UP UP UP UP IT'S GOING UP I GOTTA BUY."
I certainly doesn't seem quite as bad as last time (and there were more factors lading to the crash last time) but we will see a correction.  I have no idea if that means going to 30 or 20 or 2, but I really do think it's going to happen.  I've put my money where my mouth is and liquidated.  Hopefully, if it does drop I'll be able to buy back in and get more bitcoins.  I love bitcoin, and anything I can do to get more of them sounds great to me.
Of course, I'm only handling my money.  If you think that we're not on a bubble now, then you have no reason not to keep buying them up at 40.  Either way, long live bitcoin!  :)

That's just it-- you didn't just name the wrong altchain.  You took a property of another altchain, a useless one, and said that it was a property of PPCoin.  There is zero difference between doing that with an altcoin and doing that with Bitcoin.  You are displaying a tremendous amount of cognitive dissonance at the moment, because you would definitely be annoyed if someone said that Bitcoin had some property which it didn't.  I get annoyed when people say, "Yeah, but anyone could forge/hack/whatever Bitcoins, it's just electrons!"  Yeah, I get annoyed by that too, and it's because it's *incorrect*; it's *false*.  It's a property of other digital things, but not Bitcoin.
Likewise, you have done the same for another coin.  You displayed ignorance as opposed to learning something.  Doesn't it worry you to wonder how many of your opinions are based on falsehoods?  Don't get me wrong, I fully support your right to dislike anything for any reason, but I want your reasons to be **facts**.  If you dislike PPCoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin, or anything else that's okay, but when your first line of defense is patently false, then how can your opinion be respected as informed?
Futhermore, by calling any open-source software a "Ctrl C Ctrl V" counterpart" of its base code, you're pretty much spitting in the face of all open-source software.  Hell, half the software you use probably falls into the "Ctrl C Ctrl V" category.  Going further, "Ctrl C Ctrl V" implies that there are no changes or improvements.  PPCoin has some major differences, and I find it rather innovative in terms of the technology, philosophy, and economic theory.  Whether or not these differences are improvements is debatable, but it's certainly not *just* a Bitcoin ripoff like some altcoins.
**TL;DR**  You are entitled to your own opinion, but not your own facts.

I agree that too many people call too many things a bubble.  The bubbles I'm talking about are the ones similar to that one in the past 24 hours.  When it went up to nearly $150/BTC in a few hours, it was an extremely obvious bubble.  Sure enough, it popped.  The parabola just couldn't have been sustainable.  I mean... did anybody who was watching it climb up past $145 think "Oh wow, it's just gonna keep going to 200!"?  No, of course not.  The walls were razor thin and there was very little support behind that large number.  Of course, saying this all in retrospect puts me in a spot where I can't prove that I said it, but I did actually tell my girlfriend about how it was sure to come down.
Some people maintain that Bitcoin itself is a big bubble.  *That's* something I take issue with.

Just liquidated.  There's no way this is sustainable.  The real question is where we land when the bubble bursts.  The big buy wall looks like it could probably catch a sell-off, but eventually the people who bought into the rise will panic and sell.  I'll be buying back it at (what I hope is) the bottom.  For now, this is looking more and more like the last crash.  This one had a slower initial ramp-up, but things are really speeding up now.

This is a great writeup with a lot of great points, but you glossed over one biggie that I'm unable to work around in my head.  You mentioned the following problem:


You addressed this by saying that this problem would be solved with "new ways of thinking", which is entirely possible, but you can't just relegate a problem to "we'll figure it out" and call it solved.  This is a major, *major* problem.

Agreed.  Some would call it semantics, but that's definitely not a crash.  When it loses 80% or 90% of its value overnight... then it can be called a crash.  Today was a little bubble and a little pop, but I'm sure that'll be followed up with more steady, healthy growth.

I think they do align.  Maybe he didn't articulate it perfectly, but I think he means that no one likes paywalls that cost a substantial amount of money.  Some sites will charge a few bucks just to read for the day, but 0.0001 BTC is currently about two cents.  
OP is talking about microtransactions.  I think he's saying that with BTC, newspapers could charge a very reasonable amount whereas charging a reasonable amount with USD tends to be difficult because of all the fees involved.
Could a site sustain itself on two-cent daily subscriptions?  Probably not, but it could be used in conjunction with other revenue streams.
Either way, it's interesting to think about.
For the record, I really **really** hate content blockers, but you never know what the future holds.

That's true, but the last several digits of precision are (for the near future, at least) useless.  One Satoshi is one one-hundred-millionth of one bitcoin.  They won't be worth a buck until one bitcoin is worth $100,000,000 (or even a cent until a bitcoin is worth $1,000,000).

**Litecoin** is definitely picking up steam, even though I'm not sure what they really bring to the table.  It is nice that it's harder to design an ASIC for them, because I find it a little disheartening that in order to mine, people have to spend a lot of money on these dedicated rigs that are only produced by a few companies.  Litecoin tried to remedy that problem, but by doing so, are more open to a 51% attack.  I'm not entirely sure this security problem is worth making the mining situation a little nicer.
**Namecoin** is definitely a fascinating concept, but I'm not sure it's really cut out to be a currency.  I like the idea of an alternate, blockchain-based DNS, but I don't know if I really can see why an economy should be built around it.  It's fascinating, but I don't think I really have much interest in having any stake in it (unless I want to create a .bit site for some reason, I guess).
**PPCoin** is *massively* underrated at the moment, in my humble opinion.  The combined Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake is really interesting.  It's still sort of in the testing phase, I guess, but if all goes well I think this one may be a winner.  It's designed to be energy-efficient, something which all other coins (especially scrypt-based coins) haven't seemed to have really seemed to have any interest in pursuing.  It was somewhat reliant on central-checkpointing for awhile, but it looks like that's been some away with, which is fantastic news for decentralization.  Overall, this is definitely my favorite up-and-comer.

I agree, but I guess that makes the real problem the enthusiasts.  I mean, obviously I get that enthusiasts should be enthused, but that doesn't mean they can disregard things like the bubble we're on now.  I think it's possible to be level-headed and realistic and remain super enthused about bitcoin.  I know that I am.  I just have never understood everyone's failure to look at everything, even the things they love, objectively.

I don't think we can really assume they average out without seeing all of the numbers, can we?  When we know that variable X is skewed up by some amount and down by some amount, we don't really know if its final value is greater than, less than, or equal to its original value.
I certainly agree that these numbers can be useful in the context of time, i.e. we can see if countries are becoming more saturated with Bitcoin users over time based on these numbers, however I don't think they're necessarily reliable numbers in and of themselves.

It's good to be skeptical about everything, for one.  Also, as I said, I'm not saying that his conclusion is necessarily wrong.  I'm saying that his way of reaching it is convoluted and is not a defensible train of thought.  There is nothing wrong with wanting people on *both* sides of any argument to put a little critical thought into their arguments.  
I'm sick and tired of people accepting shitty arguments just because the conclusion is favorable to them.  You should be skeptical about **everything**.  You should question **everything**.  It doesn't matter what the argument it; it should be a sound argument.  
**Accepting poor arguments as valid because the conclusion is favorable is the cancer of progress.**

I mean... the ironic part is the whole, "Milhouse is not a meme" meme first arose out of this exact situation.  Some b/tard (I think) was trying to make Milhouse from The Simpsons into a meme, and everyone told him that memes couldn't be created intentionally like that.  Thus, the "Milhouse is not a meme" meme was born.  Unfortunately, now *every* "meme" is born from a very intentional act.
Of course, the fact that quickmeme and similar sites exist (and monetize the whole thing) doesn't help.

I didn't ignore you dude, I went to bed.  It was 5am eight hours ago when you asked this.  You're kind of being an asshole.  OP gave away money which he did not have to do.  I am not OP nor have I ever met/talked to/interacted with him.  We both have long, separate histories on Reddit.  
You seem like a conspiracy nut, or maybe just butthurt and trying to justify your existence.  
As for the BBQ sauce, I'm surprised you've never heard of it.  If you like BBQ sauce, then you know what Sweet Baby's Ray's is.  It's kind of a huge brand.  Look it up.  I hyped it because it's fucking delicious and I was excited to get the answer right.
If OP was this enormous brand trying for an ad campaign, why would he only have $20 up for grabs, post in the middle of the night, have some spelling mistakes and lack of clarity in his post, etc...  If this was an ad campaign, it was a shitty one.  I imagine that if Sweet Baby Ray's wanted to capture the Bitcoin crowd's attention, all they would need to do is accept Bitcoin.  That's it.

"I'm curious as to how this thing you like works.  Couldn't this bad thing happen because of it?"
"NO FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING IDIOT, JESUS CHRIST YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN LIKE WHAT I LIKE YOU FUCKING RETARD I AM SUPERIOR TO YOU"
Yeah, that'll spread the wonder that is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-10 02:54:00
Regardless of who the fault lies with, the end result is the same: Bitcoins are a pain in the ass to get.  If Bitcoin interests some new people, they're not going to make the distinction as to which currency is making it hard to get Bitcoins.  They're just going to know that Bitcoins are hard to get.  That's a complete strawman argument.

I'm not saying that it's impossible to reach your conclusion.  I'm saying that you mostly pulled those numbers out of thin air.  I guess I don't buy, "it seems like it could work" as the magic step between here and there.

If only my dumb ass had taken this advice a while back.  Lost about half a Bitcoin because I left in in MtGox.  Luckily, all the rest was in my local wallet, but still... bummer.  I don't even know how they got it, and I tried to figure it out for days.  :/

I'm glad to hear of more people realizing the efficacy of PPCoin around here.  I can understand the average Bitcoin user's frustration with altcoins, as they are largely just slightly tweaked versions of Bitcoin.  PPCoin is by far the most different contender so far, and it's actually got some original thought behind it.  Of course, it is still based largely on Bitcoin's codebase (I mean come on, Satoshi knew what he was doing), but it has a few innovations that I can't help but wonder why Satoshi couldn't come up with or decided against.
**TL;DR**  You'll be hearing more and more about PPC.  Trust me.  :)

I GOT IT!  YES!  Now I have to wait for the goddamn blockchain to catch up so I can import the private key.  Is there a way to get the coins more quickly given the private key?
EDIT:  Got the coins out finally.  Blockchain.info was being a bit glitchy on me, but it's all good now.
Thanks so much, OP!  That was a lot of fun!  I look forward to all future scavenger hunts!  :D
**DOUBLE EDIT:**  Sorry, I forgot to include the answer!  The 'Xxxx Xxx' referred to "Baby Ray", which is a reference to the glorious [Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce]( the greatest BBQ sauce of all time.  As OP said, it is the PERFECT ingredient for a summer picnic.  I'm so pumped right now!  It's 4am here, I should probably go to bed.

Not really.  I didn't have all that much skin in the game.  I hardly think anyone can be called a fool when the name of the game is speculation.  You must be a pretty petty person to come back and berate me for selling when I did and coming out ahead.
You're saying that I'm a fool because I *guessed* incorrectly and you *guessed* correctly.  That's what speculation is.  I imagine your life is a little sad, and I think you know that.  Seek professional help.

You're right; I meant bad press.  Namely, bad press *which has a basis in reality*.  Wild conspiracy theories without evidence does nothing for me, but if there's reason to believe we're on a bubble at any given moment, I'd like to hear that side of the argument.  It's delusional and so very wrong to downvote well-reasoned arguments just because it doesn't flatter the colletive wishful thinking of the subreddit.

It's been long-established around here that we use whatever chart makes us feel better about ourselves.  Bitcoin's up?  Not a log chart in the bunch.  Bitcoin's down?  "YOU'RE JUST USING THE WRONG CHART!"
To answer your question, yes.  It makes much more sense to use a log chart for most purposes.

Jesus Christ!  I fucking love bitcoin, but I'm not stupid enough to upvote every goddamn thing that supports my wildest dreams.  It's harder and harder to find a balanced, level-headed, sober information, opinions, and predictions on bitcoin.  People who say that maybe bitcoin won't be worth a thousand dollars this week are consistently downvoted while "GOING TO ONE BILLION" is constantly upvoted.  Goddamn.

I don't disagree.  Perhaps I'm guilty of hyperbole, as there is good discussion here, but in terms of upvotes I feel that there is a very heavy bias.  I do think that Bitcoin has the potential to grow as you say, but it's not going to do it growing 20% per day.  Bubbles will pop, confidence will be shaken.  For the long-term, I'm optimistic, but short-term delusions really get an undue amount of upvotes.  Of course, this is all in my humble opinion.

I think PPCoin has done some fairly innovative things.  The proof-of-work/proof-of-concept alternative is definitely interesting, and it's low-power consumption, something which the other crypto-currencies seem not to have given much thought to.  I think it's got some "best of both worlds" potential, as well as some innovative design.  Even though it's currently tiny relative to the Bitcoin, I really think it's *massively* underrated and could really be something.
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:52:50
Great points!  :)
At first, I was looking into Novacoin with a little more interest than PPCoin, as I really do like the advantages of scrypt.  Something just feels so... wrong... about having to spend thousands of dollars on an ASIC just to keep a toe in the mining game.  However, the vulnerability to botnet-based 51% attacks is just too large a security issue for me to fully embrace it, even if it does solve that problem Litecoin suffers from.  
To some, the whole botnet-attack thing seems unlikely, and I'm sure it is, but us tech-minded people (as I'm sure you are) have seen many enormous botnets come and go over the years.  I'm sure there are at least a couple who could wreak havoc on some little alt-coins, and botnet owners have been known to do more for less.
Outside of the technical aspects, the real nail in the Novacoin coffin for me was the developer pre-mining a boatload of coins.  That's just blatant self-interest which completely rides against the spirit of this crazy thing we're all a part of.

Sure are!  BTC-e and VirCurEx are the best places to get them.  I generally buy BTC from MtGox, transfer them to one of these exchanges, and then trade for PPC.  Mining is pretty similar to Bitcoins mining, at least as far as the user is concerned.

@_date: 2013-03-26 05:21:09
I think it's more popular/pervasive than most people around here believe.  Not necessarily because of litecoin itself, but largely because I've seen many litecoin-related posts deleted from the subreddit.  I believe a lot of bitcoiners have very, *very* negative view of litecoin for no real reason (and no, "we were here first" isn't a real reason).
That being said, I'm no huge litecoin proponent.  I just don't hate it irrationally.

14 is early for the last month or so... But I don't think most people would call that early, by any means.  Early is like... less than a buck or two.  Maybe even five, being generous.  Truly early, to me, is the pennies they were once going for.
Anywho, 14 is a great price to get in at for the short time you've been following bitcoin.  To be honest, if I'd started when you did knowing what I know now, I SO would have liquidated at 47.  I would still liquidate now, if you haven't.  Have you read about the crash in 2011?  I was around then, and man oh man, was it a sight to see.
@_date: 2013-04-05 04:10:53
**REMEMBER**:  If you drop them a note, do not ask *if* they will be accepting Bitcoin.  Ask them *when* they will be accepting Bitcoin.  Your words have power, so use the right words.
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:40:22
Right, I'm not saying that it would crash to zero necessarily, just that if right now the price started plummeting, dropped ten dollars a minute, someone with a buy order at 50 might shit himself and cancel his buy order.  In the event of a crash, you can't necessarily rely on the buy walls that existed just prior to the crash. Then, once it crashed to a level where people were antsy to buy or where they felt the bottom had been reached, people would begin to buy again.
I don't understand why my original comment has been downvoted.  I guess any mention of a crash interrupts the circlejerk...
