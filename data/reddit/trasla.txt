There is no difference between sending a zero fee transaction with Bitcoin core or with any other wallet. And I don't think this priority policy is used by many miners any more - afaik they only prioritize by fee per size nowadays.
@_date: 2016-08-26 06:10:03
Disabling zero fee transactions is not a punishment. They are super unlikely to get confirmed no matter whether sent with a phone wallet or the core client - there is no difference. The reason for phone wallet developers to not allow zero fee transactions is to save their users from frustration. 
There are already a lot of support emails coming in asking why certain transactions didn't confirm after x minutes. If people get the opportunity to set fees to zero, a lot of people will do that without understanding what it means and then they will complain to support.

If you cannot have the website change the address, you dont have many options. But you could use some backend to deliver frsh receiving addresses, something like mycelium gear for example. If you use one xpub key per website, you still see the aggregated earnings of each site in one HD account each on your phone, but people who donate cannot easily see how much you got in total, who else donated to you, where you are spending those funds...
@_date: 2015-06-24 09:28:38
The number of keys in your HD account has nothing to do with some single keys you import or spend from. The account automatically generates a new receiving address everytime you receive coins, and a new internal change address whenever you send. The number of private keys displayed under that account really only shows how many keys for auto generated addresses are bundled in the account. 
If you used cold spending from the menu or just tapped the camera button and scanned the private key, there are no traces of your key left, in those cases, mycelium only loads the key into memory, creates the transaction, and forgets the key right after. 
You "deleted" the paper wallet? How do you delete paper? Do you want to  you destroyed each and every copy of it? 
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:53:16
Sure! If you want to give to a specific person, I guess messaging them or using changetip is the easiest. If you want to donate to the company donation address, there is a mycelium gear widget on the about page on the website: 
And yes, I know, the team selection there is horribly outdated, with Daniel and me missing and Jan Moller and Andreas Petersson no longer with mycelium, but the donation widget works :)
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:24:38
As far as I remember my wording is usually "public for inspection". 
Edit: I see with "you" you were likely not addressing me but the company. Its for sure not the companies intention to trick people into believing mycelium is open source, and I do not object to your request to change the wording. I do not even object to the common request to make it open source, but thats a different story :)
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:22:40
True, that's definitely your accomplishment. Sorry for being difficult to convince 😉
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:45:40
Yes, it can be. Banks tended to be among the most trustworthy. Telling people to solve the problems they have because the trusted one party with trusting another party is completely different to reducing the trust needed at all. I don't want to say these companies are not trustworthy but being able to hold a balance at a bitcoin exchange is not some advantage of bitcoin, you could and can park money at companies anyway. The ability to really truly hold and transact money yourself is the advantage of bitcoin.

We set rollout to 10% yesterday evening, and increased it to 20% today. So far, we got three different crashes, but they all seem not critical and for corner cases only, and so far I would be fine with just releasing fixes in a 2.4.1 soon. So if everything stays that calm, I guess I'll increase the rollout to 50% later today and then 100% tomorrow if everything is fine and we do not encounter any problems (which I do not deem likely).
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:06:36
You're welcome. If you have any questions or problems, let me know. It's always better to ask twice than to lose money. (And, if you want to try out how stuff works, there is a testnet wallet version of mycelium as well, where you can do everything without risking real money.)
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:48:14
But the bank can decrease the value of the fiat you hold by just printing more. Thats not possible with bitcoin (or, better, it happens in a completely predictable way, instead of being a banks decision).

Hey, I confused people when talking about coinbase transaction cause I was thinking about coin creation and they were thinking about the service ☺
@_date: 2015-06-12 04:41:07
If you do not have anything else but HD accounts in your wallet (those with the multiple key icon), you can swipe the app data, launch, select restore backup and enter the 12 words. If there are any other accounts, you need to make sure you have a backup first. Your PIN might be resettable. If you navigate to the menu and select "clear PIN", if there is a "forgot PIN" button, you can use it to reset the PIN. This takes one week.

Better than anyone, anyone I ever met. ☺
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:46:14
The reasoning is that if others create and distribute versions of the app which look like the original, we will have the work with support for broken stuff, will have the brand name damaged if people scam others or have poorly done versions, etc. That said, I, personally, would rather have it fully open as well, but the guy who pays for development wants to keep it under that license for now, and since he pays for the party, it is his right to decide.
@_date: 2015-06-15 08:16:19
No, that does not help, all HD accounts get derived from the same seed. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 12:31:27
The difference is, if on top of this hardfork + softfork, a majority of miners suddenly mines big blocks, it will just work, the money will be spendable and possible to exchange. (Because it would be like giving up the softfork and profit from the hardfork the services already followed). If there is no fork at all, if a majority of miners would start mining big blocks _right now_, the money would not work on all those payment processors etc, because they have not followed the hard fork yet.
@_date: 2015-06-09 08:12:23
Yes, that's one of the big points on the to do list - no clue when we will find the time for it...

I don't know how exactly it works in the US - and it's not that important for this argument, the fact that there is an authority that can decide to increase money supply is the important part. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:42:50
If you replace "keys" with "coins" and back up before you send, then its fine. Your "keys" are derived from the seed (12 words) so just putting them somewhere else does not solve the problem of them being compromised. But if you send the coins to somewhere else, then re-install and get a new seed, you can send the coins to a new account on the new seed and be fine. But make a backup before you send money there. Hardware and software can fail at any time, and you want to make sure you don't end up with the money sent to a broken phone and no backup. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 11:46:17
Sorry, we are just two guys with other tasks as well, we add features as fast as we can, and support for more NFC use cases is on the list... but I cannot give you an ETA for that, since there really is _a lot_ on that list...
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:42:13
Maybe it functions by a complex, open system of incentives, consensus, opt-in regulations and amazing stuff we can't even imagine yet. Maybe we are able to build something better than "some authority decides how you should live your life and than enforces that decision". 
Of course we do currently need taxes to finance important cornerstones of our societies, but it's not like we just crowd fund streets and schools. I am pretty sure most of tax money gets spend for stuff people don't like to see their money used for.

Cool, thanks! 1 USD @_date: 2015-06-17 23:06:54
I am not sure what you are referring to with "spv nodes". Mycelium currently runs three full nodes, in three different data centers, with a custom server component on top which creates an indexed database of transactions and balances to be able to serve data to connected mobile wallets pretty fast. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:16:21
Coinapult Locks - you will be able to lock the fiat value of an amount. So if you have 200 dollars worth of bitcoin, and you want to have 200 dollars worth of bitcoin in two month, instead of selling them and then buying them again later on your own, you just send them to a USD locked account and withdraw them again later. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:51:45
Somebody trying to regulate something and somebody controlling it is pretty different. If they want me to register in some list when using bitcoin, I can still chose not to obey. That does not work with bank accounts, you just do not get one if you do not give your ID. If they want to tax your money movement with bitcoin, they ask you to file stuff and pay, but you could still chose not to obey, and not to report. If they freeze your bank accounts or just print more money to make all the cash you hold worth less - that is direct control :)
@_date: 2015-06-30 08:22:43
If we did that, you could just restore your backup somewhere else - we cannot access or freeze your funds, like coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 13:41:50
Actually, the seeds are not incompatible, the way used to derive accounts from that seed is different. The 12 word stuff is BIP39, and using a hierarchy to derive new addresses is BIP32 which all follow. Mycelium follows BIP44 in addition, which defines a multi-account structure. This is compatible with Trezor, Multibit HD and Wallet32 for example.
@_date: 2015-06-09 11:44:28
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-06-09 08:11:16
No, not yet - but we use the same derivation path for bitid keys, so it's a good base we can build on in the future.

You need to wipe the app data and start it to create a new seed. To get your funds over, you have different options. If you can turn the seed word list into a QR code, you can scan it from the new wallet to send the funds over. You could also send all funds to any other wallet you use before switching and send them back after. Another option is to create a single key account, make a backup and make sure it works, then send the funds to it and import the account after switching or cold spend from it to get the money over. When wiping the app data make sure everything is backed up. All HD accounts are backed up by the master seed, all other accounts need a separate backup. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:54:46
When you received money to a mycelium wallet, you had to wait for the transaction to be included into a block (aka 1 confirmation) befor you could send it on. With the update, you will be able to send it on right away. You will see a warning, explaining that the success of your outgoing transaction depends on the success of the incoming one. This is helpful if you for example buy bitcoin and want to spend them right away, or you get coins and want to move them on into cold storage right away. Or you send some to a friend and want him to be able to pay his beer with it, without waiting for the next block first.
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:57:10
I closed it, because it is not something where the code differs from its intended status. The owner of the intellectual property currently wants it to be published under this license. Nothing to fix or change for us. The fact that your opinion about which license should be used differs from his is not an issue of the project. I agree that open source would be better, but the guy who pays for development gets to pick the license. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:34:07

Basically, its based on the assumption that big transactions moving old coins have a high probability to be legitimate uses, and that the network is interested in processing them even without fee. Whereas small and frequent transactions might be spam and considered not as relevant. But even though these priority rules are default, every miner is free to have different rules, and not include feeless transactions. It could very well happen that in the future those transactions will take longer or not get included, and maybe even the whole concept of high priority transactions based on coin age gets dropped.

So you are doing exactly what the people did who have this problem now: You trust someone else to hold your money. You just chose someone else to do it. They trsuted the bank to give them their money on demand. You trust a couple of private companies instead.
That strategy has nothing to do with bitcoin. You could as well tell them to move all money to paypal and be free of the banking system.

You cannot easily make a paper backup of special private keys, but when setting up Trezor, you get a wordlist backup (12, 18 or 24 words to write down). This backup can be used to recreate each and every private key Trezor will create for you.

Yes. When your transaction cannot be broadcasted right away, you get a choice. Either queue for later, or delete. When donating or sending money to friends you probably want to queue, when paying for beer in a bar, you might want to fall back to cash and not keep the transaction.

If you want to receive money to it or check it's balance, just keep it active. If you don't want to confuse it with other accounts, give it a good name, like "cold storage" for example.

No, unless you use some other app to scan the private key and have it send without transaction fee, which might cause the transaction to take days to confirm (maybe never) and your money is stuck in limbo. But the transaction fee is about 3 cents, so whatever else one can come up with probably uses up the same amount on electricity while researching and performing it.

You type in amounts manually? I don't, I scan the QR code, check the amount for correctness, and hit send. Also, when ordering Pizza, I just use an address / account not holding 100 times the price at all, making such big mistakes impossible. But I get your point - its fiddly to use at the moment. (Not just typing addresses or amounts, securing all your coins in the first place is a nightmare for everybody not specially tech-savy). But imho thats not a problem in the technology. Its just a matter of developing the right tools for users. Cause sending a mail on your console is also error prone, but starting thunderbird, typing a text and choosing the recipient from your contact list is easy. We still have a long way to go.
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:09:45
The bitcoin system itself does not require you to wait for any confirmation. Most wallets wait for one confirmation before they allow you to send it on. Some services might wait for more before they considere something paid.

The code is still changing a lot at the moment while we clean up, take care of issues found in testing, add some features... And the main point of having the code on github is to allow people to see we are not doing anything evil. For testnet, though, nothing is at risk, so there is not such a big incentive to compile the app yourself.

Get a Mycelium Entropy, print as many paper wallets as you like, do cold spending from them. Or get a Trezor. Or both. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 13:23:45
You can still use your encrypted single key paper wallets with the new version. If you want to have a two factor backup of the word list, thats possible though still a little cumbersome at the moment. When you have a fresh install of mycelium (or after wiping app data), you can choose import backup, and then get options to use a 12, 18 or 24 word list and an optional password. Either generate them somewhere else (some site, or a Trezor) or use the word list you backed up and just add a password of your choice. This will lead to a different seed, so if someone finds the wordlist, he cannot tell whether its just empty accounts because you never put money in there (or moved it all away), or whether you added some password.
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:43:30
If you want to use the bitcoin blockchain, yes, you need the tokens. But you could use the concept of a blockchain without bitcoin. Actually, a hell lot of people already did it - they created alternative crypto-currencies like litecoin, namecoin, dogecoin, blackcoin and hundreds of others. Those sometimes just clone how bitcoin works, but some also alter different things in the protocol. Sometimes its small changes, like total currency supply or block time, sometimes they completely change the way new coins are mined, how transactions are confirmed etc. So there are a lot of ways to use the underlying concept of a blockchain for specific purposes without using / liking bitcoin, which is merely the first implementation of this technology. You could, for example, state that you hate websites, but love the internet.

To put it simple, EC multiplied encrypted keys can be generated without knowing the passphrase and the private key. Thats is, you derive some information (EC point) from your passphrase, give it to somebody, and they generate new addresses for which they only know the encrypted key, and only you can decrypt it. For non-multiplied encrypted keys, one uses the private key and the passphrase to encrypt.

@_date: 2014-12-22 12:34:04
It already does. Empty block: 25 BTC. Not-empty block: 25BTC + transaction fees. The incentive for mining empty blocks (faster propagation time) will eventually go away through improvements in the client software, while the incentive to include transactions (the fee) will grow (because they will make up a bigger part of the reward over time).

No, it does not apply only to _the_bitid wallet software, it does apply to any wallet software implementing the capability to handle bitid. You may not want to use a dedicated login software for storing money, you might not want to use it at all, but the beauty of this is that its fairly easy for existing dedicated money handling wallets to implement the ability to log in without any risk for your money.
So, this is how it goes:
You use the Mycelium Wallet for your bitcoins. You can inspect the code, cause its public, and can make your own build from it, if you want to. And as addition to all the fancy bitcoin managing features, you get the ability to scan a bitid QR code, the wallet tells you which site wants you to log in, you press yes and you are logged in.
And its way way more convenient and safe then any other widely used system you would bother to use, like providing mail and some password.

Even if being upset is silly in some cases, it does not prevent people from being upset and silly, and it still does no good to the one they are upset about, even if there are plenty who think its silly.
Then again, what if you want to cancel your order, would you expect back the same amount you paid in btc?
And sure, its sad if they are not available for btc right now (unless you use one of the btc to fiat payment services) but they will be soon, anyway.

There are two ways of selling: Announcing that you want to sell at a certain price, or looking for someone who announced he wants to buy at a certain price. Using the first option, you might have to wait and maybe never sell at all. When you want money fast, you thus have to use the second option, that is: select a buyer. You select the one with the highest offer. After this guy bought your coins, he might have all the coins he wants and his offer is no longer valid, so the next person selling will choose the one with the next best offer, which is a little lower, etc...
@_date: 2014-08-01 10:13:13
Depends on why you do this. If its just an investment, one bank storage account (or better two, still, with a copy in the other) is probably fine. If you want someone to be able to get the money in case you die, a bank storage box can also be set up to be opened to the correct person. In that case, make sure its not encrypted with some password only you knew.
If you use BTC because your fear oppression or prosecution by state and banks, or cause you are heavily into criminal activities, money laundering, etc - you probably should not entrust a bank with your paper wallet.
In that case, I would probably hide a copy in my flat and at least one at friends or relatives, and in case I fear my place getting  searched, make very sure its encrypted.

But its easier to keep a printer strictly offline, then a regular pc, especially if you have to get bitaddress org onto a regular pc somehow (infected usb stick?) and then again for all the other ways to create paper wallet, you have to trust the pc in addition to the printer.

Making secure paper wallet insecure because you scan it with an infected computer, and then use an infected computer to store it on an infected usb device, is somewhat besides the point of going to great lengths to make a secure paper wallet in the first place.
AT least, if you don want to rely on the durability of paper, laminate it. Maybe buy a new micro sd card, take a picture with that digicam of yours you never plug to a computer directly on that card and put it along with the paper.

Can we please just get over trying to connect the price to news? Thats not how it works. Good news do not increase the price, people buying increase the price. Did you just buy 1000 BTC after you heard Microsoft now takes them? No? There you go, thats why the price did not increase. Do you think a lot people decided to buy a lot of coins cause some funky posts on reddit? While I get that it might seem like "good news" should encourage people to buy, buy and sell decisions simply follow way more complex rules, and the news might not be considered as big or as good or even get noticed outside of this enthusiastic melting pot subreddit.

Sure, if we are at that level... when someone is able and willing to burn down places to cause me trying to get physical access to my paper wallet split key shares, and then follow me to snatch them all off me, well...
I would have to decide. Online storage with good encryption says i don't need to get to any specific place. I have to rely on encryption (thats OK) and my ability to remember my password. Or to pass it on to those i want to access the money.
And then again, if somebody knows about my BTC holdings and is willing to brun places for it, they are probably also willing to kidnap, drug and hit me.

@_date: 2014-08-22 13:14:31
Well, if somebody gets your password, maybe because you told him, or some keylogger grabbed it, or whatever, it will work for all those paper wallets... so the answer ultimately depends on how confident you are your password is secure, and how easy access to your paper wallets is for someone who might know it :)

practically, no.
Of course there is the same theoretical possibilty of generating a key pair which has been generated by someone else as with any other bitcoin address generator, but its way more likely that our universe will get through to its death without that happening. The entropy used for randomness is way more than needed, you will get better results and safer wallets with this than with many other ways to generate bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2014-08-06 12:59:41
Initial 5 minutes? That means you are still waiting for the first confirmation, you dont have to.

Coins are not only broken up, but also merged. Transactions can also have more inputs than outputs.
@_date: 2014-11-08 11:18:14
No, it's  not "Bitcoin will be cheaper when it replaces the dollar" but "you will not loose money on currency conversion once you use Bitcoin both ways". If I buy Euro with USD and then buy something with those Euro, I also loose on the conversion. If I get paid with Euro and spend Euro I don't. So as soon as you start to receive (parts of) your salary in bitcoin, or sell goods or services for BTC, you will not have to use exchanges all the time...

Yes, these so called coinbase transactions, the reward for publishing a correct block, need 120 confirmations before you can spend the coins, which is 120 blocks found in a chain depending on your block. The time for that is approx 20 hours.

It's not in beta yet, actually it was kinda quickly done this week, and now I have a week of vacation, so I need to clean up code code once I am back early December. Yes, supporting QR code scan as well (you can already scan a "raw" bip38 key with mycelium) is a natural thing and will be easy to include. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:49:06
Thanks, my fault, fixed for the next release :)
@_date: 2014-12-12 11:35:11
Yes, I am Jan Dreske, one of the mycelium developers. Concerning the HD choices: We had a hell lot of discussions about what to enable etc. There is always a tricky balance to be found between ease of use, protecting inexperienced users from loosing money, and enabling useful stuff. You can still import single keys from elsewhere and use them. But we agreed that in general, HD is far superior to single address accounts, and we want it to be the default usage. And we removed the ability to generate single keys, because the are not covered by the new and easier word list backup, and many people will not understand it (even if you tell them - people tend to not read the warnings etc) and if someone has a backup not backing up all of his keys, thats bad. Its hard enough to get users to make backups in the first place. Concerning the aggregate mode, that naturally went away with introducing HD accounts, cause an HD account is kind of an aggregated view over several addresses, but we understand that there is a need for seeing the aggregated balance. So we added a line showing the total balance of all active accounts, that one is in beta together with a bunch of other features, and will be released this month. I also experimented a bit with custom aggregated accounts, but there is a lot of other, more important stuff on the list, so that needs to wait. I will message you a link to the latest pre 2.0 release apk, on the mycelium server, signed with the same key as the releases from playstore. You will need to uninstall any newer version, since you can not downgrade. If you do, make sure you have all keys backed up carefully.

After having restored the key, navigate to local trader, my info, tap "create" and select the same key again. Your local trader info should then get loaded again. Make sure you restored the private key, not only the address.

Your existing backups will still work to import your addresses and keys. All the keys and addresses you have in your phone will stay there on upgrade. They will be "Single Address Accounts" and continue to work. In addition, you will get an HD Account (and be able to create more, when you started using your first). You will need to make one backup (write down 12 words) which will be sufficient for all HD accounts you ever create. We advise people to migrate funds from their old accounts to HD accounts, but we dont force you, and you can explore new stuff at your own pace.
@_date: 2014-12-18 12:04:14
SPV fallback is a possible extension, allowing to select another server (like toshi) as well. But as always, there is a lot of stuff on the list, so I just cant tell you when we will get around to those topics.
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:34:49
Yeah, and make sure the computer has not been infected before it got offline, and make sure its still secure when you put it online again. I don't say you cannot get even more security when putting effort to it, but the possible problems are numerous and users with less experience concerning secure systems will probably make a lot of them.
With ME, you just make it easier and more secure for most of the people.

If it's an Android phone, download the Mycelium Wallet for testnet. It's the same one as the real wallet, but uses worthless test coins. You can hit "buy / sell Bitcoin" on the main screen to navigate to the integrated trading platform "local trader". On the testnet version, there is a bot called "virtual trader" who will 'sell' testnet coins for free to you. You can use them to send to yourself etc and try stuff. Let me know if there are any questions or problems.

If you are selling something, you wait till you can see the incoming transaction on your device. If you cannot, cause the customer has no connection, the customer should not queue the transaction, but pay cash instead. Unless, of course, you trust the customer to really broadcast the transaction later. He could, after queuing, wipe the app data on his phone, and you will never get paid. If you sell cars like that, you will get cheated. For a $1 beverage at a garden festival it might be fine to take the risk. Basically, seeing the customer having a not broadcasted transaction is like him putting the money into an envelope with your address on it. You dont know whether he will actually send it.
@_date: 2014-12-18 11:58:55

What people do is start a live session on an offline computer, then plug in the usb stick with bit address.org or something saved on it, then generate and print. If the usb was infected, it could have infected the pc and cause it to have the address generation use non random numbers or something.

I am not sure I get what you are asking for. You don't want to reuse the address and you don't want to get a new one either? The solution would be to just cold spend once in your lifetime :P Or are you asking to have the wallet generate new keys based on the one it scanned, and then on each subsequent scan automatically find out that there's money in the generated addresses, use that one, and generate new? Thats rather complicated and not standardized and then we'd rather just implement using PriX key seeds as rassah stated.

What exactly are you looking for? You could quite easily display an address and then check a couple of available APIs for incoming transactions with matching amounts, for example...

Because someone has to verify its really stolen. It might be quite hard to establish rules for that on their own, but since this check for actual theft vs somebody just stating its stolen cannot be automated, you either need to have a hell lot of work done for everybody operating a node, or you will have some centralized decision about that. Both not feasible.

Concerning the value, it does not matter at all. But as long as you keep the coins on circle (or Blockchain.info online wallet) you do not really possess them. What you have is the companies promise to send them to you upon request. So just ask yourself how sure you are they don't steal them, loose them, get hacked etc. Compare your confidence in circle with the amount in question, and with your confidence to secure your funds. When you want to send them elsewhere, choose "Send" from the circle top menu and enter the receiving address. If you use a Web wallet, make sure to have a strong password and two factor authentication enabled. If you use a desktop or smartphone wallet, make sure to make backups of your private keys.

You create a seed word list any way (with mycelium, for example) and then swipe data, import backup, choose with password and then pick any password you like. This will of course lead to another seed as the same wordlist without password. You could even leave some change or have some activity on the non password version, so thieves don't expect a passworded version to exist.

If the math (2048^12) does not calm you imagination about someone guessing it, just look at it like this: If you have a 12 character password, for each character, there are about 50 to 100 possibilities, depending on which special characters you allow. Our "12 character password" has 2000 possible characters to pick from. As long as you create it randomly, and not construct a word list by picking words you feel are easy to remember, its perfectly fine.

Its a mix of different aspects. First, many hacks are probably fraud by the company / site owner. When you find out there is a hell lot of money floating in your system, you can get tempted to pretend it has been stolen and just keep it for yourself. Then, there are the inside problems. Its not so easy to set up a bitcoin business without having some guys doing maintenance on your systems. Often, there was probably someone with way more knowledge about security then his boss getting away with the coins. (Maybe even the guy responsible for securing them.) And, yes, of course its as with any other system: Its not easy to secure stuff, and even if you are aware of good practice and do it right, there might be someone finding a new way to access secured systems, and take your coins before you can patch. Its getting better, though, cause the awareness about how to secure stuff grows, and the options for offline storage like hardware wallets and easy paper wallet printing get better and better. But there will always be somebody not putting enough thought into security.

I already encountered the problem when telling someone "that's a special case, cause that's a coinbase transaction" and they thought I was referring to the company, not to mining reward. It can be a problem when written in a forum as well, you never know who reads what you write and gets it wrong. I am also annoyed when people ask for help cause they have a problem with "blockchain" and you need to first ask whether they talk about syncing the core client or using a web wallet...

Well, its at least a factor to consider. When buying stuff with bitcoin, most of the times, you indirectly sell them, cause the merchant will immediately sell them. But the pricing is a quite compley thing, basically people buy and sell not only because of intended usage, but according to what they believe the price and/or utility of btc will be in the future. Maybe quite some people thought they will get rich soon, bought, did see its not working out right away, now sell :)

I guess, it kept going up for some time while it became more known and easier to obtain bitcoins. Now we are in a phase where its mainly becoming easier to spend them, so price keeps falling. I guess it will go up again, when it again gets easier to get coins (like more ATMs, more people getting paid in BTC). And I feel like our current development, of making it easier to spend, will in the long run create more incentives to get coins. As soon as I can pay with bitcoin in my local super-market, or can pay my rent with it, I will happily increase the percentage of my salary I get in bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-09-05 14:46:30
Yes. Passwords work as described in BIP39, so same way as Trezor. (that is: the salt for the pbkdf2 is 'mnemonic' + password, and the password can be empty.) 
@_date: 2014-12-12 13:09:08
We considered not generating a seed on update, but eventually decided to just do it and not have users to perform extra steps manually. If a user updated and has old single address accounts, the wallet constantly shows a warning and advises him to move the funds to his HD account. He also gets a warning that the accounts are not backed up, unless he verified to have a working backup earlier. The warning for legacy accounts with coins in them can be disabled if someone knows what he is doing and consciously decides that per legacy account. Ultimately, there is no "right" or "wrong", in the end, each decision we make will work better for some users and worse for others, and we have more than 50.000 of those, so its impossible to fit everyones expectations. But its good to get dedicated feedback like from you right now, it makes me understand better how people feel about the wallet :)

Well, for me it's way more likely to receive bitcoins without buying them with fiat than to receive Amazon stock, but the prospect may of course differ wildly between you and me. 
The good thing is, nobody forces you to use Bitcoin or even bother to waste time learning more about it if you don't see any benefit in it.

If a private key is on paper only, it does not matter whether it is encrypted or not, as long as nobody gets to see that paper. But even if you are very sure nobody gets your paper, the key came from someplace. In your case, the potential leaks are: You got a modified version of bitaddress.org which delivered a key known to attackers, or when generating and printing the key, some malicious software got hold of it and relayed it to attackers. Another possible weakness is once you spend the coins, since you will probably scan or import them into some device which could be infected by malware either stealing your private key or tricking you into sending to another address than intended. But BIP38 encrypted keys, while making your paper useless to anybody else, still have to come from somewhere, and if you generate and encrypt them on a pc they are just as vulnerable as unencrypted ones. Maybe slightly safer, since they are already encrypted when the printer (and its cache...?) sees them, and still encrypted when scanned. (But eventually have to be decrypted to sign.)

Short answer: "Waiting for confirmations" is not a thing required by protocol. Every wallet is free to handle this as the developers deem its best. Some have you wait for confirmations, most I guess allow spending your own change right away, some allow spending other zero confirmation outputs as well. The miners will of course only accept the second transaction if they also already know about the first one.

No, that's not possible. You cannot disallow anybody to own Bitcoin. But you could prevent them from stealing in the first place. Search for some keywords like "multi signature escrow" if you want to learn more. You can organize transactions in special ways, so that neither the buyer nor the seller can access money without consent from the other, for example. If you lock up money from both, nobody has an incentive to trick the other one, cause they both loose money if they don't agree on pay or refund. There are great possibilities, and to answer your question: yes, there will be upgrades. They happen all the time. Standards evolve, applications are built, services go live, awesome ideas float all over the place! 
@_date: 2014-12-12 12:06:15
No, you should not increase the amount, cause if you do, excess money will end up at the target address, not be used as fees. Usually, whatever bitcoin client you are using should be handling fee automatically, or maybe let you set a fee manually, in which case 0.0002 would be a very very safe choice. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 09:06:19
I disagree. No matter how small the tip, nobody should be offended. Its no work or hassle to handle it, and always a gesture of recognition or appreciation. Nobody should refrain from tipping cause he feels like 3 cents are too low.

Basically, people tend to say that a non-inflating currency will keep people from buying stuff, because their money will be worth more in the future, so they will keep it. Not spending money will then essentially harm the economy. In my humble opinion, this is a non-complete and short-sighted view. First, the possibility to buy two bananas in a year from the money I need to buy one now will not keep me from eating. Likewise, the possibility to buy a sportscar when I am too old to drive will not keep me from buying a smaller car now. Then, again, saving for later is not a bad thing in the first place, a lot of big troubles and state scale problems today came into existence because people were spending too much, not because they were carefully thinking about the expenses. There are also (to my knowledge) no long term data and experiments about deflationary currencies, because it just never happened over a long period of time before, so its basically a lot of speculation. All in all, its a good thing to take a look from different angles and listen to concerns, but I personally am not worried. If there is a problem, it will decrease usefulness of bitcoin, thus the price, and will automatically have countered the problem - the expectation of rising price.

You really think these cloud hashing services actually have the miners they say they run?
@_date: 2014-09-05 19:46:22
Imagine you have a function to turn a password into a bitcoin private key and address. Now you invent a nice password, and back it up, but you dont use it directly to generate a private key and address. Instead, you append the number '1' to it, then do it. Next time you need an address, append '2' and do it again, and so on. Its a little like that, just waaaay more sophisticated. So you just need the one password backup to restore your addresses, cause you can just go ahead and append all those numbers again in order to retrieve them.

Besides being able to pay my internet access, food delivery service etc. with it, thus doing kind of indirect conversion (using BTC to buy stuff you bought with fiat before) i would probably just do in person exchange.
Like using the mycelium local trader feature and meeting people buying BTC in the city. Start with smaller batches, find out how it works, and then sell big amounts to those you felt comfortable with or had a couple of successful transactions.
Besides preventing some company from fucking up big time with your money, you'll also have no exchanges, banks etc. save your personal details, report transfer amounts to someone etc. Just in case this could bother you.

Right now the optimization has been quite simple, really just avoiding to include dust.

Wallet32 on android should work, and importing in a trezor works as well. The source code for the mycelium app is on github, so even if we disappear toegther with the playstore version, you can still compile your own one. We will also work on providing a desktop program you could use to retrieve your keys in case the app breaks down. And other wallets will probably adopt the BIP32/BIP44/BIP39 as well. And in the very worst case, some programmer will make a recovery tool if everything else fails :)
@_date: 2014-11-03 13:26:40
Actually technically its misleading to say they seized the bitcoins. They need to get hold of the private keys. This could be either cause they are stored or written somewhere, unencrypted or with weak encryption, or the had keyloggers etc, they forced exchanges to reveal the keys, or forced or negotiated to obtain keys or encryption passwords from the guy. However, you are right - if well done, one could probably get away without having them access the coins, and probably even conceal how many there are. But you need some understanding and dedication to do it well, and the personal risk evaluation has to conclude that the effort is worth the benefit. And there needs to be a risk evaluation in the first place.

In the old Mycelium, you could have aggregated view turned on, to combine the balance of all addresses. However, in Mycelium HD, the HD accounts jump in to fill that gap. So in order to aggregate multiple addresses under one account, create an HD account. We turned your old addresses into single address accounts, so you still have your money around, but we encourage you to move your funds to a new HD account, to get away from address reuse :) The HD account will show you how many private keys it contains, and allow you to display which addresses currently hold which parts of the accounts total balance.

You can use the local trader feature in the mycelium app to buy bitcoin, and in the testnet version, there is a bot "called virtual trader" who "sells" testnet coins to you for free. you can then send some around and try stuff.

You do not sign transactions to authenticate with BitID.
You sign something like 
And the server does not tell you what address to use, you tell the server what you used. No way for someone to get a transaction off that way.

You can use any account to trade. Local trader will perform the trade based on the account you currently have selected in your accounts tab. Tying the trader identity to an account is not used for trade purposes, its use is to take that account to encrypt your chat when trading, so our servers cannot see what you and your trade partner are talking about, even if we wanted to.

You can spend 0 Conf stuff when doing cold spending. The problem is, non professionals will enable it if it's available, to make the wallet "receive faster", and when things get fucked up, they will blame us... But maybe we should talk about that topic again...

If you want to know the specifics, check out the BIP39 first, that's the standard for word lists. Basically, the pbkdf2 algorithm is used to turn your word list into your master seed. Then you could check BIP32 to learn how keys get derived from that seed, and BIP44 if you want to learn about the specific account structure used in mycelium (and others, like Trezor for example). If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!

Okay, let me correct my example. You don't like the world wide web, but you do like networks. Every other network is smaller and less powerful than the internet, but you like to have a LAN party. It works for your purpose, and you don't care for the people telling you that its not worth anything and a stupid copy cause you cannot access wikipedia and all the lolcats. So you cannot have the web without networks as you cannot have bitcoin without blockchain technology. But you can have networks without the web, the web is just the biggest, most prominent "application". And you can use blockchain technology without bitcoin. But all  this is just to explain that you can technically separate those two thingies. I guess what people usually express when they say they like blockchain technology but not bitcoin is the dislike for th community, views expressed in bitcoin related circles, price hypes, revolution claims etc. They want to honor the technology but keep a distance to the somewhat religious cult about its usage.

There is no way to put money "into" bitcoin, whenever someone buys bitcoin, someone else sells them. Billions could change their owner without the price changing, if everybody were to trade at the current price. A single dollar could be enough, if noone was to sell below 1 million dollars per coin.

Technically, he can. Your app does monitor all receiving and change addresses your account has created (as long as the account is active) so if someone repeatedly sends to the same address or does send back to the address it came from, you will receive the coins. But in general, it is a very very bad idea to do so. There are quite a lot of reasons. When sending back to an address, you make a couple of assumptions and have to rely on them being true. First of all, transactions might have multiple inputs from multiple addresses, so you need to decide which one you demm the "sender" address. When sending back to that one, you assume the address is actually controlled by the sender. It could as well be some service he initiated a payout from. You assume he still controls the private key, which he might not. You lessen your own privacy by making it obvious you did send back the coins, everybody can see this. You assume the receiver is okay with you lessening his privacy by reusing his address. The "source address" might be a multisignature address which can only be accessed with consent from multiple entities.... So, while we technically allow you do receive payments to used addresses, we do not at all encourage anyone to do so. :)

Right now, there is no way to delete it. We are still discussing how to handle this. The problem is that you would get the exact same account back when you created a new one after deleting the empty one. We are not sure how to avoid confusing users. Right now, the only (quite cumbersome) workaround for you would be to wipe your app data, and then importing your backup again. You will be default get only the first account recreated. (And would get the second one upon choosing New HD Account again).

I really have no clue about how the foundation spends money. I guess this is a self regulating thing, if enough skilled devs care for the core, it will just evolve, if we feel its not enough good devs working on it, monetary incentives have to be upped, whether some centralized payments like foundation, or just an increase in tipping on github or whatever.
@_date: 2014-07-29 15:25:08

All the use cases are possible with fiat. But not all are working as fast and smooth. Of course my ideology and enthusiasm play a big role. I code for the mycelium app, guess what - i love using it. But, for example: I never tipped anyone on the internet, though i would have liked to. Reading about something, feeling its worth to shoot them a dollar or two - and then what? Register with paypal or flattr or micropay...? Spend more time getting money to them than for earning it? No thanks, immediately dropped the thought. But now, when I read an article I liked, if it has a QR code, I donate 30 cents, saying "thank you" with money. When I read about the legal funds for some guys I where I feel they deserve help: Just give three dollars. Reading about how someone is trying to find and open source a cure for cancer? There we go. Its easy. I never did that before, cause setting up the systems is scary and cumbersome. Of course we can settle debts in the office with fiat, but when someone brings food to me from the supermarket, its easier to just scan a code and send the amount then checking whether I actually have fiat with me, whether we have enough coins for change etc. Its not easier for someone outside of bitcoin - but at least some things are easier once you are in.
@_date: 2014-10-09 15:41:16
The addresses get generated in order, and the usual lookahead is 20. So in a specific account based on your seed, you will get at maximum 20 unused addresses, which your devices monitores for incoming transactions (along with all the already used addresses). Some implementations just show one receiving address to you, and you get a new one once you received a transaction to it. Thus the wallet knows, which addresses have to be monitored.
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:01:57
It is an indicator better able to tell you about the actual usage then looking at the transaction volume. Because, for example, if i pay someone with one transaction, or pay them the same amount with multiple transactions, and then the coins go through multiple intermediaries or escorts or whatever, the transaction volume will be higher, the days destroyed stay the same. If someone sents money around automated, or exchanges fake transactions to make it seem like there is a higher trade volume, the transaction numbers will heavily increase, but its quite tough to manipulate the coin days destroyed, cause you would need to wait after every single transaction for the coins to age again...
@_date: 2014-09-23 13:26:43
Well, that really does heavily depend on what you want to accomplish. For some tasks you need servers, for some you don't... So before thinking about coding, one should actually find out _what_ to code :)
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:08:44
Yes it does. When cold spending, change is sent back to the paper wallet. When using an HD account, every time you receive money, you'll get a new receiving address, and every time you get change, there is a new change address. The app does monitor all old receiving addresses, so if someone sends money to you to the same address twice you'll be able to spend it nonetheless. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 15:30:26
Which version do you use?
Maybe you need to update. Naviagte to the transaction history tab, select a transaction and choose "label transaction" from the action bar menu :)
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:38:48

Nevertheless, "from address" is a dangerous misconception about how things work. It carries multiple assumptions which can be totally wrong. Using the term "from address" implies there is only one, it's controlled and accesible by the sender, it's not for one-time-use, it's really a simple address and not a script hash...

Well, if the Trezor gets stolen or lost, you can use the seed you stored in a safe place to just recreate your wallet with a new trezor (or with other software allowing you to derive the seed from it). That's the point in writing those words down and store them in the first place.
@_date: 2014-08-04 15:53:06
Yes there have been transactions which dropped from the mem pool after beeing not included for some time, and there have also been quite a lot transactions not being relayed by nodes at all because of them not including sufficient fees, to prevent spam transactions.
Transactions without might get included at some time, and it helps if the client re-broadcasts them, but you cant rely on it, and as more and more transactions are being made, there is more competition for the memory in blocks and thus low-fee or no-fee transactions will less and less likely be included.
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:43:25
And if you are fast in rolling them, and even faster in writing them down, and doing the hashing and key calculation, you might even get out more paper wallets then the ME, cause you dont need to be replugged between making two :)

Actually, it would be possible to have the app on an online device without private key prepare a transaction, have that transaction passed to and signed by an offline device, and return it signed to get it broadcast by the online device.

You know, if you really wanted to get more people to work on 'real solutions', did you consider _not_ calling bitcoin a ponzi scheme like every other guy who has no clue at all about it? And, besides, the transaction limit is artificial and can be changed if needed, and there are interesting discussions about how to do it best (smarter then just getting rid of the maximum block size). You could really use your time contributing to that discussion instead of telling us bitcoin can't compete with Visa.

What I'd do: Print out a paper wallet from bitaddress.org. Depending on your level of paranoia and the amount to be donated, you could increase security by taking the computer offline, or do funky stuff like reviewing the code before you print or burning the computer afterwards, but you will probably not give amounts justifying this :) I'd then import the priv key into mycelium on my phone (I am sure noone else gets easy access to that) or maybe store a copy somewhere, so in case the gift gets lost, you can recover the money. Then send some coins to that address, and ship it. Tell your friend to install mycelium, and use the scan button on the main screen to start cold-spending from that key he received, to send all the coins to hiw own account in mycelium. Tell him to back up his master seed by writing down the 12 word backup and storing it in a secure place.
@_date: 2014-10-13 11:24:08
Mycelium does not use BIP39 as a clumsy way to import accounts. Its purpose is to be a backup for all your HD accounts. A backup thats easy to make, cause you need just pen and paper and write down 12 words. And cause its nice we also offered the opportunity to import your trezor backup as well. Adding accounts from other seeds will be handled in a different way, cause its a different thing. The purpose of BIP39 in mycelium is to have a single simple backup for all HD accounts.
@_date: 2014-08-18 19:58:26
Whether online or offline, you don't need to register new addresses with the network. You just pick a random one, and since there are so unimaginable many ones, it is very safe to assume that you will never ever pick one already in use. You just need to tell someone if you want to receive money to it. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 11:17:46
Well, many people just don't only to what would be a 'good' decision. When you learn about bitcoin, you get excited, and you want to try it, and do something, and the most obvious thing to do for newcomers seems to be to try mining.
Thats how it was for me back then, also I totally did the math and knew I would loose money on mining, just buying seemed so damn boring to me. So I played around, and learned quite a lot back then. I also lost quite some money, but I am still sure it was a good investmen.
Cause at this very right moment, I am sitting here together with great developers, working on the Mycelium Wallet, and well, I am happy. And messing with GPUs was my red pill to bring me into this wonderful world, because otherwise I would not have learned about the technical aspects of bitcoin, and would have wasted my time trying to learn trend analyses and ponder over charts :)

Gold also has a deflationary supply. Do we all expect economy to grind to a halt because all the companies will just buy gold instead of investing money? They could expect gold to constantly gain a higher rpice, because there is a limited supply. Do companies tend to not invest in IT infrastructure, because they can expect it to be by far outdated a couple of years in the future, and they could buy greater faster cooler equipment with the same money in the future? Of course investments will have to compete with a potentially growing price of bitcoin. But is there anything specific which leads you to think the price will constantly grow in a rate outpacing potential earnings of other investments? If there was any certainty about a price grow, people would instantly buy, and within a short period of time the current price level would reflect the expected future value.

Trezor has an optional password. This "TREZOR" password in the test vectors gave me some hard time when making this import for Mycelium, cause I did not figure it out right away. Whereas mycelium just offers 12, 18 or 24 words and optional password upon import, and always uses 12 words, blank password upon creation, with trezor, you can choose between 12, 18 or 24 words upon creation and also set a password if you want.

You cannot send bitcoin to a fiat bank account. You can just send bitcoin to bitcoin addresses. What you tried is a bit like putting the address of a bakery into your online banking, and expect bread to fall out of your screen :) So if you want to exchange bitcoin for USD, for example, you need to buy USD from someone, paying with bitcoin. You could either meet someone on the street to do that (find people with localbitcoins.com or mycelium local trader) or use an online exchange. You could try setting up an account at circle.com or use any of many exchanges (btc-e.com, kraken, coinbase...) You send your bitcoins there (your account will show a bitcoin deposit address) and then trade them in for USD, euro, yuen, whatever you want. You can than withdraw that to your bank account or credit card. But note that this is not the primary purpose of bitcoin, exchanging it is still kind of a hassle. You could instead try to donate to wikipedia, settle debts with friends, order pizza online, shop at dell, newegg or overstock etc and pay directly with bitcoin, without exchanging it. If you buy something with bitcoin, the merchant will give you a bitcoin address where you have to send coins to, thats what will get accepted when you put it into the "withdraw" field :)

Yes, the Mycelium Wallet is compliant with BIP 32/39/44. So you can import a Trezor backup with or without password into our App. Upon import, we only re-create the first HD account, so if you had more accounts in Trezor, you need to select "Add HD Account" to access the other ones.

When I say "HD Account" I talk about one of the accounts derived from the master seed. Each seed has its own backup word list. But under that one seed, you can create multiple accounts (to logcally divide maybe business, private, mining etc). And each account will contain multiple private keys, cause it generates a new receiving address each time you receive funds, and a new change address each time you get change from sending.

The drop happened because obviously, more people are looking to sell than people are trying to buy. But is there really a point in asking people to present the same combination of self made market theories, ensuring future predictions and  jokes about the price five times a day?

Hehe, instead of checking the price, you check the combine total value of your hot wallet and cold savings?

Personally, I think playing around with testnet is a good opportunity to get a feeling for it without risking money. The greates advantage is probably to be able to instantly get money without any effort, by using the mycelium wallet as mentioned. Just install it on Android, go to "buy / sell bitcoin", and start a trade with "virtual trader". Thats our bot who will hand out testnet coins for free. You can then send money around to yourself, try to make a backup, wipe app data, restore backup etc without risking to lose money.

An algorithm calculates a checksum over some data. This checksum has to meet certain criteria, so the data is altered again and again, and the checksum is calculated again and again, until the criteria are met. The data and checksum then get published, and everybody verifies that the criteria are met. If so, all agree on asigning a higher balance to the one who found the correct data combination. Very very simply put.

If all your phone is holding are the addresses for the paper wallets, you don't need to make another backup, since you have them on paper already. As long as you make sure those paper wallets are safe (maybe put a copy into your fire-proof safe-box), you can always restore the watch-only addresses on your phone by scanning them from paper.

No, not right now. But we consider adding support for something like toshi or along the lines, so you can switch the server to something you or someone else runs. But actually, there are a lot of things to do on the list, so I cannot tell you when we will get around to code it.

Cons: People have to educate themselves and take a lot of responsibility, and because many are not aware of pitfalls etc, its more likely for them to loose money. Pros: Its damn easy to send money around, fast. I can donate to projects, tip people, get paid, order stuff etc worldwide and fast without setting up stupid accounts all the time. There are also a lot of cool things you can do on top of that network, like proof of existence etc. And finally, depending on where you stand its either pro or con: You can do things the government and banks dont want you to. That could either be not paying taxes, or not having a government freeze your account because you follow a certain religion. You can buy weed where its not legal, you can buy a bible where its not legal.

Oh, and I donated to several institutions. I also hold some to get rich etc.

Though confirmations make it harder, it's already pretty damn hard to double spend without the receiver recognizing the attempt, so accepting 0 confirmation transactions is quite save and usually done by most merchants in my experience.

Depends on what you expect when you say "support Trezor" :) You will be able to import a Trezor wordlist in Mycelium in case you lost your Trezor device. Plugging your Trezor into the phone to have it sign transactions, though, is not that easy to accomplish, and still subject to internal discussion, so I cannot tell you whether (and if, when) that will be available.
@_date: 2014-11-22 18:38:39
Through transaction malleability, a mutated version of the not confirmed transaction could get into a block, thus invalidating the transaction sent based on it, cause the parent transaction hash would be different, and it would never confirm. And, less likely but possible, intentional and unintentional double spends could also invalidate transactions based on other unconfirmed transactions.

Well, there are risks. If it's possible, people will use it just cause it's faster, and if something goes wrong, people will get confused, or not recognize an outgoing transaction was invalid etc. I see your point, though. Why do you think cold spending is a special case in this regard?

Well, to put it short, you could generate a key pair for somebody else without knowing the private key to the address yourself, but you would then still need to transfer money to the address. 
So as far as I see it, there is no way for trustless transfer of private keys to avoid having transactions on the blockchain.

Yeah, but if the state cant buy anything with the legal tender, cause nobody wants it, cause all they can do with it is pay taxes,... it will be like, you sell some btc for dollars, pay your taxes, and the state has to convert the dollars back again to btc, cause you cant buy stuff with dollars. Even if they require state employees to accept dollars, they will convert them back in an instant.

@_date: 2014-08-04 15:43:11
Yes, the fee is optional, actually implicit.
The fee is the difference between total amount of inputs and total amount of outputs, so all the money going into a transaction which does not go out again is the fee.
If you dont set a fee, tough, it might happen your transaction just will not get included in any block and thus never get confirmed, because there is no financial incentive for a miner to include your transaction, since it yields no fee for him.
@_date: 2014-09-03 07:06:03
Address books become less important with HD Wallets coming up, but apparently some people use them. Will maybe get replaced by some better mechanism in the future. As for labeling transactions, I implemented that for the HD, so you will get the feature once we release HD.

You absolutely can send each of your friends a transaction right one after another. Money coming from the same account, including change, can be spent without confirmations, since we know where it comes from and that nobody tried to do anything weird with it. I am not sure whether immediately sending money coming from an external source is something really needed, but we could of course discuss this topic again and look at the pros and cons...

And who cares? If the price keeps getting down, and even if it stays down, bitcoin will still work, and the technology will still be useful as hell. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:19:42
You can do it without a PayPal account, if you choose credit card without login. It's a little unfortunate concerning the payment options. There are two main reasons for not directly accepting bitcoins right away. Indiegogo does not offer direct bitcoin payment, but an organized way to do such a campaign. Keeping track of everything, publishing status, getting people to trust the published status, arguing about whether something can or should be refunded...  is a hell lot of work, and there is other stuff to do. 
And even the slightest notion of hardware "pre orders" for bitcoin can turn into a marketing nightmare. Thank you BFL. If money is kept in BTC, the price could crash and manufacturing can't be paid. If money gets converted to fiat and the funding goal is not met, people want their BTC back, even if the price is higher, and rebuying them has to be done at a loss. 
It's sad, but there are two many pitfalls to distract people from actually working on stuff. Selling for BTC will be done eventually, and it will be more convenient and less risky than trying to fund it on BTC. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 10:41:59

Actually, its not. The main reasons: I can donate to a lot of sites / people without setting up any stupid account. I can pay people without personal contact, fast. I can pay people exact amounts without having to hassle with change coins in my physical wallet. I can maintain a perfect, annotated history of my spendings on my phone. If I run out of money in a bar I can call friends in other countries and they send me more within minutes. Of course, traditional payment methods work great, at least most of the time. Besides paypal fucking up stuff. And problems with the timings of bouncing money back and forth between my bank accounts in different countries. But bitcoin is already slightly more convenient for many things (buy stuff from people without sharing bank account details and delays due to transfer times) and way better for some (online purchases and tipping and donations without registering with yet another payment processors) but of course I also want to encourage people to use and accept bitcoin.  Cause I see a bright future for it. :)

Old receiving addresses are monitored for incoming transactions. Change addresses are not. Thats because the app expects to be the only one sending change to its change addresses. If for any reason you need a full blown account discovery, you can archive and then reactivate the account. But you should communicate to whoever just sent money to your change address that "sending money back" is in general a very very bad idea, for a whole lot of reasons,

I just got my Bachelor of Science degree this year. I am excited about bitcoin. I figured I'd rather have a job which I am interested in, and try to contribute to something I feel is important, than to have a "traditional career" and ever regret to not having tried.

"Cutting of a large pool" is a misleading concept. If a pool operator gets cut off, everybody on that pool who is outside Russia will just move to another pool. So no matter how pools are distributed, in each case you will just cut off the mining equipment physically located within Russia. But decreasing overall hashrate together with maybe some miners flogging to another pool could of course considerably increase another pools network percentage.

I would rather not tell them to use a specific wallet, but maybe send them to  which I feel is great.

Well, there is no underlying value in dollars as well (or maybe not "as well", cause there is some intrinsic value in bitcoisn - they are, for example, a way to store data in a distributed global database). The USD has value, cause people expect to be able to trade their dollars for goods or services in the future. Same goes for bitcoin. So the question is: Do we have more trust that we will be able to exchange dollars for food int the future, or to achange bitcoins for food? The dollar has as pro that it is well established, but then again, it has quite some history of government and banks fucking around, like printing more and thus lowering the value of what you have. Also, banks can freeze your acounts etc. Bitcoin has as pro: its way more easy to send and divide, and the underlying rules are public, so you can _understand_ how it works and whats possible, instead of having to trust your banks and government and credit card companies etc that they get it right and dont betray you. With bitcoins, there is no way to just decide to print more and cause inflation, or to freeze peoples accounts or stuff like that. What makes bitcoin better than sands, rocks, and orange juice: you can send bitcoins worldwid, fast. You can make backups to guard the access to your funds. You can divide them better. They are scarce, in a perfectly predictable way, so nobody can just stumple upon a new beach and thus devalue all other sand in circulation.

First, "the best place" indicates its only one paper. Of course you should have a split private key, and store the parts at different places.
With a 3 of 5 split key I would distribute like this:
    1 My bank storage box in Germany
    2 My bank storage box in Austria
    3 At home
    4 In my parent's safe
    5 I don't tell you
Even if banks would collaborate or be required to open the boxes by law, they would fall 1 share short of accessing my funds. And three different places burning down or getting robbed in close succesion without me noticing and moving the funds first is unlikely enough.
Depends, of course, on the value, but with split keys its always possible to go to greater lengths to secure it, with 4 of 7 split keys I could as well bury one in a fake grave and post another one on reddit.

Well, like with any currency, you can buy it (exchange other currency for it), or sell stuff for it, or offer services for it. On bitcointalk.org there is not only a lot of interesting discussion going on, but also a forum marketplace to offer goods and services. Then there is for example. Mining is only interesting for experimental reasons, as a hobby or to understand how bitcoin works, there is no way you will make money on it without a large scale operation. I would be okay with getting the coins back in a month as well :)
@_date: 2014-08-05 12:49:45
The good thing is, you do not paste anything anywhere and sign it.
The callback URL is part of the signing challenge. What your wallet app does is display which site you are going to log into. If you want to log into BitcoinCasino and your wallet asks you to log into BitPay, well, you know whats up.
And your wallet can take care of deriving the key used for that based on your priv key _and_ the website, so any two different websites will always get logged into with different addresses, but all these identities are linked to the same priv key you hold.
No need to set up or remember anything.
And by deriving the login address from hashing your priv key with the website, well, you make sure not to have funds on the resulting address and even if there was some way to get you sign a transaction, there would be no money to steal.

Yes, when ever you receive money with an HD account , mycelium will create a new receiving address in the account, and whenever you send, it will create a new change address. The limit for watch only addresses and single key accounts has been removed. Mycelium sticks to BIP  32/39/44 so you can restore the backup in any client supporting those standards, for example Trezor or wallet32.

I, personally, use the mycelium app on a not rooted android phone. There is a cold spending feature. :) Whenever you get your private key into any system, you expose it to some risks. For sending from paper wallets, these are smaller. If you want even more security and dont trust yourself to really secure a desktop or smartphone, you could get a Trezor.
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:07:18
Depends on whether there is a specific knowledge goal you are aiming for, or just general understanding. A good entry point is always to read questions on reddit or bitcointalk.org and try to answer them. If you cant, research in bitcoin wiki, the BIPs, other posts... and of course ask for details if you cannot figure something out. Also, most relevant software is open source, have a look if you can read source code!

If you want to see it really works, and dont want to tinker around with real money, you can install the mycelium testnet app from the play store. You can get worthless testnet coins for free when you open local trader (the buy/sell button) and 'buy' coins from virtual trader. Thats a bot who gives coins out for free. Then go ahead and fill two or more HD accounts with them, make a backup, wipe app data, start and import. You will get Account 1 back right again (give it some time for synchronization) and when you then add another HD account, you will get the same Account 2 you had before :)
@_date: 2014-08-16 10:26:09
Agree. Thats why we should either distribute the money over several keys in the first place, and when needed use a key with approx the appropriate amount of money, or whenever doing cold spending on big amounts, swipe the whole key and send the change to another (new) paper wallet.
@_date: 2015-05-27 10:43:36

Yeah, if you tell me the trader nickname I can tell you which address it is tied to. You can then check your backups for the key for that specific address. If you prefer you can also mail a request to developers and ask for the associated address for your trader identity.

Just apply all the good practices. Meet in public places, if you want to be extra secure somewhere with video surveillance, etc. Dont trade very big amounts before establishing trust with smaller transactions, etc.

No. It is not important, how many nodes try to manipulate, but which ones. If i set up 20.000 nodes with maipulated stuff, who cares? If i issue transactions, blocks, whatever not compatible with the current protocol and blockchain state, other nodes will ignore it. You could then either be on the fork with my 20k nodes, or on the fork with all the exchanges, merchants, regular users... 
Then again, if some few but important nodes were to change something, like lets say payment processors, mining pools, merchants etc., the decision whether to stick with the regular protocol and not being able to use those nodes, or to switch to their version would not be that easy.

@_date: 2015-05-27 20:44:06
Yes, that's true. And it's difficult, because we as developers naturally have a very good understanding of Bitcoin in general and our app specifically. Our beta testers are probably way above average knowledge about how stuff works as well. So we only find out what people get wrong by reading through forums and some support mails. 
And sometimes there ist just nothing well can do, people tend to not read warnings, or read and dismiss them no matter how big and read they are. And if we would block usage of the app before a backup was made, for example, I am sure it would not lead to more people making backups (and keeping them in safe places) but some backups on tissues or bar tables, and a lot of people using some other wallet and not banking that up either. And ultimately, we don't want to force people to make a backup, if they have three dollars of pocket change in there that's fine. But many don't make a conscious choice, don't read explanations and popup dialogs, and don't invest 5 minutes in good thinking. They re-install the app without backup to "fix some problems" or their kids delete app data to make room for games - and of course there were some hundred dollars in there. It's tough to get the balance with these warnings. So any input is very welcome!

@_date: 2014-12-19 12:53:08
When there are no more block rewards, the transaction volume will probably have increased by some orders of magnitude, essentially lowering the cost per transaction drastically. Also, miners cannot force people to pay higher fees, they could just not include transactions with fees they deem too low. But they risk that someone else includes the transaction and collects the fee, whether high or not. So there will probably a fee level established from competition for priority in getting a transaction confirmed.
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:29:18
You could just have upgraded your version, no need to uninstall the previous version. On fresh install, after you created a seed, you can use "backup" from the menu to get your word list. Once you have funds in your first HD account, the wallet will also tell you to make a backup. Once you have a verified backup, you can and should set a pin. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:45:22
Thats where the split keys are for.

No. The word list is actually not the seed, the seed gets derived from word list plus password, so the same word list with different passwords results in completely different master seeds with no connection to each other whatsoever. The only cross-vulnerability is that someone who knows your word list can of course try to guess different passwords or try to brute force them.

We received the missing 200 units from the factory, but a hell lot of them are faulty, so our hardware guy has to manually fix them.

Yes. That would be an encrypted xPriv key, the root of an HD account. Cold spending from that one would take longer, since the app would have to discover used addresses after scanning. But it's a good use case. It might take some time though, there are so many things to do on the list...

Ah, sorry, got that wrong. No, the wallet does not yet. But many merchants use a mixed style bitcoin uri (as in BIP72) to transport both, a bip70 payment url and flat address and amount and label, and in that case we read the directly embedded data, so it works - just not as sophisticated as it will once we support bip70.

Yes, BIP39 word lists can go along with a password. The actual seed is calculated using PBKDF2 algorithm on the word list, and uses "mnemonic" plus the optional password as a salt.

Yes, 120 confirmations for coinbase transactions. Yes, usually miners reject a second transaction with conflicting inputs. Yes, in principle a miner could choose which transaction of two conflicting ones to include, and could decide to take the one with higher fee, I don't know if anybody does so, though. Wallets can save both keys, but deriving public from private one is a quick, inexpensiv action.

This will not cause that many people to buy bitcoins right away, though, but it seems to cause a lot of people who are holding bitcoin to spend them on products and services. The merchants who accept them usually immediately sell them, so the good news about merchant adoption usually cause a lot of people to indirectly selling bitcoins, thus lowering the price short term.

I don't know electrum but can imagine two different scenarios. Did you create single keys / addresses? If so, and if electrum used another (new) key as change address, the other installation has probably no way to know about that change address and cannot display its balance and transactions. If you created HD accounts (or wallets or whatever it is called in electrum) you probably exported an xpub key in order to get the watchonly address. An xpub key can either be at the account root level and include the chain of internal and external addresses (that would be full watch) or for example only be for the external chain, and thus just reveal receive addresses but not change (internal) addresses - which is useful for billing etc. You might have exported the wrong type of xpub key for your purpose. But as I said, I never used electrum, so I might be totally wrong. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 18:07:34

It could (like make a new transaction to a new address, and send the transaction and priv key) , but there is no point in it. The watch can as well just create a transaction and send it to the POS. New address creation etc is fine - just depends on the spec of your watch, if it happens to be similar to a smartphone there is no problem at all.

Yeah, but if you care for 5 minutes worth of security through spent computation time, then you have to wait 5 minutes. If you feel like its frickin damn hard to double spend something after the transaction has been broadcast already, then do not wait. Where is the problem?
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:43:29
Mining effort and cost does not depend on transaction volume. And another possibility is that mining equipment gets more efficient, thus reducing the cost, thus reducing the needed income. And of course it's possible that miners will earn less in the future. But yes, you basically stated the options, and imho the transaction volume going way up is by far the most likely one. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 14:07:44
The 21 million is not a number set somewhere. Rather, the rules for generating new bitcoins (reward per block, being halved every 210.000 blocks) dictate that we will actually never reach 21 million. If you were to change these rules for generating coins, the blocks you generate will be rejected by the other nodes in the network - because they are invalid by their rules. So if someone wanted to change these rules, he would need to get a very big number of users to follow him, and at the moment, consensus is these rules should not be changed.

It grew more complicated for us (the Android devs) as well. Before our owner decided to get an iOS version as well, it was easy: Every mycelium problem was my problem. Now I always need to figure out whether someone on reddit or some support mail is talking about Android or iOS, and whenever its iOS I just can forward the message and not help myself. I still need to get accustomed to the fact that not all mycelium wallet talk is about my baby now :)
@_date: 2014-10-11 11:14:20
I don't have one at hand right now, and my phone is near empty. If you don't find something, you could have mycelium generate a list instead of importing one, then whipe app data again, and use that list with a custom password. You could also check bip39 for explanations on how to turn raw entropy into a word list. And I am pretty sure I saw some site generating those, but don't know what it's secure and can't remember where. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 15:33:06
Well, it really depends.
Most probably, I would not reply at all, cause I don't want to waste my time on somebody who is not interested in learning or argument, and obviously does not even care enough to inform himself. If, for some very odd reason, I really wanted / needed to tell them why they are wrong, maybe start like this: To the first guy, he come up with the "backed by nothing" argument. Depending on how you like to take it, either tell him that "being backed" is not a needed feature, just like gold is not backed by anything. BTC have utility, they allow you to store information irreversible in a huge public decentralized database. You could also tell him, that BTC are actually backed by a great variety of goods and services, they can be redeemed for food, electronics, custom porn,... The second guy tells you its a Ponzi scheme. Well, the definition of that is a number of people who share a secret about their plan, and collect money through promising rewards. Well, bitcoin is completely open and public, it is perfectly known and everybody can check whats going on, no secret investment strategy people are told to believe in. The perfect informations about the system alone is a fact that shows it cannot be a Ponzi scheme.

To answer the question whether "a lot of us" use mycelium, there are a little over 45k 'active' installations through play store (over 75k 'total'), plus unknown amount of sideloaded or self-built installations, plus all the installations through asian app stores I have no data for.

I talked to the branch manager of my German bank (Sparkasse Hannover - I still have the accounts though I do not live in Germany any more). He basically told me there are different possibilities why they would block transactions. First is they get embargo lists for countries and companies where money should not be sent to, and they are by law required to block those. This could include bitcoin companies if there are ongoing investigations because they are lacking money transamitting licenses which they need or something like this. This embargo list does not care about the topic of the transaction, just the receiver. Next thing is if they find signs of illegal activity. So they could block transactions where they suspect fraud or financing crimes. Next thing is violation of their terms for usage, like if your private bank account is showing operational patterns which indicate you are running a business on it, because they would then require you to open a corporate account. And the last thing is that they are free to choose whom they want to build a business relationship with. He told me that for example if PEGIDA, an association which is demonstrating against the "islamization" of Germany, wanted to open an account with them, they would refuse, because they are not compatible with the ethical principals of the bank. This would be blocking customers completely, not on a transaction basis. He clearly stated that at least the Sparkasse Hannover has no internal anti-bitcoin stance, and he even joked about how it might be possible to buy your coins there in a couple of years. They might be required to block transactions to certain bitcoin companies by law, though, and certain transactions could trigger their anti-fraud system. In his opinion, blocking a transaction "because its about bitcoin" is a very weird and probably too wide usage of this anti-fraud mechanism, when some banks figure that bitcoin is weird and insecure and whatnot and everybody needs to be protected because its all fishy scam.

Its awesome. But suffering a bit from a circular problem - the incentive to implement it is low as long as few services use it, the incentive for services to use it is low because there are very few client implementations.
@_date: 2014-10-30 15:02:55
There is a problem in your question: fiat money does not go "into" the bitcoin system. Every time someone buys, someone else sells for the same value.
And there is really no way to tell how much money has been spent to buy bitcoin. Because each transaction could potentially being someone buying coins. You cant tell whether I swapped coins between different addresses or sold em to my friend.
And even if you knew, what would it tell you? I could buy a coin from my friend, then he'd buy it from me for the same price, then I buy it again... and all the time your count of "money spent" would increase, without anything important happening at all.
@_date: 2014-12-15 13:33:18
Having very small outputs does not make it more likely the transaction will be accepted without fees, its instead less likely.

What do you mean with corrupted word bank? As long as the words are randomly chosen and come from a large enough set, it's safe. Humans are really really bad at getting a feeling for big numbers and low probabilities. Yes, 12 random words from a pool of 2000 are secure as hell. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:39:49
Hmm, if it's watch only, no money is at risk as far as mycelium is concerned, because you generated and stored the key elsewhere. We will warn you if you try to send money to one of your watch only addresses, cause you will only be able to spend it again if you still have the key somewhere else. Thanks a lot for your feedback, I will put these warnings onto the list of topics for our next big user interface reworks.

If you import a seed backup, accounts don't go away, as long as wherever you import it into supports bip44. You can still create old fashioned backups of single keys, it's the last point in the settings (shows only if you actually have single key accounts)

Thanks for your kind words. It's not yet finished, but we will add a dialog to ask you whether you want to discard a transaction or queue it for later in case it could not be broadcasted tight away. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:49:11
Well, there will just be open competition. Fees will get higher if they are needed to get your transaction through, not if miners demand it. So as long as someone is willing to do mining and collect the low fee, it will work. And if someone does, mining might become a little less profitable for some miners, and when they leave, everybody else gets a little more profitable. Also, the transaction volume might have increased a lot, decreasing the per transaction costs needed to provide incentive, since the amount of transactions going into a block has probably increased by then. And then again I expect a lot of changes during the next 100 years.

Every key is generated randomly and thus has in theory a chance to be a duplicate. That chance is so damn low, it's practically zero. You could use all the world's computers to just create new keys and it would still be very unlikely to get a duplicate before our sun burns out. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:22:52
I talked to them today as well and basically got the same answer. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:23:49
Well, the same way you do not accept non-payment or payment of half the amount. Just don't treat it as valid payment. Don't give out the goods, don't let the customer leave the shop, whatever. Most wallets people use will have standard fees and probably even not allow people to send without fee. If you clearly state that you require the customer to not send it without fee, or he will have to wait for a confirmation otherwise, you should be fine.

No, coins are not lost. The bug is just in recognizing them and allowing to send, once its fixed, you can send them. If you need to access them before a fix is rolled out, you can import the word list backup in mycelium on Android, Trezor, wallet32,... and access the coins.
@_date: 2017-02-16 07:33:04
There are various reasons for doing it, and the best two are probably that their bank will shut down their fiat accounts if they don't, and that regulators will shut down their business if they don't.

We are sorry for the inconvenience, just showing nothing if the exchange source is down is not really a good idea. We will fix that to show a warning and use the last known price or average or something. And it should tell you to change the source, of course. :)

Afaik electrum is going to be bip39 compatible in a future release. Right now, you could import that seed in Trezor or wallet32 on Android, for example. We also have "providing a desktop tool to extract private keys from wordlist backups" on our todo list, but atm other things have higher priority. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:47:18
Okay, might have happened, but note that in order to accept the backup as being done, the app let's you walk through the 12 words and then asks you to enter them afterwards to make sure you got them right - so it's not just something you can easily jump over without noticing.

The first five are written by us. If the zxing stuff would have used the Microsoft license, we would have spent a bit more time coding the QR code scanning. We just use parts of that lib and modified it anyway, so the difference isn't that big. But I still get your point, we are internally discussing options to truly open source it. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 10:30:03
Yes, the last word is a checksum. But thats just to prevent human errors, the system would work exactly the same without. Actually, when implementing this BIP in mycelium, I did it without checking the checksum for quite some time, because it was easier for testing to just make up word lists with incorrect checksum on the go. So actually its a list of 11 random words and one not-random one, but this does not change a lot.
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:54:28
Are you sure it uses the same address again? It should generate a new receiving address for the account whenever you receive coins. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:46:44
I just created my Kryptotag (trasla) and was facing the question which bitcoin address to use. Single addresses is something I'd mainly use for long term cold storage. So although this of course would add a hell lot more of complexity, a nice thing to try and get working for the long term would be to use a kryptotag as identifier for not a single address but an xpub key from a HD wallet account, so every transaction to a tag will actually use a new bitcoin address. Just what came to my mind, anyway its a nice service!
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:27:49
Yes, rassah is our community manager. Don't worry, your coins are not at risk. If you need to access funds very fast, you could import the backup in another wallet which supports BIP32/39/44. But the problem is being solved now, I hope it'll work again soon.

@_date: 2015-01-22 11:43:28
The problem is: when using a computer, you already have a lot of funky ways to fail securing your coins. When that computer has the physical possibility to be online, the number of ways drastically increase. Its tough enough if you know the system and possibilities well, and impossible if you don't, to be safe. The use cases are afaik corner case enough to not be important. You want to invest a lot of time setting stuff up to be secure, but its not worth to spend the money for a trezor or mycelium entropy to be even more secure and safe the time? I dont know what amount of money would be too much to hold on a smartphone but too few coins to justify buying trezor or a printer for paper wallets.
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:16:53
That's good. We could use the same derivation for mycelium then! 
@_date: 2015-01-30 09:05:14
We as developers are fine with the idea, just need to figure something out together with the one who pays for the show. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:46:30
There are two things to consider. First, to answer the last question: if the private key is out there, it is trivial to discover the address for it. The way from private key to public key to address is done all the time. The first big aspect is the question whether the private key is still save. If you used the cold spending function of mycelium (scanning the private key from paper - then making one transaction) it has only been in the phones RAM shortly and been erased right afterwards. If you imported the thing as an account, then created the transaction, then deleted the account, the key has been stored in a database (in protected memory) on the phone. The second case opens up a few more attack vectors. Both things are quite secure, though, and as long as your phone is not rooted or full of shady apps, things should be fine. You have to evaluate the risk by yourself, personally, I would not worry about it with a couple hundred dollars, but be extra sure and make a new one for my life savings. (I created some paper wallets and SSS split keys in advance, so i have untouched ones in my safety deposit box with the addresses imported and ready to use, to not go through all the hoops of creating new ones whenever i need one. Then again, I have also access to mycelium Entropy devices and can create new ones really fast and easy.) Most people would not consider it "cold storage" or even proper "paper wallet" anymore if the key was ever briefly stored in any online device. Its up to you to evaluate the risk. Its a completely different thing if you scanned the key with some other app and got it into mycelium using the clipboard - that is insecure as hell, since every app on your phone can read the clipboard all the time. If you did that, definitely get a new one. The second topic of the questions is the fact that the public key has been exposed as you made the first transaction. This is not exactly an issue yet, but if certain things about the crypto were discovered to be broken or more easily cracked than expected, addresses without known public key (the ones you never sent from) would be way more safe and secure than used ones. Thats not something I personally would worry too much about, but if you can easily avoid re-using addresses, its of course a good thing to do, and also improves your privacy because your transactions can not be linked together that easily. Thats the reason why the mycelium HD creates a new address everytime you send or receive coins, for example.
@_date: 2015-01-29 23:09:48
Why? Would the possibility to use it annoy you? Or would you rather see development time spent on other features? 
@_date: 2015-01-23 12:49:47

Well, you cannot control the customers fee, but you can of course tell them to use a minimum fee, and not accept the payment without confirmation if they don't meet that fee, just as you would not accept payments with lower amount.

I don't know MalwareBytes, but some funny people included signatures / names / etc from known viruses as text in transactions, thus having them as part of valid blocks on every full node.

You will have to wipe the app data, then start the app and select "create new" when asked whether you want to import a backup. Before wiping the data, make sure you have everything you need backed up. So if you have a backup of your legacy single key account, verify that it works, then maybe send all coins you might have on HD accounts there. Or use a temporary wallet somewhere else, like on another phone, paper wallet, etc. 
Check that there are no other accounts needing backup, also check the archived ones. Be sure you don't need the labels from transaction history. 
If you echt to be sure, practice the process with the testnet version of the app. After creating a new seed back it up, then either import your legacy from backup or use the offline wallet feature to cold spend from the backup to your new HD account. 
Be careful, think a lot, don't rush anything, be sure you know what you do. I hear bad stories about lost coins too often. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:19:16

Yes, some miners have mined empty blocks in the past, and often miners do not fill blocks up completely. This is because blocks propagation time does still depend on the size. From my personal experience, transactions without fees can take any time to confirm or not be included in blocks at all if the coins are not a bit older. With fee of 0.1 mBTC I always made it into the next block as far as I remember. Lower fee sometimes skips a block or two but still works very reliable.

The address book is just there to save and label addresses, like if you often send money to the same address. If you want to monitor the balance, you have to go to the accounts tab (named keys in the previous version of mycelium) and add a single address account with that address.

This is _exactly_ what bitcoin is about: Building useful applications on top of a powerful underlying technology, and allow the users to choose whom they trust with how much money. Because you absolutely _can_ tip someone directly, but you can also use the comfortable service of changetip, and your risk of loosing money can be managed by _yourself_, cause you can decide how much you keep in there.
@_date: 2015-01-22 13:49:48
No, unless the bank in question has a very specific interpretation of "fraud prevention" or is very eager to block receivers which they guess will end up on the embargo lists sooner or later anyway. I guess some would rather over-comply or over-fraud-protect and loose some customers than risk being involved with something they dont understand or deem harmful to their business.
@_date: 2015-01-30 14:07:32
No problem, personally, I'd rather have it truly open as well. 
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:17:22
Push notifications is definitely on our list. Google cloud messaging is just somewhat unreliable, and we are still pondering how to do it. As for the warning: it should appear as soon as there is money in that account. We did not want to scare people when there is nothing at risk. Do you think we should show it even without money at stake?

AH, yes, I see your mail - did not reply cause I usually just take care of android stuff. Sorry no one has answered yet, people are spread out over different timezones, it sometimes takes a bit. You do not have to worry about your money, if you have the word list backup, everything is fine. There is probably a bug in recognizing this transaction. Do you need quick access to those coins? There are some other BIP39/44 wallets which could be used to recover funds. Trezor, mycelium on Android, wallet32, afaik there is some new Multibit HD (dont know if its out yet?) which also uses the same standards...

Well, enabling it for prodnet is just one setting, but we'd like to be sure we will not have to change the way we derive the keys, in order to not trash everybodys identites... so maybe we will have to try and propose a standard for this or something like that. But there are some other topics on our list as well....

Good choice of mobile wallet ☺
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:27:48
I am one of the developers working on mycelium, yes. The keys are AES encrypted in a SQLite database, located in the environments DATA directory under data\com.mycelium.wallet.WalletApplication\databases\ and the name should be walletbacking.db but I don't know if and how you are able to see or access that one. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:12:18
You mean like a "broken" base dictionary? Overlapping characters, similar words etc would not be a problem. At least not security wise, they could of course lead to problems with mis-typing etc. The only things that matter are the number of possible words, the number of words picked, and the randomness. Don't create your own seed by selecting words. Humans are terrible at creating randomness.

I know that doesn't help now, but "I forgot to backup my wallet" sounds like the mistake was not to back it up before wiping the phone. It was way earlier, backups shouldn't be made right before you expect the data to get erased, they should be made before you even send money to the wallet. Hardware and software can fail at any time, the phone can get lost or break - always have a backup that is verified to work before putting money in. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:13:06
Hehe, thanks a lot! They will surely improve my coding skills! 
@_date: 2016-03-07 21:57:06
All addresses in all HD accounts are derived from the same master seed. If you do have twelve words written down and stored safely, you are fine. If you want to confirm you have the right words, you can use the verify backup feature. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 07:57:24
Sadly, awareness doesn't help. Snowden delivered a ton of unbelievable stuff, the whole world should be out on the streets, but basically everybody - including all the governments - is like "Hu, that's bad, no ill get another beer and watch some movies".

It carries the brand name because the owner of mycelium decided he wants to have an iOS version as well. And it was developed by an external developer, because we - the Android devs - neither have the time nor the skill nor the intention to make an iPhone version.
@_date: 2016-03-02 15:25:29
I guess that "we take no fee" just means that they don't add a fee for receiving a wire transfer. I am pretty certain they will not be happy to pay the banking fees for the transfer just because you told your bank the receiver will cover it. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 10:02:48
It somehow seems odd to think of a Windows installation as "clean", but I guess that might work. With everything offline at all times you eliminated the biggest threat of someone stealing the keys afterwards. Be aware that another attack vector is to predetermine the keys you will generate. So make sure you have a version of bitaddress running that is clean, and that you got nothing bad in your OS or any other software that might alter what is sent to the printer, what is moved through the clipboard or written to excel, or how randomness is generated. 
Attacks where software manipulated Bitcoin addresses on the clipboard to trick users info sending money to the wrong address is not unheard of, so be careful. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:31:00
It is expose to all sorts of malware and attacks. Online wallets are even worse than software on your computer, they also depend on the service provider not stealing from you and not being to incompetent to protect your money. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 23:12:10
Actually, it increases adoption. It might turn some away, but it's not like a lot of people intend to look into Bitcoin, then read this and decide to not look into Bitcoin. But most people still haven't even heard about it, and some might become curious. Media telling how weird and bad and dead it is still gives way more new users then nobody ever mentioning it. But besides that, what Bitcoin needs currently isn't more growth, it's a solid plan how to get able to grow more... 
@_date: 2016-03-08 07:46:56
Yes - the new HD account will be derived from the same seed, making another backup will give the same words again. The point of that is that one single backup you make will be good forever, but of course that also means that a backup someone else has can be used to get money out of all present and future accounts derived from the seed.  
@_date: 2015-05-25 10:11:38
22 of those bought through the indiegogo campaign and 41 of those ordered directly have not been shipped yet. Problematic devices from the factory get carefully repaired and checked and as I get them from the hardware department I flash firmware, test them, and ship them out. Sorry for the delays, I know it's annoying, but we got the biggest part shipped and are working to send out the last devices as soon as possible. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:18:31
I don't really see them adding up to a system relevant amount of hashpower, but I'll be happy to be proven wrong. Anyway, we will see - I guess we will see cool projects though, where mining reduces the cost of heating. Like if you got to keep some plants warm using electricity, you might as well have mining hardware using the same power and emitting the same heat but giving you a little reward from a mining pool while doing so. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 09:48:58
Actually, that advice doesn't really strike it here, it should be: never send coins to a wallet before you have a (verified working) backup!

Guess what we need to tell is total worth of power consumed by miners and total loss of value for the mining equipment, and devide that sum by the bitcoins generated. I guess getting power consumption and electricity cost number estimations is easier then the devaluation of mining equipment...

The device will generate it's own master seed and derives private keys from that. So you have a new wallet. Otherwise it wouldnt improve security, if it would just use a wallet which was generated on an insecure, vulnerable device. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:04:17
Concerning "to which you have no key" : if I remember correctly, private keys which are intended to get used with compressed pubkeys just get a prefix. So if you have the key, you can access both, money sent to the compressed and the uncompressed pub key hashes. Afaik no money should get lost, just might be a bit of a hassle to convert stuff around. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:19:01
That's only a backup for the legacy account then. If you are super sure you didn't create a backup for the HD accounts yet, and the app says it would be an additional backup (and doesn't mark the HD accounts as "not backed up") think about whether it could be that someone got hold of your phone and maybe created a backup? If someone did, he could steal all current and future funds from all HD accounts at any time, so you might want to get a new master seed... 
@_date: 2016-03-20 09:52:45
Is it really all that different? Instead of keeping a seed safe, you need to keep a username and password combination safe. I get that passwords can often be remembered more easily than the seed word list, so you might get away without writing that down. But that also means it's way more likely that people use super week passwords or even reuse passwords they have elsewhere. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 17:07:05
That's only true for the low end of the scale, and mostly because "stuff is already there" so you treat it as if it was free cause you pay for it anyway. Cooling, powering and hosting one or two machines might not be a big deal, but they also don't do that much. With ten or twenty machines, the project starts to occupy your basement, creates more heat than you want in the house, etc. 
And the per device cost of coming, housing and cables is way way lower at a couple hundred or thousand miners compared to the hobby setup. 
So yes, these super small setups which evade the scaling because they are powered by already existing infrastructure which is paid for anyway do exist, but they are almost irrelevant to the big picture because they have to be super tiny to exist. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:35:14

No, there are no pull transactions. But you could look into payment channels, it's basically you making a payment and the service provider creating a delayed payment back and then the both of you exchanging that prepared payment with other ones periodically based on how much of your money has been used up for the service.

You sell ice cream.
I buy a car from you, but instead of actually paying, I submit an invalid transaction to blockchain.info which you check, and see the payment. You hand me the ice cream, I eat it, and some time later when I move my funds with a valid transaction, you figure out you actually have not been paid - it just looked like that because bc.i reported invalid data.

Certainly not high enough to be on the current short term to do list.

I am Jan Dreske, one of the Android developers at mycelium. Yes, I remember that mail. I have not researched number one yet, I don't know how easy it is to make a clickable link that works cross-app or cross-platform. Sharing the address is QR code is definitely on our list. Three would be possible, but currently I do not see it as important, because you usually have the written address along with the code, but I see some use cases for it. Sadly, we are few people and have really a lot to do here, so I cannot give you estimates on how long it might take till we get around to code these features...
@_date: 2015-07-16 08:44:11

Yes, there is an implementation for that in bitcoin core.
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:33:28
You are correct. Before getting base58 encoded for better human readability, the address double sha256 hashed and the first 4 bytes (so 8 characters) are appended to the address. If you want to see the details of how addresses get constructed,  you could use this site for example:

@_date: 2015-07-13 12:49:02
It's not part of the protocol, miners can decide how to handle this. There used to be a default in the core client reserving some space in a block for high priority transactions (determined through amount transacted and coin age) but I don't know whether it is still in or how many miners have this enabled. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:02:27
Restoring a backup from trezor in mycelium works, when you start a fresh install of mycelium select "restore backup" and you are then asked whether it is 12, 18 or 24 words and whether there is a password along with it. After entering everything, mycelium will only show the first account derived from that seed, if you had more accounts when using Trezor, you need to navigate to the accounts tab, hit the plus key icon, and add an additional HD account, you will then get the second account and so on. Let me know if there are any questions or problems!

If you don't trust the Entropy device, you can provide a user salt, verify it gets used by the device, and be sure nobody can know your private keys even if they device was tampered with. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 13:21:40
Rule of thumb for simple transactions: the threshold for priority is sending one bitcoin which is one day old. You can half the time requirement by doubling the amount and vice versa. Bigger transactions (with multiple inputs for example) have higher requirements. Detailed explanations can be found in the wiki or just google  bitcoin transaction priority, but I would not depend on this, adding some cents as a fee is usually a pretty good idea. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:26:08
Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:20:59
Yes, you cannot verify what it is doing, but by looking at the wallet client code you can see what it could potentially do. It never gets private keys so it cannot steal money, for example. 
Adding the possibility to connect the wallet to an (self run) insight server and later maybe libbitcoin and toshi as well is on the todo list... 
@_date: 2015-07-20 09:50:06

If you dont want to import and just spend from it, you can turn the word list into a qr code, scan it with the mycelium scan button, then it will ask for the password and allow you to spend from the seeds accounts. If you want to try, scan this (which is empty, obviously):

@_date: 2015-07-04 09:54:58
The only way your trezor could be affected is if whatever you use to monitor your balance is on thw wrong chain, you might get shown confirmations for incoming transactions although they are not confirmed on the correct chain, only the wrong one. This could potentially be used to trick you into believing you got money send while you did not receive it actually. Its still not easy to pull this off, and the coins you already have are as safe as always.
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:49:54
Hua, thanks for pointing this out, seems our server does not report new versions correctly!!
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:33:41
Yes. And depending on the specific usage patterns, they might cause each other not to fully synchronize correctly - depends on the specific synchronization implementation and whether it was built to be a shared wallet (likely not) or just as a backup mechanism. But in mycelium, for example, reloading the account should help in case something got stuck due to usage in other software.
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:12:08
It's been three servers already when I started working at mycelium more than a year ago - so no recent changes concerning the number of nodes. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 17:52:31
Yes, that works. You can also plug your Trezor into your Android phone if you want to to use I with nycelium. And yes, I think mycelium is a great wallet, but since I am one of its developers that's not a neutral opinion ☺
@_date: 2015-07-09 13:06:40
Our servers are under heavy load, and there can be inconsistencies when one node does not know about a transaction sent through another node. Unconfirmed (low fee) transactions currently sometimes need a lot of time to travel through the network, and the amount of unconfirmed transactions is really big. We are nearly done coding some optimizations, both server-side and app-side, to mitigate these problems...

@_date: 2015-07-20 13:56:45
Unless your phone is rooted, apps do not have access to the data of other apps, so they cannot just see keys stored by a bitcoin wallet. The clipboard is accessible by all apps, so be very careful if you use it to copy keys or addresses (because malicious apps could replace an address on clipboard and have you send money to a wrong receiver that way).
@_date: 2015-07-30 15:15:33
You can test by going to flight mode as well. Hopefully there will not be a next opportunity to see the servers down... ;)

Seems like (part of the) problem is the servers use up too many resources analyzing all those spam transactions, like signature verification, indexing, etc. Some optimizations are already in the pipeline, and Daniel is now carefully investigating what exactly is happening and what needs to be done to solve the problem permanently. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:47:27
There fact that the app does not consider a backup valid until verified and asks you to make sure it works is what makes it foolproof... 😕
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:57:39
Yeah, it's a bit of an exotic feature, I coded it for the Mycelium Entropy generated HD paper wallets, but it works for others as well of course. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:49:31
They are backwards compatible. If it says the password is invalid, it's not the password generated for this pdf. Maybe you did not write it down immediately but closed the app and then went back and created another backup, not sharing the pdf but writing down the password? Then you ended up with the pdf for the first run and the password for the second run. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:04:32
It is three servers in different data centers. I don't know anything about the iOS version, no idea whether it automatically switches to a new server if one is not responding...
@_date: 2015-07-20 09:15:42
And put the backup to which place? :P
@_date: 2015-07-15 09:39:02
There are three points of failure - three servers (running in different data centers). But even if they are down, no coins are at risk, backups are compatible with other wallets like trezor or multibit HD.
@_date: 2015-07-20 09:47:07
locations like.... safe deposit boxes? :P
@_date: 2016-02-09 18:28:59
Well, "as secure as" implies you have a very strong password. That means long and randomly generated. If you can memorize or safely store that, then you can do the same with the 12 words backup of mycelium. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 13:07:03
Dynamic fees are currently in beta test. And with "prevent unconfirmed transactions from disappearing" I didn't mean to keep them when they have been dropped by the network, but to keep them from disappearing from the wallet when it connects to a server node which has not seen the TX yet. (We solve this by having the servers exchange transactions directly, not just over the p2p network.) Long - term there are a couple of options, child-pays-for-parent hopefully solves all "tx not confirming" issues due to fees anyway. I already coded an option to delete a transaction on the phone but it's not enabled yet cause it would likely confuse people who will think it cancels the TX or something. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 17:45:51
Yeah, it is Android Studio which is based on IntelliJ IDEA.
@_date: 2016-02-28 00:06:03
Yes, Bip38 will not be brute forced. But having good passwords is a good habit to obtain. And if you re-use the same (or a very similar) password somewhere else (because you don't want to remember yet another one) then suddenly it doesn't help that bip38 is safe, someone obtains a password hash from somewhere, cracks that and then tries the password and some common variations on the encrypted wallet. 
There are just so many attack vectors and pitfalls, it can't hurt to be as careful as possible.

Maybe never directly, but you could try to protect access to your private key using fingerprint or retina scan - I am not sure whether software solutions to encrypt arbitrary data using a secret derived from fingerprint / retina do exist or how easy they are to set up and use...
@_date: 2016-02-22 08:36:28
Yeah, there is a distinction. But it will be tough to get data on not seen / not confirmed transactions for the past. If I broadcast a transaction that does not even get relayed by nodes, it is almost impossible for others to see it - only the nodes I sent it to will receive and then discard it. Transactions which do not get included in a block stay visible in the mempool for some time but eventually drop out, I am not aware of anybody collecting these.
So, variables you could gather:
* timing of blocks
* size of blocks
* numbers of transactions
* fee per kilobyte in transactions
* size of transactions
* (and then obviously fee per transaction)
* first seen time of transactions
* confirmation time of transactions
* fee suggested by other tools
you could even then look at some other stuff and look for potential correlations, like to total network hashpower or overall post activity on or of course the price of bitcoin. Maybe harsh changes in price trigger a higher transaction volume and raise the average fee, while heavy reddit activity goes along with higher transaction volume but same fee average or something.

The usual answer from hardware department is "end of year" but I am a bit sceptical about that. Don't have a real clue, though, am just concerned with Android development and it has been quite some time since I worked next to them and could play with the prototypes. 
@_date: 2016-02-27 06:20:02
Don't use a password you did come up with. Humans aren't good at creating randomness. Brains are predictable. The patterns in which we combine and alter words, replace characters etc are well researched. Algorithms can break that pretty reliable. If they get a fill - in - text along with that, even faster. Bip38 has anti-bruteforce measures, but still: if you are serious about security, don't use a human made password. Generate one randomly. It doesn't need to be random characters and special characters etc. Just determine ten or so words randomly and you have a super secure password that's impossible to bruteforce, and with some practicing easy to remember. Don't assume your ideas for passwords are smart. They are not. Software has cracked passwords that were citations in fantasy languages backwards with some letters replaced by numbers. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 00:12:56
Ah, sorry, that (very interesting) article I read some time ago, I don't have any link at hand currently. But I guess the fact that current algorithms try all kind of quotes from literature including fiction with elven languages, orcish or klingon and also apply all kind of replacement rules based on analysis of huge password databases can be found in a variety of articles on brute forcing, building rainbow tables, etc etc. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:55:50
We have not had time yet. But the priority for this feature suddenly increased :P
@_date: 2015-07-15 09:36:52
SPV is the wrong term here - the app connects to our nodes running full nodes plus custom backend software on top.
@_date: 2015-07-07 07:46:13
It is being worked on. (I would love a dynamic development team increase so there are more developers when more features are needed as well :) )
@_date: 2016-02-28 00:10:01
Yes, if massive means in a way that requires time, sure. But people tend to reuse passwords, and then someone cracks the database of some service that stores stuff just hashed once, brute forces your password and tries it on the paper wallet. Or people assume that these kind of passwords are fine for other stuff as well, make their email account vulnerable and open themselves up for password resets everywhere and social engineering etc. 
Can't hurt to be more careful. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 08:05:27
The Android wallet by mycelium does not use deterministic building yet. We have experimented with it, but did not find the time yet to switch over to deterministic builds. Concerning Android, if you want to be sure we do not steal your money, currently you need to build from source and install yourself.
As for iOS: I am not involved in the iOS apps development or publishing, I do not have an iPhone and have actually never used or seen the mycelium iOS app. There is really nothing I can say about that.
@_date: 2015-07-07 14:52:26
You can already share a bitcoin uri, on the balance screen hit "receive", enter optional amount, tap "share payment request" and you will get the bitcoin:1PuPFV19FxCwJVfEkwMxxxxxxTzQ8cpk?amount=0.00320359 thingie - I have no clue whether whatsapp or other communication apps or mail apps will turn this into a clickable link, though.
@_date: 2015-07-08 10:31:22
Actually I do not know what the status of that team is - I just asked who is currently responsible for answering questions about iOS, will share when I get an answer.
@_date: 2016-02-21 23:07:18
You can look at the fees paid in bitcoin transactions, look at average and spikes and compare it to the number of transactions, look at how very fast or slow blocks have impact on that, and if you can get the "first seen" timestamp of transactions you can even relate that to confirmation times. 
Then there are some tools which calculate recommended fee amounts and you could compare their algorithms to your findings. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 13:44:30
Only accepting once is also way better for your privacy. 
@_date: 2016-02-22 17:32:58
Yes, the address becomes public by that. The risk is only a privacy risk, coinbase now knows that you are the guy controlling the key for that address. To spend the bitcoin, a person would need to know the private key, which can not be obtained through knowing the address.

"It is being worked on" was not a hope or guess, but a statement :) I cannot tell you how long it will take, though. We are currently getting a hell lot of mail, and while I read everything it sometimes takes time till one of us gets around to work through and answer stuff. Was your mail the one about switching links to block explorers to tor addresses? That is being worked on as well :)
@_date: 2016-02-22 17:36:56
That depends on what your definition of spam is. You cannot actually know the intentions of someone, you can only guess. Just imagine you see a couple thousand product catalogs being shipped by postal service. You can not really know whether customers requested those, or they are unwanted advertisement. You can do some guesses, if someone sends a hell lot of super small transactions, or pops some money back and forth, he might be trying to disrupt the network. Or he might be testing some service he is building. Some gambling services pay a small amount of money back if you lost, as an indication that the bet is resolved. Some people consider that legit usage of the bitcoin network, others think it is unnecessary transaction spam. So there is no clear answer, it depends on what you think is legit use, and often you just cannot tell.
@_date: 2015-07-15 09:39:55
You can import the seed in trezor, multibit HD, wallet32 for example.

The app code is completely public to audition, and while you can't see the server code, you can make sure from reading the app code that private keys or seeds never get send to the server. 
You can of course only be 100% sure if you perfectly understand all of the code, or perfectly trust someone who does. I guess if we wanted to we could sneak something in which leaks private data in ways not obvious to novices. We are happy about anyone who is willing to audit the code and testify there are no back doors. 
In addition to trusting the public code, you need to fully trust us developers that the app we upload to pay store was actually built from the public code - unless you built and installed it yourself, if course. There is no way to verify what's on the play store corresponds to what's on github yet, we have experimented with deterministic builds but did not get around to switch over to use them yet. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 22:45:30

Ah, maybe I mixed iOS 6 and iPhone 5s or something. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:50:18
I do not know if this works on iOS, it does for sure not work on stock Android, your private keys will not be included in a full phone backup. I have no clue how data is stored on the iPhone, but I can imagine that it might not be part of the backup as well if flagged as sensitive or something like that. if you succeed, though, and manage to extract the master seed, it will probably not be in the form of a convenient word list. Additional steps will be required to turn it into a format to import somewhere else. During all that process of backing up, extracting and processing, you will use a potentially insecure computer - thats an additional risk. If I were you, I would just wait for the update, make sure to backup my seed before sending funds next time, and consider buying an Android phone.
@_date: 2015-04-05 09:38:28
Mycelium always puts all outputs in a random order. We recently received some good feedback about other possibilities and will look into them shortly! 
@_date: 2015-04-22 12:34:51
Your funds cant get lost. At this moment, the small fee usually works as good as the standard fee, and from time to time you have to wait for a few more blocks, so thats sometimes an hour or two extra on wait time. If the transaction volume spikes, this might be a far longer time - and generally, we rather have the users err on the side of 1.8 cents than unexpectedly having a transaction not confirm for a long time.

You can have a look at this explanation about how to send mail, and compare to how far we have come: 
@_date: 2015-04-14 01:42:57
I never used Multibit - and it sounds a bit weird that you had to input anything in addition to the 12 words. (if it asks for an optional password, that's empty for wallets created with mycelium) But don't worry, if you have the 12 words, you will get your coins.

@_date: 2015-04-02 09:22:22
Yes, that's true. I am really glad that we have a bunch of beta testers for the Android app - it's really good to have an additional layer of testing between trying on your own and pushing to 50k people. I am sorry I can't do anything for you - but should you ever get an Android phone feel free to blame me for any problems with mycelium on Android.

His username on reddit is oleganza, and ios should work for mailing him.
@_date: 2015-04-03 02:20:27
Yes, the 12 words is all you need. They are put through the pbkdf2 algorithm to create the root key for a tree like hierarchy used to derive private keys. The word list backup mechanism is described in BIP39, the hierarchy system in BIP32  and then specific account structure used in BIP44. These are standards also implemented by other wallets like Trezor for example - so you could restore your Mycelium backup on a Trezor and vice versa.

We are discussing the topic of making backups necessary to use the wallet etc all the time. The problem is to find a balance... We don't want to make it impossible to use the wallet without backup, cause people will likely use another wallet (and make no backup) or note it down on a napkin in a bar when showing mycelium to someone and then lose it and still continue using the wallet etc. It's really a tough topic. I just can't understand why people put serious amounts of money in there without making sure they will be able to get to it again. I mean, they could just as likely lose their phone or have it get damaged or stolen... 
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:30:54
Thanks a lot! (Sadly, there are no girls involved currently.)
@_date: 2015-04-15 20:46:29
A Trezor has one big security advantage over a paper wallet when you redeem the wallet, you type or scan the key with a potentially insecure device, and if an attacker then spends the coins faster then you, or changes the target address, you have a problem. Trezor does not give out the key, just a signed transaction. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 03:21:22
Yes, the 12 word pass phrase is all you need. If mycelium went down you would still be able to get to your funds (its not just a single encrypted private key, its a lot of them - but still). If you want to read about how exactly it works, have a look over here:

The transaction confidence bar from local trader does some cool checks, like looking for mutated or conflicting transactions and even for unconfirmed parent transactions, but it cannot shield you from a miner directly mining a double spend or a conflicting tx getting distributed to replace-by-fee nodes after you checked the confidence bar. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 00:11:02
It is not like the usual end-user wallets allow you to do that, you probably have to use some special tools and ignore some warning to get that transaction created and broadcasted. Not really something possible to achieve with everyday-use.
That said, myceliums fee settings are awesome, aren't they? ;)
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:13:17

Your points are perfectly valid. There are a lot of people who do not have actual problems which Bitcoin can solve right now. And if you are fine with everything as it works for you, as you said, you shouldn't bother to try and force yourself to use it. The reason for me being so enthusiastic about it is not because it makes my everyday life so much easier (yet). There are benefits to using it for me, but to be honest, that's probably not worth the hassle to learn everything for most. I just see the huge gigantic technology (and social) potential. This will change a good part of our lives. 
The comparison is often made, and it works quite well: think about the early days of the internet, talking about emails. It's tough to send one, you need to write weird stuff into command lines. And why would you want to send a message to the other side of the world any way? There is only a couple of nerds you can write to anyway. And your postal service is fine, it works, you can even insure letters and complain to someone if they don't arrive. 
So should everybody have jumped on board using email back then? Probably not, for most people it wasn't worth the hassle. But it was important that a couple of users and engineers saw the potential of email and internet and went on developing. And for everybody, the point where it actually grew useful was met sometime during that development, some got in early, some got in late. But now even your grandma sends mails. 
If you don't see Bitcoin improving your life now, that's totally fine. Just keep an eye on it, cause at some point it will. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 08:33:29
What is your questions? If you want to examine your wallet with the tool you linked, you just need to input your backup word list in the topmost field (mnemonic). If you want to get the xpriv key of a specific account, select that account in mycelium, hit export from the action bar menu, then switch the slider from public to private.

The new iOS release sadly has to bugs, one is preventing sending, the other is preventing making a backup. So if you do not already have a backup (and you should ALWAYS make sure to have a backup BEFORE sending money to any wallet - your phone could just as likely have been lost / stolen / damaged) the best thing you can do is to wait for an update with a fixed version - do not uninstall the app, do not delete the app data.

There is a testnet version of mycelium available in the play store. You can get testnet coins using local trader in mycelium (the buy/sell Bitcoin button) and "buy" them for free from a bot called virtual trader. Use them to try stuff, send coins around your wallet, make a backup, wipe the app, restore backup etc. That way you can test everything without risking money.

Sending to yourself is sweeping - we just allows you to pick which of your accounts you want to send to, or to send to someone else or an address not in your wallet... As you said it, it wouldn't be faster, instead or easier, would it? Instead of selecting your address you would select "sweep" and then the account you want to sweep to. If you want to send all, you don't have to do calculations, there is a max amount button where you enter the amount.

The key for the coinapult acc gets derived from the master seed, so the 12 word backup you hopefully asked have is good for the coinapult acc as well. 
If I remember correctly, there are no explicit fees, but the exchange rates for locking (selling) and unlocking (buying) differ. 
A new coinapult account is automatically created.

The problem: having all the pub keys in a database isn't hard. And while the hashing is taking a home computer quite some time, there are asics out there which do this very efficiently. So it would be brute-forceable, and I could even start with doing that right now and when the method becomes widely used I already have a database of keys I monitor to take the money sent to them... 
Next downside: you heavily rely on specialized software to get your coins. With a 12 word seed remembered, you can use different options to get the coins - with this, you wake up naked in the middle of nowhere and then need to get the code to do this somewhere before getting access to money.

The explicit fee is not really that important, because you have to check which exchange rate they use. There is no fee on myceliums side, the app just provides access to their services, so for fee and exchange rate information check out coinapult.com and cashila.com :)

You do not understand, I fear. If the device fakes the raw entropy, than you will see that the key is not based on your salt + raw entropy, so you will know that it's fake. If the key matches Sha256(salt|entropy) you know that nobody knows your key, cause it's impossible for the device to select raw entropy in order to create a certain key.

Of course the price could be one dollar. But let's say there is 10 million Bitcoin in free fluctuation and we have a hundred million regular users. Everybody could - at a price of 1 usd / coin, have ten cents worth of bitcoin on average, which will not be enough to buy coffee. They will want more, and if everybody else wants more as well, they will need to outbid them. And then the price rises.

I guess you are referring to Jan Møller, but since I happen to be named Jan as well and actually am employed by mycelium let me try to give a statement as well: Jan Møllers new company has nothing to do with mycelium, they have no access to our servers and we actually even blocked connections to their nodes after we learned about this today. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 11:00:54
First, its not easy for malware to "read the memory" cause every app is run in its own protected environment, other apps can not easily access the memory. Second, it would not help, since our app does not know the digit positions at all, only the trezor knows it, and mycelium only tells trezor the positions, trezor then checks whether the digits on those positions match the PIN.

we should probably have local trader still work and just warn the user that he will not get notifications on his phone about new trade activity if he does not have gapps.

There is no choice to craete a new separate seed because users will lose money. They will create one, not read the warnings, get their phone lost / stolen / damaged and then wonder why they cannot re-create it from the backup they made of the other seed. There aren't that many use cases for this, and mycelium is after all a mobile wallet - so for extra fancy stuff we kind of expect that people will more likely use a full blown desktop client anyway. You can import xpub and xpriv keys though, so if you generate an hd account elsewhere you can use it in mycelium (and we can assume you have a backup since you scanned the key from somewhere).
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:24:12
Actually it's tougher to analyze myceliums users than many others. With HD wallet, randomized order of outputs, and the mycelium servers broadcasting all transactions created on the phones, our users are giving away far less info and his nodes just can see that a transactions was probably send by "a mycelium user", not which one. That said, we also just blocked all known chainalysis servers from connecting to our mycelium servers directly.

It is a bad idea to re-use addresses, even worse doing so blindly. You should always confirm the intended recipient can receive at the address you are sending to. You should also consider to stop sending coins directly from service to service. Withdraw to your wallet first, then send on. If the receiver needs you to prove you sent the money, you can sign a message with your wallet - does not work when sending from coinimal directly. If something goes wrong, you immediately know whether its coinimals or alphabays fault - does not work when sending directly. If the receiving service does stupid stuff like "returning" money to the address it came from, it will be under your control if it was sent from your wallet, does not work if it came from another service.
That said, if the balance does not show up in your account, you should contact the receiving service (alphabay in this case) and tell them, and ask them to credit it to your account. Not sure whether that works, because you sent directly from another service, so you cannot prove it was you who sent it, and they cannot just return it because you will not control the funds then.

I am not sure I get what you are asking for, sorry. You want to be able to remove an HD account from the UI completely (instead of just archiving it?) What do you mean by "multiple Parent Key feature" - is this just referring to "having multiple master seeds", or something else? "Liking it personally" is not a strong incentive for me to provide a feature, unless I want to please you very hard for some reason (how early an adopter are you - is there some hidden bitcoin millions to be had?). So what problem would I solve when allowing multiple master seeds? (I only know of problems I will create so far...)

Thats of course your free choice, and I totally respect it. I am not reluctant to talk, though, I just do not want to create the impression I am officially speaking on behalf of the company. I can tell you that Jan Moller is not providing code for mycelium any more, is not having access to the servers, play store etc. He is available to me for questions about code he wrote earlier. Mycelium servers do not log any ip addresses, though we could in theory if we wanted to, and you cannot know whether we do (you would have to trust us we dont). When using the tor option in the wallet, the phone connects via hidden services to the servers, making it impossible to log ip.

The cold storage feature is the ability to scan a private key not stored on the phone (from paper, thus "cold", since it's not on the online device, which is considered "hot") and directly spend from it. Concerning losing the phone: what you should do right away (before your phone gets lost, broken or stolen) is make a backup. You just need to write down twelve words and store them in a safe place. This is a standardized method defined in BIP39 so you don't depend on mycelium, you could restore your backup on a Trezor or wallet32 or any other compliant wallet as well.

Wiping can be achieved by making one transaction per account. Init and restore of Trezor is not really on the list right now - it's a pretty rare thing to do and not exactly a use case where a mobile setting is helpful, right? If you have convincing arguments we can consider this...

If she installs mycelium now (good choice) there isn't "her private key", she gets a HD wallet. Just tell her to make a backup, or make one with her together, write down the 12 words on paper and tell her to keep it in a safe place. I guess thats fine, your not gonna send thousands. You can ask her later if she still has her backup. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 19:48:38
You pretend to be a lot of people, for example by running a lot of Bitcoin nodes. This allows for example to better estimate where a transaction originated cause you are connected to a big part of the network and see which nodes report a transaction first. You could also try to isolate other nodes by getting them to connect only to nodes you control, and could then control which data goes to them and from them. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:57:03

Its probably a way better idea to dedicate certain accounts to certain people you expect money from. Like having an HD account to receive salaries, probably giving the xpub to your employer so he can derive the next address(es) to send to himself.

I am not sure I do get your question correctly. The transaction broadcasted is just a regular bitcoin transaction, it does not contain anythign specific to your phone. Concerning the communication between phone and our servers, there is no special phone related data included. Our servers do know the phones ip address if it connects over the clearnet. But neither do the servers store this info, nor does Jan Moller have access to them in the first place.

Thanks a lot for your feedback! I am only working on the Android version, iOS is a completely different team. PIN is on their list for next release afaik, though. Having the password entry popping up with a question is an interesting idea, I'll put that on our list. The reason you cannot import another master seed is that we want the app to always just have one seed. It's already tough to get users to make backups, if their backups only work for half of their accounts money will be lost. Your use case is perfectly valid, though. With our next release, there will be the option to do cold spending from a seed. So you can scan a QR code with the word list, wait for sync, select an account, spend from it and the wallet immediately forgets the seed again. That way you could at least empty your seed to another account or address. Maybe we should allow users to type the seed in addition to scanning? And I will put a point on our list to better explain creation and deleting of HD accounts - they are all based on the same seed. Unless you import some xpub or xpriv. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 20:38:41
Trezor is micro usb. You need the Trezor cable (male micro to male regular) and the other cable (male micro to female regular) together.

If mycelium servers disappear, you can import your backup in another BIP 32/39/44 compliant wallet like Trezor, Wallet32, the new multibit HD etc. If you do not want to rely on those services either, you could use a tool to extract the private keys from the backup - the backup structure (BIP39 word list) is defined in a standard, so you do not depend on the mycelium servers or the app to access your money.

You do not create an address and then "give a private key to it". Its the other way round, you create a private key, and then derive the public key from that, and then derive the address from that. And though it would in theory be possible that two people create the same key, the numbers are that friggin big, and the probability is that fucking low, that its actually fair game to state its impossible.

Thanks for your nice words. Yeah, I should maybe take a break and get lunch or something. Its really interesting but also costs a lot of energy to try and closely follow all these discussions and grasp the momentum of it and try to not have people go spinning on weird assumptions. I also understand that it was pretty stupid to not clearly communicate Jan Mollers status earlier. Godod thing is I am not concerned about the wallet, our security, etc at this point. The "google banned us from playstore" episode was worse, I was really concerned about the future of the app. But then again, we had all of reddit behind us, stating nice things, causing a warm feeling. Well, I guess it just can't be nice and dandy all the time, and a least I know that nothing is wrong with us, we are not be blamed etc. It's sad if our reputation takes a ditch and we lose some users, but that can't be helped, I guess. I hope Jan ( Jan Moller - my name is Jan as well, Jan Dreske, so thats sometimes confusing) posts something soon and then he'll get all the lovely attention of the reddit mob for some time :)

Yes, I got that. I just wanted to know whether its more like a "I don't trust mycelium to not compromise my privacy" decision, a "I feel like you guys are bastards for being involved with somebody doing stuff I deem evil and do not want to use your products" decision or more like "I do want to teach you a lesson and make you feel bad and encourage others to stop being mycelium users" type of thing. If its the first, I am happy to tell you why there is no reason to be concerned. If its the second, we might talk a bit about whats actually going on and how exactly mycelium is or is not tied to this, but ultimately it's just your decision. if its three, there is really nothing I can do about that, and I probably wouldn't bother to reply further, because it will likely just cost the two of us time and energy and lead nowhere.

It's possible to provide a user salt and verify that it's used - with that, even a compromised device does not endanger the coins.

Well, I don't know anything about ruby. I am one of the guys coding the mycelium bitcoin wallet for Android, for that, I need to know Java. But other projects use other languages. There are some programming language independent things to learn about bitcoin. Like how private key, public key and address depend on each other. Have a look at this for example: 
Or read the initial white paper, if you have not yet: 
Learn how mining works, how transactions are built, what mixing is, how HD wallets work etc etc. You can set yourself a goal. Like "I want to adda button to a wallet doing xy". Or you said you want to use bitkit - what for?Figure out what exactly you want to achieve, then try to get there, step by step, and whenever you cannot figure out how to go on, ask specific questions.

Actually, when all the bitcoins will be mined, nothing special is going to happen. During this transition period, mining income will start to rely more and more on transaction fess and less on the actual block reward. This does not mean that the transaction fees will grow, maybe its a combination of increased transaction volume, less competition in mining, more power-efficient mining equipment (reducing the costs of running it) etc etc. The number of newly mined coins will have been very very low for decades already, its a slow transition, so the final point of no more new coins might only have a psychological impact. Celebrations and cake and so on. The number was picked by satoshi, he tried to come up with something reasonable estimated on how widespread usage he guessed the system to have. He admitted its nearly impossible to make good predictions. It does not matter all that much anyway, the important thing is that its fixed and transparent.

Mycelium follows BIPs 32/39/44 - you can directly import the word list backup into Trezor, Wallet32, the new Multibit HD, etc. There are also tools to extract the keys, for example

That really depends on your background and where you want to go. Do you have any coding experience or prior knowledge, like, do you know what a hash is, for example? Do you want to understand how Bitcoin works way down below, or learn how to use libraries which take care of that and build something on top of Bitcoin? Do you want to dedicate a lot of time to getting in deep, or just start playing a bit around in your free time? Your question is a bit broad, like someone asking for pointers in order to "get into cars". Do you want to learn how to drive? Learn the traffic rules and signs? Design traffic lights and parking lots? Collect oldtimers? Be able to repair a car? Understand how engines really work? 
@_date: 2015-03-31 13:42:05
We made sure to stick the signature to both sides of the app, so the keys cant fall out.
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:23:10
Hmm, thats weird. Are the transactions confirmed? Have you checked on blockr.io or another block explorer? Could you try to backup and re-import the master seed in wallet32? If mycelium is fine, I hopefully dont have to fix any bugs, and its a wallet32 problem, but I'll be happy to assist with debugging. Maybe you can contact the wallet32 devs and have them look into the issue.

On a technical level, there is nothing you can do. From an ethical level, most people likely agree the receiver should give it back, but "it's your fault, take care of what you are sending" might be a position some hold. 
From a legal perspective, I do not really know but I suspect if it is obvious that there was no intention to actually send that money, the receiver might have to give it back. Practically that will likely not happen, as it is maybe difficult to figure out who the receiver is, what jurisdiction is responsible, then you would need to find a court willing to deal with it, and it's hard to proof it was a mistake etc etc. 
If it was an error in the software or service you used to send, you might be able to hold the company providing that service responsible - depending on what terms you used that service on. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 10:22:48
We (mycelium) are not logging ip addresses. We could, if we wanted to, so you just have our word unless you run it in tor mode. When connecting to our servers via a hidden service, there is no way for us to log any ip.

Yes, I know, but we fixed it. I did not say the task is trivial, but its not like you need to be a huge company or agency to be able to change some stuff in node code to track certain things, and then fire them up somewhere.
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:42:33
As I understand, it was not like "lets pick 21 million", but more like "lets start with 50 coins as block reward, and then halve it every 4 years, which is roughly 210.000 blocks". This turns out to give us a total money supply just short of 21 million.

There is a company which runs a lot of modified bitcoin nodes to get a lot of connections from other nodes and track from which ip addresses transaction originate.
@_date: 2015-10-02 08:49:51
That has actually been discussed before, but it is not as easy as it might sound at first. Changing the block size limit is just tweaking one screw. When you change the block frequency, you either increase the supply of new bitcoin as well, because block rewards are paid more often (and you probably do not want to do that, I guess there will be no consensus whatsoever for that) or you need to cut the block rewards in half when cutting the block time in half. It is likely even more tricky to get consensus for that, because its more complicated to grasp and you need to find a good time to make the change because changing block rewards at a random point in time and increasing block frequency might need quite some changes for a lot of services to still work and maybe just simply feels weird for many because it changes two things which have not been touched since the launch of bitcoin instead of increasing the size limit which had been introduced as a temporary solution anyway.
@_date: 2015-03-13 22:02:27
That was actually not intended and will be fixed, if I got Jan's statement right.

That's true, the keys cannot leave the Trezor. Mycelium just asks Trezor to please sign a transaction, and it does if the users presses the button after checking amount and destination address.

@_date: 2015-03-16 19:18:04
Hmm, yeah - I would probably be okay with having some kind of "switch to a new seed" feature - but not so much with managing two seeds at the same time. And yes, we try to give good advice and have the users read it, but reading through our support mail really horrifies me from time to time. Despite telling everybody to make backups, people lose thousands of dollars cause their phones get lost / stolen / damaged or their kids uninstall mycelium to make room for games. And so many just don't make a backup. So if someone makes a backup, we really want that it will work for as much as possible as long as possible.

I, personally, know all that because I am writing the code, I built, signed and uploaded the version currently published on the app store. I also know that our servers do not log ip addresses and that Jan Møller has no access to them. But concerning how you should know: currently, you should build from source yourself if you are concerned about the app store version. We are working on implementing deterministic builds to make it possible for everyone to check that the published code matches the published apk, but till then, if you want to be safe, build yourself. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 13:49:23
Of course it's a big difference. But the difference isn't that bitcoins money supply does not inflate. It does. The difference is that bitcoins money supply inflation is perfectly known in advance, while the one for fiat currencies is not.

Yes, and because you don't know whether we lie when we state we do not log users ip, you could use the tor feature to connect to our servers via a hidden service and then we could not do it even if we wanted to.

SHA on some entered words is a bad idea because you would need to make sure the words don't get intercepted and are not predictable. Humans are bad at making random choices. But if you combine user generated Entropy (through dice, for example) with hardware based Entropy, you are safe if either is compromised. If the hardware uses predictable values it does not compromise keys if they are derived from a combination of those predictable values and unpredictable user salt.

I am not officially speaking on behalf of the company - I am not the guy being responsible for or authorized to manage public communication. I am one of the software developers working for mycelium. You have no way to verify we do not log ips for clearnet connections. For tor, feel free to audit the code here:  and check that with tor setting enabled, only hidden services are used. We are working to provide deterministic builds as well, so that all the people who install via play store or download the app from our website can verify its the same as what those get who build from the published code themselves.

It also allows to provide a user salt via a settings file and to verify that it's being used, so even a tampered with device would not compromise your keys.

There is a way for cold storage HD. The Mycelium Entropy supports printing them, you will get one QR code with the seed (and the words written down as well) and one with the accounts xpub key. You can scan the xpub, the wallet will figure out what the next unused address in that account is and send to it. To redeem, you can either cold-spend from the seed or import it somewhere. The Entropy firmware can already create them, and the next wallet release will have the features for using them.

If people could be certain that the price will rise, they would by now for a certain win after halving. They do so until the price is near enough to what they expect it to be so there is no value in buying more.
Of course at the same time there are a myriad influences in addition to that. So basically, the price reflects what people think about the utility now and the price in the future. It has been like that for ever, and it works that way with or without halving, because that is a known event that effects the expectation of future price right now, and not only once the event happens.
If something unexpected happens, people suddenly adjust their expectations of future price and thus the current price changes. But the halving will not surprise anyone.

@_date: 2015-03-31 22:45:47
In order to do that, either we would have to do it, or someone would need to control each and every single connection our servers have to the Bitcoin network. But yes, it's a potential problem, and we plan to implement spv fallback at some point. It's just not likely - and the worst thing which can happen is you need to import your backup somewhere else if mycelium isn't working any more. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:41:17
Yes, if you send a transaction using mycelium, your phone sends this transaction to our servers, and the bitcoin nodes running on our servers broadcast the transaction to the network. If we wanted to, we could log your phones ip address on our servers and connect it to your transaction. We do not do this, but of course you might not trust my statement. if you want to be sure, you need to use tor (enable the setting in mycelium app and have orbot running on the phone). With the setting enabled, the app will only connect to our servers using a tor hidden service, thus we cannot know your ip. Jan Moller has no access to our servers and no privileges to upload altered mycelium versions to google play or our homepage.
@_date: 2015-03-13 12:13:28
With the new version of mycelium (testnet published, prodnet in beta) you can import these xpubs as watch-only and also pay to them, and you can also just scan them when sending and mycelium will figure out what the next unused address is to send to.

That depends on what you look at. Thats why I clearly wrote about the supply. For the value, it is also not exactly true to categorally state that "bitcoin = deflation". Thats maybe a long term hope, but neither strictly true all the time nor a system necessity.

There are no "backup files", the pre-HD backup is a pdf you should have printed and then written a password on it, the HD backup is 12 words you should have written down. If you are not sure whether you have a working backup, you should 1) make a new one immediately, and 2) consider to create a fresh wallet and migrate your money, because you cannot be sure any more that nobody else has a backup....
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:13:06

Just tell me! The list is pretty long, and we are pretty busy, but feedback is always appreciated!
@_date: 2015-10-05 07:49:35
Thats actually what I was trying to address with the first option I stated, but I admit that was not very clear. By "increase supply of new bitcoin" I meant "increase supply per time" and not "increase total supply" - we will likely all be dead when the latter matters anyway. I did not even think about increasing the total supply, that would need yet another change - doubling the number of blocks till a halving occurs....
As for the security, as I see it (without doing math) it would only decrease the security per block, but not per time. Having 3 confirmations with 5 minute blocks is less secure than 3 confirmations with ten minute blocks, but it takes half the time - having half an hour worth of confirmations does not get less secure if its 6 confs at 5 mins instead of 3 confs at ten mins, I think.
@_date: 2015-03-16 15:25:51

Though Jan Moller is involved in both chainalysis and mycelium, neither he nor the company chainalysis have access to the mycelium servers. Our servers do not log ip addresses. (We could, technically, if we wanted to, though.) If you use the tor feature of mycelium, the app connects to mycelium via hidden services, making it impossible for us to log ip addresses, even if we wanted to.

Mycelium actually consists of a nice selection of male persons... 
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:07:55
But transaction fees dont just grow. You can broadcast a transaction with any fee - the question is whether it gets included in a block. In order to be forced to pay a high fee, there must be either a very high competition for block space, which is unlikely considering that we will probably have a growing block space soon, or miners consent on rejecting transaction with a fee under a threshold - and I am pretty confident that there will always be some miners willing to include transactions and earn a little money instead of not including them and earn nothing.

You cannot identify who (as in "which person") you are talking to as a server, but you cannot do that with the username / password scheme either. But you can make sure its the same guy every time, and that is actually more secure and works easier (imho) than username / pass combinations.

If you need an HD account for passing through, I would really just print a HD paper wallet, cold-spend from it, and either keep it somewhere safe or burn it after usage. Heck, maybe just cold spending from a single key paper wallet is better than creating new keys on the phone - when cold spending, the address and key don't even ever see the phones storage, they just briefly stay in RAM.

The generated randomness is based on the random power-up state of SRAM cells - there is a scientific paper describing the quality of randomness, on which this device is based. According to that paper, we are fine. Its this one:

I think a lawsuit is the least helpful way to act. If that's the only way to protect us, we are doomed. How about educating people about what's possible and which options they have to prevent these analysis? How about evaluating how and why exactly the network was harmed and how this can be solved technology wise? You can't go around and hit everybody who misbehaves with a lawsuit. It will likely not work, you will likely not even be able to find out who misbehaves a lot of the time, and some of those players might be agencies, law enforcement, governments - have fun going after them. Making the protocol and tools more robust is by far the better way, IMHO.

OK, 1. from expert features is definitely on the list. I am curious, what's your reasoning for 2 and 3, just saving on fees, or is there any other use case? 
@_date: 2015-03-10 10:38:40
Fuck the octopuses!
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:01:07
Yeah, sure - when I said the only way to force up fees is competition, I meant the fee per transaction, not the accumulated fee per block. Increased number of transactions obviously increases the total block reward. But if the number of transactions does not increase fast enough, it will not cause the fee per transaction to magically go up. It's the other way round - if the number of transactions increases heavily, the fee per transaction will likely increase as well, cause there is bigger competition for block inclusion during burst times. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 00:20:06
Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-03-13 14:44:55
Yes, thats true. He cannot know which of the mycelium users it was, though. And we just blocked all currently known chainalysis servers from connecting to our mycelium servers.
@_date: 2015-03-14 13:43:40
Well, you can set a PIN in the app - so critical functions are already protected. Exchanging a PIN for a password and requiring it to open the app instead of just for sending and other critical operations adds some security but it's not a huge difference. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 13:55:20
You can flash your own firmware on an Entropy device. You cannot flash the firmware on a regular USB drive - the Mycelium Entropy might look like one, but it's pretty different inside. It contains a processor for the key generation calculations, static RAM cells as source for high quality randomness etc etc.

The reason for his ban as I get it from reading the irc logs was: Developers explicitely do not want political or philosophical stuff discussed in the dev channel, because they want to focus on technical discussion within that channel. And they said whoever wants to discuss other stuff should please go ahead and create a channel for that, instead of hijacking the dev channel. Mike Hearn complained in the dev channel about not being able to discuss the stuff in dev channel and because he kept bringing up the topic in there instead of having the discussion elsewhere, he was banned. Thats how I understood it from reading the logs, everyone is free to create his own interpretation by reading up on it .

Millions of dollars is a bit too much. But I dont feel like thats going to be rough at all. Miners want to break even, sure, but thats the problem of miners. They will not stop taking small fees just because they would have liked bigger ones. If there is money, someone will take it. The only way to force up fees is by having people compete for speed of block inclusion. And thats fine, imho. The roughest spot of the decrease in rewards is right ahead of us, I am really curious how the reward halving will influence price, mining etc.

You can provide a salt in the settings - the device will then use that salt as entropy for the key as well, and will also print out the raw entropy generated so you can confirm it uses the salt.

For importing a watchonly HD account, you need to import that accounts xpub key. You can get that through exporting it from another mycelium install, importing from a Trezor device, you can create HD paper wallets with mycelium entropy or use any other tool to generate xpubs and then import them.
@_date: 2015-03-06 10:04:36
The price does not go up to a million in a heartbeat. Its a process, and software will adapt. It has before, and will again. Dynamic ways to calculate fees are being introduced, and even if wallets use hardcoded fees, they will just change these numbers when the price goes up some orders of magnitude.
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:08:42
That actually seems not too complicated. Except for usd value, that would need to wait till we have historical price data. I'll have a look tomorrow, maybe I can sneak in a lightweight version...

That would be an option, though just using a Mycelium Entropy to print a couple of HD paper wallets might be easier. Or use any other means to produce some paper wallets with xpub and xpriv key on them or something.

Yeah, we could use some UI we already have, and need to manage the communication with the Trezor. It's not a huge task, probably, but it needs to be done and tested and so on. It's not like we don't want to have it, but we need to prioritize as well. There are things like coinshuffle and bip70 and multisig and whatnot and hundreds of small features waiting for implementation... I'll put it on our list, but no promises...

SO the difference is the number being fixed or not, and the number being known or not. But in both systems, money supply increases. If I want to buy a bitcoin today, a certain number of coins are potentialy available. If I want to buy one tomorrow, that number is bigger. The fact that I know in advance that they will exist doesnt make them exist or being available now.
Bitcoin has money supply inflation. It is a well known, fixed and predictable inflation, which is a big and important difference when compared to fiat systems, but its nonetheless inflation.

Yes - not waiting for a confirmation. A lot of merchants already do this, when I order pizza for btc I never have to wait for confirmations. First, it's at this moment pretty complicated to try and double spend a transaction, even an unconfirmed one. Second, it's possible to see the attempt, so within a couple of seconds you can be pretty sure it has not been tried, and to try it later makes it by far less likely to succeed. Third, payment processors probably insure against this and will in many cases probably involve law enforcement - is it worth trying to double spend the coke transaction after you walked out of the shop and then hope you did not get caught on a security camera which will easily be able to mach your face with the facebook profile picture? And then there are of course more sophisticated options like opening a payment channel with your preferred coke provider to handle payments.

Receiving a lot of small payments does, for example mining pool payouts which happen daily, using bitcoin faucets. Very heavy usage can also lead to this, depending on your wallet implementation. Whenever you make a payment and have an output in your wallet which is slightly bigger, you have some leftover small change on an address. If that is never important in order to make another payment, or if the wallet software optimizes for transaction size, or tries to improve privacy by not using multiple inputs in transactions, you just get a growing collection of small transaction outputs.

"Paywall" as in "service charging money to give access to some digital goods"?

Thats pretty weird, it should be the same, because as far as I know wallet32 follows BIP32/44/39 just as we (mycelium) do. Could you give me some more info? Are both wallets fully synchronized? Do they have same transaction histories in the accounts= Do all account balances differ, or just one? Is it completely off, or are just some transactions missing on one side?
@_date: 2015-02-05 08:56:53
Dont meet in dark lonely places. If you feel like you could get in trouble and want to remove the info about the trade afterwards, you can delete entries from your local trader history in mycelium. The chats are encrypted, even if someone would seize the mycelium servers he could not know what you were writing to the trade partner.
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:07:48
what do you mean by "getting cracked"?
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:49:32
Since you would love to hear about others: BIP39 allows for an optional password, which will yield another master seed when used with the word list backup. You could use your wallet a bit without password or a throwaway password, and use the same word list with another password for bigger holdings. If you reveal the word list (and the throwaway pass) it will show as a used wallet, maybe with some small amounts on it, and maybe nobody knows there is another pass for more money.
@_date: 2015-02-12 09:20:23
If you want to try it, get the mycelium testnet wallet. You can obtain testnet coins by opening local trader in it (the buy / sell bitcoin button) and "buy" from a bot called virtual trader for free. You can then send around, create accounts, try to backup, wipe app data, restore etc to get used to everything without risking money. The real app works like the testnet app, it just flips a switch to use other version bytes in addresses and connects to main net server instead of testnet server.
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:10:36

I am not sure you understood the questions correctly. I would see the first question as "does revealing one bitcoin address of a HD wallet also reveal the other ones" and that is clealry answered with no. However, if the questions was "does something exist, which will reveal all bitcoin addresses in a HD wallet when revealed itself" the answer is yes.
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:11:02

You should not accept anything else but cash, its very likely someone is trying to scam you. I am sorry you experience these offers, I never got one so far... Besides that, there are some common sense rules to make sure you don't get robbed, same as for localbitcoins deals. Like, meet in public space, maybe some place with many people and video surveillance, not some back alley. Start out with small amounts if you dont know the trader yet. maybe meet in some cafe and sit down together and talk a bit, if it feels really sketchy back out...
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:53:37
Thats perfectly fine. Cold spending has not changed with HD - it creates a single address account separated from the other accounts in your wallet, uses the same address for change, and wipes all the data about that account from its memory right after you made the transaction.

Yes, the accounts have their own sequence of addresses, but they are derived from the same master seed. The 12 words is all you will need to restore all current and future HD accounts. You can also use them in Trezor, wallet32 for Android, and everything else compliant with bip 39, 32 and 44.

I have seen people pump a couple hundred bugs into their wallet, then feeling like something does not work, and uninstall / reinstall the app. Then they found out they just destroyed their money cause they did not bother to make a backup. if they had invested 15 minutes and tried everything with the testnet version first, they would have learned a lot, known what to do, and not risked a single cent.

There is no check box, you accept changes by running client software which accepts them.

It uses random positioning just like with mytrezor. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:11:36
Right now it's still a bit faster to broadcast empty blocks - without financial incentives miners could opt not to include transactions in blocks, making their lives simpler and decreasing probability of orphan blocks, without loosing money. But even if that's resolved, fees also prevent spam transactions and allow transactions to compete for inclusion in full blocks with financial incentives. You can get away with zero fee transactions under some circumstances, though.

Syncing the wallet is a complex task where you always have to make trade offs between the frequency and data amount needed to be synced from the server, and the complexity and thus possibility to introduce bugs into the mechanics trying to be smart in deciding what to keep and what to sync and how to mehr these information. When a sync of exchange rates finished for example, the views in transaction)history need to be updated as well etc etc. Thanks a lot for your detailed report, it is really helpful!

Mining equipment will do the same as now: calculate hashes for blocks which include transactions. Check transactions for validity and make them part of the blockchain. That's what they do now, they don't "calculate new coibs", they get rewarded new coins for finding valid blocks. Right now, they get a block reward of 25 coins plus the fees for all the transactions in the block. The block reward will get less and less, so the fees will probably be a bigger part of their earnings over time. Once the block reward gets rounded down to 0,all bitcoins will have been mined and it will be only the fees remaining as reward. But at that point, the block reward will have been pretty low and insignificant for decades already.

There are two different aspects - the bitcoin protocol and the software using it. The core client and the protocol overlap a lot, the core client is a reference implementation. There are things in the underlying algorithms which really cant go wrong. But software goes wrong all the time, and there are also some more high-level decisions which need correction. Let me give you an example: a block size limit was introduced to prevent data spam from being broadcasted to and stored by all the nodes. This is not a change to the basic underlying protocol, but its something coded in the reference client and somethign which came to network consensus, so right now if your node broadcasts a block bigger than 1 mb, everybody else will reject that block. As the network and transaction volume grew, we are now approaching a point where the size will not be enough ti handle all transactions in a timely manner. There are several ideas about how to increase the limit over time etc. In order to change this, we need to figure out which way is good and can get consensus. And how to change it, because if you just release a new version with doubled size limit, all the bigger blocks these new nodes create will get rejected by all the old nodes, causing some chaos for sure. Of course you can est stuff, but you cannot easily simulate the entire bitcoin network and behavior of node operators. Will they update or not? How fast? So all changes are applied while the bitcoin network does not stop running, and once some updates are out and people use the new versions, you cannot revert the state to some backup before the change. Thats why it is pretty tricky to get everything right, and thats why it is imho a very good idea to have a rather slow update cycle...

Not at all. The difference is super important. Money supply predictability is one of the key characteristics of bitcoin, and for fiat there simply is none. 
But if people go around saying fiat is inflationary, bitcoin is deflationary that might create the impression that the Bitcoin supply is decreasing. Which isn't true, we print more as well. Just at a rate known to everyone and not at the discretion of few people.

All HD accounts in mycelium will get derived from the same seed - that's considered a feature, cause you only ever need one backup. Your use case is a bit tricky - you could for example create HD paper wallets (using mycelium Entropy) and send your funds to them. Then either wipe app data, start and choose recover from backup to import your new seed, or maybe just use the cold spending feature to spend directly from the paper through scanning the seed. You could print a new one whenever you want to and use cold spending to send the funds over.

depends - when importing the 12 word list, trezor will still ask you for 24 words, and filling up the missing ones with random words. If the spyware is not aware of that, they will never get you seed, and if it is, it needs to figure out which 12 of the 24 intercepted to use in which order, at least.

Actually, the fact that the company mycelium isn't really earning money did not prevent him from getting a salary. I am pretty confident that the motivation for Jan wasn't the opportunity to get rich through working for "the big guys", but to start a project he was interested in doing. That's not to say your point is invalid! I just got offers with a slightly higher salary than what I earn at mycelium, so I wasn't tempted yet - but I guess there is a certain threshold somewhere. Then again, there are just some jobs I would be reluctant to do, no matter what the payment is - and so far coding for mycelium is exactly what I like, so I am fine, all in all.

Investing in bitcoin (= buying bitcoin) might be a good idea, but you should not listen to anybody telling you what to do with your money- take time to educate yourself and make the decision right for you specifically. Considering mining: don't do it. You will lose money. Its really really tough to make any money on mining at all, even with a huge budget, low energy costs, best connections to harware producers, and well trained people to maintain the miners. If you have to ask any questions about it at all, you are very very far from a point where it is even remotely likely that you will earn back the money you invest, let alone earn a compensation for the time you will need to invest.

It depends on how much you trust us and our security measures. The most secure approach is to audit the code on github and build from that yourself. But that requires coding knowledge, time, and is cumbersome. It's not trivial to perform this update attack though. An attacker would need to get access to the Google play store. Our personal Google accounts do not have the rights to upload a new apk. The account used for that has a strong password and two factor authentication. But even if someone got in, he would need a malicious apk signed with the correct key, otherwise it would not install on top of the original and would not be able to access the data like private keys. The key store files needed to make properly signed releases is stored offline on an encrypted device.

Basically, the word list is impossible to bruteforce.

I am one of the software guys, the hardware guys could probably give you more details. But its basically due to very slight differences in manufacturing like how exactly stuff is soldered, slight variances in voltage of the power supply via usb connector, different temperature etc. The quality of randomness decreases if the device is really really cold, for example.

It is a way to add your own randomness to the randomness generated by the device, and you can verify that its used along. So if you fear its backdoored or has poor randomness, you can make sure that doesnt lead to insecure funds, because there is no way to guess what you will add as randomness if you roll dice for it, for example.

It's in theory possible but very unlikely. If there was a bug / weakness in the way signatures are calculated, and you made a big number of transactions from a single address, it would become possible to crack the private key. The fact that you automatically use each address only once when using HD accounts heavily mitigates that risk. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:16:53
Yes, I am. Having it in parentheses probably wouldn't fit in one line quite often. I will try when I get back into office tomorrow. If I don't like it I'll try double line or cycle button. There will be something in 2.2 BETA 2. Did you see the current beta, by the way? We split the active section into two, "HD accounts" and "other", with total balance per section. What do you think about that? Would you like to have one total for HD (hot spending) accounts and one for all the imported watch only and singles (paper wallets...)? Or would you rather have a total over all active accounts no matter which type? 
@_date: 2015-02-18 10:41:18
It's just there to indicate it is syncing over tor. You don't need to keep refreshing. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:09:01
I am not sure I understand your question correctly. The HD accounts consist of multiple private keys, with new ones being generated while using them. We do not allow to export these keys directly, they are all handled internally for signing transactions (or messages). If you restore a backup, all private keys in all HD accounts get restored. With the next release we add the ability to export an HD accounts master public and private keys, xpub and xpriv. To say it simple: thats a master private key which can be used to restore an entire HD account with all its private keys.

There is nothing like a "cancel transaction" button, but it's possible and just a matter of someone coding the button. Once it got the first confirmation (when it's not shown as receiving but part of the balance) it's near impossible to revert. With higher number of confirmations, it's just getting even nearer to impossible. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 11:25:24
Correct. If everything works correctly, the new version will install on top of the old and keep all your data. But it's always better to assume something goes wrong and have a backup. The phone could get lost as well, and a backup could come in handy...

Right now, we just allow adding HD accounts based on the same seed. The need for other ones is rare, but they are dangerous. It's tough enough to get users to make backups in the first place. We really want their backup to work for all HD accounts to prevent them from misunderstanding and losing money. Firmware for mycelium Entropy which allows creation of single HD accounts is being prepared, though. Once ME ships, you could use it to create single independent HD accounts, print them right off the USB device and import them into mycelium from paper. You will then have a backup for this special account on the paper. You could also import it as watch only.

I guess the question was answered in general. If you want to know details, check the according Bitcoin Improvement Proposals.

It even takes quite some time for me to go through all of the steps required for a release - and I have access to the devices, passwords, etc :) We consider implementing a deterministic build process, so that it becomes easy to verify that the version on google play was built from exactly the code published on github. But that is a difficult task, and I don't know when we get around to make it work. Its primarily to show that we developers do not trick you, but would of course cause the alarm bells ringing if someone else would upload a malicious update as well, as a neat side effect.

You can import addresses or xpub keys to have watchonly addresses or watchonly hd accounts. If you want to spend from them, use the cold storage feature or just the scan button to scan the private key / xpriv / master seed and spend from them. You can try everything using testnet if you want to.

Actually, testnet is also good for users. Instead of relying on backups to work etc without trying, or instead of losing money while playing around to figure stuff out, you can just get a testnet version and try. Install mycelium for testnet, get free coins from the local trader bot, and try. You can learn how to send around, make backups, restore backups etc without risking real money.
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:49:36
It does not generate new accounts from random seeds, they are all derived from the same master seed. If you want to restore, you need a fresh install of mycelium. Upon first start it will ask you whether to generate a need seed or restore one from backup. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 09:20:42
If you don't trust the developers, you have to review the source code (or have someone you trust do it) and then compile the wallet from source (or verify it was compiled from that source, if it supports deterministic builds). 
@_date: 2015-02-06 09:34:50
Because people use the tertms "wallet", "account", "address", "key" very differently, it would be useful to know exactly what you experience. Basically, if you use the same seed in both devices, all HD accounts should be equal. In mycelium on Android, thats the account which gets generated automatically and has default name "Account 1" and all other added HD accounts (those with the multiple key icon). The balance you see is not the balance of the receiving address you see (the balance on that address is always 0, since its a fresh one you can use to receive coins without leaking your transaction history), its the balance of the selected account (all addresses in that account combined). If the account is showing less keys (info line under the name in accounts tab) or another balance than on iOS, please try to use the "rescan account" function from the accounts action bar menu.

Are those by chance matching the unspent outputs? If you go to accounts tab, select the account, and from the menu "show unspent outputs" you see how your coins are distributed over the addresses in your HD account. They are either the amounts of incoming transactions, or the change amounts from outgoing ones. Maybe the local cache forgot all transactions but those which created unspent outputs in your wallet.... I will check that.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:03:25
Yes, miners are completely free to choose which transactions they want to include. The blocks will get rejected by other miners if they include invalid transactions. But they could choose to not include transactions for or from specific addresses, include only such with high fee, only small ones... as they please. The fee is not explicitly stated somewhere, it's just the difference between the sum of inputs and the sum of outputs. If you have two inputs 2btc each, have one output with 3btc (which you want to send)  and one output with 0.9999 BTC (the change you send to yourself) the fee will be 0.0001 BTC. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 11:36:31
The optional passphrase actually isn't a 25th word, it's an addition to the salt for the algorithm used to derive the seed from the words. We already support it, when you select restore backup on a fresh install you can select the word list length and tick a box to provide optional passphrase.

I see. But I am pretty sure the current coin selector in combination with the HD nature of the wallet is pretty good already. It does of course depend on your spending patterns, but in the case where you mostly top up from a cold storage and then spend for some time, the vast majority of the transactions does just have one input anyway. In the other cases, usually just two or three addresses can be linked together, and they all have just been used once, and its not obvious which output of the transaction is the payment and which one the change in most times. I bet many people trying to manage this manually would accidentally perform worse, it might seem good to just use a single big input, but instead of creating some hard to analyze two-address-clusters they might connect _all_ the addresses with each other unknowingly when they empty the wallet or ar forced to combine all the small remaining outputs for a payment. I do see your point, but I would argue that for those cases where its super important or where you are especially concerned it is okay to expect you to use a full featured desktop client instead of the mobile "on the go" wallet. What do have on our (very long) list for "some time" is to provide different output selector modes, like "fee oriented" to select old outputs, "garbage collection" to combine dust, "privacy" to use as few unspent outputs as possible... but as with most features, our team is mall, the list is long, there is no ETA...

Yep, we are earning so few with local trader, it does not really matter if we remove the fee. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 06:23:05
Thanks, good to hear we do not disappoint!

some people rather have a 24 meter thick wall to protect them, instead of a 12 meter thick one, even if nobody is going to get through the latter anyway :)

Thanks for your love and money!

Could you give more details about your problem? Where does the seed not get accepted? With which error? Where does the seed come from? 
@_date: 2015-02-11 10:27:23
Yes, we used to state its open source because everybody can see all the source and even use it, except for the UI. We just dont want others to distribute a version which looks exactly the same. If its faulty or backdoored, it will hurt our reputation and / or increase our support expenses. But many people correctly pointed out that most definitions of "open source" take the license into account and expect the full project to be freely re-distributable and so on. So I changed my wording to "public for inspection" which does not cause uncertainties or discussions and still gets the most important point across. Here it is, by the way:

Hmm, maybe I should add my personal cold storage address to the address book per default...

It's not profitable at all, we barely earn anything yet. It's completely privately funded at this moment.

Active installs is 40k, if I interpret the numbers correctly (currently on via my mobile)

I'll pass the question on to firmware developers. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 10:30:04
We will just remove the fees, just in case, even if its not what triggered the suspension. Maybe the word "fee" in the changelog triggered a manual review (because we said you can adjust transaction fee from send dialog with the new version) and some guy just clicked "suspend" without deep investigation cause he thought we collect a fee from users for sending transactions. We will hopefully find out soon.

I guess this ad is a bit like the magic internet money wizard on reddit, half of the people seem to love it, the others feel like it's childish and stupid. The ad isn't the only thing out there concerning mycelium, just as the wizard isn't the only impression people get about bitcoin on reddit. Thanks for your honest feedback, though. I guess it will take quite some time till there is a new ad anyway. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:16:31
Thanks for the nice words, its always good to hear that what we do pleases others :)
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:26:02
I can at least promise you that we will discuss it. What's the reasoning? You don't use any screen lock and don't want someone to see the balance of your selected account? 
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:23:33
The security is pretty good, your PIN protects all critical operations. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 06:13:44
Okay, I understand. As a workaround you can select an empty watch only and lock the accounts screen with your PIN. We will discuss addition of a setting to make the PIN required to open! 
@_date: 2016-05-18 13:14:42
Yeah, of course uncertainty is priced in. And you are either uncertain as well, at approximately the same level than others, or you are currently seeling everything and taking loans to buy bitcoin and make a sure 10% on that money. Right?
@_date: 2016-07-05 12:37:46
Good job indeed.

They are not reversed or refunded, they do not happen in the first place. The fact that your wallet shows them as gone for some time does not change this, its just a visualization of your wallet expecting those transactions to actually happen. Everybody who accepts 0 conf transactions has a responsibility to make sure that its very likely those transactions will happen. Checking the fee is a regular part of "making sure", just as checking for mutated version, number of nodes the transaction is known to, etc.

There is no desktop wallet by mycelium. I don't know electrum personally, but from all I hear it's a good choice. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 21:27:56
What we did is we contacted Google via the provided form. Solving the problem is not the tough part, we will happily remove a donate option or the local trader fee. We just need to know what caused the problem... 
@_date: 2015-02-18 17:47:33
Thanks!
