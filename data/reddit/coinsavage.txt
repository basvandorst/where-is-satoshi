Don’t worry... enjoy your high... try again tmrw and let us know if you need help... glad you checked us out. ��

The service is free and anyone joining now will be grandfathered into the service if we ever started charging. The TOS still reflects a plan to charge eventually (cause we got to pay api costs) but again it’s free now. $1 a month is pretty in line with the industry, if you’re familiar with the Acorns app they are ACH debiting for about that amount. But again, we aren’t stealth charging anyone, our TOS reflects an eventual need to charge.

Haha yeah that would suck... but that’s not how the service works. Spare change is accumulated up to a certain amount at which point a purchase is initiated so that fees are kept down.
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:02:28
Yep... go ahead.
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:21:14
No worries, thanks for checking us out.

For John and his d... let’s do this bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-11-30 16:26:38
What? ... you roundup into bitcoin... nothing to do with BCH other than being a different option
@_date: 2019-11-02 23:57:43
... RoundlyX... Acorns of crypto
@_date: 2019-11-30 16:28:37
So is bitcoin...what’s your point?

If you’re using the service in the U.K. then we want your feedback if able... hello
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:23:20
You would incur exchange purchase fees once all the spare change you've accumulated triggers an actual buy at a certain level... for example, it's been a couple weeks and you accumulated $50 in spare change triggering a buy order... you then pay the fee to Coinbase to buy the crypto. This is optimal given the way Coinbase charges fees. Similar to the way all roundup services work.
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:18:12
That’s what this service does
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:10:02
Haha no you’re very special ��
@_date: 2019-08-25 12:45:03
No transfer fees. You have to be old enough to read, understand, and consent to the terms of use.
@_date: 2019-08-24 14:15:42
Confused? It’s like the acorns app but for crypto... roundups into Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:31:41
If you’re still using physical fiat all the time then no this isn’t for you
@_date: 2019-08-25 12:45:46
Way more crypto assets available than Bundil
@_date: 2019-08-24 20:43:52
But remember you get access to more assets at RoundlyX.com
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:16:23
We don’t charge right now... we did put what we eventually plan on charging in our Terms of Service to be more transparent about our plans... after plaid fees and processor payments our costs are close to a dollar so that’s what we plan on charging later. Also most roundup services for different asset classes charge a $1 for the same reason. When we start to charge it won’t just happen... existing users will have to opt in so it’s free until then and then you will have the option to stick with the service if you like. 
We have a trigger level to keep fees down at the exchange (optimizing Coinbase fee structure). We plan to add more lower cost exchanges this year but started with the largest ie Coinbase.
More questions?
This is more about creating an easy way for people to get started/savings tool in crypto... helps the whole ecosystem gain adoption.
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:28:24
Most folks prefer a passive set it and forget it way to continually buy... maybe it’s not for you but it’s a step forward for mainstream crypto adoption

At Coinseed you don’t actually hold crypto... it’s fiat then switched out when you sell it... that’s why you can’t transfer bitcoin from Coinseed ... $45 was the threshold to optimize around the Coinbase fee structure (an attempt to help users)... now that they’ve added Voyager exchange the trigger will drop
@_date: 2019-12-20 19:35:56
Yeah so all your crypto always stays in your exchange account when purchased... RoundlyX was built to not have permission to move your crypto (you have to do that the usual way in your exchange account)... right now the $45 purchase happens all at the same time (you see it accumulate little by little bit no money moves until it hits $45)... $45 has the best level given the Coinbase fees but soon they will roll out a lower trigger level since the newest exchange they added (Voyager) has zero fees so it will eventually have a lower trigger than $45

before commenting, please read the article... hint: it's pro bitcoin
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:43:04
That’s why we like this community... just wanted to make sure people weren’t turned off
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:48:50
A few billion $ from a nation state worried about capital outflows isn't much (in their view)... How expensive? Targeting the top contributors with payoffs and blackmail isn't outside of the playbook. What is the community doing to hedge this risk? 
I'm long but we should think about this kind of thing.
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:13:43
The thought being that the bigger Bitcoin gets and therefore the more of a threat to the status quo it becomes, that the community figures out a way of guaranteeing this isn't a possibility?? Because we need to...
We can't become a truly global reserve without a guarantee that this can't happen... its just not good because you can't have a stable financial system if the security benefits of Bitcoin blockchain can be usurped by centralized dev leaders. Someone needs to create a mechanism beyond human reviewers... I don't know what that solution is but I'm also far from the smartest person interested in Bitcoin... so maybe someone sees this post and thinks up a solution
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:53:27
Thanks for the responses... but seems your saying no chance of a catastrophic zero day exploit from malicious devs?? I just think of all the zero day exploits in Windows
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:18:20
gives positives and negatives of the current crypto market led by Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:01:56
Right... but isn't there a balance to that at some point? Bitcoin enemies are more threatened the more successful Bitcoin becomes...it will attract creative means of attack outside of cyberspace to circumvent the security of the decentralized blockchain... the dev community is a target, and a vector of attack... I can be a Bitcoin believer AND bring up issues like this
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:35:10
My point isn't whether they would KNOWINGLY put malicious code onto their Node... no one would do that... not trying to spread uncertainty just pointing out a risk that the community would be smart to seriously consider and start thinking of a potential solution
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:54:59
thanks for the reply... wanted to make our convo easier to see so I posted a reply to the original post... If able, reply there so everyone has the benefit seeing your reply easily

Terrible news, hope the trader is okay... if you've been around long enough you've overextended once or twice and got lucky by not having it go against you... we will see if we hold the ascending trend line at ~$6800 on BTC, if not the next level is $5900... I'm a longterm holder just follow the technicals to understand the moves... feel like we see 5900 because still have yet to feel a swoosh down capitulatory move

I think they could definitely go that route (some kind of government/fiat backed coin), which would NOT add to the diversity of the SDR basket. In the article, did you agree with the need for the SDR to HEDGE fiat with non-fiat assets like Bitcoin?

typical boom and bust cycle... starting to emerge from bust into optimism 
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:49:21
Exactly
