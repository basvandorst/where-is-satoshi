Most are entering with ICO’s, and ICO raised fund dumping back to market are not good ��

It’s a normal 3rd party brokerage firm, What’s your thoughts for the question?
@_date: 2018-09-22 08:15:28
Affirmative bro! As we all know; whale wallets &amp; btc whales are main cause of it. ;)
@_date: 2018-09-22 09:31:54
I’ll mark later ;)

Bro; I should insert more line, if btc dominance decreases; it will ease altcoin dominance &amp; price appreciation. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 11:52:04
Thinkers table always messy bro ��

They’re valuable triggering altseason!

Bitcoin is good; only if bitcoin whale wallet owners become identified &amp; make a pledge that not to manipulate the markets. 
Bitter truth &amp; strong fear for bitcoin small investors/community.

I think you are the one who lost bulk in the game lol ����
@_date: 2018-09-22 09:25:01
Majority of smart money play only with btc that’s why maybe. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 08:13:38
But problem is btc whale wallet are getting operated time to time, may be whales want more time to kickout small minners from the pitch!

Hahah thanks for briefing your character, I won’t take revenge, I’ve many things to enjoy ��

Nice to hear your question bro; 
Btc price = btc M. Cap / btc circulating supply, while btc dominance obtained by total Coin market Cap. 
Therefore, whether market Cap go up/down, btc dominance will obtained by total percentage of btc volume against Coin market Cap.

In both cases; whales &amp; protraders are making bulk of money in shorting/arbitrage.

Well! Wake up- fiat money is scam not bitcoin, fiat is followed Fractional reserved banking; bitcoin doesn’t, that’s why reserve banks of globe trying their hard to proof btc a scam, and that’s why MasterCard appeal for Fractional reserve bitcoin? Why baktt postponed its launch dates? 
I analyse this chart only with dates prediction- if you only knew the mean of 9. Thanks
