Where do I buy bit coin or what do I need yo have to obtain bit coins? I only have a regular computer, do I need to buy stuff?

This comment might get ignored but I've been wanted to buy some because I don't trust the dollar and can't afford gold (or really use it as currency) so with this getting popular should I be taking it serious now or because of popularity will it become cheaper to buy later?
Sorry I legitimately just wanna talk to someone who truly understands bitcoin.

So if I Google that its all pretty self explanatory and easy?

Thing is, I don't even know how to buy. I went to circle quickly while I was at work and it was bank account linking? I gotta find a 'bitcoin for dummies'. Its not that I can't Google things and read I just trust more having a conversation with someone

Yeah I need to actually sit down and read but I'd still like to talk to someone who already has the details.
I think I didn't explain correctly though that my concern isn't with if it will increase or decrease in value just because... But moreso that with any currency... If it actually gets USED that technically means its *worth* more but in terms of comparison to another currency, doesn't it have to so with how much is in circulation?
Lots of factors. I want to buy some regardless. I don't know how.

Thank you for the heads up! I'm not looking to mess up.

Maybe this itself is an attempt to scare people from using bitcoin.
