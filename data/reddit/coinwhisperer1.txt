yussir. if you are to look at the patterns over the course of the last year and how bitcoin prices responded to forks/ introduction of heavily backed alts, this drop is in line with previous drops.
bitcoin is being threatened, but it isnt under any real threat. in fact i think this drop is the result of a market manipulation by the same big fish who backed s2x and walked off with huge profits on other alts (bitcash namely) after the fork was cancelled.
point being i think the big fish who are responsible for this mini-crisis didnt do it in an attempt to take out bitcoin (which im sure they realize is impossible), it was to make a profit on the short term drop that they manufactured. these fish dont have an allegiance to the alts, they have an allegiance to profit- and they will be putting their money in bitcoin during the coming uptick knowing its going to skyrocket. (i hope- but yes i dont know shit)

I'm in agreement. 10k by end of November. once this mini crisis is proven to be what it is, confidence will be re-instated -&gt; those waiting for it to drop more will jump back in all at once -&gt;bunch of big fish who are on edge will be given assurance by the bounce back and jump in. I see this fluctuation around 7k like a spring being loaded up. Once it jumps back it's like that spring is being let go and we're going to see a fast paced rise towards 10k (and then another mini-crisis, and so on and so forth)
I don't know wtf I'm talking about

Patience my friend.
Bitcoin is under attack right now but its foundations aren't threatened. The people jumping ship will find out that they abandoned the only crypto with long-term majority market share and continuous growth. Attacks like these will only go to show bitcoins resilience and permanence. 
Edit: no, no I can't link u to said chart
