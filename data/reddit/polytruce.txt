Coinzark is kyc free and works much like how shapeshift used to.

I drove by this place last week and thought about posting it myself! 
Do you happen to know what exchange they use for their price? Or their premium?

Should we tell him?

I know that feel. 
Verthash is on the horizon though, who knows if it'll be the kick in the pants VTC needs. I put $200 into it the other day to be prepared just in case.

Not sure what this has to do with cypto, investing, or really bitcoin at all since none of the three are mentioned even in passing in the article. 
But yes, college age students are much poorer than most people tend to realize. Not much you can do with 50 bucks a month after rent and food, plus the average expenses of being young and inexperienced with money. Add to that the fact that tuition is being raised nearly every year by relatively significant margins, degrees are becoming paradoxically more important to have while becoming less valuable simultaneously, and you're simply up shit creek without a paddle.  
If you want to really make it big, get into the business of higher education. You'll make a killing off the next generation in the current climate, and nobody can be bothered to even look at you cross-eyed let alone do anything about it.

It depends on how your PC is compromised, but I would highly recommend that you consider the PC as "public" at this point, and remove all sensitive documents/data from the PC. I would wipe the drive and reinstall your OS, then take steps to ensure you don't have any personality identifiable information being put on the PC in the future. 
As others have said, I would also highly recommend a cold storage method. A ledger/trezor is the gold standard, but similar setups can be achieved with a PC with no internet access, or an old phone without service. Essentially, try to find a way to store your cryto that requires the sender to physically interact with the storage method, as opposed to having a possible route of entry through an internet connection or otherwise.

I'm right there with you. I was getting ready before bed when I did a price check on a whim and almost spit out my drink. I hadn't checked the price since I bought on monday.

If you're trading it back into crypto, then I would absolutely recommend a stablecoin just because it'll be faster. No waiting for ACH to clear.

The keys that everyone is talking about are the keys to the wallet where the bitcoin is being stored. 
Unless you are in possesion of said keys, the bitcoin contained within is not your bitcoin. 
Using a wallet like Bitcoin Core or a cold wallet like ledger/trezor ensures that it is your bitcoin and no one else's.

Gold also has industrial uses, so having a larger supply would be beneficial to some.

Hold on to your hats boys.
