I'm in a similar spot.  I remember when Bitcoin was worth $3.  I was really excited by the concept of Bitcoin so I spent a few evenings trying to figure out how to mine but couldn't figure it out so I eventually got frustrated and gave up.  
I don't lose any sleep over it though.  I know myself and know that at that point in my life when I was a broke recent graduate, I would have sold everything at like $5-$6 and would have been pumped! No way I would have had the discipline at that time to be able to HODL anywhere near $50, $100, $1000 etc
Now I just keep slowly investing on a regular basis and HODL!

Thanks for the reply.  Will try this in ~30 minutes and will report back.  Assuming it works then the $10 is yours.

Happy to report that I spoke with user DarkLord_GMS and he was able to push the transactions through for me!

Got an error saying "submissions are beyond limit, try again later"
Does that mean it already hit the 100 transaction limit?

How many days (minutes?) til we hit 11k?

Don't feel so bad.  I remember when they cost $12 and I didn't buy.  The only thing that lets me sleep at night is that I know I would have never held this long.  Even if I had bought at $12 I would have sold at $15.
