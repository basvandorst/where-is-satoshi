Do. Not. Try. To. Time. The. Market. If you're not dropping thousands of dollars at once just buy in every week.

Please remember all of the NYA signers. They're bad people, not to be trusted, nor their actions forgotten.

Really gross, man. Money isn’t worth doing that to yourself. Some how I don’t think Satoshi had this in mind. Good luck.

Kraken is a giant waste of time. I’m a moderator at CryptoMarkets and I regularly tell people to stop using them. They seemingly have no desire to improve their hardware, so when there’s a lot of market activity their service (if you could call it that) just crashes.

Understood. Good luck in the future. I’m glad the crisis was averted.

In the east. Donbass is nearly eight hours away from Kyiv, and all if you knew anything about the country (or had visited), you would know how eerily normal life is in Kyiv.

The New York Agreement signers conspired to act against Bitcoin - and thus users all over the world - for nothing more than financial gain. They're bad people, and deserve to be reminded of it time and time again.

Visited Kyiv a number of times. I’ve been taking Russian and Ukrainian lessons for the last six months. Moving to a Kyiv in January to live. Cost of living is great, middle of Europe, and Ukraine is a good country. It’ll catch on.

GDAX needs to allow use by larger countries and their citizens, primarily Australia.

These are valid reasons to withdraw your funds/coins and move your business elsewhere. I hope it's solved for you soon, OP (and others).

They only take fiat but I recommend ‘Duke’s Coffee Roasters’ on Flinders Lane. 
Get in touch if you’d like to meet with a local/need any help during your time here

It’s $3.00. I spend $5.00 AUD on coffee in the morning. I guess it’s all relative. I can understand why it might be a turn off for some people. Thank you for your comment. ��

Just wanted to comment and say this is a great initiative. Nice way to involve the community.
My input would be that it's donated to the EFF or another partner organisation.

Are you Ukrainian?

You're the MVP, Charlie. Keep it real.

I don’t understand the complaining about ‘fees’. Every time I’ve used Coinbase (~$250 week) I do not see the fees as being excessive and I think I paid a few bucks. Am I missing something?

Your comment is misleading. The Reddit user is studying software design, and wishes to learn more about Blockchain development.

Guys like Cuban are the worst; shit on something until it’s convenient, then jump onboard. These are the people you must not trust. They’re the problem with society now, and will be a problem until all of us hold them accountable for their lies, unethical behaviours, and more.
