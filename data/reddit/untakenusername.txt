I'm not a bitcoin expert, but as I understand it is that if the number of miners drop (because of it not being profitable, say) the difficulty drops, too, meaning it's easier to mine (which would encourage more miners because it takes less work). 
Also, there's a mining fee, so miners could just demand a higher fee to compensate for a lower profitability on the reward. 
In any event, we will get to see this play out in minutia in July 2016 when the block reward is halved. That will mean miners are rewarded with half as many coins so something will have to compensate for this change (higher miner fee, fewer miners, higher BTC price, or some combination of the above). 
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:00:42
Hrm, so you won't take a professional who works in the system as the standard bearer for what is harebrained or not *within the system in question*.
Certainly you'd have to take the opinion of a Federal judge, right, since they are the ones tasked with interpreting the law?
Again, I don't know this lady's views on why she doesn't owe taxes, but a common one is that people don't owe income tax because the 16th amendment was never properly ratified. I'd call that harebrained because there have been numerous court cases where that argument was nullified. So to continue to believe that it's a valid reason when there is direct evidence to the contrary is harebrained, no?

Which is why people can "mail in the keys" for a house underwater.
If you buy a house for, say, $500,000 and then the market crashes at its value plummets to $250,000, there's a strong economic incentive to just mail the keys to the lender and find someplace else to live to escape the $500,000 monthly nut.
Of course, this only applies for states that require non-recourse home mortgages. Second mortgages and lines of equity are not non-recourse, so they'll come after you for the balances.

The Fed was created by an act of Congress. 
It's powers are derived from Congress. 
It is required (by Congress) to be not-for-profit. 
It is required (by Congress) to invest any profits into T-bills. 
It is required (by Congress) to have annual audits by the Federal government. 
The Chair of the Fed is nominated by the President and approved by the Senate.
It is very far from being a private banking cartel.
But, yes, it's incorrect to equate the Fed with the US government, although if push comes to shove the US government can always nationalize the Federal banking system.
And, yes, the US government does have gold holdings. According to [this source]( they hold roughly 3% of all of the gold ever mined in the history of humanity and the government's holdings are only second to the Feds.

What if there's a negative balance? What if you bought the house for $500,000 but the bank could only sell it for $250,000? Are you on the hook for the remainder? If you aren't then it's no different than non-recourse loans in the US. If you are on the hook then it's akin to recourse loans, which some states allow.
In one respect, mailing back the keys does seem wrong because when you bought the mortgage you are made to feel like you're giving your word that you'll keep paying till it's paid off. You'd be a dick to promise a friend you'd pay back a loan and then just shaft them later.
But on the other hand, the paperwork you sign with the bank does explicitly lay out that the house is the bank's only collateral and that the mortgage holder does have the option to return the collateral and cancel the debt obligation without any recourse. So the bank's aren't jumping into this solution with their eyes wide shut.

The dollar has value because there are billions of people who will exchange my dollars for some good or service they produce. 
I don't understand why gold has value other than everyone agrees it does. Granted, it has some industrial use and cosmetic use in jewelry, but if someone gave me the option of receiving $100 worth of Bitcoin or $100 of gold today with the understanding that I couldn't sell or trade it for 10 years I'd take Bitcoin. It could very well be worth $0 in 10 years, but if it catches on as a store of value it cohd be worth a lot more given its limited supply. 
My point is that if gold can be considered a store of value even though it has no practical value today, why can't the same happen to bitcoin? I grant you the probability is low, maybe even close to zero, but the upside is high. 
All that to say, to me, bitcoin is interesting as a store of value. I don't want to use it as a currency myself, there's too much friction and pain to do so for me. But I'm an old fart.

Have you read any of Nassim Taleb's books, *The Black Swan*, *Fooled By Randomness,* and so on?
In any event, the guy made his fortunate in finance and FWIW his investment strategy is to invest in things that have a low floor and an extremely high ceiling. So putting down a small percentage of his investments in something that might go to $0, but there is a small chance it could go 100x or 1,000x or whatever.
That's how I'm viewing Bitcoin. I have a very modest and "traditional" set of investments - S&amp;P 500 index fund, bond fund, etc. - that gets ~$3,000 a month from my wife and I in the form of 401(k). I figure putting in 1-2% of my monthly investments into bitcoin would be similar to Taleb's approach. (He might be laughing if he read this, of course.) But the idea is that, yeah, I could lose all of the 1-2%, or have it not appreciate much at all, but there is that low, but outside chance it could grow radically given its deflationary nature.
We'll see. I'm a pretty conservative and prudent investor, so this is why this move is both exciting and nerve racking to me. :-)

I remember first hearing about bitcoin back when it was in the mid-$100 range or so, but it seemed so hard to buy. (I don't have a smart phone, for instance, so I wasn't sure - still am not - how easy/possible/safe it would be to buy coins locally. I guess you'd have to just show up with an address/QR code printed out and trust that it went through?)
The whole marketplace for buying it online seemed so sketchy back then, so I just decided to sit on the sidelines and read about it and learn more. Then seeing the meteoric rise to $1,200 (or whatever) and part of me was kicking myself for not buying earlier, while part of me was thinking this was a bubble and would crash to $0. 
I've been enjoying the Bitcoin-related podcasts on Econtalk and decided to check out xapo and coinbase after hearing about them in one podcast. Ended up going with coinbase, was pretty straightforward and leaves me feeling like it's a safe place to share my information.
In any event, I think it's a fantastical experiment that really has the opportunity to change the world. Or it could remain a niche product. Or it could implode, who knows? In any event, I'm excited to now own coins, trying to decide if I should keep them on coinbase or transfer them to a cold wallet. I plan on just buying a holding, I am going to use it like a store of value rather than as a currency.
My plan is to dollar cost average and buy a bit a month, maybe $50 or $100. Enough to be part of the experiment with money I can afford to lose, with the hope that bitcoin is able to take off and become and important monetary force in the world.

The word "bank" has specific legal meanings. From [Wikipedia](




So looking at the names on the left you'll see there are plenty of non-bank entities, e.g., Summit Bancorp, UJB Financials, Bear Sterns, and so on. These are investment companies, not commercial bankers where they accept deposits from Joe Schmoe.
And, yes, the repeal of Glass-Stegall is what permitted commercial banks and investment banks to operate under the same umbrella and for these investment arms to use commercial bank deposits to underwrite their investing. Without Glass-Stegall a number of these mergers wouldn't have been permissible or made any economic sense. But after the repeal it makes sense for such mergers because commercial banks can make riskier (e.g., more profitable) investments with their deposits and investment companies now have more capital to work with and therefore can make bigger investments.
@_date: 2016-02-26 16:12:27
Personally, I think it is a useful store of value (i.e., digital gold). But the case one can make against that is that there's no inherent value in bitcoin, just the value assigned to it by other buyers and sellers in the marketplace. And therefore, if there is a panic or people lose "faith" in bitcoin, there's nothing stopping it from dropping in value to $0. (Whereas with gold even if everyone agreed tomorrow that it was a horrible hedge/asset to hold from a financial perspective, it would still have a non-zero value because it has industrial and jewelry-related uses.)
And there are some limited currency use cases, such as making cash-like purchases over the Internet. But those are (relatively) uncommon and usually skew to the illegal side of things.

Just like how dog food is still edible and will provide you with calories, but it's just not what anyone would want to have for dinner.
Personally, I've always thought of Bitcoin as digital gold because it's utility as e-cash is limited to very narrow use cases. And those use cases become even narrower with a restrained blocksize.
But arguably Bitcoin was a viable e-cash at one point. It's not that today. (Technically still e-cash, just like dog food is technically edible.) Today it works as digital gold. But tomorrow?
And these are just my thoughts on the matter. Others would argue it never was a suitable e-cash. And others would contend it's still an excellent e-cash today. All that to say, when someone (like OP) asks, "What is Bitcoin," the answer depends quite a bit on who you ask!

I've been following bitcoin since before the 2013 runup and bought my first bitcoin a few months ago.
In the past it seemed (to me) that you needed to meet someone in person or wire money to some foreign exchange or find an out of the way bitcoin ATM to buy any. But with places like circle and coinbase it seems a lot easier/safer to buy bitcoin. Easy and safe enough that non-technical people could do it.
Point being, it's pretty easy to buy these days, so come on in! :-)

Interestingly, in pre Industrial Revolution Europe, many prostitutes would avoid pregnancy by having their clientele not actually penetrate them, but rather they'd push their thighs together, use some lubricating substance, and then the guy would go to town between their thighs. 
Since having a vagina was, therefore, not requires, there were men who would dress up in drag and sell their thighs for sexual use to interested customers. 
All that to say, on Bitcoin Island the free market would undoubtably attract thousands of entrepreneurial men to dress in drag and stock up on Crisco.

Have you ever read of a civil forfeiture of electronic funds? All the cases I've read about it's been a person pulled over by the cops who had a large amount of cash on hand. It's an issue because the cops can take the cash and basically say, "You have to prove this is yours in court and then you get this back."
In your scenario, you have the funds in a bank. The only way the government could get that money out of your bank is if they had a court order. So they'd have to go to court and get a judge to agree that there's sufficient evidence to warrant such an action. Which is infinitely less likely than some cop doing a road stop and seeing $10,000 of cash in the trunk of a beatup car and taking the cash because he thinks it was from the sale of drugs.
Long story short, you're overthinking this. Your money is safe.

It would only be a useful complement if people are trading it bitcoins already. No one is buying anything from me with bitcoins, I am not paid in bitcoins, etc., so if I wanted to go buy something from a vendor who accepted bitcoins I'd first have to transfer cash into bitcoins... which is now more work (and higher cost) than using cash.
Now, if I were paid in BTC or was exchanging goods and services for BTC then, sure, it would be a useful analog. But personally most people aren't going to be trading among one another in BTC when cash will suffice, and I don't think we'll ever see a major employer offer to pay their employees in BTC.

I am someone who has read a bit about bitcoin over the past year but doesn't own any.

But as you noted earlier, *nothing* has intrinsic value in the most literal sense. I may value oxygen very highly, but it's all subjective. That anaerobic bacterium over there could care less about it.
But if we back away from that pedantry we can agree (I hope?) that gold has more "intrinsic value" - not in the most literal sense, granted - than BTC or paper dollars, at least in our society and at our point technologically.
Here's another way to think about it... say tomorrow no one assigned any *implicit value* to gold or to paper dollars. What would each be worth? Would they be worthless? No, they'd both have utility, paper dollars as kindle for a fire, or wallpaper or other such things, and gold as the industrial uses I cited earlier. (Sure, that value would be limited on a desert island, but our society doesn't live on a desert island.)
Now what about bitcoins? There is zero value aside from the value we agree to assign it as a medium of exchange. Gold and paper still have real world value external to the value society assigns it as a currency.
That is my point.

Fiat money beat out commodity money for a variety of reasons. 
Transactional costs are certainly one, another is that fiat money allows the money supply to be grown and shrunk in response to economic conditions. Commodity money can cause major problems when there are hiccups to the expected discovery rate (either no new reserves discovered for a long time or a very large find discovered).

Correct, but it's open source so anyone can freely evaluate the code.


Agreed, but it exponentially increases the chances that someone will find flaw(s) if they exist.


Do you agree that adoption is a necessary condition to bitcoin's success? 
You may not think it sufficient, but until a shortcoming has been proven then I'd argue that adoption is both necessary and sufficient. Yes, a shortcoming in the algorithm would make adoption not a sufficient condition for bitcoin's success, but if you argue that bitcoin can't succeed until it's been proven faultless then it will never succeed. But the same thing could be said about many other complex systems we rely on every day.

Can you elaborate on why it is your preferred way of buying things? 
To a person who is interested in BTC but who does not own any it seems like a terribly inefficient way to buy things. Why convert dollars to BTC to make a purchase, where the purchaser then takes those BTCs and converts them back to dollars. Why add a whole layer on top of the transaction?
I get buying things in BTC is great if you need purchasing anonymity online or if you bought coins prior to the runup, but other than those cases I don't see the allure of using BTC as a currency.

Right, but the bitcoins in and of themselves have no value. That's what's so neat about living in the digital age.


I feel like we are going around in circles here. My point is that there is inherent value - albeit socially constructed due to the society and times we live in - in gold and paper products. Sure, gold is worthless on a desert island just like oxygen is worthless to an anaerobic bacterium. But if we limit ourselves to talking about the value in modern society then gold and paper and oxygen all have intrinsic value.
But the bitcoins themselves - the 1s and 0s - those have no intrinsic value in our modern society.

I agree that in the most literal and pedantic sense nothing has true intrinsic value - not even food or water, which might be valuable to you but not to an alien who metabolizes food differently.
But if we are comparing gold and BTC it's obtuse to say, "Techincally, neither of them have any intrinsic value."

I think we are talking about two different things due to my word choice.
I think you are interpreting my use of the word "worthless" as "worth (space) less," in that if you were to take a dollar and a bitcoin today, "buy them" and wait 5/10/25 years and then unearth them, which would be worth less then that it is today. In that regard I agree that USD will be worth less (presuming bitcoins are worth anything) due to the inflationary and deflationary nature of USD and bitcoins, respectively.
But I meant the term "worthless" as having no value whatsoever. Take that dollar and bitcoin and bury it and 5/10/25 years hence I think there is a slim but real chance that no one in the world will accept your bitcoin as a medium of exchange for goods and services whereas there is virtually zero chance that no one in the world will accept that dollar.
@_date: 2013-05-08 19:34:32

@_date: 2013-08-05 01:51:54

Beanie babies went up in value non stop for some period of time before collapsing. Ditto tulips in the Netherlands back in the 17th century. I'm not saying that bitcoins are a bubble, just that only having a few years worth of data is not at all sufficient to make any sort of long term prediction.
And a big reason USD is valued as it is is because the government is always going to pay in that denomination and is always going to accept USD as payment for debts, taxes, fines &amp; fees, etc. So everyone from the guy on welfare who's getting food stamps to all of the employees and vendors of any company that has government contracts is going to value USD. (To say nothing of foreign countries who get financial aid from the US or who trade with our government, etc.)
So will bitcoin be worthless 5 or 10 or 25 years hence? I don't think so, but I think the likelihood that BTC is worthless 5 or 10 or 25 years hence is considerably higher than the likelihood that USD is worthless. Do you disagree?

I've never used SR, nor have I ever owned any BTC, but I've been interested in it for about a year now. I remember reading articles in 2012 about how the price of BTC on MtGox would have daily highs (typically) during certain windows which were presumed to be the time of day much of the US would be buying drugs on SR. 
As BTC has matured I'd presume less and less of the market is on SR, but I know that back in the early days it was SR and similar dark web sites that constituted a significant proportion of the BTC exchange market.

@_date: 2013-04-03 22:16:47
Not quite. The FDIC is not there to ensure that if there is a bank run you'll get your money. Rather, it's setup to ensure that if a bank *fails* - namely, if it took that money its depositors gave the bank and gave it out as loans to businesses that have now failed. In that case, the bank doesn't have your money because it lost it (not because there's not sufficient paper dollars in their vault). 
If there was a bank run, the Federal government would declare a bank holiday and then make rules about the amounts of monies that could be withdrawn over periods of time. And they would print money as needed to ensure paper money was available to meet demand.
