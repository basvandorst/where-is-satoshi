How to buy BTC 10 years ago?
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:52:49
May I suggest using a cryptocurrency focused on privacy, such as Monero? It is entirely fungible. Receive payments in XMR, and if you wanted to cash out, open a Kraken account, trade for USD, and send it to your bank. At that point, if your bank is okay with funds coming from a crypto exchange, you should be good.

That’s wright!

What is the mining scene like in Venezuela? You said electricity is free. It sounds like anyone with any computer knowledge would be mining. 
Do mining operations happen in secret? What does the government think about crypto mining?

Gave you some publicity:

You’re in a great position to educate and onboard people to a system that will help maintain their privacy! The security issues goes both ways.  If you assisted customers by providing simple instructions for how to easily exchange fiat for XMR, and how to make a payment, that would help everyone.

Cheers to you! A new order may be coming your way soon to test the system :)
I honestly feel like with a bit of proper advertising, this could make a splash, and potentially a news story. This screams adoption + real use case! ❤️

How do normal people exchange their piles of Bolivares for crypto? Do you deposit them to your bank and wire funds to an exchange, or are there local Bolivares to crypto services?

Hey! When I was checking out, I noticed your 15% discount. Thanks a lot! Excited to try the maple flavor

I hear DASH has been trying to spread adoption in the area. Are you seeing small and medium size shops accept crypto? - and if so, which crypto currencies are you seeing adopted?

When Grandma asks about your crptobits, it’s time to maybe consider cashing out a little

The next 10 years of bitcoin
We now find ourselves in a period of price stagnation, much like we were between 2014 and 2016. However, there are a few important differences between then and now. In 2018, everyone knows about bitcoin or has at least heard about it. There are many more miners, network fees are high enough, and many new players have entered the trading arena. Hype no longer controls bitcoin’s price, and the increasingly complex industry is getting more stable.
So, what’s next? It’s tough to say for sure, but there are a few indicators that suggest bitcoin will continue to grow. Firstly, programmers and crypto writers have finally begun to concentrate their energy on development rather than promotion. Adoption is still quite low, due to bitcoin’s complexity and the long waiting time for transfers. But when you consider the possibility of exchange-traded futures (ETFs) in the U.S. and Bakkt in 2019, the future looks bright.
This whole article is clickbait.  3/4 of the article was talking about the past 10 years. “What to expect” - “Tough to say” fk off

There is an infinite wealth of resources online for you to learn from and you want to be spoon fed information.

If you’re worried about privacy, XMR is a good option.

Legal gray areas. A Vermont based CBD producer was unable to accept credit card or debit payments. They asked if crypto was a good solution. I explained that Monero was essentially built for this use case. They implemented BTC and XMR payments and have been able to conduct business with private transactions.

So.... BTC skyrocketed and you bought at yearly highs? Rough lesson if you sell now.
