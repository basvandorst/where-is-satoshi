Well if they didn´t they certainly do so now.
Most people had no idea it was written in PHP as they had no ability to look at the code until after it was hacked, it was also easy to transfer out up to 100 btc quickly until the very recent transaction malleability.

Don´t talk about mining or spend much time on how it works. Leave the boring part for questions.
Bitcoin is not simply a decentralized currency, like gold used to be. Its a protocol with lots of features that solves many problems, such as eliminating fraud in trade with built in 2 or 3 party escrow, decreasing identity theft, as the money no longer have to be tied to an identity to keep it safe, instead its tied to a mathematical key generated by one or more owners. 
It will enable for the first time in history autonomous economic agents, such as self-driving cars that can own themselves, and thus be put to much more efficient use and save our enviroment, all sorts of things that is not possible with our old banking system. It have potential to save a lot of money for people and corporations and thus increase the health of the economy, by liberating the money from fees. 
Money that can better be spent on new jobs, increasing the economic wellfare of the population and collected as taxes for the benefit of everyone instead of a selected few owners of private payment companies. It increases competition which is good for everyone.
