A block size increase is necessary to avoid congestion now and buy time, but it's not some panacea, for sure.
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:51:11


Good question. The simple answer lies behind in your first sentence:


People who dislike the idea of Bitcoin as a mere "settlement system" contest this assumption. Is it really a fair one? Bitcoin has done very well so far as a payment system, and that was how it was originally intended to be used.


Perhaps it could be, but we already have a great payment system which scales, with tons of great features like the fact that it uses existing Bitcoin addresses, has familiarity, has been time-tested and works with your existing software... it's called Bitcoin!


Because why should we needlessly complicate things? Sidechains are great and all, but we really don't need to reinvent the wheel (with all the problems that entails) when Bitcoin is a fine currency already.
@_date: 2016-03-01 22:59:10
No, they're a *new* way of thinking. The original Bitcoin whitepaper, written by Satoshi himself, was entitled:


(emphasis mine)
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:17:50
Normally low fees aren't much of an issue, your transaction might get confirmed slightly later but it's not too bad. Right now, however, there's a huge transaction backlog. So if your fee's too low, the transaction won't get confirmed at all. Which sucks.
@_date: 2016-03-02 23:45:51
Of course, yet Core believe we must strangle Bitcoin into a fee market.

I submitted the quote above just because it interested me. I didn't realise it had been linked from &gt; You're also the person who's resubmitted the max blocksize default limit pull request and then submitted to reddit, correct?
I am. What about that? I didn't submit that pull request so it could be brigaded, I linked to it here to draw attention to the default block size. I had created a new pull request because I thought the situation was sufficiently different from 9 months ago to warrant another try.
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:29:57
CheckSequenceVerify looks pretty cool. I hope that gets in.
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:25:08
Some of them, yes. Mostly ones with high fees.
However, [there are ~32k which aren't confirming]( and it's been at that number for quite a while now.
A lot of wallets underestimate fees, which makes this a particular problem.
@_date: 2016-03-06 18:16:45


Where is he lying? He says that “it has become clear to me that some developers don’t want *any* on-chain scaling solution any time soon” – note the “some” (i.e., not all) and “it has become clear to me” (it's a statement of his viewpoint, not of objective fact). This is, therefore, not in contradiction with some developers working on on-chain scalability.


2MB doesn't require huge bandwidth and CPU, at least, not much more than is currently required for full nodes. Would a future block size require much more bandwidth and CPU? Maybe, but this isn't an immediate problem, and do we know that Bitcoin is actually going to start outpacing the capacity of most computers? It hasn't done so far.
It's not like this is a problem exclusive to the block size. Segregated Witness also presents the exact same issue, because it similarly increases the amount of data nodes have to deal with.


You can't always come to a reasonable compromise. Sometimes, you have to forge the path ahead alone.


At present, sure, but we don't know where we'll be in the future. If Bitcoin had existed in 1998 and had a 1MB block size then, it would have been far too large. In 2016, however, most computers can handle it.

That it's a single massive line.
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:12:50

I am somewhat biased, 'tis true. *strangle* isn't the most neutral description.
That said, I don't think that refusing to raise the block cap to force a fee market is wise. It hurts regular users.
@_date: 2016-03-04 12:00:14


We do know what the proposal contains, we do know how it's been implemented so far.
@_date: 2016-03-05 15:38:45


This is a fair point, yes. I was thinking that the bandwidth would be higher if only for processing transactions, but I hadn't considered distributing blocks themselves, which was careless of me.


This is true. I don't run my own node when I'm on a cellular connection, at least not for long periods.
That said, with increasing transaction volume, I don't think we can ever be cellular-friendly. Nodes will have to be on well-connected systems, but that's not so bad, because we have lightweight wallets for those without such systems.


Yeah, that was silly of me. The big thing that worries me is how long IBD takes (since I recently had to deal with it), which seems to be mostly CPU-bound.


It's not a big one, for sure, and the aspects of it that bother me (I can't run a Bitcoin node on my laptop or my VPS without spending on additional storage) can't ever be fixed.
@_date: 2016-03-05 01:58:51

@_date: 2016-03-02 15:40:08

Occam's razor: the media probably isn't launching a coördinated attack on Bitcoin. If their reporting is negative, it merely reflects what they think will interest people and what the sources they listen to say.
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:09:38
Re: hardware requirements of full nodes, I'm unconvinced that 2MB makes much of a difference from 1MB. Consider the hardware resources this puts pressure on:
* Network - 2MB every 10 minutes is a very small amount of bandwidth (~3.33kB/s) and unlikely to tax even slow home DSL connections (like mine) or cellular data.
* CPU time - 2MB means potentially double as many transactions to process. It is not going to take longer than 10 minutes, however.
* Disk space - 2MB means new blocks are at most double their previous size. If all new blocks are 2MB, then disk space runs out twice as fast as before. Of course, blocks will actually just slowly increase in size, so the previously increasing rate of disk consumption simply continues to rise. (This point is applicable to CPU time too - 2MB block sizes don't really raise hardware requirements so much as they don't stop them from increasing like they've been doing so far.)
Nonetheless, it is fair to say that if hardware requirements get much higher, less people will run full nodes. I think increased hardware requirements are an inevitability, though. Even without the block size cap being raised they will continue to increase, because every block mined is another megabyte of disk space taken forever, increasing transaction volume still takes a higher toll on the network even if the amount that can get into blocks is limited (every tx goes to the whole network, remember), and because SegWit also requires more memory, CPU time and disk space.
@_date: 2016-03-01 11:37:10


Yes, but that global cap is approximately 2^(16)⨉2^(128), which is more than could ever be needed.
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:14:48
The block size limit was intended to be temporary, and Satoshi said it could be raised when needed.
@_date: 2016-03-04 15:12:58
Honestly, I get this feeling just from the use of "blockchain" generally. Bitcoin and some other currencies have a proof-of-work chain, aka a blockchain, which forms a public ledger against which to validate transactions. It's clear what the word means in the context of Bitcoin.
But outside the context of cryptocurrencies it feels like a meaningless buzzword. Some government/business is to use "blockchain technology" - what the hell does that mean? Do you mean you're using event sourcing? Do you mean that you're using a Bitcoin fork? Do you mean that you have a file with a linked list in it? For all we know it could simply mean they use Git for version control.
@_date: 2016-03-04 17:41:59
Do you have the one hand-signed by Satoshi? Been looking all over for it, nobody has any copies left.
@_date: 2016-03-03 15:03:34


Not necessarily. You can have a soft fork which causes a chain fork, and you can have a hard fork that doesn't cause a chain fork.
See: 
A soft fork is when new clients don't accept something which was previously valid. A hard fork is when new clients accept something which wasn't previously valid. Both of these can cause chain forks, but they don't in all cases.
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:56:54
If they're making large transactions, maybe.
@_date: 2016-03-01 11:47:51
Yeah, true. IPv4's cap is quite low, really, and that's starting to become a problem.
@_date: 2016-03-02 17:30:13


Zero-conf is fine.
@_date: 2016-03-04 17:21:49


Which two? Does that exclude Satoshi?
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:21:43
Surely we could patch Bitcoin Core so that miners reject such transactions?
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:40:18
Yes, but the question is whose heads are those? It probably sounds like they agree with you no matter what side you're on.
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:32:45
Most likely you're paying higher fees. People who pay lower fees are facing problems.
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:10:49


Indeed it would. 2MB is merely the first step after 1MB and the cap would have to rise again.




Sure, Bitcoin so far has had a 1MB cap. So? It's not like changing that would hurt the currency more than changing anything else would.


Splitting some transactions off the blockchain and onto another chain doesn't really solve the scale issue, it moves it around. It also assumes that the blockchain model can't scale in the first place, which hasn't been true so far.
@_date: 2016-03-04 17:42:42


Satoshi always stated the limit was temporary. Why would he change his mind now?
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:38:34


No, but he did say Bitcoin would be a currency with transactions confirmed reasonably quickly and with low fees. Bitcoin Core, OTOH, believe that Bitcoin should be an expensive settlement layer.
@_date: 2016-03-05 00:58:06


Maybe the initial implementation might take that long, but you need to properly debug it, write unit tests, test it out on a testnet, etc. And bear in mind that the time it takes will depend on the size of the development team and how complex the wallet's integration with the Bitcoin network is.
2MB blocks, on the other hand, require *no action whatsoever* for clients which don't touch the blockchain or merely read it and don't propagate it. AIUI only full nodes need much work (to detect the 75% activation threshold), but it's a lot simpler than SegWit, and the work here is already completely done and released in a stable client: Bitcoin Classic's first version!
@_date: 2016-03-04 17:41:18
If they want full security and to actually increase capacity, yes.
This is one of the problems with SegWit, by the way. It relies on users upgrading to actually realise a capacity increase, and it reduces the security of nodes that don't upgrade.
@_date: 2016-03-04 09:42:42


SegWit doesn't interact well with a 2MB block size, at least in the form proposed so far. It should be done together with a block size increase.
@_date: 2016-03-06 03:17:36
Don't be preposterous. Other cryptocurrencies exist.
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:26:53
Sure, the whitespace doesn't matter for its interpretation, it just makes it look as though you're trying to hide something. That's all.
@_date: 2016-03-05 00:55:52


Absolutely, you could make your own client which incorporates the patches you like best. However, every miner running their own hacked-together version with a different set of patches might not be the best idea.
@_date: 2016-03-02 15:40:48


@_date: 2016-03-05 13:29:28


Alright. You might want to consider making a separate thread, then. I interpreted your question as asking if people disagree with those points, and I don't think I was alone in that interpretation.
@_date: 2016-03-05 13:23:24


That's irrelevant to the question of how difficult it is to update clients.


SegWit incurs its own technical debt, by making transactions lie about how they were verified.

@_date: 2016-03-05 14:15:49
Not a bad idea, transactions would confirm quicker. Bitcoin forks like Litecoin and Dogecoin already do this, and it works for them, so far as I know.

Indeed, the Cold War (at least, that one) ended 24 years ago.
@_date: 2016-03-01 11:40:14
It would be an interesting experiment to run a miner that prioritises *low*-fee transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-04 00:08:46
Not breaking existing clients would be preferable, yes.
However, we have to do a hard fork anyway for 2MB. And if we're going to do that, we might as well do SegWit cleanly at the same time.
It's not like soft-fork SegWit is easier than hard-fork 2MB. Both require a supermajority of miners to support them, and both require clients to be updated (sort-fork SegWit doesn't require *all* clients to update, though).
Side note: One nice thing about a hard fork is it forces client upgrades. A SegWit soft fork reduces pressure on the blockchain, but it can only do so if people upgrade their clients, AIUI.
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:46:59
Accidental splits are unfortunate, sure, but the Bitcoin developers can and must sometimes perform deliberate splits. I don't think Gavin's current position here is really inconsistent with his old one.
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:36:26
Sure, but the question is *why* they are valid transactions and accepted in blocks. If long chain spam is a well-known problem, wouldn't miners use a transaction selection algorithm which rejects such spam?

It's been urgent for years. The later we raise the block size, the more messy it will be as we'll have less time for a grace period.
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:53:03
Of course, but nonetheless, wallets must estimate reasonable fees.
@_date: 2016-03-05 14:49:14
Interesting. I wonder why that number was picked?
@_date: 2016-03-06 01:12:11


Having blocks, period, would increase CPU time, no?


I'm doing that now, and it does work, but it bothers me that my node can't have a full blockchain. If the network fills with nodes which only have the most recent blocks, that'd be worrying.
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:57:40


Yeah, that's the problem. The spam attack, if it is one, has merely made us hit the limit slightly quicker.

@_date: 2016-03-01 17:23:23


It is, but Classic is working towards a block size hard fork *now* and already has some mining support, whereas Core is supposedly going to begin a hard fork in a year's time.
@_date: 2016-03-05 01:42:38


Bitcoin Core has a near-monopoly on full nodes and hashpower, so Bitcoin Core's developers *do* control Bitcoin, if somewhat indirectly.


This sounds bad, but consider that the alert system could be deployed to ensure node operators are aware of the fork, and also that most Bitcoin users these days aren't using full nodes, they're using more lightweight wallets, which are less likely to need upgrading. Also, I think that people running full nodes are more likely to be technically competent and aware of the fork.
(Nonetheless, 28 days is quite a short period of time, alas.)
@_date: 2016-03-05 15:33:45


Altcoins aren't Bitcoin, and while XT, Classic and Unlimited have some non-trivial marketshare, Core still has a near-monopoly. Furthermore, almost all development effort is focussed on Core, and all the other vendors' implementations are based on Core.

Have you rebroadcasted it?
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:39:03


Er, so? 2MB is not supposed to be the final block size limit. It is merely a single raise now to accommodate Bitcoin's current growth. If Bitcoin keeps growing, it will eventually have to accommodate even more transactions somehow.

@_date: 2016-03-03 19:28:24
Segregated Witness has some problems, however. For example, the discounting function means that, at least with the algorithm proposed so far, [you could make pathological 4MB blocks within a "1MB" block size cap](
Furthermore SegWit, in its soft fork implementation, is a somewhat ugly hack that reduces the security of nodes that aren't aware of it.
Personally, I like the suggestion by of a hard fork which does SegWit and 2MB blocks at the same time. This could be cleaner than a SegWit soft fork (no need for hacks so older clients think everything's fine, since we're chain forking anyway), and we wouldn't need the discounting function that is so open to abuse.

@_date: 2016-02-29 20:59:18


Sure, the maximum block size for a newly-created cryptocurrency is rather unimportant unless it's really, really low. Because you're not going to hit it.
That's not the same as the value proposition for a higher maximum block size for Bitcoin, though, which is a currency that is currently struggling with its low block size cap.


Well, it might happen. Bitcoin isn't *completely* saturated yet, but if it gets to the point where it is and it ceases to work well, then you might well see people move to other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:14:06
Bitcoin could end up like that, but it's far from ideal. Why should people be forced to stop using Bitcoin the way they have so far? The limit we have is completely artificial, after all.

@_date: 2016-02-29 18:10:00


Huh? Antpool don't support Classic. If they did, then Classic would control 30% of the network, not 5%.
Anyway, something very similar recently happened with BTCC, where they seemed to be capping blocks at 750kB. People speculated about malicious intent, but it was quickly changed back, and there's an obvious [*Hanlon's razor*]( answer to why you might end up with a 750KB cap: that's the default in Bitcoin Core, unless you change the configuration. So perhaps BTCC's was reset when (if?) they upgraded to 0.12.
If it seems like I've got that wrong, since their cap seems to be 7*3*0kB, not 750kB, that's only due to unit confusion. It's 750kB (where k = 1000⨉), or 732.421875KiB (Ki = 1024⨉), if we're using the modern units. However, a lot of sites use the older convention where kB means 1024⨉, which is a misleading way to measure block sizes given the maximum block size is 1000^2 bytes, not 1024^(2). [There's been a public call for Bitcoin sites to fix their units.](
There was a pull request half a year ago to raise Bitcoin Core's default block cap for mining to 1MB, but it was rejected. [I've reopened it](

Yeah, funny how that works out in retrospect.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:27:42
A fair objection.
@_date: 2016-02-27 19:08:28
You can make some changes without having to fully upgrade the network, sure, but eventually you will have to do something about the block size cap.

Could you explain *why* it's wrong? Supply and demand is a well-understood principle.

A currency that cannot change cannot survive.

I wish I knew. Meanwhile [Bitcoin is racking up &gt;31MB of unconfirmed transactions](

People have! But those other currencies are not Bitcoin and do not have Bitcoin's adoption.

Sorry, The mods have already removed the post.

Indeed, wallets have also been removed from the official site for ideological reasons, for example.
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:43:31


Can you explain why that is? 


I'm not complaining about Bitcoin not moving in my preferred direction. I'm not even talking about Bitcoin's actual future. I was responding to the suggestion that Bitcoin should have smaller blocks.

The maximum block size caps the number of transactions that can be confirmed. If there are, say, 2000 people trying to make a transaction and only, say, 1000 transactions can be confirmed, then 1000 people are going to end up unhappy with their unconfirmed transactions.
Because of this competition for 
transaction confirmation, fees will rise. Higher fees don't help more transactions to be confirmed, they just determine who ends up unhappy (the people who pay lower fees). If people have to pay very high fees and their transactions don't get processed speedily (or, in the worst case scenario, *their transactions don't get processed at all*), then they will get fed up with Bitcoin and switch to a cryptocurrency which isn't arbitrarily limiting the number of transactions it confirms, and thus has reasonable fees and confirmation times.

Bitcoin is a currency operated by a peer-to-peer network. This makes it inherently somewhat democratic: you can run any node software you like. Though if it's not Core, this subreddit's moderators will get mad at you.
And, in fact, miners already vote for some things, e.g. Classic and related BIPs, SegWit, etc. If you mine, you can shape Bitcoin's future, but I must remind you that I am not allowed to advocate for that by this subreddit's moderators.
Users, though? Not currently, and I doubt Core would ever do that. But in a sense nodes do vote by their very existence. 25% of Bitcoin nodes are running versions that support a hard fork to a higher block size, and that number is always rising.

Both of them have special agreements with the EU. They still have to apply EU law, just less of it.

I don't see any troll comments so far, with the possible exception of the most recent one.

That doesn't refute what I was saying. We're not talking about 0-conf transactions here, we're talking about confirmed transactions. And bear in mind that transactions must be confirmed eventually, or the coins can't practically be spent in a future transaction, 0-conf or no.


I never said Lightning, Segwit and a 2MB block size would lead to less room for transactions. Those would 
mean *more* transactions could fit in a block, and *bigger* block sizes (2MB vs. 1MB).
Let's revisit my original statement, which you were responding to:


(emphasis mine)
I am contending that a *smaller* block size would mean less transactions. This is assuming that the transaction load on the Bitcoin network is the same or worse than at present. Obviously, if transactions no longer take up as much space, and there are less of them, then a smaller block size is not an issue. But that's not the situation I'm talking about.


Well, there's plenty to choose from. If they want something like Bitcoin, Litecoin is one option. There's also non-Bitcoin-based currencies.
It's not FUD to claim that, *if Bitcoin becomes unusable as a currency* people will stop using Bitcoin. That's the same as what happens to unusable currencies in the real world.


Few currencies are close to Bitcoin, it's true, but Bitcoin is still, for now, working properly. If Bitcoin becomes strangled by the block size, then people have no choice but to move to other currencies... and then the adoption problem solves itself.
@_date: 2016-02-29 21:02:29
Bear in mind that was about 9 months ago. The average block size is a lot higher now.
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:47:50
You quoted me, sure. Could you point out where I contradict myself?
