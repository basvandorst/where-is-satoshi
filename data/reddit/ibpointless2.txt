Satoshi problems.

I try to send $50 to another wallet and the economy fee was $20. The fees are too high, don't know why anyone would contest this?

Try being new to all this and your hardware wallet ask you if you want to use SW or Legacy and not know what that means or even caring. I think everyone is forgetting that simple is better for mass adoption.

What about when he wants to cash out his wallet? How does he avoid the fees then?

So the Lighting Network is a Gift Card Network? To buy coffee using the lightning network you have to buy a $100 gift card to that coffee shop which means you can only spend that money at the coffee shop. If your friend wants to buy from the coffee shop she has to give you money so she can use your gift card? Whatever money left over on the card gets returned to you?
This doesn't sound like an elegant solution.

This is important. When people try to use Bitcoin and see that it cost $20 to move Bitcoin and take 2 days to do so when Bitcoin Cash does it for $0.02 and within minutes we will see a big change.

The problem I have with the ledger is that it's not the most newbie friendly. I don't like how you have to download 2 apps to get it to work. You need the Bitcoin and Altcoins app then the manager if you want to add more coins to it. 
Then for Bitcoin you have legacy and segwit options that just seem to confuse people. Then for some reason, Bitcoin Cash is lumped in with Bitcoin and if you select the app on the Nano it still opens to the Bitcoin wallet. You must go to settings and change the blockchain to the correct one which a new person might not get or understand.

That's high for sending anything under $1,250.

What I find most interesting is when you hear people talk about how they had like 50 Bitcoin and they sold it when it was X value and you think to yourself that they could have been rich if they held out, but they did not know the future and probably had bills to pay. 
The only people who become rich off of Bitcoin either already had plenty of money to live on and did not need to cash out, had so many Bitcoin (very early adopters) and could not spin it fast enough, or kids who just so happen to have Bitcoins and there parents took care of the daily expenses, or even the guy who forgot he had some. 
As for the average joe working to survive he already spent his coin so that he could eat.

When Satoshi Nakamoto abandon Bitcoin.

Not completely true, Lighting Network over complicates things and does not offer the best solution. To create these channels you have to pay a Bitcoin transaction fee for the multisig, then put up a bunch of Bitcoin for the channel, and when you close the channel you have to pay another transaction fee. Too many hoops to jump through.

You did realize that the Nano S was a USB type A and your MacBook was a type C right? The adaptors are cheap, even BestBuy carries them now.

If you have less then $500 in Bitcoin then store them in a phone wallet like Bread Wallet for iOS and Andriod. Bread wallet will tell you the seed words, you must write these down on pen and paper. Write it down twice, one goes to a safe location in your home and the other goes to a trusted place like your mom or safety deposit box. 
The reason you store it in two locations is in case your house burns down or other disasters strike. Never want to directly type out the phrase on your computer because you could have spyware looking for this and they will take it. 
The Seed is your Bitcoin. Think of it as a seed that grows into a tree and the branches that form from the tree are the addresses. You can have many branches and it all came from that one single seed. If your tree dies, stolen, or cut down you still remember the order to make that seed and generate a new tree. This is why it's important to store the seed words safely. 
If you have more then $500 you need a hardware wallet which uses the same idea of seeds or make a paper wallet. Here is a video showing how to make a paper wallet... 
When it comes to paper wallets you need to treat them like seeds. Don't share them with anyone and keep one copy in a safe in your home and a third party place like a safety deposit box. Only generate paper wallets with the internet off and restart the computer and printer when done and before reconnecting to the internet.

What sucks the most is if Bitcoin implodes its bound to take others with it and taint the cryptocurrency world for some time.

Future advances should help to make it faster and cheaper or it will continue to be your savings account where you make big purchases from. The other coins like litecoin will be  the checking accounts for everyday spending.

Does this not worry anyone else? Wasn't Bitcoin created to get away from banks?

Lightning Network won't really be a good way to send $30 once to your buddy. Lightning Network is better for multiple transactions between you and your buddy. 
If you send Bitcoin through the Lightning Network to your buddy once you both will have to crate a channel to each other. Since you want to give him $30 you will need to deposit the $30 into the channel. To create the channel you will need to create a multisig on Bitcoin's blockchain, so you will need to pay whatever fee it is at that time. You then send the coin to your buddy through the lightning network. For your buddy to get the Bitcoin you, him, or both need to close the channel and when you do that this gets written to the blockchain and once again you pay the fee's of Bitcoin transaction to do this. As you can see you pay the transaction fees twice making this solution not so good for small one time payments. 
If Lighting Network takes off you'll see payment nodes that can join you and your friend together and make the transfer cheaper that way. But for these nodes to happen, you'll need someone with a lot of capital.

This analogy is to show to people how the public ledger idea works and how it's hard to steal someone's money.

One way I explain the Blockchain to people is that I get them to pretend they have a piece of paper. The more people you have the better it proves your point. I tell them to put down the number 15 on the paper.
When everyone has the number on the paper I ask them that they agree that the majority of users agree that the number on the paper is 15? They say yes and I move on. 
I then change my number 15 to number 100. I then ask everyone what their number on their pages say and they say 15. Since everyone can see that their paper says 15 and its the majority then I must be wrong. 
I then tell them to imagine 1,000's of computers doing this same thing and that is how the blockchain works.

I don't understand this. If bcash had the same traffic as Bitcoin does then wouldn't it handle the load better because of the 8x bigger block size?

High fees and long tx times is Bitcoin's bubble and it won't end well.
