Bitfinex users are investors. They are using the exchange to invest into other currencies. You're arguing semantics. Pointless.
And I'm not referring to illiquidity when I'm talking about the bailouts, the bailouts were indeed shoring up insolvency that was occurring due to so many mortgages defaulting
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:02:57
FDIC doesn't really have anything to do with this. FDIC is for when a bank itself becomes insolvent due to defaults in its books, it's really not for when a client(Bitfinex) using the bank becomes insolvent and starts playing games with accounts at the bank they have access to. 
*If* Synapse didn't do anything and Bitfinex took money out the FDIC would be telling users to take it up with Bitfinex, Synapse and the courts, they wouldn't be pitching in.

No, in reality only US banks that pass strict regulatory standards and pay the FDIC are FDIC insured. Bitfinex is neither a US bank nor is it FDIC insured.

They aren't exactly hiding insolvency. When an institution tells you everyone can only withdraw 64% of funds you're pretty much screaming you have an insolvency lol
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:01:03
That insurance only applies to SynapsePay banking partner losses, not Bitfinex losses. 
In other words let's pretend that through SynapsePay your funds at Bitfinex were deposited and held by "Bank A." 
If Bank A becomes insolvent then your funds are fine because Back A is FDIC insured. But if the insolvency is with Bitfinex instead the FDIC is not going to provide any money since Bitfinex is not FDIC insured. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:37:19
The problem with this policy is that investors tend to freak out if they fear their investments aren't safe, they proceed to run on the institution and when everyone pulls their money out at once obviously there's a default and it's straight to bankruptcy. In other words it's great if everyone is on board, but that never happens
That was kind of the point of the bailouts a few years ago... the government guaranteed payouts in the short term for the banks with oversight on operations, hope being they could stay in business and make up losses over time. The result was investors were largely calmed into riding out the storm until institutions gained their footing again.
The ideal scenario for bitfinex would be to have a large institution loan them enough to cover that 36% akin to what the US did with its banks. Unfortunately that's a tall order for what most view institutions as a highly risky business built on a niche ecosystem.

No, it really isn't. You can sign up for a venmo account far quicker and enormously easier than you can research, acquire, and transfer bitcoins to something that everyone accepts. It takes roughly 20 seconds to connect a checking account to venmo and then you can pay anyone in the US with a bank account for free. 
And if you see someone draw money out of your bank account unauthorized via venmo you can simply alert your bank and they'll reinstate it. I'm not sure why trust is some paramount issue.

They have actually, they have a slew of laws that predate bitcoin that very clearly cover it. There is no legal conundrum here, the laws were written broadly to cover cases that were unpredictable at the time they were written. 


No, christ no. In case you actually want to be informed of how the world works here is what's going on with the IRS. 
The IRS has to work with the IRC(law written by Congress). Everything they issue is based off the IRC. The way the IRC is written is that everything is treated by default like property unless otherwise specified. If you read the IRC there is no special treatment for anything like bitcoin, so therefore, by default, it's treated like property. 
And lo and behold if you actually read IRC guidance they literally say...


They don't declare it property, they simply say treat it as property, and that's only for federal taxes, and holds zero bearing anywhere else.

Most potential fraud results in zero money changing hands, most of it results in the company putting a flag on your account and watching it closely for awhile and any strange purchases getting a hold put on them.

They weren't actually specifically designed to withstand plane impacts. These weren't defensive oriented towers, there was little expectation of a large passenger jet hitting them so there wasn't much effort expended in securing against that case. They simply ran a quick, simple, simulation of an impact of a smaller plane and it passed and they paid it no more heed, keep in mind this was a simulation done in 1964 with extraordinarily rudimentary calculations. Collision theory and simulation at that time was in infancy and attempting to simulate a such a complex event was a crapshoot at that time.

That's actually not technically true. When you deposit money in a bank account it is not a bailment, it's a legal transfer of ownership. That money is fully the bank's at that point. Technically what's yours is a deposit account which stands for a liability against the bank.
This concept of ownership transfer is why banks are able to operate as fractional reserves. 
That being right you're correct to a degree in the sense that they can't just take your money. I say "to a degree" because they're still able to take out fees and whatnot without your say provided those fees are spelled out to you ahead of time for use of the account.

Potatoes bred to grow faster, a systems engineer tightening up logistics by devising a better factory route, compression algorithms further developing, these are the kinds of things I'm talking about. Every day thousands of little developments happen that make producing things faster, cheaper, and easier. 


We're not really at that point or going to be at that point in our lifetimes, and in all likelihood we probably won't ever be at that point as a species. By the time there's actually a critical shortage of something like platinum on earth we will likely have developed ways of pulling it off extraterrestrial sources for example. 
You're literally talking about betting against humanity's ability to adapt and progress, and it's a bet that has never paid off.

Do you not have car insurance? Is your viewpoint "Well, if I cause an accident it was my mistake and so I should have to pay full for it, can't do anything else about that." 
Because honestly I think just anteing up and getting car insurance is a much better idea than driving around with nothing to hedge against what may be a costly mistake. In the same way I think it's rather stupid to have no insurance for your wealth in the case that you make a costly mistake that loses it. 
If you are all about personal responsibility then isn't the most responsible thing to do is to admit you're human and prone to making mistakes from time to time and should use something that minimizes the cost of those mistakes to nothing.

Arthur Anders**e**n messed up once and overnight a firm pulling in $9.3 Billion a year was annihilated. It sent a pretty big fucking message that fabricating audits is not worth it and ever since nothing like it has happened. So.... Your point is that one audit in millions by the major firms failed terribly and it hasn't happened since? Does the fact that you have to go back to 2001 to find an example clue you in to anything? 
Additionally you haven't actually defended proof of reserve. Are you actually naive enough to believe that shows anything? It would be fairly easy for a company in default to satisfy a proof of reserve simply by shifting some assets around and not mentioning their liabilities, there's no reason to be assured by one. Audits check proof of reserves along with liabilities and operational stability, there's no reason to not want the totality of a businesses finances checked when looking for solvency because that's literally the only way to prove solvency.

Salt doesn't cause rust. Water does. Avoiding water is how you go about avoiding rust.

It has no trade secrets or patents for unique products or services to offer to set it apart. It has a toxic brand that is going to do the complete opposite of attract people. You would have a better chance at making a successful exchange by starting completely from scratch than from trying to do it with the radioactive carcass that is MtGox. 
Should a rehab plan be put in place the likely outcome isn't going to be MtGox pulling itself from the ashes, it's going to be MtGox burning up even more of its assets and defaulting again leaving even less to go around for creditors than would have been the case had they simply liquidated in the first place. The best plan *is* admitting that MtGox is a lost cause and paying back what's left before more damage can be done.

You are aware that your sources do absolutely nothing to compare the cost of modern war vs war from prior eras right? 
Let's look at World War II. The Nazis killed 550,000 French when there were 41 million living in the region at the time. Does that seem like a lot?  Nearly 2000 years before fiat a guy named Ceasar killed 1 million and enslaved another 1 million in that region and that was when there were only ~5 million alive there at the time. Does that seem like a cheap war to you?
World War II resulted in the death of about 3% of the world's population.  Seems like a lot right? The Mongols killed 11% in their time, the Lushan Rebellion took out 16% in its time. In the grand scheme of things not even WWII measures up to the destruction wrought in prior eras. 
Back then war didn't cost 6-7% of your paycheck, it cost a hell of a lot of people their lives as massive armies marched through and ate everything leading to starvation. Economies used to spend far more on war than we remotely approach today.
In fact if you actually bother to look at studies regarding the frequency and cost of war over the last thousands of years you'll find they all conclude that today is the era where wars not only cost the least, but are also the most infrequent. A person today on earth is more unlikely to die from war related causes than at any other time in human history. The rise of fiat has actually coincided with a more peaceful globe.

It really shouldn't be. This isn't a proper audit at all and could have been easily gamed. For instance, prior to the audit bitstamp may have been short on bitcoins and it could have simply used up fiat reserves to buy up coins to put it over, thus transferring the short over to its fiat holdings which Mike Hearn didn't have any way of verifying. It would have been really easy for them to mask insolvency because Mike Hearn wasn't actually seeing their full financials.

I'm talking about low prices for the same goods. Wal Mart is able to do huge amounts of business because it can sell the same products cheaper than most other companies. My town had a smaller local general goods store that treated its workers great, paid good wages, and did a lot of good for the community. Did that help them when Wal Mart came to town? Nope. Despite years of the media highlighting how shitty Wal Mart was treating its employees, and despite how the town was up in arms about everything Wal Mart did, the town still went shopping at Wal Mart because they offered better prices on the same items and the "better" store went bankrupt. People will wax poetic about how terrible a company is, but if that company can give them a better deal they're going to use it.

I would say it would have very little chance of success even in that condition. 
Tell me, why would this perfect investor/management team that can create such a perfect exchange not just start a completely new exchange instead of taking on one whose brand is destroyed and that gives them net liabilities of about $400 million right off the bat? 
This perfect investor/management group could literally buy up the equivalent of all the tangible assets that MtGox has, servers, offices, etc etc for less a tenth of that debt, meaning the debt they have to clear to become profitable is an order of magnitude smaller *and* they don't have that awful association with MtGox burdening them. 
Investors actually looking to make a profitable exchange would realize this, they would realize it would be easier to achieve a successful exchange starting from scratch instead of starting with that massive liability hanging overhead in both brand and creditors. 
Which makes you wonder about people like Sunlot or other investor groups who aren't just making their own exchange and are instead opting to offer to  rehab a company that's so far in the hole. It seems to me either Sunlot is full of idiots who don't realize it would be easier to start from scratch, or it's full of scammers who have no intention of making a profitable exchange and instead want to bleed out MtGox assets for themselves until it fully dies.

In reality people weren't able to invest in the "internet" back then. They had to invest in specific companies. It was very difficult to see which companies actually had staying power. Everyone talks about Amazon and Apple today, well, in the mid 1990's Apple was being annihilated by Microsoft and the like and Amazon was a book store that was losing money every single year. Neither was really setting itself apart from the rest of the sector, a sector that would mostly crash and burn by 2001 and be replaced with different companies. 
Much of the things that looked like "safe bets" ended up dying and the things that were actually destined to succeed weren't really showing it. I don't get how you can consider it a mark against someone that they were able to identify that a sector was a veritable crapshoot and avoided it instead of them diving in and hoping to land on one of the very few companies that would actually succeed long term.

You can go find large interviews with Sid Meier in things like Time Magazine, pieces by New Yorker and Rolling Stone about Persson. Hundreds upon hundreds of articles have been penned about them and their work in mainstream media. Go look at the sheer volume of content on their wikipedia pages compared to Andreas. Your two examples are people who have a large plethora of sources about them from a wide range of media and publication types.

You didn't cite the entire law. Notably you didn't cite this part...
"to avoid a transaction reporting requirement under State or Federal law"
This part you are most certainly guilty of if you are unlicensed. I can guarantee you have not fulfilled any reporting requirements as a money transmitter. Which would make you guilty of money laundering.

A lot of credit union's have the same policy. Historically speaking a large number of random people depositing cash into a person's consumer level account has tended to be a sign that said person is doing something illegal, as there aren't many legal activities that involve large amounts of random people depositing cash into a consumer level account. 
As for why someone would choose a for profit over non profit, many of those for profit banks have better financing services than credit unions can afford to offer. Just FYI.

Mpesa is nothing like bitcoin. It was designed from the ground up to work with the infrastructure that is currently in place. It was designed by African companies specifically for African infrastructure. 
In contrast bitcoin was not at all designed with Africa in mind. For one, its mining system pretty much instantly insured that most of Africa would be left behind as it didn't have the computing power to compete with most the world. The "easy" money for bitcoins were guaranteed to fall into the hands of people in developed nations who have access to the most computing power who could mine the quickest. 
Secondly, 5 years in bitcoin isn't really easily usable on anything less than a smartphone. Which does most of the billion people in Africa little good. 
So not really a rational comparison. On one hand you have something designed for the ground up for the reality of the infrastructure in places like Kenya. On the other hand it's pretty clear you have something that was designed with little concern to its use in undeveloped or developing nations, or possibly the creator was concerned but wasn't well informed on the realities of the infrastructure in place for these countries and how they would be left behind from the start.

They also can't really stop cash transactions at all, doesn't mean cash isn't effectively regulated. 
In practicality what matters is who people choose to do business with.

It wasn't really, there was no licensing related to being an exchange and their operation wasn't actually inspected and verified. Japan at the time it began had no laws regarding virtual currency exchanges so they could do whatever they wanted. 


Do you have any proof of this or are you just speculating? I would argue there being a lack of a regulated exchange anywhere mostly deterred people from using bitcoin altogether and saved a good deal of people from losing anything. 


The bitcoin that the US seized was being used for illicit activities, so they seized it from criminals and ended up distributing it to a widely respected investor who intends to use it to increase bitcoin use in developing nations. That doesn't really seem like it's a bad thing for the average consumer, if anything it's helpful to bitcoiners.

These are some of the reasons Wikipedia uses to justify being selective in regards to what's allowed. I think Andreas' article is actually a good example of how an article ends up short, poorly written and poorly sourced when the topic is not very notable, and he even agrees. 
* We require "significant coverage" in reliable sources so that we can actually write a whole article, rather than half a paragraph or a definition of that topic.

LOL are you confused about what allocated gold is and how it is treated legally? 
With allocated gold you have specific bars of gold attributed to you and a bullion vault can literally never touch them for any reason but to give them back to you. They may never be used as collateral or lent by the vault for any reason and in the case of a bankruptcy are exempt from being included in valuations and will be returned to you. 
The *only* way to lose your specific bars is via theft, which has never happened for the major bullion deposits that are used in gold trading, or a war. Now, every sane person consider a war reaching the UK's bullion deposits to have a small enough chance of happening to be in all practicality zero. In other words the risk of losing allocated gold overall is in all practicality zero.

1. It's tough for companies to pull off unbiased claims departments. When an employee is drawing his wages from a company he is going to be biased towards that company. Unless a company explicitly charges its employees with "give customers the benefit of the doubt" it's going to run into issues of denying warranted claims(which leads to suits), and if it does train employees to yield commonly to the customer they're going to likely end up paying even more in refunds than they would with a third party.
2. People are more inclined to accept the decision of a third party than the decision of who they are disputing. If someone disputes Company A and Company A responds with "We decided we did nothing wrong, no refund" they're going to have a lower chance of dropping the dispute than if their claim was denied by a third party. Many people won't back away from a claim until a third party denies them, and it's a lot more cheaper for that third party to be a payment processor than a court.

I understand what his goal was. Frankly, I don't care about what something was meant to do, I care about what it can do. And that's how much of the world thinks too. Satoshi I believe made one fatal error in judging what makes cash in non-online commerce so desirable. It isn't that cash can be used in direct transactions to avoid third party oversight, it's that it can be used that way *and* it can be easily used with financial servicing as well. 
That's why I don't think bitcoin has chance to really stick around. It's trying to replicate cash for online commerce but is still missing a huge part of what makes cash so great in the physical world. If an altcoin comes around that is able to achieve both easy access to financial servicing *and* can be used in direct transactions with no need of a third party then you'll see a real paradigm shift. That would be truly revolutionary to online commerce. 


No, what makes it very similar to cash is its ability to be used in transactions without a third party. That's the very key of bitcoin and I think you keep missing it. 
When you buy something with cash the only people involved are you and the seller. In contrast when you buy something with a credit card your bank is a part of the transaction as well. Satoshi is trying to acheive the former, making an online exchange unit for direct transactions, but I think he fell short because he didn't consider that financial servicing is part of what makes cash so great as well.

Then bitcoin won't have much of a future as a currency. There's a reason banking economies have outpaced everything else for 600 years, it's because they work better. Your statement above pretty much precludes the possibilty of banking, and not being able to utilize banking with a currency is going to ultimately render it worth very little to the vast majority of everyone. 
Taking banking services out of the picture isn't a leap forward, it's a step back. 
Edit: For everyone asserting that a currency can't achieve being able to be directly transacted with no 3rd party involvement *and* can still be readily used for banking they need to read about cash. It is able to achieve those two things and we've known about it for awhile. It's actually cited in the title of "white paper" as an example of what bitcoin is trying to achieve.

The very first federal law enforcement agency established in the US was the USPS's and it still exists to this day(in fact it can be argued it actually predates the United States by a few years).
One of the major charges of the United States Postal Inspection Service is to investigate packages to for illicit material(narcotics, child pornography, bombs, hazardous materials etc etc) and in fact they already employ various methods, such as sniffing dogs, to detect potentially illicit materials. 
For non-first class mail they are actually even allowed to open any and all letters and packages, and do so at random. For First Class Mail they must obtain a warrant to open a package, generally these warrants are obtained when a package sets off alarms from noninvasive detection methods, such as a dog or radioactivity detector.

A claim is made though that people should use the report to give them more confidence in bitstamp, which they shouldn't. 
To be honest, I'm not sure why this report was released at all and I'm not sure why you agreed to do it to lend your name to it. It really says nothing about the solvency of bitstamp and no one should be told to put more confidence in bitstamp because of it. It's completely misleading and entirely improper to release because of that.

So by the logic in your original post, when you allowed someone to steal your checks *you* should have been the one at fault and *you* should have been the one responsible for the loss right? So why are you saying the bank was correct to return the funds to you? 
In other words, from your perspective, the person who allowed their checks to be compromised(you), then the bank, should have responsibility in that order for the stolen money. 
Edit: It seems like you're not actually being consistent here at all, and in reality just always want the money to come to you regardless of which side of the equation you're on.

The former practice involves high rates of fraud and in many states is actually illegal to do sans a license. 
Simply put, when random people start making frequent deposits to a consumer level account a lot of red flags go off, that's very atypical behavior and the majority of the time it's indicative of a person engaging in behavior that puts the bank at risk of fraud and/or indicative of activities falling outside the law.

That money isn't actually lost from the economy, it isn't just up and vanishing. It's ultimately being paid to people to maintain that infrastructure and those people are a part of the economy. On a macro scale $48 billion isn't being lost, it's just changing hands. 
There are really only 2 ways money is lost from an economy.
1. Destruction: Pretty self explanatory. If you have a $100 bill and burn it then that's $100 gone from the economy
2. Holding: Unused money. If you throw $100 under a matress and just sit on it it's not doing anything for the economy and is effectively gone. Banks remedy this by taking money people would otherwise hold and using it to finance loans and investments and whatnot and put it back into the economy. When people are their own banks this tends to not happen, and in many cases a person being their own bank ends up costing the economy more actual losses than what using a bank would result in.

That's not really true. You can buy what's called allocated bullion. In the case of allocated bullion the vault by law is never allowed to use your gold for anything and it is fully and legally yours and is insured in the case of vault theft. Should the vault go bankrupt you would not need to wait for proceedings to go through nor will you get a partial payment back, you would be able to immediately withdraw your investment in full. Should the vault be subject to theft you would still be able to get your full value out immediately through insurance. 
Unallocated bullion carries some similar types of risk to bitcoin exchanges(albeit orders of magnitudes lower because of strict regulations and insurance), but allocated bullion is actually far less risky than keeping gold yourself.

In reality the IRS is generally able to establish the existence of additional unreported income by valuating a person's assets and inspecting their expenditures. You can certainly get away with hiding small amounts of money in bitcoin, just like you could get away with hiding a few hundred dollars under your mattress, but if those bitcoins make up a significant amount of what you're spending then they're going to be able to look around at all your shit, realize you can't afford it, then ask for you to prove how you paid for every single thing. 
When you can't prove that you paid for it with reported income they're going to levy a mountain of fines on you that are far higher than any taxes you would have paid and toss you into federal prison. 
The IRS isn't new to dealing with untrackable payment systems. They've been dealing with cash, which is more anonymous and less trackable than bitcoins, since the 1860s.

It's easy to exploit on a one off basis, but banks very quickly notice when a vendor or buyer is exhibiting systemic issues with transactions. 
For instance, if you start using chargebacks to regularly scam money away from retailers you'll find your credit card account will quickly be ended and you'll be blacklisted and will not easily get another account with any bank. 
Or if you're a vendor who exhibits an abnormally high rate of not sending items or mistakenly charging people's cards you'll face no longer being able to accept credit cards.

Well, first of all not even in a financial sense is it cheaper. I pay no fees to maintain a bank account. Even if I did those security measures cost time and effort and require being very proactive, none of which is in reality cheaper. With my bank account I don't have to spend time securing anything or be overly conscious of the security of every device I use and be cautious of who I send money to. That's valuable. I don't spend time for instance heavily vetting every single Chrome extension I have because i know if one steals my info and charges my card it only takes a phone call to reverse the charges and reset my password. In regards to cost I would say a bank account is resoundingly cheaper. 


Banks make their profits off of fractional reserve banking(creating loans, making investments etc etc), not from CC services. CC services are a loss leader for banks to drive customers to them. You're right, they don't really make money from CC services, they subsidize those services quite a bit which makes them a poor deal for banks and a good deal for consumers.

You're forgetting that bitcoin isn't going to make your company magically become perfectly run and chargeback situations will continue to exist where you will need to reimburse customers for errors and whatnot or else be taken to court(which is enormously more expensive than chargebacks cost). 
For most companies it's cheaper to allow a payment processor provide arbitration for customer disputes than it would be for a company to do it themselves or use a court system.

That's not really true at all, cash is very similar to bitcoin in practice as a financial instrument. It can be used and is frequently used in transactions with zero third party involvement. Bitcoin is essentially trying to create "online cash" to take the place of the dominant form of payment online, which is credit and debit card(which require third party involvement, generally a bank). 
And cash is not really a new financial concept. It might be new in the sense of the internet, but in terms of finances the concept dates back to antiquity.

Generally people put money in low interest bank accounts specifically because they don't want to invest that money themselves, so for someone that wouldn't be doing anything else with that money it's not really an issue or a cost to them that they get low interest on it. The alternative for them would be getting zero interest on it and having to do security themselves. 
Not to mention banks also include investments into other offerings as part of determining what levels of service you get. So someone could have most of their money into higher return bank offerings like investment portfolios and whatnot and would qualify for the special treatment reserved for millionaire clients.

Generally speaking these transactions are stopped *because* of regulations, in that a person exhibited behavior that correlates highly with people breaking the law and so the bank is legally compelled to halt the behavior and report them.

For instance I can fully transfer possession of a $20 bill to someone else simply by handing it to them. You can't really do that with bitcoin, at best you can tell someone the key to a group of coins, but then really you both possess it, it isn't until it's moved via the network to a wallet only they control that it's truly under their possession. 
Or, put another way, the USD existed nearly 200 years before the internet existed, and significant portions still exist and are used sans the internet.

An audit, hope for an actual financial audit. "Proof of reserves" is meaningless and isn't really an accepted financial practice for proving anything to the public, even including fiat it's meaningless, it wouldn't be impossible or even hugely challenging to prove reserves while being insolvent, I'm not sure where this community got the idea that this is something that professional institutions bother with or something they should put weight into. 
A reasonable assurance of solvency only comes from an examination of all parts of a company's financial statements, not just one specific asset class. If an examination isn't looking at liabilities then it isn't seeing anything worthwhile.

The law is about intent. If a website establishes it has no intent to facilitate illegal activity then it's not going to be charged with facilitating illegal activity. I'm not sure why this is a difficult concept. 


I would certainly have no problem with this. 


Because the construction company does not own the sidewalk, it's simply hired to build it. The owners are responsible for the sidewalk and what happens on it. 
And yes, we do hold property owners liable for what happens on their property. If a corporate plaza for instance is overrun with gangs and the owner isn't reporting them they can be charged with a crime. This is why it's common for real estate owners to hire security firms to walk through their properties to look for and discourage trouble. 


Your recollection is incorrect. The IRS never actually made new laws regarding bitcoin(the IRS can't actually make laws at all, they aren't a legislative body, that's a Congressional power), the laws have been in place for years and years before bitcoin was even a thought. The only thing the IRS released was a guidance which was basically a friendly reminder that laws exist.

Except the reasons for these falls are pretty transparent. 
4-5 years ago prices in both made large investments into production sensible. Those investments came to fruition in recent months and have flooded the market with excess supply. Additionally it's winter(low amounts of driving, low amounts of construction) which has lessened demand, and cars are becoming more efficient, which has lessened oil demand. 
It's really easy to point to the specific demand/supply factors that are driving those commodity prices down, for bitcoin there's really nothing obvious to point to.

No. Because they establish that it's not allowed to be posted and they actively police and remove it and report users to authorities. "Facilitating" means aiding, if a website is actively reporting users to police and removing them they are very clearly not aiding them.

So... What is it actually solving then? Tallying things like reserves has always been the easiest part of examining a business. We've had fantastic solutions for that for decades now. It's always been the other types of assets and liabilities that make it complicated, and this isn't addressing that. Counting "legacy currency" in a modern audit really isn't more complicated than a few key strokes on a computer.


Okay... But all those non-client liabilities that are the cost of running the business are. Salaries, leases, administrative costs, premiums etc etc. If they go through tough times and start taking out a bunch of loans to pay for business expenses so they can preserve their clients' reserves they are certainly still going to be liable to defaulting which will tangle up client deposits in a bankruptcy case.

Neither of these things has happened, and because of that we have no way of knowing that they actually were able to fully cover the loss from their own pocket.

Kind of. M Pesa itself began as a money transfer system. That was what it was developed to be and released as. The idea for it however came from researchers noticing people using airtime minutes to transfer wealth. 


Again, M Pesa was intended from day 1 to be a money transfer service. And its adoption had virtually nothing to do with monetary policy(as it's still tied to the national currency) and everything to do with people in Kenya(and other M Pesa countries) not having banks and therefore not having payment cards.
M Pesa is really similar a concept to Visa or Mastercard with a few key differences. Those differences being that instead of using a bank as an intermediary to deal with the network you just deal directly with M Pesa, and instead of payment cards and payment terminals it relies on phones.

Supply and demand. 
1. 4-5 years ago high oil prices made it financially sensible to invest shit tons of money into new drilling and fracking infrastructure in the US. That infrastructure has been finished being built and brought up to speed finally in recent months and has led to an explosion in supply
2. East Asia has been consuming less than projected due to a slightly stalled economy. (Less demand)
3. Americans drive less in winter. (Less demand)
4. Cars are increasing in efficiency. (Less demand)
It's not really a secret or a conspiracy on why the price is falling, the US's oil investments from years ago are finally operational and people are driving less in more efficient cars. 
Likewise I'm not sure why you're looking for a complicated answer for bitcoin's price. People that bought in high simply becoming frustrated with losing wealth and bowing out makes a lot more sense than a vast banking conspiracy.

Well, in the real world, you're wrong. In the real world there are constraints as to what you can realistically do to address a problem. 
In regards to security those contraints are generally cost and ease of access. You can certainly build up layer after layer of security, and use the system to take away places that a person can fail at, but all the while you're taking away ease of use which rapidly drives people away. 
Banks for instance could reduce a lot of identity theft by requiring far more pieces of information about a person whenever someone calls to make changes to an account or spends their money. But they choose not to. Why? Because no one wants to pull out multiple forms of identification every time they make a purchase. Because people forget and lose things and it's better to let 20 people who forget their security question answer or lose something like their password to be let through to access to their account in spite of their stupidity than it is to have more stringent requirements which deny people at any single failure. That might lock out an extra thief or two, but will also lock out those 20 customers and create a hassle for them. 
Security has to be balanced with ease of use, it has to consider all the people prone to mistakes and still has to work for them. It's better to suck up the cost of a few compromises while still letting the system work for those who mess up than it is to make an impenetrable security system that is a hassle for a user to work with when a user fails at something.

Which is an important feature of currency. Slow steady inflation that the dollar has exhibited since its change to fiat has loads of evidence showing it to be desirable. The gold standard had the same feature for thousands of years as mining production outpaced human economies which made gold inflationary in value. It wasn't until human population started skyrocketing in the 1800s and 1900s that mining stopped being able to produce gold fast enough to keep up with the economy and not coincidentally that happens to be the time when the standard stopped working.

Gold isn't really used as a currency today in everyday life. When it was used it was inflationary for the vast majority of its history due to mining.

As far as this goes, closed ecosystems such as gift cards/coupons are not under money transmission regulations. 
This is why games like World of Warcraft explicitly state in their Terms of Service that players are not to sell in game currency/items for real world money. If they officially allowed such a thing they would need to file as a money transmission business.

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, you HAVE to be a troll because no one could possibly be this lost regarding basic accounting. HOLY MOLEY, I really, really hope you're a troll. 
Allow me to give you an example of how a company can be insolvent while still showing full reserves.
Let's call a company MtIdiot. MtIdiot has clients with $100 million in deposits so has $100 million in reserves. But MtIdiot is run by idiots who decided a new $100 million office would be the perfect building for them. So they decide to use a loan to get the office. The loan company pays for the office and now MtIdiot owes them $100 million. 
So at this very moment MtIdiot has $100 million in reserves but has $200 million of liabilities! But guess what, none of the clients know about the extra $100 million in liabilities because MtIdiot doesn't publish financial statements(because there are no silly government regulations compelling them to). 
So time goes by and MtIdiot starts to bring in less money than they expend, and they keep having to take out loans to cover paying employees, equipment, utilities etc etc. Eventually they get up to $150 million in loans(so they have $100 million in reserves with $250 million in liabilities). They continuing taking out loans to pay their costs but then one day they reach their limit and loans get cut off.
So what happens when they get cut off? Well now the day of reckoning has come as those $100 million in reserves are now on the hook for $250 million in liabilities and they are officially insolvent!!!
**TL:DR: The blockchain is only a partial ledger of a company's assets. To actually determine solvency you need to know liabilities which the blockchain doesn't deal with.** This is basic accounting 101. 
@_date: 2015-08-08 13:27:28

Fraud is a term derived from government, in an unregulated market fraud isn't fraud, it's good business. There would be nothing stopping great businessmen from starting up businesses and running away with money when they see fit and doing it all over again because they don't have to disclose being attached to new businesses. Literally standard operating procedure would be start a business, if it runs successfully let it run forever, but the second it sees a downturn just use insider knowledge to gut it ahead of time and let everyone else get fucked. 


What is it with this community *actually* thinking cashflow is by itself a useful financial metric. Have literally none of you taken an accounting course? There is a lot more to a company's financials than cashflow. Non-cash assets, equity and liabilities are kind of fucking important and bitcoin doesn't really help in that regard.

They never created any law, the law already existed and was applicable to bitcoin given how it was written from the onset. Congress actually predicted people would use unpredictable and unique assets to attempt to get around transmission laws and purposely wrote the law to be broad to cover future developments.  


It can be challenged but the challenge would go literally nowhere because in this case there is not really any vagueness in the law to give someone any reasonable grounds to challenge. 


What did I say wrong. My claim was " to enforce the law as they read it **or as directed by the Supreme Court**," which is 100% true and not actually refuted by your youtube video(I do love how much you goobers love to cite youtube videos as primary sources, lol).

Your business has a physical presence there by virute of rendering service to a person there, and whether or not you are obligated is up to authorities and not yourself. Shouting "I'm not obligated" isn't going to help you much if for instance you're in the UK and UK authorities haul you in for not complying with international commerce law.


And your example is a great example of how countries with little in the way of treaties with the US don't bother with international commerce law. By all means hand your money to North Korean businesses, I'm sure it will be safe there. But if you want your money to go to locales where you're likely more trusting of the people living there you're going to be seeing a lot more nations who do have treaties and respect commerce law for international business. 


They do actually. Congress has given them the legal authority to do so *and* the Constitution does allow the executive branch to enforce the law as they read it or as directed by the Supreme Court, and in this case there is literally no reason for the Court to disagree with the interpretation as it is a pretty basic and clear law.

The problem with boiling down 46 pages of legalese to a single sentence is it kind of leaves out the details, and details are kind of everything in law...
"Residents" in this case doesn't refer to people who simply own a home in the state, but people who are actually physically residing there at the time they are being served by said business. 


Well within the US it's pretty simple. There is a lot of framework existing between state governments and the federal government to enforce trade laws across state lines in the case of interstate commerce. 
Outside the US enforcement is done via a series of treaties the US has with other nations. In some cases(eg: UK and US) these treaties are robust and readily enforced and it's common for cooperation between both to enforce each other's laws in international commerce.
 And of course in other cases(eg: US and Turkey) there is little care for the other sides rules and probably no repercussion would exist for an Turkish bitcoin business serving NY customers solely online. Unsurprisingly the nations that so readily disregard law in international trade also tend to be the nations that most people would hesitate with trusting a business centered there with their money.

It really depends on the company. US-Chinese trade law is kind of a mess of give and take. The biggest tool in the US's arsenal is denying a company's goods through customs or fining stateside businesses who do business with a company marked as operating illegally. Additionally on the US side people who choose to do business with unlicensed foreign vendors forfeit a great deal of protections the government would otherwise provide for them should things with said vendor go sour. For example US MtGox users have been mostly shit out of luck for seeing any of their money back since the company folded, in contrast in the last ~7 years we've seen other licensed(foreign and domestic) financial service companies go under but their customer's deposits remained in whole, in large part because the government was willing to provide security for those companies' financials because they had gone through the steps to be licensed.

For unregistered securities you usually must be an accredited investor to purchase them(there's a bunch of exceptions). Think pre-public offering shares, something like providing the initial capital to start a business on day 1.
Accredited investors must demonstrate a sizeable 6 figure income for multiple years to qualify. One big caveat is if you are a partner, executive or director of the start up you automatically qualify as accredited regardless of income. So if your buddy is starting a business and says you can get a fifth of ownership and be CFO if you invest $5,000 that's fine even if your income wouldn't otherwise qualify you. 
The idea behind this is to prevent people from taking advantage of unknowledgeable investors as unregistered securities have a lot less regulatory oversight and a lot more risk. A guy regularly pulling in a quarter million a year is likely going to be tougher to swindle and be able to take a huge financial hit in stride worst case scenario vs some manual laborer with just $3000 in savings who could easily be ruined by someone with rudimentary accounting knowledge pulling wool over his eyes.

The US doesn't necessarily take turns with the parties like clockwork. For instance George HW Bush(Republican) was elected after 8 years of Ronald Reagan(Republican). 
Hillary Clinton is kind of a behemoth politically speaking. Her husband, Bill, presided over a booming economy and a relatively peaceful time for the US. Over the distance of time it has become very, very favorably viewed with many people getting nostalgic over those years. So that association with Bill is a major boon and add in the fact that she's about as well connected politically as is humanly possible and she presents a formidable candidate. As it stands now odds makers have her and Democrats as favorites. 
That being said the election is very, very, very far off politically speaking. A *lot* can and will happen in the next year and a half so what the picture looks like today could be radically different by then. It's very possible Republicans get a candidate in there who can win it, but they have their work cut out for them going toe to toe with a Clinton.

Here is the actual IRS guidance on bitcoin. They call it currency like a dozen times. 
**You don't seem to understand that the actual tax code ratified by Congress makes no special tax treatment for "currency."** The only special treatment in the code is specifically for "foreign currency" which is defined as being issued by another nation. When something has no explicit treatment in the tax code it simply gets general treatment which the IRS uses the shorthand "property treatment" to convey.

That's not really how ownership works legally. Legally speaking since MtGox wasn't offering or practicing allocated accounts and was instead treating deposits as fungible then it did in fact legally own deposits. What clients owned was a liability claim against MtGox. This is a pretty standard legal treatment seen globally regarding financial services providers.

This model failed... There's a reason why we don't see it, the market spoke and decided it was shitty compared to the alternative.

Largely because they aren't of much value. Historically the country has been small in size and population, lacked much industrial capacity, and been fairly bereft of good natural resources. Germany for instance fully intended to invade Switzerland in WWII and had the plans drawn up and everything, but it was simply put near the bottom of their list since the country had very little strategic value, so they couldn't justify an invasion until after they brought down the USSR and UK, which luckily for the Swiss people never happened.

People prefer it as well, which is why they, the market, have spurned full reserve banking and opted for fractional for centuries.

They didn't really make it anything. They said treat it like property for tax purposes, they didn't declare what it is. 
The Internal Revenue Code only really provides tax treatments for three asset classes. There's precious metals (eg: gold), foreign currencies, and everything else.
Since bitcoin isn't a precious metal, and isn't a foreign issued national currency then it falls into the everything else category.
It's baffling to me how so many on this sub are intent on being misinformed and confused about something so damn rudimentary

Well, also non-client liabilities and non-cash assets. It seems like people don't realize that exchanges have more liabilities than just client accounts. Employees, hardware, utiliities, insurance, buildings etc etc aren't free and can certainly cause a company to be insolvent without making the bitcoin reserves appear low compared to client accounts.

How so? If an organization uses bitcoin on a day to day basis there's really no way to make it perfectly secure without severely compromising usability to the point where it makes more sense to just use the old system. 
Even in the case that it's a stash that is generally untouched and can be kept away from the internet you do realize we're talking about a terrorist organization that has no qualms literally tearing people apart right?

By the time Bank of Amsterdam switched it wasn't really using gold as a medium of exchange, it was using coinage and banknotes. And those islam banks weren't using gold as an exchange unit at all. So, I'm not quite sure how those stories say anything about gold. 


It was because they were rapidly losing business to competitors. The free market was voting them out. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 11:56:36
The Bank of Amsterdam began in the 1600s as a full reserve bank. They stayed that way for awhile when they were the only bank around, until of course competitors sprang up offering fractional reserve banking and the free market decided that was a much better system and people began rushing to those other banks, so the BoA was forced to change to fractional reserve lest they go out of business. 
Islam, as in the religion, *requires* full reserve banking, and many Mideast banks have tried it in order to adhere to the religion, but they've all failed because they simply can't offer the value that traditional bank systems have and people simply avoid them. Not even religious decree has been able to sway a market to full reserve banking.
Isn't it pretty evident which system the free market prefers via the fact that only one type of bank has ever really won out every single time?

MtGox wasn't really a FRB. A FRB still has a balanced budget, for every dollar missing in its reserves they have a creditor that owes them a dollar back. MtGox on the other hand wasn't operating as this, they were meaning to be a full reserve but had their vault emptied so they had no creditors accounting for their gap in reserves.
