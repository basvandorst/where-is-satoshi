I'll look into the downsides, thanks for the tip!

I've taken all your advice and [this]( is the updated version of my presentation. I'm willing to add more information if I've missed anything, so I'd love it if I could get more feedback!
I do have a lot of notes, so I will cover most bullet points in more detail.

I'll cut down on the words used.
Thanks for clearing that up, I was confused when I saw it capitalized in some texts and not capitalized in others.

I'm the only guy in the class and I seriously doubt that any of the girls would be interested in owning bitcoin...

Unfortunately, I'm presenting this to a class of about 5 students... Also, I'm trying to focus on the economic concepts, since it's for an Econ class.
Your idea is great nevertheless and I can only imagine the reaction you'd get from a big crowd if you actually did that!

I will say that any form of money can be used for illegal practices, I guess that's an appropriate answer. Thanks anyway!
@_date: 2014-09-10 19:56:00
I agree.

That video is really good! We were actually taught about barter just a couple of days ago, so this will lead to an interesting conversation with my teacher.
Good point about the mining, I've moved it to the end.
Didn't know about the fees being independent, thanks. Actually, it's the first time I'm researching Bitcoin, so I'm a total newbie and still don't have a good grasp of all concepts related to it. I mentioned it in class, my teacher didn't know much about it and asked me to do a presentation. I'm trying to focus on the economic characteristics of Bitcoin.
I have an extra slide with stuff related to my country, but I didn't know about coinmap, thanks for the link.

Thanks, fixed it!

I'm in Europe and the ones I added are the ones Europeans know about, haha. I'll add Dell, though. Thanks!

Thanks for listing them, it will be much easier for me to research!

Thanks! I've updated the presentation with what I gathered from the comments here. Do you think [this]( looks/works better?
