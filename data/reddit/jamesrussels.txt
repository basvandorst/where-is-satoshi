I thought Bitcoin wasn't supposed to have a central point of failure.  Is there something I'm missing here? 
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:56:06
Yeah I'm just an idiot, it was the receiving wallet that was the problem. :) 
@_date: 2018-09-06 19:08:26
I think it's because it's not synced with the blockchain (says 5% and something about February). We haven't confirmed that yet - the sync button was greyed out so I figured that might have been due to a lack of a wifi connection or something similar, since that would potentially be a lot of data to download. She's going to try syncing when she gets home and will let me know. I'll update here when I know more. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 21:24:32
It was - that's how I figured out it was the receiving wallet. Hence me being an idiot haha.

Also, Coinbase's own help section mentions too low of a fee as being a reason for a stuck transaction.

Credit is essentially a loan. The cryptocurrency argument is usually in favor of payments and financial autonomy. They are completely different. You could use cryptocurrency to pay off the balance on a credit card, which could be tracked via a blockchain and could be managed and automated via smart contracts. 
If by "credit" you meant something like a credit score, there are already blockchain-based identity solutions emerging (one I'm aware of is called Civic). I would imagine that something like this could track your credit score automatically based on how reliably you pay off the balances on the aforementioned smart contracts.

Derp, I should have done that first.  It had confirmed, but BRD was having issues syncing. Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-09-06 18:40:07
Maybe not. I'm asking for a friend so I'm not quite sure what she did. But the transaction is stuck... If it wasn't the fee, what else could it be? The receiving wallet sees the transaction so I'm not sure.
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:17:16
I have no idea.  That answers my question though, this would be done through the wallet.  Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:40:43
Ok thanks.  If I did want to use RBF, how would I?

He's turning a blind eye to the hotter one? 
@_date: 2018-10-25 21:30:20
Speak for yourself xD
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:17:00
Why does BTC need to be only for trading and investing though?  Isn't more throughput on the blockchain a good thing?  Trader, investor, or user- no one wants to be spending more than they have to in fees, right? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:00:26
Lol what are you talking about.  Please tell me how I am any of these things. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:30:18
What do they mean "Deposits can take several hours to process"? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:18:34
I agree completely.  On chain scaling is a must, and will allow second layer solutions to be that much better.  Having options is never a bad thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:26:11
But is it itself fraudulent? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:47:18
Woah there, getting a little rustled there.  Last I checked, Bitcoin Cash was doing just fine with 8MB blocks.  Did something happen I was unaware of?
For the record, I agree with you about decentralization.  That's why I'm all-in on Bitcoin Gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:52:40
Oh I'm sorry, I'm relatively new and that is what I had been told. What was 2x meant to do?  And I thought on-chain scaling referred to increasing the block size. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:05:13
But isn't it a fact that a small increase in block size won't have a significant negative impact?
I had not heard of those two arguments and I spent a decent amount of time at the btc subreddit, so that is interesting to me.  I agree though, that seems incorrect.
I think when they say BCH is bitcoin, they mean it is functioning as Bitcoin originally did, with low fees.  I think once the small block size has equal transaction capacity and low fees, that statement will cease to be accurate.
My main confusion is, what is the reason for resisting a reasonable block size increase so that the network isn't congested at least until reliable layer 2 solutions can be implemented? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:27:45
I've heard that payment channels could result in centralization as well.  Is this true?
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:16:50
Yeah it's unfortunate, I agree that side is pretty biased.  Unfortunately, the small block side is also biased, and this subreddit is where people are more likely to first arrive and get their information.  I wish we could all just discuss diplomatically.
Out of curiosity what do you feel is being marketed fraudulently?
@_date: 2019-04-19 05:52:12
It shouldn't matter and it's probably for the best if we never know.
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:03:22
Yes, the fact that I would have had to pay a $7.48 fee on a $70 transaction.  Do you have any evidence to support that on-chain scaling is detrimental?
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:34:22
Buddy why you so angry? 
@_date: 2019-04-19 05:58:04
Every single one of not you us is Satoshi Nakamoto.
@_date: 2019-04-19 05:55:58
December 12, 2010. Saying anything would be antithetical to some of the key principles of Bitcoin, so it's unlikely anything would ever be said, if they're even still around.
@_date: 2019-04-16 14:26:08
Itt people who are mad at a service who is probably doing this out of necessity to comply with regulations.
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:18:54
@_date: 2017-05-08 14:37:24
The part after 3:10 seems relevant too.
