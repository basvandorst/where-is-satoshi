yes that was what I was trying to say.  Fractional reserve banking is basically a legalized fraud.   It is not correct to call it a ponzi scheme, however. There is no advantage to early investors.    
A U.S. dollar and any other fiat currency that is not supported by a responsible fiscal policy IS a ponzi scheme, of course, but not the fractional reserve.
So.. it is a fraud, but a necessary fraud.  Transaction volume in modern economy cannot be supported by narrow (real) money, because fiat currency cannot circulate efficiently, the point OP had so well illustrated.  This is why this discussion started here.
Bitcoin would greatly increase transaction speed and make it unnecessary to create fictitious money supply.  I think it would be much better financial system.

there is one more thing they did not mention unless I missed something.  Bitcoin can also be used for document validation and recordkeeping, by using message to carry a payload, say a document hash.  Sort of like a notary seal.  Internationally recognized notary seals can cost as much as $20.  This is intrinsic value of a Bitcoin transaction not bit coin as unit.

it is a limited market, with asymmetrical ownership, meaning that very few traders control most of the market, no wonder it is volatile.  It is also impossible to regulate.  
Which is exactly why it is so much fun and so useful and will continue to attract new players.  Which will reduce volatility and make manipulation more difficult.

There had been a lot of talk in Russia lately about restricting transactions in foreign currencies inside Russia and establishing internal payment system to replace of VISA/MasterCard.  All that is prompted by xenophobia and sanctions.
So.. If you read it in the context of what is going on in Russia right now and from an RT which basically represents official government position this is definitely a very good news.  Practically an endorsement.
I think it is only a matter of time, bitcoin is ideal for Russia in many ways, there is  fresh memory of bank crashes and double digit inflation.  good infrastructure with wireless broadband coverage everywhere.  Also, Russians are used to adopting new technology very quickly.  I think we will see widespread use of crypto currency in Russia by the end of the decade.

I think it is positive development.  May be not good for miners and  investors, but I think it is a result of increasing acceptance, i.e. use in retail transactions.  When bitcoin is used in retail purchases it is automatically sold to convert it to fiat currency, which drives the exchange rate down.  
It will be some time before business to business transactions will catch up to retail, until then we may expect further decline.
@_date: 2014-04-30 03:35:12
you are probably right, this could be considered as payment processing.  But bitcoin is not a currency according to IRS it is property, so technically giving someone a bitcoin is not a purchase it is barter.  I do not know enough to say for sure what will happen but it is safer to just make a giftcard, and then barter giftcard for bitcoin.

I have been expecting something like this. Moore's curve has its limit.  Silicon wafers layers can only get that thin.  At some point we hit the limit on density due to heat dissipation.   It actually happened in mainline processors a year or two back and now ASIC chips have reached the limit.
Next step is quantum computers, probably 10-50 years ahead

I was hoping some small island state will step forward and adopt bitcoin as an official state currency, this would solve a lot of problems. No bill of congress would be necessary if bitcoin was already a currency in some foreign state, right?

it is no different from someone paying with money order. only faster. you get instant notification that money is sent.  and buyer has a record.  very easy to prove if there is a dispute.  eBay dispute resolution is still there and seller is not likely to screw buyers anyway.
It is all hypothetical because no one used it yet. 
depends on what you are selling of course.  some expensive items may benefit from escrow.  may be a good revenue source for eBay.

good idea.  I think every school should do something like this. 
In fact here is even a better idea: have grad students write a whole new protocol, scrypt based, call it after the school mascot for example and make cafeteria accept nothing else.   Have the system start with a base valued at about a monthly cafeteria turnaround and sell them to students as a meal plan at some fixed rate. After initial start up amount just let students mine them.  And of course re-sell them monthly for dollars. Dollars go to cafeteria.     
Saves transaction fees they are paying on mag strip cafeteria cards to some bank and boosts school identity.

I think it is great idea.  It is like a 1:100000000 split of a stock.  It might actually help to move the value up a bit.  Eventually as Bitcoin becomes widely accepted the value of a "bit" will increase somewhat making prices look less Japanese and more European, with fewer zeroes.

I am assuming it was a check deposit if so, we should also consider the time for the check to be mailed to you.  the real transaction length is actually much longer.   
now, if you assume, say a 6% APR on investment, then a 5 days delay on $10k is costing you $8 in lost interest, which is of course collected by a bank.  I am not sure if this is your bank or the bank which the check was written on, but someone gets the money.  Not you.  This is a form of theft in my opinion.

well, it was a slight exaggeration, in theory a bank can have about 33 times more money loaned than they have on the balance.  Normally they do not do this, an average for U.S. is actually less than 10 dollars in loans and bank issued papers for each dollar they have in the bank.  Number 33 is simply the 3% minimum reserve requirement (applied to smaller banks)

"double spending" is much too mild of a term.  smaller U.S. banks are allowed to operate on as little as 3% reserves, only larger ones are required to maintain 10%. And this does not even take into account short term fed loans.  Banks can loan all of their "reserves" from the fed  and have no real money at all.    
They "spend" every dollar you put in the bank 33 times or more.
This banking system is the largest scam in history of mankind.

Every item will have to be RFID'd and pre-packed.  If many items are prepared daily, it is a lot of work.  labor required to do that is probably greater than that required to man checkout register. 
I think in cafeteria bar codes or QR codes with either attended or self check out is the best solution.  Self check out is probably best.  It is very common, especially in Europe.  Checkout with scale will allow for self served by weight items.  
Bitcoin payment is of course the easiest part

I do not see the numbers you mentioned in data.  However, the question is an interesting one.
The way I look at this, there are two factors that increase hashrate: computing power and investment in mining. The former is easy, it is known to increase exponentially and should level off to Moore's 5%/month, which of course is "flat" compared to neck breaking 26% current rate.  ASIC technology is still catching up to mainstream processing technology.   I think we are about 3-4 development cycles (6-8 months) away from ASICs becoming as mature as, say, Intel chips. So.. I give it 18-32 months to drop from 30% to 5%/month.  I am not making any bets though.  If you lose money on that expensive 2TH rig you bought don't blame me.
The later (investment) is hard to predict, however, it should be linked to the exchange rate.  Therefore it is irrelevant if you are mostly interested in real world (dollar equivalent) of mining ROI.
So.. the answer is yes, in my uneducated opinion, the growth will probably remain exponential but the rate will probably decrease somewhat in line with Moore's law. There is some evidence of this in the data if you make corrections for some large one time events such as Cointerra, KnC, etc.
