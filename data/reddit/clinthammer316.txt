Hodling on to everything anticipating some more silly FUD before wall street get their fat bonuses and buy when the price is low. Sadly not much can be done to stop these whales :( :(

Since futures expires every month from Jan until March is this going to be the norm around the time they expire i.e. prices dip?
At this rate the value of BTC will be eroded further or am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:58:17
no worries. A lot of people posting the same. Hopefully it will be true with no ban and just govt wanting their share of $$$

Hodling here stressed out like a Lil bitch :) :)  but to be fair this is bigger than the Chinese FUD. May take a little while longer to pick up pace to the top since the fees are shitting on purchasing power.

The longer you hodl the more intense the orgasm.
Seriously just hodl. All my buddies around me called me asking why it's crashing despite daily advise I give them to hodl. So today I just hung up on them

Bought in at 16.5 and held. Nerve racking days but too good to miss out. Engines are warmed up this is gonna be one heck of a night. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:15:24
I can see us getting back up there but probably will take a bit longer (not a problem if you have balls of steel)
I'm surprised BCH didn't tank more as I see it's value is still hovering around the $3.5k mark.

Puking, cold sweats, crapping your pants, losing your cool, lump in your throat... It's all part of hodling. Btc has gone through this monthly FUD and will survive. 
Keep hodling buddy!

Been through 4 dips now since Aug and this one was by far an ass ripper. Trigger finger was so ready to sell but I decided to shut off my phone and take out my frustration on killzone 3. Came back a few hours later to see there were survivors. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:24:45
predicting how much it will dip is like trying to hold your piss in for as long as you can while trying to get home in rush hour traffic
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:12:08
I am selling a kidney to buy during this dip. When I profit I will buy my kidney back.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:45:35
Remember when it dropped to US$5500 during the BCASH attempted heist less than a month ago :P.... everyone around me was saying BTC crashing.
When I tell them its US$12k now I want to include a bitchslap sadly HODLers don't condone violence :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:40:43
I hodled my BTC but I couldn't hodl my bowels. Does that count? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:40:41
Can someone summarize whats happening with COinbase and BCH selling - selling blocked until they establish liquidity?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:57:56
11. People who call it a bubble are idiots who have no knowledge or experience with/of bitcoin other than what they read on the Internet.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:23:25
I sold one kidney to buy a few BTC. If you wanna be a hardcore hodler top that.

it was 275 then it went up to 277 - anyone able to explain why?

I'm scared this dip is going to end soon. Engines are getting warmed up and once the races begin it will be another sleepless set of nights watching the $$$ ticker explode.

Invest 390 in whatever you like. 10 should go on popcorn because this shit show by BCH is very entertaining especially when people are allowed to sell and it drops to the floor faster than a stripper given a gold bar as a tip

Long term HODL'er here :)  With BCH being traded now on GDAX it is possible that it will take longer for BTC to reach 20k?

I woke up about 4 hours ago at 2am and it still hadn't crossed 10k. Then fell asleep only an hour later still didn't cross.
Woke up 10 mins ago (6am UAE time) and I missed the historic moment :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:33:16
Lessons learned post (for newbs / panick sellers etc):
* HODL
* Majority of posts supporting BCH in this reddit are scare mongering tactics
* Fee free to add to this everyone.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:19:53
I've bought all the way from $3500 up till $9200.
No wonder I can't sleep with this HODLING :P

Thank you very much. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:16:53
I woke up twice - once to see the time when the difficulty adjustment would occur for BCH and next time cuz I dreamed BTC tanked to $1 lolz. Am a HODLER btw!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:19:59
Just keep in mind that once these sites come back up the price may very well go up with fomo buying 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:22:03

Perhaps they were absent so that they could make one last attempt on dethroning BTC. Whatever the case wish they sod off a.s.a.p. because HODLers will HODL!

Oh and not to mention Coinbase past spamming as a valid reason.

Do not buy at this ath. It will dip in a few days by at least $500. I've seen it happen over and over since last September

I have been into BTC trading only since Aug of 2017 and been through the couple of scary dips so far. All I know if for sure that not a single soul on this reddit knows what will happen tomorrow or Monday be it a bigger dip or rise past 12k.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:01:59
I wish I could spear them like Goldberg did.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:54:38

Only two months into the game but I will hodl. Everyone around me talking shit that all major crypto like BTC ETH is going to tank. Funny enough these people are Mia now after it rising today
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:42:50
Ive been holding Ethereum for a while but bought bitcoin two days ago at the start of the dip. I saw it fall further and almost cashed out but I had the stomach for it and stayed put. Glad to see the correction over soon and in it for the long run now :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:36:46
Feck it jumped from 5k to 13k in a few days

@_date: 2018-02-04 12:34:09
Yes thank you! I thought it would be nice to post about something other than "OMG its falling someone call 911"... I'm sure long time hodlers do the same now with such dips.

Speaking as newbie I follow my own gut.
I invested in BTC only at the beginning of Sept. First with small amounts when it was roughly @ 4600 then dipped to 3900 and even recently at 5700.
I sold just once and re-invested the profit. Even right now if I choose to sell I can make a profit of $1300 but gut says to hodl.
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:31:01
I sold a kidney to buy some BTC.

Been hodling since September 2017. Since Dec decline I've been checking about once a week. Went away on vacation for about two weeks and pretty stoked it's gone up by over USD 2k
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:43:29
When it was at 6k yesterday people were only going to buy when it went lower. Today when it's past 8k people are swearing they will buy at 6k. These people need to be taken to the back and shot once and then shot again for good measure. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:01:50
shot up approx $200 in seconds. Go baby go
