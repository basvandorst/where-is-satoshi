Good one
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:34:10
This shit will never stick! They are going to need to compile a database from EVERY miner out there. Honestly? That is IMPOSSIBLE. How will they distinguish international coins from domestic coins. NO WAY&gt;
@_date: 2014-06-14 13:43:00
Great! Got 3 tips already!!!
@_date: 2014-07-16 18:43:08
AND FINALLY...

Ahhahaha. My friend. I spend 25+ hours a week on public transportation. Let's not go there.
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:56:39
Pretty much legit. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 16:46:37
Coinbase is donezooooo
@_date: 2014-05-06 18:13:16
Thanks. I know this. I am simply restating and observing that the Human Resources industry is now needing to familiarize itself with Bitcoin for payroll purposes!
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:05:22

I mean, the plus side of this all is that the IRS will soon be hiring. There is no way that they hope to establish this extremely complicated audit system without community insider assistance. I doubt the enforcement of this will be very strong for us non-millionaire bitholders. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:41:53
Damnnnnnnnnnnnm this shit just got serious
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:39:16
I mean...I get it. I really do, the promotion has a budget. But why not give a specific # (ex. Coinbase now offering $10 to 25,000 .edu student accounts created this week). Why limit it to top 500? I guess these parents want their kids to get $10...after all...they do pay $30,000++ in tuition.
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:41:40
If only!
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:55:02

He didn't even answer the last alt coin question. Wall Street feels like it's too late for Bitcoin. They want and always have wanted the next best thing. Wall Street wants to invest in ALT COINS. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:17:24
I agree. My personal feeling on merchant involvement is that without a solid broad network of merchants, Bitcoin will just be a unit of barter, not really caring about the Bitcoin value, but just its USD/EURO/YEN value. We need to associate goods to solid Bitcoin prices and progress adoption across the board.
@_date: 2014-06-25 01:34:05
ohhhh too soon
@_date: 2014-05-09 19:44:35
Wow. Ahhahaha
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:29:01
Not true. It is not limited to BTC, rather all Virtual Currencies
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:53:37

What the fuck. 1 wallet?
@_date: 2014-05-15 12:41:52
I wonder how Paypal feels about this
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:47:20
As I said, at the moment, we are definitely concentrating on local sales. However, we are looking to expand using the Bitcoin community as a platform to expand and reach out to different demographics. We want to help start ups furnish their new leased/rented locations. We offer affordable options for the business owner of any type, and want to be a part of the growth!
Thanks for the suggestions!
@_date: 2014-06-22 14:00:55
5% is a bit ridiculous but when you are talking about a very TINY market, especially Sri Lankan real estate... It is reasonable for any BTC sale commission fee.
@_date: 2014-06-16 19:30:53
Über needs to accept bitcoin with like a 5% discount. Fuck paypal.
@_date: 2014-05-01 12:33:43
What is Bitcoin? Sounds so 2010. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:39:27

That's irrelevant. I could post under the name Brad Pitt. Does that mean I am the actual human behind the name. Believe it or not, people of intelligence and power tend to want to stay anonymous. Not only does it feed their ego more than being known but it is a way to stay untraceable and unaccountable for a potential collapse. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 12:43:56
Why do they force you to create coinbase? Sucks but still...if you have lost a privkey to cold/ hot wallet, you can still 100% recover funds. Plus more member registration helps Bitcoin and Coinbase in the end because the more members using coinbase, the more VCs will express interest.

I'm in 
@_date: 2014-05-06 17:55:08
Wow. I have never even heard of these guys. Thats pretty neat. I feel like there are definitely high fees. Is it a flat rate per employees or a % on transaction processing.
What about a BTC&gt;USD payroll escrow service? Any exist? 
@_date: 2014-05-11 13:28:29
Is this reddit or the onion?
@_date: 2014-06-06 09:17:38
The event has been posted a few times on this sub reddit. I have also seen the billboard on the 495 in queens. It has been there for well over 6 months.
I will be in attendance next weekend.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:39:16
Don't forget to keep a log either.

Not everyone of us 125,000 are completely anti-bank anti-gov. It's possible to coexist and it must to succeed at this point
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:54:29
The IRS is now involved, lets hope it doesn't get to the SEC or FTC

I mean, it depends on the shirt. Ahhahahaha
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:33:04
I am still trying to figure out if this is the best or worst thing ever. This backbone of legitimacy is exactly what the system needed. Evading taxes was impossible, as 80% of the world's nations will follow the US's action on Virtual taxes. Maybe this government involvement will promote trade and give confident to the real trillionares out there who are looking to move currency fast with a bracketed "capital gain" tax price tag. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 20:22:37
I doubt it. By inflating the sale prices of bitcoin by a few cents or dollars per trade, they will be able to make a small profit in the difference to actual value.
@_date: 2014-03-26 02:59:02
No. Gold has no value

Is it possible to purchase a tiger, directly with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-02 15:51:24
I am looking for some input from avid users. What do you think the best method is for me to reach out to new Bitcoin funded start ups nationwide and let them know, "hey, we are here to help not only you, but the community and the progression of the Bitcoin economy". What other platforms besides Reddit do you suggest?
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:30:01
How could this be liked. Will US markets need to be registered and will trading be recorded and reported to the IRS?
There will need to be an entire new branch of the IRS.

Hey. I received an email from the official legal team in Philly and I called them today. I was told that I have to send in my tax and identification documentation and there will be a final settlement in q1 of 2018. I asked about inquiring my balance and they told me it was class action, all crypto balances are unknown and the final settlement is unknown. I am sure the settlement will be divided into the amount of defendants...
