I'm really not savy at all with computers.
I backup my keys on Lastpass, which is very secure behind my two-factor authentication with yubikey and impossible to guess 40-100 character password (not saying how many characters! :D)
I also use iDrive to backup, free up to 5gb, end to end encryption, nsa-proof.
Then I backup everything on a truecrypt container.
Easy enough to do for someone as dumb as I am with computers.

Exactly, when serious capital starts flowing into BTC, by the tens of billions if not more...the price is literally going to go to the moon.

Yeah, generally all my passwords are at least 50 characters generated by LastPass, I don't know if that would be considered high-entropy or not though, since it's just random.
Is there any software you recommend that is particularly good at finding keyloggers? I can't imagine locating a keylogger would be difficult, just a program which knows if the inputted keys are going to another process?
I think like you said, to make myself feel completely safe, so I don't experience the horror that OP has gone through.. Is to buy a separate netbook with network access completely revoked, truecrypt it, and just store my crap on there.

Can I ask your opinion on what I'm doing with MultiBit...
I use one wallet for sending and receiving payments only, keep no more than 3 BTC in there.
Then I use another wallet for storage only. I only pay myself from the 'payments' wallet.
Is this smart or does it not really matter anyway?
