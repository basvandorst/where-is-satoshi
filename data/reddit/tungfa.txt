i think he (incl the whole Dev Team) should put his ego to the side, finally increase the block size and keep the fees low (as they are supposed to be / hence Satochi paper).
i know you do not wanna hear this but Dash with Instant Transactions has this sorted out since a long time !
Sabotaging 'your' own industry will not bring your point accross, only confuse and scare (even more) future investors !

I am an altcoin supported,
and i agree with many posts, that there is a huge mess of scams giving the Altcoin world a bad rep. 
the biggest propel is people believe it is easier to make money in 'New coins' than maintaining 'old coins', that 1st pump, everybody gets on and the coin dies after. and next week, next coin, horrible, scam after scam after BS.
I was at a BTC Conference the other day, and that was exactly what i heard in most speeches.
But we (Altcoins) are learning from the best (BTC) and are improving onto their mistakes ! Btc is 5 year old tech and definitely needs some upgrades. 
Check Dash, Anonymity and Speed ! try to do that with BTC, good luck getting that fork approved for implementation (as too big and none flexible by now). With Dash we (evan) invented the spork, which makes forking much easier and none threatening.
(i think we had 10-12 forks last year alone)
Over the next 6 months the big Altcoin dying will start (as the market just can not maintain so many tiny coins + they can Not maintain their development) that will mean even more Crapcoins will start to make some money for day traders in the 1st pump, + the old big Altcoins will and have to sort out their funding, as this is not the sprint we all thought, it is a Marathon which has not even started yet.
Good that Dash has it's "Self-sustained Decentralised Governance by Blockchain" in place and is ready for the future !

This whole debate shows you perfectly the complexity of this 'anonymity' issue. People just do not do enough research on their own, they here something in the media and actually believe it. BTC private ? Come on, since Silkroad everybody should understand the issues in this comment !
Privacy matters, i think latest since Snowden the last person understands that much. 
i do not wanna start up the whole Annon Race discussion (i can see pips are already in the starting blocks for that/ in comments)
all i can say, check the Coin Market Cap for Anon Coins, 
there are very few survivors, and only 1 under the top 10 ! Do your research and take it from there if you are concerned (as you should be) about your financial privacy..

Good read
and yes, definitely possible.
It will take a while but it will come. BTC is 5 year old tech, the core team STILL biggering around even over the block size (i mean come on) , splitting team and heads by now. They should really pull themselves to gather and get to work as eventually this will really hurt all of crypto ! (as the bankers love that kind of 'negative' PR)
For altcoins in general, there is a lot of work to do, not tech wise, but community wise, check the FUD'sters bellow, suggest any Coin and you will hit a storm of FUD and TROLLING !
THIS will hurt the industry more than the none development of BTC as big new investors are scared off the Altmarkets all together.
Mention Dash ... and see what will happen in the comment section ! (FUD-Troll-FUD-TROLL- Nonsense) We as communities from different coins have to pull ourself together and stop this nonsense as it will HURT ALL OF US !
Check the AMA on bitcoin.com these days, it is hilarious to see these answers from the BTC Core Team !
as 90% of suggestions/ideas/.... code wise are solved already !
@_date: 2018-04-29 01:20:51
really ... did u just figure this out ? ; )
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:02:37
exactly my though
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:39:09
tiny buttons , tiny display ... trezor solved that all much better and easier - maybe i have fat fingers but getting that password into a ledger is a huge pain 
trezor has a telegram chat group - great support - always available and helpful 
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:09:54
weird title and calculation 
so compared to ripple it should be a million bucks then ? lol
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:04:27
