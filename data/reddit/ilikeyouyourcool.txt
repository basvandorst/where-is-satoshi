Then they didnt have a life savings to be inflated away by an irresponsible goverment and therefore nothing to hedge against. At that point I assume  building a bitcoin savings account would be standard practice in areas of economic instability.

By the time bitcoin challenges governments on any significant level it will be woven so deeply into their economic tapestry that removing it will be like pulling a thread from a knitted sweater. The things is; There's a lot of money to be made through facilitating bitcoin and big business wants their slice of the pie so it's likely that it will evolve to the point that outlawing the currency would bring economic powerhouses to their knees thus making it too big to fail. 
If you want to destroy something that may one day threaten your existence you do it while its young and weak. In bitcoins case however individual governments cannot destroy it. Any nation who turns their back exposes themselves to the potential of a finacial shift in power if universal adoption is ever established. 
This is why the U.S stockpiles gold and oil and has an arangement with Saudi arabia (in exchange for protection) to only accept USD. 
Money is power and If bitcoin ever becomes what it is intended to be competing goverments will not be caught with their pants down. 
In summation; Game theory ensures bitcoins survival.
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:43:01
The idea is that you preemptively trade fiat for bitcoin as a hedge against inflation before it goes parabolic; saving you from the government essentially stealing your lifes savings.  You don't wait until its already happened.

It could make for a good store of value though. Once volatility has substantially decreased it would be a good way to store value thats immune to inflation. 
The way I see it pannng out is having a spending account you "top up" like putting cash in your wallet but no need for an ATM. 
Eventually credit cards, debit cards and cash will be unescasary and people will no longer carry physical  wallets.
Your phone is your daily camera, gps, music device, mobile computer, alarm,  flashlight,  etc.  Integrating the usefulness of the contents of your wallet is next. 
Blockchain mobile identification; drivers license, School ID's. Cash, credit cards etc.

Many people misundersrand our national debt. We paid 276 billion in interest on our debt last year and our GDP was 19 Trillion. 
Thats 1.4 % of the united states total income paid out in interest. 
Now lets pretend you make 50k a year and only pay 1.4% on your borrowed money. House, car, credit cards, etc.
Thats equivalent to the interest of all your loans costing you only $58 a month or $700 a year. Thats pretty managable when you make 50k.
While our national debt is now surpassing our gdp we're not on some crash course to despair.

Theres money to be made in facilitating crypto. Therefore businesses have been and will continue to be built around it. Its as simple as that.

People dont really see btc as a currecy any longer. It was suposed to be but  scaling issues have lended to adoption  of the idea of it being a crypto asset or store of value akin to gold. But you knew all of that already. My point is that btc doesnt need to drop in price because its an asset not a currency.
I find it strange that anyone who owned btc years ago doesnt hold any today as most people I know invest in the mid to long term and trade in the short. 
Me tor example, am still holding a sizeable multi year investment long while buying and selling along the way.

Seems to me that the system they are considering is a energy consumption tracking tool utilizing microtrasactions which are device specific. This way they are able to track how much energy their big freezers, coolers, and whatever else are using individually rather than an entire stores energy cost data being clumped together. This way they can pinpoint energy cost per specific unit down to the penny allowing them to reduce energy costs where needed. Once they have a working product they will then sell access to their power managment  system to other big name retailers.

Id rather buy on an exchange because of cost but thats besides the point. There is no way I get tracked down if I purchase crypto with cash from one of these machines. It's simply not possible. The only scenario where you get tracked is if they are able to video track you to your car and get your plate. But even then whats the point? They dont know how much crypto you're storing on paper wallets. It doesnt make sense to be afraid of big brother watching you because of these machines.

@_date: 2019-10-17 03:32:38
I see your point.  In order for any cryptocurrency to become widely used for daily transactions it would have to absorb a large percentage of fiat or be pegged to an underlying asset.
Bitcoin has been absorbing fiat for 10 years and has the largest, most secure decentralized network. The problem facing any new coin is the network effect.
The vast majority of crypto users, programmers, miners and various other businesses are heavily invested in supporting bitcoin and just like with Bcash they're not just going to hop over to support a "better" faster coin.
Any coin with the properties of bitcoin ( Open, Public, Borderless, Neutral, Censorship resistant) Would be considered an attack on bitcoin and would be met with heavy resistance. There are already dozens of coins with better features than Bitcoin and they've all amounted to shit.
Any new coin won't be ignored for years and years like bitcoin was so it won't be able to build a network strong enough to resist a 51% attack. That's why so many new networks use POS instead of POW.
The only way I can conceive of a new coin emerging vs. continuing to build 2nd and 3rd layer solutions on Bitcoin is if somehow the network is compromised and the majority of miners agree to move to the new coin.
As far as speed and cost of transactions -
I suspect bitcoin will follow a similar path to the internet in regards to transaction speed and cost
When I first discovered the internet it was 1992 and youtube, netflix, pornhub and other various streaming sites didn't exist. The reason they didn't exist is the internet was to slow and not enough people used it. You could download a video but it took to long and for most people wasn't worth it.
Engineers worked the problem until we could stream 256 then 512 then 1080, and now most people are streaming at 4k AND IT'S CHEAP. It didn't happen overnight and the number of users continued to increase while the problem was being sorted and now your grandmother streams online.
Is it possible something overtakes bitcoin? Sure. Is it likely? No
There are literally hundreds of Billions invested in the success of Bitcoin. Not to mention the infrastructure and branding built around it.
So yes, Bitcoin is digital gold (For now) but soon enough transactions will be lightning fast, very cheap and easy enough for grandma to use.
It's still possible; but my opinion is that bitcoin would have to somehow be compromised and given the amount of dedicated resources and highly educated technicians its not likely that it ever will be.

That's not replacing Bitcoin... That's a block chain based system that will move Fiat (Infinitely printable government money ) faster and cheaper than the current system. You'll love XRP... That's not what bitcoin is.
Bitcoin is digital gold that the government cannot control with the added benefit of transferring large sums of value anywhere in the world for less than the cost of ordering a pizza and in about the same time.
Unless you're making a substantial purchase (Car, Truck, Home, Yacht) Using Bitcoin doesn't make sense but if you are it's absolutely the best option.
Even if Bitcoin doesn't surpass golds marketcap and only becomes equivalent it will skyrocket in value
Gold = 7Trillion
Bitcoin 200Billion
7 trillion / 200 billion = 35x = BTC $280,000
AND thats if it only matches gold. Bitcoin is Gold 2.0 so it may be worth as much as double = 70x = $560,000
It will take years and we will see several booms and busts but over the next ten years bitcoin will do amazing things.
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:27:13
The only way anything will ever take the place of bitcoin is if the actual blockchain is compromised. hundreds of coins have been created with better features but as long as bitcoin remains secure It doesn't matter. If the day ever comes where the bitcoin network is hacked and funds are stolen a giant selloff will take place and only then will another coin be able to obtain market dominance. Bitcoin can remain to slow and expensive for day to day transactions and it won't matter. As long as it remains secure it's not going anywhere. The longer bitcoin remains secure the more valuable it becomes and the more valuable it becomes the more secure it becomes. Bells and whistles don't matter. Bitcoin only needs to be good at one thing and so far it's proven to do that very well.  I'm not a maximalist and own other coins but none that are trying to replace bitcoin.

I dont see bitcoin as currency. It works better as a store of value that can be easily tranfered.  It doesnt make sense (yet) as currency for coffe and shit. Maybe someday we'll use litecoin for daily items and bitcoin for big ticket items.

It's about familiarity. Not some overwhelming big for bitcoin hype.
The more traction crypto gets across all platforms the quicker it becones mainstream. It's ok to enjoy hype news   every real step forward is exciting imo cellphones are all about cramming as many useful things into them as possible. If every cellphone catches on and they all begin including cryoto wallets as a standard feature people will take notice companies will take notice and easy payments via your phone will becone common place. It not going to be an adoption explosion but every fire begins with a spark.

100% legal. Another good one is buying property close to a college and renting the rooms out individually. A 4 bedroom single family home that was worth 1200 a month can now be rented out for 700 a bedroom utilities included. Even when you dont have all 4 rented you're still well over cost. Take the profits and up keep the house. 15-20 years later - Free house. 
Ive read a few books but im in college so Im not utilizing the knowledge yet but when I do I'll be paying to have the properties maintained and tennants dealt with.

Bitcoin is lurking in the shadows ready for the day governments fail to properly manage the money supply. 
I'm not an economist and the waters are a bit deep for me here but over time dont all governments face economic turbulence?  
Commentor said that other countries traditionally take refuse in the dollar in times of evonomic uncertainty so are we saying the U.S is the damn holding the flood gates back?
Its strange when you think about it but by owning btc you have a vested interest in the collapse of traditional finance and would directly benefit from a catastrophic event the likes of World War 3.
@_date: 2018-07-05 17:32:38
I see this being more like a war everday. A fight for independence where governments are held accountable for their actions. Citizens having control over the money supply displaces the threshold for corruption and redistributes power. We no longer need to fight for freedom with guns we are now able to use technology. So I guess you could say I think that's pretty cool.
@_date: 2018-07-19 20:44:26
Depends on what you do with it. 
If you buy and hold hoping to sell at a higher price later then bitcoin is definitely a better investment. 
If you plan to buy real estate and turn it into a business by renting it out then real estate is the better investment. 
Renting property allows you to cover mortgage, taxes and insurance and at the end of 15, 20 years you own the house free and clear. 
If you really want to make money in real estate convince people on the "rent to own idea" when someone rents to own you are no longer responsible for maintenence and can charge them taxes and insurance.  Also,  its been estimated that only 14% of people  who choose rent to own follow through so more often than not you get all the benefits of them paying higher rent + all maintenece and after a few years you get your house back. 
Hopefully youve chose a house in an area that blossoming so you are able to out perform inflation but in the end you should wind up with a property you've already rescouped your money on and can still sell for more than your original investment. 
Real estate is 100% the better option of you are qualified and willing to put in a little work. 
That being said I will continue to hold bitcoin until weve reached a 4T market cap or 400k per coin.

That's hard to do when you have 350k in bitcoin and make 30k a year. The feeling of risk and exposure gets pretty intense. Bird in the hand and whatnot. If it's life changing money average out half and hodl the rest is my suggestion.
Buy a house and reinvest what you'd be paying in rent. If it all goes tits up you still have a house.

802,521 BTC (worth $3,233,256,500),  It is currently possible for someone with access to $23 million USD to pump the price up by .5%  or $400
I’s not yet clear how Kobayashi will allocate the funds when the payouts to creditors eventually start.
My guess is it will be slowly distributed to those who are owed and then it's up to them to decide what to do.
Chances are most will hold and slowly sell small pieces over the next 10 years so they can maximize their return. Anyone selling all at once is either dumb or ready move on. The great thing is that in order to sell you need people willing to buy and there are Billions and Billions on the sidelines ready to gobble up cheap coins which would slow the bleed and eventually stomp it out all together. (my guess is around 2k if this unlikely scenario played out.)
Bottom line - Not much to worry about unless were at an ATH and you have life changing money on the line.

Store of value is higher on the list than medium of exchange but bitcoin's intrinsic value is being the most secure and decentralized network known to man. (Just ask Microsoft) 
Second on the list is that bitcoin is an econmic force to rival the NYSE. Think of alt coins as race cars you can bet on while bitcoin is the entire racetrack. You can own a piece of this racetrack which naturally acts a fund consisting of every alt/btc pair. Any given car may lose  but the racetrack is here to stay.
Lastly I would say that bitcoin works better than gold as it eaily transfers large sums of wealth without borders or the obstacles of physically moving chunks of precious metal.
As a Daily use currency it's to slow and fees are to high. For now at least

I  strongly believe that bitcoin is a far superior store of value compared to anything currently available however I doubt it will ever function well as a currency. I'm aware of lightning networks potential but when the dust settles I believe bitcoin will only be used as digital gold for store of value and large purchases.
I believe another digital currency will emerge as the best option for the daily exchange of goods and services.
Bitcoins blockchain network is slow and expensive which makes it the most reliable and trustworthy but as of now it doesn't reasonably function as a currency for day to day purchases like gas and groceries.
Maybe some second layer solution (Like Lightning) will eventually make it a reasonable choice but I foresee a future where were using another coin for typical payments. I'm hoping that currency will be litecoin but even then it's only 4x faster. Hell maybe we'll have three; Gold, Silver and Copper, But I doubt it.
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:21:27
Odds are infinitely greater that it will exceed 20k. Bitcoin is big business and there's billions to be made through facilitation.

Ive borrowed and invested about 15k which is interest free until I graduate next year so fingers crossed. If btc hits 14k by then I will have paid off the loan leaving me a "free" 15k in the market.

I think the immaturity, memes and cool factor of bitcoin is good for adoption. My little brother is 16 and half of his friends have crypto and price watch. Two years ago he asked me to buy him some and transfer to his wallet. My point is that the children of today are the future of tomorrow and making bitcoin cool is good.
