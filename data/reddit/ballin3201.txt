I already added my debit card and i can add funds with no id or anything. The only issue is the limit per week.

Yeah so i buy the btc on the second account then  just enter the email of my main account and it will send instantly?

Yeah the two account think seems like it will work. So could i buy the btc on the second account and send it to my main circle account somehow?
@_date: 2015-12-05 23:33:06
Ok ill try that. Also if the id i send a pic of is a parents or something but the account is still mine, is that ok?

Hmm I just tried uphold and its asking me for id verification to add a debit and I cant really do that right now so I dont think that would work. Thanks for the help though!

For id verification is there a min age to do it? Im only 16 so I could use my passport but is that age ok or do I have to be 18?

No i deposited usd from a debit card just to add funds. No btc involved

Yeah circle seems the best optioin its just that there is a 300 weekly limit. Is there anyway to get around that today?
@_date: 2015-11-24 20:09:51
Yea ill do that. Anyways just buying some skins for a video game nothing illegal.

Thanks so much for the bits. So I just got circle and made an account. I only have a debit card so is there anyway I could enter an amount in USD to convert to btc? Or do I just have to buy the btc outright? Thanks for all the help.
