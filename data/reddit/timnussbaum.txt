That sounds a little risky from a hardware aspect since the hardware could fail. Be sure you have recorded the seed phrase and stored it securely. I recently got this and it works great for [cold storage]( as there isn't anything to fail

Good point about long-term storage of keys and hardware failure - I don't see this mentioned often enough. I recently got this kit that avoids hardware failure and provides for multiple copies of the seed mnemonic to be stored

While you wait for your hardware wallet if you're not comfortable storing on Coinbase, you should generate an offline wallet, but for that to be most secure, it would require a completely offline computer that's separate from your everyday use computer. If you generate a BIP39 seed you can recover that onto your hardware wallet when it arrives. Note that Electrum doesn’t generate BIP39 compatible seeds. 
Also to protect your written seed from loss to fire you could use something like this
