For those unaware, these are Casascius coins. His (Mike) first brass physical bitcoin dates from 2011.

Are you begging for money in real life too?
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:18:27
How cute.
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:32:43


Are you talking about BlockStream?
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:41:58


That is not how a market cap works, there was way less than 40 billion USD inflow.
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:00:08
It won't even take 10 minutes to confirm.
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:39:32
Ublock or Ublock Origin? Sauce?
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:58:16
So it actually reduced a lot.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:24:52
Phew, happy this time is different. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:19:25
It is not required because Monero has an opaque blockchain. You can't see the balance or transactions (source/destination/amount) on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:51:14


You make the same mistake again.
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:43:03
It is Voorhees.

Segwit2x will likely have the majority of hashrate, all the miners (93%) are signaling for it. This is a completely different situation than with the Bitcoin Cash fork.

Think you missed an important addition to indeed a great point. You can have an Android phone for 25$ and an unlimited data connection for a dollar per month in India.
Of course in 2008 there were alternatives for a store of value as well. Gold, guns, paintings, what not. But now it is just a press of a button on your smart phone instead of having to go through all kinds of hoops.
Bitcoin is way more liquid as well.
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:09:56
Congrats. Now please make sure to get it of the exchange into your (paper) wallet (if you don't own the private key you don't own the bitcoin).
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:44:03
Actually 1/2 since it were two pizzas.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:40:57
A pattern reoccurs till it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:03:25
No, since you are not actually owning the bitcoin, you just have some digits displayed in their internal database.
You need to own the private key of the bitcoin to actually have ownership.
Create a paper wallet, get a hardware wallet or use the Breadwallet app.

It is not about ShapeShift but about Core 0.15
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:06:35
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:37:45
Get used to it.
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:25:10
Yes, getting only one of the two coins.
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:31:55
That is not true:
1. Before the fork: send all your coins to a single **new address** you control
2. After the fork: send (burn) at least 546 satoshi to the blacklisted ("3Bit") address; wallet automatically sends the rest to a **change address**
That's it. All your coins are now replay-protected. Segwit2x BTC is in **new address**, and Core BTC is in **change address**.

Yes: there is money to be made.

It hurts my OCD that when you transfer the bitcoin into your own wallet, you won't have a whole bitcoin anymore because of the transaction fee. 
So now you have to buy more, and so it begins..
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:07:18
No, that what not the point.
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:17:48
No they don't. Look at Bitpay, many of the coins spent at Bitpay are sold OTC. Those bitcoins end up in strong hands.

A bitcoin is basically an entry in a distributed database. To be able to move that entry to a new address, it requires you to sign the transaction with the private key to proof you own that bitcoin.
Companies like Coinbase hold these private keys for you. So you don't actually control the bitcoin. Bitcoin is about being your own bank, no fear that companies go bankrupt. But that comes with greater responsibility as well:
- You can create *and print* a paper wallet using  You then own the private key yourself.
Play with it to get a feel for it. Once you are ready to move the funds to your paper wallet, please make sure you generate the address on an offline computer, preferably one that is and never will be connected to the internet. Or use a bootable Ubuntu USB stick. Make multiple distributed copies in case of fire or water!
- A hardware wallet is more secure since you don't run the risk of having an infected computer while creating the paper wallet or making a transaction. You can order one from  or 
*Make sure to write down the seed on a piece of paper and store it securely in at least two different physical locations in case of fire. The seed can re-generate the private keys even when your hardware wallet breaks down or gets lost.*
- The free app Breadwallet is considered to be safe as well, but I still would not recommend it for larger amounts. *Make sure to write down the seed on a piece of paper and store it securely in at least two different physical locations in case of fire. The seed can re-generate the private keys even when you lose your phone.*

That is not how it works.
@_date: 2017-10-10 05:48:48
Indeed, usually you leave the bank empty handed and shot.
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:23:22




Or just don't use a currency with a transparent blockchain for these kind of use cases. Bitcoin is not fungible, [learn about it](
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:50:49
No, in such a case your wallet knows that the address is incorrect:

Run Safari in desktop mode ('Request Desktop Site' button).
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:52:50
Just to consolidate your coins in case you have many addresses. You leak privacy this way, but then you only have to do step 2 once.
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:26:04
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:50:03
You don't have to buy a whole one. Like you don't have to buy a whole kilo of gold, but for example an ounce or a coin.
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:35:21
What if Bitcoin's price is actually skyrocketing because of the 90% miner support / likelihood of getting 2MB blocks?
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:08:13
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:44:39


@_date: 2017-10-06 06:32:13


Isn't this currently quite a privacy leak? You can determine the actual amount sent since you know which amount goes to the change address?

How much does a bitcoin weigh?
