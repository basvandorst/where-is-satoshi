Thank you for bringing this up.
I thought about joining but I think I will go with mtgoxrecovery.com instead, if anything.
The 2 BTC is too much at this stage. I would have considered if the retainer fee had been lower, e.g. 0.25 BTC now and a success fee of 20% of recovered coins.

Agree. Please use paragraphs. Cannot read

If I get more back with your initiative and the lawyers compared to if I file claim myself, then 10 % is fine. Even 20 % is OK if for some reason your lawyers manage to get more back!

You are right there. It is not the whole story most likely.
@_date: 2014-03-10 09:26:45
Matches exactly.
@_date: 2014-03-19 10:11:57
I am concerned it will be valued as 1 BTC = 0.
@_date: 2014-03-15 07:54:45
Have not tried but looks cool. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:56:11
Any update now then?

Would be nice to hear from Bitmain Tech Ltd. But maybe they are too busy making chips, coins and cash?
Also the companies setting up BTC ATMs in Singapore, HK, Korea, etc. What are their views on how to grow the network and serve as an fiat/cash connection points? What are their experiences on compliance with existing laws and regulations? And interaction with the existing banking system in each respective country?
For a Thai perspective it would be nice to hear from Bitcoin.co.th. The Central Bank of Thailand shut them down last year, and they turned to mining instead. But then the Central Bank of Thailand officially said that the BTC trade doesn't come under the bank's jurisdiction, as long as the trade is only BTC&lt;-&gt;THB and no foreign currency is involved - so now they are back in business again.
Would also be good to hear someone talk about solar-powered mining - for sure someone should be exploring that somewhere around Singapore/ASEAN?

Thank you for translation. Who needs fiction when there is MtGox and reddit.

Thanks for listing actual relevant questions!
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:20:51
Thanks. Sent an email to Selachii - let's see what/if they answer.
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:47:19
Automated. I received the exact same reply.
With no answer to my question on how their fee structure works...
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:41:25
The best part:
" Therefore , I am sorry , but to return the deposit and bit coin in Can not "
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:51:21
Selachii has said that you can pay with cash also.

Ok, Gox can pay its taxes, rent, employee salaries and utility costs/office running costs. But no other debts now.
Also CEO salary...?
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:01:12
So what are they saying? I don't have Bloomberg in the jungle.
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:17:12
Is anyone here joining this?
Can there be a potential downside or are there only potential upsides?
If Gox still has control of cold store wallets and wants to repay BTC in BTC, can it be negative in some way to have been part of this Class Action?
Background: I would like to get some BTC back. Have no fiat claims.

The new mystery of MTGOX bankruptcy
Who pulled out 530,000 BTC from March 7 through 10th ?
Having become insolvent, MTGOX (Shibuya, Tokyo), which operated an exchange for the virtual currency bitcoin, filed with the Tokyo District Court on February 28 for civil rehabilitation proceedings.
No decision regarding the initiation of civil rehabilitation proceedings has been forthcoming from the Tokyo District Court during the three weeks since then. Such decisions regarding initiation are generally forthcoming within one to two weeks, but no decision has been issued yet, and so MTGOX has not even been able to approach the starting line for rehabilitation.
The new mystery
Amid these circumstances, some new facts have come to light through news reporting. These include the fact that a creditor’s representative filed a petition with the Tokyo District Court dated March 11, noting inexplicable post-insolvency developments at MTGOX. Appended to the petition were materials from the website COINSIGHT showing a bitcoin transaction history in which evidence was presented indicating transactions of at least 530,000 bitcoins at MTGOX from March 7 through 10.
The text includes this passage: “Requests regarding massive bitcoin withdrawals were made which should have been impossible for anyone other than those with special bitcoin exchange access rights, such as representatives (i.e., Mark Karpeles) of the rehabilitation debtor (MTGOX).” The amounts of these withdrawals are shown in the table in the reference materials below.
Appended to the petition were materials from the website COINSIGHT showing a bitcoin transaction history in which evidence was presented indicating transactions of at least 530,000 bitcoins at MTGOX from March 7 through 10.
Regarding the approximate total of 850,000 bitcoins owned by the company and its clients, it was explained by MTGOX in a February 28 press conference on the bankruptcy that, “Virtually all of it is gone.” The petition asks emphatically, “How is it possible to perform transactions with something that is supposed to have disappeared?” If there were transactions during early March, then the explanation by MTGOX of “bitcoin loss” is not factual. On March 20, in fact, MTGOX issued a news release stating that, “On March 7, the presence of 200,000 bitcoins was confirmed.”
When a request for an opinion on the petition was made of Nobuaki Kobayashi, an attorney serving on the oversight committee for the MTGOX civil rehabilitation case, the only reply received came from his secretary: “No response can be given to questions regarding this case.” What could be the aims of MTGOX, which shut its doors with baffling abruptness just two days after announcing on February 26 that all transactions were being halted? The mystery remains entirely unresolved.
