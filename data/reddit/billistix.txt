Pfffft, I'd trust 4chan over Ichan.
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:53:34
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:42:31
Yeah except the bitcoin community sits around and basically says we need to trust each other to make this work.

From wikipedia:
Between about 1998 and 2005 Szabo developed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency that he called "bit gold", which some have called a 'direct precursor to the Bitcoin architecture'.
Sure he couldn't have just got together with some programmer and then called the team satoshi nakamoto?

No love for my video?

Well now you know and knowings half the battle.

That shit drove the price down every time I swear to god.

So? How can you tell their IP addresses aren't government owned? You think because they point to a company called Business Logistics International they're not the Feds?

The war on shit posts.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:08:30
This community has a problem. One side it's all "we're a community!" The other side is "fuck you, security is your concern, if you traded in gox or put your Bitcoin's on a bit-card then fuck you, should've known better"
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:38:30
Ok, but what about my redo of "Big In Japan" to "Still In Japan"? 
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:51:46
They should also marry mac os and linux and go open source, they'd win.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:44:45
You guys are fucking stupid, give your money to someone who needs a hand. If this guy's life was so upset by Newsweek then he can go sue then.
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:01:09
Yeah but his brother says he's an asshole and he fished for a free lunch. I wonder if his story might just be a cash grab.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:45:56
Upon reading it over you have convinced me to buy a bunch of Dogecoin because it's serious shit.
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:29:51
That'd be the conspiracy.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:44:11
I feel like it makes it more boutique. Their current nEo thing is kinda ugly and everything I see calls them Neo &amp; Bee not just neo so you might as well brand as such.

A quote like that from a guy who's running a big Bitcoin operation? No!
Remember when r/bitcoin had real news?
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:41:06
Yeah but they're strutting around here acting like they're legit and not going to gox anyone, meanwhile they won't say they've deleted their keys?

I thought it already made it?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:41:44
Oh fuck, well that makes Bitcoin sound like some stupid nerd pussy shit that I could never take seriously.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:41:21
Uh, no I want to buy more.
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:17:05
Just get a bunch of clips of major bitcoin guys on the scene. For the audio dub use Steve Jobs' read that apple decided not to use when they did the campaign back in the day.

Ha! Big mistake!

Someone who wanted to support an artist they love? By your logic I'm dumb for using any site.

Go to where there are swords. You'll find him there.
@_date: 2014-03-08 19:06:38
Ha, there's no jobs for these people! They're going to be up to their eyeballs in debt with no way to relieve it. You think they're going to like banks still? The ones that foreclosed on their mom's house? Nah.
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:49:59
ha, umad.
@_date: 2014-02-23 05:48:42
For the less talented:
or you can go around the comment areas around here and wait for someone to say something like "send them a bitcoin tip on reddit" and then you play dumb and go "You can get Bitcoin through Reddit?" and someone goes "yeah" and you reply "sure, sure." and hopefully a high rolling bitcoin zealot will see your reply and send you 5 or 6 mbtc to show you it's true and the versatility of Bitcoin.
I've made 1 whole bitcoin doing a job on jobs4bitcoins and around .0390894 in the "act dumb" scam and through other tips on reddit for saying awesome stuff.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:51:52

Ugh, 3 properties? You're rich dude.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:29:12
And you've forgotten all the keys you gave out and burned them in a fire?
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:00:43
Yeah, he's dead.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:15:04
Well the dollar is going to crash soon so I'm sure those bill companies would be begging for bitcoin at that point.
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:38:16
Man, talk about bringing the value down.
@_date: 2014-02-09 19:01:07
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:22:39
Dude, Nick Szabo created Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:48:49
I might believe the story if you made it rain on me a little.....
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:09:31
Oh you're the best captain hindsight. I'm sure every investment you've made came out awesome.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:59:14
Because you have to pay interest on stuff you buy with credit cards.
With credit cards you always have to make an account and yadda yadda yadda. Bitcoin doesn't need any info to give or someone to send and receive bitcoin.

How do we know you're not spreading disinformation to keep the honeypot going?
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:30:13
It's kept you out.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:36:22
And yet bit card may not have deleted pass codes to cards they sold.
@_date: 2014-02-17 17:36:34
Thanks for making reddit suck.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:24:44
Well that's what I meant.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:53:38
They hope.
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:38:25
Because you backtraced them?

Weren't you expecting just a little bit more?
Ok here's another one:

Holy fuck, misogynistic? The shit is open source!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:06:19
Do you need a bank account to do that?
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:14:06
I hope Apple starts sliding so bad they beg Woz to come in and run the show.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:56:34
Well I think more may have them just not at the level of 10 whole coins.
There's probably lots of reddit users who have been tipped 25 cents in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:28:03
Sigh, it's just not the same.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:33:44


Yeah and how come he's no big shot I ever heard of?


The warning is fine but warning someone about investing is stupid in itself. Investing in anything is a gamble. If someone invested in Apple right before it hit the shitter there were loads of people saying "I TOLD YA SO" but they all fucked right off when Apple bounced back.
It wasn't the fact that the father warned him. This is fine in itself, any respectable father would say "Son, don't bet your shirt, just invest what you can afford to say goodbye to"
It's because the father gloated about it. Like a little child. This is not a father figure. At best his father has put himself in the position of "frenemy"


If this text has more texts like it or phone calls or bad Christmases and thanksgivings then yeah, maybe the kid should move on. This has nothing to do Bitcoin so don't try to twist this to fit some bullshit narrative in your head.
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:33:14
Seems like bitcoins aren't safe on anything.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:36:25
Hmmm... *turns on BitMinter*

I'm downvoting this just because of your title. Fuck you and your teasing.
@_date: 2014-03-05 04:29:04
Yeah but they seem to be talking about the new cards
@_date: 2014-02-20 01:38:05
It'd be funnier if the po's were poo's.
@_date: 2014-02-23 18:30:16
So basically any future warning is pointless to listen to?
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:47:26
Afterwards did you guys get drunk and fuck whores?
@_date: 2014-01-30 19:56:45
Incorporated doesn't exactly mean mac os is totally open source.
@_date: 2014-02-23 00:01:25

Whoops actually she's Kenyan, the future of bitcoin is in Africa
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:57:06
I don't understand why people are on to who Satoshi is, I though everyone agreed its nick szabo
@_date: 2014-02-05 19:14:32
Well they've been saying for a while that there's going to be a crash or at least a correction. You've seen that graphic being passed around of the chart of the depression matching to our current trajectory.
Recently the Dow dipped a little and apparently a jobs report is coming out Friday and I bet it won't be good news, which might be the pin that pops the federal reserve bubble.
Oh and the Sochi winter Olympics starts on Friday. Guess who's going to have some big distraction?
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:19:08
Oh my god I wish I bought a whole bunch of bitcoin when it was 30 cents a coin. That's my dream car. So is the Delorean.
I'm hoping one day 1 bitcoin will be enough to buy a Delorean from someone one day.

Yeah Linus would've said "we're not your fucking software vendor"
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:22:52
What if the stock market effects the dollar which then effects the price of bitcoin?

Is my gen 1 card still safe?
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:22:53
Well it did already pretty much die already, Steve was a long time ago now. Another 5 years without him and they'll be back to infomercials at 3am trying to sell Performas.
If they were smart they'd beg BEG for Wozniak to come in and just obliterate the place but they're waaaay to greedy to let that happen.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:12:01
Yeah but I doubt it'll go much lower than 400.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:19:37
Watching girls go to the bathroom eh? Creeper.
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:05:36
Mine was truer to the original apple ad!
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:32:22
Yeah, I thought 10k per coin sounded high.
Then I read those stats saying if you have 10 bitcoins you're in the top 5% of people who have bitcoin now.
So basically barely anyone still has bitcoins. When everyone has them what's going to happen?
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:25:50
Why would your dad wish bad on you like that? Maybe you should get him out of your life, he's bad karma.

Yeah the new ones, what about the old ones?

So did munze buy the teacher's pussy? Like what's the point?

It's not that, it's your title. It's bait, it's a tease, it says nothing of what to expect when I click it.
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:46:12
What about the citadels?

@_date: 2014-02-17 10:56:19
You're probably looking at gox's price at 300. Everyone else is at 600.
Reason being is gox dying.

Yeah, NSA runs all the TOR nodes. However it should be noted the use or TOR in season 2 isn't helping the guy...

Also, here's Mark's theme:
- Shibuya's cityside
- Crypto-bits of currancy
- All around my head and on my phone
- I had no illusions
- That I'd ever find a glimpse
- Of Madoff's heatwaves in your eyes
- You did what you did to me
- Now it's history I see
- Here's my comeback on silk road again
- Things will happen while they can
- I will wait here for Mt.Gox tonight
- It's easy when you're still in Japan
- Aah when you're still in Japan-tonight...
- Still in Japan-be-tight...
- Still in Japan... ooh the Bitcoins are so cool
- Still in Japan-alright,
- Pay! -- Then I'll skip town some way
- Things are easy when you're still in Japan
- Oh when you're still in Japan
- Bankruptcy laws are a sin , passing protesters
- Driking iced coffees you know they paid for
- Spent your bitcoins at the zoo
- Or should I go and change condo's view
- For other beach scenes
- You did what you did to me
- Now it's history I see
- Things will happen while they can
-  I will wait here for Mt. Gox tonight
- It's easy when you're still in Japan
- Aah when you're still in Japan-tonight...
