I have a few different wallets, but coinbase.com is where I buy all of my bitcoin. You would need to set up and account, link the way you wish to pay (creditcard/bank account) and then you should be good to go. I have also heard good things about circle.com, but I don't have a wallet there myself.

I would suggest not using paypal. I have had a very easy time buying bitcoin using coinbase.

I got it working on explorer but by main browser is chrome. I am still unable to pull it up on chrome. Any possible explanation?

that's the plan, first I need to be able to accept payment everynight though. Right now I can only accept payments when I am present. Should be ready by this weekend and you'll see us on coinmap soon.

Why does cryptowat display volume for coinbase? I thought they didn't because they are a private organization.
