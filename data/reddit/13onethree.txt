Glad to help. That is one feature I like about Trezor I think other wallets could implement too. Usually the password is not required to generate a wallet from the backup seed. I still suggest building a machine like you plan for other offline wallets and paper wallet creation.

I don't know much about building a laptop and don't know where a good tutorial would be off hand so I'm no help there.

Also turn it off in bios just for good measure. Obviously build your own if you can.

So Satoshis coins OR the network somehow becomes compromised...Obviously I don't think this is going to happen, but unpredictable shit happens all the time. I'm not even an alt coin troll, it just seems pretty ignorant to think that there won't be a second, that everyone is just going to automatically trade every other crypto assets they have at some arbitrary point in time just because it now looks like bitcoin will "make it". Again I'm just being real. Your last sentence also is questionable. The fact you think it ought to be okay for one man to become a *trillionaire (long term) just because they created something is a bit ignorant as well as scary. I'd honestly feel better with the central banks remaining in power.

Basically just means importing the funds to a different wallet/address. So the person you give the paper wallet to would need to scan the private key with their phone or something right away and import it into their own wallet (while sweeping the keys to a new address so it uses a different key). This ensures that you don't just go home, and take the funds using a backup of the key you just gave away.

Obviously not the case, but for comparison, if bitcoin was a company and blockchain was a trademarked term, then blockchain.info would be a form of cybersquatting which is illegal. I don't really care about the past or whatever they pioneered, I care about their ethics in practice today, and I do not agree with them. They are 100% aware of the extreme confusion they cause many people, especially noobs.

Blockchain isn't a wallet. It's a public ledger of bitcoin transactions.

There's too much invested in ltc for it to just continue to die. It will turn when bitcoin does, whales will have their fun, and when new users enter the market litecoin will appeal to them as a "cheaper" option for a coin. No, I don't have any proof or even know for sure if I will make btc, but I'm extremely optimistic for a coin like ltc. In b4 alts are dead etc etc. Cool story.
