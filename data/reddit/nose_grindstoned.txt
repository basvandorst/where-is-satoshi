This is the only way to do it.   Buy routinely.  The same amount, at regular intervals, and pay little attention to the current value.  When it's high, ya bought some that week, when it's low, ya bought some that week.
If you enjoy the thrill of paying attention to it all daily, then put stop-losses on all your coins, and watch each day.

I didn't read other comments,  just OP....
The IRS wants a list of large buyers.  They're looking into how buyers obtained their money....  They're not looking into how much you might owe in taxes if you were to cash out of bitcoin.

Excellent!  Thanks, just what I was looking for.

I do this all the time (usually with customer service reps on the phone).... If a company has wronged me, and I explain the situation to the customer service rep, at some point I try to get the rep to admit the company is in the wrong by personally agreeing with me.

If you were to cash out $5000 worth of bitcoin and deposit it into your bank account, no red flags would be raised.  I'm not positive, but I believe $10K is when the bank needs to notify the government.
You are legally required to report the earnings as income.   You're supposed to pay taxes on the profits (not the whole thing)
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:18:48
it's $10K when someone pays $10K to 1.
@_date: 2017-04-23 09:59:22
It's a paradox.  Once there's an invention to find lost bitcoin, bitcoin ceases to be what it's supposed to be.    I think lost bitcoins are forever lost.
Perhaps there may be some retrievable bitcoins out there, and certain savvy treasure hunters will know what to look for?

Coinbase isn't an option cause they're screwed up right now.
Kraken isn't working right now.
Bitstamp has taken over a week for validation.
I've been bitching and ranting about it for a week now.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:50:43
Just a small run and cash out.   All of the coinz the past week especially rose up huge.  Someone holding a lot cashed out, then others followed to cash out some winnings.  Everything seems to be regrouping for the continued rise again.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:11:20
Paypal is fairly instant.. but, yeah, I get your point.
Still, a bank account all happens immediately after you walk in and set up the account.   Getting the ATM card takes days, true.  And getting a credit card would take days too.
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:04:32
No one knows where the value of bitcoin will go... so people accepting bitcoin as a form of payment and those paying for things with bitcoin both are in agreement that at the time of purchase, bitcoin is worth what it is worth.  In hindsight, it's easy to see the value change, but at the time of the purchase, it's worth what it's worth.
Bitcoin being so volatile isn't great... it makes people have to change their set prices for things....   But the fact that bitcoin value is rising doesn't make it bad.  People currently want bitcoin, and are willing to pay what the price currently is.

I'd buy one bitcoin at $2300 right now if there was a way to.  Unfortunately coinbase is sucking right now.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:00:40
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:04:45
Is it a USA thing?
Coinbase was the one that I was already verified for, so I don't remember what I had to do to be able to buy/sell bitcoin on their site however I'm almost positive I had to submit an image of my license. 
I do know coinbase isn't taking new credit cards right now. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:01:24
me too!  I'm right in the same boat... and have done a few days of research to find nothing much.   Bitstamp and Kraken are the other two that stood out as competitive with coinbase.
I think coinmama is about the worst
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:01:55
and Kraken, Bitstamp, all of em.
Coinmama is the only one where it looks like you can buy up to $150 without a full verified account... but they charge an arm and a leg.

I'm on the same boat with exactly what you said. He's a smart cookie, but cant separate the tech from his perception of the value in relation to fiat.   I personally think bitcoin is waaaay undervalue right now (I think it should be around $5500)... but hey, that's just me.

I think Etherium is the cryptocoin that solves most of Bitcoin's problems.   
This is nothing more than a guess, but I think if there's an exodus from bitcoin, a majority will switch to Etherium.
bitcoin might be myspace, and etherium could be facebook... all just a hunch

Coinbase takes credit cards.
Kracken is probably the best for you in UK if not coinbase.
There are none that are hassle free, however coinmama allows up to $150 transactions with the least amount of wait.

I'm in with this.    I think both bitcoin and etherium are going to pop.  I like the dopamine that comes with the jumps.  I don't like missing out on the pops.    I'm not concerned at all that Eth or bitcoin will crash.  They'll be volatile,  sure... but that's fun
@_date: 2017-06-24 12:42:44
If EVERYONE collectively together concentrates (while buying some bitcoin) it'll move up
