I bet that was his method of saying "shooo, go away".

I think what O.P. is trying to say is at what point would you sell your coins, not how much they are actually worth. O.P. thinks his coins are worth $300, so he will sell them whenever(if ever) the market reaches $300.

The price increase to $1,200 was a result of pumping. It wasn't some random event where bitcoin just went up 100 times its orginal value for no reason. Do you see anyone pumping and dumbing in the future?

Advertising by giving out .01¢ tip? You have to admit that those people are assholes(the one cent tippers).

Of course they don't. Why would they? They accept payments from BitPay who pays Amazon in a usable currency(i.e. U.S. dollar).

Oh my lord... Do you even know what debt is? Bitcoin has no debt because bitcoin is a currency(or at least people claim it is) you incredibly retarded moron. Bitcoin is not a government institution or a company or even a private individual. The U.S. dollar doesn't have debt either and neither does the Euro, Pound Sterling, Mexican Peso... These currenciea are, however, used as debt instruments. Jeez, at least learn something about bitcoin if you are going to bend backwards for it.

I'm sure this is like 50 Redditors from Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and Austria combined.

According to what? There is absolutely no stats that support a 1 million user figure. Most stats are less generous and give a 200-300K estimate.

I'm guessing you were left with nothing reasonable to say, so you instead option for the retarded, against all the facts claim.
Good job representing Bitcoin! *hugs*

Of course I am. And to be honest, I don't see why they would be afraid They could destroy your currency in days if they wanted to. These bankers and their banks are trillions of dollars deep, bitcoin is just a tiny $3.2 billion currency that is not on the radar of 99+%of the world's population.

Not to mention the fact that soliciting sexual acts from non-adults is something that is frowned upon in every developed nation on this Earth. The age of consent in Spain is 13... Now, go ahead and attempt having sex or soliciting sex from a 13 year old. You're not going to end up well.

Being a troll doesn't make a comment any less true you moron. He could be a space alien for all I care. His point still stands.

Idiots? Why? No one uses bitcoin to pay with anything. It's a miracle Amazon hasn't dropped bitpay. People purchased ~$800 billion worth of things, and bitcoin only accounted for ~$600 million worth of that. 
Edit: a word.
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:38:28
And since $800 is a pipe dream, what exactly are you going to do? At what price would you sell?
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:49:32


According to what? I could just as easily claim that the bitcoin userbase has fallen.
