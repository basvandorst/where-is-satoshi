Fair enough, but even then I hope you mentioned that it's a decentralized system and the most free market that we have known since the dawn of mankind. This of course means that the price might do whatever it wants.

"Execute faster" is only good if you're doing 1 or 2 startups at once max. 
Also, taking notes as a precautionary tactic in case other parties might steal the idea is probably fine in a country which has good judicial foundations. In most of the world however that is still a huge challenge.

It has been [shown]( that Bitcoin price reacts to news. Considering he has quite a bit of followers on Twitter, it isn't strange to think that he has at least some influence.
Also, a pump doesn't necessarily have to be all the way to $1200.

I don't think I've seen a lot of unhappy merchants on Takeaway complaining that it was more of a hassle now that Takeaway started accepting BTC, nor of the fact that they were potentially making more money.
But at the end of the day I guess I just want the merchants to shut up and take my money.

The comment you replied to was the following:
[–]blAkFlaK4 1 point 18 hours ago 
DigitalTangibleTrust is trading gold bars on the blockchain. hard to imagine, but their gold doesn't trade at the same price as BTC. anyone could right now issue a billion dollars in gold on top of bitcoin
BTC could drop to $0 and the gold would still be there, at its own price. the gold may drop in value if there's a major flaw in bitcoin's cryptography that screws up the asset ledger, but otherwise it works the same even if Bitcoin's price is $0. and when you consider that it costs BTC fees to trade DigitalTangible's gold on the blockchain, you start to realize that's a clear form of sustainable demand for BTC.
The comment replied **to** you was the following:
[–]blAkFlaK4 1 point 18 hours ago 
i don't think bitcoin goes to zero in any scenario, especially if more and more people start trading gold on the bitcoin blockchain, which requires BTC fees. it gives people a non-negotiable reason to own some bitcoin. this solidifies the value proposition of the network, whereas today the only thing keeping the price up is VC buzz, libertarian appeals, economic collapse heresay, and get rich quick pumpers; the only people buying bitcoin for commerce are people wanting to buy drugs

What kind of incompassionate dick would someone have to be to blame the uninformed victims (which really isn't a rarity nor will it be for the foreseeable future) for their losses? It speaks for itself that you don't go out to a street and cuss everyone out right? I imagine people have enough morals to realize that. Yet, despite knowing this they still choose to let their anger out on some new Bitcoiner who just bought their first coins without doing proper research (again, which is pretty easy to do).

Hah, I'm curious. In the ever-developing Bitcoin economy, can't consumers more easier than ever become producers, thus businesses of their own?

Yes. Friedcat learned his lesson and was quoted saying something like "This company is aiming to squeeze many of the competition into the negative profit territory".
It's clear that he has blood in his eyes and gen4 is on the horizon. My bets are that AM is heading to become a monster it once was.

He gave you an incorrect link. That link is meant for discussions about the Bitcoin price. On there is less traction but that subreddit is meant exactly what it sounds like.
Be wary though. Bitcoin securities tend to be more volatile and ridden with scammers. Neo&amp;Bee is just one of many examples in this. There are some legit looking operations, but even here there is risk to be accounted for.

Ho there, let's not get all tinfoil in here.
Most probable explanation is that they are just trolls trying to sway the public opinion to either push the price down or smear that product to offer their own.
I myself am almost on the edge of abandoning this community because I think rather than focusing on world-changing technology, people here just focus on the price... which is the most uninteresting aspect of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-09-05 17:59:30
I myself am a bit hesitant to donate. When Bitcoin is considered money, it would mean that everyone dealing with buying and selling BTC will have to get some sort of license. Suddenly you have boatloads of new entrants to this market denied the right to participate, which goes against the notions of a free and competitive market.
I think Bitcoin shouldn't be either be seen as money or a product, it's a whole new phenomenon in and of itself. You can't just push it into a box like that. I think new propositions should be written which place cryptocurrencies into a new category. The difference of course being that this proposal should be written **in a way that allows anyone to participate in this process**.

You know, I'm 32. I started learning Linux and open source 2 years ago. It's so confusing for me at this age that I've even had dreams in which I saw my dad as an engineer who taught me programming when I was a little kid. But that all didn't happen, instead I don't know my dad and no one taught me a single fucking thing about technology. I had to learn it all on my own, and I'm still learning.
Yeah you know... sometimes when parents push for something it's a good thing that can only benefit the kid in later life. Don't be a judgmental asshole and think about different scenarios for once.

Wow thanks, I'll try this out for sure when I'll get familiar with programming.
Meanwhile the thing I wanted to know is scrypt-kdf. This way I can create long passwords out of relatively simple strings. Although, it's a bit of shame that scrypt-kdf isn't available on Linux installations per default (while things like sha256sum and sha512sum are). Creating passwords on offline distro's this way becomes more problematic (unless of course I make my own distro and include scrypt-kdf myself).

You said that in the US, the people were much more welcoming the Internet. Which I think is logical since there are more tech-inclined people surrounding the ones who go for the latest tech *and* the US people tend to go for the early tech earlier than most countries.

So does this mean that the sum of 0.999999 BTC will be paid but the 0.000001 BTC won't get back to you because it's considered dust by miners? Or is it that if one of the outputs is considered dust that the whole transaction can't go through?

I know, and the subsequent loss of customer/merchant BTC was also not as bad if you take into consideration that most of those funds have been paid back (months later). What I'm saying though is that darknet transactions are a big deal in the Bitcoin space, but they're definitely not the biggest anymore since more and more 'clearnet' merchants accept BTC day by day and offer discounts.

This is a free market, so you can set your daily pay expectations to whatever you want. We would generally initially recommend to set it to $5/day, but you have to see what the competition charges and set it accordingly later. For your region it may be more than that, but it may also be less.

It makes sense when you start frequenting Facebook again.
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:52:09
I first heard of BTC in 2011. The Gawker article. I dismissed it at first thinking it was some kind of a scam, especially after the first Goxing. I thought it was done for. Then in 2012 I realized that albeit the price fall, the protocol was steady as a rock. I began telling everyone about this phenomenon but had no serious money to invest in (also, there wasn't any legitimate possibility to buy coins in NL).
Then, finally I had a paying job in 2013 and figured I could score some cheap coins... except that's when the April rush started to happen. I finally had my paycheck so that I could buy coins... at $250.
After a while, I collected over 20 coins, which I subdivided among ASICMINER, ActiveMining and LabCoin. 2 of the 3 ventures turned out to be complete and utter failures. AM is nowhere what it once was. So now I'm here, down and out of coins or cash while *I know* that the value will go up!
Do you have any idea how that feels? It's insanity. I wake up every day thinking about this, of the metaphorical train leaving the station while I could  have just as well been on it, in the deluxe coupe.
I could have chosen to scam or steal coins from people, because believe me, I know how to hide my tracks. Instead, I went for honesty. Because I know that honesty gets rewarded in the long run. Instead, I get laughed at and no one seems to take me seriously. Is this it? Is this the Bitcoin community I've came to love?
It's maddening to even think about. I saw all of this potential, but now it's fading away from me, every uptick, every second, every day. I am running out of options and this is one of the final options I am willing to explore. If this runs out, then who knows what else there will be for me?

Not sure, since lots of online stores add discounts when customers use BTC. That's actually a very real thing since BTC actually saves the merchants some hefty amounts of fees which would otherwise be eaten by credit card fees. For example, BTC is the cheapest form of payment on  - the Dutch takeway.com online shop.

Absolutely, an open source TSM like Trezor is the way to go regardless of the OS, but still that requires to have one.
And yes, any OS can be susceptible of malware infection if the user runs code from untrusted sources, but that's why rudimentary things like the official repos make it inherently difficult to install malware. Still possible, but difficult.
Furthermore the open source design of Linux can make it so it can be molded to anything the user requires. That means that varying security models can be adjusted to your liking, even to the point of having security while having convenience. Things like QubesOS and their isolationist security model are therefor much more attainable on a platform which is open.

No no no. I understand your stance and you trying to change the system from a judicial view, but you have to understand that those agencies simply don't give a fuck. They will continue their operations regardless of any kind of law. To actually change this, you have to change the whole US corporate + military industrial complex system, and to do that... well, good luck.
What those agencies can not go up against however, is mathematics. They can't force 1 plus 1 to become 3, no matter how hard they try. Luckily, crypto is based on mathematics, and if the open source community manages to implement those mathematics into code *carefully and securely*, then really... those agencies can shit themselves.

Why? Why do you need to convince them?
I employed the following strategy: Every friend that I had, I said that I knew a groundbreaking technology that would potentially change how we think about money. Those who listened became interested in it and followed the rabbit hole. Those who didn't just ignored it, only to be bodyslammed by the fact that 2 rallies came after that. Many of them came to me afterwards saying that I should have warned them better. My response to that was: "I already told you once, you should have listened. Too bad on your part."
So why do you have to try so hard to convince people while you can concentrate on more important things?
As the great Satoshi once said:
“If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry.”

For those who do not want to enable JavaScript to view a fucking webpage:
I've been thinking about ethereum a bit recently. Parts of it are pretty interesting.
Some of it seems like needless re-engineering (like creating a new proof-of-work or a new currency). And in general, I suspect they're trying to do too much-- "complexity is the enemy of security"-- and will end up either radically reducing the scope of what they're trying to do or will get tired of playing whack-a-mole with security and DoS vulnerabilities.
But I might be wrong; maybe I'm just an old, cynical curmudgeon who has played a lot of whack-a-mole with security and DoS vulnerabilities.
Anyway, one of the ideas in ethereum I do find interesting is a contract that has funds associated with it, arbitrary code and state. Verified by the network instead of a central authority. And with transactions as a pseudo-anonymous way of triggering evaluation of the contract, paying funds held in escrow with the contract, and updating its state.
So... could we take that interesting idea and map it onto Bitcoin? Could somebody create "Bit-thereum" on top of Bitcoin as it exists today?
The answer is "yes," if we're willing to replace "verified by the entire network" with "verified by a set of semi-trusted 'oracles'."
That's cheating, though, isn't it? We're not entirely decentralized if we are trusting eleven contract-verifying-services not to collude (or all get hacked) to violate conditions encoded in some contract(s).
It is cheating a bit... but all of the really interesting complex contracts I can think of require data from outside the blockchain. Like the BTC/USD exchange rate on some future date (for blockchain-enforced futures contracts).
ethereum doesn't have some magic solution to the "data outside the blockchain" issue: as their whitepaper says, "[a trusted source is still needed to provide the price ticker.](  And there is already at least one startup working on a solution to the "data outside the Bitcoin blockchain" problem ([Reality Keys](
Moving from one trusted source to M-of-N semi-trusted sources would be an improvement.
So I'll start there, and imagine that there are semi-trusted '[oracles]( that compete to be the most reliable and trustworthy verifiers of contracts. People involved in contracts choose N of them, and then require that contract conditions be validated by one or more of them before the contract pays out. Pick more than one so no single oracle can steal the contract's funds, but less than N in case some of them go out of business or just aren't around to validate contracts when it is time for the contract to pay out.
These oracles need an agreed-upon, machine-readable contract language, but that shouldn't be hard. There are lots of interesting design decisions on what information contract scripts have access to (and lots of not-so-interesting-to-me design decisions on the language itself; is it stack-based, register-based, high-level, low-level bytecode, etc etc etc). Copying most of the ethereum contract language design (and maybe re-using lots of their code) might be a good way to go.
Maybe off-blockchain data would fetched from the web via URI. The tricky bit would be how to handle error conditions like "This contract is about average temperature in Aruba according to the World Bank, but the World Bank is no longer publishing that information."
They also need a way to store some value in escrow, associated with the contract, so that M-of-N of them must agree to any release of funds. Bitcoin multi-signature transactions could be used for that:
1. Whoever is involved in the contract gives the contract code to each of the N oracles and gets back N public keys.
2. The oracles would store the contract code and the private key, and should be willing to give out the public key to anybody who knows the contract code.
3. Anybody can then add funds to the contract by sending bitcoins into the M-of-N multisig made up of the public keys. And maybe associate some data with the escrowed funds by hashing it and include a prune-able OP_RETURN output with the hash.
So far, nothing tricky either on the Bitcoin side or the oracle's side. But what happens when it is time for the oracles to evaluate the contract and disburse some or all of the funds? What triggers the oracles to evaluate the contract (and update any state associated with the contract), and who creates and broadcasts the disburse-funds-from-escrow transaction?
Those are interesting design decisions. I'd probably have whoever is getting paid be responsible for creating the disbursement transaction, contacting M of N oracles to get signatures and then broadcast the transaction. When I say "whoever" I really mean some contract software running either in the cloud or on somebody's machine.
When to update the state associated with a contract is another interesting design decision. My intuition is a contract's state should be tied to Bitcoin transaction confirmations and the state of the transaction outputs being spent. So a contract could be in several states at once if one or more of its inputs are double-spends. Once blockchain confirmations choose one side of the double-spend or another the state of the contract would also be resolved.
I imagine the contract code would have access to all of the unspent transaction outputs (and associated OP_RETURN data, plus metadata like how many confirmations they have, which block they appeared in, maybe their merkle branch...) plus the disbursement transaction outputs. Another interesting design decision is how to handle unconfirmed transaction outputs; I suspect that letting contracts respend zero-confirmation outputs, combined with a promise from the oracles that they will never sign the same output twice might be incredibly powerful and allow all sorts of interesting applications.
Oracles could be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks-- e.g. an attacker requesting an endless number of public keys for contracts they have no intention of fulfilling. Or an attacker requesting an endless number of contract evaluations (and signatures).
To solve the first problem, oracles could require a small up-front payment to establish a contract. And to solve the second, oracles could require that any escrow disbursement also include a small payment (they would simply refuse to sign any escrow disbursement transaction that did not include a payment to their public key). All that makes economic sense, and gives oracle operators a clear business model.
Leveraging Bitcoin transactions for the escrow/funding parts of the problem protects oracles from a whole other set of possible denial-of-service attacks; for example, "penny-flooding" a contract to make it very CPU-expensive for the oracle to evaluate would cost the attacker a significant amount of Bitcoin transaction fees.
Oracles might also put limits in their terms of service to fend off potential attackers, and collaborate to confiscate escrowed funds if an attacker created a very expensive-to-validate contract.: "Any contract that uses more than one CPU-microsecond to validate may be terminated with the funds disbursed in equal amounts to the N validating oracles."  They would maintain their reputations by publishing all of the information about the rogue contract.
But... but... doesn't it have to be more complicated than that? New Bitcoin Script opcodes? Contract code in the blockchain? A merged-mined chain or new colored coin or something?
I don't think so. Bitcoin already provides a global currency and distributed ledger-- there is no need to re-invent those wheels. Combining real-world information with Bitcoin is where things start to get really interesting.

Very cool! I myself am doing electronic music production with things like Bitwig Studio (programs like that are called a DAW = Digital Audio Workstations), which is like the Half Life 3 of DAWs. The one thing I like about Bitwig is that it has native Linux support, so I guess making it work under OpenBSD would be somewhat easier than letting a native Windows DAW work.
One thing that bothers me though is the immensity of the documentation that OpenBSD has. I mean... it's so much, and most of it is in man pages! :D

Does participating in JoinMarket as participant (someone who gets percentage of transactions for obfuscating, not sure what it's called) do you have to run a full node? If so then that's a win-win situation from the lack of nodes we have.
The elephant in the room obviously is... is this software to be trusted? I know that given enough eyes I can run an OpenBSD server with Bitcoin core, store a bunch of BTC there and not worry about stuff because it has all been audited. Adding Python, libsodium and numpy is definitely going to add some complexity to all of that. So how about security?

I really like for it to be like this, I really do. However, the sad reality is that unless you're a (quality) programmer, there is little chance that you'll be paid in BTC. Just look at the various Bitcoin job sites: About 95% of the job listings there are for developers. You have to ask yourself: Who are the people which were first into the Bitcoin economy? Technical people. Who are building the infrastructure right now? Technical people.
I'm by no means saying that this is a bad thing. In fact, I'd rather have that most of the BTC *is* in the hands of the actual builders instead of the leeches and parasites, but sadly this gives the common people ample way of earning in the Bitcoin economy.

It's actually quite simple. All of my close friends and family are either near broke and/or are on benefit, also they have no slightest clue what Bitcoin is. Sufficed to say I don't have many friends.
As collateral I want to stake a couple of my domain names which I've bought over the years.
As for why I don't want the cheaper stuff, it's because if I have free electricity, I might as well go with a 60W block which can fit into my bag and carry it to work (where there is free electricity).

I too, have no idea what time weighs. A quick look into Google revealed me some theoretical physics articles that only Gordon Freeman could understand. 
I'm also confused about why a betting website should behave like a market or why it's a bad thing that they hold your money. I mean... when you place a bet you essentially give the money to an escrow which then (according to the outcome) distributes the collected money accordingly.

If I understand correctly, in your situation either:
1). That wasn't the actual URL to Google Docs.
2). It was the URL but it didn't have the Google certificate.
3). It was the URL to Google Docs *and* it had the Google certificate.
Option  would be the worse, since that means that a malicious party would have Google's certs, in which case we have to worry about much, much bigger things.
Also... regarding [this]( source which was linked in your Coindesk article:


 
This is so incredibly vague that it's really hard to comprehend.


This falls under the 3 options I mentioned earlier. I strongly suspect it would have been option 1 or 2.

Projects like the [Novena]( [LowRISC]( and the up-coming [Turris router]( are making some headway, but either it's just a project on paper (LowRISC), or there are still some closed source elements in the design (Novena and Turris Omnia, in particular WiFi adapter).

Have you actually read the article instead of the title? Like fully?
He simply says that in the future, we might not even realize we're using the BTC blockchain, or even have BTC as main dominant cryptocurrency. I think he's referring to decentralization of archaic hierarchical information entities in general. Considering the rapid movement of this technology, that's actually a very safe statement to make, don't you think?
IMO this thread is an example of taking things out of context mainly for benefit of other (competing) companies.
@_date: 2015-10-15 05:21:05
Protip: Many buttcoiners are not inherently hostile against Bitcoin as they're hostile against this toxic community (which it is).
Also, the fact that 95% of the social media channels of a decentralized technology is controlled by one single person is pretty hilarious too IMO.

I think I'm one of those people. My friends say that I have so much ideas that I'm good for starting multiple highly profitable companies. It's just that I need people to be able to implement them. The problem is that I'm very insecure about working with other people, especially with the potential of them running away with my ideas or in the long run making the company toxic (both in a financial way and a public way). 
I consider my ideas my 'babies' and I re-iterate every possible outcome inside my head. I simply want the best for my ideas.
I'm not someone who has high standards of living or wants to make it big and rich. I just want to live financially independent in such a way that in my own comfort I can devote my life to making music, coming up with even better ideas and traveling around the world. Is that so much to ask for?

I won't beg Bitcoins of you but instead I'll humbly ask you to consider their stances on the vast potential of Bitcoin on the world. People who got in early were foreseeing enough to realize Bitcoin's power, and of those people there are a lot who want to better the world. As of now, and surely later, they will get this chance and it's in their hands to decide whether to stick with their ideals or to become the very thing they hated.
I hope you make a choice which will reflect positive things on the world. Because now, you can.

ECDSA = Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm = encryption algorithm used to calculate your private and public keys which are used for your Bitcoin addresses.
**Private key** = your private address, must be kept secret under all times if you don't wish that other people spend the coins you own. The one who has this address ([which is basically a long string of abstracted ones and zeroes]( can make an infinite amount of public addresses / keys and make [transactions](
**Public key** = your public address, it's the Bitcoin addresses that people hand out on the web to receive sweet Bitcoin moneyz. A public address is derived from a private address, *but this operation is mathematically very difficult if not impossible to do in reverse*
A more technical explanation about addresses is [here](
What theymos means is that if ECDSA to be somehow broken one day, people would be able to derive the private key... from the public addresses! You could imagine that this would create a bit of a problematic situation.
I myself don't understand the intricacies of the ECDSA algorithm, but I hope someday, I'll be able to understand like you hopefully understood my explanation :)

Basically right now when people check in, they have to use a paper registration form, but I want to make a kiosk which also stores that info in a (MySQL) database.

The tip bot.
Ok, so basically a user who wants to donate Bitcoin to you on Reddit comments a certain sentence (often in a reply) which the bot then picks up. What happens is that the donating user has a wallet maintained by Reddit's bitcointip bot. So the bot is actually holding to all the wallets of the Reddit users who use the bitcointip.
Once the tip bot sees that sentence, it deducts the amount of BTC from the donating user's account and holds it until you claim the BTC to your account. The tip bot does that by notifying you by sending you a private message that the Bitcoins are held 'in limbo' until you claim them. If you don't claim them in 21 days then the BTC gets returned to the sending account. If you do claim them, the BTC then gets transferred to your account which the tip bot then maintains (so basically the tip bot maintains a ledger of all Reddit users who are also bitcointip users).
Once in your account you can tip people. [Here's a youtube tutorial](

Be aware that as more computing power gets added to the network the harder it becomes to mine a block. It used to be as easy as mining with the CPU (because it's basically a general processor). Then someone wrote mining software which could utilize the GPU (which is much more efficient than a CPU), then FPGA's came (which was more efficient than a GPU) and now we're at specialized mining machines called ASICs (they're the final boss, they do one thing and one thing only but extremely efficiently... which is mine Bitcoin).
When buying an ASIC you should firstly consider things like delivery date, W/GH/s (how much it can mine per Watt) and the rising difficulty (because yeah... more and more people are starting to mine with ASICs).
I was too lazy to mine myself, but instead I invested in mining stocks. They're basically huge mining operations which issue a certain amount of shares. The Bitcoin which gets mined by that mining operation then gets distributed to the shareholders as dividends. The ownership of shares is determined by A). Bitcoin addresses and B). A ledger which the mining operation has to know how much shares are distributed among what Bitcoin addresses.
Funny fact: It used to be that those ledgers were hosted at websites that went down because of regulation, but you can build on a certain technology called Colored Coins on top of the Bitcoin technology which enables you to fully decentralize this ledger (like Bitcoin itself is fully decentralized). This enables fully decentralized stock markets.
I myself invested in ASICMINER (IPO @ 0.1 BTC, highest price around 5 BTC) and Active Mining (IPO 0.0025 BTC, highest price around 0.009 BTC).
Great stuff eh?

One of the elements of value is trust. You trust that gold can't be made, only mined. Same way you can trust that no one is doing a 51% attack as of now.
Another element is merchant acceptance penetration, and that has been increasing since Bitcoin's inception.

To think even for a second that the Dutch are positive about Bitcoin is a gross misconception. The big consensus here is that it's being compared to play money and, during the price soars, to tulip mania. The Dutch had their fair share of scams and financial scandals to be very skeptic about new financial technologies. Sadly (for them at least), when they hear about a 'virtual currency' they almost immediately disregard it as WoW Gold 2.0 or Linden Dollars++. Some even go to as far as to research it, but when they read the Wikipedia page they still disregard it because it's too much trouble for them to understand. To quote another user here, [this will perhaps be their most costly mistake](
But in a way, this lies in a deeper, more cultural level. Dutch are very good at using their 'boerenverstand' (translated: farmer's reasoning), which basically means very simple but very sober way of thinking. They know what banks are because they have experience with them for hundreds of years now. The concept of a bank is rather simple to understand. In fact, one of the now biggest international banks were started by farmers. To even begin to grasp a notion of the almost unreal possibilities of Bitcoin is far too much for most of the Dutch to grasp.
"Wa un boer nie kent da vrit ie nie."
In old Dutch dialect translated as "What a farmer isn't familiar with, he doesn't eat."
A very relevant saying indeed.

You assume that Twitter's presentation style is somehow beneficial to the Github discussion. The best way to tackle intricate technical discussions is to get the post anchor from the  or otherwise get a brief summary of the post (using a JS time delayed popup). By clicking on it you can go to that post, and then when clicking on the *username of that particular post* should you only go to the username's profile page. If however a  is mentioned without previous participation in the discussion, then it's safe to say that it is indeed most efficient to go straight to username's profile.
'Knowing' is of course a relative term in the UX field, as any well respected member in the UX community will agree.

I really do hope it stays like that, but I do frequently get the feeling of being in the early Internet days, where it was filled with hackers and people who actually had to say something instead of selling you stuff.

I'm a bit of a proponent of Bitcoin myself, but I'd say that's very wishful thinking.
In fact, every opinion and prediction on Satoshi is wishful thinking. We don't know what his/her/their/its intentions are. If Satoshi would dump all of his/her/their/its mined BTC then no one would stop him/her/them/it from doing so. In fact, he/she/they/it could wait for it until BTC is well vested in the economy and do so just to destabilize the whole financial system. Why? Well... I personally would do it just for the lulz.
**edit**: Yeah, go ahead and downvote me. Let's not talk about valid attack vectors of Bitcoin and just go with the flow in the echo chamber.

You think other fiat currency will fill its place (temporarily)?
@_date: 2013-06-24 15:28:35
But what if they... don't cease and desist?
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:35:51


Yeah but it used to be optional. Now it appears to be mandatory.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:13:29
So what's your plan?
@_date: 2013-02-26 10:18:44
I can't wait to be learn about all of this, thanks very much :)
@_date: 2013-06-14 15:14:43
...and it's gone.
Also some clown managed to [add this to the profile description](

But aren't hashes used for encryption? Isn't ECDSA actually an encryption method? What's the difference between hashing and encryption then?
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:23:09




If that were truly so then would be ranked higher than Just sayan...

You have no idea how holy Bitcoin is for me. I tell it to EVERYONE I come across.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:59:55
Forgive me for asking, but what is a spread?
@_date: 2013-06-17 10:12:57


Basically I can make money, convert it to Bitcoin, create a unique brainwallet, dump it there. Next, I can do all sorts of crazy shit and no one can touch my wealth :3
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:43:59
Dunno, IMO Demonoid sucked so much that it could very well also be called a scam.
@_date: 2013-06-21 13:04:28
Why do you need Shopify if you have things like OpenBitcoinStore??
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:21:39
But the offline Armory doesn't even need to be synchronized or have Bitcoin-Qt running.
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:12:33
Not sure, I'm not a web developer. Does one have to have a test suite to audit HTML+JS+CSS code?
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:14:10
Wait, I was thinking that intrinsic value meant the value that gold derived from being able to be used such as in industrial applications?
@_date: 2013-02-02 05:04:12
Thank you very much for this. As a poor student this made me realize that the margins really suck for amounts under 10000 euro's.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:35:29
Are you leaving forever? Is it because you made a fortune with BTC? Because I would like to do that too one day :(
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:13:24
Do not agree, I understood it after reading numerous comments on Reddit and a few blogposts. The paper is definitely not understood by 'the average Joe' who doesn't know anything about cryptography or tech.
@_date: 2013-02-26 09:09:26
Great idea, I'm thinking about doing it too. But in all honesty sometimes I get the feeling that almost no one in this sub has ever heard about @_date: 2013-06-21 09:42:22
I would to a lot more than that if I'd have as many shares as that guy.
Thinking about it... perhaps it could still be a viable business idea if I started offering silly dances in tutus for AM shares.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:05:56
Damn, this kills the Bitcoin merchant adoption.
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:59:39
They can still claim it's not their address though.

From now on she's called Mel BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-19 22:32:20
Because it's located in the US?
Any US based hosting company should have a bad WOT rating.

Some of the greatest ideas were born from moaning about things, and these days ideas tend to get viral.

I will never call myself a hacker, no matter what kind of knowledge I possess. Always a computer enthusiast or IT professional (if making money). Calling myself a hacker opens all kinds of wormcans. I know when I did some hacking here and there, people around me suddenly weren't comfortable using their smartphones and one time I got banned from using computers in a library. Yep, computer enthusiast it is.

Me too :D
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:36:51
The account said AM, so I'm guessing it has something to do with ASICMINER.
@_date: 2013-10-23 07:36:46
Wasn't it by 2045 instead of 2025?
@_date: 2013-06-24 03:27:27
So for example when a website (operating in the US) gets a cease and desist order the best action is not to do any action?
Why do most websites comply then?
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:50:34
That would take a considerable amount of interaction with the banks. It's a great idea, I've been talking about it for ages as a solution to the hoarding problem, but it's a pretty difficult thing to do.

[Can you please explain why Chromium didn't make it on the list?](
@_date: 2013-03-29 13:52:53
Very nicely done video!
What are they screaming in Greek at the start?
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:30:46
Not sure why they're sending bitcoins through twitter with coinbase while you have an integrated solution called pikapay.com
@_date: 2013-09-29 16:38:16
If you don't know what that means, then I don't think it's a good idea for you to come to and instead of asking for more knowledge, simply start discussing things as if you know how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:29:40
It's a fork of the Bitcoin network. Based on a different cryptography algorithm (scrypt instead of sha256) and supposedly can process transactions faster. But it is what it is, a fork of Bitcoin like many alternative currencies are these days.
@_date: 2013-11-16 08:09:47
What? How?
@_date: 2013-08-16 14:15:54
Yep! I'm a normal person too hehe.
Feels good to be normal. Not worrying about anything unusual and stuff. Feels great! I really do hope people think I'm as normal as I sound, because that's what being normal is about, right?
Well, I'm off for now. I hope I'll get to talk to you soon at normal conventions and normal clubs.
Stay normal now!

And yet you can't get it if you don't have Google Play.
Google purposely removed its authenticator download link from the project page... which is open source.

Incoming! :O

1 to 3 business days. As of now I began the transfer to Bitstamp on 11/04 and it's only a few hours ago that it was confirmed to be deposited.
Yes my friend, it's hard in having patience in the traditional banking system after you got used to the Bitcoin speeds. Once you Bit you won't ever quit :p
@_date: 2013-06-16 04:37:19
...to make some ripples?
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:20:55
I am so glad you did! I really am. But please *share your experience and findings* so that you help not only yourself but other people as well. Thank you :)
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:31:57
Absolutely, but if you look closely I use the term "most Dutch people". I have no doubt that Bitcoin generates growing interest in certain intellectual communities, especially where knowledge of technology is prevalent.
@_date: 2013-06-24 15:50:01
I would like to know that too. 6% of gain of a share per year? That means that it will repay itself in yeeeeeaaaaars. That's unrealistic, I expect my shares which I bought for 2 BTC to be repaid this year.
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:15:31
Ah great, more ASIC miners. So how do we know this isn't a scam as well?
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:00:34
A planet where many people apparently don't read history.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:32:39
What if you don't end up making enough money? Why not just a paywall then?
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:45:33


Well hopefully if it does the job right it will stumble and kill the gox lag problem. So I couldn't think of a better name in that case.
Seriously, why not concentrate on testing it and making it a reality rather than discussing the name (which I dearly like and is entirely subjective).
@_date: 2013-06-16 17:06:31
*if Bitcoin still has any significant financial value by then.

Did you hear him say that the first ticket was sold to a *stewardess* who invested early on? One of the early adopters... is a *she* :O
@_date: 2013-07-30 13:53:06
This is something new (to me at least). They should definitely write this down on their site with big red letters.
