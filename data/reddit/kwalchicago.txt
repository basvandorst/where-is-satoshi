Will you delete this when the exact opposite happens?
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:41:18
Weird,  where are you from? Not a single one of those issues exists here with me and my Paypal account and I'm in the US. They've really got you tied down over there!

Betting yes but I wasn’t being specific to the ad in this game but crypto in general during this breakout period 
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:47:57
I use it for P2P when I have to so I haven’t seen anything like that on my end. Do they scalp profits off of currency conversions?

Unfortunately not every industry needs blockchain.. So while it's popular now most of these companies won't exist within a few years.

I’m with you on the adoption aspect of it but I’d also like to think that if they’re even willing to take a leap of faith and accept BTC they should trust it enough at that point to stake some of it as an investment. Seems like it would be costly to accept it and immediately convert to USD as each single conversion would be a taxable event 
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:03:28
Holy shit I love this
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:38:10
Sounds like they should just stick to the traditional ways of payment then if they just want to immediately convert to USD...
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:55:40
I’m well aware of what happened.. So what?
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:03:37
I switched over to the Authy app because it allows me to log in on a new device if something ever happens. It's totally up to them on how long it'll take, just be glad you already got the process in motion.

I mean they likely have multiple hubs, all of which are centralized in their region... What are you trying to get at?
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:17:00
Vouch. CNBC is an AWFUL source for anything crypto related. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 18:26:16
@_date: 2018-06-12 11:03:26
I’m sure that’s good for business 
@_date: 2018-06-18 12:41:00
I spent $60 of BTC from my Electrum wallet yesterday and my fee was $0.02.

"VisaNet is a centralized and modular payments network"
@_date: 2018-06-01 16:12:04
Centralization at it's finest

Blame banks. Banks hold all of your sensitive information and get hacked all the time. It takes days for a deposited check to clear in 2018. If you want to move your money they want to know why. 
The list just goes on. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:05:44
Have they set another deadline? Last time I checked Q4 2017 was when their card should've been available to US residents but it didn't happen for whatever reason. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:31:49
I knew this was going to turn into a Bcash shill
@_date: 2018-03-05 23:02:52
Spend it or hold it.. Its your choice. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:18:13
Ha, yeah now that I think about it I may have to give her a pop quiz this week. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:43:22
I still can't believe Bcash made it onto Coinbase that quick.. Roger Ver needs to exit this space once and for all. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 23:49:16
If you can only invest $1000 and slowly make good trades and end up with let's $2000 a year later then that's still considered a good return. You won't be rich, but that kind of growth can be easily achieved. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:58:28
This is laid out on their website in a pretty easy to understand fashion last time I checked... I assume you’re in the states? If so there’s no fee to simply make purchases unless you go over the daily limit which was either $5000 or $10000. There are fees like that for international purchases though. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:00:39
You end up getting money back but it causes an inconvenience. You can also have your identity stolen this way.

@_date: 2018-02-26 12:16:43
Wow thanks 
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:48:16
I took some time to show my wife how to access everything.. That’s at least a head start. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:52:10
They’ve had an option to accept payment in cryptocurrency*
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:11:18
The streets 
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:04:42
You can just send your BTC to the Bitpay wallet and spend.. Seems pretty simple to me. How come that's not an option for you if you don't mind me asking? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:36:33
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:45:03
I'm with ya on that. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 01:54:19
lol no thanks 
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:35:48
Nice one mate 
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:54:52
Good choice lol
