I am personally switching to alt-coins. IOTA is looking very promising with some others. I believe bitcoin has become too mainstream with people investing because of speculation, not for the technology. Transaction fees are way too high atm as well.

Poloniex or Bittrex

LTC may drop too, since it rose 40% today

High risk, high reward. If you are feeling bold, go for it.

People who realized that bitcoin technology is outdated and there are many alt-coins that are better

Get a hardware wallet. Nano ledger or Trezor are pretty reliable.

Mine still shows the fees

There are so many coins that are technologically better than bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:07:01

 I think you are confusing left and right with libertarian and authoritarian 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:39:05
