Real estate is also I good solution in order to protect wealth. I disagree on the security statement but that’s ok difference of opinion. The German Mark was printed into oblivion at least with Bitcoin there’s a fixed amount of 21 million. There’s many different ways to protect yourself from inflation/ a recession. It’s good to have diversity. I think we can agree that the dollar is failing!

Electrum is a pretty good wallet I have had nothing but delight. It is on the basic side but as long as your not storing crazy amounts of Bitcoin you should be fine!
@_date: 2019-10-10 03:02:27
That being said I don’t like coinbase as well!

Also music is intellectual property so it really is a form of thief. P2P money based on a decentralized blockchain is in now way theft it is simply a transfer of value!

Definitely give to some friend and get them started with bitcoin would be much more rewarding and valuable to you then the 80$.

Well the dollar is backed by nothing it has been around since 1776 however, since it has been taken off the gold/silver standard it’s really just paper. Bitcoin is backed by cost of mining as well as security of the network! Once the dollar fails people will look for a new form of value bitcoin is the best solution to hyperinflation besides precious metals!

A rally will happen when it happens no one thing will lead to a rally there are so many factors when it comes to Bitcoin. The only thing I could see causing large scale growth/price movement is the halving!

Nobody should disclose any financial info to anyone especially someone on reddit. Really dumb question lol
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:45:11
Thank you it’s one of those things we as a community should be thinking about if the future is to last!

That’s untrue I have a limit of 1000 per day!

Well a lot of people think Bitcoin is the next money and won’t spend for fiat no matter the price such as myself! However, on the other hand u have pump and dumpers who want nothing more that to sell for a profit which in all honesty is fine to if that’s your thing. Just like there’s people who want you to succeed cause they love you or they want you to succeed so they will!

There are some Decentralized exchanges out there were it’s completely peer to peer! You could always try the same thing with Zcash as well they use zero knowledge proofs. Hope this helps u avoid the IRS��

Because our current society is still largely based on the dollar therefore, it would be unwise to go all in on Crypto. I think the world and specifically the US are moving to a blockchain based cryptocurrency only time will tell! When the time comes I’m ready to abandon the dollar it’s truly worth nothing they just print it into oblivion!

That didn’t wander my question about implementing a treasury system!
@_date: 2019-09-10 05:55:06
Thanks I’m definitely not a whale at least not yet lol I’ll definitely look into electrum!
@_date: 2019-09-30 09:22:27
Very true thankfully also the opposite is true the bigger it grows the less crazy run ups we’ll have!
@_date: 2019-09-10 05:55:30
Thank you!

I wouldn’t store any of my funds on any kind of exchange always the risk of an attack. Also I don’t trust coinbase therefore, I want control over my own coins. There are a lot of great wallets with all kinds of features just do your research!
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:15:07
I’ll do anything for Bitcoin ������
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:42:05
No it’s fine I mean the wallet probably works well if you want to keep your coins with coinbase that’s the only risk. It’s kinda one of those things we’re u think to yourself do I really have the coins and the control over my money. See my point! If your looking for a good wallet I’d recommend Electrum a lot of cool features and very simple to use!
@_date: 2019-09-24 09:26:35
So a full node wallet would fall under the category of a node that doesn’t validate blocks am I correct?
@_date: 2019-09-10 05:54:18
Thanks that sounds interesting I’ll look into it!
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:38:19
That didn’t answer my question about implementing a treasury system!
@_date: 2019-09-21 22:29:24
Oh I thought this about Bitcoin Sv my bad ��
@_date: 2019-09-30 09:23:44
Same you would think they’d be the ones hodling and we the ones interested lmao
