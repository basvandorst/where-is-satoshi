Are there any moderators on streamium.io? How does this site ban inappropriate streams?

I've collected almost a dollar via changetip for doing virtually nothing. There are countries where people live on one dollar a day. I think I'll make someone really happy today.

Don't waste your time, bro. The people of Russia were fucked over too many times by the government and schmucks like Mavrodi. We don't trust anything anymore. We try to stick to what works and is proved by time. The mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies in Russia will come  only when the head of Russian Orthodox Church buys a new flashy car with his bitcoins.

If your post/comment had 10 000 views and each person tipped you 1 cent, you would get 100 dollars. You wouldn't think that tipping such small amounts was a silly thing, right? 
here's 200 bits for you. @_date: 2014-10-18 12:46:47
Bitcoin, as we know, resembles a Ponzi scheme and Russians, as few know, have a really bad history with Ponzi schemes.

It's good, but it makes me feel suspicious for some reason. I don't know I think there's something fishy about the man. He looks like a con artist of the early 20's or something.

I just need a couple of bits to tip other people on YouTube. I hope this will increase adoption in the smallest way possible. Thank you! 
@_date: 2014-11-10 06:28:41
It is real! Here's 200 bits for you! @_date: 2014-11-01 07:10:00

What category of YouTube users is most ready/open to Bitcoin? I mean, who is most likely to investigate and accept Bitcoin as a game-changer after he gets a tip?  Geeks, gamers, or ...?

The next step is blockchain-based smart derivatives so that we can achieve the same thing without the counterparty risk.

Hey! Am I too late?

Hmm... looks like somebody owes you 5000 bits.

Are they open-source?

Why do posts that mention Ethereum on r/Bitcoin get so furiously downvoted?
@_date: 2015-07-07 03:50:05
The next Reddit will be based on Ethereum

Yes, it was looking like something from Shapeshift.io

This add disappeared shortly after the price started to rise. The banner was either on coindesk.com or coinmarketcap.com. — I don't remember.
