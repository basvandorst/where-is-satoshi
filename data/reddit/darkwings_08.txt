Yes, just like a Rube Goldberg machine
What matters is it actually of any use, or does it have potential to be transformed into something of use?
At the moment, Bitcoin has very little use. It cannot even be used as a reliable medium of exchange because of the extreme volatility that has plagued it since it began years ago.
If the protocol *of* Bitcoin has potential use, then whatever that use becomes, it won't be Bitcoin the currency, which is what I'm referring to.
Bitcoin as a currency is utter garbage.
If the invention of the protocol of Bitcoin is equivalent to the invention of the Internet, then Bitcoin the currency is equivalent to the Dot-com company broadcast.com

@_date: 2014-01-15 16:19:24
Your reply does not address two of the important points I made: That surplus demand will increase volatility, and low volume will also increase volatility
Your argument is that it costs more to move the market if the price is higher, but this does not take into account volume.
The price could go down to $0.01 in one trade worth $0.01, so long as there is only one buyer and one seller who has only 1 BTC.
That is an exaggeration, but if most of the Bitcoins are hoarded rather than actively traded, then what you might end up with is say 5000 BTC traded in a day (just for example). At a price of $100,000, that would be 500 million dollars worth, and so it would take *much less than that* to 'move the market' at any given time. I use these figures just as a comparison to today's current global daily exchange volume, which is much higher in value.
It doesn't matter what price or volume you want to estimate, because by encouraging hoarding, you are saying the proportion of volume to price will always be lower than what it is today. This means it will be easier to move the market.

**Bitcoin is a cult, and the people here are its followers**
"[Maybe attacking the mods like you've been attacking the rest of this subreddit with purely negative comments isn't going to get you what you want. You have no sympathy from me. Try some tact.](
This is the response I got from one of the users here when I pointed out that my posts are being censored (unlisted and [removed] by mods) simply because they express a negative opinion. It is a response that is not uncommon to come across on here.
It demonstrates that at least a substantial number of the people here believe the moderators are beyond criticism; beyond responsibility; and indeed, have the right to act however they please, even if it is the contrary to the set of rules they themselves set out.
Bitcoin strikes me as cult-like. Curious, I decided to lookup 'how to identify a cult'. From the first result, I got this checklist:
* The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader and (whether he is alive or dead) regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law.
* Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
* The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s) and members
* The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.
* The leader is not accountable to any authorities
* The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary.
* The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members. 
* The group is preoccupied with making money.
* The most loyal members (the “true believers”) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group.
How many points on this checklist do you think the 'community' of fulfils?
**ADDED NOTE**: After I posted the above comment in a thread, it was deleted by the mods without warning, as evidenced [here]( Don't allow this outrageous censorship to continue, act against it. At the very least, talk about it. I have no choice but to post this here since the mods are deleting every one of my threads and comments.

Most of them lost their Bitcoins/money in the June 2011 MtGox hack.
Those in the minority who did not get their funds and personal information stolen would have had to wait for two years before seeing a price above $20 again (the 2011 peak was $31.91).
You sound like someone who has only been involved in Bitcoin in the past year or so.
There have also been many other great thefts and fraudulent schemes that have happened since then, losing many people a hell of a lot of money, and those who have had the will to hold on and keep their funds secure are very few in number - that's partly why the price of Bitcoin is so high, because it's the *very* early adopters who hold most of the Bitcoins (and they are mostly forgotten/dormant), and the rest hold very few Bitcoins (most of the remaining supply is hoarded by exchanges, gambling sites, the FBI, thieves, etc.) causing a price squeeze due to lack of supply.

By the time that happens, there probably won't be a need for currency at all
Perhaps everyone's needs will be met thanks to our technological advances which can allow all the work to be done whilst we reap the benefits.
Besides, I can't imagine it being much cheaper, if indeed it is cheaper, than mining here on Earth. Take into account also that the supply here on Earth will be completely exhausted in 50 years or so (unless we find massive economically recoverable reserves, and even that wouldn't last much longer).

It's getting to the root of what you said, based on this:
"Being a libertarian doesn't mean you magically have thick skin. It just means you recognize that private property is a better way to interact socially than through government and coercion."


I was talking about Libertarians and anarchists, neither of which depend on a right to private property - and that wasn't the point anyway as I explained.
The point is that demanding censorship and granting people authority over others to enforce that censorship is contrary to the principles of both Libertarianism and Anarchism.

If you don't sell it or trade it, then you hold nothing of value (by definition, as Bitcoin's only intrinsic value as a medium of exchange and nothing more)
Even the 'early adoptors' are shrimp for the bigger fish. Only a few hundred people, if that, have $100,000 or more.
I believe I did this statistical analysis when Bitcoin was at ~$1200 a month ago: There were 14,767 addresses which held $100,000 or more.
A lot of these addresses will no doubt be held by exchanges and other entities (i.e. the seized funds of the Silk Road) which are not held by individuals.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:49:56




But it does happen. I refer you to the most recent US housing bubble.
And it is actually irrelevant whether a person sells gradually or in one go - what actually matters is whether there is demand meeting it on the other side of the trade. 
Demand may grow, as new buyers are ushered in, but you always run into a fundamental problem in the end: there is a finite number of buyers.
Thus the price growth must come to end as supply levels off to meet demand. Once it begins to slip below it, that's when the big trouble begins. You get a tight squeeze through the exits, as it turns into a panic.
Some people wrongly think that this moment of panic is somehow avoidable. That they can choose to 'hold' and not 'sell off'. This is evidence of a lack of understanding of how markets work - for you have to keep in mind the following: the money has *already* been cashed out before the crash began, and therefore there is no choice but to panic because there is literally no (or hardly any) money left *and* no buyers left.
If you don't believe me, just do the math:
Say you have one guy who sells $1 million of Bitcoin, gradually, early on whilst the bubble is building up. This is bought up by say 2,000 people who invested $1000 each, leaving them each with $500 left, whilst the other one guy cashes out with $1 million.
Sometime later the crash comes because the market has run out of new buyers, and everybody wants at least their $1000 back (they don't realize they've already lost at least of half their money). 
Lets say 10% get out at $1000, 10% get out at $900, and 10% get out at $800. Do the math and you'll realize that that only leaves $328.57 left each for the remaining 1400 people!
Do you see where this is going?

But in actual fact, it's a good question, and one I think a lot of people here are just now beginning to ask - and asking the question of themselves about whether they want to continue with their 'investment' in bitcoin anymore, particularly if they're holding on to losses having bought in at ~$1000+

There is nothing anarchical about defending the rights to free speech and free expression. In fact it is the opposite of anarchy, it is building a human system of order.
I touch on the reason why we need this system of order in my original post, by quoting from a renowned play, and I'll repeat it for your benefit (or at least the benefit of others):
* William Roper: So, now you give the Devil the benefit of law!
* Sir Thomas More: Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?
* William Roper: Yes, I'd cut down every law in England to do that!
* Sir Thomas More: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?
I also recommend you (and others) read John Stuart Mill's [*On Liberty*]( which isn't too long a read and is well worth the effort.

Yes, however that zero sum game can be big or small.
I'm glad the bubble popped at $1242, though I wish it were earlier, because the fact that a lot of people are going to lose their money is now unavoidable.
The task now is to prevent this from developing into a bigger bubble, both in the near and distant future.
Also if those who bought at high prices sell first, then they will recoup at least most of what they put in, and so the final distribution will end up looking near fair.
Alas that is extremely unlikely to happen, and neckbeards and charlatans have already cashed out millions of dollars, but it should nonetheless be encouraged.

You really think that ordinary people are going to be bothered going through all that, or be able to understand it?
Even the younger generations don't understand much about the technology they use. They just like to buy their iPhones and prebuilt computers, and if they have a problem with it, they can send it to the 'computer repair man'.
You're deluded if you think 'the masses' and the 'average people' are going to do all that you've said you want them to do.

My advice is obviously aimed at those intending to hold Bitcoin for a month or longer; not day-trading.
By 'go back up immediately' I meant not as you understand it - it would be absurd for me to say that the price does not go up at all, or in significant amounts, for that would mean I deny dead-cat bounces exist!
Rather, what I meant by 'go back up' is that the price will not exceed $1242 for quite a long time. This time period is unknown, it may take several months; sometimes it takes years. It could take place in days. My point however is that the price must go to where the speculation began before it can make that new high (above $1242). This is why I say the price will go to $200 or below before it ever reaches $1242 again, because that is the price level at which I believe the serious speculation started.
I said you can see this in charts of other bubbles, because you can. No bubble ever goes through a downtrend like Bitcoin has, and then out of the blue starts making fresh highs. That's just not how the investing cycle works. The speculators have to be mentally ground into a pulp before the price can start an long-term uptrend again. 
This is not some kind of magic, it makes sense logically: If a price goes up during a downtrend, then the speculator is encourage to sell, causing downward pressure on the price.
This is what is behind the phenomenon of the 'dead cat bounce' for instance, and it *always* appears.

Actually it is true, and anyone who says 'it's an assumption' mustn't be aware of the data that is available
I haven't looked at the data for this stat myself, but I have looked at it for other statistics, and this claim seems to line up. For instance here are some of the statistics I pulled before:
* 5000.00 Bitcoins or more - 224 addresses
* 2000.00 Bitcoins or more - 598 addresses
* 1000.00 Bitcoins or more - 1,447 addresses
Now even if you assumed the lowest possible amount of 5000 Bitcoin for each of the 224 addresses, and so on, you get a total of 3,763,000 Bitcoins.
At a price of $863/BTC, that's 3.25 billion dollars, or 30% of the total market cap - and that's just for the first 2269 addresses!

On a side note, isn't it ironic how Bitcoin is often described as 'decentralized' and 'Libertarian', but the community is under centralized control and ruled with an authoritarian iron fist. Soon the protocol will too fall victim to this, as we have begun to witness through the potential 51% attack and encouraged government  regulation of Bitcoin because it 'legitimizes' it.

The problem is that this 'limit' doesn't correspond with the rules of the subreddit
If there was one set of rules governing all users, then that might still be detestable, but at least it wouldn't be hypocritical.
What has happened is that there is a set of rules which apply to me and a different set of rules to apply to others.
Not only is this hypocritical, but the mods (judah_mu at least) are trying to keep the community from learning about it by reinstating my threads after I make public that the threads have been unjustly unlisted.
The moderators have a duty to the community of this subreddit to moderate in fairness and with justness, and with transparency. I stand by this view, and I don't give a le shit whether it's stated in the reddit rules or not - you just have to take a look at what happened in r/Politics to see what happens when mods have too much power and allowed to become corrupt.

They were simply humorous exaggerations mirroring the desperation at the time of Bitcoin speculators (most of them newcomers) trying to sell whilst the price was crashing, from $266 down to ~$60.
A real example from the period: 
I received a lot of messages from users here who legitimately believed (or hoped) I was selling at price points of $40, $25, etc. but I did not reply to any of these. They are still in my inbox. Some users claimed in the comments section that I actively tried to scam them or whatever, but this is false.

Copied from original post:
"Price support is fading fast
Volume levels are lower than they've been in months, which means there's no change-of-hands going on. This is a bad sign because it means either sellers are holding on to losses they're waiting to offload at higher levels, or buyers are spooked and the recent moderate price rise is essentially a gimmick. Low volume = unreliable short-term moves.
Expect a smackdown by the time it reaches the ~$850-$870 level"

I have no desire to invest in Bitcoin because I know that it's a pyramid scheme.
Two reasons why I do not regret investing into Bitcoin when it was at a lower price:
* I would have either lost or cashed out my Bitcoins early on. For instance if I had Bitcoins in MtGox during June 2011, I would have likely lost them (the password for the email address I was using was cracked). I took notice again of Bitcoin early last year when it had risen again to $30, however I know that if I had bought at the time I would have sold at $40 or $50. 
* In pyramid schemes, which Bitcoin is, you have to be extremely lucky to be a winner, even if you do happen to be an early investor. Think about it: when someone cashes out $1 million from Bitcoins he mined 3 years ago, that's 1000 people who have invested $1000 each who have lost any chance of seeing any of their money again. So for every big winner, there are a great many losers, and it's impossible to predict the exact height of the bubble, let alone have the frame of mind to sell. You might as well buy a lottery ticket.
The fact is that 'bitcoin knowledge, industry, volume, and utility' do not matter because a) People are only speculating on Bitcoin, not investing in it because of the fundamentals, and b) Bitcoin can function even if it has near zero fiat value - it is not a store of value, it can only function as a medium of exchange (but due to extreme volatility it can't even do that anymore; it's worthless garbage).

@_date: 2014-01-07 20:11:29
*Copy of the post in case the mods [remove] my post:*
I wrongly believed that the price had peaked at ~$870 and would have then resumed the downtrend, although I did qualify the prediction with 'quite likely' rather than certainty in the title if you go back and look over my posts.
Rather what we have seen is a spike that has been strong enough to push through up to near $1100, but has now resumed to falling in line with the overall downtrend.
Looking at the chart, perhaps this just a larger form of a dead-cat bounce. Compare for instance what happened back in April, when the price dropped from $266 to $50, only to recover to a peak of $166 a week later, before continuing the long decline of many months down to ~$65. These events look practically identical on a chart.
My firm prediction has always been this: That Bitcoin will go to $200 or less before it ever goes above $1242 again.
As I type this, the price of Bitcoin is down $140 in about the time span of about a day, from $1094 to $954.

Most of these taxes could be averted by simply under-reporting the value of transactions/items or not reporting them at all.

**Bitcoin is a cult, and the people here are its followers**
"[Maybe attacking the mods like you've been attacking the rest of this subreddit with purely negative comments isn't going to get you what you want. You have no sympathy from me. Try some tact.](
This is the response I got from one of the users here when I pointed out that my posts are being censored (unlisted and [removed] by mods) simply because they express a negative opinion. It is a response that is not uncommon to come across on here.
It demonstrates that at least a substantial number of the people here believe the moderators are beyond criticism; beyond responsibility; and indeed, have the right to act however they please, even if it is the contrary to the set of rules they themselves set out.
Bitcoin strikes me as cult-like. Curious, I decided to lookup 'how to identify a cult'. From the first result, I got this checklist:
* The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader and (whether he is alive or dead) regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law.
* Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
* The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s) and members
* The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.
* The leader is not accountable to any authorities
* The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary.
* The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members. 
* The group is preoccupied with making money.
* The most loyal members (the “true believers”) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group.
How many points on this checklist do you think the 'community' of fulfils?

Clearly it only got upvoted because it was positive and reinforced people's delusions on here.
But what strikes me most of all is the schizophrenic personality of this subreddit. Within a few days this user, and this subreddit as a whole, has gone from praising China and saying it's Bitcoin's best hope to utterly denouncing it and saying 'Forget China, we don't need no China!!'

I hope you didn't buy when I posted [this]( when the price was at ~$1220 on November 29th
Or when I [kept warning]( of the impending severe crash just as it begun it's descent
Or when I posted [this]( near the absolute peak of the dead cat bounce (~$1225)

They are scaled almost exactly the same on the only scale that is relevant - time.

There's no point artificially scaling price and volume on the same axis (what point would there be?)

Funny, nobody said that about the two posts about reaching $1000 that made the front page with hundreds of upvotes
@_date: 2014-01-12 11:05:26


Exactly. They stole those millions from other people who invested, most of whom will never get back what they put in.
Simple math: If 1000 people invest $1000 into Bitcoin, and an early adopter withdraws $1 million (which he paid peanuts for), what's left to be spread amongst the remaining 1000 people when they go to cash out themselves? 
[Of course they can continue the process by finding new buyers]( but you always run into a brick wall eventually: There are a finite number of people; of buyers, and so the charade has to end sometime, leaving those [left holding the bag](

Make it the average of all exchanges: 
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:00:11


Well that would just lower the hash rate significantly. Even 50% constant utilization might be a bit much for some PCs with poor ventilation/dust buildup (especially laptops!)
It also doesn't get around the issues of degraded hardware and electricity usage, and possibly also unwanted heat production


Well a HD7970, which is quite a high-end GPU gets ~700KH/s at stock with the right settings.
So even if you had 100,000 HD7970s running, it would be 70GH/s.
I don't follow the mining hardware very much, but one I regularly hear of is the KnC Neptune Miner, which is about to be released and a single one will do 3000GH/s.
The total network hashing power is ~13,000,000GH/s
So obviously it's no contest, even with high-end GPUs.
With average hardware (i.e. CPUs, low-end GPUs), the overall figure is going to be far less, perhaps 1-10GH/s?
EDIT: I did a calculation, and currently to boost the network hashing power by 3%, you would need exactly 556,000 computers each running a HD7970
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:16:22


I can show you where I got this data (from a thread post in this very subreddit a bit over a month ago by another user), and I can also probably prove his claim using the data. The data comes directly from the blockchain.
As shown in my post, the first 2269 addresses hold an absolute bare minimum of 30% of all Bitcoins, and this doesn't take into account proper distribution or the full 10,000 addresses, so it appears lines up with the data based on a quick comparison.
Just ask and I will calculate it properly and show you my sources/proof
Unlike you shill, I don't lie.

This is like leaving a young child by a swimming pool unattended and saying 'Don't go in the pool Timmy!'
Bitcoin is not just a 'risky business', it is a scam in which most investors are guaranteed to lose their money. It is a pyramid scheme, and it's just a matter of simple mathematics that a few people who paid peanuts into it will get a large slice of the pie, leaving the large remainder of investors with crumbs to squabble over.
So it's also disingenuous to say 'don't invest what you cannot afford to lose' - because we're talking about gambling here, not investing; the odds are stacked firmly against you from the start, and nobody should 'invest' in that - not even what they 'can' lose (if there is such a thing).
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:39:48


Historical data
Doesn't always work, but it gives you a rough idea
Fundamentals are more important, but in a highly speculative asset, technical analysis is pretty much all you have go by
TA has no predictive power in and of itself, a skeptic might argue, but it does when others also trade based on it. For instance if most traders believe in TA, and they see the price hasn't broken a 'support level', they're not going to sell yet are they - thus fulfilling the prophecy of a support level all by themselves.
I estimate the potential market to be small, because even I find Bitcoin complex and cumbersome to use. Not just to use, but also to securely store. There may be ways of changing aspects of this, but I don't see how you can fully achieve that without sacrificing a lot of the touted benefits of Bitcoin - i.e. avoiding counterparty risk

Repost in case description is also [removed]:
I had two threads unlisted and [removed], but now my comments on posts are also being deleted, as evidenced [here](
The comment is removed, but I can still see it (no one else can). Here is the comment I made in full:
**Bitcoin is a cult, and the people here are its followers**
"[Maybe attacking the mods like you've been attacking the rest of this subreddit with purely negative comments isn't going to get you what you want. You have no sympathy from me. Try some tact.](
This is the response I got from one of the users here when I pointed out that my posts are being censored (unlisted and [removed] by mods) simply because they express a negative opinion. It is a response that is not uncommon to come across on here.
It demonstrates that at least a substantial number of the people here believe the moderators are beyond criticism; beyond responsibility; and indeed, have the right to act however they please, even if it is the contrary to the set of rules they themselves set out.
Bitcoin strikes me as cult-like. Curious, I decided to lookup 'how to identify a cult'. From the first result, I got this checklist:
* The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader and (whether he is alive or dead) regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law.
* Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
* The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s) and members
* The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.
* The leader is not accountable to any authorities
* The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary.
* The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members. 
* The group is preoccupied with making money.
* The most loyal members (the “true believers”) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group.
How many points on this checklist do you think the 'community' of fulfils?
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:48:57
This comment is really revealing in regards to how deluded the Bitcoin advocate is
"If you criticize or oppose Bitcoin, you must be a paid shill"
Well I've stated my motivations here before, on multiple occasions.
I'll repeat it briefly for those who have not seen or read my previous posts: 
To begin with, Bitcoin is hopelessly flawed. Its protocol has promise, but the currency itself, in it's present form, is unsustainable and a train wreck waiting to happen. We are already seeing this now with subjection to regulation, lack of anonymity, fraud and theft due to centralized shady exchanges which users have no choice but to use, the threat of a 51% attack, and so on. 
But that's only my reasoning for why I don't believe in Bitcoin. Here is my motivation for acting against it: There are people whose livelihoods will inevitably be destroyed by Bitcoin. There is no doubt about it, because the damage has already been done. 
When people started cashing out for houses and Lamborghinis, that's when someone else (perhaps a future investor) just lost their retirement savings that they foolishly (or unwittingly) put into Bitcoin.
This is why suicide line information was posted. Like it was in April, if you've forgotten. Relationships with friends, family and partners will either go through tough times or will be destroyed. I doubt many of you can even imagine the shame; the guilt; the absolute numbness and gut-wrenching fear the victims of this bubble are going to experience. And there will be more victims than winners; *many* more. I have explained the simple mathematics behind this before, but to state briefly, if one 'winner' withdraws $1 million, and 1000 people invested $1000 each, what's left for the remaining 1000 people in the end?
I could go on, and perhaps tell you some horror stories from the last bubble, but I won't go on. Because enough is enough, and this bubble needs to end, and I'm glad it stopped growing at $1242 and is now slowly bursting as we speak.

No it's not
If he's such a huge Bitcoin fan, why doesn't he hold on to the Bitcoin instead of exchanging it for fiat within a split second?


[citation needed]
Transaction volume has nothing do with price discovery. Are you possibly thinking of exchange volume?
The problem is that it is the speculation that is causing the extreme volatility. We already know what it's true price is - the true price is the cost to mine it, which is a lot lower than the current price, and can theoretically drop to near zero due to difficulty re-targeting of blocks.
Another thing is that volatility is increasing over time, not decreasing. Compare the period of 2012-2013 to 2013-2014 for example.


Irrelevant and disingenuous to say the least, because the world population does not use Bitcoin. 
Only ~1.8 million Bitcoin addresses have 2 satoshi or more, which means that only about 1 hundredth of a percent of the world's population use Bitcoin in the first place, and that's being unrealistically optimistic.


Without checking the precise figures, I'd guess that about 1-2% of the total M3 (broadest) money supply is spent by consumers for Christmas in Western countries.

This is the state of Bitcoin
This is the best we've got folks
MtGox has caused two major Bitcoin market crashes (the hack in June 2011, and the suspension of trading in April 2013).
People have been saying since *2011* that MtGox is going to be replaced. Well, over 3 years later and it's still the most dominant Western exchange, and it's still fucked up as hell.
And this is the place people take their prices from when say we hear 'Bitcoin just reached $1000!!!' LOL!
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:16:25
Some of the people here may be genuinely confused about why despite all the positive news, Bitcoin is falling in value
Let me explain this to you: People did not invest in Bitcoin because they believe in the fundamentals of it; they invested because they want to make a lot of money.
People have stopped investing in Bitcoin because the price has stopped rising, and has been in a downtrend and has not gone above the $1242 high. This is a self-perpetuating cycle: Less investment = Lower price = Even less investment = Even lower price, and so on.
This is why volumes are so low, and why the number of people visiting has almost halved.
Don't you see? The positive news doesn't affect the price, because the majority of the potential investors don't care about the fundamentals - they only care about whether the price is rising or not, because they're speculating/gambling, *not* actually investing.
Will the price rise above $1242 anytime soon? No, because it mathematically can't. Unless people lose their minds completely. Let me explain: There are many people who bought at $1000, $1100, $1200, etc. who are holding on to losses and are emotionally willing to sell - but only once they can break even (or come close to it). This is why volumes are so low, and more significantly it's why any move up is always smashed down when it hits a key level of support/resistence - because there are a lot of people who bought at this levels and sell whenever the price comes close to it. The buyers are already nervous and heistant, so the number of sellers are going to outweigh the number of buyers every time. This is why the price will never break through $1242, until it goes back down to $200 or less where the speculation started, and then it may (or may not) start rising again.
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:28:49
There have only been three or four such stories
Perhaps a dozen tops.
If these people started cashing out en masse, then they wouldn't be millionaires - as they would flood the market and drive the price down
That's why hardly anyone is going to win out of this bubble, for if a thousand people invest $1000 each which is all given to the benefit of one early adopter to become a millionaire, what are the thousand remaining people left with? Answer: Zero.

@_date: 2014-01-12 16:00:12


Yes, because the price has not invalidated the downtrend.
These brief surges are just short-term noise in a longer-term downtrend.
You see the same could have been said when it reached $1240 after going down to ~$840 (that is the 'buying opportunity' of $900 I reference in my comment). But what happened after it reached $1240? It crashed once again - this time to even more severe level of $576.
Then from $576 it went back up to $1068 again. OMG!!! 86% increase!!, you say. But what happened then? An even more severe crash yet again, down to $455.
And so you see where this is going..
My prediction, which I've regularly specified and have always maintained, is that the price will reach $200 before it ever reaches $1242 again.
Some of the shills here like to make out that that prediction is now being invalidated by going back into the four digits territory (now back down into 3 digits you'll note), but what they either do not know or deliberately leave out is that I first made that prediction [when the price was at ~$1030](

What you don't realize, or do realize and are simply morally reprehensible, is that that money has to come from somewhere; from someone. Every time some guy buys a house or Lamborghini with his Bitcoin he mined back in 2010, that's someones retirement savings that just got fleeced.
Bitcoin is a complete failure. It does not function even as a viable medium of exchange, due to the extreme volatility and speculation.

On the contrary, I do not believe people should never take risks. I believe people should take calculated risks that are in their favor. Bitcoin is not one such favor to take. It is in a speculative bubble and is inherently flawed diminishing whatever minute intrinsic value it had to begin with. Most of the people who 'invest' (read: gamble) now, or have invested in the past three months or so, are going to get burned.
Being burned is actually quite a rewarding experience. It teaches you about investing properly. It is a harsh but worthwhile experience. Not for those about to retire though; it is not worthwhile for them to lose their retirement nestegg to some neckbeard, in order for said neckbeard to buy a Lamborghini.

**Bitcoin is a cult, and the people here are its followers**
"[Maybe attacking the mods like you've been attacking the rest of this subreddit with purely negative comments isn't going to get you what you want. You have no sympathy from me. Try some tact.](
This is the response I got from one of the users here when I pointed out that my posts are being censored (unlisted and [removed] by mods) simply because they express a negative opinion. It is a response that is not uncommon to come across on here.
It demonstrates that at least a substantial number of the people here believe the moderators are beyond criticism; beyond responsibility; and indeed, have the right to act however they please, even if it is the contrary to the set of rules they themselves set out.
Bitcoin strikes me as cult-like. Curious, I decided to lookup 'how to identify a cult'. From the first result, I got this checklist:
* The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader and (whether he is alive or dead) regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law.
* Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
* The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s) and members
* The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.
* The leader is not accountable to any authorities
* The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary.
* The group is preoccupied with bringing in new members. 
* The group is preoccupied with making money.
* The most loyal members (the “true believers”) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group.
How many points on this checklist do you think the 'community' of fulfils?
**ADDED NOTE**: After I posted the above comment in a thread, it was deleted by the mods without warning, as evidenced [here]( Don't allow this outrageous censorship to continue, act against it. At the very least, talk about it.

Based on recent news regarding Singapore, this seems deliberately deceptive, unless Singapore have since changed their tune (which I highly doubt)
Singapore declared that Bitcoin is NOT a currency, but will instead be treated as a commodity, which is bad - because not only does it mean it cannot be treated as a currency by reporting businesses/individuals, it also means that Bitcoins can be taxed whenever at the any stage in the transaction process. It could easily kill Bitcoin use in Singapore, just as VAT has done to silver in Europe.

Some of the people here may be genuinely confused about why despite all the positive news, Bitcoin is falling in value
Let me explain this to you: People did not invest in Bitcoin because they believe in the fundamentals of it; they invested because they want to make a lot of money.
People have stopped investing in Bitcoin because the price has stopped rising, and has been in a downtrend and has not gone above the $1242 high. This is a self-perpetuating cycle: Less investment = Lower price = Even less investment = Even lower price, and so on.
This is why volumes are so low, and why the number of people visiting has almost halved.
Don't you see? The positive news doesn't affect the price, because the majority of the potential investors don't care about the fundamentals - they only care about whether the price is rising or not, because they're speculating/gambling, *not* actually investing.
Will the price rise above $1242 anytime soon? No, because it mathematically can't. Unless people lose their minds completely. Let me explain: There are many people who bought at $1000, $1100, $1200, etc. who are holding on to losses and are emotionally willing to sell - but only once they can break even (or come close to it). This is why volumes are so low, and more significantly it's why any move up is always smashed down when it hits a key level of support/resistance - because there are a lot of people who bought at this levels and sell whenever the price comes close to it. The buyers are already nervous and hesitant, so the number of sellers are going to outweigh the number of buyers every time. This is why the price will never break through $1242, until it goes back down to $200 or less where the speculation started, and then it may (or may not) start rising again.

@_date: 2014-01-14 19:17:35
Not this time, because of this not-so-small cavaet: There are a finite number of buyers
The market available to Bitcoin has been almost entirely saturated.
For it to do the same again, it would need to reach ~$5780, which won't happen due to the diminishing number of potential buyers left.
This is reflected in past increases:
The bubble of $1.10 to the bubble of $31.91 = 29x increase
The bubble of $31.91 to the bubble of $266 = 8.33x increase
The bubble of $266 to the bubble of $1242 = 4.66x increase
Going by the above, the next bubble is estimated as follows:
The bubble of $1242 to the bubble of ~$3974 (3.2x increase)
The time span would also be much closer to 2 years than 1 year
In reality though, the fundamentals are destroying whatever value Bitcoin had. It could go to zero in a years time, especially if a better alternative cryptocurrency comes along (after all, what's to prevent it, Bitcoin has no unique non-replicable feature)

The post has been censored by mods, so I'll repost it here:
A few minutes ago I checked the price of Bitcoin again, and found it relatively unchanged at $922. It's been hovering around that area for about a day now, which is remarkably stable, for Bitcoin at least.
This reminded me of the people here who say 'volatility is decreasing'. Then as I pondered it for a few more seconds, I realized that this stabilized price is also putting a damper on speculative interest, and this made me think of the people here who predict '[Bitcoin is going to far exceed $10,000 by the end of 2014!!!!]( and such. Let alone [those here who should seek psychiatric help](
Put two and two together, and you come up with a delicious irony: The people who say volatility is decreasing are the same people who say Bitcoin is going to continue to reach dizzying heights in a short space of time.
Just goes to show that the people here don't actually believe in what they preach. They *know* it's a speculative bubble, but they insist that volatility is decreasing and Bitcoin is at it's fair value (or not even high enough yet!). And we know in our heart of hearts why they say this: They say it either to convince themselves of the wisdom of their 'investment' in Bitcoin - or worse; to convince others to invest for selfish reasons that should be only too obvious.

There are a lot of shills who are getting emotional about the probable demise of Bitcoin due to an impending 51% attack.


















What these shills don't realize is that trying to convince somebody not to do something because they have an opportunity to in a market, is not just laughably stupid and futile, but also misplaced.
The blame should be on the protocol for allowing this to happen, not on the people who utilize a route the protocol allows. This is why Bitcoin must be rigorously foolproof. Sad to say, it is not, and that is why it will meet it's demise sooner or later.
When will these shills begin to realize that their screaming and crying isn't going to help their plight; it fact, it cheapens Bitcoin, because it shows that its userbase is mostly comprised of a bunch of amateur childlike individuals.

In two senses I agree: Cryptocurrencies are immature, and what we are currently experiencing is akin to the Dot-com bubble of the mid to late 90s.


Bitcoin can never be stable because it is inherently flawed, and those flaws cannot be fixed (if it's even possible) without starting afresh with a new, separate cryptocurrency that is completely unlike Bitcoin as it is now.


That's only 124 Bitcoins, which is peanuts. 780 orders.. there are 94K Reddit members subscribed to But the most important thing to point out I think is that people only bought from Overstock, it seemed, to show their support. 
Go and read the top comments in the Overstock threads - I saw these kinds of comments being posted (with an air of desperation I might add), along the lines of 'Seriously guys, buy something from Overstock to show your support!'.
In other words, it's tin headed value; it's a tokenistic gesture. The same happened with Bitpay during their 'Black Friday' event. I can't remember what the average daily volume was over their tens of thousands of merchants was, but it was truly a pittance. Nobody uses Bitcoin as an actual currency in any significant amount aside from these one-day opportunities to collectively generate positive media attention and pump up the price of Bitcoin.

Sure, they'll get something out of it, but for most of them it won't be much.
Take the past two Bitcoin bubbles for instance: From $31.91 down to ~$4 (87% loss), $266 to ~$50 (81% loss). These are not insignificant losses we're talking about here. And to jsut get your money back you'll probably have to wait months, or even *years* (as with the 2011 $31.91 bubble)
Further, this is exacerbated by the exit of capital on the way down. Because the people aren't just exiting at the very top - they are exiting at $1100, $1000, etc. which are all values well above the true value. In the end, you'll find that 80% of people will get less than $300/BTC, and most of that 80% will get $200/BTC or less.


If Bitcoin does make new highs, it's doubtful it will occur in 2014. This is because as I said, these bubbles take months or even years to fully unravel.
Another reason why it might be different the next time round is that Bitcoin is beginning to saturate the available market. It's hard to see Bitcoin becoming simplified, or more importantly stable enough, to appeal to the ordinary person. Bitcoin is already having mainstream reach through television, newspapers, etc. so whatever future price there is, it's not going to be comparable to what we saw before.
There are also other matters to take into account: 
Altcoins are growing exponentially, all mostly within the past two months or so, and will likely start drawing away from Bitcoin's available market. 
There's also government regulation, which is just now beginning to make its mark before it's felt. Transaction fees would also be quite high if the price increase 5x over the past peak to $6K say (the minimum fee would be ~$0.60 or something like that).
Long-term (I'm talking probably a few years away), Bitcoin is going to zero. A replacement will come along which emulates Bitcoin's features, only better, and possibly sad to say may be 'legitimatized' (and not in a good way) before we see a truly viable 'Libertarian' alternative you might say.

No, but that's someone's retirement savings you're robbing them of
You think they're going to get it back? You only get out what you put in, and there's a finite amount of buyers in the world.
Once you reach the last buyer, that ~$40,000 you took out won't be able to be replaced, and when the person you stole it from goes to cash out, he'll find there's no money left in the pot for him.

Bitcoin is not a store of value, but a medium of exchange (which it fails, due to the extreme volatility).
If people hoard Bitcoins it will only drive up the price due to having more demand than supply; meaning volatility will be even higher not just due to surplus demand, but also low trading volume.
It would also be artificial pumping of the price that would be bound to collapse sooner or later, since Bitcoin is not actually a store of value, and so encouraging people with 'HOLD SPARTANS is only going to emotionally convince them for a brief while - it is not rationally convincing.

Notice how the price is propped up by this support. This type of trendline helps traders to anticipate the point at which a stock's price will begin moving upwards again."

The reality is that Bitcoin is not a store of value. It has no value other than as a medium of exchange. Even the Bitcoin FAQ says this for fuck's sake:
"It is true that bitcoins have no intrinsic value, in the numismatic sense, in other words, value in any realm outside of being used as a medium of exchange."


No they're not. Miners will receive transaction fees as rewards for mining. If they stop mining, the whole Bitcoin system will literally stop working.
Do you even understand the basics of how Bitcoin works?
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:32:37
The wastefulness of expenditure in mining gold is actually as an argument for Bitcoin because Bitcoin wastes less. Running computers to mine Bitcoins uses less resources than running a gold-mining operation. So why not go one step further, and say that we should not waste any resources at all, or even make more *positive* use of resources?
Just the first thing that came to my mind, but imagine if instead of solving random computational problems, why not dedicate all that computational power to solving real-world problems like what Rosetta does.
Or what about other types of 'practical' earning, such as doing a small job for some currency. This is how LETS works, which has been around for decades.
Although gold is valued as a medium of exchange, you need to also take into account that it has an intrinsic value. It has many other uses, whereas Bitcoin does not. You seem to misunderstand 'intrinsic value' in this regard - you interpret to mean what people think of it; speculative value. That is not what I use the term to mean at least.

That's what the people who bought in at $20 in 2011 said after the crash from $32.
They didn't see $20 again for two years, and of those who didn't give up and sell out during that time, most of them probably cashed out at $20-$40 when it started rising again.
@_date: 2013-12-15 04:32:23


[citation needed]
If you're going to claim that production costs are somehow 'contained in the item itself', then practically everything has intrinsic value and the term becomes diluted and meaningless.
When people say 'gold has intrinsic value', they mean something much more specific, which Bitcoin or aluminum does not have, and you very well know that. In other words, you're being intentionally disingenuous and dishonest.
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:41:02
I like how the word 'again' is used - because no one really cares about Bitcoin anymore, not even if the news is positive (except for the people currently invested in Bitcoin of course).
All people care about is whether they can make money out of it or not, and seeing as the price has been in a downtrend for the past fortnight, nobody is getting excited by it anymore because they realize/worry the good times are over.
It's kind of like a drug - the first hit is the best, but then you get diminishing returns. Eventually, not even a high dosage of the good stuff is enough to provoke a response - it only satisfies, temporarily. 
When the shots become unavailable or run out, that's when the real trouble begins and things become dire/insane (like Bitcoin's price, soon to come). They even call it a 'crash'!

If you'd read the 'last link' I mentioned, you would have found that I did exactly that: I provided precise figures.
I'll quote, since you're too butthurt to look outside your own rationalizations:
"We are in the middle of a dead cat bounce. Bitcoin has been off it's record high for several days now, and it's still down at $1137.
Volumes are decreasing as those bought in at ~$1200 wait for the price to go up to sell out, whilst buyers adopt a wait &amp; see pose until the price beats the previous high.
The end result is that those who bought at higher levels get nervous and settle for less when it starts getting close to the ~$1200 mark. The sudden wave of selling will be too much for the few buyers willing to buy, and then the price will start crashing down."
This is pretty much exactly what happened. I deliberately used the tilde, because no one can predict exactly what the top of the dead cat bounce will be - but one thing is for sure, and that is that the dead cat bounce will never exceed the previous high, which was $1242. I said this in [another post]( at about the same time:
"It will never again reach the high of $1242"
That was a pretty strong claim to make, when the price was at around ~$1200 at the time!

The only 'good' regulation in my view, is that which is built into the system itself.
Unfortunately, Bitcoin does not have adequate regulation built into it as a protocol.
Asking for or allowing, or even just leaving open the possibility of, external regulation, in my view means death for the system. Especially for Bitcoin, since lack of regulation is one of it's main purported positives.
The best form of regulation is to create a system which automatically discourages speculation say, or the use of centrally-controlled external exchanges which open up the user to fraud and personal identification.

Anyone with a sound mind would know that saying 'Bitcoin can never fall, it's going to $1 quadtrillion++++. BUY NOW BEFORE ITS TOO LATE YOU WILL BE BILLIONAIRE IN 24 HOURS' is a warning in the form of a joke (use of exaggeration - same with 'selling for $25, $30, $40'). 
Also the 'Please hurry.' post, where a speculator posted on Bitcointalk, desperately trying to get out, but it was too late - another piece of humor (though real in this case), meant to serve as a warning to other speculators at the time.
But they didn't listen. Just like you people won't today. The goyim never learn. But don't worry, I'll probably be around to deride and mock you fools during the next bubble too - if the currency isn't dead by then.

No, or at least I doubt that would be the case, because it takes the previous data points and bases the rise in price on that - those previous data points have whatever exponential growth you suggest there to be built into them.
Now I suspect that wouldn't include *future* exponential growth, so the $366 by June 2014 figure may be in error if the price grows even faster than has recently been growing (I find that unlikely personally, seeing as it's coming off a bubble) - however this does not effect the present mean (i.e. what we can expect in the very short-term, such as in the next few weeks), which is $190.
Also an interesting point is that if this exponential growth idea were real, then it would mean that interest would finally reach it's peak (say the entire available world population) within a few months probably - because with exponentiation, the time between time periods has to grow shorter and shorter.. i.e. time between the previous two bubbles was 2 years, then 8 months between this one and the past one - which would make the next what? Perhaps 3 months? And the next one a few weeks.. then a few days.. do you see where this is going? It means we will reach peak interest in a few months by this logic!

The majority of people invested in Bitcoin at the moment *are* there to ride on the wave up and intend to cash out back into fiat when they've made their fortune.
Only a minority of Bitcoin users 'believe' in the currency itself, and even a significant number of these people I daresay will be tempted to cash out (if only to buy back in at a lower price later).
Bitcoin's value as a medium of exchange (even if it is viable) isn't being 'ignored' or 'overlooked', it's value is simply a lot lower than what it is currently priced at in fiat. It's 'true' value is where it was before the speculation began - which I put at the $20-$30 mark (perhaps a little higher due to increased mining difficulty since then)
It's also worth pointing out that between can have a value of zero in fiat. If what you say is true, and we are left with a closed system of people who simply trade Bitcoins for Bitcoins and not for fiat, then it follows that the fiat market price for Bitcoin is zero, because there are no trades.

Not more vulnerable since then, it's always been this vulnerable. I guess you could pinpoint it at when the first exchange started up, or when Bitcoins started being traded for dollars rather than items.
Though this was inevitable, because the Bitcoin 'system' as I will call it, leaves it open to happening. And as we can see now, it's becoming increasingly difficult to create/'mine' your own Bitcoins - you are essentially forced to buy them with no other option; forced to use an exchange.
IMO, the only kind of cryptocurrency that I see as possibly having long-term success is one in which the user is forced to generate their own value (or is granted a starting value equal to all others) and not simply be able to buy their way into it. Something similar to how LETS works I guess you could say.

@_date: 2013-12-02 19:07:29
It's nothing personal, but I don't like the way Bitcoin is going.
In the original whitepaper on Bitcoin there's a section on privacy, and in that section it describes how Bitcoin gets rid of the need to rely upon trusted third parties in transactions. With Bitcoin, transactions are completely separated from personal identity.
So having a kind of web-of-trust system using personal information that is handed over to a trusted third party is defeating the original point of Bitcoin. 
At least that's my opinion, but seeing the number of people that have been willing to hand over their personal information and documents to third-party exchanges, I can't say my opinion is any longer one of the majority..
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:36:45

Bitcoin is currently 32% off it's high of $1242 reached two weeks ago.

@_date: 2013-12-14 06:29:45
You are operating on a misunderstanding of how markets fundamentally work
At $947/BTC and total exchange volume today of ~85,000 BTC, that means we can expect there to be (at best) $80 million of capital ready to be spent (price x volume).
Now if the FBI comes along and dumps 170,000 BTC, making the total supply 255,000 BTC, then either the price must come down by two thirds, or capital investment has to increase by an additional 200% in a single day.
Do you see that no one 'buys them for hundreds of millions, then dumps them at significant losses'? The price simply comes down BEFORE the transaction takes place. Of course, there will be a few trades at high prices until supply is realized (i.e. wiping out existing buy orders), but this number will be very few, and what will happen is that there will be a flash crash.

@_date: 2013-12-14 06:16:33
Even if they sell them gradually, that would still depress the price significantly.
All you would do is avoid the effects of market panic
You'd still be increasing the supply by an amount each time you sell that would likely exceed new demand.
Besides, governments tend to sell in large lots without consideration for price. Look at how gold was sold off by some nations in the early 2000s for example.
Gold at least was on the radar - Bitcoin though is largely regarded as a gimmick/fad, and $160 million is a pitence to the US government - why would it care about getting top dollar, or avoiding a Bitcoin market crash? (especially when you could argue that Bitcoin is against it's best interests)
This is probably also a necessary requirement, due to red tape (can you imagine getting permission each time to do hourly sales of 10BTC over 2 years for example?)

Investing is always a risk, but not a straight gamble.
I might invest in silver for instance because I believe it has future utility and limited supply that will drive it's value up.
One might invest in Bitcoin because they think it is a foolproof currency that will be widely adopted in the future, and that it's better to be an early adopter than a late one.
Gambling on the other hand, 'speculation', is when you put 'invest' in silver or Bitcoin because you think/hope the price will go up in the future - regardless of the fundamental actual value.

Many of my posts have been humorous
Take the first posts I made 8 months ago - posting 'SELLING MY BITCOINS FOR $30 PLEASE BUY' or whatever, when the price was at ~$60-$100.
Or comments [like this one]( which I hope nobody will take for anything other than a joke.
Or how about [this post]( (and my comment) that I made a bit over three weeks ago?
Whilst I am making jokes and being exaggerated in many of my posts, I have been expressing my genuine opinions as well, [in significant detail in most cases.](
My goal is two-fold - to entertain myself, and hopefully save some of the people from investing in this bubble. 
What was a catalyst for the latter was reading a post in here about some guys in his 50s planning to invest his retirement savings in Bitcoin whilst it was at ~$700 or so - plus I know from experience how it feels to be one of the losers in a bubble.


You assume I am an American, which I am not. Who knows, you might have fought *against* me, eh?
It's also quite pompous to state that you've 'fought for' someone in my opinion. Maybe you genuinely did, but I suspect that in most cases people do things for selfish motivations, or perhaps an abstract concept such as 'liberty' - but not to defend what they openly hate, that would be disingenuous to claim.

I can't help it if you aren't the brightest bulb in the pack bro
Both Bitcoin and DogeCoin are too volatile, but of *whatever* advantages you might say Bitcoin has, they are to be found in DogeCoin as well 


Incorrect. The exchanges are centralized, and Bitcoin as a protocol is now reliant upon them. You can no longer get Bitcoins by mining, unless you have tens of thousands of dollars to spare, and even then you have to take a risk by buying from a centralized and shady entity such as Butterfly Labs (we all know how it went with those guys) to get an ASIC miner.


This is a disadvantage rather than an advantage. You can see the affects of a set small inflation rate right now, with volatility going off the charts. In the future when all coins are mined, this will turn into deflation which will be even worse - because if a coin I bought today is going to worth more tomorrow, why spend it today? It prevents the Bitcoin economy from growing, making Bitcoin worthless - because then, what's the point of it?


An advantage, however a minor one. US fiat for example is divisible to 1 cent, and I don't know of any items that would cost that amount or less.
If necessary, fiat denominations can simply be changed, at a minor cost.


An advantage, however fiat is already instantaneous for most transactions, even transactions involving FX.


Electronic fiat is about as difficult to counterfeit

You should have read onto the next sentence, as it explains that the protocol is now tied to exchanges. It is no longer feasible to mine Bitcoin, unless you can make a $10K+ investment.
The only way to get Bitcoins is through exchanges (don't even mention localbitmugging.com). Therefore the exchanges have essentially become a part of the protocol.

Not bad for me. But it is going to be bad for perhaps many thousands of people who might lose everything they've invested, some of whom may have invested all the money they have and/or are dependent on for their livelihoods.
Sure, speculation and volatility is going to happen, but places like these should discourage it not only for the good of the currency, but for the good of the users. It harms both the currency and the users to have excessive speculation and volatility. Instead of warning against speculation, against dumping your life savings in Bitcoin at $1000 because it 'corrected' at $914, we have people here saying that Bitcoin is not in a bubble of any kind!
'Correction' and 'market crash' are not mutually exclusive. In fact, I daresay you *cannot* have a correction without a market crash.
Going from $1073 to $914 is not a correction. That is merely volitility; 'short-term movement'; 'noise', whatever you like to call it. The term 'correction' however has a very precise definition, and that definition is a return to the price that is 'correct' - that is, the price at which unjustified speculation began, the actual fundamental value of what's being traded.

My prediction was, if you'd comprehended it, that Bitcoin would reach $30-$200 before ever returning to $1242 or above.
So far, it appears you are on the wrong side!
I've always said to expect a few bumps on the way down - no bubble resolves in a purely linear fashion. What matters is that the highs are lower than the previous highs, which means it's in a strong downtrend.

@_date: 2013-12-26 19:56:02
Which processor do you suggest for someone who resides outside of the US?
My requirements are: A minimum balance of $100 to withdraw (preferably lower), and not run by a known scammer/con-artist/fraud, and will actually setup my account and allow me to use the service within a reasonable timeframe (1 week is reasonable, 2 weeks is more than sufficient)
I think you need to pull your head out of the sand and wake up to the fact that merchant adoption is very small, and one of the reasons is that there are simply no safe options to accept Bitcoin outside of the USA. 
As mentioned, I asked on here before what services are available to me. Coinjar was the only suggestion, and it got plenty of upvotes. So I tried it, and not only is it run by a known crook, but it doesn't even permit me to use it!

No, but anyone looking at the chart right now and realizing that we're just coming off a speculative bubble can clearly see that it's better to sell now at ~$600 and buy in later if necessary, rather than wait for it to go to $200 or less and then sell/hold

I have taken a glance at Freicoin before, but I was skeptical to say the least about 80% of the proceeds going to the Freicoins Foundation.
I see there is a historical thread about a fork to get rid of this. I will do some more investigation into this.
In LETS, credits have no need to 'adjust'. 1 credit always equals 1 hour of work-time. This is how you should be thinking about a stable conception of currency. It could possibly work with that which varies, but the point is to cut out fiat from the equation and simply make it the cryptocurrency a direct measure of value.
Repeatedly saying 'cryptocurrencies simply aren't for you' doesn't make it any more true. If you are willfully ignorant of Bitcoin's flaws, then perhaps that statement is true in your case. 
Some of us actually want a currency that is stable, that is anonymous yet transparent, that is unregulated, that is secure, and that intends to be used as a system-in-itself from the start and not be tied to other flawed currencies such as fiat to drag it down. Bitcoin does not offer this.

Protip: If you try and exchange your Bitcoins for fiat, you *will* get caught out if you don't pay taxes on it
Even if you sell face-to-face in an unrecorded transaction, you'll have to explain where that money has come from later if it's any substantial amount that suddenly comes into the 'system' (and that could land you into bigger hot water than you deserve, because they'll likely suspect you're getting that money from committing more serious crimes, and you have to prove otherwise)
You have to laugh at the circlejerk here. Everyday the people in here pat themselves on the back and say 'we're all gonna make it brah'.
The reality of the situation is that nations, businesses, and even normal individuals aren't using it as a currency as many here like to believe (as they repost positive videos from Bill Shill, and upvote stories about Ferraris for sale for Bitcoins) - rather they are treating it as what it is currently is, a speculative gamble. Most businesses want nothing to do with it due to the volatility, individuals want to get in and then get out to make a quick buck, financial institutions want to make the smart money by skimming off the throughput on exchanges, and nations know it's not a threat to their own currency but want to regulate so that nothing disruptive occurs (i.e. theft, tax evasion, fraud)

How does more trade mean less volatility?
The volatility isn't caused by lack of trade. It's being caused by the rate of demand increasing faster than the rate of inflation, and that isn't going to change anytime soon.
Then we have a deflationary spiral to look forward to, which means more volatility.

If you don't, then it appears the problem you have with my post is not that it is factually incorrect, but that you find it disagreeable for other reasons - either you are merely offended by my choice of wording, or perhaps you do not want others to see it because it will discourage them from buying Bitcoin in light of the facts (your initial reply is suggestive of the latter)

You'll find I made no prediction of a crash before that (except back in April of course, and you know what happened then)
If I was merely spamming predictions, you would expect me to say the bubble had popped when it went to $900 and then crashed to $450, yet I didn't say a word - because I knew that that was not the peak of the bubble.
I predicted the peak of the bubble, and the subsequent dead cat bounce, only once - and I got it correct. All of my predictions have been correct, albeit with one or two small inaccuracies (i.e. saying the dead cat bounce would reach '~$1200' rather than the $1240 it actually reached.

Stop attacking strawmen


It's not the number that's important, rather how much of the history of the price it covers. So long as the fundamentals do not change, then it has a predictive ability in that it measures the long-term mean of the price - and thus what price we can expect it to go to and hang around in the near future.


You're being vague here. Do you mean that data points shouldn't be used that fall outside of a certain deviation? Or do you mean something else? Explain


That's example of the fundamentals changing, and if you used say 100 years of data, you would find that the overall mean trend is upwards.
Bitcoin doesn't have much data to work with, but assuming the fundamentals stay the same, then that is what should expect the mean price to be in the near future.

I referred to it again in an earlier post in this thread:
"Those purely inside the closed system are not effected by this volatility, however they do face the uncertainty of the future of the currency by the jeopardized uptake (if confidence is lost and no one uses it, it becomes worthless). This is what Satoshi meant when he said 'the heat will destroy us' - a significant amount of bad publicity (which I will suggest to you, could include multiple bubble flash-crashes) could diminish the confidence in the currency which is crucial to it's uptake and thus long-term success."

The reason why women and old people won't typically use Bitcoin is two-fold: Bitcoin is non-intuitive and it has Libertarian/Similar ideology as the primary motivation for it's use/adoption.
Women, on average, don't like to rock the boat socially. They aren't interested in 'sticking it to the man', or other anarchist/libertarian ideals that males are attracted to. Thus they don't have a need for Bitcoin in the first place - they will prefer convenience over safeguarding their money. How often do you see or hear of a female who invests in gold, compared to a male?
Old people, and people in general, are too dumb or unwilling and set in their ways to learn about complicated non-intuitive things. Even I find Bitcoin pretty perplexing and cumbersome. They just want something that is convenient and simple to use, like Apple products. You might suggest that Bitcoin will be simplified and streamlined for adoption, but it's hard to see this happening without handing over your authority to trusted 3rd party entities - which kind of defeats the whole point.
A lot of people here dream that Bitcoin is going to spark some kind of ideological revolution, or that it is the first sign of one. 
They're going to bitterly disappointed in my view - especially if (and it probably will happen), governments and big business start using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoins to their own advantage - leaving the original ideological purpose abandoned from all but the minds of the original users. We are already seeing this begin to happen, with users here actually *welcoming* government regulation of Bitcoin (because regulation = legal, a desirable trade-off in their view).

No, the majority of silver is bought for industrial use
Silver has just come off a speculative bubble that occurred 2.5 years ago. The market is bearish and silver is arguably undervalued.
Those who aren't speculating in silver, but buy it for investment, are using it as a hedge against the inflationary properties of fiat.
There is however a non-speculative reason to believe that the price of silver will go up: Silver has elemental properties that it make it the only suitable choice for many industrial applications. It also has a finite supply in the Earth's crust, and is not efficiently recycled. These factors in mind, the price of silver is likely to rise in the long-term - and not based on mere speculation.


There is a certain cost at which mining silver becomes unprofitable. If the price of silver goes below this cost, then mining supply will dry, creating a price squeeze upward as supply fails to match demand.
Even if no one bought silver, the long-term price would still have to be the price at which it is mined or higher.
Bitcoin on the other hand can be mined at any price, even zero dollars.

Gold is primarily used as a store of value, but it can also be used as a medium of exchange. Silver is preferable due to it's greater abundance and thus lower price, however you can find plenty of historical examples of gold being used a medium of exchange - i.e. sovereigns.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:31:09


Exactly, and more are on their way out
It's not just about the loans - the price of gold is in fact under the average cost of production, and many miners have their cost well above the price (up to ~$1800/oz I believe)
Decrease in supply = price squeeze upwards
Bitcoin on the other hand can go to near zero, since it only costs the amount of electricity and hardware, and if people stop mining it then the difficulty readjusts and decreases automatically

Saying you're going to be a millionaire if you invest in Bitcoin because it's only going up, up and up is a trick.
Bitcoin as it is now, is fraudulent - It's a pyramid scheme.
You have no shame that you are robbing people of their hard earned wealth, thrown away because they got suckered in by a bunch of shills and didn't know any better. 
Their ignorance doesn't change the fact that they probably worked thousands of hours for that money, perhaps producing the food that you eat, just to see it vanish in the blink of an eye and handed over to some gloating 30-year-old neckbeard (someone, by the way, whose advice they trusted) who'll probably lose 50%+ of it to the government through taxes anyway.

Holy shit you shills are fucking determined
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:37:15
Why do you think the price has been going up?
It's because the exchanges aren't letting people sell/withdraw other than in small amounts, and even then it's delayed, causing a price squeeze
It's easy to deposit, because it benefits them, but you can't withdraw because they don't have the liquidity. Do you think they could come up with $50mil if one of the early adopters decided to cash out?

On the contrary, I have saved them from what is to come.
The price will only fall further for those who are currently invested, and popping the bubble early means that less people end up falling victim to this pyramid scheme.

You mistake me as an advocate of Bitcoin. 
I would say I'm an advocate of cryptocurrencies and the potential they have, but not of Bitcoin.
I think Bitcoins will turn out to be a failure in the long run, for many reasons. One of them is that people now have to turn to exchanges to get Bitcoins, rather than being able to produce or earn them. You can hope that people wouldn't intertwine Bitcoin with fiat, but it's better to actually prevent it.

You don't sound like someone who has investing experience.
I say this not to be snide, but because if you were an experienced investor you would know that it is never worthwhile investing in a speculative bubble.
Sure, you might become rich, but it's the same as gambling, and just like gambling, the odds are not in your favor. You not only have to pick precisely the right point to jump out (not too late, not too early), you also have to be an early investor in this case.
I don't think the current level of investment is anywhere near in line with the trade-utility of Bitcoin. I'm sure you know this too, and I find it shameful that you have no qualms about playing Russian roulette with people's money - some of whom have invested even their retirement savings.

$30-$200 is where the speculation began
Long-term, Bitcoin I suspect is going to zero as better alternatives arrive on the scene
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:37:08
Even if Bitcoin does become a success (which I think it won't), it will be the early adopters who benefit the most rather than 'everybody can win'.
This is already the case - someone holding $30 worth of Bitcoins from 2010 now has ~$60,000. Someone who was smart enough to buy the same amount after the crash earlier this year at $60/BTC only has $500.

Gold is currently under the cost of production
Why do you think the gold miner stocks have fallen by up to 90%, whilst gold has only fallen 25%?
Gold was very obviously in a speculative bubble before when it went up to $2,000 - but it was a minor to moderate one, and what we are seeing now is some minor to moderate short-term damage.
Gold has suffered a change in usage - it has not been replaced, and has few possible alternatives (if any), which is why it is still used in say computer chips even at a price of $2000/oz.
Anyone who invested in gold or silver a few years ago is seeing massive gains, even despite the recent bubble crashes.
This is not so much caused by the increased value of these assets - rather, it is the fiat that is decreasing in value in relation to them. Precious metal is more of a store of value than an investment where you expect returns. You can save in precious metals safely, and not have your savings eaten away by inflation.
Bitcoin on the other hand is a wildly speculative asset with no intrinsic value, which makes it possibly the worst 'store of value' one can think of (even fiat at least has the intrinsic value of wood pulp or plastic, or copper-nickel alloy). Someone who invested two weeks ago has now lost well over half of their value.
Acquire gold, discard shitcoins.
BTW keep up the good work with the censorship jewdah
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:52:57
Fact: Most people will lose their money from this bubble
Early adopters paid peanuts to get Bitcoins, and they hold the bulk of them
So say some guy who invested in late 2010 wants to sell his Bitcoin stash for $1 mil - that million has to come from the new buyers. Let's say on average, each buyer 'invests' $1000 into Bitcoin.
So what ends up happening is 1000 new buyers pay for 1 person to get rich. It's a massive transfer of wealth to people who people who don't deserve it (all they did was run a miner program on their computer while they slept), and it leaves no money left for any of those 1000 who then want to sell. That is, unless they can find new buyers - in other words, it's a pyramid scheme, which are always destined to collapse since you always running out of buyers eventually.
So overall, shitcoin is the worst investment - the vast majority of people lose so people can buy [Lamborginis]( or whatever with their cashed out funds, and they're going to lose BIG-TIME.
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:07:32

But we've already established that most Bitcoins are received without involving dollars through mining, or private transactions, or faucets, etc.
Plus I didn't say the kids buy it themselves. I said they use 'mom's money' - in other words, they use mom's details, which many parents allow their kids to do (i.e. online game subscriptions).

@_date: 2013-11-28 00:20:53
It possibly keeps happening again, until either it becomes a stable success or the currency dies out.
But keep in mind that the people who lost in the last bubble probably aren't here this time round to sell (particularly because they got burned and lost their money of course). The same will be the case for the people who lose in this bubble.

Linear regression expresses the 'true' value of the price - essentially, the price it will always return to.
Same with the channel - for instance, with an S.D. of 2, it means that the price will fall within that channel 95% of the time.
It's not for predicting all-time highs and all-time lows - just where we can expect the price to reach at some point, and where it'll probably stay around for most of the time

Care to name 5 gold miners who will continue to operate at under $1000/oz?
On the other hand, how many will continue to mine Bitcoins at $500/BTC? $400? $200? $100?

What are the actual transaction figures in BTC?
Going by the total transaction volume in Bitcoin, it's going to be a drop in the ocean
We are in the middle of a dead cat bounce. Bitcoin has been off it's record high for several days now, and it's still down at $1137.
Volumes are decreasing as those bought in at ~$1200 wait for the price to go up to sell out, whilst buyers adopt a wait &amp; see pose until the price beats the previous high.
The end result is that those who bought at higher levels get nervous and settle for less when it starts getting close to the ~$1200 mark. The sudden wave of selling will be too much for the few buyers willing to buy, and then the price will start crashing down.

“The fact that there are multiple exchanges but only 1723 registered businesses worldwide advertised as using bitcoin (no doubt there are more in reality), suggests there may be something in the idea that there is currently more people buying bitcoin in anticipation of an increase in bitcoin value, rather than buying bitcoin in order to use them as a payment method. That strongly suggests a bubble in the present value of bitcoin.”

A 3000-word opinion piece constitutes a book now?!
Holy shit, I want to get on this gravy train. How much have you been earning from this drivel OP?
You've only been around since October 2012? If I was going to read a book about someone's opinion on Bitcoin, it would be from someone who's been in it since 2010.
You don't even understand what makes gold have a 'transactional value'. It's viability for use as a medium of exchange has nothing to do with being 'nice and heavy' (Do you possibly mean density rather than weight?) or a 'good conductor of electricity'.
Lots of ridiculous (and evasive) straw-man generalizations like 'When people claim Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, what they are
usually trying to say is: "I don't like Bitcoin."'
I say it's an opinion piece, because it's completely biased, and reads like an ad for Bitcoin, complete with emotive language such as 'miners were regarded by many as gullible morons' and I shit you not, actual referral links to exchanges to buy Bitcoins.
It's riddled with inaccuracies like 'Similarly, early adopters were able to purchase coins for as little as $0.01' - the first USD exchange rate, which is well-known, was 1309BTC/$1, which is far less than $0.01/BTC.
I won't go further with this post, as it would end up longer than the 'book' itself.

@_date: 2013-12-03 22:22:25
True, but if you're going to write a book with an audience in mind that presumably is a complete newcomer to Bitcoin, then wouldn't it be better to provide a brief kind of timeline history rather than some vague statement like 'early adopters got Bitcoins for $0.01'?
Most 'early adopters' didn't get into Bitcoin until the price was at ~$0.50-$1 or higher. Anyone who purchased in the second half of 2011 through the end of 2012 paid $5-$16/BTC. Very, very, very few got in at $0.01.
To be considered a decent worthwhile book on Bitcoin, I'd expect some kind of encyclopaedia backed up with evidence and some real unique research (i.e. researching aspects of the history or influence). Something like this would take time and effort, but that's why it would be valuable - because then it wouldn't be something I could simply look up on the Bitcoin.it FAQ and get basically the same information or better.
I can't believe this rubbish is on the front page - *I* could write something better than this in a day or two.

You're obviously not a trader then. 
A small tip little bro: If most people are using a certain system to make their trades, then that system tends to hold true.


Because I'm only identifying where the possible bottom value could be.
The exact name is evading me at the moment, but you only use that for an instrument using parallel lines to see where possible breakouts could be (typically used in combination with other instruments)
The reason I'm not using a regression line is because we already can see what the trend is - up. You don't even need to look at the chart to know this, because Bitcoin is inherently deflationary. Thus unless confidence in the currency is becoming dire, the price uptrend is going to be there.
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:35:01
Just like Bitcoin exchanges
And how else can people get Bitcoins? Mining? Who's going to have multi-thousand dollar ASICs?
The strongest argument in Bitcoin's favor over free or low-fee services such as Dwolla or Square was that the protocol was decentralized. Now however you can't access the protocol without going through a centralized 3rd-party, so Bitcoin sucks.
Services like Dwolla and Square are very recent, and are only the beginning. You also have Google Wallet on the scene now, and you send money for free simply by sending an email. It's probably not going to be long until you start to see these services becoming available worldwide rather than just in the US.

Incorrect, bubbles possibly without exception always return to where the speculation started. In Bitcoin's case, that is somewhere within $30-$200 probably. I guess you might call that my 95% confidence interval.
If you're invested and facing down a loss, it's very difficult to accept it and buy in at a price you *know* it's most likely going to.
With investment I've found, whatever your gut instinct is, it's usually correct. It's different from your emotions, which tend to overpower your gut instinct. Your 'gut instinct' is what you fundamentally know what is the most rational choice, whereas your emotions bring into the equation other factors such as 'What if I sell now, and miss out?'.
Being a smart investor means being able to overcome your emotions (everyone experiences them) and making the most rational choice.
I'm not invested in Bitcoin, so I have the advantage of not feeling emotionally attached to the price. What I see rationally is a typical bubble that has experienced the typical dead cat bounce, and is now coming off that. And I see that the speculation started at the $30-$200 area. Rationally, I am almost certainly confident it will return to this area then. **This is the most probable event**, and so why stay invested in an unprobable event? It's because you're balancing your emotions with what you rationally know to be true. It's a trade-off, because you want to feel better as well as get the best price.

Oh I see - I misread the sentence if that's the case. The use of the word 'unless' can be understood in two different ways. The case in which I understood it was 'As an exception to your case..' rather than 'Unless this is the case in particular..'
Anyway, I have stated this before in a previous post: It is better to sell now and take a loss - even if you bought in at $1242 and are now looking at a loss of over 50%.
This is for two reasons: Your $1242 investment will go from 50% loss to at least 80% loss if you hold. 
If you sell now though, for $600 and buy a Bitcoin later for $200, then you've effectively saved yourself from $400 of losses (~35%).
And if you really believe in Bitcoin, and your primary goal is to get more Bitcoins for the long term, then you can sell at $600 and get 3 Bitcoins instead of 1 at $200, whereas if you had bought at $1242 and held, you would not only lose fiat value dramatically, but you would also only have 1 Bitcoin to show for it.

This article does not understand what 'intrinsic value' is, and therein lies it's major fault.
Intrinsic value is the value of an item *in itself*, and thus does not include the values of what has been expended to produce it.
We do not include the costs of electricity/fuel in producing fiat banknotes in the intrinsic value of banknotes for instance.

So what you're saying that if someone wants to sell their Bitcoins, they can call up the electricity company and ask them to buy them for dollars?
Because that's the point we're discussing you know - the actual amount of dollars invested in Bitcoin, and thus the dollars you can take back out again.


In 2009 you could purchase 2 x HD5850 for $259 each ($518 total) and run them in crossfire. In February 2011 this would net you precisely 18.84BTC per day on average.
2 x HD5850 use [407W]( of total system power consumption at peak.
The average cost of electricity in 2011 in America was [12¢/kWh](
Using these figures, and running for 24hrs/day, for 30 days, we get a sum total of $35.16 for electricity, $518 for hardware, and 565 Bitcoins.
Even if you throw out rather than resell the hardware after those 30 days, the cost per Bitcoin would still only have been $0.98.
If you had resold the hardware, say on Ebay for $400 (23% off purchase price), the cost would be $0.27 per Bitcoin.
And Febuary 2011 was **over a year late** to the game, when **5.3 million Bitcoins had already been mined (Almost half of total so far)**

This is no different from Mid-2011, or earlier this year. It could go into another bubble again later, and it probably will, unless confidence is lost in the currency after this bubble - but I'm sure it'll stay interesting for a while.
If you're comparing it to the falls and subsequent rises we've seen on the way up however, then it's clearly different. It has to do with the exponential curve of the price. We are at the point of the bubble now where the 33% drop we experienced ($1242 down to ~$860) cannot be tolerated.
To try and explain it in real terms, it's because new buyers are so hyped about exponential gains, that any such big fall spooks them. These new buyers, at this stage, are pure speculators, and will either become spooked by the fall or impatient when it fails to return to going exponential.
What we have just witnessed is that impatience ticking over, where the price levelled off, and this wasn't enough for some speculators who settled for ~$1230-$1240 and sold out. This spooked the rest of the speculators, triggering a massive sell-off.

Incorrect. Back in 2011 when the price crashed from $31.91 to $0.01, most people lost their money because MtGox was hacked and their deposits were stolen.
The panic sellers are usually the ones who do the best in bubbles as well. Those who sell immediately at the start of the crash fare much better than those who 'hold on' for several months or years only to sell at the bottom.

Incorrect, it took 22 days
The bubble also started at ~$20-$30, not $60
We are yet to resolve the speculation area between $30-$60. I have a feeling we will come back to retest this area in this crash.
After Bitcoin peaked at $31.91 in mid-2011, it took two years to reach that price again.
Confidence may very well be decimated this time round.

A few thoughts:
Why would the US government care about $160 million, when it prints more than that every two months?
If you were the US government, wouldn't you seize upon the opportunity to quash confidence in a currency that acts a rival/threat to your own?
How would you get official permission to sell in tiny allotments each hour/day that wouldn't crash the price? Surely you'd need at least to sell in monthly allotments, just to give time for official proceedings to take place regarding each sale.
Why would a national government be any more proficient in regards to Bitcoin than something such as gold, which has a far larger market capitalization and is much more intuitive/established. National governments have historically sold gold irresponsibly at embarrassing prices.

Confidence is the least mature aspect of Bitcoin?
Perhaps it is, but whether it is or isn't has no relevance to addressing my point - which is that confidence is crucial to the success of a currency, and so Bitcoin can easily be stopped in it's tracks.
All it would take is a severe blow to confidence in Bitcoin. In 2011 when MtGox was hacked and Bitcoin crashed down to $0.01, many of us believed at the time that would have been it.
Yet it managed to recover, albeit it took 2 years, during which time prices stagnated at a low level. Probably I suspect because the Bitcoin protocol is innovative, and there were no other alternatives to continue with at the time. So despite Bitcoin's flaws, people were forced to stick with it.
But this time round you have a lot of alternative cryptocurrencies starting to gain traction, and the number is growing exponentially it seems as each day passes.
At the moment, they don't offer any significant advantages over Bitcoin, and most importantly they don't address Bitcoin's major flaws. But I think in perhaps in two to three years, we're probably going to see Bitcoin fade away as a truly better alternative takes it's place.

In 2011, $16.1 billion worth of gold was used in electronics alone
If gold were less scarce, it would be more widely used in industry due to it's elemental properties which make it favorable.
In other words, even if confidence in gold as a store of value was lost, decreased production for that use would be absorbed by industrial use.
Shitcoins on the other hand, only have value as a medium of exchange, and have no other use.

If this isn't a bubble, then what is?
You say there is a 'huge industry being created'. Personally, I don't see it. Sure, there are perhaps more places now who accept Bitcoin than a few months ago, even with the extreme volatility, but I really think you're deluding yourself if you think it comes anywhere close to the level of capital being poured into Bitcoin.
It's plainly obvious that the vast majority of these people pouring in money aren't looking to trade Bitcoins with each other; they're looking to make money in the short-term!
An '8% price drop' in Bitcoin at the moment I would class as volatility. A 'correction', that is, a return to the price before which the speculation began, would in my estimate reach somewhere around $20-$30/BTC (though increased 'difficulty' might increase this figure to some extent, just as 'inflation' does when it comes to commodities/stocks).
 
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:58:50
Predicting the Bitcoin market is not hard, because it's full of speculating noobs and it's not so easy to take advantage of the market due to a lack of services/tools. These services have just begun developing, and the big players aren't in the market as of yet.
Predicting say the FX market is a lot more difficult, if not impossible, because you're up against computer algorithms that trade the market, not to mention you rarely see this level of speculation anywhere else.

Incorrect, because eventually you run out of possible buyers.
Have we fully saturated the buyer's market at this stage? Considering how non-intuitive Bitcoin is to use and get into, I'd say we have. We've come close anyway.
Either way, one thing's for sure - we won't be seeing any more new buyers coming into the market for this bubble, no matter what the news (which because of this crash, will likely only be negative anyway). 
The reason is because new unwitting buyers are attracted by exponential gains. They don't want to miss out on making a fortune out of nothing. But now they see the price only holding steady, or worse, falling, what motivation do they have to invest? Because they believe in the currency? Please, don't make me laugh.
I disagree that the China news of today was the catalyst - whatever the catalyst, it occurred sometime ago when the price crashed from $1242 down to ~$860 - what we are seeing now is simply the aftermath, the dead cat bounce resolving itself. It would have happened without the news from China. It could have been any piece of bad news, perhaps not even that, but just mere impatience with the steady price.

In LETS, or at least one in my area I investigated, they believe that all work is to be valued equally, so 1 credit = 1 work hour regardless of the type of work it is.


Why not? Apart from your argument that work cannot or should be valued as equal.


If that's the case, then Bitcoin should be abandoned, as with all other cryptocurrencies. Some positive aspects may be non-essential, such as transparency. However with Bitcoin the very essentials are flawed. In addition, or as part of it, the possible advantages such as anonymity, unregulation, security, decentralization, etc. are all gone due to exchanges (before you ask, the exchanges are centralized)
I've read many people on this subreddit actually say that *more* regulation is a good thing, and that having many more exchanges are the future of Bitcoin.
What aspect is left that fiat doesn't have? ..Inbuilt deflation and irreversible transactions? These two arguably carry disadvantages, and the second is in part invalidated by exchanges (if they take a role in transactions).


I repeat that you are mistaking my position as to emulate LETS in totality. I was only drawing on LETS as an illustration for a particular aspect, not the entire system.

Which is exactly what I said:
"The figure of $14.6 billion comes from the number of Bitcoins (~12 million) multiplied by **the last traded price** on one of, or an average of, the major BTC/USD exchanges."

The China news came out at least two hours before this happened.
And I know that because I saw it posted here at that time. That means it was actually available knowledge for some time before that. 
Either people trading Bitcoin don't research Bitcoin developments (not even just reading the new posts section of r/Bitcoin), or China wasn't the reason for the crash.
Besides, if it was the news from China, why has the Bitcoin price been struggling so much, and never managed to break $1242? It traded oddly steady in the $1230-$1240 range for quite a long time (about 12 hours, the least volatile I've seen Bitcoin!)
No, the better explanation which explains all of this is that what we have just witnessed is a dead cat bounce. It couldn't reach $1242, because that would have invalidated the dead cat bounce. It's not intended of course, it just happens as selling pressure is piled on yet there are few buyers and they are cautious.
Low volume of cautious buyers + overload of desperate sellers = Price crash.
The sellers only become desperate when the price starts going down (i.e. It went down by about $80 slowly over 3 hours, gradually getting faster), and then the whole thing starts tipping over.
The China news may have had some kind of contribution, but in the large picture, it's the dead cat bounce that is the frame of reference.

I don't see how it would be worthless if it was evenly distributed initially, though I can see why having an equal distribution may be in fact be unfair or problematic.
I would favor 'intrinsic value' I guess you could say, where you *earn* your way into the system. But this would be obviously more difficult to conceive of properly.
Bitcoin on the other hand though has no intrinsic value, outside of being used as a medium of exchange. The way in which they are 'earned' is arbitrary and non-beneficial (solving random computational problems and expending electricity).

No matter what the number, even if it's only a few millionaires, that's still people who are guaranteed going to lose a part or all of their money in the end.
Once a crash starts, Bitcoin could quickly approach zero. Sure, there's likely to be some support at certain levels, but why should they form permanent levels of support? If anything, they might only act as 'slow zones' during the crash. You can see this happen in other real-life bubbles, where prices bump around support levels, and then continue dropping until it reaches the point where the speculation began (example: Silver from the 2011 peak to now, and continuing).

That's unsustainable - prices will have to rise, or the gold supply decreasing (mines closing down) will force them to

Do you think you have an advantage having bought in at ~$200/BTC or whatever, over those who bought in at $0.50/BTC?
If you withdraw money, where is that money coming from? Out of thin air, or from other investors?

Compare the growth% in capitalization to the growth% in transaction volume over the past two months. Nowhere close to each other.
Also how much of that transaction volume is actually contributing to the 'Bitcoin Economy', and not just between an individual's various private addresses for safekeeping?
Notice how transaction volume increased rapidly and fell down at the last bubble too? It's obviously not because people were being a part of the economy for a few days, and then decided not to.
Transaction fees are not a problem in itself, but I say it is because we are facing mass speculation in Bitcoin. Mass speculation = most people hoarding, getting just 2.3% daily transaction volume right now = dire future for the currency when transaction fees as main rewards begin to kick in. For these transaction fee rewards to work in the future, you need to have high transaction volume.
Bitcoin has been around for 4 years. Most economic bubbles have lasted that time, or longer. 
In 1995, a company known under various names but eventually 'Broadcast.com' was founded. In 1998, it set a record IPO one-day record, jumping from the opening price of $18 to $62.75 per share. In 1999 it was acquired by Yahoo for $5.9 billion. The company no longer exists, and now the domain name (broadcast.com) redirects to yahoo.com.
Bitcoin could go away just like that, if confidence is lost in the currency.

We can identify where 'healthy growth' becomes 'speculation' by examining the candlesticks.
Healthy growth is having old holders sell out (for say 50% profit), whilst new buyers continue to come into the market to buy it up.
I identify the speculation as having started at $20 earlier this year. How can I know this? Well if you look at the candlesticks, you'll see uninterrupted green upward candlesticks, meaning there are no healthy taking of profits.
This always tends to resolve itself with a crash later, which almost always happens to go down to the level where the speculation started. We saw this crash happen after the rise from $20-$30. After the crash, it can be regarded as healthy again.
We have had crashes for most areas between $20 and the April $268 peak, but there hasn't notably been anything for $30-$50 - so it could retest that level again (markets have an uncanny knack of doing this sort of thing, even years later after the event).
One things for certain: Anything above ~$200 is almost pure speculation, with hardly any profit taking. Expect a quite sudden drop to around that level soon.
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:54:14
The other claims don't require evidence, because they are not evidentiary claims. They are logical. 
Hitchens is quite right when he says that what is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence, but I'm not asking for evidence from you, so your statement is not only irrelevant, but inappropriate.
Rather than a plea for evidence, I asked you for a counter-argument (evidence or no evidence).

@_date: 2013-12-20 15:15:29


I think it's pretty self-evident
To explain it in a different way, if you flood the market with miners that can all pretty much do the job, then you either dilute supply or dilute cost. Since Bitcoin has a set supply, then it's the cost that is diluted.
This rests on the assumption that the price of mining machines will come down. I think it must, because what currently makes a mining machine expensive is that it is pretty much the only thing that can do the job - anything that's a few months old, or even in some cases a few weeks old, gets thrown in the garbage after paying $10K for it. Effectively it's a price squeeze caused by demand for mining machines that can do the job, and there's a limited supply - but in the future, that squeeze should end as the rate of innovation decreases dramatically (i.e. a mining machine may only become garbage after 3 years)

Don't you know?
When you pay for gold in dollars, the merchant typically either fixes the price on a daily basis, or they have a 5-second refresh on the checkout cart.
Dollars obviously don't go up or down 50% in a day, so there's no risk to the merchant or buyer. If it did, it would be hyperinflation or deflation, and so trade would probably stop altogether.
So why doesn't trade stop for Bitcoin during these times of massive volatility?

Yes, when Bitcoin starts to crash I'm sure many people will be buying server hosting and other little goodies with their thousand-dollar investments.. that's if the merchants dont leave beforehand due to 50% daily volatility of course.

Have you even been here when people discuss posting suicide hotline info when the Bitcoin price crashes and exchanges shut down their accounts? Have you ever had your wallet taken by someone else? please. grow up.
The need is certainly there, and the market clearly shows it, but Bitcoin is not the solution. Bitcoin perhaps shows the way forward - a crude sketch or draft copy of what's to come, if you will.
The fact is that most people will prefer fiat, primarily because it is the default and widely accepted, but also because it's much more intuitive to use and is much less volatile than Bitcoin.
Personally, I would recommend silver or gold over fiat and Bitcoin. These are somewhere between Bitcoin and fiat, and offer more overall advantages vs. disadvantages than either.

BTCChina accounts for over 50% of the market share, so the price should fall by at least that amount (which would it put it at $350, as of the price of yesterday - $700)
There aren't Bitcoins for certain exchanges you know. Bitcoins are global - they can travel from exchange to  exchange.

All one can do is laugh when the morons in this place exclaim 'If you had invested $50 3 years ago, then you would be a millionaire!!!', yet at the same time claim Bitcoin is a good currency. Very, very few of these people hold any substantial amount of Bitcoins btw, because they bought in late (i.e. 2011 or later)
Protip: If a currency transfers wealth in such an undeserving and volatile way as that, then it's not worth using - not even if 'but its going to change later!!!!', because will the millions be returned later? No? Oh I see. 
And those 'millions' doesn't come out of nowhere - they come out of thousands of mugs like you, who foolishly played around with mom's money. Eventually, the number of mugs available will be exhausted, and that's when it'll crash. And it'll keep doing the same, until eventually people lose confidence and abandon it.

We've gone from denial to 'who cares about them anyway!'
China is over 50% of the Bitcoin market. With them now out of the picture, the price will suffer in a dreadful manner.
But arguably worst of all, it shows that governments can and will shutdown Bitcoin. Not the protocol itself of course, but the exchanges - and nobody can get into Bitcoin any other way (who can mine these days?). And we are a loooooong way away from actually using Bitcoin as a currency completely independant of fiat.
This has dire implications for confidence in the currency, and confidence is absolutely fundamental/crucial to the success of any currency. Without it, Bitcoin will not be adopted.
No confidence = Bitcoin is dead.

Saying fiat is just as bad is no argument in favor of Bitcoin


And it's only going to get worse, as the rate of demand increases, and then eventually we have deflation to kick in. What joy!


Because volatility prevents it from being used as a medium of exchange, which is literally it's only use. Who is going to buy something with their Bitcoins, when it's going to be worth a lot more in a short period of time? And what merchant is going to accept the risk of up to 50% intra-day volatility. POS services are centralized and therefore susceptible to fraud, fee charging, hacking, delays, etc. - so there's no advantage over fiat - in fact, it's much more risky.


OK hero, but realize that the average rational-thinking person doesn't do that. If they know they're going to make more money by saving it in the short term, then they'll save it. Just look at what happens in periods of fiat deflation.


Bitcoin hasn't penetrated mainstream adoption. Few people have heard of it, and of those very few actually use it (most are speculators just looking for a quick buck).
Bitcoin could therefore go extinct very easily, especially since there are massive glaring flaws already appearing with Bitcoin.


The fact is that a morally unjust transfer is taking place.
This is another problem with Bitcoin: It is immoral to adopt.


Bitcoin is not a store of value, which is a necessary quality of money, and is therefore very important to point out (especially as many people here believe it is a store of value, which it clearly isn't). Precious metals are a store of value for instance.
Bitcoin fails even as a medium of exchange for the reasons mentioned (i.e. excessive volatility). It thus has no value at all.


You don't think people check $100 bills to see if they're counterfeit? Boy have I got news for you..


Transacting through localbitcoins.com could be deemed illegal by the government and could become the target of sting operations. Notably [this has already started happening](
Localbitcoins also opens you up to being defrauded or robbed. Examples: [1]( [2]( [3](
It is pretty much impossible to transact between fiat and Bitcoin pseudonymously. It was originally intended that the system would be pseudonymous in that it would be a system wholly contained within itself - but then people wanted to buy Bitcoin using fiat and it  had to start relying upon exchanges, which are extremely vulnerable to all sorts of mean and nasty things. Even if you transact in physical cash, you can be traced in various ways, and it's highly unlikely you would be able to trade in high amounts.

Log scale is a tool - it does not necessarily reflect any underlying exponential growth.
In fact, a log scale can be used for decline as well as a rise in price.
What is it a 'tool' for exactly? Well log scale allows you to clearly see and understand the change in *percent* rather than say dollar value on a linear chart.
If the price is at $1000 say, then you're not going to able to see what's been going on at the $1-$5 level very well on a linear scale, and it's hard to keep in mind the right perspective/frame-of-mind. 
This is applicable to many things technically. For example, levels of support and resistance - because buyers and sellers typically think in terms of percentage rather than price. Linear scale easily tricks our intuition in this regard, and so using log scale chart resolves this problem.

Maybe I've misunderstood what Bitcoins is about then.
Because as I've understood it, Bitcoin was all about lack of regulation and lack of personal identity.
I know that the point has been made that Bitcoin isn't completely anonymous, but only in the sense that addresses and transactions are transparent. This is not lack of 'anonymity' in the sense that I mean. In Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper on Bitcoin, there is an image showing that one of the points of Bitcoin is to keep personal identity *seperate* from one's Bitcoin address and transactions.
But let me query you on this also: If Bitcoin doesn't claim to prevent any of the problems I have put forth, then what is the point of Bitcoin exactly?
Decentralization? The exchanges are centrally controlled, and if the government can regulate users and exchanges, then that is also centralized control.

Implying altcoins aren't basically carbon-copies of Bitcoin
All it's going to take is for an altcoin to avoid one of the major problems Bitcoin has (i.e. excessive volatility), and then it's ogre for Bitcoin


They have no utility. You can't even buy or sell something without risking losing money, because intra-day volatility reaches as high as 50%+
And that's just one problem with Bitcoin. There are plenty more. 
Just to give you one more example: Centralized exchanges are being hacked or are defrauding their customers. One analysis showed 18 out of 40 exchanges took the money of customers and ran. This counts as a serious flaw of Bitcoin, because it is 99% reliant upon exchanges today, primarily because you need an ASIC miner to get any Bitcoins directly from the system and have no other choice essentially.

Actually it goes like this:
Most lose, very few win
This is for two reasons when it comes to Bitcoin.
Very briefly, the first is that when someone withdraws $1 mil, that typically comes from about 1000 people who have invested $1000 each (for how many have $1 mil to invest?)
The second is that that 'someone' is much more likely to be an early adopter, who paid peanuts to get in. Perhaps a few hundred dollars to mine it at most - and for that they got a million dollars worth of Bitcoins or so. Where does that extra money come from? It certainly doesn't come from out of nowhere. It comes from the new investors - and once the money is taken out of the system by this early adopter, what will the new investors have left to spread amongst themselves inevitably? Nothing, because the cash is gone!

Nobody should lose their livelihood, particularly if they have worked for it their entire life, even if they do it out of ignorance. If it is preventable, it should be prevented. All the spruiking on here is just as ignorant and is encouraging terrible decisions with terrible consequences.


I was very careful to say that is $20-$30/BTC is my *estimate* for the correct price. I've been observing Bitcoin since late 2010. When it started taking off at the beginning of this year, it was at ~$20 for a long time previous. $30 coincides also with the 2011 peak.
The main reason I suggest $20-$30 though is because after the peak in April earlier this year, it never returned to test that level again. It only went down to about $60, and $30-to-$60 was definitely part of the speculative move. Any test of that area, and the price will go down like a hot knife through butter.
In other markets, such a test is typical. It just seems to be the case that a speculative move inevitably *completely* unwinds itself, even if it doesn't do so immediately. In fact, the crash tends to over-extend itself below the fair value ('despair').

To surmize your explanation, what you essentially seem to be saying is that the outlier data points, 'error' as you refer to them, are wrongly skewing the linear regression line upward (and thus the future predicted price).
However, I do not see why this should be considered as wrongly skewing it. I think it is a correct skew. To begin with, those outlier data points are not errors - they are real prices people bought at, and thus should be considered.
Though considering it, it may indeed be in error to include them, as they represent speculation rather than genuine long-term growth - and what the mean should reflect is arguably the level of this genuine growth.
But how does one distinguish between what data points to include, and what not to include?
In any case, I do not believe it would be too far off, because the periods of speculation are short in duration, and thus do not have a significant effect on the mean price overall - especially since the data points include almost the entire history of the price of Bitcoin. Not to mention the big moves down would offset the big moves up to some degree (and they almost invariably are found together).
For instance, let's say we have an upward variation from the mean of 500%, for 5% of the time (18 days a year). Let's say the aftermath of the crash takes 200% off this rise in the mean during the same amount of time (5%). that leaves 300% x 0.05 = 15% rise overall in the year for the mean price.
So we might conclude that the error is 15%. With a mean price of $190, that would change it to $161.50, which isn't a significant difference really - at least not in these times, when we're talking of daily volatility of hundreds of dollars.

Intrinsic value comes from an object's use
Gold for instance has elemental properties that make it uniquely necessary for many applications
Shitcoin on the other hand has no intrinsic value other than as a medium of exchange, and yet it appears to have failed even that. For instance I, as a merchant, can't use Bitcoin because of the excessive volatility and this is predictably not going to get better, but worsen as time goes on.
Shitcoin has no value whatsoever - at least fiat has some small amount of use as plastic or paper, but Bitcoin is intangible.

@_date: 2013-12-16 19:19:36
That's just a loser's rationalization
Nobody wants to be a loser, so they rationalize their investment losses ('It's not a loss until I sell!', 'It'll come back to profits after the correction!')
The reality is that the 'correction' actually typically takes place over a few years. Bitcoin is not immune to this - we can see this from the aftermath of the crash from $31.91 in 2011, which it took two years to recover from.
This is because it's easy to stay in for a few months, which is what most people do - particularly because they share the same rationalization. Thus, confidence must be totally drained before it can rise again - even the diehard investors must begin to question and fear their continued investment.
The fact is that you would be far better off selling now and buying in later at say $200, than keeping your money in a falling asset for a year or two+.
But you don't sell because you don't have it worked out. You're not in control of your emotions. You're too fearful to capitulate, even though you know what's coming.

Not only does the low trade volume make it unappealing for merchants to adopt, but Bitcoin is also incredibly risky to accept due to massive volatility swings of up to 50% in a matter of hours.
There are some places which charge a small fee to eliminate this volatility, by instantly exchanging the Bitcoins into fiat for you, but then it becomes just like Paypal. Why bother?
Not only that, but if you investigate, you'll find that the above is only an option for medium to big business, or for those in the US of A. For instance if you live in Australia, you're not allowed to withdraw from Bitpay until you have at least $1000 in sales. Who wants to trust hundreds of dollars with a small-time unregulated (and possibly insecure) online startup until you have enough to withdraw? Not to mention you might not even reach $1000 in sales, especially seeing how few people actually buy with Bitcoin.
The instant Bitcoin-to-fiat exchange also isn't genuine use of Bitcoin. It's only using Bitcoin to get more fiat, which is taking away investment from the Bitcoin system. Bitcoin was meant to be adopted as a currency, not used as a split-second utility.

Where did I say in my original post, or indeed in any of my posts, that it is 'Bitcoin's fault'?
I think it a fault *of* Bitcoin, but not one the Bitcoin protocol is necessarily responsible for, though it might be said that the way the protocol is designed - what other choice could there have been than to have people buying through external exchanges rather than mining?
You have still not denied my claim, nor any of the other claims I made.
The fact is that if you want to get into Bitcoin, you typically have no other option but to engage in risky behavior.
The only sense in which I agree with you is that this does 'drive people away'. The difference between me and you is that I argue that it should!
Anyone who is informed would not so readily take such personal risks. You want to stop people from being informed, because it discourages them from getting into Bitcoin.
In other words, 'Get them in.. whatever the cost' (a double entendre, I'll point out). Should be the slogan of this subreddit by now.

Wrong, they have a vested interest in higher prices
Higher prices = Greater interest/inflows = Greater profits on fees
Lower prices = Disinterest or fear/standing back = Decreased profits on fees
Just look at what happened after the 2011 crash. Volumes didn't recover for 2 years.
I'm guessing you weren't around in 2011 when exchanges would shut down citing 'technical difficulties' when the price was crashing. I think MtGox closed for a whole week during the 2011 crash (and this was before it got hacked, sending the price down to $0.01)

It does take it into account - it's in log scale, that's *exponential* growth
That means Bitcoin isn't just going exponential, it's going parabolic - as you can see on the graph.
And BTW before you noobs to TA start whinging to distract from the point:
From Investopedia:
"As you can see in Figure 5, an upward trendline is drawn at the *lows* of an upward trend. This line represents the support the stock has every time it moves from a high to a low. Notice how the price is propped up by this support. This type of trendline helps traders to anticipate the point at which a stock's price will begin moving upwards again."

Frankly, not surprised.
You are too highly strung in my judgement, as you are treating this as though it is some grave concern.
You believe I feel 'victimized', but I'm just enjoying myself as I observe this bizarre inquisition this subreddit seems to have going on here in regards to me.
It doesn't bother me, reading these posts gives me a good chuckle.
I've been accused of being a paid shill, of being part of a orchestrated conspiracy to take down the price of Bitcoin, of being someone who sold Bitcoins early and is now jealous (or alternatively, did not buy Bitcoins at all, and now wants to buy them cheaply), of being a 'cyberbully' and a 'cyberstalker', and now there's also you who describes me as an irresponsible 'ass' who violates the bounds of civil discussion.
These trumped up charges are ridiculous.
This place is a goddamn madhouse, and I'm about three quarters serious when I say that now.
It made me somewhat uneasy responding to your post this time rather than humored though, because you appear to take the matter as one of genuine seriousness, and thus demand my own seriousness. 
'Georedd' at least appears to be insane or ignorant or a combination of both - you on the other hand seem to have opened yourself up to being offended by me, and thus it wouldn't feel right to expend a joke on you. Thus I give you this reply.

localbitcoin.com isn't an option either.
Haven't used it personally, but I get the jist of what it is.
Dealing one-on-one still opens you up to being personally identified and defrauded/ripped off. You are free at least from government regulation, but if the government outlaws such transactions, then essentially it becomes like meeting your local drug dealer.
Given the option between say for example, regulated yet safe and legal exchanges, and meeting the shady dude you don't know for an illegal transaction, which would you or the ordinary person tend to choose?
Ironically that site seems to be down at the moment.

And as for the community only promoting content that is favorable, that is all that happens in this place. 
Aside from me, even the most docile of critiques are downvoted - or even if merely they can be construed as a critique. 
For instance I saw a joke image posted here earlier, and it was pro-Bitcoin, but it wasn't obviously so, as it essentially called Bitcoin day-traders scumbags.

In all practicality, it doesn't need to be. Because there's no advantage to be gained from exchanging LETS credits for dollars or vice-versa.
Of course, someone could do it (at no benefit to them), and if found out, then they would be kicked out of the group by the community/organizer.
I only used it as an example to illustrate my point, not as a system that should actually be fully emulated.
Rather my point is, take away the advantage from speculation, and people won't do it. You won't need to 'enforce rules', because the system effectively enforces it by default. No need for any centralized entity.

And some people here still say that Bitcoin investors are smart enough to know the difference between market cap and *actual* capitalization..
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:03:33
It's not a 'horrible fit'
It's calculated by a computer using the past 1200 days of 'close' prices to calculate the mean, so it is precisely accurate. It's not meant to display the historical mean btw, only the present and near future (that's why the mean is at $95 in 2012 when the price was steady at $10-$20 for a long time)
The channel shown captures 68% of price variation. As stated, if you apply a standard deviation of 2, it shows what accounts for 95% of price variation - and the upper bound of that is a price of $495 in June, 2014.
You cannot apply *linear* regression to an exponential chart. It doesn't have be anyway - for as I have explained, it takes into account whatever exponential growth in Bitcoin there is, since it calculates based on the previous price data and the channels use SD (which is applied to both exponential and linear charts in the same way)

There's your problem. The exclusivity of mining is far greater now than in the first year or so of Bitcoin, when Satoshi was still around and everyone with a CPU could mine Bitcoin or get a donation from a 'faucet'.
Either Satoshi didn't anticipate this, or he did and simply hoped that most users would operate solely within Bitcoin as a closed system and not just be speculators who deal with fiat. 
I lean towards the latter myself. Something he said back in early 2010 gives credence to this:
'I'm sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.'

Also, whilst it's true that the market cap is $14.6 billion, not 'every Bitcoin is worth $1200'.
I think very few people in this place would understand what market cap really means, thus in the way they understand it, $14.6 billion really is bullshit.
I mean for example, I just responded to a guy an hour or two ago who didn't understand how a trend line works.
And as suggestive evidence of this, you can usually find posts or popular comments on the front page about how the value of Bitcoins just eclipsed Cyprus' $13 billion money supply or whatever, as though to say there's more money invested in Bitcoin than there is money in Cyprus.

I think the problem is that it didn't start fully-closed at the very beginning.
I do have issues with the hypothetical of Bitcoin becoming fully closed, which I haven't entirely explored but have thought about.
A few examples: Inherent deflation, complexity of use, unsuitability for micro-transactions, threat of replacement or even just competition by alternative cryptocurrencies
I also believe some programmers have at least some degree of centralized control over the system, such as transaction fees. Is this correct?
These concerns don't concern exchanges, but the system itself.

Georedd, it's been no secret of mine that my objective is to save people from the coming crash in price. This is *because of* my belief that Bitcoin is a flawed system and destined to go to zero, not somehow in spite of my true opinion as you seem to wildly assume.
Posts such as these (and the ones in this thread) give me confidence that what I'm doing is having a positive impact.

Two or three or so have been unlisted from the subreddit for being off-topic or (I'm assuming) using undesirable language.

The above cases are reasonable, however there have been I think 2 instances when the text of a post has been removed without sufficient reasoning. As far as I can identify, I was not being off-topic or totally uncivil. This was about two or three weeks ago as I recall.

@_date: 2013-12-03 22:06:18


I think I'll pass on that 'Ram Dass lecture' you recommended. It doesn't seem to have worked for you.


Your first assumption is correct. I believe cryptocurrency could or probably is 'going somewhere', but not Bitcoin. It's flawed, and I think it will be replaced by a better alternative.
I've been observing Bitcoin since late 2010, when it was about $0.50/BTC. My hypothesis hasn't been proven wrong several times; it's been proven right - the 2011 bubble, the the bubble earlier this year, and now this bubble. 
These bubbles will keep happening until confidence is lost in the currency and it is abandoned. 
Not just because of the bubbles, but because all the things that Bitcoin held promise for - i.e. anonymity, unregulation, security, etc. - have now all been scrapped. In fact, the opposites to these are now becoming increasingly embraced by the Bitcoin community it seems!


Every author has a personal bias which they express, even if they try their best to conceal it from their work.
The difference between a good author and a bad author in this regard, is that the good author cites objective verifiable evidence in support of his claim against the *best* possible counter-arguments, whilst the bad author attacks strawman arguments with statements that are essentially 'I said it. There, that's it, now believe it'.
For example, a line from your work: '*Another piece of fantastic luck that headed Bitcoin's way in November: BTC China went online, a Bitcoin exchange in mainland China, and the response from Chinese consumers was BUY, BUY, BUY.*'
No citations, no reasoning suggested or supported by evidence, no background details (i.e. how did this come about and why, what developed in China prior, etc.), nothing. And that's all leaving aside the fact that you sound like Bitcoin's head cheerleader.
Your only evidence, or insight, to support this is contained in the next paragraph, which reads: '*The Chinese, like us, have a large middle class population eager to diversify*'.
And that's it. A generalization, again supported by no hard evidence, or even a basic explanation. 'I said it. That's it, there it is, so believe it'.
Everything about this 'book' is bad. Even the paragraph structure. For instance you have paragraphs that consist of one sentence. Here's one of them:
'*It is also possible Bitcoin will be left in the dust by a newer, as-yet-not-invented technology.*'
You do not even add an extra sentence to summarize what these 'as-yet-not-invented technologies' might be, or why they might constitute a theat to Bitcoin.
The whole thing is written out as a kind of FAQ, but one where you have to read through the whole thing a linear fashion rather than jump down to the question you need answered (you don't even have an index!)
As someone else has mentioned here, the text looks like it's been deliberately double-spaced between lines and increased in size to look more lengthy, as though it were an undergraduate's paper rushed without the time to meet the required word-count.
This 'book' is something that would be better left in the comment section of some blog, not *sold* to people. Even if it was for free, I might have given you a pass. But to actually charge people for *this*.. I can't believe people actually bought this rubbish.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:50:53
I don't mean run out of people, I mean run out of buyers.
The world's 7 billion people do not have immediate or short-term access to Bitcoin. The current bubble requires a constant influx of buyers in the short-term. As the price becomes ever-more exponential, so too dues the required number of buyers become exponential.
When the prices cease being exponential, then gains become much less attractive for new buyers, and that's usually how the bubble begins it's end.

Personally I think it was flawed from the beginning. Bitcoins should either have been distributed equally from the beginning, or earned in some appropriate way that solves the problem (and not in a way that rewards early adopters, which is a somewhat separate point).
I would put to you that we are not seeing reliable 'growth', but rather short-term speculation. Most of the capital invested in Bitcoin at the moment will be taken out in the short term.
We are also seeing these speculative bubbles happening time and time again. Would anybody say that $30/BTC was *not* a speculative bubble in early 2011, when it took almost *two years* to reach that price again?
Bitcoin may be viable in the long term, but I personally doubt it for a number of reasons.

I actually have Bitcoins from 2010 and 2011 and that I mined on my HD5770 (srs)
I first heard of Bitcoin back in late 2010 through a youtube user by the name of 'davincij15'. I investigated it and discovered its serious flaws which affect it's long-term viability (and impair it's current use), but I mined a few BTC for fun/speculation because I already had one of the best and most efficient cards for the job, and it only cost a few dollars in electricity.
I'll be honest with you: I was interested in selling them given the recent price rises, but upon trying to sign up to the exchanges, I quickly gave up that idea. You can take your chances if you want, but I'm not giving them my personal documents.

Dead Cat Bounce Definition | Investopedia
A temporary recovery from a prolonged decline or bear market, followed by the continuation of the downtrend. A dead cat bounce is a small, short-lived recovery in the price of a declining security, such as a stock. Frequently, downtrends are interrupted by brief periods of recovery - or small rallies - where prices temporarily rise. This can be a result of traders or investors closing out short positions or buying on the assumption that the security has reached a bottom.
BTW here's a gold quote from you:

If you look at my account history, you'll find it's 7 or 8 months old. I was here warning of the bubble back in April as it was happening as well.
Then I didn't start posting again until about three weeks ago. I didn't call a dead cat bounce when it went from $900 and $450 (which it did recover from and reach $1242). 
I did however call both [the bubble popping]( *just before* the dramatic crash down to $840 when it was looking like a negative downtrend, *and* the dead cat bounce - and I held firm on that even as it was at $1240.

It doesn't matter if volatility is up or down - if it's up, it means that the buyer is losing money by giving away his Bitcoins in exchange.

If you're unable to buy your way into/out of the system or there's no possible benefit from doing so, then there's no chance of speculation.
You seem to think that preventing speculation requires the use of some kind of 'law' to regulate the system. This is not necessary. 
Take LETS for an example, where the 'credits' are not allowed to be bought be bought in dollars from other participants - the only way you're allowed to receive or give credits is by actually doing work. That said, theoretically you could claim to have done work, when in fact you merely did an exchange of dollars for credits. 
Why hasn't LETS fallen victim to this? Simply because there is no motivation to do so; because the system is designed in such a way that speculation is impossible. You don't gain anything by hoarding LETS credits. They don't gain interest, and they always remain equivalent to something firmly set in reality (in LETS, 1 credit typically equals 1 hour of work-time).

I don't have the imagination for what 'could be'. All I know is that the Bitcoin system won't work in the long-term as it currently is, and what I propose is what I think is a better option.
If it's true that the fiat system is flawed, then that is a motivation to move to something that doesn't share the same flaws.
It would be preferable for it to be adopted widely and quickly, but it's better to have slow, steady growth, than an influx of speculators who jeopardize the long-term confidence in the currency. 
If you believe in something, you should convert people for the right reasons. It is not only responsible, it is also wise.

Keeping information from people by censoring dissent and the presentation of uncontroversial facts is not 'trying to make it easy for people'.
There's nothing controversial about saying that most people have to hand over their personal information and documents to get Bitcoins (by means of buying them from exchanges).

That is a false equivalence
Precious metals and (most) stocks have 'intrinsic' or 'fundamental' value, and therefore promise returns which do not rely primarily upon the investments of newcomers, as a pyramid scheme does. If people paid less for gold, then supply would simply tighten and cause a price squeeze upwards, because it costs a certain amount to mine and there's no way around it.
Bitcoin on the other hand has no intrinsic value other than as a medium of exchange, and it is even failing at that it seems (with intra-day volatility at 50%+ and speculation rife..). The way Bitcoin grows in price works exactly as a pyramid scheme - money flows from new buyers to the early adopters who sell, and then for those new buyers to make any money, they need to bring in new buyers. Bitcoin's difficulty target is flexible, and therefore it's value could easily go next to zero.

Incorrect, I've been right about half a dozen times over the past 3 weeks or so, with no errors. And I was right back in April too.
I've given my reasoning for the price is crashing and why it will continue to do so until it reaches the price where the speculation began.
Just before the first major crash two weeks ago:
When I called it a dead cat bounce after it rose from $840 to $1137 and said it would peak at ~$1200 (it ended up peaking at $1240):
Reasoning for why it's continuing to fall:
My reasoning for warning to sell even at $865 (the price then dropped to $575, and as I write this, the price is at $680):
You can find many more of my comments filled with reasoning.

Mate this is just common knowledge
Early adopters get the most Bitcoins, and back then the price was very low, so most people have invested fuck all when it comes to dollars. That's how the system works.
Here, if you don't believe me, look at the USD exchange trade volume prior to May 2011:
Only about $5,000/day on average
Now look at the number of Bitcoins in circulation by May 2011:
About 5 million - almost half the Bitcoins in existence.

It depends what exchange you use
People using MtGox and BTC-E are having troubles, probably other exchanges too. Do you think these exchanges will have $50million liquidity just to allow one early adopter to cash out? Of course not. They'll willingly accept your money, but it's near-impossible to cash out (especially once the crash hits)
That's why most people here will recommend you use localbitcoins.com, where you can go and risk meeting 'Mamoud3848' in some shady back alley to sell your Bitcoins person-to-person.
But really, Bitcoin isn't meant as a get-rich-scheme. It's a medium of exchange, you're not meant to 'invest' in it. Would you say you 'invest' in dollars or Euros or any other currency?
Bitcoin is in a bubble at the moment built up by speculators like you looking to cash-in, make money, then cash out again. Do you're think you're going to be one of the lucky ones who makes it out just in time?

Sure, precious metals aren't instantly transportable - and thus not appropriate for all microtransactions (they are for things like coffee though), however at least they're a reliable store of value.
Bitcoins on the other hand aren't a store of value, and unfortunately, it's beginning to appear now that it has no hope in hell of becoming a reliable medium of exchange either!
We do need a solution to this problem, and cryptocurrencies currently seem like the best contender - however Bitcoin isn't it. Bitcoin is a failure, and that's already been demonstrated. Time to learn from our mistakes and move on to a new, better, cryptocurrency that at least works as a reliable medium of exchange.

It's true that gold's industrial use accounts for only a fraction of it's total consumption, however keep in mind that it costs a lot of money to mine gold yet there are many applications for which is gold the most economic choice or for which there is no substitute.
Gold contacts on electronics for example are favored because of their high electrical conductivity and resistance to corrosion, whilst remaining economical due to the very small amount of gold used - however there are so many electrical contacts made, that it ends up being a large amount of consumption in total.
Gold has recently come off a speculative bubble, where it reached ~$2000, however it costs well over $1000 to mine an ounce of gold, on average (at least going by the following figures):

We know the reason why Bitcoin rises over time, which is that it's a deflationary currency. This has nothing to do with the system getting 'better' or investors gaining more confidence.
For instance, would you say investors were more confident when it dropped to $60 earlier this year, than they were when it was peaking at $32 in 2011?
This 'confidence' you speak of is for the most part, just speculation - they have no intention of using Bitcoin as a currency, rather they want to make fiat out of it.
Real confidence is measured by a different set of factors, such as 'will I be able to sell my goods today without the risk of being subject to 50% intra-day volatility', or 'are my savings safe and not going to be subject to theft or loss', or 'will I be free from government regulation and will my payments be anonymous'

Going to be interesting to see if a deadline is firmly handed down by the Chinese government, or if they suspend exchange operations beforehand.
If it's the former, there'll be a massive panic and flash-crash almost definitely. The later prospect is interesting too though - because what will happen if nobody sells, a whole bunch of Bitcoins and Bitcoin holders/buyers simply get wiped off the map without a trace. How would the Western markets react to that, and how far down would it go (since it has no Chinese market price to compare to)

You're not a millionaire until you cash out. Where do you think said millions are going to come from? From out of nowhere? No, it's going to come from the capital that thousands of other mugs invested (you're probably one of them).
To be a winner, you have to pull out at the right time (not too early, not too late), before everybody else does. Because once these millionaires actually do start becoming millionaires, the pool of capital quickly dries up leaving the vast majority of people with Bitcoins with nothing.
BTW for your information I have 3,174 Bitcoins. I'm just not a filthy speculator like you. If I was, I would have cashed out at $30 back in 2011. Or if not then, $30 earlier this year, or $40, or $50, etc..

I disagree. Or at least, that Bitcoin seemed to avoid this is what intrigued me in it. And I think that's mainly what others have been intrigued by too.
Bitcoin, as a system-in-itself without external exchanges, seems to have given us a positive (though not perfect, in my view) solution to this problem. Not just the problem of having a lack of regulation with total security, but with total anonymity and yet total transparency too.
I personally think these ideas will advance to create something better than what Bitcoin currently is. I do not by any means think this is the end of cryptocurrency, but I think there is an inevitable end to Bitcoin - it will either be abandoned or superceded.

@_date: 2013-11-27 13:09:23
Let's say that in 3 years time, there are 1 million Bitcoin exchanges. Some of these are online-only, others have physical branches, and there are even Bitcoin ATMs.
Any exchange still leaves the user vulnerable for the four reasons I mentioned: volatility, fraud, regulation and personal identification. I'll add a fifth: security (exchanges can be 'hacked' by third-parties).
Isn't the point of Bitcoin to guard against these things? You might say that the chance of fraud and hacking will be so slim with so many exchanges, and that's true (it will be just as it is with modern-day financial institutions), but what about regulation and personal identity?
No matter how many exchanges there are, the user will *always* lose their anonymity and thus be subject to government regulation (i.e. arbitrarily-set taxes or transaction limits or accountability).
It's true that Bitcoin might have a better chance if everybody only used it within the system. Though this at least is not the case now, and so it only seems like a pipe-dream to me. Not to mention it would take probably at least decades, and by then some better solution might have come along.

I think the previous bubble still hasn't been resolved yet. The current one seems just like a continuation of it. It never crashed down to $30-$50 where the speculation started. Markets have a peculiar tendency to always revisit untested levels of speculation, even years after the fact.
Look at most bubbles, and you'll see that prices typically take at least a year or two just to recover somewhat and begin a new uptrend

It's either going to infinity dollars or zero.

The end game is that people lose confidence in the currency, so it gets abandoned and people stop trading it - making it's price zero.


The majority of gold is mined and kept/used for investment purposes, i.e. as a medium of exchange.
It's true that if no one wanted to use gold, then it would stop being mined and it's price would be zero, just like Bitcoin's price is going to be.

Silver has intrinsic value, which is far greater than that of the pieces of paper or plastic you call 'fiat money'. An ounce purchased 5 years ago for $14 is worth as much as an ounce bought today $20. This is not a pyramid scheme, because the value of getting in exceeds the value of getting out.
Bitcoin on the other hand has no intrinsic value other than as a medium of exchange, so it's value is zero. Anyone who buys a Bitcoin instead of 2 kilograms of silver today is getting robbed of their wealth. The value of getting out of Bitcoin exceeds the value of getting in, making it a pyramid scheme.

The fiat price has nothing to do with Bitcoin as a protocol if you want to put it that way - the price could, and probably is, going to zero. 
There is no reason it has to have a high value in dollars. It's not a store of value; it's only value is as a medium of exchange, and if no one can get into (i.e. via exchanges or mining), then it can't even be used as that! (worthless)

My point is that is Bitcoin has become reliant upon exchanges - no one can 'mine' Bitcoins any more, except for a very, very small minority of people.
All it would take is for one exchange to go offline for whatever reason and Bitcoin would fall straight back down to peanuts again.

Essentially a base value, or non-speculative value.
For instance, if the price can't drop below what I call the 'true value', because miners would be operating at a loss.


The problem is that older mining machines can no longer compete at all, which effectively means that companies who have the best new hardware can charge basically whatever they want.
But in a market where old hardware is comparable to new hardware, you have to cut your prices to offer a competitive advantage - and there's certainly no chance left of being able to charge whatever you want.


The cost of mining right now is increasing, not decreasing - mainly because the mining hardware producers have a monopoly on the market and are causing a supply squeeze (either intentionally or unintentionally)
Have you not heard of those ASIC mining machine orders taking months, or even over a year to be fulfilled?

We haven't yet reached a bottom, you need to give it much more time
Don't worry, you won't 'miss out' - look at charts of other bubbles, and you'll see that the price doesn't go back up immediately after the crash. It takes weeks, months, or even years of a low stable price until it finally starts to slowly rise again.

There are a few indicators from which you can assess it's 'true' value, such as how much it costs in fiat to 'mine', how many non-personal transactions are actually occurring (quite opaque with Bitcoin), where the major speculation began, etc.


What about if people simply lost confidence in Bitcoin as a currency, and returned to fiat which is what they're familiar with as a 'best option'?

No, the speculation started well before then. Try $30, or even possibly lower.
The $30-$60 area was never retested. How long did that move take, a day or two? I'd have to go and check, but it a move up based on pure speculation.


Is this the argument all Bitcoin advocates are now reduced to?
Honestly, I'm not jealous. Sure I would love to have made a fortune, but I know I would have cashed out at $30.. and if not that, then $40.. etc.
And that's part of the point - I wouldn't have been in Bitcoin because I actually believe in it, the reason I would have been in it was to rob people of their fiat.
I don't believe in it, that's why I didn't invest before, and I don't intend to invest now or in the future. Because I know it's doomed, unless you can prove me wrong with an argument other than 'ur jst jealous lol xD'
Who knows what Bitcoin could go to. 7 months ago I said on this subreddit that Bitcoin would go to '$1 quadrillion dollars++++'. It crashed at $266 down to around $60. Whatever Bitcoin goes to this time round, it'll crash no matter what in the end, because as the article says - you eventually run out of buyers, and then people who bought in to make fortunes become impatient and start selling/panicking

Sell now
It WILL drop to $30-$200, it's only a matter of time.
Don't believe the shills here who say 'If you believe in it, hold onto it'. This logic can be easily demonstrated as irrational:
If you bought a BTC for $1000 and hold, you'll only end up with that amount in the end.
But if you sell that $1000 BTC now for $760, and buy back in at $200, you've increased your BTC position by over 4 times - even including your losses.
And if you're going to hold, then be prepared to hold for *years*. That's what holding really means, so be aware of it. Just look how long the people who bought in 2011 at ~$32 had to wait for before they started seeing a return (two years).

The price growth far exceeds transaction volume growth, and those 'transactions' include moving BTC between private addresses, or other irrelevant reasons.
Bitcoin recently gave us some hard data on the Bitcoin economy. I think they said it was about 12,000 merchants accepting Bitcoin, and there were only 6,296 transactions on 'Black Friday'. Normal daily transactions were on average **100 a day** they said.
Let's say the average person spends [$41]( per transaction. That's only $4,100 a day - amongst 12,000 merchants.
Hell, let's make it $200 per transaction. That's still only $20,000 which is peanuts compared to the market capitalization of several *billion* dollars.
I agree that whilst further growth in merchant adoption could give fundamental value to Bitcoin (as it's only value is as a medium of exchange), I see that as being hampered by the current speculation. And once the bubble crash is completed, confidence will wane once again in the currency, and merchant numbers will remain steady or disappear.
What Bitcoin needed was slow, steady growth that was firmly rooted in the use of the currency - not a speculative bubble in which users are mostly just interested in hoarding to make more fiat in the short-term.

Incorrect, the price dropped from $1240 by about $80 about two hours before the news from China came out.
Bitcoin traded in the $1230-$1240 range for 12 hours, perhaps the least volatile I've ever seen it. This peculiarity was because of heavy selling pressure from those who bought at the $1242 high, or those who bought at lower who wanted to at least cash out at the previous high.
This is how dead cat bounces always work: There's a significant crash (in this case, ~30%), then a recovery driven by those who rationalize it's only a 'healthy, short-term correction', then those who bought in near the top expecting to see massive gains put on heavy selling pressure due to anxiety or impatience. The dead cat bounce thus comes very close to the previous high, but *never* makes it above it (or it's invalidated). If it doesn't make it above, that's when we know it's begun a downtrend, as the new highs are lower than previous highs (i.e. $1242 vs. $1240).
What happens next is explained in the original post above.
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:21:03


Then what has it to do with, speculation?
I specified in my post that I leave 'demand' out of the equation. What I contemplating is essentially the 'base value' of Bitcoin.
I wouldn't say that it is minor though.. an ASIC rig costs tens of thousands of dollars.. so you're only going to sell Bitcoins for amounts that make that amount up. Reducing that cost to say, $500, could reduce the price of Bitcoins dramatically I imagine.

Do you not know how to spell 'weighted'?
There's nothing wrong with using the MtGox price, as it's the largest and most used exchange.
Besides, the difference in volatility I imagine would be minimal between the different exchanges.
Here is a comparison of BTE-C vs MtGox pricing for instance on the historical volatility 10-day interval measure:
You just seem desperate to find a way out of reality.
The reality is that Bitcoin is more volatile than ever at the moment - except for when it has been in a bubble, which should be a flashing warning signal to anyone about to invest their dosh in Bitcoin.

I don't even try to short Buttcoins, because the market price could go to zero at any given instant.
Just look at what happened in 2011 - the price went from $31.91 to less than $0.01 in a matter of minutes.
The same could happen now if a major exchange is hacked, or they do a runner, or they get shut down by government intervention (i.e. like what's happening to BTCChina)
Plus I don't feel comfortable with giving my passport and other important personal documents to unregulated shady small-time entities operating in foreign countries.
And the horror stories we've heard of from here about msising/stolen/delayed funds in relation to ALL the major exchanges is the final nail in the coffin to investing your money in Bitcoin - even if you just want to short it.

Just goes to show how far gone the original Bitcoin community now is. It's no wonder Satoshi has since left the project and now wants nothing to do with it. He realized it was doomed early on.


Gold prices are high because the cost to mine is well over $1000/oz. I can provide you evidence of this if you desire.
Bitcoins on the other hand can be mined at any price, as the 'difficulty' is flexible.

yfw when if you think about it, the US literally stole Bitcoins from someone by raiding them and seizing their computer.
This could happen to anyone deemed to have done something 'illegal'.
With a bit of imagination and effort, the US government (and other national governments) could probably seize the Bitcoins of whoever they want.
They can't shutdown the Bitcoin protocol, but they sure as hell can shutdown anyone found using it (particularly businesses).
Think about it, how many people are getting Bitcoin today *without* handing over all their personal information and documents?

People don't want to be pseudononymous when they give charity
In fact, they want the opposite. They want to have recognition.
Just look at Kiva for example, where you have a public profile which tracks your loans and displays your name on loan pages.
Or more conventional charities, where you can have a dialogue with the person you've donated to - the idea here is that they know *you* were the donor.
You also say you can donate with Bitcoin without a 3rd party. Yet unless you know a person in the disaster zone personally, how do you know who to donate to, and how do you know it's not a scammer on the other end? Plus, having money doesn't help very much in disaster situations. What is really needed are supplies, physical help, etc. - currency only helps buy you that.

Growth was significantly slower at below $200, but I'm convinced it could quite well possibly go back down to $30 for two reasons:

My credibility is drawn from my previous posts, which show that I have predicted what was going to happen time and time again.
None of my predictions have been wrong, apart from slight inaccuracy. I.e. predicting the peak of the dead cat bounce to be at '~$1200' rather than the $1240 it reached.
Bitcoin on the other hand has no credibility, it's just promoted by shills like you. Volatility and lack of regulation prevents merchants from using Bitcoin

Bitpay was the first thing I looked at, but it's ~$1000 minimum balance to withdraw for my country
Notably if you live in the UK, you have to have a minimum balance of 1000 pounds (~$1642).


If it's not then the price shouldn't be where it's at. And that's my point - Bitcoin is currently in a speculative bubble, and there is a long way down further to go when it comes to the price.
Very few merchants actually use Bitcoin, and of those who do, most convert instantly to fiat - leaving all the risk to the Bitcoin user, and essentially doing away with the whole point of Bitcoin (Bitcoin was meant to be used as an *alternative* to fiat, not in conjunction with it)
If merchants such as myself don't receive support, then Bitcoin has no value even as a medium of exchange, and therefore will inevitably become worthless. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:00:56
Bitcoin is already two or three of those things.
It would take some imagination, but I can think of something pretty quickly: Don't make it an inherently deflationary currency. Perhaps it could be stable, or inflationary, or remain deflationary with some other kind of function built in that guards against speculation.
If it's not possible, then it's not possible. But Bitcoin as it currently stands is flawed. These flaws I believe will end up in abandonment of the currency.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:00:01
This is hilarious
You can't realize a crash is happening until after the fact. 
And if it goes down 50%, you'll probably still be asking yourself 'is it going to go up again? should I cut my losses, or hold, or buy more?', and in that time it will have dropped even further.

Did you not read my post?
No surge of buyers is going to stop the price from crashing, because it's in a downtrend (highs lower than previous highs - we knew this for sure when it couldn't break $1242), because selling pressure will come in from higher levels of resistance, pushing the price down again.
I'll be sure to quote your post when the price goes under $500, and ask you again if you still think it 'isn't a crash'.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:41:56
To quote from myself before:
None of my assertions require evidence, OTHER THAN THE FOLLOWING CLAIMS:
- that there are 'Bitcoin millionaires'
- that (most) people have invested based on SPECULATION, including betting their life savings
I put the relevant words in caps, since it appears you have trouble comprehending my responses.
There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that the majority of Bitcoin users are speculating on it, but here is some more solid evidence:
Since early October, market capitalization has increased over 8-fold (source: 
Transaction volume however has only doubled. (source: 
It can be inferred from the disparity between these two figures that the majority of Bitcoins are being hoarded and are not being used in transactions.
Actual transaction value in BTC is also only just stable, further showing that Bitcoins aren't being used more despite the influx of capital (and even though there are more Bitcoins now!): 
It's crystal clear that speculation is the primary purpose of most users of Bitcoin at the moment. You'd have to have your head stuck in the sand to delude yourself to believe otherwise.

Not broadcast.com
It was at $0.25 in 1996, and $119 in 1999.
That's a 476x increase in 3 years.


Bitcoin didn't even have exchanges back then. Pizza is not even money.
If you want to play that game, you can say that broadcast.com cost about $35 for the domain name originally. It was acquired by Yahoo in 1999 for $5.7 billion.
That's an increase in value of near 163,000,000 times!

People here have been egging them on rather than discouraging them.
It is not just in their interest to discourage them I posit to you, it is also in the best interests of any Bitcoin holder who believes in Bitcoin as a currency, because inviting speculators only destroys the utility of the currency and could cause permanent damage to confidence in it which is crucial to it's success.


My context is that I've been actively discouraging people from speculating. I can sleep at night knowing I have not encouraged anyone to invest their retirement savings in a bubbling investment.
Hell, two weeks ago, I spent the time having a private conversation with someone here who actually was about to gamble his retirement savings on Bitcoin, in an active effort to discourage him from doing so.
Here's the thread:
Everyone should read that post, so that they know what the real effects of the popping of this bubble will be. This place is in [la-la land]( and it needs to be brought back down to Earth.

Yes, and it certainly isn't above $200


Scarcity does not automatically translate into value. I might have a rock that resembles the face of Elvis Presley, and it would probably be the only rock in the world like it. It still wouldn't be worth jack shit though.
By your logic, some of the altcoins which are more scarce than Bitcoin should now be worth more than Bitcoin.


Why? What does it matter, and what difference does it make?


That's my business, not yours, son.


Irrevelant. I, and most other businesses for that matter, want 100% fiat. We do not believe in Bitcoin and only want to extract money from the fools who use it without exposing ourselves to the financial risk.


Domestic bank deposit is free, but takes a day or two to receive funds.
International or domestic payment processing costs 2-3%, but is instantaneous.
A service such as Bitpay charges 1% or $30/month, and it takes a day or two to receive funds.

I've spoken to a guy on here who literally invested his retirement savings (or was planning to - I assume he did, unless he listened to me)
His attitude was essentially 'fuck it, I'll give it a shot. It's the only chance I'll get'.
I think a lot of people here are like that too, or worse. I've been involved in a bubble myself, years ago. I know what greed and excitement feels like. Until you go through the experience of it (luckily I didn't lose much), you can't really appreciate it.
A lot of the people invested in this Bitcoin bubble I feel are young and inexperienced. For instance, there are kids who are 15 or 17 posting here everyday 'how can I invest'. The majority are probably in their early 20s. Telling them 'only invest what you can afford to lose' is not something they'll understand, because they have no understanding of what it is to lose - nor do they understand what they're getting themselves into, and why they're far more likely to lose than win.
The saying 'only invest what you can afford to lose' is ill advice anyway, because it treats investing like gambling. Investing isn't gambling. That's not what it's meant to be.

No, I've applied the linear regression tool with a time period of 1200 days, and a channel with a standard deviation of 1 each side of the line. The computer does the calculations for me, not me.
You are probably just butthurt because you've recently lost ~50% in two days on your Bitcoin investment.
EDIT: As for the time-scale, I deliberately chose 1200 days, because that is about 99% of the entire history of the Bitcoin price - so be assured, you are getting an accurate portrayal of the mean, and not specific points in the data (i.e. as if I had just taken the year 1929 in the stockmarket, and applied linear regression just on that data)
As for the residual sum of squares (did you get confused by term, and word it wrong?), I don't see how it is relevant. Please explain what difference it would make, and why it is important to take into account in this case.

Speculation holds the consequence that the price goes up, but real transaction volume doesn't. In other words, the 'Bitcoin economy' doesn't grow despite the increased amount of capital involved.
This a problem for two reasons: The first is that Bitcoin is becoming more and more dependent on transaction fees as time goes on (as mining gains decrease), and the second is that the associated volatility with speculation severely hampers growth or even reduces participation/uptake in the Bitcoin economy (what merchant can safely operate with a currency that significantly fluctuates by the minute?). 
Those purely inside the closed system are not effected by this volatility, however they do face the uncertainty of the future of the currency by the jeopardized uptake (if confidence is lost and no one uses it, it becomes worthless). This is what Satoshi meant when he said 'the heat will destroy us' - a significant amount of bad publicity (which I will suggest to you, could include multiple bubble flash-crashes) could diminish the confidence in the currency which is crucial to it's uptake and thus long-term success.

Gold and fiat is significantly more protected than Bitcoin from the risks of loss and theft


What drug are you taking?
Precious metals and fiat are a hell of a lot less volatile at than Bitcoin, and you haven't refuted that


What's going to happen when Bitcoin is outlawed, and places like localbitcoins start being used for government sting operations (i.e. undercover officers)?
It would become like drug dealing, and thus would lose most of the userbase, and definitely any accountable business


Incorrect, the vast majority of people use centralized exchanges to buy shitcoins and have no other choice. These exchanges can be regulated and forced to hand over information, such as the passport photos people uploaded. Addresses and transactions are transparent, and thus can be tied to these entities dealing with the exchanges.


Incorrect, there currently exist other cryptocurrencies which have tried to address the problem of deflation by adding in set inflation of the currency even after the coins have all been mined
Plus there is room for future innovation here - which is another reason to avoid shitcoin, because it can be easily replaced by a better alternative that comes along.


What, you mean like Dogecoin which achieved a market cap of $14.3 million in less than two weeks?


Not if the company represented by the stock has any fundamental value to it. Thus why Enron stock was indeed a pyramid scheme. Bitcoin has no fundamental value other than a medium of exchange, and the possibility of that premise being true is looking less well founded by the day.


If there is no confidence is Bitcoin, it has no utility value. Thus why I say Bitcoin is going to zero in the long term, because it will inevitably be abandoned


I remember once getting a call late at night after I used my Visa card to make an online purchase. They suspected the transaction was unauthorized by me. They called within 5 minutes of my purchase, and they confirmed it immediately once I told them I had personally authorized it. 5-10 minutes all up, even with a mishap.


Well that's just a cumbersome disadvantage


Services like Square and Google Wallet allow you to transfer money instantly for free (no transaction fees).
The minimum transaction fee for Bitcoin is $0.07. That may not sound like much, but it is significant for microtransactions already. 
Worst of all, what will happen when the price reaches $10,000 say in a year's time as some here predict? 
That would make the minimum transaction fee $1, which is a significant amount for most regular transactions.
The Winklevoss twins predict $40,000/BTC, whilst the user 'georedd' here [predicts Bitcoin will reach $833,000 with 36 upvotes](
In the former case that would make the fee $4, and in the latter, $83.30.
Some people here think it is even too conservative to estimate the eventual value of Bitcoin at a figure in the thousands, rather than in the millions.
The people in this place are insane and high on the fruits of their speculation

This is because it's measuring **average deviation** and not difference in dollar numbers.
I only included the linear price chart for reference, so people could see what periods the volatility corresponds to exactly.

Don't worry bro, plenty of goys here will buy it up - they would sell their ass if was in support of Bitcoin

What price did you buy at, goy?

Yes, the problems I have with Bitcoin are the same problems I have with modern-day financial institutions. I thought these were the problems Bitcoin was meant to solve.
I'm not familiar with localbitcoins.com, but I assume the concept is that you trade one-on-one with other users. This doesn't solve any of the problems in my view. Sure, it likely to evade regulation and grant anonymity from government, but it barely compensates for the fact that you're more likely to be scammed or ripped off.
And what if the government criminalizes such private transactions? Then it will be no different from drug dealing essentially, where you have your 'local guy' who you can go to. 
Who in this hypothetical case will choose to go to the illegal, high-priced, unsafe source, when you can get it legitimately from a major exchange at the expense of your anonymity and accountability?
In order, these are my greatest concerns with Bitcoin:
1. Security
2. Anonymity
3. Regulation
4. Volatility
5. Other concerns
Volatility might as you say be temporal, and regulation might in some cases be useful/good, however when it comes to security and anonymity I feel these are both the most important aspects of Bitcoin and the ones that cannot be anything less than 'total'.
I think eventually volatility will die down, but not in a good way for Bitcoin. I think the end of volatility; of speculation, will signal the end of the system for the most part. Most people will lose faith, and those who seriously believe in it will have most likely moved on to a better alternative.

If you don't believe me, read this article:
Alipay and Tenpay have been contacted, and have all confirmed it's true. Even the PBOC have been [reportedly]( contacted and have confirmed it's true.
Judging by your account history, you have a vested interest in seeing the price of Bitcoin pushed up.

"they try to impress us with their erudition by spouting phrases like “decentralized peer to peer virtual ecosystems are the wave of the future” and warn we will be left behind and impoverished unless we pay $1000 for an encrypted string of code."
So true of this subreddit.

I don't believe in Bitcoin, but I would be willing to accept it for my business if I could get a guaranteed sum of fiat from it.
To avoid the up to ~50% intra-day volatility, I need a service that converts Bitcoin to fiat at point of sale, and not have some extremely risky condition like a minimum of $1000 in receipts before being allowed to cash out (even if you're a big business, use of Bitcoin is still very small, and you might not even get $1000 in sales).
The above is a problem that applies to me and many others I imagine, as I don't reside in the land of the free and the home of the brave.
I queried about this on here, and [it was suggested that one uses Coinjar]( 
This seemed suitable however it turns out there are two major caveats: the first that is one of the two guys that runs Coinjar ('Zhou Tong', real name Ryan Zhou) turns out to be a [known crook]( Bitcoinica, which he founded and ran, lost over 38,000BTC of customer's funds in 2012 and went into receivership. 'Zhoutonged' has even become a [popular phrase]( Soon afterwards, [he announced he was leaving Bitcoin forever]( however obviously he reneged on this and has came back.
And the second is that I setup my bank details two weeks ago and am still yet to be approved (in other words, nothing is even happening with this shady two-man show).
tl;dr Shitcoin is volatile as hell and is impossible to use for business

processing power =/= dollars invested
Processing power does cost dollars for electricity, but that's not money that's actually being invested - that's just money being used up and paid out for electricity usage.
Processing power costs are also insignificant
Back in the day when using a CPU or a GPU to mine Bitcoins, that would only use ~200-500W of power.
If you run 500W 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, that's still only $919.80, which wouldn't even pay for one Bitcoin at current prices. So it's fuck all, like I said.

The thing is, Bitcoin (and most, if not all, currently existing altcoins for that matter), has failed to achieve any of its supposed advantages over fiat currency.
Decentralization for instance is touted as one of the uncontroversial advantageous aspects of Bitcoin. Yet the exchanges are centralized, and most people have no choice but to use an exchange to get into Bitcoin. And this will not change in the future, because how the protocol works is already set in stone.
What a Bitcoin advocate tends to say in reply to this I've noticed is 'How are fiat exchanges any safer?', or something along those lines. They don't realize that they've abandoned the original point - that Bitcoin is meant to do away with the problem of centralization. Saying it's equal to fiat is no argument in it's favor.

Oh I think I see what you mean
But you see, the historical volatility instrument is already using a logarithmic scale. Why make it doubly so?
Volatility isn't supposed to go exponentially up with time you know, not even if it's Bitcoin. The 'average true range' does, because it works with the price numbers, but not historical volatility.
This is how the instrument is used as standard, and it's used to measure volatility, so I'd say it's designed for the job.
Either way, it would still show that we are in a rare period of high volatility compared to previous times.

I considered localbitcoins in my calculation
I looked at the exchange volume distribution, and found that localbitcoins sites are listed with relatively small amounts.
Though perhaps not all transactions end up being recorded, so I merely said 'MtGox accounts for 1 quarter of all exchange volume' - when in fact, it's quite a bit over a quarter. So even if localbitcoins accounted for more, it should balance out.


Mining died in 2011. Obviously there weren't many people to begin with, since Bitcoin was small at the time. By late 2011, even having an expensive consumer GPU wouldn't mine you very much at all, and I think that's when the multi-thousand-dollar ASICs first started coming out.


I daresay a lot of these people have overlap with exchanges. Excluding merchants, people probably have accounts on different exchanges, so the amount of uniques would probably be significantly smaller than 4 million.
So that would effectively cancel out any number of people who trade in Bitcoins, but don't have accounts with exchanges.


Probably about as many as on r/GirlsgoneBitcoin or whatever it was.. insigificant numbers of people I'd say
