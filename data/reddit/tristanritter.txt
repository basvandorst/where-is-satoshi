i've been called worse, i'll be fine. thanks again for your words of wisdom
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:34:34
haha what? i can post however and whenever i want. thanks for the advice though
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:51:17
chill out. i saw people got emails, and i usually get them from coinbase, but i haven't recieved one about this
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:39:45
what a fun day you have ahead of you. maybe get a job or something a bit more fulfulling
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:04:07
what is the TOTP secrets?
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:17:33
ah i see, is this just something foreign to the bitcoin community?
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:57:50
'google' and 'safe' do not fit in the same sentence regarding privacy.
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:24:56
well the nature in which i want to use it, it would be desirable to be able to do so every now and then. is that not something that's possible?
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:54:07
i have downloaded authy and have set it up for blockchain for the time being. i found out that my operating system doesn't enable google chrome updates anymore so i can't upgrade to the version that runs the software for the ledger nano s which has pissed me off. i am going to research into the trezor later to seenif i will have anymore luck with that.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:28:42
thanks alot, i'll get on it right away
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:09:29
i use a smartphone. an android with the blockchain app. does that make a difference?
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:53:33
explain to me how they can do that please? authy doesn't know my phone number. regardless, it's better than using sms authorisation. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:10:16
i use totp on authy
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:10:18
thansk for the advice. can you reccommend any wallets?
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:08:57
do research first? before what? i commented saying 'that's why i use authy'. because authy is more secure than sms authorisation. get off your high horse mate. well done, you know more than me. instead of being a dickhead, how about helping someone out. you have just as much power to do that as to be a dickhead.
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:09:20
i'm really sorry, i'm not sure i understand
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:18:43
why i use authy
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:11:58
okay great. and on the contrary, if i plan on just storing an amount of bitcoin for (hopefully) future growth i should store in on a hardware wallet? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:52:25
brilliant, that's very clear. this is definitely a dumb question but does the value of the bitcoin still fluxuate the same stored in a hardware wallet than say it being stored on the  blockchain app?
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:31:33
ah okay, i get the same codes on authy. just didn't know they were called totp. is it 'time sensitive, one time passwords' or somethng like that i just read
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:57:57
so i'm thinking i'll get the trezor too after a bit of research. just a quick question about it. does it have a function to be able to withdraw my bitcoin to a bank account? that's something i'm very unclear about in general and seems like a pretty scarce feature on all the wallets i looked at. sorry for asking, i looked through r/bitcoinbeginners and couldn't see anything.
