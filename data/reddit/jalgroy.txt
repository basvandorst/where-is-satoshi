That's true, didn't think about that. But I checked the recent blocks now, and the second one was mined in &lt; 1 Minute, so I guess it got 2 confirmations rapidly.
It wasn't a problem with blockchain.info, as the coinbase invoice I was paying did'nt see the transaction either.

Bitcoin core requires you to keep the entire blockchain on your computer (&amp;gt;15GB), and shouldn't be used unless you keep your computer on 24/7. I recommend  electrum if you want to use a desktop wallet. It uses a 12 word seed that you can write down and keep in a safe place,  and will recover your wallet if you were to delete it or lose it in some way. The user interface is a little ugly,  but it works very well.
And btw, I trust my Android more than my windows pc ,  but I guess it depends on your use. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 11:59:40
I'm seriously loving this volatility. Watching the price soar $10 in seconds and falling back down again just as fast. And knowing that those $10 equates to thousands for some people. I'm invested myself (with what is a small amount to most people), but I knew what I was getting into, and love calculating how much I gained or lost in the past hours.
It should be noted that my ROI is a bit lower than we currently are, so people that are in the red may not have the same experience.

Good, they're paying attention.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:34:26
It's accurate, but they don't measure hashrate, the chart shows who mined the blocks in the last 24 hours. So p2pool mined ~1% of the blocks in the last 24 hours, indicating they have about 1% of the hashrate. Longer timespans will show a more accurate represantation of hashrate distribution.

Well,  if you were to buy 30 000 coins on the market, you would eat through the order books really fast and end up with an average price much higher than the current spot price. Thus,  it's not unreasonable that someone would pay a good premium for such a big bundle off-market.

$1M times 21M total bitcoins is $21 Trillion market cap (a little less as not all bitcoins have been mined). There is about 1.25 trillion US dollars in circulation, so the $1 million price assumes Bitcoin becomes several times more valuable than the US dollar. I'm guessing the people predicting such a price is seeing bitcoin becoming the next global reserve currency.

MacBooks are great IMO. They don't have the same restrictions an iPhone does, as you can install any sowftware you wish on it, and even run any operating system on it. I highly prefer mac over any windows pc, even though I'm a total IT-nerd, mostly because of how stable the system is, and also because my productivity skyrocketed after switching. It's just more intuitive.

That makes sense I guess. My node currently has 72 connections, so in theory I relay transactions ~10 times more efficient than a node without ports opened? 
@_date: 2014-05-18 18:12:32
Short answer: No. Long answer: Possibly, for example if there is someone who has access to both Coinbase and Krakens internal records. Also, if you know one address a person owns, you can track movements and with a somewhat high probability determine which transactions go to addresses owned by the same person

I really do not understand the hostility between dogecoin and bitcoin. I am a member of both communities, and I see no reason they can't co-exist. Dogecoin is fun, and it is an amazingly positive community, but we all know that dogecoin will never become the de facto cryptocurrency. Bitcoin on the other hand, is the future. Bitcoin needs to appeal to a larger crowd, including boring finance people and non-tech communities to succeed. Because of this, it is obvious that a more serious discussion about important matters need to happen in this subreddit. Just lay down your weapons, please.

Oh, I see. Does this in any way interfere with the decentralized concept behind p2pool, or is it irrelevant how many people run their own nodes? (I see that it's better than a regular pool either way, just wondering how it affects things)

You can sign a message with your private key (you can do it in a blockchain.info-wallet and in the reference wallet). Anybody with the encrypted message and your address can then verify that you signed it with the private key corresponding to the address.

Sadly I think we'll see "average users" resort to services like Coinbase and Circle. But for those who decide to hold their own coins I think hardware wallets like trezor might have the best combination of security and ease of use.

Because it is a full node, wich is supposed to help the network, and unless it is running most of the time and you have set up port forwarding on port 8333, you will use the network resources instead of helping it.

The trading feature allows localbitcoins-like trading straight from the app. When you start a trade with someone nearby, you get a private chat where you can arrange location and time, then you meet up, exchange cash, and the seller releases the bitcoins.

Exchanges should be used for just that - exchanging.


^ This is the definition of an offchain, centralized system. As I understand it users can use this as a "wallet" where they hold your coins for you.

I would say just buy bitcoin instead. By the time you get it shipped, the bitcoin price might have risen enough to already make it a better investment. However you could have more luck mining, but currently I think a direct investment is a better idea.

But why is that better? The thing is, with a set block reward the inflation would be both predictable and stable. Wouldn't that keep the advantages of the current system without removing the incentive for mining?
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:00:51
I would rather say it's affected by the stability of the price. If the price fluctuates, the quality goes down. If the price is stable, the quality goes up

That is exactly why you should protect your bitcoins with physical security instead of digital, by moving them to an offline wallet.

If we say 5 billion ounces of gold has been mined in human history (low estimate). 1 millionth of all gold mined would be 5000 ounces, or ~$6 million.

This worked, thanks :) 
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:21:54


What? It's publicly traded, so anyone can buy their stock.

Do you do this full time?

Hmm, I was asked for a password when displaying the seed, so I know I have the right password for the wallet. Problem is I'm not prompted for a password when signing a transaction.

The total increase from Nov 2013 to Dec 2013 was 10,962,499 addresses. The increase in addresses containing 0-0.001 BTC in the same period was 10,548,167. 
So I think you can mostly attribute that increase to blockchain spam, faucets etc. - not actual adoption.
@_date: 2015-10-18 12:29:30
Anyone know what block that happened in? 
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:12:23
Why does the bitcoin rich list claim [19KJZ5aqWnrrCaNAS5Pbd4uknPFBxjALRt]( is the richest address? When you check it out on [blockchain.info]( it has 0.0045 BTC.

I wouldn't trust that it's actually someone from Circle

The tip goes through anyway, it's just that the bot cannot reply with the verification comment.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:37:55
I already did. No response..
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:23:27
Great! Now let's hope Norway does the same thing.
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:55:56
Are there any iPhone apps that does this? Can't do it in the blockchain.info app
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:16:14
Well yeah it's the buisness that has to pay 25% tax, but that obviously means they will have to raise the price by 25% to be able to sell btc

6% of 1004 people tought an xbox game was the most probable alternative.

It's one of the worst Norwegian accents I've heard, but pretty much everyone above 40 years in Norway speak English somewhat like this..

Oops, my wallet was compromised..
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:35:01
Awesome! I hope my little pack of coins will buy me something like this in a few years
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:05:05
And then, an Indian exchange appears, and the process happens all over again
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:52:28
The thing with Norway is that they have said you have to pay 25% VAT (or norwegian equivalent) on any bitcoin purchase. This means you have to pay $125 for $100 worth of bitcoin. This should not be the case. However, I believe they will change stance on this if there is a case on it in a federal court.
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:43:05
You haven't added [Justcoin]( a Norwegian exchange.
