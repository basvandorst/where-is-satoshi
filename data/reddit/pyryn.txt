No kidding? That sounds pretty brutal, I'm sorry to hear it. I hope you're successful now

I'm considering investing in litecoin, considering how low it is right now. Not sure if that would be as good an idea, but who knows?

That's true? BTC-E looks very, very Russian. Obviously. Depositing money though--$500 minimum? Rough. Do you use BTC-E or Bitstamp?

Well I didn't sell immediately after I started losing money. Once the price dropped from my initial purchase price I held onto it for another 3 months before selling, and it never rose. Almost immediately (a week) after I sold them they rose though. I don't have the best luck with these sort of things.

TECHNICALLY I made about $147, let's not cut me short here! But I didn't need the $147 at the time. I was just worried about the price dropping, and being a college student, figured I might as well withdraw while it was safe. So...fml, basically.

Pretty impossible thing to imagine. I don't think anyone two to three years ago would have ever pictured this happening, and it's honestly just beautiful to see. It's like, regular people making tons of money as a complete departure from the stranglehold of banks and the stock market.

Right?! I'm just waiting to get verified with Mt. Gox right now so I can start the whole process... Do you have another exchange you might recommend instead?
