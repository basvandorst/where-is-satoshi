They're basically the current equivalent of beanie babies. Mass produced collectibles that retail quite cheaply, with a big resale market because they're constantly moving on to new stuff and leaving the old figures behind. Funko seems to have its hands in nearly every franchise too, there isn't much that hasn't been Funko'd at this point. A ton of other competitors have jumped into the market too, but none nearly as successful (LEGO Brickheads are my favorite, because when I'm tired of them I can disassemble them and do other things with the pieces).
And eventually, something else will come along, and the market will crash hard, and everyone's ridiculous cheap figures will be practically worthless.

That's fair, the industry (or at least most of it) did learn from Beanie Baby's mistakes. Here's hoping it doesn't happen again!

I would also assume that it's pretty low, but I think there's a big difference between getting a figure or two you really like and buying a bunch of them as an investment. I don't want to unintentionally rain on somebody's parade, the figures can be cool, as long as you're happy with them as collectibles. The guy talking about how much he made off of them was a lucky early adopter.

I mean, it's the wrong sub, but it's also a fun game. If you like other tactical turn-based combat games, or if that sounds like something you'll enjoy, then it's definitely for you.

Have you been to r/wallstreetbets? That's basically their whole thing.
