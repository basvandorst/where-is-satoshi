Oh, snap! / example only dude, pick any other currency, but the BTC/non$ pair needs to be reversed to allow the community to feel comfortable with 9 digits and see more clearly inflation of their home currency. Also, having multiple currency pairs on an exchange could allow you to trade currency for BTC price disparity.

"The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity." - Satoshi Nakamoto
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:40:29
"First, let’s address the idea that cryptocurrencies aren’t real money. In today’s digital age, all money is really just numbers on a computer. Yes, you can have cash in your pocket, but most of us use credit cards and online banking for most of our activities. And when you’re making a purchase with a credit card, you’re just moving numbers from one account to another. And at its core, that’s exactly what cryptocurrency does. It moves lines of code from one wallet to another.
But then people will argue that there is nothing backing this currency. Well, in truth, since the US left the gold standard in the 1930’s the only thing backing other currencies is the general consensus created around its value. So, again, the cryptocurrencies have value, just like any other currency, as long as people agree that they have value.
So, the most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created in 2009 and it is the most widely used and trusted cryptocurrency on the market. Right now it’s value is roughly $4,500 per coin. And yes, each coin can be broken down into smaller units, so don’t fret that you’d need to come up with $4,500 to invest in bitcoin. You can do that for tiny amounts of money."

"What does this mean? For finance-types in Canada, it means that you can buy a stake in a pool of bitcoin managed by First Block Capital. As the bitcoin appreciates in value, the value of your stake will go up in turn. The target audience for this scheme is people who want to invest in Bitcoin like a commodity—say, steel or oil—and sit back while it (ideally) becomes more valuable. That way, they don’t have to worry about the nitty gritty, including private keys and exchanges, or even how Bitcoin works, frankly. The point is the profit."

Bitcoin is backed by beanie babies, hodling tulips wrapped in a bubble...is what I'm going to start telling people to get them excited about bitcoin.
This is the stored value of bitcoin people have been asking about.
昔々, after having too many of these items in boxes at her house, Satoshi figured out a way to trade them electronically. Why send someone beanie babies physically, if they could just hold the value of it on their digital wallet, which they could then trade for other goods and services? Because all these items had now reached a stable price, packaging them together was the best way to back a stable digital currency.
Of course because beanie babies, tulips, and bubbles are in the news again, bitcoin is rising because more people want these assets in their portfolio.

"At present the main reason why blockchain technology hasn’t been embraced on a greater commercial level is quite simply down to trust and understanding. People don’t know what cryptocurrencies are, how to attain them, where they can be used, and whether or not they can be trusted. But like any new technology all it will take is for a few legitimate, trusted retailers to embrace them and their value will increase. Fundamentally, cryptocurrencies will eventually overtake cash, that’s no longer up for debate; but when it will happen... that’s anyone’s guess."
