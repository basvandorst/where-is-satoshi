That's fair enough.  I don't see it quite the same way; it appears to me this perception of Assange is largely the result of the lens you look through.  I am a US citizen but don't really consider that US citizens should be held above citizens of other countries, including Russia.
It seems to me Assange has done good for the average citizen of the world; though he is clearly not perfect.

Sorry, I should have been more explicit.  You want to send the same transaction from the electrum wallet that you sent from your other wallet but with a higher fee; you really need to be careful though since it's possible you send a different tx with a higher fee and then the other one still eventually verifies; if you are sending more than half the total coins available int he wallet it won't be an issue, otherwise you need to make sure you are spending the same  utxo.

What wallet did you use to send it?  You can just create a duplicate transaction with higher fee (from a protocol standpoint) but many wallets don't expose that functionality.

Consider that any problem can be reworded in such a way where the only possible hypothesis is either "yes" or "no".
Does *X* happen for some complex reason *Y*?
There is no "yes"/"no" type question in science in the way you are describing (or if you prefer, every potential inquiry is a yes/no question).
To use your elephant example, a scientist would not ask a question like, "do elephants always land on their feet?" they would ask, "how do elephants fall?".  Then a hypothesis might be, "they always land on their feet", at which point a scientist may drop an elephant as an experiment in as many fashions as possible until (presumably) an elephant does not land on its feet.
At this point they would have disproved their hypothesis, and moved onto another.

They suffered several hacks and a default from arumxchange; which was released via their quarterly 'reports'.  They stated they were covering losses from income, they've actually said this multiple times.  I looked briefly but couldn't find the exact pdf that listed it, but it was not news to me that they were not fully backed.
As far as why they processed a large withdrawal... it's hard to say.  Maybe it was a friend, maybe there wasn't a large withdrawal but rather it just finally became unsustainable.

It is open to the public, it's called propping.  It's less well known, and props have to start tables as a rule so it's not exactly the same.  
Clearly if your site becomes a stars or ft the 100% rakeback will be worth far more than what it costs now.
Realistically that is a very very small likelihood.  If you get your funding, then gj and good luck.  If not, well take my feedback to heart because new sites are a dime a dozen, and if I were going to invest in one, I would want profit sharing.

when you do

you are just putting the files into a system accessible place that will be in the $LIBRARY_PATH
so you will need to update the environment variable that is used for looking for libraries (not sure what it is), or, manually move the library to somewhere it will search (which will always be the current directory of the file asking for the library)

The reality is that there is incredibly good open source software; theymos should have considered (probably did) using it.
That being said; theymos did hodl through more bubbles than 90% posting in this thread experienced. 
The money was donated for forums software; if theymos legit picked bad-ass '20 somethings' to write forum software from an idealic vantage point; the world will be a better place for it.
Theymos is in an awkward position; he himself is rich beyond anything the effort put forth actually would seemingly entitle him; additionally he is in custodian to an awkwardly-enormous sum donated with a specific notion in mind.
As a software company founder, as an early bitcoin adopter (here is me talking about bitcoin almost hitting $1  and as a philosopher; I see theymos as a person whom, long before almost anyone here tasted the bitcoin cream; is long divorced from conceptual reality wmoney and alliance.
Theymos could run away with all this cash and shaking a stick at him is the best you could do.  It might be better spent directly feeding starving people, *discourse* is the the (imho) epitome of forum software for 2014-2015; and generally there are a million more-ideal choices theymos could have made.
That being said; theymos is obviously legit (or straight-up NSA.. in which case.. kudos you mother fuckers); I support influencing his decision to spend the money in good ways.
But, I have to .. as someone who has never spoken a direct word to him, give theymos his due.  It's hard to imagine the enormously irregular happenstance theymos finds himself in; and he is doing at least decent.
On the most general note: the best developers are always in their twenties.. confidence of youth a decade of practice, a healthy distaste for the status quo.  A top-tier dev can get 300k easy.. if theymos thought he was good; it's a fair market price.

Probably nothing will happen.  It's unlikely anyone snooped his identity unless there were some hacks that I am not aware of.  
He could potentially get caught with network analysis of the coins in escrow, if there is a coordination among the fucked consumers/dealers to expose their deposit and withdrawal addresses, then, if the coins ever make it to an exchange where there is an attempt to go from crypto-&gt;fiat they could sniff him/her/them out that way.

Maybe you misunderstood.. the core thing .. at least as where as our understandings seem to be different..
`Diff1` = `372` does not mean that you found 372 hashes of Diff1 or higher.  It means you have found N hashes whose *total* difficulty = 372.
So I do not believe your minor is 'holding back hashes'; rather your `Accepted` = `11` means that you have found a *total* of 11 hashes which count as valid shares.  If you add up the value of those 11 hashes, they all add up to your diff1.
@_date: 2014-01-01 21:58:32
well it's more than that it is "just a gambling site"; a lot of people consider their model a DDoS against bitcoin; as they are abusing and unnecessarily inflating the size of the blockchain.  
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:48:24
Diff1 is easiest.
Let's do some math.
We can see that of the 11 shares found, the best one was `Diff = 132`; and.. luckily for us.. your most recent one was `Diff = 32`.  That gets us up all the way to 
    132 + 32 = 164
However you also have `Disc = 14` so we have to remove that from the Diff1
    164 - 14 = 150
You have 11 total Accepted shares, and we have accounted for 2 of them (Dlast and best)
  11 - 2 = 9
We have 9 shares un accounted for and 18 `diff1` to account for; so an average of diff2 for the remaining 9 shares when you account for the 132 and 32.
This seems well within statistical expectation, no?

Are you seriously going to deny that hijacking has accepted usage beyond stealing a vehicle?
I did not claim anyone stole my money.  My claim is that they are forcing users to sign up for things they don't need to sign up for.  It *is* evil.
The use of 'evil' and 'hijacking' are both well-established vocabulary terms wsoftware.  google, for example.. 'evil software design'  to see many uses
An 'evil' action is an action that is bad for the user and good for the company.  When you sell user info to third parties, that is evil.  When you force users to refer friends to use your app, that is evil.  When a user attempts to send an email to someone with a bitcoin address and amount, and instead you send an email requiring them to sign up with your service, that is evil.
If you don't like the word 'evil' or the word 'hijacking' here; that is fine but it is purely semantic (and established well beyond this little reddit post).  In any case, it is a dishonest practice that hurts the user (albeit slightly) for the benefit of the company.

the argument is that there is a psychological barrier to less than a bitcoin.  even if you say "here are 100 mbits".. and someone asks, "cool! how much bitcoin is that?"  "it's .1 bitcoin" may still be a dissapointing answer: reason being that people *primarily* think in btc; rather than mbits.

well sort of.  the torrent is popular and linked to from many places, and highly seeded.. so it is extremely unlikely for a 'false' one to 'seem real' but a motivated attacker could potentially generate a bunch of seeds.
however, your client does verify the the proof of work, so it would be a tremendous amount of time and energy to even generate a 'fake' one, though they could just fake the last few hundred blocks i guess; but even so it has to be timed so damn perfectly otherwise your client will just pick the longest chain anyway and orphan the evil chain.
to successfully trick you into thinking you have a balance that you actually don't have; they would have to create a chain longer than the real chain (hard since proof of work is *proof* of work); then, they also need to trick your client to connecting to evil nodes; probably by MITM you; as a whole ton of 'real' evil nodes just on the network would be noticed almost instantly by the community.  THEN they would have to actually send you a transaction that seems real and get you to actually do something because of it, like hand them over other keys on the real chain or give them a briefcase of money or some key bit of information; and all of this has to happen before the real chain outpaces the evil chain.
even with all of that, it is pretty trivial to manually connect to a couple well known nodes (ie blockchain.info) and get their peers.
so, basically:  tl;dr:  yes it's possible but extremely difficult, very unlikely adn would be very expensive to do, so they would only do it if you had a LOT to lose, and if you had a lot to lose you would just take basic precautions that would defeat the attack anyway.

2. weed does grow with light 24 hours a day and only needs to cycle during the flowering stage
3. a medium sized operation will have several rooms, some will be cycling, some will be constant

No.. paper wallets are literally more secure.  
Even if I did have a trezor; I would not use it store my main stash.. I would still hold the majority on paper.  As a hot wallet it is one of the more secure options, but I am skeptical that it is somehow 'more secure' than say, the HW-1 which is 1/10th the price
@_date: 2014-11-30 00:18:38
trezor is just unreasonably expensive; even at 3for2 (do I really need 3 of these fucking things?) they are stil $80/each

I believe what is happening is that `diff1` does not mean what you think it does.
Now, I am not sure.. but from your screenshot I read something like:
Your miners found a total of 11 hashes which counted as shares.
However, some of those hashes were "worth more" than other hashes.  For example if you found a 10-diff share, and a 37diff share.. you would have
Acc: 2
diff1: 47
That being said; the only way to increase the rate would either to give an honest simulation of 'satoshis earned / minute', or, get a more powerful miner.
More information:


I think you don't actually want this.. the specific answer to that query would probably be "discard all shares that are worth more than diff1".. which would be a terrible strategy!


Essentially a call to to the mining pool to "get the work" that the hashers are going to jump on.  


Generally this would mean that the hashes are stale; your miners produced (generally at the fault of latency) shares for the wrong "getwork" (loosely speaking).


This is the most confusing.  You have discarded shares; which would happen if you were mining at a difficulty higher than 1.. there is probably an explanation.. it might be that you have your miner thinking it is working in a higher difficulty than it really is?


My understanding is that this is essentially the total work you have done in `diff1` units.

600 bucks for 100% rake back on one account and no profit sharing.. I wonder if you had a poker consultant.  You are excluding usa players, and, do you realize as a prop I can get &gt;100% rake back and not pay anything up front?
I can't imagine a more ideal customer than myself.  I used to play poker for a living, I'm a long time Crypto nerd.. But your crowd sale offering is just a ridiculous proposition.  One can get free rake or better on tiny sites anyway, and any other poker nerd knows it.. And I would laugh my ass off if they asked for money up front, let alone 2btc.
As an American I might consider it if I could play safely there, but your one possible edge you are throwing out the door by making me link social accounts.
Good luck, but this is pretty poorly thought out IMO.
I would need
1.  To feel safe as an american
2. To get fair revenue sharing not linked to a single account that only amounts to free rake, which is readily available on any number of tiny sites for free.  
The idea that a token holder will get a high raking customer on their account is just ridiculous.. As any high raking player will be savvy enough to either get their own token or demand nearly all the rake back to themselves.
I wish you guys luck, and I LOVE the reduced counterparty risk with instant buyins, but everything else just tells me you guys arent aware of the existing ecosystem or you think your customers are stupid.

What does this have to do with anything?  
This has nothing to do with them releasing bitcoin *to* anonymous users.  It's about their existing, non-anonymous users requesting to be paid by using a button that coinbase provides.
In fact, I have an email from coinbase stating that their reason for doing this is because they feel that it is easier for new comers to never see a bitcoin address; and that they will consider maybe possibly adding the ability to 'unhide' the bitcoin address for the non-newcomers.
This is not about sending money from my coinbase account to some anonymous user (which they do all the fucking time anyway when I send bitcoin to any arbitrary address from coinbase anyway); but about an existing user asking someone to send them bitcoin.
It is 
anonymous -&gt; Coinbase user
where you are saying they cannot do
Coinbase user -&gt; anonymous
Which is hilarious because they actually do
Coinbase user -&gt; anonymous
Everytime I just send bitcoin from my coinbase account

Sort of, yes.  There is a relatively small group of core devs and a much larger group of fringe devs and watchers and every change is debated hotly before going into the code.
I encourage you to check out the issue queue in the bitcoin-qt github repo to see what I mean.  I understand where you are coming from with there being a lot of power in the devs; but the reality of the situation is that things are not 'snuck' in, the code is scoured by many, many people looking for flaws, and there is a tremendous amount of conversation happening about every protocol change.
You are right that very few people are able to understand what is going on relative to the number of people that are actually using the code; but it isn't a stark line like you seem to be implying/thinking.
It's really a lot closer to a 'congress' or 'house of representative' type model, where there are tons of people with varying ability to understand what is going on and intermingling and their thougths ideas trickle into the larger community, packaged and repackaged for everyone's understanding.  It's all adhoc for sure, but, the reality of the situation is actually easy to just look at: it's simply not the case that some small group of people are injecting whatever they like into bitcoin and everyone just blindly runs it.
Your concern is smart, but if you just take some time to check out bitcointalk.org, the bitcoin issue queue, and spend sometime in  you will see that it is a much, much more democratic situation than you seem to believe.

This isn't *quite* right, although, you would probably see the behavior that phishers could use to exploit your users.
Consider the value of a coinbase specific phishing attack on a random email address; as an expected return that the spammer will see per email address.  
Because they are sending out so many emails it is pretty likely they will get caught by spam filters, so even the emails that get to actual coinbase users are pretty unlikely to even be seen in the first place. 
On the otherhand, if one had a way to pre-validate coinbase user email addresses, they could put more time and energy into each email address, and, by doing it much slower, they would have a much higher chance of bypassing spam filters and getting into someone's inbox.
The key fault of your argument is


The reality is that each email a spammer sends out has an increasing marginal cost *and* decreasing marginal value.  I'm not saying anyone is necessarily even doing it; but it definitely *is* exploitable.
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:38:27
it is no where close to the same amount of risk.  bitcoin could have been squashed like a bug in 2011; bitcoin wasn't a household name even in tech/financial circles.

To be safe you should use bitaddress.org in an offline mode (load the site onto a USB drive and boot into a ubuntu live-cd or something).
The polaroid camera aspect is fine; but you run some risk of having your address scraped in a non-secure system.
@_date: 2015-05-26 13:10:02
Well I have no idea, but this has nothing to do with bitcoin.  There are billions of computer servers living on the internet attempting to remain secure.
Main strategies are: no root ssh access, cert-only ssh access, regular security updates, security audits, firewalls, port knocking, modularity.
Considering the damage that could be done accessing the stuff they have even without the bitcoin keys; it seems like something they probably take very seriously.

Approximately nine months ago, we received a strange message on reddit from a user that had information regarding shilling that was taking place on the site.
 
It wasn’t the first time our reddit account had received a strange and almost cryptic-like message, and it certainly wouldn’t be the last time we saw someone declaring that paid shills and trolls existed specifically in the bitcoin subreddit.
 
At the time, Mike was the primary person behind Coin Fire and was overwhelmed with following a few leads regarding bitcoin merchant acceptance, so he left the message unread and without reply for several weeks. When I asked him why the message was left in the reddit inbox with nary a response for such a long time, he told me,
 
At the time, it was just me deciding where to spend resources and time. I was traveling, working on improving the site, and following a few other story leads. I chalked it up to a trolling itself and didn’t think anything of it.
 
Eventually, Mike responded to the message stating that he would be open to chatting about what the person behind the statements had to say.
 
[Inbox Photo](
 
Believing that the story opportunity had passed, Mike noted that he hadn’t received a response on BitMessage several weeks later and considered it to be a dead lead.
 
It wasn’t until several months later when a BitMessage came in and was signed by the reddit user that the potential of a story even appeared on Coin Fire’s radar. The message stated that the person on the other end wanted to make sure we could be trusted to protect his or her identity, and that they would slowly begin passing us the relevant details about the company that employed them and the extent of shilling and trolling on the bitcoin subreddit specifically.
 
Over the next several months, the person on the other end would provide information to our series of highly skeptical questions regarding the operations in which they were involved. We later learned they were part of relatively small team after learning about the job via a friend.
 
With each set of questions and answers, it seemed that what was being shared with our team was real, but the level of skepticism was still high amongst Coin Fire team members. It wasn’t until months later that the person we were communicating with opened up more and began providing further shreds of evidence.
 
“Ted” claims to control over 100 reddit accounts, but we’ve been provided evidence that only 50 or so are truly under his control. The reddit accounts he is using all have long posting histories, and each have some account length and all appear completely legitimate from a first glance. Some of the accounts were started by other members of the reddit community initially and later purchased by his employer for use in his work.
 
The accounts all have “vast interests” and many of them are members of the subreddit, but they also contain comments and postings in several other subreddits. Many of the accounts started off primarily on a different subreddit and eventually found themselves on Oftentimes, these accounts pose as new users of the cryptocurrency or as people who are experts in other fields of banking or technology.
 
Some of the accounts have been crafted by Ted himself or others on his team, and attention has been paid to keep track of the various accounts, the personas created around them, and even details such as “acceptable times” to post. All accounts are shared in a system designed to help posters keep track of important details and make sure the illusion of genuine accounts is maintained.
 
The level of detail put behind the maintenance of accounts, personas, and posting times shows that the operation has established itself and is likely well-funded.
 
[Dashboard for “Disruption”](
Ted shared his system with Coin Fire via a TeamViewer connection and spoke at length with our team about how the system works when it comes to reddit. Ted works from his home and a great emphasis is placed on following “rules. The “DisruptDictator” system is locked to his specific IP addresses for access and contains several logging systems for his activity inside the dashboard from his employer. His Internet connection was in no way monitored and thus our team had free range to poke around with Ted, but his paranoia was high as he walked our team through several aspects of his daily job all the while requesting we protect his identity and that of the company he contracts for.

Yes and no.  In both cases they aren't showing a btc address when they should be.  In the android case though the address is actually available though, albeit only as a qr code.  This is what they said was an oversight, and this is what they said they will fix.
Forcing users to sign up to see requested payments is a different matter entirely, is not an accident, and they have no intention of changing it (based on my email thread with them)

I presume you mean the fact that you can't get a bitcoin address in the android app.  It makes sense this is an oversight.
However, I find it hard to believe that *when someone requests bitcoin be sent to them, to a non-registered-with-you email address, and instead of sending an address, **you force a user to sign up***, has anything at all to do with android.  
In fact, I am basically 100% positive it has nothing to do with Android.  Can you please confirm/deny whether or not you will change the straight-up-evil user acquisition technique you are using here?

I don't get this line of thinking?  Obviously if you don't like them, don't use them.  Does that imply that people shouldn't speak up if they *do* like them, but don't like something they are doing?
Why so black and white?  
I like coinbase, at least I did.  And I want to.  What I don't want is for them to go down a path of more and more evil UX.  This is a very minor (in the grand scheme of things) dick move on their part, but is *is* a dick move. 
It fundamentally shows a deviation from treating their customers with utmost respect.  They take a clear user intent, and instead of carrying out the intent (and only the intent) they use it as a mechanism to acquire users.  This is a classic technique; it's relatively, but not completely harmless.

I suggest you read the bitcoin whitepaper to understand why people cannot steal bitcoin without having access to your private keys.
Computer security in general is beyond the scope of a reddit comment, but my guess is that end users will not store their own private keys for these securities but will instead be executed in a similar fashion to they way they are now (and nasdaq will have to protect their servers in exactly the same way they do today, or anyone else in the world does to keep attackers outside of their machines).

While Ted understands his employer can see the traffic indicating a remote connection when he is connected via a VPN provided by his employer, he believed it to be safe.
 
Ted logs into the reddit accounts via a VPN. Different accounts are marked to use different VPN connections to make them appear further legitimate to reddit administrators.
 
The system uses a Twitter bootstrap UI so it sizes down and can be “docked” in a browser window while the bulk of the work will take place in the larger window. Ted surfs to a thread using specific instructions to find it for disruption. From interactions with the dashboard, it becomes evident it is powered by Microsoft .NET and ASP.NET.
 
Ted explains that early on, the developers of the Disrupt dashboard realized that using links would leave referral links to the sites they intend to disrupt. While they had the dashboard locked to specific IP addresses, it wouldn’t take long for site administrators to understand what was happening. The next iteration contained text with a URL that people such as Ted would copy and paste in to a browser, but the reddit administrators would eventually see direct linking and then voting as a potential means for disruption. In an effort to make sure the traffic and actions seem as organic as possible, each person will move to the particular thread using instructions telling them how to find the same thread that the “pitcher” throws at them.
 
Ted’s day is simple. He spends approximately eight hours online each day with an hour lunch period. He only uses the dashboard in one window to determine where he will go next and makes efforts to disrupt. Sometimes he is directed to create new posts that will paint bitcoin reddit users in negative ways.
 
“Sometimes, I just have to go and make an anti-female post or something that makes bitcoin users look bad,” Ted tells us.
 
Ted explains that when he first started, he was given plenty of reading material. His first week, he was given limited access to the dashboard that contained a myriad of content that would teach him the basic ropes on how he would be disrupting online conversations or communities. Ted’s assignment was primarily reddit disruption, so he became familiar with the top users in the subreddits he would be tasked with disrupting.
 
Learning about the top posters in the bitcoin subreddit has allowed Ted to understand the viewpoints of the users. As he is engaging them, he is tasked with entering details on the dashboard about those particular users. If he has seen a piece of information in a comment about the geographic location of a particular user for example, he will enter it on the dashboard notes so he or other users can refer to it later.
 
Ted is technically an independent contractor who is paid each week. Ted has been working as an independent contractor for this company for approximately a year. When Ted started his new “career path,” he was making roughly $8 per hour but has since moved up to the $10 an hour level. He understands that eventually he can become a “pitcher” or someone who tosses new stories and areas that need disruptions to the “hitters” such as himself and make approximately $15 an hour.
 
His weekly checks come from an extensive range of company names. Ted shared several of the canceled checks with the Coin Fire team who then explored the company names and registrations from various states. We found that the companies exist on paper within different states, but that other details, such as addresses, are typically mail drop locations or other postal type boxes.
 
None of the canceled checks contained names of companies that had any sort of Internet presence so finding out further information outside of what is available in state filings was difficult. The “leading group” behind the entire operation likely paying the smaller companies for services is completely hidden.
 
An ever-changing check signer makes it more difficult for Ted to find new work. While technically a “consultant” on paper and to friends and family, he can’t offer his employer up on a resume or job applications. It appears to potential employers from the outside that Ted has been virtually unemployed for the last year.
 
Over the last several months, Ted has provided check statements, banking statements, messages from various shill accounts on reddit, access to his machine via TeamViewer, and provided names of the ever-changing company he performs work for.
 
When we asked Ted who his company represents, he admitted that he wasn’t entirely sure. He speculates it isn’t a government, but rather private companies that are paying the “home base” who in turn are paying the team behind the disruption. He has only spoken with a handful of people he works for on brief telephone conversations. He stated he was aware of at least one “pitcher” defecting and confessing on reddit one time as his dashboard showed one day the need to disrupt the conversation.
 
Who is behind the trolling and disruption isn’t clear, but whether or not it is having an impact at times has been clear as Ted showed us threads where the entire conversation had been steered another way by his efforts.
 
We asked Ted if he would continue working and disrupting online conversations. He said that he understands he may get fired if his identity is exposed because of this piece and is ready to accept that outcome, but would make no efforts on his own to quit until he has found another job that can pay his bills.

a couple things:  one, you can download a large % of the chain as a torrent and load it in; which is still secure and much faster.  two, you can rely on neighboring nodes to give you data about your addresses (not yet implemented in the main wallet, but will be eventually) so your wallet is useable while it syncs with the network.
basically, in ten years, the optimizations will be in place that make this not a problem for most users; and, it is unlikely anyway that most users will be running full nodes (imo.. this is definitely not 100%)

The difference between PayPal and Coinbase in your example is this: PayPal does not actually clear payment to the merchant on behalf of the client immediately.  If the client tells PayPal the account was hacked or disputes the charge, PayPal can, and will, take the money back out of the merchants account, going so far as to send you to collections if you have already withdrawn USD below the reversed charge.
Coinbase is working on the "no charge back guarantee", since bitcoin is not reversible, Coinbase would be in weird situations when it had disputed charges, rather than being able to pass the buck like PayPal can.
Now, if Coinbase had an " instant purchase" feature already, I would agree, it makes sense for them to add that as a feature.. And if they haven't it's probably  the works out just low on their priority list of features.

If you are a highly engaged member of any community, you’ve likely run into trolls in the comments of your favorite websites.
 
These are people who come in with off-topic comments, cursing, highly inflammatory statements, or post things that divide communities or paint them in negative ways.
 
The Internet is the great democratization of information, and it certainly seems that trolls are destroying the experience for many online to those casually using the Internet. Are these Internet trolls multiplying? Are people now simply given a new avenue to say the things they want but do so anonymously, prompting more “troll-like behavior,” or is something else at play?
 
The Internet was a place to have productive conversations and open discussions regarding a myriad of topics, but that has changed for many as Internet trolling seems to be reaching new levels. Instead of open discussion and debate, it seems that many are only disrupting conversations on the Internet.
 
It seems that every few months, someone proclaims on reddit that paid internet trolls and shills exist in the bitcoin community.
 
These claims are usually met with responses from concerned community members, those saying it is garbage, and a series of questions from moderators telling the original poster to prove the claims being made. Many responses from the community insist that the Internet trolls aren’t disrupting anything and that self-policing and moderation will help ensure that trolling doesn’t have an impact.
 
While many would like to believe that Internet trolling doesn’t have an impact, the data simply says otherwise. In a study funded by the National Science Foundation titled “The ‘‘Nasty Effect:’’ Online Incivility and Risk Perceptions of Emerging Technologies,” researchers found that Internet trolling does in fact have a negative impact. This study was found that Internet trolling can sow seeds of doubt about the materials being presented.  This study offers several insights on how the online environment may shape and polarize perceptions about topics, including new technologies.
 
In the study, researchers set up a blog and asked participants to read a blog post they had created about a technology called nano silver. The blog post presented points detailing the benefits and potential risks of the technology and with a comments section. Half of the participants saw comments that were trolling and the other half saw a comments section displaying civil discussion taking place.
 
The comments displayed for both groups were of equal length, contained various perspectives, and both praised the technology and discussed the potential risks. Readers in the study group were asked how they felt about the technology before and after reading the comments.
 
The participants exposed to the civil discussion reported having the same beliefs about the technology after reading the comments. The participants exposed to the hostile comments reported far more polarized feelings afterwards than they had reported initially. After reading the “troll” comments, the participants reported feeling significantly more negative about the technology and its potential risks than they had previously reported prior to reading the comments.
 
The findings positively support the theory that Internet trolling can effectively change the perspective of others reading the material presented.
 
After the study was published, Popular Science removed comments from articles on the Popular Science website stating,
 
A politically motivated, decades-long war on expertise has eroded the popular consensus on a wide variety of scientifically validated topics. Everything, from evolution to the origins of climate change, is mistakenly up for grabs again. Scientific certainty is just another thing for two people to “debate” on television. And because comments sections tend to be a grotesque reflection of the media culture surrounding them, the cynical work of undermining bedrock scientific doctrine is now being done beneath our own stories, within a website devoted to championing science.
 
Even a fractious minority wields enough power to skew a reader’s perception of a story.
 
Several months ago, Coin Fire was tipped off about a group of “internet trolls” who were being paid to disrupt conversations across the Internet about a wide variety of topics, including bitcoin.  Executive Editor Mike Johnson and various members of the Coin Fire staff were highly skeptical of this initial contact.
 
Several members of the Coin Fire staff requested proof in the form of reddit account usernames, evidence the accounts were controlled by the individuals involved in the trolling and shilling, and researched the corporate entities that were supposedly the company name of this team.

There are lots of differences.  I am not sure if you are unfamiliar with the reality of libra or mongo, but I’m relatively familiar with both in that I’ve used mongo in production for several projects, and I just read the libra docs this morning.
And they aren’t the same for many reasons.
But since you are saying it doesn’t have any of the “required crypto features”. I am curious what you think those are?
You also both complain it’s pegged to the dollar and also not pegged to the dollar so I’m not sure where you are going with that, but they call themselves a stable coin and are making efforts to keep it a stable store of value by buying and selling fiat based assets to back it, so I really am not sure where you are coming from.  
It just seems like a generalized fuck fb, and there for fuck libra, and therefore it’s not a cryptocurrency.
Which I mostly agree with, fuck fb and fuck libra.  But it’s still a cryptocurrency and it’s still a stablecoin.

I have talked about remittances via bitcoin quite a bit.  A hard problem is finding critical mass.  
I have an anthro friend who does work in Haiti.  I think this is a better place to start for a few reasons..
Haitians are eager to embrace new technology and already send money within the country via SMS.
Small geographic area that a small number of exchangers could serve
High concentrations of Haitian Americans in the USA as well.

There are some good links, but bitcoin is, I think, vulnerable to the those with a lot of cash.
The market is nearly infinitely manipulable if you have billions to spend on it, including financial manipulation and computing takeover so that people lose faith in transactions.
It could have a sort of Streisand effect though so it may be more resilient than it seems on the surface, as it would be difficult/impossible to do totally under the radar.
I believe the window of opportunity for snuffing bitcoin into oblivion with legislation is past.  Any attempt would almost certainly only bring more eyes to the issue and would be too easy to circumvent.

Think of it this way:  in virtually every other economy, currency supply increases.  Often, it is increasing faster than the economy is growing (inflation).
With bitcoin, the currency supply increases, but it gets smaller and smaller until it isn't increasing at all.
So *if* it continues to get used, and *if* the economy with which it is used for continues to grow, then bitcoin will inevitably become higher and higher in value.
A simple way to think about it is this:  Right now there are 10 million bitcoins, the max there will ever be is ~21 million.
Whatever the total size of the bitcoin economy is worth (a very very fuzzy idea), divided by the number of bitcoins, is the expected value.
If you think bitcoin will never be used for anything other than speculation: then probably you would expect a stable price.
If the bitcoin economy was say, $1 billion dollars, that would have a fair value of a bitcoin be $100.
Total USA money supply (including all the fractional reserve banking) is something like 8 trillion dollars,  If this were magically demoniated in bitcoin: it would have bitcoin at something like $380,000.00/each
Of course this doesn't really make sense, but it gives you an idea of what bitcoin could be worth if it ever scales up and becomes widely used.  
I believe bitcoin has better than a .0026% chance of becoming as big as the US economy
Or even more, I think it has a better than 2.6% chance of becoming 1/1000th the size of the us economy
And thus, I think at $10/bitcoin they are a good buy!

To whatever degree nefarious actors are at play, it's unfortunate but probably inevitable.  The only logical solution is for miners to vote; if this creates a fork, the inevitable conclusion is that users will have their preferred fork.

It's a fair general reference, but a bitcoin node is not a critical system.  Any analysis of cost for running a node should fairly include the more fly by night type places, is all I'm saying.

Quoting here what I wrote on this before:
The reality is that there is incredibly good open source software; theymos should have considered (probably did) using it.
That being said; theymos did hodl through more bubbles than 90% posting in this thread experienced.
The money was donated for forums software; if theymos legit picked bad-ass '20 somethings' to write forum software from an idealic vantage point; the world will be a better place for it.
Theymos is in an awkward position; he himself is rich beyond anything the effort put forth actually would seemingly entitle him; additionally he is in custodian to an awkwardly-enormous sum donated with a specific notion in mind.
As a software company founder, as an early bitcoin adopter (here is me talking about bitcoin almost hitting $1 and as a philosopher; I see theymos as a person whom, long before almost anyone here tasted the bitcoin cream; is long divorced from conceptual reality wmoney and alliance.
Theymos could run away with all this cash and shaking a stick at him is the best you could do. It might be better spent directly feeding starving people, discourse is the the (imho) epitome of forum software for 2014-2015; and generally there are a million more-ideal choices theymos could have made.
That being said; theymos is obviously legit (or straight-up NSA.. in which case.. kudos you mother fuckers); I support influencing his decision to spend the money in good ways.
But, I have to .. as someone who has never spoken a direct word to him, give theymos his due. It's hard to imagine the enormously irregular happenstance theymos finds himself in; and he is doing at least decent.
On the most general note: the best developers are always in their twenties.. confidence of youth a decade of practice, a healthy distaste for the status quo. A top-tier dev can get 300k easy.. if theymos thought he was good; it's a fair market price.

Really?  I guess if they are mining from slowest internet ever ?  
I would expect to see to at least a couple high fee tx then, yet we see these blocks all the time with no tx.  
Certainly if it's pure profit, they are "wrong" because fees contribute more as a percentage of profit than they cost as an increased risk of getting orphaned?
Maybe my % of weak attack is too high and bonked config is too low, but the profit motive seems unlikely unless I misunderstand something.

The one thing that hasn't been addressed in here is that this actually happens all the time; because it turns our generating "random numbers" is really difficult.
That is not to say it is impossible, there are probably more good implementations than bad; but it is something to keep in mind.
People think they are generating random addresses but it turns out they are unknowingly limiting themselves to some extremely small subset; and when multiple people do this collisions happen.

The miner chooses which transactions to include.. Not including transactions resulted in a marginally smaller chance of mining an orphaned block.
If this was a pool it was probably a configuration error.  Otherwise it was just someone either weakly attacking the blockchain or a rational miner that thinks the decreased risk of being orphaned is worth more than the fees they would receive by including transactions.
I would venture 70% weak attack, 25% bonked config, 5% pure profit motive.
@_date: 2015-11-24 15:48:55
the ones i'm talking about are standalone so they just need to plug into ethernet or connect to wifi somehow to get on the network.  you can configure them from a laptop, or your phone or w/e.
this one for example: 
is like 100x as powerful as any of the usb ones (at least, that i am aware of) and falls below your budget.  
the ASICS that are 1-2 generations behind current ones can usually be bought up very cheaply, since they are actually not profitable to mine almost anywhere; they just consume more electricity than they generate in bitcoin.
if your electricity is free/cheap and/or you are just doing it as a hobby though, i think the s1 miners are probably the best bet

Installing the necessary software, the easiest part of all of this.. is itself non-trivial.  A reasonably technical/motivated person could definitely pull it off; but it could be be far more accessible as a 'plug it in, turn it on' fully contained thing.
Besides, good design decisions would likely make the device cheaper, smaller, and more attractive (and less likely to be insecure due to misconfiguration)  than the average person could reasonably put together from off the shelf parts.
I don't mean to suggest that this requires custom hardware by any stretch, just that I would personally (and I think others would as well) like to have a set-and-forget pretty-damn-secure thingy; especially one that relatively non-technical folk could also use.

@_date: 2015-03-26 18:40:16
You are right; to help the network you would have to accept incoming connections over clearnet; but transactions could still be broadcast over TOR.  I'm not sure, but this would likely require a slight patch to the satoshi client (to only broadcast local tx first over TOR, then again when it hears them from the clearnet network for the first time).
My thinking is that it would be simultaneously helping out the bitcoin network and the tor network; while providing a secure wallet.

Well my grandpa is probably closer to the age of your parents; and he does play the stock market considerably.

His choices in stock though is always 'safe' big names; and so he isn't as conservative as your grandmother, and he has awareness that holding bluechips has been a historically good bet; so feels generally safe doing so.  I have no idea how aggressive he is with % of income as cash, but I would guess incredibly conservative.  
They do keep weeks worth of non perishables as well.  
Bitcoin is far too volatile for him to just look at the graph and be like "oh yeah good idea" in the way you can look at the DJIA (especially up to the first popping); but I think there must be some subset of grandpa-types like I have that could be like, "well that seems like a good idea.. at least in theory".

It has been proven that some of these 'never moved' coins are by people who are not Satoshi.  Other people off the crypto email list were mining within a week of the original release.  You have to remember (or learn?) that bitcoin was worthless for at least the first year of its existence and many, many of these coins are lost forever.  People turned on the client.. mined a few thousand coins here and there and then turned it off.. never worryng about backing up their wallets.
Satoshi probably has a lot of coins, but to take every non-moved coin and attribute it to being owned by Satoshi is a breathtaking failure in logic.

it's not an electrum wallet in any case; it's a satoshi wallet.  
if someone wanted to buy the wallet and had good cred, i would just send them the wallet "for free" and divulge all my insider knowledge about the password; which would obviously have to be on faith.  but no one else has the wallet; there are a bunch of addresses in there that have coins moving in the same temporal period, etc so they could be reasonably confident i am not scamming.

This is only true if the exchange gives out your info.  Even so, you can provably get 'clean' coins by using blockchain.info's 'shared send' feature.
You can also tumble your coins around in many, many different ways to obscure/hide the link between the coins to you.
For example, if you buy coins from an exchange and send them to address_a then a cooperating exchange can link address_a to you.  However, if you send from address_a to address_b and address_c, then from there send to _d and _e; it is impossible to prove that you control address _b _c _d and _e; as it is indistinguishable from a blockchain analysis whether you spent those coins or sent them toyourself.

This is a nice idea but badly implemented.
Drug dog + shipper shipping drugs = jail.
This has to be a zero trust system.
Shippers should have to pay a deposit as well as the couriers.  Nash equilibrium needs to be assured using mutually assured destruction of a deposit; the courier cannot know the location of the package until the shipper has left it; and couriers cannot know each other's identities.
See 
If the courier doesn't deliver to the destination or the next courier then he loses his deposit which is worth more than the package so stealing the package will never be beneficial.
Couriers would obviously make money based off a percentage of the value.

This is clearly written from a "first world" perspective as you are ignoring the enormous potential upsides for the vast majority of the world: the poor.
Frictionless transactions between the world's poorest and the world's richest will cause an equalizing effect in wealth disparities (at a global level) never before realized.
You are all negative in these though experiments and you are ignoring
1. The link between the power to print money and ability to do evil.
2.  Current wealth disparities that will be lessened when the poorest in the world can compete on a level playing field with the richest.
3. Potential for "spontaneous order".
Overall I think there is a surprising dogma of statism apparent in your thoughts that I think will go out of vogue in the coming decades.  Governments and law enforcement are, after all, just people; and, if governments do indeed garner their authority from the just consent of the governed, then those currently consenting citizens can cooperate in the future under a differently-organizing scheme.
If for example, I am suddenly no longer under tax burdens, I have an extra ~40% spending money that I may well choose to fund some organizations that will feed hungry children, etc.

The fees serve two purposes:
1. Counteract SPAM transactions.  Since every bitcoin transaction is stored in every bitcoin node forever, a bloated blockchain severely hurts the network.  Forcing people to pay transaction fees limits their ability to just spam transactions that end up in the blockchain in perpetuity.
2. Miner incentive.  Transaction fees are only very recently becoming even a remotely meaningful part of the miner's reward for finding a block; but the minting reward (now 25btc, it used to  be 50btc) will reduce to zero over time and transaction fees will become a bigger and bigger percentage of the overall reward over the next hundred or so years; this is how Satoshi planned to keep the network secure while limiting the total number of minted bitcoin.

I am absolutely certain of   
I can show in few different ways: first yours.


People who believe the price will go up (for example, I am holding coins right now)


 Maybe, maybe not.  That is a hard problem to solve, and will depend on the country.  The only reason it is not perfectly frictionless to buy bitcoins "at market rate" is because of money laundering laws.  We have strong evidence (reality) that people are sometimes willing to go to extreme inconvenience in order to get ahold of them (this is likely because they believe they will go up in value very much, or, they very much want something they can buy with bitcoin but not with their fiat).


c.  Unsure.  Depends on their business model.  They may have some method of generating revenue by providing bitcoin liquidity that doesn't face the customers.


This is probably your best/worst reason to be skeptical of bitcoin.  I think it *could* be a "problem", ie, have unwanted effects.  However, I think what people sometimes are apt to do (and I have been guilty of this myself) is consider bitcoin in a vacuum rather than it's much more likely role as a single currency amongst many.  Perhaps short sellers can provide loans? 
Another way is this: Bitcoin *is* working, and bitcoin *is* volatile.  You can literally buy things for bitcoins right now.  Lots and lots of different things.  
Essentially the key to groking bitcoin is seeing it as
1. Empowering against what many, many people from basically every country feel like are repressive regimes.
2.  Not needing to necessarily have the key characteristics of your pet monetary policy in order to be useful/continue to exist.  People often forget/ignore that bitcoin was/is an experiment to bootstrap a currency from nothing within an existing global economy.  Perhaps x% inflation would be better than decreasing inflation / deflation. ; however, would *that* coin have gotten the critical mass necessary to become the phenomenon we have seen?  I think it is not perfectly likely it would. And, the creator(s) of bitcoin have to be acknowledged not just as great programmers, but brilliant in their meta.  It took a tremendous amount of work from a lot of people to get bitcoin where we are today.
Instagram was bought for $1 Billion cash; people thinking *bitcoin* has "far less" utility/value than instagram are sort of insane, in my estimation.  
Perhaps your PhD is making you blind to what is right in front of you; you don't want to end up on the wrong side of a paradigm shift as (young?) Doctor.

Summary is basically that the only reason we need an increase now/in the near future is Satoshi Dice; which is claiming 80-90% of tx's in blocks (when it is not down).  Some people consider Satoshi Dice to be an attack on the bitcoin network, and therefore it shoudl eb targeted directly rather than having a hard-fork to compensate for their spam.

Honestly, I think we are finding btc's 'true value'.  All of this btc going into the asic companies and silk road vendors needs to turn to cash, and as btc comes out of hiding faster than new people both adopt *and hold* bitcoin, the price will fall.  If the last crash was any indicator, we can expect the bottom to still be months out.
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:41:19
Right; they can't really 'make an attempt' without going for a full day or hundreds of blocks; as that is exactly what an attempt looks like; this is stastically guaranteed as this is exactly what proof-of-work is meant to handle.
They would *have* to stop paying customers for extended periods of time to make a reasonable attempt at finding 4 blocks in a row *AND* they would need to have a worth-while double-spend within that first-of-four blocks; which of course they wouldn't be able to know ahead of time which block it would be.
This would be reasonable for someone with 25% hashing power to themselves and a big bankroll since they could keep trying again and again withhout repercussions.. but a pool will have their customers start leaving at the first sign of abuse since there is just so little friction to change pools.

As I suggested above: use drop points that are discovered by the receivers only after the shippers have left them.
Then use mutually assured destruction to force nash-equilibrium to keep both sides honest.  
It is definitely non-trivial to find good drop spots; but in cases where you are willing to go to great lengths to avoid using traditional shipping services, this seems to me to be a relatively small "tax" compared to exposing yourself to potentially bad legal/violent situations.

Mathew O'Brien fails at critically thinking about money.
He claims 


*needs*?  No. *ideally* we would have a perfectly stable value.  How do?


Yes, bitcoin *is* a commodity.  An infinitely divisble, low trading-friction, incredibly scarce, commodity.  What have people used as currencies throughout history?  Commodities that have this definition!  In jail sometimes [they have to use cigarettes](
A currency is no longer a currency when people stop using it as one.  Head on over to [the silkroad****]( and tell me bitcoin is not a currency.  This is just inane chatter from a dilettante.

False.  
Bitcoin uses computing power to create it's value, but it is not itself a /standard/ of value.  
I think you are actually wrong about computing power in general, computing power was *much* more precious 50 years ago than today; because it was more scarce.  Computing power is only getting cheaper and more ubiquitous/abundant; which is not true about bitcoin.  
Computing power in the furture will be even cheaper and abundant, and therefore less 'precious'.  
Bitcoin uses *restrictions on the ability of computing power to solve problems* to guarantee consensus.

I think you severely undestimate the cost to do a &gt;50% attack.  Probably the only people in the world capable of pulling it off are avalon (or maybe BFL if they aren't full of shit).  
With infinite money it could be done now, but the resources would be mind boggling.. certainly more than "a couple million dollars".  By the time bitcoin is threatening the dollar, hashing power will be easily an order of magnitude or more beyond where we are.
Consider that the top ten super computers in the world all working together would not cover 10% of the total hashing power.  The top 500 super computers working together would not beable to do a 51% attack.
You would need specialized equipment which is in very few hands.

As much as I am a fan of open software (I write this inside chromium on linux running in xmonad) I strongly, strongly recommend *NOT* rooting your android if you are going to carry or have access to non-trivial amounts of bitcoin on it.
The google play framework essentially takes the place of antivirus software and you can be reasonably sure your system is secure.
If you unlock your phone/tablet and start downloading cracked, unsigned apps it is only a matter of time before you get a virus; as anyone who was downloading warez in the 90s should be viscerally aware.
AFAIK there is no satisfactory 3rd party virus protection or "safe" place to get cracked software for android; virtually everyone who has had their bitcoin stolen on their phone was running a rooted android.

I do my best to replace my bitcoin whenever I spend it; because I (like most people here) believe it is only going to be worth more.
You shouldn't feel bad about this though, this is essentially a variation of [gresham's law]( in effect.  We are forced to use pounds/dollars/euros/rubles (et al) so we will choose to spend those first rather than spend our bitcoin; because we perceive bitcoin as 'good' money.
One of two things will happen: 
* Bitcoin will collapse
* Bitcoin will continue to be mostly hoarded until merchants accept only bitcoin.
You can actually see this quite clearly with Silk Road.  Silk road is by far the most successful bitcoin-only retailer, because there is a huge demand, and you cannot purchase what they've got without bitcoins.. so people are super willing to part with their bitcoins.
When I can buy a USB drive with either USD or BTC, I might convert some USD into BTC to spend the BTC to either get a discount or just support a merchant; but I am not going to let me BTC go just yet.. I will spend my USD first.

bitcoin changes to worht $50
seller renegs and coins go back to buyer;  who eats the $50?  when does it change?
it seems like the problem here is that someone needs to take the risk if its going tobe in escrow
maybe there is some other fiat escrow service you can use
so it looks like

Yes and no.  The QT client has a console that allows you to type arbitrary commands; and one of those commands allows you to unlock the wallet for an arbitrary amount of time.   But OP would have had to go opened and advanced console and type something like

No.  
 is flawed.  Why would an early adopter, who has sat through the spike to 31, the never-guaranteed rise to even pennies or a quarter, suddenly decide he wants to sell 500k coins and not get as much as possible in usd?
If they've held onto that many coins for this long, he or she believes the long term technicals are solid and wouldn't have incentive to suddenly trade half their position for $25MM.    If they felt a need to hedge like that he would have done it a long, long time ago.
If they were trying to maximize but *didn't* believe in long term fundamentals, and somehow magically didn't sell a long time ago, they would be fine with huge peaks above 50 obviously and would just do his best not ot crash the market; but he would have no incentive to keep it arbitrarily low.
I would think it is far more likely a large player is holding the market as low as possible to *acquire*; possibly partnering with with someone who holds bitcoins (and wants to keep them); and using a large sell-wall to psychologically motivate people to sell their coin lower.

Nothing you can do if you don't trust the niece's parents, at least easily; but I plan on giving some bitcoin to my recently-made nephew on a paper wallet for my sister and her husband to guard.
I suspect there are actually probably legal ways to do this; granting access to a deposit box or something.. basically a Trust that she has access to at a certain age that would be outside the scope of her parents rights; but almost certainly not worth the cognitive effort and cost for what currently amounts to ~$1500
If you are slightly paranoid; you can do an M of N transaction with you and the parents as the holders, requiring 2 of 3 of you to unlock it; this would prevent a potential rogue parent from stealing the bitcoin.
But there isn't much you can do until little niecey has the cognitive capacity to deal with private keys; which I suspect will be super duper easy by the time she is in her teens

it proves nothing, sure.  it is however stastically incredibly likely. consider a thought experiement:
in the first case, people were in fact exploiting gox and and attempting to manipulate the price.. what would those "facts" look like?
in the second case, people were just lagging out mtgox "for fun" and no one ever tried to manipulate the price, what would those "facts" look like?
I think you wills ee that they look very, very similar.  So you going around saying "oh you have no evidence" is just bleh.  There *is* evidence.  There is *not* proof; but it is highly likely, inductively speaking that some of these claims are true.
People manipulate, much, much larger markets than bitcoin (do you need "proof" of this too?); why in god's name would this market be magically immune to people manipulating the price?  
Under your requirements it is literally impossibel to "prove" these claims, despite them being obviously true in many cases.

if bitcoin is 1c each you cannot safely do a meaningful transactions measured in dollars.
consider that a transaction happening in bitcoin is essentially limited to some small % of it's total market cap.  transfers between people just in bitcoin where there is not fiat-&gt; bitcoin or bitcoin-&gt;fiat on either end are obviously limited only upto the theortical total market cap, but for people to use btc as a means of exchange without needing to speculate on btc (which will be extremely common if and when bitcoin makes real inroads to s-curve adoption) then slippage will matter more.
it is, right now.. trivial to send say.. 1000usd using bitcoin as a mechanism across borders assuming bitcoin is fully liquid on both sides of the transaction.
i buy btc for 1k and send it immediately; you receive and sell for 1k pretty much immediately.  however, if we tried to do that today with say.. 1 billion usd, it wouldn't really work, since acquiring 1 billion usd worth of btc would cause so much slippage that you could not reliably sell on the other end for the same price.  of course this is a spectrum and not a hard line; but the amount of 'value' that can be transfered in one transaction, as well as the the amount of 'value' that can be transfered over a given period of time in a reliable way is directly correlated with bitcoin's market cap; and hence, it's price.

good!  hate to see someone get scammed because they are nice.
one more thing to look out for is a lot of periodic initiated transactions that don't get finalized.  you will obviously get a lot of these; especially today as people checkout your shopping cart
but if you see a pattern (like a script running on cron); steam codes are fairly liquid so people could use you as free insurance.
like, every 5 minutes i start a transaction, then if bitcoin crashes or drops 10% (happens all the time as we know); i actually send you the coin; and you end up sending me $100 worth of steam credit for $90
an hour is pretty generous amount of time; i think coinbase and bitpay give you something like 45 seconds before they recalculate the exchange rate.
of course, if you have to write code to do all this it might not be worth it; but do keep a lookout.

You wouldn't necessarily; this is a good point.  But the way people generally use mixers is they send them to the mixer and the output is someone else; rather than themselves.
If you have plenty of coins your method would actualy work quite well I believe; but the wallet you use would have to know to keep those two addresses seperate; as by default there is some optimization done.
Your method fails though if I only have 1.07 btc total and I need to send 1.07 btc to someone.

Since no one gave you the technically correct answer in it's shortest form (in the way I think you are asking it):
A single bitcoin is [unit of account]( in the bitcoin ledger.
When you mine for bitcoins you are looking for a hash of the block (a block is really just a bunch of text, and a hash is just an integer) below a certain number.  Basically, the higher the difficulty the lower the number needs to be.
The analogy I usually use for mining is imagine rolling a trillion-sided dice (or a D10^12 for you nerds) and whenver you get a number that is less than, say, 1000; you have successfully 'mined' the block.
When you find a block you get (currently) 25 bitcoins plus the fees in the block (which typically amount to ~.3 to .4 btc).  
Most mining is done in pools though, so a group of people are mining together; and regardless of who actually finds the block the reward is split up based on how many times each person rolled the dice.
So if our group collectively rolled the dice 500 times; and one guy rolled the dice 100 times, and the guy who actually solved the block rolled the dice 50 times.. the guy who rolled the dice 50 times would only get 5btc, while the guy who didn't solve the block, but rolled 100 times would get 10btc.  (there are actually a lot of variations on the way to calculate awards in pool mining but this is the basic idea)

you only lose money when you sell.   all the people who bought at the high of 260 in april and sold on the way down lost money; but simply holding for 6 months would have made them a mint.

i have the vast majority of my networth in bitcoin (because it grew that way) and I was just looking at ways to diversify at little bit when it crashed. 
honestly, i am not surprised this happened, and i expect it to happen again.  i am long on bitcoin still.  of course, i wish i would have sold everything i had at the top and bought back at the bottom, but i will hold bitcoin till it goes to zero, honestly.  i put in what was fair amount of money to me years ago (i earn more in fiat now than i did then), and taken out far more than i put in; so if it goes to infinity, like i absolutely expect, i will be set for life.  if it goes to zero, well.. i hope i was smart enough to hedge my bets on the crypto currency that wins.

but as a technology, it doesn't seem like bitcoin is going anywhere.  for the most part, the silk road doesn't care if bitcoin is $1/btc or $1000/btc.
my "net worth" dropped roughly  90k during this crash; but the truth is i was really surprised at the run up happening.  i expected prices in the hundreds.. but not until 2014+
bitcoin hit critical mass and the timing with cyprus made a perfect media-storm to cause the over-buying.  i held through the previous crash, and i held through this one and i will hold through the next.  (i sold a small % near the top as i was able to wipe out a lifetime of debt with it)
if bitcoin takes hold as an accepted medium of exchange across a non-niche audience then it's valuation is necessarily much, much higher than it is now.
the path from zero to any valuation is not going to be a straight line; so these swings do not surprise me.

it goes to a new address in the wallet you imported your paper wallet to.
it is hard to understand because of the word "paper wallet" which should really be called "paper address"
bitcoin wallets are files that have several addresses inside of them; they are collections of addresses.
a paper wallet is just one address.
so when you import a private key into a digital wallet, it will have that address as one of several other addresses.
when you send the coins from the imported address it will send the change to a new, empty address that will be in the wallet.
from there you can send the coins back to the paper wallet, or you can just make a new paper wallet with the new address

You are wrong.  When you agree to the terms of service on paypal you are following their rules.  
About 7 years ago I was scammed out of about $200, I had pulled the $200 out of my paypal and had nothing in there.  After the person reversed their $200 transaction, I owed paypal $200.. I had negative money in my account.   They sent me to collections and I eventually paid it.
You are in fantasy land with all of your predictions about what paypal will do.  "Impossible to perform the chargeback" lol.  No way dude.  You *may* be able to win in court, but I guarantee they *are* going to come after you for 10k.. they came after me for $200.

yeah; just skip the mod and get an ego battery battery.  
though, i did find this which is a pretty damn good deal: 
i can't speak for ecigfrenzy.. i never ordered from them.
this is a good choice i think since you can later upgrade to a rebuildable atomizer or get something with replaceable heating coils like the protanks.
i would definitely recommend either getting the vamo2 (a great mod for the buck) and the cheap cartos to start, or getting an evod battery and a good carto like a protank to start.  that way you have at least one thing that will stick around. 
if you go the mod route (recommended).. next thing you will want to pick up is more/better batteries.. i would get atleast two batteries so you can have on charging while using one.
the good thing about the vamo is that it will take 18650s as well which last much longer; and they can be sourced from anywhere, not just ecig places.

It is very simple: they can do it extremely easily with zero risk.
Signing up for bitpay will allow them to accept bitcoin while not having any exposure to the exchange rate if they choose, or they can choose to keep some of their profit margin in bitcoin.
It will give them exposure as they there are very few medical practices accepting bitcoin.
It is super, super easy.  Tell them to sign up at bitpay.  When someone wants to pay in bitcoin.. show them a qr-code on a smart phone, monitor or tablet.
The crux of it is they have nothing to lose.
They get free advertising.. and on top of it all they save the roughly 2.5% in fees they are probably being charged for most transactions.

I am not going to dig through links to prove my point; but if you look at links on this subreddit from around the time of the crash in April other people have done really good indepth work to show the manipulations.  People were using the buggy matching engine to freeze gox (putting in a bunch of really small orders close to each other and then putting in one large order to match them all at once would allow one person to freeze the exchange for minutes at a time).. what people did was match these 'micro matched' transaction's timing with large sell offs.
You can hark all you want about how there is 'no facts or evidence' but that is honestly just silly.  Perhaps you have not seen the evidence... but as someone who has been watching bitcoin for several years now, I feel quite confident when I am saying that people have *obviously* attempted, and somtimes successfully so, manipulated the price of bitcoin.
It was even more common years ago when it took much, much less capital to move the exchange rate more.  
I agree that most of the highly volatile moves are psychology based.. but to pretend like there isn't rampant attempts to manipulate an unregulated, low liquidity market is pure naivety.

That's appreciated FredEE, but what isn't talked about there, or anywhere else I have seen, is the practice of waiting until the very last moment to mark these transactions as high-risk.

Waiting until minutes before after people have been waiting a week is literally a recipe to piss people off.

It's difficult to say (maybe some IP analysis could be done); but I would bet bitcoins to dollars that the CIA controls significant bitcoin; probably that they have mined themselves, and/or bought with cash through localbitcoins or similar.
THere is just no way they aren't interested (silk road, if nothing else.. and there a LOT more to be worried about than silk road) enough to through some meager resources at it.  5k-100k might seem like a lot of money to us, but that's not even a dent in an expense budget for some entities that would have high interest in being able to play with the bitcoin network from the inside.

Super smart for them to pivot like this; and I think there is room for western union to provide the same service to consumers (who maybe only want to deal in cash) but sending money over btc instead of bank lines.

1. Litecoin will be mined by ASICs if itss price holds up; scrypt is memory intensive but litecoin's 1024,1,1 params don't flex this nearly enough to matter and ASICs are only a matter of economic, not technical, limitations to Litecoin.
2.  Fees are associated with space in the blockchain, not cost of mining.  Fees would be the same whether there were 1000 people mining or 1 million.  The whole argument against lowering fees (and increasing block size limit) is that it exasperates the already-existing problem of too-few people running full nodes; as bigger blocks makes the resources required to run a full node even higher.   This is 100% absolutely orthogonal to the hashing algorithm.
Consider that fees are typically ~1% of a miners total reward for any given block; there is zero correlation between so-called 'expensive fees' and hashing algorithm.
If and when litecoin approaches transaction volume as bitcoin, it will have the exact same issues: balancing a bloated blockchain vs cheap transactions.

STOP EVERYTHING YOU ARE DOING.
if you want to maximize your chance of recovering that wallet you need to disregard whatever the fuck that microsoft bullshit is and take the hard drive out of the laptop.
you then need to plug that laptop into a computer; preferably on a SATA cable directly; but you can get by with a a sata-&gt;usb if necessary.
you then need to do a FULL DISK IMAGE using LINUX dd command.
you then need to give that IMAGE to anyone you want to try to look for the wallet.
you then need to tell that person EVERYTHING YOU REMEMBER about that wallet.  were you using the bitcoin-qt wallet, electrum, multibit?  was it just an exported private key, or listof keys?
if your hard drive has a fair amount of space that you have not filled and the NTFS isn't fucked-all retarded you have a pretty decent chance of recovering the file.
but this begs the question.. why did you delete a file in april and wait until today to freak out about it?
the most ironic part is that if you took glassuser's advice and made a disk image of the live files on the disk that potentially has the file you exponentially increased your chances of being fucked.  DO NOT WRITE TO THAT GOD DAMN HARD DRIVE

I wasn't saying they would necessarily disrupt bitcoin.  More like get an inside scoop on what is going on.
I think the window is largely over for them to disrupt; in any significant way at least.  
I would think they would more generally just want info; and would not be surprised if one or more major bitcoin personalities are agents of sort (maybe I have just watched one too many movies).. it just seems like too obvious of a target for them not to gain intel there.  
If I were the CIA and I was going to try and attack bitcoin I would:
- Buy up as much as possible while keeping price as low as possible
- Delegitamize it in every possible way through propaganda and hacking every bitcoin company.
- Embed one or more agents into the ecosystem
- Try and run a scam to get as much control over bitcoin as possible.
Now, if totally destabilizing the economy didn't work, I would at least now have a huge hoard of bitcoin to either a) try and crash -- but they are too smart to try that at this point b) control a significant % of a current almost guaranteed to become the black market currency of choice.

Whichever transaction gets included into an (unorphaned) block will "win" and the other will remain unconfirmed and then ultimately rejected as it sees that the input (the wallet you put on both files) is now spent (wherever it was included in the blockchain) and therefore the "other transaction" (the one that lost) cannot be valid.
When checking the validity of a transaction the client will check to see if the input is unspent.  However, in your case, it will *NOT* be unspent and therefore will be rejected.

yes, security would be difficult.  it might be best to not sell items at all and only allow for status symbols paid for in btc and in-game currency "deposits" in btc, and everything else is discoverable not-directly-convertible to btc.  There would be nothing stopping the game from creating a bunch of super-elven-swords that the market chooses are .003 btc each; and indeed the company should use this as a revenue stream.

which is fine for short periods of time but this would mean a pool which should be finding ~25% of blocks would not be paying customers for days at a time.  
additionally after some reasonable amount of time of no blocks being relayed by the pool, individual miners would very likely get curious and if one of them saw they mined a block (which their miner will tell them) that wasn't relayed it would be a cut-and-dry case.
in order for things to go like you are saying they would/could, a series of very unlikely events would have to happen
- btc guild starts purposefully orphaning blocks
- miners don't notice/care that their pool is running in the 99.9% bad luck percentile
- no one on btc guild notices that their mined block is not relayed by the network
- all of this for hundreds of blocks in a row
it is possible, but extremely unlikely to me that the entire network would just shrug their shoulders at the pool suddenly going from 1/4~ blocks to 0 blocks for even a full day

Because they have to orphan blocks to attempt a double spend.  
When they are purposefully orphaning blocks and failing to hit their double spend (which will happen (1 - (.25^num_blocks ))*100 % of the time).  
That is, by attempting a double spend they will not pay any of their miners.. if it's 4 blocks needed for  a double spend (realistic) 99.96% of the time they will not be paying their miners anything at all.

sort of.. to use bitcoin as a currency in the game you would have to have all the transactions on the blockchain, which would be really annoying an unnecessarily spam the blockchain.   we could call it "bitcoin" in game or "magicbucks" but if it weren't *on the blockchain* at best it would just be backed by bitcoin.

I like this idea.  It seems really vulnerable to social engineering though.  These questions, in particular at least, all seem like things I could reasonably find out over time in a completely non-suspicious way, if not piece them together on facebook, etc.  So if anyone other than your family got a hold of this, I wouldn't feel completely safe.
I would recommend adding a variable length random set of chars that need to be learned explictly.  or even better some sort of really sloppy l33t4p3a4 that encodes some idea that is *not* written on the piece of paper  Then put that in a random place in the pass phrase (front, end, between two words).
For example, in this case.. you might  tell your family, "after you generate the passphrase, instead of the hyphen in my first job, put --hyphen--
This makes it that much harder for an attacker who gets access to the clues.
So you would end up with actually a 108char password in this case, but the only place this information *ever* existed was in your spoken words to your family.  (who it seems should collectively be able to remember it).

That's not really true.  Imagine if bitcoin was worth .00000001$
There is not enough BTC to allow for a very big economy.
I guess the minimum price for BTC as 100% currency and 0 commodity would be
    velocity_of_money / average_time_between_txs_per_coin / number_of_coins
So lets say
    velocity_of_money = $1M/day
    average_time_between_txs = 5 days
    number_of_coins = 11M
That would give bitcoin a base value of about $0.18
But at velcoity    = $1B/day
bitcoin has a base value of $181.18

Yeah we clearly are coming from different places and I recognize I am in the minority.
You are right that very very few people own bitcoin; but most people (in the so called "west") have *heard of* bitcoin.. which a year ago wasn't true.  I see it just like electricity or the combustion engine; it is such an obviously amazing idea that gives so much value that it will inevitably be adopted.
But, I will take your skepticism to heart; not to give myself doubt, but to better present ideas I want digested by those in the bitcoin community.

some cryptos have done similar; notably quark.  i actually like this aspect of quark, but the premine and reward structure breaks it; as it is 1) so unfair that it doesn't incenvtive even earlhyish adopters and 2) the reward structure is too broken to incentive people to mine.
however, i think an alt-coin that forked quark (and called it boson) and had a better minting/reward structure would be successful and become the de-facto cpu coin.
all that being said; i don't see a problem with asic farms; there are enough competing people that in the long term i don't see consolidation becoming an issue.
it makes sense to me to have a dominant sha256-asic coin, a dominant gpu coin and a dominant cpu coin;   
i suspect asics will be made for litecoin within 2014 which will leave room for another scrypt coin with variable N to scrypt to become the dominant gpu coin; which will probably allow some of the other scrypt coins with variable inputs to florish.

If you are sending large amounts of money, and the users are trusting enough to set up an online account to accept their bitcoins, and you are sending to the USA or one of the other Western countries that have ACH transfers (or their equivalent) available, then it can be cheaper (though almost certainly not easier at this point) to send money to these people.
So I think the strict answer to your question is /no/.  It is not going to be easier, period.  It can certainly be cheaper however.
The real issue, I think though, and maybe I am threadjacking a bit here, is sending money *from* the USA, or Japan, or any other 'First World' country back to a developing nation, or Mexico for that matter.
This is western unions bread and butter; remittances.  Being able to send a few bucks back to Haiti or Nicaragua from NYC without outrageous Western Union fees, and in an easy-to-understand way will be the *coupe de grace* that ends any doubt about Bitcoin's long term viability.

EVE is incredibly successful and allows arbitrary deposits with USD.  Imagine how much more successful it would be if you could directly withdraw ISK and spend it on anything.
I think the game would have to be fun for it's own sake, with the added bonus that anything you earn in-game youc an withdraw into the real world.  Any deposits for in-game status symbols or (maybe, maybe not) in-game items, would go half to the copmany and half to "the game" in the sense that it would be added as rewards for missions etc, so the natural effect is the richest people are subsidizing those who are grinding their in-game currency to play for free plus a profit.

I'm clearly using the word facist lightly here.  But I do think some subset of redditors like to exert authority where there is no real good reason.
The permissive atmosphere is *good*.  There is no problem with memes being in this sub; nonewhatsoever.  You have all this strong opinion about what should or shouldnt be in this subreddit, yet you admit yourself that you don't even pay attention to whats going on in bitcoin.
This strongly suggests to me that you are actually more concerned with "cleaning up a sub" because it's part of your identity to push these types of 'causes' or that you have some sort of preconceived notion about what a sub should look like rather than actually 'suffer' from any of the content here.
I had r/atheism on my subbed reddits for years but never really went to the actual subreddit; what percolated to my front page was fine most of the time, but I found it to be too circle-jerky about something I don't care about.  I'm an atheist, but find atheism boring and people that primarily identify as atheists boring.
But, I do care about bitcoin at the moment; and the circle jerk doesn't bother me as much because of it; even though I get downvoted for suggesting we maybe take a cautionary look at ourselves; I still want to have a place to put my finger on the pulse of bitcoin and I find this subreddit a great place for that.
So, as someone who *does* pay **way** too much attention to bitcoin; and someone who does read this subreddit pretty thoroughly, I respectfully ask that you, who does not pay attention to this sub or pay that much attention to bitcoin to back the fuck off with your preconceived notions.

you cannot salt and hash credentials you are going to use.  salting and hashing is when you need to verify credentials without actually knowing the password (you just know the salted hash of the pw, like verifying login information.
in this case, they are using mysql credentials to connect to their database; having salted+encrypted pw would make them not able to do this.
it is not standard to encrypt or salt mysql passwords; but keeping them in a seperate file *is*.  
i am not that familiar with zend, but this doesn't appear to prove to me that they are actually keeping the credentials in their db config file; but i wouldn't be surprised, either.

because there are a max of 21million bitcoins
if 1 billion people end up using bitcoin: that means everyone can have approximately 1/50th of a bitcoin each
if the average person has even ~$100 worth of bitcoin when 1 billion people are using it, that puts each bitcoin at ~$5000/usd.  if you spend your 1000 on bitcoin now, you will get ~30 bitcoins.  
of course, these are more or less best-case-scenario for 5+ years from now.  its also possible bitcoin crashes and becomes 0 dollars, your coins get stolen or your hd breaks before you have a backup, or any number of other ways things can go wrong.
its a risky investment, i guess.  but the upside is enormous.

Most merchants will not even know.
The main thing though is that these coins get 'distributed' and can be mixed among 'clean' coins over time so that there is no statistical likelihood that the spender of the coins is the thief.  
The problem is really for the thief here; with a large amount of coins it is very difficult to clean them.
It is certainly possible a database will turn up that people subscribe to to nip this in the bud, but it will have to have mass adoption and be updated *very* quickly in order to be even remotely effective.
I think that adoption of such a database is unlikely; and thus I think stolen coins will need to be laundered in order to be safely spent; some thieves will inevitably tip their hand being too greedy in their conversion; but overall merchants will not be affected whatsoever.

I don't believe that inflation == bad.  
I believe that bitcoin is a new class of thing, like cars were not "horseless buggies" but rather an entirely new invention which has certain properties that give it such inherent value that it will inevitably be used by more and more people; just like the internet, electricity and the combustion engine.
The flaw in (and classicly trained Economists in general) is that they say "bitcoin cannot be a currency because x y z" without groking that bitcoin can evolve *in parallel* with traditional currencies and can reach wide adoption without an economy *ever* being 100% "run on bitcoin".  
Having an unseizable, frictionless, extremely low transaction cost, fully fungible, transferable value store, even if it is wildly fluctuating in value, is too attractive to too many people for it *not* to stick.
The silliest thing of all of this is that bitcoin *does* "inflate" right now, and will continue to do so at level much higher than the "healthy" 2-3% for the next several decades.

By amazon offering btc liquidity i just mean they would sell bitcoin for a slight profit to people who need bitcoin..someone wanting to make bitcoin loans, someone wanting to buy bitcoin to spend on amazon or elsewhere, selling to places like coinbase who need bitcoin to sell to cusotmers, etc.
I doubt amazon would use bitpay at this juncture, but we are talking a ways down the line when bitpay is orders of magnitude bigger.. unless they fuck up or bitcoin goes away bitpay is on track to become the next mastercard/visa.  Amazon *does* use them, because they need to.  A purchase of bitpay isn't out of the question at all though.
I think you have some fuzzy thinking surrounding the idea that amazon could have it's finances tracked.. there are so many ways amazon can hide/clean their coins that it isn't really worth getting into; but the problem you say would face amazon would really effect anyone.. including the silk road, etc.. I challenge you to point me to DPR's 'consolidated' bitcoin wallet/address.. 
Plus, at the stage we are talking about.. with mass adoption.. amazon would conceivably be able to handle expenses directly in bitcoin, at least some of them, and would not necessarily need to transfer btc into fiat.
Hiding their finances from their competitors ought to be trivial for a company like amazon using a currency designed specifically to by pseudonymous.

But there are infinite numbers of ways to bootstrap a currency, and this one actually worked.  It doesn't really matter what happened early.. if a few early adopters become trillionaires, then good for them.  What really matters is that we end up with a non-state controlled currency; and any other ideas you or anyone else may have about how it "should" have been done are
1.  Usually lacking in specifics about how it could be done that way.
2.  An option for you to start your own cryptocoin to prove how right you are
3.  Moot because what the early adopters did actually worked.

That $1.5bn number is rising very quickly and would essentially require a microchip manufacture to happen without anyone getting wind; which is possible but only for a very, very small number of people; if they started *today* by the time they were finished it is very likely they would be outpaced (since there are several for profit enterprises doing their damndest to crank out hashing power as fast as possible)
It's important to note that a 51% attack is really only good for double spending coins; you can't steal coins or cause detriment to the network in any meaningful way; since a successful 51% attack is a statistical, not guaranteed chance of happening; the attacker would need to initiate very large transactions, get some irrevocable value out of those transactions, and be able to either a) have significantly more than 51% of hash power or b) be able to make those transactions multiple times to time their double spend.
There wouldn't really be a way for the network to see it happening assuming it was a new player.  If a couple mining pools joined up and went rogue, that would be detectable and the miners would likely just move their hash power; but a well funded attacker would be indistinguishable from a legit node until the double spend was successful; at which point they could just get a new IP and start over.
There is some talk of giving a weight to nodes with long standing relationships (for a different problem) and if that happens, which it likely will, then 'emergency mode' could be turned on and a cabal of trusted miners could essentially block out an attacker; this could still be gamed, but it would be harder.


There are multiple known, published DDOS vulnerabilities which the 'trusted nodes' I mentioned above are more meant to counter.  It is pretty trivially easy to ignore traffic; the hard part is knowing which traffic to ignore.. but bitcoin doesn't really suffer from this in anyway that is different than basically anything else on the internet.


Take a look at 
Coinbase claims 600k users and only allows US citizens; I briefly looked but couldn't find a graph.  They have grown an enormous amount though
There are other wallets; people can and do have multiple wallets; many people just keep their coins on exchanges though as well which these numbers don't reflect at all.  
By pretty much every measure though bitcoin is adoption is exponential.


  claims 14k as of november just themselves; you can somewhat glean the growth rate from their posts.. and again, it's exponential


right.  but that really isn't an issue for a long time anyway.. ten years from now the miners reward will still be 6.25 btc; and consider what happened to miners *revenue* (measured in dollars) when the block halving happened: 
@_date: 2013-02-11 17:33:28
OP I think your question is not being answered in the way you meant.
The amount of bitcoins are controlled by software.  I am going to assume you aren't very familiar with the software world (as you would probably not be asking this question if you were).
Basically, when separate machines need to talk to each other, they use a protocol; which is basically a set of rules for how information is relayed back and forth.  A protocol you are probably familiar with is HTTP, the hyper-text transfer protocol.  It basically amounts to "these particular things mean this particular thing in this particular case"; and all internet browsers, and servers agree to use this protocol, and that is how things work.  
Imagine if we didn't agree on a protocol, how would anyone know what anything meant?  
Bitcoin, also, has a protocol.  It is *this* that controls the supply of bitcoins.  There is an agreement amongst all the software that is mining and passing transactions around that certain things will happen when a block is solved, including allowing the solving miner to send 25BTC to an address of their choosing (which will decrease to 12.5 in just under 4 years).  
So if a miner solved a block, but sent themselves 50BTC, or 999999BTC instead of the 'agreed upon' 25BTC, then the other miners would simply reject the block as invalid, it would not be written into "their" version of the blockchain.  That would be the equivalent of trying to 'change the supply'; all the 'honest' nodes on the network would basically say "nope" and those unfairly-generated coins would not be spendable on any of the honest nodes.
This is why people are saying economic majority; because it is *people* in the end who are deciding what software to run; and it doesn't make sense for them to run software that would be rejected by the rest of the network.
There are other competing blockchains that don't have a cap (and other variations).  But, if a miner started signing blocks with unagreed upon amounts of bitcoins in them, it wouldn't be *bitcoin* proper at all; because *bitcoin* is really just a protocol for communication.

| become a billionaire
A billionaire is on the optimistic side.  I think it will be easier to explain how one would become a billionaire by first explaining how they will solve a lot of social inequality.
A lot of social inequality is based off friction of economic transactions and, barrier to entry.
Consider in the USA you could easily go beg for 10-50 dollars a day in most cities; while in other parts of the world that 10-50 dollars *per month* in greenbacks would make the difference between destitute poverty and pretty nice life in (off the top of my head) 20-40% of the worlds population.
Now consider poor chinese grinding world of warcraft gold to sell to rich people.  Now imagine if that gold they were grinding, instead of needing to through a *high friction* exchange process to conver their WoW gold into local currency, could just withdraw it as such and spend it.
now, i am making two assumptions here to become a billionaire rather than millionaire
1. You are able to create a new worldwide phenomenon with a revolutionary game.. most successful MMO ever by a significant margin.
2. People are willing to put more money into this game than other games in history because its both the most popular, and, backed by bitcoin.
But if thats the case, and you get say, 50 million users, $1/month to play.
Players can also pay arbitrary amounts of money for ingame currency (perhaps a hefty "tax" to bring the currency into the game is levied, maybe as high as 20%.. with 10% going to the company and 10% going to quest/treasure/mines for all to potentially reap)
As well you would probably want to let people pay for aesthetic things, or other status symbols; with everything going 50/50 to the company and to 'discoverable' loot.
Now some math
50 million $1 minimum/month
Say.. conversvatively, you are getting average $5 a month gettng paid to you per player
$125MM/yr revenue PLUS $125 million a year in DISCOVERABLE IN-GAME LOOT +plus crazy high-valuations of companies (i mean, $1 billion for instagram)
means, create this game, be very successful, go public, easy billionaire

A 51% attack is actually a misnomer.  51% attack really just means "controls more than half the network hash power"
the worst an attacker could really do is 'double spend' coins.  so lets, say i do an exchange in person, cash for bitcoins.  i give a guy an address and $1000 and ask for 10btc.  he sends them to my address, i look on blockchain.info, it shows unconfirmed.. then beep.. one confirmation.
now that 10btc he sent me is "written into the blockchain", so I give him the $1000.   he walks away, and being an evil-doer initiates a double spend against me.. sending *those same* 10btc that he sent to me to another address he controls.
but wait!  how is that possible?  he already sent them to me, they are in the blockchain.. wont all the miners reject his tx?  yes, they will.. *BUT* since he is an evil-doer with &gt; 50% of hash power, he tries his best to mine *two* blocks before the rest of the network mines the next one.. and in one of those two blocks, he sends coins to himself, instead of me.
*IF* he is able to "get ahead" of the "real" blockchain, but solving 2 blocks before the network solves the next one then the evil-doers blockchain will become the longest!  in the game of bitcoin, longest chain wins.  the transaction to you goes into a block that has been orphaned; and you won't be able to control those coins.
the closest thing that could happen to make a 'protocol change' would be to vote (as a miner) to do something against the protocol, like what happened with the mini-hard fork recently when v.8 launched.  miners manually decided to mine from a different head; which could happen again if some nefarious entity pulled off a big double spend in an obvious way but only get ahead a few blocks.

I think you, like many people, are mixing up the means up the means with the ends.
I would *love* to see a thumbs-up from the USA government in exchange for regulation on bitcoin; but I am as radicalized, lets-have-a-revolution-yesterday as they come.
In the same way I am, in the end, a socialist (a bunch of cooperating people is obviously better than a bunch of competing people); but before that could ever happen we first need to be free.. so I lean strongly libertarian.
Regulation and Governments are both good and bad; the better the people int he world are, the less government is good; the problem isn't government *per se* it's super powerful people doing fucked up shit and government giving the means to do it.
If I had to pick between a sudden mass shift in class consciousness leading to an anarcho capitalist revolution and a regulated bitcoin economy.. I would pick the former.
But if I had to choose between the status quo and bitcoin being regulated.. i would choose bitcoin regulation.  In many cases I wouldn't, but, bitcoin allows us to skirt any regulation *anyway* with coin cleaning, etc.

I want a wallet I feel decently secure about.
I have been thinking about how to do this; and I think you really need a some sort of novel way to generate/enter the key to decrypt the wallet; perhaps a couple iterations of pattern-swiping.
Entering passwords into a touch screen is annoying as fuck; but I don't want an unencrypted wallet sitting on my device either.  
Perhaps a couple levels of security; a non-encrypted wallet, a lightly encrypted (3 iterations of the 3x3 grid pattern swipe), and full encryption (normal passphrase entering); with some decent UI for moving coins between them (ideally by moving private keys around so it's instant).  
this way i can have .1-.5 bitcoins in my easy-access wallet and i would feel comfortable with a few btc in my 'lightly encrypted' (cus it would cost more than a few hundred bucks to crack it in a reasonable amount of time); and then an arbitrary amount in my normally-encrypted wallet.
I currently don't use an android wallet because I don't trust them and don't know my android device well enough to know what is secure and what isn't.. so I keep like half a btc or so on coinbase and use their app.

Oh perhaps I am mistaken in thinking that anyone who could fund their account (or rather, legally hold an account with you) would be able to trivially convert to cash.  
Re taxes; I am aware we all pay them and die!  :-).  I really meant if there was some mechanism where I didn't have to take the gain upon conversion (ie.. if I bought 1 bitcoin at $1 and then deposit 1 bitcoin to you and get $700 in credit with you; my understanding is that I immediately have a 699 taxable event.  If instead I could send you one bitcoin, buy $700 worth of portfolio, liquidate that portfolio for $10k when you manage it perfectly for me, then have a single $9,999 event; that would be pretty cool.

The worst that would happen is that you would be lied to about how many coins you have.  An attacker could conceivably tell you they are gong to send BTC, so you then send them USD (or whatever) and then lie through the servers to tell you you received the coins when the rest of the network never saw the transaction.
In reality, with several 'non-cooperating' external servers, the likliehood of this attack is extremely small and you are ~99.999% as safe with a lite client.
edit:  also, unless you are leaving  the bitcoin-qt running all the time and allowing incoming connections; it is unlikely you are really helping the network much / at all by running bitcoin-qt.

Not really.  In theory you could obscure some things, look for known keyloggers, encrypt keystrokes, etc.. but in the end it's just a cat and mouse game if you are compromised.

Bitpay will accept bitcoin and convert them to fiat instantly (that is, convert them to USD if you are in the states).. if they say "this root canal costs $1342.37" and then show a qr code that says "please pay 1.32193 bitcoin" when the customer pays the bitcoin they will get exactly $1342.37 in their account.  
That is the main way bitpay is adding value, this on-the-fly exchange rate.  In addition, if your mother chose to, she could put in her account settings something like "convert 95% to usd dollars and leave the rest in bitcon"
If she chose that option, they would keep a tiny bit of bitcoin and the 95% woudl still get converted to dollars on the fly.
My recommendation to your parents would be, if they are super skeptical of bitcoin is to calculate the % cost they are paying in credit card processing fees and convert that amount to bitcoin with each transaction.  That way they would get the same amount of dollars as a credit card transaction, but get a little bitcoin bonus they can hold onto which will eventually be your retirement =P

There are three things that protect the buyer:
1. Ratings
2. Escrow
3. Tor/PGP
When you buy somethng, you don't send the money to the vendor, you send it to the silkroad, and they hold your money in escrow.  When you receive your package you release the funds.
As well, just like ebay, there is a rating system and it makes sense to trust vendors with hundreds of positive transaction ratings.
Using Tor to access the silkroad and PGP to send all your data back and forth really limits your 'attack vector' to the vendor being a honeypot and/or your package getting picked up in the mail.
In both of these cases, with *proper* care, it is unlikely anyone could have a case against you, as it would be trivial for me or anyone to buy/send any drug to anyone; so there would have to be some other evidence to link to your identity (correlation attacks on your Tor usage, previous linkings to your identity with the PGP key you used).
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:53:50
I strongly disagree with this.
There is no other 'catch all' bitcoin sub.  This sub has obviously grown huge over the years, but some people like the memes; the funny/good panic posts, the general LQ content.
There are other subreddits if you want something with a bit less cruft, was made for that.
There is no advantage to messing with this sub; let people upvote what they want--instead of causing a potential rift.
@_date: 2013-06-11 18:24:20
I think it's still early.  It's not as early as it was, but I think we have several orders of magnitude left to grow.
The key thing here to internalize is the scarcity of bitcoin; at only 11MM units.  With 11MM units and an interntet population of 2.5 billion (very rough estimate); there are roughly .0044 bitcoins available for each user.  
If bitcoin isn't used as a store of wealth, and is used more like paypal (some people will have to hold onto them for some amoutn of time); and there is an *average* of $5USD capital being held in BTC per internet user; this puts a single bitcoin at ~$1100USD
These are random numbers not meant to predict anything, but really just to give you a sense of *scale*.  Bitcoin market penetration is essentially NIL at this point; something like number of people using email in 1989.  
Since the market penetration still has *so much room* to grow; while the bitcoin supply has *so little room* to grow; the thing that must **give** is market value to bitcoin.
It is, of course, possible that bitcoin will die.  If you believe that bitcoin will rise before dying, then you are likely too late to the party; or at least might be.  I still think even if bitcoin dies we will see market cap in the tens of billions before that happens; but maybe you disagree.
But, if you think bitcoin has staying power, then no.. the party is indeed on Friday, and it's only Tuesday at lunch time.

But yeah, I can't imagine selling out of panic.  I will ride it to zero and be sort of sad, or (more likely) retire comfortably in my mid-30s.

Think about it this way: if the corralito happens, there will be more of a demand for bitcoin in your area since people will want to protect their assets, so you will probably not have a hard time finding buyers to trade your bitcoin for cash.   Check localbitcoins.com for buyers/sellers in your area.

It is nothing like paper money.  You can't use paper money on the internet.  You can't send paper money to someone in another country in an instant.
You *can* send digital representations of said money; but then it does NOT have low transaction costs (hence, credit cards).  
Bitcoin cannot be seized in the sense that your bank account can be seized.  You can have your money seized for simply being *accused* of a crime.  Cypriots had their money seized from their bank accounts.
Bitcoin can be *stolen* in the sense that you can lose your private key; in this sense it is the same as cash.  If your key is unencrypted and the cops come.. they can "sieze" it.  But not in the "we declare your money seized"--the way your bank account can be seized.. bitcoin is absolutely immune to such legal seizure.

Why cant amazon use bitpay and/or generate new receiving addresses for each transaction?
Much more likely than those 'easy' solutions would have amazon actually providing btc liquidity directly and using a service like bitpay to handle over flow in a way that is transparent to customers.
The issue with transactions being public is trivially a non issue with normal recommended practice whether you are some random guy making 3 sales a month or amazon.
As far as price stability goes, even if volume were extremely high, I am confident that bitpay and its inevitable competition will be able to handle demand.. Since every bitcoin spent on amazon has to come from somewhere, and that somewhere would be partially bitpay like services.
Using bitpay would instantly save 60%+ on transaction fees for amazon, and if they were providing some of their own liquidity they could potentially even eek out a tiny bit of profit for the btc they reveive-

Right, it would have to be a good MMO.  However I think a good MMO that has an ingame currency backed by bitcoin (and properly run) would blow away anything else in history because it would attract gamers, and, people who want to make money.
I don't think funding the game would be that big of an issue.  A game like this would easily cost 10s of millions in development capital.  You could put 5% of that into in-game discoverable and have plenty to start.
I would have all revenue go 50% to the company 50% to in-game discoverable/earnable.
I am not ignoring one of the great perks.  You *still* get to create digital goods out of thin-air; either selling magic wands directly, or just in-game status symbols (avatars, etc).  A possible idea would be to put different classes of items on different blockchains to guarantee their scarcity.

I agree.  
One thing that could trigger this is if two entities were trying to accumulate bitcoin positions at the same time.  
Only 3 million downloads of the satoshi client; I know I have personally downloaded it no less than a dozen times.. but lets say there are actually 1M users of the satoshi client right now (which seems overly optimistic to me); and another 1M that use alternative clients/online wallets.
If we cut down to just the USA (which is easier for me to reason about, since I'm from there), sourcerorge says that 20% of bitcoin-qt downloads are from the USA; so lets just pretend for sake of argument that the usa also has ~20% of the alternative wallets.
That puts us at an optimistic 400k bitcoin users in the USA including the barely-dabbling.
That is roughly 1% market penetration in a country where more than half of highschool students have internet in their pockets on mobile devices.  
There is easily room for another 10x market penetration, especially among kids and *especially* among those outside the USA who have the worst access to international markets/economies.
More and more people chasing fewer and fewer bitcoins has things like
- 1000s of people chasing millions of bitcoins
- tens of thousands of people chasing tens of thousands of bitcoins
- millions of people chasing thousands of bitcoin
The next order of magnitude growth, if it happens, will swing us to the point where there are more participants than bitcoins; which will blow the top off their value.  
it seems likely to me that big players will see this as a likely event and try and acquire position to benefit from it before that growth actually takes place.  If two competing entities have similar ideas around the same time; that's when i think we will see the 'spike'.

I applaud you doing it; and you will likely get some extra customers you wouldn't otherwise have.  
What would make this really exciting though is if people could convert to BTC from within their banyan account; and hold BTC as an asset.  If you do that, you go from boring to headline news.

They are on average 10 minutes apart by design; when hash power is being added to the network the net effect is &lt;10 minute average block confirmation time.
For them to get 7 in a row they would almost certainly need to "run good" meaning do significantly better than average.  If you look here:
You can see last block times / time between blocks.  Typically it is pretty close to 10 minutes on average.

the fees aren't too bad. once you are in gox; the trading fees are .55% per transaction so you are looking at something like ~$0.60 on top of the 5 bucks or so you pay to bitinstant.
would it be wise to put money into bitcoin?  hell if i know.  if bitcoin goes up another couple orders of magnitude then i am "set"; if it goes down, then i missed a chance to cash out a life changing out of money.

That being said it *does* make your support channel look terrible.  I know it is very likely not upto *you* personally; so I direct it at coinbase proper, the management, etc.. your customer support IS broken; and you are not leaving any room for anything other than people to air their grievances in open forums when the only way to get a timely response is open forums.
So, I don't mean, at all.. to come off like 'corgidad your a dick'-- I don't.. it's genuinely appreciated; and I think coinbase is a good company, offering a great service and has done a fuck-ton of good for bitcoin.
But, this *is* an open forum, and your (that is, coinbase's) support system as been continually fucked since day one.. of course people are going to bitch; and of course they are going to do it in an open forum *since you guys dont respond anywhere else*.

the main flaw with all of this is that bitcoin will never become "the one and only currency".  
At best it will get wide acceptance and be somewhat akin to what the USD is now; a sort of world reserve.  Local government will not stop issuing their own currency, almost certainly; as well, other crypto currencies are likely to gain traction.

Hmm sad sauce that it was a web client.  Since most of them except blockchain have gone defunct.  If you have another computer you should be able to just take the hard drive out of the laptop and plug it into a SATA port on your desktop; if the drive isn't corrupted you should be able to view it's contents without restarting.
You don't necessarily want to boot into the old laptop; you just want to access its data.  I would be scared of booting since you want to keep the data integrity intact and booting is a read/write process.
First thing I would do is copy your internet history folders.
Good luck
it's also possible you might be able to glean your external IP from that time as it is often embedded into websites (especially forums).  if you have your IP range from some dates and figure out what online wallet it was, you might be able to work with the admins some; in the end you will need to know your password, but you may be bale to get some hints.

It's not really true what you say.  Windows is not inherently insecure anymore than linux/mac is inherently insecure (all systems are inherently insecure).
There is more malware targeted at windows users, but that's it.  I don't run a virus scanner on my windows box (or my linux box); but I also don't download random shit and run it.  I stick to opensource tools when I need something random.
However, all that being said, I don't run any BTC stuff on the windows box, and have minimal on the linux box, my main btc interactions happen on a bootable live usb.

Probably very little chance it would help, unfortunately.  You could ask them (mtgox) to give you the IP and any other information available to perhaps track it down; maybe it was a rogue friend or something and you could backtrack if it was a local-to-you IP that initiated the transfer.

My answer in r/Economics:




There is so much truth to this statement. Economists do know. They have been taught by people with Phds, people who have better than anyone: explained, understood, and predicted markets.
Just as the learned knew the heliocentric model of the universe was the right and copernicus was a heathen. Just as the learned knew that phlogiston was released from combustion. &lt;pick your own example&gt;
You have your answer OP. That is why. Either Bitcoin is a paradigm shift, or it isn't.
If it is, history has taught us that most people will die holding their convictions to the obsolete paradigm rather than change their minds.
If it's not, then they are doing their job: warning us from our inevitable destruction.
r/Economics obviously upboats anti-bitcoin content: inflation == good is as deeply ingrained into an economics education as Jesus is ingrained into a Christian's upbringing.
Everything stems from that. As the cognitive dissonance increases the arguments will become more silly. People will claim it can't be used because the price fluctuates, while people use it everyday. They will claim it can't store value, while gaining 10,000,000%s over years (just like tulips!); where even the largest "crashes" anyone dares predict still leave it at a 10000%s of sustained value increase over years. They will claim "the government will surely shut it down if it gets big" while reading news for a decade how elevinty billion dollars and international task force can't bring down the fucking pirate bay.
The irony of the op linking to confirmation bias is, I hope, enjoyed by all.

Thanks for taking the time to respond.
I want to start out by saying I absolute wholeheartedly agree that the vast majority of the altcoins are bad for the movement, and will go a tiny bit further even and say I think they are themselves simply crap.
But, I do think that the rate of new cryptocoins being released is actually an extremely good *sign* of things to come.
I think where we differ is that you are maybe still skeptical that the world may not adopt cryptocurrencies; like it's still possible they get squashed, and the altcoin movement which is like 98% pure crap; almost everyone other than the miners are going to get burned hard.
I think that we are actually past that point; bitcoin is here to stay for a long, long time; and cryptocurrencies in general are here to stay basically forever.  You can't squash a good idea whose time has come; and that time is now, and that idea is bitcoin.
So I don't have any fear in that regard; my fear is only in picking the *wrong* cryptocurrency (but i am all in bitcoin so that shows you where my deepest intuitions lie).
That being said, altcoins are not going away.  I predict they will actually come into existence at a higher and higher rate; and by the time "the world" has embraced bitcoin (ie, by the time we are near the top of the S-curve) there will be several stable alt-chains; and bitcoin will probably be the "strongest".  It's one thing to downvote them to death (or even downvote silently the mere mention of talking about them constructively) in that vein; but it's another to disregard them entirely.
But overall, I think we actually almost entirely agree.  I don't want people to get burned; and that is why I wrote what I wrote.  
My fear (or, prediction.. depending on the context) is that a big bitcoin circle-jerk will call equally quark/megacoin/novacoin all scam coins as well as some new true, fair innovator that has yet to emerge.
Instead of saying "quarkcoin has a huge premine with 98% of all coin distributed right away.. SCAM!"--I would rather constructive criticism: the benefits/pitfalls of using a multi-algo proof of work scheme, the benefits/pitfalls of a "as the pitcher pours" (as the coin inventor puts it) initial distribution.
Even worse, I am seeing *proposed* coins get called scams before they are even released.  
This has two issues: it makes the bitcoin community just look bad, but worse, it keeps eyes off of what could be the cutting edge of "a whole new world".
So, I won't say necessarily that "altcoins are hurting the movement as a whole", though I do acknowledge I may be over optimistic at this point and you (and the community's) extreme caution might be justified.
However, I do think that downvoting / shaming / scam-calling alt coins *as a class* is going to do absolutely nothing.  Altcoins are going to continue to rise and fall, no matter what people on r/bitcoin say.
Since we cannot make altcoins go away to protect the world, can we not at least pick them apart piece by piece and say, "This is why this is bad" or "hmm.. that's an interesting idea but here is why it will actually fail", or "weirdddd would this really work???"

Well their contract is very explicit that it is a minimum of $50 million; so I imagine they will get that at least.
It doesn't matter that coinlab doesn't have anything but vaporware; they have a contract.  Besides, all of their software was supposed to be licensed from gox in the first place; the main value coinlab was providing was ease of friction in the us market.
edit:  regarding cash on hand:  
I think that if they lose the lawsuit (or more likely, settle out of court) they will get an investor or loan to cover damages.  They are on track for crazy-high revenues/valuation so it shouldn't be too hard for them to find some cash.

I have to disagree; I think we are still in for meteoric price gains, if BTC continues to prosper.  *IF* bitcoin becomes an 'accepted' place to store wealth; the supply and demand effects of such a scarce resource will inevitably cause another (probably couple) of boom/bust scenarios that we have already seen three times, that will end up with bitcoin levelingish out at an order of magnitude higher than it was before the cycle.
A stable value or gradual rise in price will happen only if adoption is slow; but, if something happens that allows bitcoin to gain another order of magnitude adoption (which, is inevitable if bitcoin continues to grow) then as people rush to get capital into bitcoin, we will see panic buying followed by panic selling.
Why is an order of magnitude growth inevitable?  Well, bitcoin has not penetrated mainstream.. adoption by any major company.. amazon, facebook, google, walmart, welsfargo, etc etc etc, bitcoin adoption would increase instantly over all bitcoin adoption upto that point.
And adoption by a major company is itself inevitable *if bitcoin has staying power*.  Bitcoin's advantages are either real or they are an illusion; if they are real, self interest will guarantee that one of these companies, probably many of them at very close intervals, will adopt (then they fight you, then you win) bitcoin.  it just doesn't make logical sense that every major company in the world will keep it's distance from bitcoin if it has real economic advantages; companies chase profit, and profit is helped by economic advantage.
The only way I can conceive of this line of reasoning being off is if bitcoin has staying power as a purely blackmarket currency; in which case slow, gradual growth is very likely.. even so, though, there are major cartels who could easily push btc up an order of magnitude by adopting it (but I think they would actually be more inclined to use an altcoin at this point).

There is no way to consider gwern normal; I mean.. maybe he looks normal and speaks normal, but.. I mean.. look at his website.  He is no more normal than any reclusivish genius.  
His writing would not be nearly as interesting if he were 'normal'.  I would agree that it is 'weird'; but in a way that makes me smile.

is there a link to this hosted by them?  there are typos in here that make me think this is a hoax
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:35:35
Yeah I think it doesn't actually matter 'which' so much; digitalocean has super competitive pricing so I would definitely consider them; but beyond that I was just pointing out that spreading them across datacenters and geography will contribute more to the network than 3 nodes sitting on the same rack.

You are fine to to browse silkroad 2.0; checkout just don't buy anything illegal.
you can even use onion.to router TO BROWSE onion sites to make it easier.. but for the love of god if anyone sees this and decides they want to do something illegal do NOT use onion.to

"Not quite"  what?  there is 0 chance this guy built the underlying 'gambling' bits in minecraft.  
you have no idea what you are talking about and your arbitrary limits are silly.  he is smartly starting this thing in play money mode only, but your fears are baseless.
you likely have no idea how satoshi dice is built; and there is 0 reason this thing couldn't be built with the exact same 'from the ground up' security implications.  it is simply using minecraft as a display layer.

they have hundreds of thousands of subscribers paying $15/month plus buying plex.
idk how you can say they aren't successful

awesome; sent another .05 btc
i really think what you are doing is both amazing from a social perspective just for doing good in the world, as well as for btc's cred.
it would be nice if, after this.. you could come up with some kind of estimate of how much you've received in donations and make a press release.  obviously we can't look at total btc since the exchange rate has been changing..
also, idk ifyou are just converting to fiat daily or whatever or if you have some btc that has gone out of the main donation account but wasn't converted to fiat immediately; just giving the press some notion of overall value you have received and given would be really cool to know.
also, really really rooting for theymos coming through on that 1kbtc 
you're doing amazing work and history will remember you

Thanks, that is the information I was looking for.  I wasn't sure if there was something else I was missing.
I am surprised/confused Avalon only has 3 in the wild.  My assumption was that the next thousand would be easier to ship than the first 3.

I am not saying there can't be a better way; but your proposal is certainly *not* better.  THis is my point.  Lots of people complain about the unfairness without any real consideration of the facts.  
I have yet to hear/see a better recommendation, and I have heard lots of different attempts.  
Giving coins away to people on reddit is laughable compared to letting people mine their own coins.  Everyone who isn't on reddit would complain.  
I bought my first bitcoins for like a quarter each, I easily could have bought thousands; but I didn't.  I spent like 20 bucks; because it was worthless at the time.  No one knew that they would be worth $100/each, otherwise we all would have bought all of them that we could.
Spending thousands of dollars back then would have been sort of insane; since the chance of failure seemed so high.  Some people made that choice anyway and have profited amazingly from it; this is basic freemarket economics at play.  
I challenge you to come up with a distribution plan that would
1. Create value for the coins out of thin air
2. Be fair to everyone
3. Not piss anyone off
Are there better ways?  Maybe.  I haven'theard one.  You have to remember when bitcoin was getting started it the jury was still out on whether a currency like this could have value *at all*.  Now we just take it for granted that they are worth *something* but even that wasn't the case then.  Now that bitcoin has paved the way, so to speak, there are probably more options available for a cryto-currency starting today as there are certain barriers that don't need to be broken anymore.
Besides.. all this this hoopla and whining about bitcoin's distribution method is moot; since bitcoin *did* get distrubuted the way it did, it *did* work to bootstrap value out of thin-air, and people *are* using it; no amount of whining is going to stop it; the only thing that will stop it is something better; and that hasn't happened yet, and there is nothing stopping you from trying.

ok well please update when you find more; or let coinbase do it for you on your behalf

where did you have them sent to?  straight to the site you needed them for?  or did you get them sent to yourself somehow and then send them to the site?

SCAME ALERT.  brand new user with rhetoric that seems like he has been around the forums for a while.  not saying this is false; but first thing i did when i saw this story was check the user suspecting a new one.  sure enough "I just happened to make a new account to post on this forum even though I didn't have account even though I already read this all the time"
seems very suspicious

Assuming you can (relatively) easily do this; it would be *very* interesting to see what that graph looks like with various 'stop points' .. ie.. if you ran the same code say 3 months ago the projection would likely be wildly different.
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:29:21
you were clearly compromised; its okay for a random user to be in denial about it; but if you are opening a wallet you better have a damn good story for this as well as a solid security audit

It's not really the quality of the code from a "code" standpoint that is very impressive; but rather the quality of the protocol and the fact that it isn't buggy.
It's hard to really articulate it to a non-programmer; but there is a difference between the quality of the code and the quality of the program.  The code itself isn't particularly well designed from a the way we tend to view these things.. primarily the fact that it is tightly-coupled.
It's as if someone built a house and it stood up to a hurricane and had almost no heat leakage, etc etc etc.. but, when you actually look at it it isn't the most beautifully designed thing from an architectural standpoint.. but on all the actual measurable characteristics, it does a surprisingly good job.

I did a lot of drupalling years ago; I met Dries briefly and saw him speak a couple times.  
Solid head on his shoulders; the very best type of geek-celebrity.  I am honestly surprised it took him till late 2013...  but the question is, can I buy acquia services in bitcoin???!?
@_date: 2013-06-03 05:26:41
it seem so obvious.  i recommend looking into bitcoin-otc and modeling after that
