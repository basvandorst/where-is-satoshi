You know, from a different standpoint, Trump and his short sighted policies have very little to do with the current atmosphere. Housing bubble 2.0 and the shale bubble funded by junk bonds are what's going on.

Sure looks like any other bubbled asset or commodity.
Doesn't matter what it is, tulips were just the first clear instance. British railway mania. The south sea company. US in the 30's. Kuwait. Japan. Asian contagion. Dotcom. 2008 housing debt. Current corporate debt bubble.
This trick has been used by those with money to strip wealth away from anyone gullible to buy in. For centuries.
They just drained the money from every retiree and millennial stupid enough to buy on the way up.
Bitcoin was originally designed to be un-bubbleable, until they changed it.
See Bitcoin Cash.

Maybe. I think we only get to see glimpses of what's really going on. I just saw a pop density map on r/mapporn that made me legit upset.
You just can't do the things these east Asian countries are doing, at the rate and with the sheer cruelty and disregard for their environment that they're doing..
This has been baked into the cake for the last 8 years. I wish we hadn't done QE 1, QE 2, QE 3, or Operation Twist.
And only now with Powell are we getting back to responsible and feasible for long term stability. 
Like, on one hand I'm asking if intelligence agencies know something we don't about the current state of economic warfare. On the other, is Trump's seemingly nonsensical speech intentional to deceive non-fluent speakers or analysts? I just don't know. I don't know if I want to know..
