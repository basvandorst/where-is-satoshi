Haha I'm an idiot so didn't notice that. If I didn't have to work I'd have enjoyed engaging with the superiority complex.

this feels like some legendary copypasta.

my reference to vacationing alone was the sarcasm, not your post. But alas this seems to be a pointless conversation so ill leave it there - hope you have a nice day friend!

Quite the bizarre response there - but how do you know i spend my vacations alone!? 
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:30:16
and yet despite all of your PhD and professor friends, sarcasm is lost on you - case dismissed.

We can give him aeroplanes but "nearly every new technology" is pretty hilarious....and exactly what id expect to hear from an american.

you appear to have just rehashed your original statement. If we are using the context "credit where credit is due" then you're still incorrect, since the majority of the inventions you mention are not credited to having been invented by an american?

Haha it is strange. Im sure you can tell from my correct spelling of aeroplane that i too am British - maybe its because deep down, they are kinda British? Just a spoilt variant

Tis a question only you can answer friend as you're the only one that knows all your circumstances, alternatively go speak to a person that knows about finance, not us lot :)

Congrats. Best thing I can say is ask yourself how much of that you'd be willing to throw straight into a dumpster fire and still be able to look yourself in the mirror every morning- that's how diverse you should be

Everyones risk tolerance is different, its up to you what youre prepared to risk. On the one extreme weve got that bitcoin guy who is 100% all in - id say his risk tolerance is legendary, but cant say i recommend following that plan.
