Did you reply to the right comment? Luck with what?

Let me know when you're ready to back up anything you say. Generally assets that swing 50% are considered volatile.

yea man..we did..maybe you weren't here end of 2017, beginning of 2018.
and you were wrong about the volatility of fiat..by a factor of about 4..according to your own link.
this is an old thread, going to leave it in the past, but I hope you figure it out bud, good luck.

I'd be surprised if anyone who reads this doesn't realize how clueless you are. Wait till Reddit shows the comment scores on the people calling out your nonsense.

How did you refute the point? You said this a few comments up, the difference between 3.5% and 0.5-1% isn't pedantry, sorry. You are simply wrong.

You said only 4 people realized your lapses in logic, yet the posts calling you out have tons up upvoted with suggests more people realized you don't know anything.

Just stop, if everyone here realizes that your posts are nonsense it's not a failure of our reading comprehension, it's a failure in your logic. 
Take an intro accounting class on Coursera, you are using words that you simply do not understand.

When was the last time the dollar crashed more than 50% within a month? Or 25% for that matter. I'm super bullish on crypto and bearish on the dollar but don't be an idiot.

Ha, I guess money != education. You use accounting terms without knowing what they mean.
Are you proud of the fact that you are rich yet still can't manage to learn basic shit?

lol, did you actually read the page you linked me to?


Bitcoin volatility is ~4.6%
Also, these are only 30 and 60 measures, so it's not taking into account the massive dip at the beginning of the year. 50% dips do not happen in dollar/euro/yen markets.
edit: scroll down on the page you linked, the volatility went higher than 8% this year.
