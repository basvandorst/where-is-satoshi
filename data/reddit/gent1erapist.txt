This shit is hilarious. Yeah right, Coinbase would indiscriminately hand out the contents of their cold wallet because an entry in their internal database told them so.

THere is a post that says "happy friday the 13th" and another from "assbot" that says "02:03:25assbot:Logged on 13-11-2015 00:44:18". 
I don't know the context of either of these post, but it appears that the log is from November 13. So this info has been out for over a month.
*lol, it says transcript for 13-11-2015 at the top too.

You need to learn how to invest. Dumping your whole stash into bitcoin at $800 was stupid, you should have averaged in and bought on the dips. If you would have done that, you would most likely already be in the black.

If/When bitcoins price stabilizes and people worldwide gain confidence in it, demand will come from its use as a hedge against rampant inflation.
Also, there are several other reasons people would want Bitcoins:
* - your government cannot steal your bitcoins (remember Cyprus)
*- participate in illicit markets
* - transfer money around the world at virtually no cost
* - the ton of unrealized possibilities of the protocol
Edit: Shit, I cant format
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:28:04
The inflation rate is somewhat irrelevant because we know that there will never be more than 24million bitcoin (I think). The USD's upper limit is infinity.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:13:15
That sucks bro. 
This is what you should do next time - open up a snapswap account and withdraw you bitstamp USD through there. Transfer your bitstamp USD to ripple then sell it for snapswap USD. The good thing about doing this is that Bitstamp USD sell at a premium, so you wil make about an extra 5% doing this. Then withdraw to your bank account from SnapSwap (1% fee).

It'a pretty amazing that in Chiina, when a market collapsed occurs, the government creates policies that move money from Rich---&gt;Poor. When something like this happens in the West the opposite occurs.

The only path to adequate liquidity is higher prices. Liquidity is a joke at these price levels  , we're going to need buying and much higher prices if we want reasonable liquidity, it's as simple as that.

I don't know the whole situation, but preventing large shareholders from selling is definitely the opposite of transferring wealth from the poor to the rich. This isn't the first time it has happened.

The only point of them is to increase profit margins for the banks. They don't compete with bitcoin at all.

The buy and sell demand is not there, low prices exacerbate that problem. There are only going to be 21 million bitcoin ever, we need higher demand for btc which will equal higher prices and better liquidity.

Exchanges aren't popular around r/bitcoin, but look, Okcoin is a "professional" bitcoin exchange (by today's standards), run by professionals, with real investment from venture capital firms. IMO they have proven themselves over the years, I have personally held BTC and USD in their exchange everyday for the past 1 and 1/2  years without issue. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:39:12
The bullshit politics has really become tiresome, this sub is almost unreadable now. Grow the fuck up and let discussion happen. Any possible fork of bitcoin is bitcoin related and belongs in r/bitcoin, let the discussion happen.

Cryptofacillities is great, they have quarterly expiring contracts up to 9 month out (i think), but the quarterly contracts aren't available in the US due to regulatory reasons.

No, bitcoin is the Youtube of crypto.

NO, you;re going to have to wait for the the price to trade at par, then buy the BTC back, but at this rate that may never happen, lol

The answer to this is Genesis Trading. They do require account verification though.

Another lame analogy. I would take a 1.75% worldwide currency market share though, sounds good! What's the market share for BTC among crypto-currency? 99.995%

Purse facilitates those transactions and also guarantees them. If most transactions were found to be fraudulent, they would shut down quickly. Additionally, users of purse.io would be reporting the massive fraud occurring as Amazon would surely contact them first and likely seek compensation.

I think you missed the point of my post or you're trying to create an argument where there is none. If BTC is as successful as Linux is, that would be fantastic.

He said


That is anything but hyperbole, more over, you then go on too say "while localbitcoins data is impressive", which indicates that you understand it is not hyperbole. He finishes his post by saying, "The future is bright. We all have ALOT of work to do to make things simpler," that is very level headed. I don't know what motivated you to post the rest of your unrelated content, but nobody ever mentioned paypal. This news is good relative to bitcoins' past, paypal has nothing to do with it. 
Your middle paragraph is also irrelevant, it is an attempt by you to downplay LBC's consistent USD growth.

This doesn't change much, they weren't really a "Bitcoin Company" in the first place. Assuming they still except BItcoin, the only thing that changed is their name.

Best quote from the original thread:
"Good Luck OP. However, I still don't think future is positive for bitcoin as long as people think it as investment rather than instrument. I rather invest that money in Gold or Euro right now. "

I would think they hold most of their funds in cold storage, so the loss depends on the size of their hot wallet.
@_date: 2015-10-11 16:49:56
You used a lot of words to not really say anything. If he believes this is "just beginning to open the gates to real mainstream bitcoin adoption" , so be it. That is one man's opinion, it is not a quantifiable fact, and is definitely not hyperbole. Again, your post is pretty much irrelevant, USD growth is steady on LBC.

If fiat transfers between USD and CNY are possible, that would be very interesting.

You can't buy gift card with gift cards.


Amazon has a fraud department, items take time to ship, I'm sure many CC orders are intercepted.


Pure hyperbole, you really do yourself a disservice when you say stupid shit like this. 
So it looks like your main qualm is CC fraud. I doubt that there is much successful C C fraud. The person placing the order has to have an Amazon prime account which is another barrier. And like I said, We would have tons of reports of fraud from users, Amazon would contact them and might file police reports. Saying that the majority of transactions are fraudulent is extremely speculative, you have no evidence. Anyway, I don't care to discuss this shit any more.

That market has no liquidity. Additionally, There is no US gateway with a banking relationship. My main interest is BTC arbitrage between Chinese and USD exchanges; I can already get CNY exposure by selling on any Chinese exchange.

In order for BTC to gain liquidity price must go up, that is indisputable. Three are only 21 million BTC , while fiat has a comparatively infinite supply. Good liquidity is not possible at low prices.

For a while, when usd snapsnap and usd bitstamp were trading 1:1, snapswap was the best way to get USD to bitstamp for US residents. It's a shame that they shutdown in the us, their deposit fees had also gotten very

Appeals to authority are very popular on reddit. A lot of smart people say stupid things, that's made clear by some of these quotes in the OP. My point is there is no point being made by Sagan. His poorly worded statement isn't even relevant here; Bitcoin has already made fools out of many people, it is very sucessful; How successful it becomes remains to be seen.

I asked an associate in the past, and he said that the fees are built into price and they are generally the same as the major exchanges. I've never actually used their service, but I've heard good things. I use itBit, which could serve your purpose too; they allow wires deposits and withdraws.

This statement is not consistent with reality. A business that receives most of its proceeds via fraud does not last. It is clear that there is a large legitimate gift card resale market.
