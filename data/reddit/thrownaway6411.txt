No, his coins are already on the market as they've been mined.  They can be used at any time.  Just because they're inactive, doesn't mean they aren't part of the supply.  
I've had coins for 4 years now, some of which have never been used from when they were mined, it doesn't remove them from the supply.


Yes, in fact, I do understand supply and demand.  The supply of coins, doesn't change if satoshi buys something with coins.  The supply of coins increases in a pretty predictable manner.   .


This is an assumption, not a fact.  I wouldn't sell my coins just because satoshi used some of his.  If people did panic, I'd probably be a buyer, since the underlying supply and use case of bitcoins would be the same as it was the day before.

Interesting, I've bought and sold to a couple different pawn shops, never had to show ID for a bullion transaction.

Pretty simple, launder your coins.
1) Buy gold on provident metals with bitcoin, have it shipped to a P.O. box that is forwarded to another P.O. Box which is then forwarded to third anonymous P.O. Box which you can access.  
2) Take the gold to a pawn shop/jewelry store.  
3) Exchange for actual cash that you can use more anonymously than bitcoin, walk into tesla dealership, pay cash.  
4) Drive home happy, you're satoshi.

I'm not understanding why the value of bitcoin would tank if his coins move?  Satoshi isn't a reserve bank, he's a user of a protocol.  If his coins move, so what?

So, he'd need to go to a bank and prove he owns those coins to get credit issued with them as collateral?... this means he'd have to acknowledge his identity to do so.   You don't get bank loans without putting a name on the application.
My way is much more effective, he gets the tesla, no one knows his identity.

that doesn't preclude it from being an elaborate smokescreen.

Financial commodity vs. Food commodity.  Different regulatory rules.

I called and got a message in what I think was Mandarin, looks like they're out of our jurisdiction.  If only we had some kind of recourse against international wrongdoing, amirite?

I like steam.  Don't speak for me boss.
@_date: 2016-02-18 12:57:39
Then call them up and complain. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:11:11
Give me their number, I'll call them and complain.  I can't find it anywhere.

Bitcoin lending makes no sense to me, why would you ever MAKE a loan to someone else in a currency designed to be deflationary?  
Lender - "Here's your 1000BTC for your new house"
Buyer - "Awesome" - goes and buys house from seller with 1000BTC
Lender - "OK, you owe me 3.0BTC monthly for 30 years."
Buyer - "Cool"  ... *six months pass and buyer makes 3.0BTC payments monthly*  So far the lender has 18BTC back from the buyer.
*Meanwhile, BTC is deflationary and will now buy twice as much house, you know, because it's deflationary as adoption increases.  So a new house now costs 500BTC*.  Remember,  Pizza used to cost 10,000 BTC in 2010, now it's like .05BTC.  The same would hold true for a house.
Buyer - "Hey, my house is only worth 500BTC now, but I still owe like 982BTC on my loan and the currency keeps deflating...  There's no way I'm going to keep making payments"... *stops making payments*
Lender - "Dude, make your payments or we will foreclose."
Buyer - "I'm not paying 982BTC for a house that will sell for 500BTC."
Lender - *forecloses*
Lender - Sells house at a huge loss, decides not to make loans in deflationary currencies moving forward.  With no one making loans, the value of everyone elses house falls further.

It could be a smokescreen, if the court order itself is fake and used to make terrorists feel more comfortable using apple tech which already has backdoors installed.

I know, it's almost like we need one to keep someone from gaming the system.
@_date: 2016-02-17 14:20:52
It doesn't take a lot of people to plan and execute this.  It takes one person at a high level to make a phone call to the court to start going after apple.  The AG can literally pick up the phone and do this at any time.  The court actually thinks they're doing the right thing for the right reasons so there's no questions and plausible deniability.  The court doesn't even know they're part of the conspiracy.
Then, this same person calls Tim and says, "Hey, you're going to get a call from the courts, we want you to fight them, in the meantime, put in a backdoor to let us catch terrorists.  It'll be good publicity for your company and help us catch terrorists, in other words, it's a win win.  You get to "look" like a hero to people for privacy rights, and you get to be a hero in catching terrorists."
Then, once Tim agrees, this same person calls the already operating counter terrorism unit and tells them they've got the backdoor.

Let's call them up and complain... Oh wait, we wanted anonymity. Damn costs of freedom.
