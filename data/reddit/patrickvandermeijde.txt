Most altcoins we have seen in the past prove otherwise.

I try to use bitcoin as much as possible, but for some things I still need a bank account (I have a mortgage for example). But I do weekly bitcoin payments for just about anything (not using any form of plastic card).

You are doing it wrong. You should buy the bitcoins you need to spend in advance if you think the rate will rise in the future. :)

All the merchants that use BitKassa will be able to process LN transactions very soon (pilots are successfully running now). However it will take a while before users will adopt as well. The number of mobile wallets supporting LN is also quite slim at the moment.
Asking for ID is an option, but a lot of hassle. In The Netherlands credit card payments are extremely rare as everyone pays with debit card (though NFC), asking for an ID would be highly unusual if you just paid some groceries.
Although I agree RBF should be default some day, for us it is a bit too soon.

I am co-founder of BitKassa a dutch payment processor that is for instance being used by almost all merchants in Arnhem Bitcoin City. We recently had a customer trying to pay with Green at a restaurnt, which was not accepted because we don't take RBF transactions for 0-conf payments. I was hoping it would be just a setting in Green.
So for online-payments I think RBF should be the default, but for point-of-sale payments not.

Why choose?

Can you please make RBF optional? I believe I can't use any RBF features in the current version or am I missing it?
@_date: 2019-04-17 14:14:16
Yes because transactions for point-of-sale payments will not be accepted if RBF is turned on. (at least if the merchant is aware of the risk, and yes I am aware that 0-conf payments are never risk-free)

If no one accepts bitcoins, no merchants wants to keep them. But when a lot of merchants accept bitcoins (even if they exchange it to euros) more merchants will keep bitcoins themselves, which is exactly what is happening in Arnhem.

Some places make it a little easier for bitcoin travelers:
I hope she will visit those as well

hehe you win :) December 2015, I thought they only mentioned bitcoin on their receipts months later. Fanny how the gas price is exactly the same.

That would indeed be awesome but it would require actual integration with their cashier system, which would take quite some effort.

I hope this inspires more people to set up something like this. I hope to visit Rovereto some time soon, awesome job guys!

Why is the QR code printed on paper and how does the cashier get feedback whether or not the transactions has been sent?
@_date: 2018-07-15 06:19:35
I'd rather unbank everyone else.
@_date: 2018-04-23 08:04:34
Why do you think that?
