Then buying loads of Bitcoin, right now would be a very expensive gamble because it's still at its inflationary stage. 
The second thing was just mistaken. There's no point trying to clog up the mempool by placing sell-orders on exchanges because all those transactions are done off-chain anyway.

Wallets use different exchanges, and prices aren't always the same on the exchanges.

I still wouldn't do it though. Spend/trade altcoins, keep Bitcoin for now.

Not a chance. 
Long term, when the value increases 1-2% per year rather than whatever crazy percentage it is now, it would make sense to use it to purchase goods.
Short term, you'll be kicking yourself if you spend it.

Printing money doesn't happen in vacuum, it has real world effects. If a central bank wants to destroy its own currency/country just to buy some Bitcoin, let them.
If it gets to the point they are doing that, Bitcoin has basically won so it's pretty moot.

The wallet doesn't devalue it. The price is just relative depending on the exchange you use. So if you bought on Coinbase and your wallet connects to Kraken, you'll see the Kraken praise which could be +\- the Coinbase price. 
Your Bitcoin hasn't lost its value.

Noted. But I'm not sure why some one these subs seem to be bothered about altcoins as if they are a threat; the overall crypto currency market is growing, so it's only natural for bitcoin's share of the market to nominally shrink even if liquidity increases. 
And it makes sense for some of the speculative cash to move to altcoins in search of better arbitrage opportunities.

I'd agree with that too. But I think all that means is that rather than saying altcoins suck in general, it's worth considering them on their individual merits.
