How would capital controls and stingy regulations cause them to trade at a premium? 
Tougher to get USD in, coins trade at discount. Why do you think btc-e had the cheapest coins for years?

Bitcoin didn't IPO at a specified market cap. So it can easily experience exponential growth.

Centralized botnet wallet developed with Israeli connections requiring far too many permissions. Identity and location? Top lol. No doubt involved in deanonymizing users and transactions. 
If you're not using a P2P mobile wallet you're contributing to the corruption of crypto.

No. Largely shady company. Offline paper wallets better.
