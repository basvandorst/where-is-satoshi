You are cool.
They fought over AC and DC due to royalites? $$$$$$
AC vs DC is an amazing tech advancement. ($$)
That's all that matters. This whole Crypto Bullshit is people making rich in FIAT. (They apparently hate FIAT)
We are here again.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:07:25
Crypto for ever but all I really care about is how it converts to FIAT. 
I can use FIAT to actually buy stuff. 
Get real and let go of it

It is even a small amount of people "controlling" the space.
Decentralised is a lie.

Regulation is inbound. It's over
No regulation is Anarchy with money.
Good luck with that.

Now everyone is making 4000% gains in hours in 
 Altcoins....
Where does that leave Bitcoin?
Honestly... 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:50:00
I have literally seen thousands of these worthless transactions. Is it an attack? A flaw? Bot March?
What are they trying to acheive?
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:59:10
Okay, Now it is 0.00000086.
Are you telling me this is just gonna end up being bots doing micro-transactions non-stop for fractional gain in the future. 
Sure starting to feel like it. Inevitable I suppose.

Is this the dawn of SKYNET?
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:47:51
So this is some sort of manipulation?
This is not right. I hope the authorities can step in... Ohh hang on
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:11:27
hahah that's funny.
It's mostly Bots dude. Bots don't eat,sleep or stop.
The bots are buying and selling to themselves. It will stop when the bots are pulled.

There are many things in this world that are more important and better than making as much money as fast as possible. 
What you have just made me realise Crytpo has become no different to what we already have now, just with larger daily margins and profits and losses. It will be regulated and controlled. I'll enjoy the ride while it lasts.

This bot or whatever is ridiculous. Nearly 1/2 the Trade History - Buy orders completed were for 0.00000087. Hahah
5 in a row. wow. If this happens over and over can this crash GDAX and Coinbase?
LOOK over 1/2 the friggin page is 87 Satoshi buys
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:36:29
Later on it would be 5-6 trades in a row of 0.00000087
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:18:28
I'd like to think it's not a bot, but someone puting in 87 satoshis every few seconds trying to build up their wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:35:30
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:12:13
Fair enough. I just thought Bitcoin would be different to the all the stock exchanges around the world. It is all about making as much money as fast as possible I guess.
I guess a huge network of bots constantly profiteering in nanoseconds across multiple stock exchanges using arbitrage and other various markets and means, is an amazing human achievement.
I just wish I was one of those humans involved Haha.

Why can't I just post a pic or a screenshot?
