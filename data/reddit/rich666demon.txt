Thank you, I'm feeling relieved
@_date: 2017-01-11 05:02:20
Thank you for kind words, I might and I think I have used the wrong words to describe what I really meant, I'm one of those few who were able to make it, despite all the adversity, although a lot more people I know are struggling and are unable to save or have given up hopes on achieving anything.
I myself don't look at life at what people have, I rather look at them in the perspective of who they are, and the truth is I meant to say that for some much bigger blessing is being born in an easier place. We will never know what's the best for whom, because different situations provide different results, although for me my personal dream always was to live in the sunniest english speaking place in the world, which is either U.S. or Australia :)
Goodluck to you too kind stranger!

I'm jealous, although If I were you I would have been more happy that I was born in US than anything else, it's a much bigger win, than most of things. For example I was born In Poland, and things get a lot more harder and complicated, although who knows maybe it's for the good, they say that the experience is priceless.

We'll you're lucky it could go up as well, anyways, it's the panic selling moment currently, and when it ends it should go up again. I will be selling some at 1200$

Ikr, fresh milk is more than money
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:17:12
I seen so much ups and downs that I stopped caring about money that I have nothing to spend it on anyways. Yes I could spend it on pointless things, but by buying shit you support people who make shit and I don't want that.

Lambos are looking cool and all, but my dream car has been tesla for a few years now, especially that now they have auto pilot. Also there's not many years until gasoline cares will be banned.

True story: I got fever when bitcoin was at it lowest but I didn't give up and overcome.
P.s. Bitcoin will succeed
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:34:10
I don't know but it's the first time I'm happy that I lose money... Price was going so high that I was getting anxious. It's better to see many small corrections than one big one.
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:20:23
I are $
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:27:30
Also I think the wisest is to first set your own goal where bitcoin most likely hits one day, and then sell slowly as it approaches the goal, plus leave some bitcoin in case it goes way higher :)

Of Those who remember 10$ times or less Im jealous

I would have way more profit if greed didn't guide me, but it's been three times already, and I've learned my lesson
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:13:49
Ive spent 15k, been there done that, crashes or rapid growth dont move me, only moon would.
@_date: 2017-05-21 17:23:53
I made quite a profit but It would have been much bigger if It wasn't for my greed, I had a plan to sell half of my bitcoin when they first time hit 1300$, they did - I didn't sell, they fell down to 800$, and I told myself fuck next time it hits I'm selling, they got to 1300$ again, I didn't sell, bitcoin fell down to 900$.
If I sold when I was supposed to, I would have bought more bitcoin with the profit, but I didn't although I told myself third time it goes up I'm selling, I sold 2/3 at 1350$, and it is still going up :D
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:38:28
I thought the bubble was at 1350$ and sold 2/3 of my bitcoin, I'd have 3 times the profit if I didn't sell :), I thought it was a good decision back then, after having fucked up twice before.
