Hey my first bit penny was at 6950, then in for my daily max at 7138 today. We're later than we could be, but there's still plenty of upward adjustment left

$1.23 when btc hits $100k sometime in 2019
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:52:03
Yeah but eventually there will be 21

I read an article estimating btc total cap in 10 yrs, and adjusted the btc market share to what I think it'll be. I probably misstated something because I mainly don't know or understand anything

Well I googled it and it seems I'm right. En.bitcoin.it/wiki/casascius_physical_bitcoins says the first person to peel off the sticker gets its private key. If you're in it for the sticker, obviously don't destroy the sticker. If you want the btc, you have to peel back the sticker.

Yeah, I'm playing the long game. And paying for stuff on the Internet really really easily

I figure eventual market cap will be about $350 billion, so under this assumption is a good buy up to about $17k/btc. It could be way more, especially as global news makes ppl aware of the risk of central banks.

Just open it and transfer it to a wallet

$100k by 2020 hodl
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:00:22
Yeah idk what that thing he has is, and am assuming the key to the coin is under the sticker

70% of 500 billion average daily volume. Should be a pretty conservative estimate.

They'd want to outlaw it, and they might slow progress a bit, but I'm confident the government would be fighting a losing battle. 
And, the us government gets most of its money from payroll tax. Corporations are incentivized to report payroll costs to the irs, so they should be good as long as ppl will work for other ppl.

The best the government could do to stop torrents is cheesy you wouldn't steal a... movie intros. They can't stop the btc if they wanted to. At worst they could shut down an exchange, but if you move your coin to your wallet the gmen can't get it. They can still get you for tax evasion though, so pay your taxes.

Me too! I was in for my daily limit at 7138!
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:29:58
What about stuff I buy with btc directly?
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:06:09
I bet you wish you'd have bought at 7000 now that it's 7200!!1!
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:22:45
I get 16,666.66, assuming 21,000,000 bit coins total
