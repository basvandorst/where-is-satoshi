Because once you understand Bitcoin's potential re global forex, card payments, remittances, store of value immune from enforced government bail-outs, etc, then factor in the limited supply of bitcoins (fixed at no more than 21 million ever), it becomes obvious that one day bitcoins will be worth a vast amount more than they are today.

The Kubler Ross five stages of grieving will also be the stages that bankers and economists in the pay of governments will go through in coming to terms with Bitcoin.

There's another downside to trusting a third party to store your bitcoins for you.  These services can effectively do off-chain transactions.  'Moving' bitcoin from my wallet with them to your wallet with them doesn't have to involve actually moving coins on the blockchain, just changing my balance and your balance of how many bitcoins the third party owes each of us.
This is bad news for speculators who want to see the price of bitcoin rise, because it increases the velocity of bitcoin.  The greater the velocity of bitcoin, the lower it's exchange rate to fiat is likely to be.
