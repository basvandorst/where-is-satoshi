My name is Roger Ver, long time Bitcoin advocate and investor. Today I'm at an undisclosed location with the Mt. Gox CEO, Mark Karpeles.
I asked him about the current WizSec Investigation, leaked emails, scam allegations and whistleblowers. He assured me that all of these are part of a FUD campaign by Bitcoin wales. When I asked about bank statements, he posed for me in multiple angles in nude, as well as in multiple lingeries he purchased from Evolution Marketplace. This proves that Mt. Gx is solvent and the $20.000 Bitcoin is a close reality, putting to bed all the negative rumours (FUD).
I'm sure that all the current FUD around the page being not accessible is being caused by the traditional hosting system that Reddit.com uses.

Take a look at Japan's recent history. Deflation made the already-saving Japanese into hoarders, and effectively suffocated their economy. It's all about incentives, really. Incentive to save, and the economy stops dead. Spending incentives make it turn 'round like a big wheel. You'd want a medium, though. Not too much to one side (deflation) or to the other (inflationary spiral).

"The indictment makes these points repeatedly. Megaupload wasn't just some Hong Kong enterprise that "happened" to be used by US residents. The site had leased more than 1,000 servers in North America alone; 525 were at Carpathia Hosting and were located in Virginia. Between 2007 and 2010, Carpathia received $13 million from Megaupload. (Cogent Communications in the US supplied a few additional US servers and bandwidth.)
The money was mainly routed through US-based PayPal, which is how Megaupload collected subscriptions from users looking for premium accounts. This wasn't chump change; the government claims that the Megaupload PayPal account has "received in excess of $110,000,000 from subscribers and other persons associated with Mega Conspiracy."
Megaupload also made money through ads, using services like Google's AdSense (until 2007) and the AdBrite network. Both are based in the US. AdBrite alone paid at least $840,000 to Megaupload.
Payments were made to top uploaders, including those who lived in Virginia. "

There's no market for bitcoin in Brazil. If anything, people would, and do, buy dollars. Things are bad, but I think it would take the dissolution of the New Republic state for bitcoin to be slightly relevant, specially with so much of the cash flow of the lower 80% being from welfare.

This is key to the issue. Namely, perception being aligned to reality is not a happy accident. It is built into the design of regulatory agencies. Their perception of success is tied to their results, as they can't advertise or change public opinion in  any meaningful way. 


But if it did, who would define their stringency?  


I have no doubt the free market would be able to eliminate 98% of gross food safety threats. It's in the home stretch that a gov agency shines, as few legislators can go back to their home districts and say: "Yeah, we'll accept a 0.00001% chance that your meat might have a deadly parasite because it saves 100 million dollars for big fast food chains, and it'll cost just 20 mil to settle it out of court"


Yes, I see your point there. Nevertheless, the challenge of issuing purity ratings to a niche metal market are in a totally different league from the most important resource of all: food.


The USDA can just swoop down on one farm and demand that the meat be inspected. They are federal agents, after all. A private corporation would have to ask, or worse, have to be asked to enter a farm, which could refuse on any number of grounds. If we assume that a certification would have to be paid, then that farm, with its questionable wares, would have an unfair advantage. Now, we may argue all day about the merits of customer information, but at the end of the day some poor (literally) sap is going to eat some cheap, questionable meat, and die.


And then thousands of people wouldn't have lost millions of dollars. Which is why the regulations exist in the first place. They can't protect you from losses, but at least they can protect you from having your savings or checking account from being raided by the bank.


You juxtapose the poorly-run, non-regulated Mt. Gox with the professionaly-run, (mostly) compliant Coinbase, in a defense of no regulations?

Actual accuracy is not as important as *perceived* accuracy to businesses. 


Indeed. Yet, how can we know that Yelp didn't delete positive reviews from that restaurant because they didn't pay up? Or that they deleted negative reviews from the restaurant you ultimately went to?


Interesting. In a cursory read through Wikipedia, however, I found this:


Take it or leave it, but to me it shows that private certs are far more subjective and flexible than official certification.


That's a very specific niche, and connected to historic groups (jewelers and bullion traders). This also doesn't address my point: even if food can be analyzed at the end of the chain, there would be no authority to analyze it on the top. So there could be bogus organiztions selling false security to people.


A vibrant market in this specific situation is way more undesirable than a government monopoly. After all, who would you trust? Just look at bitcoin today. Many people trusted Mt. Gox, and, in near-absence of regulation, they lost immense amounts of money.


You are right, of course. In retrospect, that was a very weak analogy.

And yet it has built the largest world and military power in the world. It's interesting that you count the US dollar's loss of value as a bug. If anything, 3.2% losses a year are more desirable than a 57% loss of value in the same time period.

But there is mutual trust there, as in Amazon trusting the credit card company to pay them in the end, and the credit card company having a number of ways for getting their money back, such as legal action. Bitcoin isn't trust-based, and, as we've seen in the past, Bitcoin companies can be very untrustworthy.

But in that period (2011) the main purpose of Bitcoin was to buy illegal drugs and a insignificant number of other things, making it, in essence, a speculative asset, hardly comparable to the US dollar, in which pretty much every natural resource is priced.


The same once was said about Japan, in the 80's. Nevertheless, it's a reasonable argument. I'd say that China benefits extensively from a rich US due to their largely export-based economy. I'd also argue that, should the US stop being the proeminent power in the world, there wouldn't be any other nation to pick up the slack, no matter how high their GDP.


At which point does it stop being a start-up?

There's little need to speculate. Let's look at an organization that bears a slight resmblance to a certifier you propose: Yelp. While they don't directly certify (review, in this case), they have a similar function in the market. A significant part of their revenue comes directly from the diner they feature. 
But, why would anyone pay Yelp, if they are badly reviewed? Nobody would, so those that do pay have a leg up on others, not only in receiving better, even if questionable, reviews, while having negative reviews removed. Keep in mind, though, that the main purpose of Yelp is to review the taste of food, not its edibleness.
As for the incentives of government workers: they have a duty to report, and their pay and continued employment is not at all a concern. A private worker, on the other hand, may report an issue, only to have his employer discard it because they have a large contract with the reportee. For example: McDonald's, in the US, buys American beef, USDA regulated. If restrictions were lifted, they would have an incentive to source foreign, lower quality meat, with, say, a 95% chance of being infected with whatever, at least for some of their burgers. There would be no one to stop them from doing it, as USDA would have been, effectively, declawed. Would a private certifier go against the largest fast food chain in the world? I think not. The USDA? Would, and has, in the past.
A similar case is Moody's, and S&amp;P. They received money for sending AAA ratings, and did, being handsomely paid in the process.
