Wages are sticky down - they can easily rise, but are slow to decrease.

Thanks for the bitcoin superstore link, it proves everything I needed it to. 
Notice how the prices are given in USD? That's because Bitcoin is not the unit of account. If I walk into a shop and ask "how much for this widget?" they are going to answer "x dollars," not "0.00x bitcoin." That's what being the unit of account means. Bitcoin is not used as the unit of account. Goods are priced in dollars, and then that price is instantaneously converted to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is far too volatile to function as the unit of account or a store of value. If I have $100 I know that in 2 years time it's worth about $100, give or take some inflation which is countered by interest anyway. If I have $100 worth of Bitcoin, who the fuck knows what it's gonna be worth in 2 years time? I can't reliably predict it and plan around it, so it's useless as a store of value.
This also shows that Bitcoin is not being used as a means of exchange. You are not exchanging money for goods. You are exchanging Bitcoin for real money, and then using the real money to buy goods. You send Bitcoin to bitcoinsuperstore, they sell it for money, they use the money to buy goods. You're still buying things with USD.
If I sell a bottle of 1982 bordeaux for USD, and then use those USD to buy myself dinner, I can't claim that 1982 Bordeaux is actually a currency. But that's what you are doing with Bitcoin. It's not the unit of account, it's not a store of value, and it's not a mean of exchange. It does nothing that we want money to do.

Dollars can be exchanged for bitcoins.

Wow crazy I guess past performance does guarantee future returns, I wonder why nobody has ever tried this investment strategy before.

Why are you measuring the value of Bitcoin in USD? Is it because the USD functions as the unit of account and Bitcoin doesn't?

But at the end of the day I've successfully proven Bitcoin is not money. And that's what matters.

Wow how revolutionary it does nothing that I want money to do.

Diversify ni��️��️a. Putting all your retirement savings in one asset class is dumb.

That's still not diversified, all the crypto currencies moves roughly together. If harsh new anti-crypto regulations were announced, every coin would crash, not just one or two. 
It's like investing your life savings in the fijian stock market and claiming you're diversified because you invested in multiple fijian companies. That doesn't matter, because if there's a coup or natural disaster in Fiji you're still fucked.
