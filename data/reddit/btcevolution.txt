Yes!!! Same problem!! I was pretty pissed! Worst part is, when you click to resend the email, it counts as a login attempt!! Ahh!!

Thanks! Yeah I've been a reader since the last boom started. 
I'll check out the list, appreciate the footwork! All my past experiences with smaller services taking bitcoin is that the services disappear after a while.

They steal my money too many ways, foremost through inflation. We could all stop paying taxes and let them try and print their way out.
I'm sorry but no ones stealing anymore of my money, its why some of us like and use bitcoin. 
I sure hope everyone in the world uses bitcoin as a "tax haven" good luck "patriots" ..suckers.

LOL like congress controls the NSA. -Point taken though.

I'm not %100 positive, but if it says it was completed, I think that might possibly be a mt.gox redeem code u posted here on reddit, better take it down quick I've seen them being stolen before by people who were oblivious an posted them! Thought I'd tell u rather than attempting to redeem it myself ;) hope it hasn't been pilfered yet..

Technically speaking, all crypto currencies are FIAT. And USD is already a digital currency, the bank notes only represent a small portion. And regulation means fee's, I doubt they would ever let it go p2p, governments hate transparency.

Lol us? Biased? Lol no way. We're just always right!

What a jackass!! The caption: "this doesn't even look like a computer to me."
Alright smartass. Sorry we couldn't get a big metal box for u.

Sorry didn't mean that as an insult. I feel for your loss.

That's ridiculous it was called a bubble very early on, it just took 5 years to peak. 
I'm not downvoting for your spelling; I hold no prejudices. It's just simply not true.

I was using text for a while then it occurred to me, if for some reason I lose my phone or my credit card doesn't go through to pay my phone bill I'm Fucked. Same logic for google authenticator. Email verification isn't perfect, but its more protection than a single password offers. And I don't save my passwords in browsers etc, that's usually how they're attained by hackers (or so I'm told.)

Good Ferengi
@_date: 2013-05-14 13:27:41
I think you mean simply changing the name of the next increment to "bitcoin."
It's been thoroughly discussed, and seems like a viable option for the future.

Market forces are reflected in the price. If you find an affordable and easy way to turn gox USD into BTC-e USD then I am all ears. Or rather PM me so we can get it on the action first ;)
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:08:53
Facepalm... Sorry. I'm new to reddit and it was REALLY late.. and I wasn't even %100 sure. 
Omg I fail so hard.
EDIT- I downvoted myself
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:09:03
If you're day trading on gox you're already doing it wrong. My opinion.
@_date: 2013-05-14 02:35:42
Does anyone have any suggestions for minimal/cheap/reliable hosting that I could pay with in bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:44:33
My buddy has one just like it, I'm sure he bought it somewhere along the RP campaign trail. Maybe libertopia, that's Austin's libertopia right?
@_date: 2013-05-16 03:37:12
Took me a minute to find it, here ya go. Get ready to rage puke.
@_date: 2013-05-14 02:57:42
Thanks for the response! Love your blog.
I was aware, just wondering if there were any other established options, and maybe something a bit cheaper since my needs are so minimal. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 09:39:35
Bitfloors prices are just a market response, the fees are generally much lower getting USD into bitfloor than Mt.Gox, and the price its trading at reflects that, at least that's my assumption.
@_date: 2013-04-04 08:08:46
But I can't pay with bitcoin :(
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:42:33
UPDATE: with one try left, I waited an hour, this time it didn't even give me the option to put the verification code in, it just locked me out. It didn't have any trouble sending THAT email.. SHIT!!
@_date: 2013-05-04 08:11:22
Anyone who's reading this who *hasn't* read or listened to Stefan's philosophy should definitely do so, especially regarding relationships.
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:42:37
It locks u out for x amount of time, I didn't bother to look how long, I was able to access through my blockchain android app before I was locked out to send the BTC so no harm done, but -balls!!

LOL. I'm not familiar with new Zealand's monetary system, but as far as I know banks already use digital currency. 
Most of the U.S. money supply only exists in 1's &amp; 0's
@_date: 2013-05-16 01:03:29
Mr. Forbes himself is very anti-bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 08:23:05
Trololol. Are u cointelpro or have all your arguments been foreal?
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:29:49
Ah. So now that you have your own rollercoaster, who cares about bitcoin? 
Haha.
