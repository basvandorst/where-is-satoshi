I agree. But if you think about it this way it is easier, if you don't sell or buy, you don't make or lose any money. Just hold until a time you are willing to sell at a profit. 
If you leave your Bitcoin alone over time it is likely to go back up in value

Why sell lol

They have a way to do it but I couldn't get it to work. First attempt it just said the service is temporarily available and to try again later. Second attempt they told me to call and verify my identity.
They have flagged my account multiple times for fraud based on so called weird purchases, like my Spotify and PSN (which I've had monthly re-occurring since 2014.) 
All in all, Wells Fargo just shits the bed in every aspect other than being accepted by most companies for payment.

did you get to buy?

Sorry I maybe appeared rude BTW lol. It wouldn't drop so it could be more affordable for people to buy. The price is increasing because it is in demand. It wouldn't make much sense for the price to decline for more people to get it because it wouldn't hold any value

I think I got it really close to there as well
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:43:38
Pssh, I've never seen this question in my life
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:32:35
I think that the price is going down because people are dumping, and other people are panic selling because of it.
I'm not quite sure what is going to happen on August 1st though, I'll have to give deference to the more seasoned bitcoiners.

Fuck if I know... I'll update you if I find out how. Kinda sucks cause coinbase is shit and even though GDAX is owned by the same people, it's somehow not as shit
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:59:56
This isn't really valid AT ALL.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:57:08
The thing is... You haven't​ technically lost anything at all. You only lose money when you panic sell. Just hodl and we'll all be ok.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:05:49
How do I do that lol
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:39:35
I do bank deposits and the funds are available instantly.
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:30:21
are you serious? for what reason?
ive transferred from WF to coinbase no problem other than coinbase's fees
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:08:37
Yep I moved to Gemini
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:06:19
ohh makes sense. thanks
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:53:58
Well yeah I mean that makes sense but the beginning of the dip you sold at could be a really bad time to sell, even if it's at the top of a dip. Because the price is going to start rising again, and when it does, that's a lot of profit gone
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:45:39
Gemini is currently active in 48 states. There is competition. Many users are even switching to Gemini because of Coinbase's sketchy servers. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:05:53
yeah my app wont even let me log in. i somehow got a purchase through my pc tho
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:47:04
Wells Shitgo wouldn't let me do wire transfer, so I did bank transfer. I did 250 deposit 2x and it was instant both times. I'm not sure why yours wouldn't be. Are you sure you have available funds?
