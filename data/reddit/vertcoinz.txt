My argument would be that you the trend is going downward still. There is a likelyhood that BTC will see the 200's and your investment will be cut in half of what it could have been. There's always the phrase that comes to mind, never try to catch a falling knife. 
I know most people here say that's an impossibility, but thats what people said of the 400's not too long ago. The fact is that Bitcoin's value is at 7 billion, and that 3.5 billion could be the correct valuation the market is slowly headed to. There really is only 10,000 bitcoin loyalists using the coin regularly (complete guess), and 7 billion is a lot of money. This would be equivalent to a fortune 500 corporation. There's a lot of upside, but the market wouldn't be wrong in assessing its value at 1 billion or less since there is so much uncertainty.
I'd wait to see what the market does running up to the 15th too, because there could be a flash drop at some point where you can jump in. There is manipulation and many may use sometime during the run up to the China restrictions to cause more panic. The most important thing is to remember that time is on your side. Don't make a decision because youre afraid of losing out.

Who is the largest single holder of Bitcoin? Coinbase is probably a good guess. People feel more secure holding there coin there because its more guaranteed than other places. 
One day, when a company in a regulated area (like the US) can guarantee funds through insurance or size (nothing is ever completely guaranteed of course) the money will sit there. Soon it will be institutionalized like a normal bank.

If bitcoin becomes heavily adopted people will keep their bitcoins in a "Bitcoin Bank" and use a credit card, etc and have their funds secured and gauranteed.
The Bitcoin Bank will lend BTC to other businesses and act like a traditional bank.
So I agree it doesn't make too much sense. In what way will consumers be a bank? It seems like anyone can be a bank with cash-only transactions under this definition.

Is this the biggest heist in history? 782,000 * around 600 = 469 million

Well the crossing out "God" to right "math" is too much. Not because it could and will offend some people, but because its corny as hell and seems very egotistical.

I bought a car from someone and right before I paid with cash I asked if he would take bitcoin, and he thought about it for a few seconds before saying no.
But there was a hint of understanding there and I'm sure he went home and learned more about bitcoin.

Umm dude. In your Mom's perspective she probably doesn't think telling you is a major milestone. In her opinion she has made 35x her investment and doesn't know what the fuck your talking about murphy's law for.

Your list shows your bias. Be careful not to be too biased.
China accounts for 60% of trades so if China is able to stifle even half of that then the price will be going down further.
