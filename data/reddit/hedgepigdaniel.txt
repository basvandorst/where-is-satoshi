I don't think that works. The sender of the transaction can then change their mind at any time before the transaction gets into a block, and make the transaction invalid by removing the funds from the originating address wiht another transaction that gets into a block first.
So that means if you accept somebody's sell order, that somebody can still prevent the bitcoins from being delivered to your address (whereas you can't, because you have no way of making their transaction invalid). So you the buyer have to commit to the transaction before the seller does (and the seller could potentially spam the network to increase this delay). That isn't a fair exchange.

It's not a linear inflation model. coins are produced at a constant rate, but since the money supply grows that means inflation tends to zero over time.

The whole reason bitcoins are worth anything is because people think its useful as a currency. Otherwise why would people pour their money into buying them hoping people would buy these things that are otherwise not useful?
@_date: 2014-02-28 03:17:45
I am talking about price inflation. I think its more clear to talk about linear minting rate or linear increase in coin supply to express what I think you mean. Inflation is generally understood to be an overall increase in prices of goods denominated in a particular currency.

I think its more important for Bitcoin whether people who run Bitcoin businesses will be held accountable for anything that people who engage with their business might do (A la ISPs being held accountable for what their users download etc).
Governments will eventually make clearer rules about the monetary status of cryptocurrencies regardless of what the courts do.

Tangent: the use of the expression x-fold in the headline (and everywhere else) is confusing and stupid.
If you fold a piece of paper x times, its thickness increases by 2^x times. So a 10-fold increase should be an increase by a factor of 1024, not 10.

The motivation for taking a side doesn't prove anything about what is right.
Corrupt bankers steal from millions of people. Ross Ullbricht helped thousands to take drugs (which doesn't in itself harm anybody else) while reducing the violence and risk associated with getting them.
If it's true that he is a murderer then he doesn't seem like a hero anymore, but there is a good reason to think he didn't.
All your bullshit is a pathetic excuse for venting you're hatred of people who take drugs, as though you have a right to tell people how to live their lives.

If this is an intercity bus service then they probably have lots of international customers who would no doubt prefer to pay in Bitcoin and save large costs of exchanging their native currencies for Euros.
@_date: 2014-08-28 10:34:26
Yes thankyou, I can read.
In the meantime we are all free to speculate. My personal opinion is that the murder for hire charges were a stunt designed to prevent popular support for Ross Ullbricht. I will happily change my mind if new evidence appears, but in the meantime that is my opinion and I think it's reasonable.
The cops didn't do all that work and make all those self satisfied media releases to catch some murderer, they did it to make an example of someone who made a laughing stock of them and their efforts to stop drugs being sold.

Ok God, I give up. Instead of straw manning people, try actually engaging with the points they make. I'm not the ATO and I don't agree with this, so don't complain to me about it.
Your corporation, if it exists, is leaving Australia because of this and at the same time you don't give a fuck? Grow up.
@_date: 2014-08-28 02:55:52
No, but I expect evidence to be pretty clear for someone to be convicted of something so serious, and messages between anonymous people who may or may not exist discussing the murder of someone who has not been identified and may also not exist doesn't really cut it.
@_date: 2014-08-27 11:57:18
Fair enough, but it seems pretty clear that those charges were just a publicity stunt, otherwise they would still be pursuing the charges. Fancy convicting someone of murder without finding a body or identifying the victim...
@_date: 2014-08-21 02:05:12
The ATO collects tax in Australia. The ATO doesn't care what you think. If this is what they say they will do, this is what they will do, whether or not it is reasonable or clear. What they have just released is their interpretation of how current taxation laws apply to bitcoin.
I didn't say anything about wanting to feel "verified and safe", I said that a favorable tax environment for bitcoin (ie when arbitrary taxes aren't charged its use and it can be used as a currency without complication) will help the spread of bitcoin. Isn't that obvious? What does mainstream mean for you? You say you've been helping bitcoin spread but you never wanted mainstream adoption? Do you just want to be part of an exclusive club so you can feel important?
@_date: 2014-08-21 00:24:36
What I'm confused about is how exactly GST will be applied. In Australia GST is a value added tax, meaning that if a business sells a product for $1000 which was made from $900 worth of inputs, then it must pay 10% of the value it added to its inputs (i.e. 10% of $100). The businesses that made the $900 of inputs have to pay GST on their value added and so on.
So surely then since bitcoins are traceable, if an Australian business buys some bitcoins for $500 and sells them to an Australian person for $500, then they don't have to pay any GST?
Probably GST would apply to the full value if they were "imported" though...
@_date: 2014-08-21 00:04:22
Here is the full ruling by the ATO: 
@_date: 2014-08-21 00:59:51
Actually until yesterday the ATO had only released a few vague unofficial comments about Bitcoin; this is the first time they have released binding guidelines ( which is why it's in the news today Australian newspapers.
The ATO doesn't make law, it enforces it. This doesn't need to "become law", it is the ATO's interpretation of existing law which we can expect it to apply.
Very easy to say an entire country can go and fuck itself, harder to actually engage in a debate when the Australian tax system's treating of Bitcoin affects the spread of Bitcoin.

What difference do non mining full nodes make to this? A non mining full node has no more say than any other non mining node about what goes into blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:20:07
There have been blocks well over 1MB in BCH, and the fees did not skyrocket as they would have done with a 1MB block size limit
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:59:30
Seems like if you want to promote honest discussion, it would be better to have guidelines for what is on or off topic that are separate from what is right or wrong, or promoting/criticising. Truth should come out of discussion, not be mandated by those who happen to be in control.

Current top thread in (and if you've been watching for a few days you would remember the thread referred to): 
Also notice that the scores are hidden? I wonder how all these comments are sorted...
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:39:32
Wow, cool down...
There might equally be a bug in the implementation of segwit that triggers in some situation and causes a accidental hard fork. A simple change of a constant limit seems relatively unlikely to trigger such a thing. If that happens, maybe you can get back to me?
As for the fees... It doesn't really need to be tested to prove that a larger block limit causes lower fees, it's just simple supply and demand. A higher block size means more space for transactions and less need for out bidding. I can't tell you exactly what bch fees would be like if everybody switched to it but we can safely assume that it would be far lower than current fees on btc, since there is between 2x and 8x as much capacity, depending on segwit adoption (currently almost 0).
I not spamming anyone or colluding with any miners - perhaps we can stick to civil discussion instead of baseless accusations?
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:18:00
So you don't disagree with the truth of what he said... But somehow he's dishonest? Toxic?

The benefits of a higher block size on the other hand are immediate as we can now see
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:55:30
I see many posts from many other large large subreddits and its very rare that as many of them are hidden as they are here. Are the scores hidden until mods decide to show them (potentially only if they like what they see)?
When you say brigading - can you provide a specific link? The post I linked has a screenshot from pointing out that they were blocked after posting a comment (with 361 upvotes) making some light hearted fun of the censorship we're talking about here. I'm sure that's not the brigading you're talking about since that post was made ~after~ he was blocked from here.

I what way does ethereum have worse scalability than bitcoin? Recently it's been processing more transactions than bitcoin, and each transaction is typically more complex.

That's still expensive and slow compared to what it would be if the block size was bigger.

Sorry, people have been doing that for about 3 years and it's come to nothing. You're fooling yourself if you think the absence of a proposal has been the problem. The block limit is literally a single hard coded constant. Bitcoin Cash changed it and it's working great.

Umm.. A few of the people who have worked and are working on competing implementations/firms are actually former core developers!
The comparison is completely nonsensical anyway... How does forking an an open source project have anything to do with a sledgehammer or destroying things? The code is made available for free for anyone to use and modify, and some people do. Their fork should be evaluated on its merits.

The faulty assumption here is that this subreddit represents the Bitcoin project in some special way that doesn't. This subreddit is obviously strongly in favour of the Core fork of Bitcoin (partly due to the extensive... curation...), but there are other forks which are no less legitimate and which have strong community support, such as Bitcoin Cash.
Being a public blockchain, Bitcoin is not exclusively governed by any particular, group of developers, subreddit, or website.

To be fair, like 1% of users use Linux, and in any case on the arch Linux repositories bitcoin core is also still at 0.14.2. Can you even point me to a single distro where 0.15 is available? Why do you keep pursuing this ridiculous argument?
@_date: 2017-09-12 03:25:50
Perhaps, but the vast majority of Linux users also don't compile their own packages. Very very few of the users of bitcoin core compile it themself. Surely we can agree on this obvious fact?
I don't care who I'm talking to, but I don't take kindly too dishonesty, which is what it is to say that 0.15 is released when builds are not available to virtually all users.

It's an open source project... Every commit that is pushed is "released" if that's all it means...
All my posts are honest attempts to have a positive discussion. Sometimes that means calling it bad behaviour, such as telling lies.

Its not "out" until its on the download page, which currently is still at 0.14.2:
