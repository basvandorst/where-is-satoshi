I was wondering how I could but alts.  
I have BTC, LTC and ETH on Gdax atm.  I want to buy some alts on Kraken with one of the three above mentioned.  
  
Can I do this directly from GDax?  Or have to trasfer back to CB?  
Which would be cheapest to transfer? I prefer using the btc or ltc for alt purchases atm.

Interesting point you make there.  
IMO Belgium, in terms of wealth/economy, is pretty stable.  
Not that we trust our government completely, oh no sir, but in terms of economy I think we've been doing well or even great for a couple of years. No cases of hyperinflation.

People saying you have double now, do you mean you still have the Bcash from the fork. Or is there something i'm missing?

Anybody have an idea as to why Litecoin has risen so much? It's insane.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:20:56
In the past 2 weeks I must have heard 5-10  references to Bitcoin on Belgian radio.  
I noticed the discussion opened up between my friends too. These are mainly people almost done with college or just started working, fresh out of college.  
  
Knowledge is most certainly spreading. However lots of people are still sceptical.

I can't predict the future.  
If you are investing a small amount, let's say 100$ or €, it won't matter much. If BTW drops by 1000, your investment might be worth 10$ or € less.  
  
If you are planning on investing big it is more of a difference. With more risk comes more reward...or punishment.  
EDIt: What i'm trying to say is, it probably won't make a huge difference whether you started at 11k or 10K when not investing a big amount

Don't worry, it probably will.  
Lots of people, myself included, buy at an ATH. Every time it's high I wonder if I should buy more or 'wait for the dip'. Usually it doesn't matter that much.  This thing just rises again and the cycle starts all over.  
  
Ofcourse it is good that you are precautious. BTW has been doing well, but none of us really know what will happen in the future.

I have BTC, Eth and LtC at the moment but would like to get into other coins too.  
  
What do you guys think is the best exchange for alts? SO far I have been using Gdax which ofcoure only has 3 currencies.  
Kraken seemed interesting but it lacks IOTA.

CTRL +F this thread, He has basically posted 3 comments saying the same thing.  
Either trolling or somebody is really upset they are missing out / lost money.

If it crashes to 10K I would, personally, be a little bit afraid. That fear would be replaced in the next hour however with buying them sweet dips.

I'm already registered on Bitfinex. But it only seems to take BTC, huge amounts of EUR Or USD as currency?
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:30:05
Jut saw an [article by CNN] ( about Bitcoin MINE while scrolling.   
  
I have no idea what they are talking about...unless this is fake or they just talk about mining (no time to watch the video atm or go in detail)
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:34:28
THis was my first guess.  
New people are coming into crypto. Litecoin seems like the official cheap version of BTc....or something like that.  
So new people figure this is a worthy alternative...but CHEAPER!  
  
That is my gues, but still it's so much at once.

The 1 guy I discuss crypto with on a regular basis saw a dip of 1000-1500 euros and all the sudden he is warning me to get out.  
  
Dude, it was 5-10% . I'm just dissapointed I had no money in the exchange to buy with.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:17:10
I think it does. Works for EU so....
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:34:17
What about people investing now and expecting to be able to use it as an effective currency once things like transaction time is improved?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:15:36
Didn't know this yet, have been wanting to do this for a week of 2.

If you store magic internet money on a desktop wallet, ie. Electrum and that particular desktop or laptop crashes, do you lose everything on there? Or ist it more like an account which can be accessed on every pc?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:42:56
I got verified for Coinbase first, since they accepted 1 option.  
For GDax I needed 2. It took some tries to get a decent picture of the 2nd requirement, but in the end it got accepted.  
  
Are you trying to take pictures of your Id via Webcam or actually pictures? I found actual pictures to be easier.

THen I have no idea, maybe some digit or word isn't readable enough?  
Had the same problem several times, know how frustrating it is.
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:20:01
Sorry to tell you, but I bought BTC.  
Knowing my luck, It will crash next week and the whole world will go back to trading corn and wool.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:04:01
Probably a stupid question, but just to be sure. 
   
If I have to wait several days for my BTc when paying by Bank Transfer, will the BTW have the value of the moment I purchased them, or the moment they arrive?

Think I have seen this same photo in an article about some grower in the Netherlands. Not sure though.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:02:47
If this is a serious concern. I wouldn't be.  
It was bound to happen, the increase yesterday was huge. We could smell a correction from miles away.  
  
But look at the value now. Back at 10.3K at this exact moment.   
You aren't in the + yet, but give it some time.  
  
I am not a crypto vet by any means, but patience seems to be in my favor ever since.

Used coinbase th first time and did th Photo-ID verefication which worked. I am now trying to use GDAX but in order to do so I need a second verification.  
I can't use my drivers license (tried about 6 times) maybe because it is a EU drivers license?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:18:56
Check GDAX mostly, it hasn't hit 10k there just yet.  
Not that it matters, I'm eyeing them € anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:29:54
It just 'dipped'  to 10,7K. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:03:15
$11,2K now...
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:43:56
This is what I wanted to know, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:04:52
I just heard 'BTC hit $10K' on the radio.  
Not sure what exchange they are looking at, but atleast they are reporting it.  
Let's get this shit mainstream!
