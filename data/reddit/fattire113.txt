@_date: 2019-03-04 23:25:50
That has absolutely nothing to do with the Hodl mentality.  Another word for hodl is hoarding.  Hoarding a new currency kills the motivation for merchants to accept it as a form of payment.  
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:45:22
Now it’s hotels?  Your delusional life is getting more grandeur by the day!  Remember when you got caught trying to lie to me about you being rich a few weeks back.  Remember that it was proven that you still live at home and want to love out but can’t afford to?  Remember when you kept staring in other threads that hopefully you can get out of the working class if your investments finally come true?!?  Stop lying to people!  Nobody believes you or cares!

@_date: 2019-03-07 13:35:28
Or the hodlers (another name for hoarders) could actually use their currency and allow it to do what is intended.  Hodlers are the greed that is killing bitcoin.  Bitcoin can’t grow at a natural rate if everyone is refusing to spend their money.  No incentive for the merchants, and not enough liquidity (causing high volatility) in the market because of the hoarding.  But hey, maybe it will go to the moon so you guys can buy your lambos. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 13:42:21
By the way, this guy is a complete bullshitter.  He claimed to make all the amazing investments and was extremely rich to me a couple weeks back, but was on another thread talking about how he still lives at home and wants to move out.  Extremely pathetic, but hilarious the efforts he put in to try to convince a group (that couldn’t care less) that he was rich.

My main view is based on the fact that most crypto investors are hoarding their bitcoins until they are worth &gt;$20,000.  Since nobody is spending their coins, merchants have no incentive to accept the currency.  Without a major adoption of the currency across all merchants, the currency is useless.  Secondly, so many people got burned with the bubble bursting last year, that the general public is scared to get involved.  Also, merchants like consistency so they can easily budget and accurately project profit margins.  Crypto is too volatile to project earnings and formulate projections.  Additionally, banks don’t want to see the success of crypto, so they are working hard to destroy it.  Without major protectors/backers of the currency, it cannot work.  Lastly, I don’t see a reason for prices to go higher, yet.  When someone can give me good fundamental reasons the price should be higher, I will change my position.  I have a stop in place at $6,000 if I am wrong so I am guaranteed a decent profit.

Who are “they”?  If you are referring to people that are shorting bitcoin, then yes, but they don’t think it will.  Think of trading like gambling (anybody who says it isn’t is lying to themselves).  People that short the market are just betting that the market will go down instead of up.  They can make the same amount either way.  Best way to think about it is like this...  say you are in the market for a 1953 corvette and are willing to pay $100,000 for it (that means you would be willing to long the corvette at $100,00) and you want it delivered at noon March 31st (this would be the futures contract).  I believe I can find the corvette that you want for cheaper than $100,000 before march31st, so I agree to sell you the corvette.  I thus entered into a short contract with you.  Meaning that I need to buy the corvette at some point and hope that I can find it cheaper than $100,000.  In terms of crypto, the shorts like myself don’t believe that crypto will be bullish anytime soon, so we made bets that it will remain low for some time.  I am definitely willing to long it, but don’t see a reason too yet.  All money trying to push crypto higher is just a drop in the bucket compared to the financial backing of the banks trying to make sure it fails.  When that changes, I will be willing to long it.  Not sure if I answered your question at all, but I hope I did.

@_date: 2019-02-25 19:13:15
Both can be converted to USD so you can arb the difference of prices between the two.  Example:  buy current BTC at 3853.15, sell futures at 3950.  Since both can be settled in usd or other currency, they have a common denominator and a profit can immediately be locked in.  This is called arbitrage opportunity.  Because of this, the spread between futures and current prices remains close.  Many Crypto traders are too emotionally invested in their product that they don’t see the big picture or bother doing research on how real trading works.  Another reason why most crypto traders have negative P/L for the past 12 months.

@_date: 2019-01-19 22:40:25
Just another bandaid...  Processing is done end of day.  We have seen bitcoin easily move 10% in a day.  Still way too risky for the typical merchant.  Additionally, there is a 1% fee on top of that risk.  Demand for use isn’t high enough for merchants to justify risk because everyone is Hodling their position.  
@_date: 2019-01-19 03:48:12

Nope.  
Worth is a term used to denote how much something will cost or how much an item will sell for. For example, your house might be worth $100,000 on the real estate market, or your flat screen TV might sell for $500 at auction. The monetary value attached to any particular item is an item's worth.
Value is a broad term that encompasses emotion as well as cost. For example, while that old, chipped vase handed down to you by your aunt might only be worth $10, to you it might be invaluable and therefore has low worth but high value. Value can also be used to describe items that don't necessarily have a dollar value attached to them, like the value of being part of a decentralized currency.

Ultimately, Crypto traders have no idea what they are up against with the futures game.  It is a variable that many are too novice to understand the true impact.  Here is an interesting article on it.  It argues some of your points.  
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:19:22
You are correct with you assumption and have touched on a much larger play that is currently happening.  The question is, what will happen when the larger centralized exchanges create more value than the ones they represent?  Similar to when the dollar was backed back gold.  
Also, kudos to you for analytically looking at the large picture.  Many people in the crypto world are so blinded by beliefs that they don’t see the danger of investments.  
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:39:32
I agree to an extent, but there are several reasons why people are trading bitcoin futures.  One main reason, is the trades are insured by the exchange (for CME).  This helps ease tensions for larger investors that want it part of their portfolio, but don’t want to deal with the intricacies of the smaller market places.  Additionally, CTAs (futures version of hedge funds) are regulated by the NFA and must solely trade futures for their investors.  Bitcoin futures has allowed these funds to enter the crypto world, which can be a hit marketing piece right now.  As for the price action, a lot of uncertainty, so I will just keep dipping my toe in it until it becomes more secure and transparent.  
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:08:00
Being a futures trader for 15+ years for various funds, and currently trading CME bitcoin futures (along with several other markets), I can assure you that bitcoin futures prices don’t move independently, because this creates short term arb opportunities and traders are quick to lock in the trade.  As for HFT trading in crypto, trust me it’s there.  That being said, I am very much against the 20/1 leverage.  The only reason you would need a leverage that large is if you are going all or nothing and don’t have the bankroll to support the investment.  WCGW.

I agree that the people that believe in its ability aren’t using their holdings to better the longevity of the currency (if you want to call it that).  Instead they are Hodling or hoarding it, which goes against its principle cause.  
@_date: 2019-01-19 19:54:04
You are correct to an extent.  The problem is,nobody wants to spend their Bitcoins in a bull market so the market dries up on the consumer side.  Either way, it is too volatile to use as a method of payment for general merchandise.  
@_date: 2019-01-19 17:21:37
One of the main systematic problems with bitcoin is that the price is too volatile for merchants to accept as a payment.  If a margin of a good is only 10% and bitcoin has &gt;20% weekly swings, the risk of loss is too great to accept as a payment.  Especially when it is a small minority that want to use it as a payment.  
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:01:35
Will it?
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:05:03
Which in turn gives no incentive for merchants to accept it because the supply is so low, killing the idea of it as a currency.   Which will obviously keep the pricing down. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 17:16:09

@_date: 2019-01-07 18:39:43
While you are correct about the cash settled product and it’s direct effect on the supply/demand of the underlying product, I believe your view may be a little short sided.  The main reason for it, is every short doesn’t impact the supply/demand of a product.  The act of short selling the market is when an investor/trader “borrows” a security, sells it on the open market, and buys it back at a later price.  This ultimately has no direct impact on supply/demand because they borrowed the product.  If they didn’t borrow the product and try to buy it back, it would simply be called selling.  Additionally, derivatives have a major impact on the underlying product they represent.  A perfect example is the flash crash on May 6, 2010, which originated from the CME E-mini S&amp;P500 contract (a cash settled product), but dragged the price of the individual stocks with it.  
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:55:16
It doesn’t eliminate the problem for the merchants because the intraday volatility is too great for a merchant to be marked to end of day price.  As for the other issues, there has always been global economic pressure among currencies.  Brexit is a tiny issue compared to some of the global crises we’ve experienced in the past.  I’m not holding my breath that it will catch on, that is why I’m still rolling my shorts from $12,500.  I will switch my position when someone can give substantial evidence why bitcoin should be valued higher than $1,500.  
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:10:27
The general consensus is that it was a bubble.  Everyone that invested in it because it was the hot investment product and had no emotional attachment is out and we are only left with the people who assign an emotional value higher than its worth.
