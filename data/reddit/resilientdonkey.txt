Detailed instructions follow:  
1. Buy $100K worth of Bitcoin  
2. Transfer immediately to a paper wallet  
3. Wait for a couple of days for the price to drop  
4. There you go, you now own $50K worth of Bitcoin!  
5. Profit!

With a carefully selected list of "fundamentals" you can prove that the Grumpy Cat is better than peanut butter and vice versa. 
Good thing you omitted "transaction speed" and "price stability"  or people might have thought there is something wrong with Bitcoin. To da moon!!

And it's not only about regulations. If they allow bitcoin deposit/withdrawal, that opens a whole new can of worms when it comes to collusion and cheating. One person creating few accounts and funding with them with bitcoin is much easier than doing the same with credit cards. My guess is they may allow bitcoin deposits but will require withdrawals to be made via wire or some other method where it's easier to identify who is at the other end of the transactions.

High or not, I'd be perfectly happy with 10% finders fee for any newly "discovered" bitcoins. What I'm not happy about is the fact they are not putting any of their own money. Just the opposite - they want to take $10M from our money.

WTF? Anarchystar said the other day that he only has $400K left on gox. He had over 10K BTC but sold most of it on bitcoinbuilder. So what 5M debt is he talking about?

Predictions are like asses, everybody has one. When he's willing to bet serious money on his "predictions", I'd be intrigued.
I predict that this year at least one newborn child will be named Humperdungelfritz.

I'm not saying volatility is a secret. I'm saying he deliberately omitted it as if the only "fundamentals" that matter are the positive ones. With this "scientific" approach it's very easy to prove 1 BTC will be = 1000 gold bars in a month.

That's surely one of the reasons. The other could be that the proposal is simply nonsense. So, instead of buying bitcoin on localbtc, I'll buy nubits on localnb, which I can then use on a decentralized exchange to buy btc. Genius at work! Decentralization solved!

Japanese law says all assets are sold and the cash is then distributed.

No, it's more like if after 9/11 the WH sent out a press release "Look, the background of wh.gov is now black! That's much better, isn't it?"

This would be epic. Reminds me of "The usual suspects". The dimwit turns out to be a mastermind with infinite IQ :)

No, it doesn't. Not until there is a cryptocurrency that is actually a USD equivalent. Until then you're just replacing one kind of friction with another. Sure, you can hold $1M worth of nubits on an exchange but how do you buy in in a decentralized way? How do you cash out? 
Other than that, I admit nubit seems very interesting but I'm skeptical the peg will last. Eventually there will be a Soros-vs-Bank of England type of event.

Umm..no. That damage figure of $900/btc is so off the mark, you couldn't have possibly gotten it from MtGoxLegal. BTC claimants get 0% damages. Fiat claimants get about 26% damages.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:02:01
You did notice the $900 is for 10 coins, right? And even $90/coin is wrong. Argue with the trustee:

MtgoxLegal is an entity for crowdfunding legal help in order to facilitate the transition from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation, which, in turn, will give creditors the chance to get more money out of the whole ordeal. If you're not a creditor and you don't have an accepted claim then there is simply no point for you to donate. 
And yes, gox's trustee knows how much every person is owed but this doesn't have anything to do with MtgoxLegal

Why did you make a new rainbow chart? Are you saying the old rainbow charts couldn't predict the future and were totally useless? That's shocking! I'm glad you finally got it right though.
