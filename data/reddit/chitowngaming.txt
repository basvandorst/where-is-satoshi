Jesus lord.  Bitcoin will replace your need to breathe next...

I agree with you, but a lot of companies that operate within the U.S. just simply move their "headquarters" overseas to escape paying taxes to the very country they made their fortunes in, so I have no problem with the anger and frustration being expressed in this subreddit.  That is one of the great things about reddit.  
With that said, if bitcoin is to be taken seriously simply ignoring the ruling will not move us towards that goal.  I would opt for the petition option first and work from there.

What a crazy day...I have to get some sleep I'll see what goes on tomorrow.  I'm really sorry for people who put in money that they can't stand to lose.  Let's all hope for a rally.

Thank god I read this post.  I am thinking of selling some of my bitcoins.  I have them in a private wallet.  What exchange would you recommend people using to sell their bitcoins?

So should I send you 10 first as a test, then the other 20?  
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:02:44
Yes I am.

Yea...this needs verification...sounds too good to be true.

I've been reading through the discussion but had to cut it a bit short.  It seems like the site has had little to no effort put into it but there were people saying they used the service and it worked.  On the other hand, some people were saying the people were part of one group trying to lure people in.  Did they ever get to a conclusion of whether this is a legitimate service or not?

I will keep this in mind, yes I am from Chicago.  I work downtown but let me talk to my friend, who is half shareholder of our little enterprise, and see if and when he would want to sell.

How do I sell bitcoins?

When are people going to realize the majority of the public are either too stupid to understand, or too busy watching Franklin and Bash to give a shit?  They cannot be bothered unless you take away their cable, then they call 9-11.
