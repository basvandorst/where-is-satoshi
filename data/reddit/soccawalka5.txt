Yeah exactly. I think I am just so used to having control over my own password that it is hard to let someone else generate a "password" for me. The reality is, we aren't great at creating our own passwords as is :)
I am all about crypto, I just think that if I am concerned about this (someone that is relatively tech-savvy, moderately intelligent, fairly willing to put my trust in someone else), then there is still some work to do to properly communicate the security of the private keys to others. I imagine lots is being done though, I just haven't spent much time reviewing.

Cool, will review later. Thanks!

Hey there. Apologies if I am missing something, but I was being serious. Thanks for any clarification!
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:30:32
Haha, fair enough. I guess I just can't fathom odds that great! Starting to understand now. Thanks!

I wasn't clear in my comment - I meant having a 24 word key as well as one last 4 digit PIN that I get to pick. I now am understanding why just having the 24 word key is sufficient.

I see. I guess I wish there was one extra layer of security for my peace-of-mind. So that way someone would have to know both the 24 word key that is created for me, as well as having a 4 digit PIN that I create. It would be great marketing for bitcoin if someone were to quantify the odds in a relatable way.

Great analogy, thank you!

Hey there, would love to clarify my comment. I was implying that there is a peace-of-mind that would come with having both the 24 word key as well as one last 4 digit PIN that I could create. It was more of a commentary into feeling like I have some part of my security that I can control (versus just having a key that is given to me). I totally see the security of having just the 24 word key now.

Is there any monetary gain in doing this?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:00:58
I finally get it. Thank you!!

So let's say I have 1 BTC worth $15k. I then get 2 BTC, totaling to $30k?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:19:38
Wow, okay that makes more sense. Are you suggesting that there are 2048 possible words?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:36:28
What is the "cut" you're referring to? Sorry still learning.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:38:10
Love it! Thanks for sharing.
