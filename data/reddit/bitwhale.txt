That's not how any of this works. Nodes can invalidate all they want. An attack using hash rate still works just fine to cripple Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 19:44:54
No. This has been the case and is the case as long as miners agree with the consensus of the users. That's not even close to a given. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:51:41
See, there is a reasonable argument. None of that 'they are evil' or 'Roger Ver wants to destroy bitcoin' BS.
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:17:14
By the same logic that we can be fairly certain that anyone that held $200+ million USD a few months ago probably is good for $500k a few months later.
I'm fine with the semantic discussion, but it's simply stupid and juvenile to question it especially considering Ver, outside of holding Bitcoin conventionally also owns minority positions in over 20 successful bitcoin ventures. 
Example: I would argue that it's 'fairly certain' that you are not a hamster, since an overwhelming majority of hamsters to my knowledge do not have internet access, or the ability to articulate themselves using a keyboard. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:16:37
He may not be 'technically wrong' depending on how he defines 'Bitcoin'. But the idea that the anything that isn't the best technical solution is doomed to be a low value altcoin simply isn't how market economics work. Technical proficiency or elegant solutions does in NO way guarantee market acceptance. 
There is no guaranteed correlation between what developers or even members of this community value, and what the market values.

That might be the reason why I didn't describe it as 'I am certain' or 'I have proof'. It's estimated that he at one point held in the ballpark of 300,000 BTC and for the sake of argument I think we can be fairly damn certain he holds over 500 BTC which was the point of the thread so..

I'm not anti SegWit at all. It's not my fault that you are unable to follow my argument on how the market works without assigning it values it doesn't have.

It definitely can. But if mining is profitable, what's the natural mechanism for decentralizing the network? Cause it sure isn't messing with consensus or threatening the people that invest in mining. 
I would argue that it is for holders to out their money where their coin is and start mining.

@_date: 2017-03-22 17:13:10
This is possible. But we can't forget that SegWit is also an unknown as of now. Nothing would directly stop LN operators from essentially starve out miners by offering a faster service with occasional chain anchors that result is minimal mining fees, essentially controlling the fate of miners. 
Not saying it's likely, but it's not impossible. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:28:17
Oh dear. I don't care what problem people have with him. That's entirely beside the point. 
The entire beauty of the Bitcoin blockchain is that celebrities don't matter. 
It's an entirely binary system where we can disregard what people say and just act. 
If Ver manages to sway the community into taking action that's a different story, but the blockchain isn't something where your opinion counts unless you actually have hardware, tokens etc. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:13:32
Sure, they CAN. But where is the motivation to destroy anything at all? Outside of wild conspiracy theories that 'Communist China' wants to kill bitcoin, why would miners kill the golden goose?

The community is already 'united' in that they want block size increase outside of SegWit. The split isn't about this, the split is about BU or CORE.

@_date: 2017-03-22 17:33:02
You can argue that. But you could also argue that it's a completely natural side effect of economic climate, risk acceptance and adoption. Just 2-3 years ago 80%+ of all mining was done in the U.S. and that didn't seem to worry people. 
I also haven't seen any miners so far act against Bitcoin in a substantial or prolonged manner (greed wise yes, destructive no).

Agreed. A little simplified and brutal but all in all I'd say it's pretty accurate. Possibly with the exception that in 'blockchain land' it's almost impossible to determine what future results in 'worse world to live in' in this case, since we simply can't predict it.

@_date: 2017-03-29 16:07:25
If that is true for bitcoin, you could argue that it was a grand experiment that failed. 
If the factors that have taken bitcoin this far still rule, a fork should simply lead to momentary uncertainty as miners and nodes 'pick side' and shortly after a clear winner based on the factors that govern the network (Economic incentive, hash rate, node count, utility etc.). 
Personally I think that the Bitcoin network's future outlook would be strengthened significantly having weathered a possibly somewhat contentious hard fork since it would prove once more than the blockchain is bigger than the sum of its parts and can survive what many consider adverse events. 
I'm not saying I support CORE or BU. I am speaking purely philosophically about the Bitcoin blockchain and it's future here. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:28:59
1. It wouldn't be a couple of weeks, 11 day diff reset at 40 min block time could easily mean a month and a half. 
2. Difficulty reset max doesn't fix the problem, it just drops block time by 30%
3. If more miners leave (which they would if value crashes) it could indefinitely extend the delay, and cause block times to skyrocket to the point where next diff reset becomes a virtual eternity
4. How do you expect implement SegWit on a chain that doesn't propagate at pace and is open to attack over and over again?
This isn't a 'we will just fix it' problem. It could easily mean the death of the chain that miners leave. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:57:51

It's slowing my mind that all these 'Bitcoin celebrities' think their statements matter. Do they really think that the blockchain gives a shit about what they say?

@_date: 2017-03-29 15:59:07
Comparing bitcoin to a p2p network in my opinion isn't useful. Personally I don't worry about a fork for 2 seconds since it's a natural event and it also splits all pre-fork tokens so as long as at least one fork survives it's a natural voting mechanism. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:16:10
Absolutely, I am not arguing that it's a good thing by any means. Just that economic value isn't tied to technological factors by default. It's entirely likely that 'BU Coin' would become what the public and investors know at 'Bitcoin' and carries far more value than any other 'bitcoin'.

I didn't say that they have failed to deliver it at all. I'm just pointing out that whether or not they are right that compromising with big block supporters is "technically" a bad idea the market doesn't care and the uncertainty is causing Bitcoin to lose momentum and value. 
This is often what happens when technologists drive development detached from the market forces.

Why is Bitcoin great? Cause it gives zero shits about easily manipulated online polls, celebrity opinions &amp; industry letters and listens to hash rate, nodes, ownership, and signaling.

But that makes zero sense. If you didn't represent Core, and had no intent of merging or deploying any code, what in the world was "agreed" on and by who?
@_date: 2017-03-30 22:57:58
If you think that capital heavy multi currency miners are somehow in a subservient position to exchanges you will be in for a serious reality check. 
Exchanges list, trade and support the longest stable chain. Not the other way around.
This is why 'industry letters' are worthless.
What do you think is harder to "turn on". A few exchanges or $500 million in hardware?
I can guarantee that if BU forks and retains a valid chain of 90% hash rate exchanges will switch loyalty faster than you can say "Corecoin". 
And I am not even taking sides. I just think the reality of market economics wins over pretty code and forum whining every day. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:32:23
Easy. I wouldn't. You can't work with complete unknowns. It's as likely that the node count drops, as it is that a larger block size would bring in more nodes due to an increase in price or visibility. Since we haven't had a block size increase (not really) in the history of Bitcoin as a value transfers medium there is simply no comparative data to work with outside of pure speculation. This makes all "predictions" nothing but wild guesses. 
Sure you can probably make some assumptions based on node-data consumption and geographical position of IP based on median internet access speed and connection type etc. But not to any useful extent since it's not a consistent variable.

That is an incorrect statement since it doesn't take into account peak block activity. You can't make statements assuming low/median activity or scenarios. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:08:50
I agree. I just can't agree with the 100% statement since it is false by definition. 
I also don't think miners alone can effectively create a "new Bitcoin" but I think we can all agree that a hard fork in itself as a function doesn't mean that the winning chain becomes an altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:17:37
I can agree to that. And I still don't see a clear consensus among the involved players.

But somehow validating or mining blocks that signals BU is right? 
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:44:27
I would have to disagree quite forcefully. Hard forking is a natural mechanism for development of bitcoin, and 100% consensus is by nature an impossible requirement. Or are you arguing that bitcoin should simply never be able to upgrade outside of soft forks?
I feel there is a huge disparity between what people see as 'bitcoin' and an 'altcoin' and in my view (and I believe the intent of Satoshi) is that the longest valid chain is Bitcoin. Something that can be achieved with far less than 100% consensus. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:02:05
You have an exceptionally ego centric view of what Bitcoin is. Trust me, you don't "employ" anyone as long as there is a block subsidy that averages 20x total transaction fees per block.

Boldly bad argument. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:51:15
And there is nothing anyone can 'do' about that since exchanges operating in their own self interest will support and list whatever coin has value and a trading interest. Any exchange claiming not to is lying.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:22:07
$1300-$970 and altcoin market cap up 85% in a month is plenty worried in my book.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:11:58
I'm suggesting that node owners will switch to BU if it's the chain with the majority hash rate because that's the only chain where they can realize value. 
You can have all the nodes you want verifying transactions but if that chain has 40 min block times and is open to attack it will die off.
It has nothing to do with what chain is "technically superior" it has to do with which one is a functional value carrier. 
The market cares far less about decentralization and technical factors than the developers do. 
BetaMax was technically superior to VHS, and we know how that went. Erherum was "doomed" after the hard fork and is currently at all time high. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:34:07

Absolutely, and I realize the vocal minority of core is just that. I'm just saying that from time to time both camps act like children. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:16:25
If you are gonna just list scary and strange ideas by developers maybe include some from the Core side of things: 
* 128k block size for decentralization purposes (Luke Jr)
* Censoring gambling addresses in the client (Luke Jr)
Those are two that come to mind without any research.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:09:30
Oh snap kid. Did you wake up with all that sand in your vagina or did you have to spoon it in during breakfast?
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:06:28
Not at all. If it splits and a clear majority of hash rate chooses a chain, the other chain will be virtually non functional no matter.
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:12:53
So because someone's opinion differ from yours let's spend all day posting shit cartoons about them instead of doing anything useful. 
Yeah, my point stands pretty solid.
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:21:53
Wait, what is? 
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:33:20
I will admit that its possible that they are somewhat muddled. The way I have always understood it is that you can't really replace signaling consensus with UASF, and I can't shake the feeling that UASF is now being touted as a "solution" mostly because core supporters have realized that the 95% activation threshold simply won't be reached. It just doesn't quite smell right. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:01:43
If you think so you don't understand market economics. If you need examples of "technically advantageous" products losing to the market I bet someone has a BetaMax tape, or Laserdisc to show you a video about the devastating hard fork that forever destroyed all the value of Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:09:54
Gotcha. Just thinking that if it's possible, it would be a great opportunity for someone to 'build it" and showcase its use as a way to in a very tangible way demonstrates why SegWit is a good idea. 
I think LN to a lot of people is a "sounds great" idea, but it's always hard to grasp solutions on a philosophical or technical level without hands on experience. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:09:48
Absolutely not. It's how it's supposed to work. All I am pointing out is that it's not always just printing money with not a care in the world. Like some people seem to describe it. It's an actual investment with actual risk..
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:47:01
LukeJr, you are a brilliant programmer but you always fail to take market economics into consideration. If enough value is destroyed, users will move to the longest chain supported by ASIC and validate that chain to save their money.
It's not a technical battle, it's a value battle and the market doesn't care about what's the "most technically proficient" or even most effective solution. It cares about what solution provides the best value.
If BU has the hash power to propagate the network with the longest chain, and attack the core chain nodes will move to verifying whatever chain allows users to retain value. 
See. VHS/BetaMax and the "Death of Ethereum".

Bullshit analogy again of course but you do you.
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:57:33

@_date: 2017-03-25 08:32:41
I agree. I know several developers that contribute to core and (and this is not an insult) none of them have a real passion for or are even remotely interested in the "right now usability". 
Financial history or econ is great. But the current financial fringe where we and crypto live doesn't play by those rules. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:34:55
Yeah. Just make 600 petahash of "scabs" happen. Seriously, are there people this stupid that consider themselves informed enough to have an opinion? Do you have any grasp of what happens to the utility of the Bitcoin blockchain if 80% of miners fork it and you try to keep the low hashrate chain alive?
@_date: 2017-03-25 00:36:00
Possible. But there are no dual camps in Litecoin, and the need for upgrades won't be as pressing with shorter block times (and if we can get SegWit active on LTC that's huge) and with mimblewimble = slamdunk
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:19:16
Well yeah, and when the market worries you step out of Bitcoin and buy back when it's not anymore.

@_date: 2017-03-24 20:56:50
I think (personally) that people are MORE worried outside the echo-chamber that is There is a very real possibility of a fork at pretty much any time.
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:11:32
No it wouldn't have. Cause core were idiots putting activation threshold at 95%
@_date: 2016-03-23 18:45:01
1. No it's not. 2. Taking a year to decide what to do about full blocks is sheer incompetence. I'm fine in other crypto.
@_date: 2017-03-29 02:20:41
And the obvious problem with that being that not a single miner will ever believe that core will ever push hard fork code after the 'Hong along Accord's debacle and LukeJr being of the opinion that we should lower block size and not increase it. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:34:31
I would disagree. Yes nodes are important but so are miners. Neither can do their job without the other. 
That's what blows my mind about this "debate". Bitcoin needs economics, nodes and miners to function and ward off possible attacks. 
You could easily argue that nodes are less important since the "cost" of setting up and funding 1000 nodes is far lower than spinning up 10% of the network hash rate in ASIC. 
If Ver wanted to really disrupt. He could easily manufacture consensus by controlling a majority of nodes and fund them with a split of say 150,000 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:46:43

@_date: 2017-03-22 15:55:34
I think you may also be vastly overestimating the extent to which the 'community' cares about what bitcoin is, vs. what it represents. 
In a fork, its entirely possible that the chain that carries economic value will emerge as 'Bitcoin' and the market doesn't care about community, principles, etc. 
Pretending that there is a 'true bitcoin' and an 'altcoin' in the face of usability and value will simply not work.
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:06:13
"but sooner or later its centralization will destroy it" there is zero evidence to support this 'inevitability' but it's entirely possible. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:02:49
Is that a serious question? We are down 10% since BU started threatening a fork and you don't think value will be destroyed if it actually happens?
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:35:42
Sure. I just haven't personally talkes to anyone that have mentioned any pressure independently of volume. If you require financing or some form of joint partnership etc. It's entirely possible I guess. 
That said. I haven't personally seen evidence of it. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:04:48
A realistic calculation based on knowing some people and being able to hire at least 2 lead engineers with ASIC/Bitcoin experience would probably be around $6-8 million from inception to first run on the finished chip.
Assuming 16/14nm with a high end fab.
That means you need about $2 million to go from scratch to a team and enough work in a chip design done to be able to go for capital to make an actual miner. 
It's not impossible but it's not cheap.

The problem isn't that they are bad at communicating, it's that they communicate the wrong thing.

My "Gut" tells me that initial reaction to drastically increased block size would lead to an at least initially drop. 
That said, outside of that I can't even speculate since we don't have any data what so ever to base any extrapolation on. 
This makes it impossible in my opinion. It could lead to a sustained drop. It could also spur new node owners due to visibility and network effect and we could see an increase. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 14:31:30

No one is arguing it doesn't. (No one with half a brain at least). The entire argument is whether or not softfork to SegWit is the way to go, or hard fork to larger block and segwit.

Both sides of the Isle have behaved shady for quite some time. And while the current BU code is far from prime time ready I disagree that this alone would amount to big-block proponents being out to destroy Bitcoin or evil in any respect. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:42:10
Absolutely. One could of course argue that we could work with only the parameters given and extrapolate those, which would almost certainly show a decrease in nodes. 
The problem with that is the same as asking only one legged people what they think of shoes being sold in pairs.

"I think it's safe to say" = I can't prove it, but I'll be damned if that stops me from claiming it's fact. 
How is this an argument in a binary environment?
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:07:33
Semantics if 80% of hash rate moves since the minority chain will lose all utility with 4x block times. The network effect would also drop even more hash power off that chain and almost ensure death. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:02:57
But how many (serious question) of them signal for SrgWit? Is there a difference between enabled and signaling for? And should we list non-listening nodes? Sorry I am by no means an export on nodes.

Ha ha. OK child. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:02:55
I definitely see what you mean. But you could also argue that whatever a majority hash-power and node count does to the network is objectively how the network is intended to work since the only rule of law in blockchain tech is just that. 
The fact that a vocal majority of forum users, redditors or celebrities may not agree does nothing to change how the blockchain works and the parameters that control it. It's a binary system.

Agreed, but I felt it was needed to point out that mining isn't always just a no-risk venture where you just sit back and make money. 
Plenty of large mining operations started at the wrong time has lost millions of dollars and beeen forced to close. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:10:41
Absolute idiot argument since hash power and price are intricately intertwined and there is essentially zero chance that a minority chain would carry a value that trends the same way as a majority chain. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:13:59
Agreed. But a "live implementation" would draw a LOT more attention and testing, as well as on-board users that would become evangelists for SegWit. 
But that's probably just the marketer in me taking. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:46:33
I'm hoping for an amicable solution that leads to a non contested hardfork with dynamic block size + SegWit. 
That said I'll be buying BU at current prices since I think there is a better than 20% statistical possibility that the chain splits a s BU Coin holds value over CORE coin. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:45:08
There are no "hard facts" here. And there is no"why don't they understand that this is just how it is". 
Yes, I agree. On-chain only scaling is not the solution. But I also don't buy the argument that it's an evil that has to be fought. 
I'm certain that node decentralization would survive 2 or even 4 MB on-chain scaling just fine, leaving plenty of space for on-chain transaction room for high value transfers while SegWit enables LN solutions for the day to day payments. 
I have heard very few miners argue that on-chain ONLY is an optimal solution. They just feel villified and ignored by core and the primarily U.S. community. 
They also feel that it's "a little" strange that mining centralization was fine when the U.S. miners had 90% of the network hash, but all.of a sudden a huge concern when it happens to reside in Asia. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:50:17

I'll concede that it may not be technically or structurally wrong.

There is no "one individual in China". And the chain that is attack resistant and carries utility will hold value over any other, whether it's 'controlled' by Chinese, U.S., Europeans or Martians.

On the flip side you could ask: What happens to mining if a post SegWit adoption mean that LN operators simply starve out miners by not paying enough transaction fees?

@_date: 2017-03-24 21:11:47
Ah, true I did get a little turned around. Still, I would argue that it looks like the concern is deepening if you look at altcoin volume and price development. I would expect BTC price to drop under the current floor of $940 and hit the $800s soon if nothing is resolved.

That's entirely possible. Though I am far less worried about a contentious hard fork than UASF. I just personally feel that UASF is somewhat of a way to circumvent how Bitcoin was intended to work, while a hardfork as scary as it can seem is a direct function of the design. 
I could be wrong but that's my gut so far. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:40:07
Yes there are. But between the people that want SegWit and the people who will accept SegWit if it comes with a hard fork to larger block size a majority would be far easier reached than the current two camp. 
See. Difference between "All" and "Majority". 
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:21:59
Agreed, but doesn't this also mean that if a majority fork happens that increases block size, this implementation would be possibly locked into a minority fork?
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:55:34
Damn, I am so concerned what a petulant child like yourself thinks what can I do to change your mind? :)
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:41:55
Hash power goes where there is value to be realized. Not simply value. There is a clear diminishing return to hold value that can't easily be realized in a timely manner.
There is also a percentage of perceived value that miners are willing to be elastic with depending on trends and market direction so it's not a 1:1.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:35:30

@_date: 2017-03-23 12:41:49
There are lots of opinions on what went down, but I don't think there is any getting away from.the fact that both core and BU (to blanket organize them) has behaved very immaturely throughout the "debate". 
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:16:42
But in all fairness, isn't this also a step away from the original governing principles of Bitcoin and a fairly heavy handed mechanism to curb non-core implementations? 
Isn't it somewhat dangerous to start walking off things like larger blocks etc. In what is essentially the reference installation of blockchain software?
Or am I misunderstanding the intent?

@_date: 2017-03-22 18:37:14
I can see the concern. But I also feel that with the clear majority of Bitcoin holdings residing with 10-20 primarily U.S whales, I would argue that it's sort of pathetic of them to sit on $100s of millions, unwilling to invest it and still demand that those who have invested vast sums into mining just dance to their tune. 
Important to remember that for over a year mining was a very low margin or even losing proposition as Bitcoin hovered around $200-$450. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 03:31:59
Yes. Everyone that doesn't share in the mass hysteria over the core / BU shit flinging is a shill. We know. 
And no. You don't provide "proof from the horse's mouth" or anything close to it. Yoi posted a link to a comment where someone claimed that they "want peoppe to support BU" I have bought plenty of Bitmain miners with no request to run any specific signaling at all. 
I also see you missed the "one manufacturer" so I assume you are a paid shill astroturfing for Core.
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:04:40
The fact that you think so is evidence that you don't understand how the market works. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:06:57
I disagree. Core has had many many critical bugs throughout the years that were patched. But also hasn't attempted a chain split yet. Doing so with current client would indeed be risky and possibly negligent, but that doesn't mean Ver doesn't have what he believes to be the best for Bitcoin at heart. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:07:42

@_date: 2017-03-24 15:10:12
I can somewhat agree with that. Though Bitmain selling to Chinese miners first doesn't mean he is 'preferential', it's just good business. Why deal with 10,000 US customers if you can sell the same amount to 3 customers in your own backyard? I would take 5 x $100 million customers over 50,000 x $10,000 customers every day of the week.

@_date: 2017-04-10 17:53:57
No it won't be. It's entire pointless since it doesn't rely on the same code structure, doesn't have decentralized ownership, and doesn't have the hash power required for a stable coin. 
You might as well just bolt SegWit onto a bucket of popcorn.
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:30:20
I am not arguing outcome. I am arguing cause and effect. And the cause here was a theft of funds under the control of a business entity, and the effect was a loss for the company's customers. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:27:49
I find it impossible that you cannot understand that "fully reimbursed" doesn't mean "if you held some high risk tokens for months on end on an exchange that had just lost $100 million". 
It's nothing but complete bullshit. 
They didn't "take responsibility" they forced the risk onto their customers and crossed their fingers and hoped that future trading profits would eventually cover the loss. 
Fully reimbursed would mean ALL customers are.made whole. That will never happen. 
But most of all I find it exceptionally distasteful that Bitfinex seems to think that the fact that the customers that held their high risk IOU made their money back is a PR opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 15:10:32

@_date: 2017-04-13 18:45:12
Very much so. We are already seeing primarily Dash/Litecoin/ETH competing with Bitcoin, and if volume for those altcoins stay high Bitcoin could easily lose the lead as value transfer protocol. 
The main reason for Bitcoin being the de-facto value protocol in crypto is the high volume and relatively stable price. 
If alts catch up on this factors Bitcoin gets real competition. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:24:59
How is it inaccurate? Did customers after the hack have the option of withdrawing ALL their funds? Was the hack NOT preventable by a correct implementation of cold storage? 
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:35:04
I agree that raw hash-rate in itself has very small effect. My point is just that the power efficiency ASICBOOST affords miners actually carry less weight in China/Russia than almost anywhere else since their power price is their main competitive advantage already. 
20% power savings in the EU/UK/US are 'worth' more than in China due to a higher average KW/h price.

Grammatically sure. But what possible difference does it make if you "segregate" customer funds from each other when you haven't secured them? And if an attacker can empty customer accounts on a large scale, how are those funds practically segregated?

As much as that is possibly true. Even a 'meh' version as a min viable product would be a brilliant way of showing that it's a good thing outside of 'theory' and possibly turn more people towards SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:27:23
Wow, you really don't get it do you. Think about what factors play into mining outside of power, and then consider what 20% power savings means if you pay $0.20/kwh or $0.02/kwh. It's really not rocket science.

I believe his point is that we shouldn't make it easier to circumvent the consensus process just because 'it's just a soft-fork'. It's a change to the Bitcoin core, and any change, soft or hard fork should be held to the same standard.

There are no bad or good reasons. The SegWit limit is 95%, Unlimited does not believe it is the right choice and are voting with hash power. This is how bitcoin works, and was intended to work. 
Checks and balances. Core pushed SegWit, there is enough community votes to block it. That's it.

"Miners will always get paid well" and after next halving, are you going to pay then for the transactions they don't collect fee for because 1 MB blocks can't hold enough transactions to make mining worth it while SegWit allows channels to siphon off 80% of fees?
Unless the answer is yes, you might be an idiot.

@_date: 2016-05-03 20:23:47
No. The administrator of the crypto email list where Satoshi posted the first white paper has published the public key used for Satoshis account. That's pretty solid evidence. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 21:53:47
He's not wrong in my opinion. A Bitcoin network that does not fulfill it's stated purpose and delivers transactions on per the network established times is not functional. When blocks are full, and it takes longer than 60 minutes (give or take block solve variance) or 6 blocks to get 6 confirmations, then the network no longer works. There are many reasons why this is true.

I agree, and if nothing else based on the principle that the Bitcoin community should never allow soft-forks to be something that we do on more of a 'whim' than hard-forks. It sets a terrible standard to have any change to the protocol have a weaker consensus. If we want to change something, let it be by the same standard, hard or soft.

Absolutely, but I also don't think there is any chance that a 'bloodbath' is going to happen. One of the positive side effects of centralization (as in, 80% of hash rate being in the hands of large mining operations), is that not a significant percentage of miners will drop out. If you run 10.000 TH/s+ you plan for these things ahead of time.

I'll dig for it, but I could swear there was a conversation where the admin of the crypto board stated that he had signed messages from key matching the public key for Satoshi from list-signup, and that he could verify them as the same as the one that posted the white paper. 
@_date: 2016-05-17 21:21:01
And, that still has absolutely nothing to do with block size decreasing, but is just a possible side effect of block time increasing so that if blocks are full, transaction time increases. See. Now you learned something.

@_date: 2016-05-17 22:03:52
But that's exactly what the public sees in the soft-fork vs. hard-fork debate. For soft fork the general view is that 'just do it' while hard fork all of a sudden require the consensus of the entire bitcoin community. Even if you don't agree, you have to admit that it seems that people are basically just shrugging their shoulders and agreeing to a soft-fork, while any talk of a hard-fork is much more contentious. 
My point is that just because something is scary, it shouldn't require a different type of democratic process than something that isn't.
@_date: 2016-05-17 21:57:55
No! We should NOT start easing our consensus mechanism based on what type of change is made. Are you really saying that we should just 'let the dev's do what they want' as long as it's 'just a soft-fork'? 
@_date: 2016-05-18 13:10:37
Because a fully variable fee structure with full blocks is not the intended functionality of the bitcoin network as per the whitepaper. Bitcoin was intentionally built to evolve through development, not perpetually increasing fees.

Hashing power did decrease when Bitcoin hit $200, so that's not really an argument. Shortly after though, the price of miners dropped as well and miners that doesn't pay power or have sub $0.05/KW power made up the shortfall, price recovered and hash rate increased again.

Anyone can be taken in a confidence scam. The main question is why he would allow this type of cloak and dagger scheme in the first place. Why not simply answer "just sign a public message with the Genesis key" which would have made the whole London travel thing moot.

Doesn't matter since you can't force a financial obligation onto someone. Any coin, at any time can fork and some have and no exchange has ever been forced to deliver it to their customers. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 06:10:33
It's not 'un-proven' at all. Their customers leave the claim to ETC at the door when they transfer the assets. A bank does not owe you YOUR $100 bill, just A $100 bill. 
You can't deposit a $100 bill with Picasso's signature and demand it back at a later date. You can only demand the value of your original deposit at the date of deposit. 
This isn't even a point of contention. It's just fact. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 03:30:11

You can't force a financial obligation upon someone else. Coinbase has zero responsibility to support a fork.

And I assume you would like to run a company where you have to account for EVERY possibility of any of your traded product forking at ANY time, and somehow being responsible for that? 
You can't push financial responsibility onto a third party. It's sort of elementary finance.
@_date: 2016-07-30 05:05:34

Betting 7k BTC for a 10% profit in -EV. Yeah, that's what we call a special kind of retarded. 
Of course, there is a pretty decent chance that every single 'whale' account is just another Dooglus alt. that is betting for PR and stealing from the 'investors' when he wins, and paying himself as an investor when he looses. 
If not, just rich fucktards that deserve the loss. 
As a former gambling addict myself I can pretty much guarantee that being 'an addict' is a dumb-ass excuse. No real gambler finds their fix in a -EV game without live opponents.

According to BFL They "are the reason hash rate has gone up" but then when you stop laughing you can take a look at ghash.io and Bitfury in general and realize they have shipped 10x the hash power in 4 months over What BFL has shipped in 2 years.

Yet again people fail to realize that ROI is conditional and not exact. With free power (dorm, office, solar etc.) Miners have a near unlimited life span. Stop making the mistake of calculating ROI for 100% of the community based on the basis of your own conditions.

I purchased as many BTC as I could on the SR panic. The fact that so many people didn't realize it was the final big block before mainstream adoption and massively positive to not have the "its for buying drugs" stamp boggles my mind.
@_date: 2013-09-30 18:10:51
This is a highly contested calculation of course. For example, PPC can be mined with ASIC and may deliver profitability longer than BTC and also help spread ASIC rate thus mitigating some of the power and breaking the calculations for diff increase. 
I'd say it's about 50/50 if you reach ROI @ $3k for a in-hand 60gh.
@_date: 2013-10-07 18:11:56
 Lace users still not seeing ROI either but technically correct.
@_date: 2013-09-25 17:06:25
Aaand you just made my point. It doesn't matter how powerful the miner is, only gh/$ and power draw. 
The fact is that for people with free or very low cost power a USB miner whose power draw is negligeable to the average consumer (1/10th of a lightbulb) will be "profitable" for a very very long time depending on how you look at it. 
Of course 2TH @ 600w will be far more profitable but that is simply because of more effective circuitry. 
I run around 480 GH/s @ 1500 w right now and at $0.07 kW/h price on power I forsee that being profitable well into 2014

Buying a 2nd gen ASIC is an obvious gamble. I personally think that diff will plateau and a ASIC at or under $5 GH has a solid chance of being very profitable.

Everyone needs to calm down on the diff increases. Sure, it will continue for the foreseeable future but nothing NEAR as fast as July-Oct. Next diff increase is likely to be less than 20% and then drop from there. Just look at the numbers. Genesisblock is WAY off in their calculations for anything past Nov 1st.
@_date: 2013-09-30 15:12:53

@_date: 2013-09-25 17:09:13
Another very good point. 99% of what we do outside of work has no ROI and if mining is an activity that someone enjoys, why should that always be a ROI game? 
One of the huge benefits of mining is that you don't have to go through an exchange to purchase BTC, and that mined coins are 100% anonymous until spent. 
There is also a good chance that alt currencies based on SHA256 will be profitable after BTC is not, just as SCRYPT currencies have become.

The entire point of why any manufacturing business cant offer BTC refunds is that NO ONE wants to carry any exposure to BTC price when they have to pay in USD/EURO for hardware. 
Would you want to be a business that accepts 100 BTC worth $10.000 for a product. Then, bitcoin rises to $250 and 'surprisingly' your customer wants a refund of 100 BTC . The problem is, you already converted the BTC to USD to pay for costs. 
TLDR; Until there is a complete bitcoin economy, carrying value in bitcoin is risky when businesses deal with currency exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-09-26 02:11:40
