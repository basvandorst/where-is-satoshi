Cheers. I’ll take a look at those. Other than that, let me know if you know of a good website or job board for finding those companies.
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:41:03
Is it? Are there any job openings for Bitcoin related companies in Switzerland?

No, the point was to BTFD. Buying the dip and HODLing are totally compatible.
@_date: 2018-09-23 22:51:44
Good point. I haven’t done it yet but now that i think about it - yeah. Why move the funds?

1. RBF
2. Proper fee optimization (manually) 
I was going to do what OP did but am now reconsidering.

Yes, great resource. If you want more, I saved this thread where people commented below with a whole bunch of great resources. That’s where I first found this one. I don’t know if the subject material of the thread is any good, but the comments are.
Also this for the Lightning Network:

Great post. Thanks for this. We just went over eltoo in yesterday’s Seoul Bitcoin meetup.
We’re going to try and come up with a better TL;DR though. ;)
@_date: 2018-05-27 00:00:17
Thank you, that's a great link. I actually had Jameson Lopp's page bookmarked. I'll remember to go through it. I hadn't seen the second one before.

I personally dislike this quote. It was true for Satoshi because he was busy working on the project. He literally didn't have time. Many of us \- we have time. I don't think it's necessarily our job to convince anyone, but to freely share information with people who are interested \(as well as correct misinformation and fight disinformation\) is important.
@_date: 2018-05-26 06:48:24
What does this post even have to do with Bitcoin? How has this thread not been deleted yet, already? This is r/cryptocurrency material...
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:38:03
YES I’ve been waiting for a good Bitcoin iOS app. Finally! Thanks for this! Been using GreenAddress - probably best other option but not really completely satisfying.
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:53:21
Downvoting you for a troll comment.   
1\) This thread is asking Bitcoin Educators for feedback. It wasn't created as a thread for non Bitcoin Educators to debate the merits of educating about Bitcoin.   
2\) The target audience is people who are already interested who came to learn about Bitcoin. So they already came and found it, now they want to learn. Your comment makes no sense. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:54:16
Thanks, I will reach out.
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:57:14
Thanks for sharing your perspectives. I upvoted you. 
I also wanted to mention that I wish your website could be more of a helpful resource. I see the name is Bitcoin Homework, but I honestly don't see a lot there about Bitcoin. It seems to have a strong slant towards altcoins.
@_date: 2018-05-20 01:37:15
Are all of these text? Or are any videos? 
I have limited time to read, but a lot more time to listen.
@_date: 2018-05-21 14:50:18
I loved this but also agree with the words in the clip so... no upvote from me!

It's a difficult task. You never know where you're being too vague...Here's ours, by u/RubenSomsen
Eltoo uses SIGHASH\_NOINPUT to enable Lightning Network channels where the latest state can always be published \(as opposed to penalty based invalidation\). It also simplifies multi\-user channels \(e.g. Lightning Channel Factories\).

I’m joining you in the downvote. That’s ridiculous.
Serious Bitcoiner tests are happening here: Don’t Trust. Verify.
@_date: 2018-06-27 10:49:51
They use Bitpay though - in case that matters to anyone. It does to me. I won’t use Bitpay.
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:38:53
Thanks. I actually do have that website bookmarked on a list of Bitcoin resources. Does it have particular leanings you could let me know about so I know what perspective it promotes?
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:27:41
That’s history, really. And I do give them props and respect for the ways they have had a positive impact for Bitcoin in the past.
I also recognize others who have played vital roles in Bitcoin’s early days of growth and success but who have since become attackers: Roger Ver, Mike Hearn, etc
Things are different today. Past actions don’t cover present wrongs, imo.
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:38:44
I was going to ask this, but thought this could be its own thread. I think some front end development in terms of UI would really speed up the usage of LN.
@_date: 2018-06-20 05:03:19
Thanks for sharing. I completely agree, and those reasons are also big factors into what got me interested in Bitcoin. 
But interestingly, I don’t think banks are really to blame when I think about my experiences more. Governments regulate the banks because they want to control the flow of money in and out of a country for taxes and other reasons. So I think that’s the real reason for the money transfer problems. But I could be wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:43:32
115 dead political candidates in Mexico? Do you have any link or reference for that? That’s nuts. I had no clue.
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:15:46
It’s not. The website is a for profit service for doing illustrations. This is essentially a promotion paid for by gifting Bitcoin illustrations.
Again, I’m fine with it. It’s clever - but let’s not pretend this isn’t a business promotion.
I’d like to know if they accept Bitcoin as payment for illustrations. That isn’t explicitly stated on the website, either.
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:50:15
Right. It’s interesting and I’ve heard this before. Some who support Bitcoin with potentially conflicting political views do not understand that the two conflict and are unwittingly speeding the dismantling of their politics.
At the same time, and in my case, that’s how it started with me, and Bitcoin has naturally pulled me further away from my former political leanings and helped me realize just how much further I can drift away from being supportive of some government.
I think Bitcoin can shake up political leanings for people who seek to understand it...
But then there will also always be speculators and people who *attempt to use Bitcoin in conjunction with their pro-government political views. 
It’s interesting to me, so that’s why I want to hear from others.
@_date: 2018-06-06 03:49:32
lol \- well that's the idea. Give icons, receive attention. Pretty good idea, and useful for the community. I might do that sometime in the future as well if I ever want to promote my website.
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:36:32
ELI5: 
Bitpay charges an extra fee to Bitcoin users as a way to incentivize use of BCH instead of Bitcoin on their system. 
Roger Ver has a stake in Bitpay as an investor and has presumably some influence over them. 
Ver is a Bitcoin attacker and BitPay’s success empowers him and his agenda. 
I won’t feed my money to them. I believe a successful BitPay is bad for Bitcoin, and that they will use any money, growth, or influence as weight against it.
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:38:47
What does this have to do with my post? 
Bitcoin is fringe. Correct. But if we Bitcoiners want it to be a widely adopted, it will (by definition of widespread) need to be mainstream. 
Not sure what you’re trying to get at, but you can’t have it both ways. If Bitcoin succeeds, it will be mainstream. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:41:38
Good catch. Why is this article here? There’s nothing about Bitcoin in the article at all.
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:05:54
Just thought I would link the Lightning Network Megathread here so it can continue to be found, and if it can be updated \- that would also be great.  
@_date: 2018-06-21 03:20:52
They said they hope to release for iOS in Q4 of 2018.
@_date: 2018-06-27 15:20:40
I certainly don’t judge anyone willing to use BitPay and you should not judge anyone for choosing not to. I see them as actively hostile to Bitcoin and choose not to support them. Our community is certainly big enough to be without them, imo.

**John Keilman of the** Chicago Tribune writes:
Captain Kirk might be able to discuss the properties of dilithium crystals and give directions to Rigel XII, but don’t ask him to explain [bitcoin](
“The concept is so, I guess the word is bizarre,” Kirk’s alter ego, William Shatner, said by phone Wednesday. “You have to blank your mind and say, ‘What is blockchain, again? How does mining operate, again?’ The concepts are really strange, and yet when you begin to grasp it, it makes sense.”
Shatner is the spokesman for Solar Alliance, a Vancouver\-based developer of alternative energy projects that announced plans to build a solar\-powered Bitcoin mining operation in an abandoned southern Illinois factory.
Bitcoin mining harnesses computer networks to validate and record transactions that use the virtual currency, a task for which “miners” are paid in bitcoin (a single unit was going for more than $6,200 Wednesday). The process requires huge amounts of electricity, and that’s where Solar Alliance CEO Jason Bak saw an opportunity.
He said Illinois’ policy of requiring utility companies to buy renewable energy made the project economically feasible. It also didn’t hurt that the mayor of Murphysboro, Will Stephens, offered the company a 165,000\-square\-foot former label\-making factory that has been vacant since 2004.
Bak said the project will involve the creation of a huge solar array on the factory’s 14\-acre parcel. The space inside the building will be leased to bitcoin mining companies, he said, with some reserved for a training center that will teach solar panel installation.
He hoped to have some tenants lined up by the end of the year, though he didn’t know when the solar array will be finished.
Stephens said his town of 8,000, perched just west of Carbondale, is in need of an economic boost. Some microbreweries and tourist ventures have opened, he said, “but we, like a lot of Middle America, have seen job losses because of a change in the worldwide economy.”
Virtual currencies have plenty of skeptics — famed investor [Warren Buffett]( recently referred to them as “probably rat poison squared” — but Stephens said he didn’t fear that the venture, which is supposed to be partially funded by a TIF district, would be a bust.
Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology, essentially a massive digital ledger on which transactions are securely recorded, is being adopted by all sorts of industries, he said, so a solar\-powered computing center could still be valuable even if cryptocurrencies fade.
“From my perspective, we’re going to have someone who will occupy a previously derelict property, and whatever development comes out of it will just make it more marketable if the project is not successful,” he said.
Shatner, who got involved with Solar Alliance after it installed the solar panels on his California home, said he might check out the mining operation in person once it’s operational.
“I’m in Chicago a lot, and I live in Kentucky part of the time,” he said. “I might very well do that. It’s an interesting idea to see it at work because … it’s so esoteric that it’s difficult to understand.”

Paging u/rubensomsen to this thread...
@_date: 2018-11-11 22:20:15


Of course, do whatever you want with the bitcoins you own. Huge congrats.
All I can say is that if it were me, I’d sell some and hodl most. That’s the smart way to go about it. I’d probably go 30% sell and 70% hodl. Enjoy your spoils and have a nest egg for the future.
@_date: 2018-07-08 15:20:22
Well done review, thanks.

That's awesome! Meanwhile, in South Korea, we're still waiting for Uber to exist. (Yeah, they tried to be here in the past and the Taxi unions would have none of that)

I still plan to put up my own node within the next couple days, but his post does make it seem like using LN is beyond me at this point in development. I can’t code and have minimal experience on Linux
I’m both excited about the future of Lightning and also impatient for it to arrive. 
I want professional commercial quality GUI for everything Bitcoin asap but feel a great end user experience is still a long way off.
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:31:22
There are a few listings although I can’t attest to how well they’re kept/updated or the quality of those meetups (as some may have turned into altcoin meetups).
I would search 4 places:
1. [Meetup.com]( 
2. [Eventbrite.com](
3. [Bitcoin Wiki Meetups listing](
4. [BitcoinTalk Meetups listings]( 
And if none of those work out for you, I recommend using meetup.com to start your own meetup. It’s fantastic having Bitcoiners around with similar interest and drive.
@_date: 2018-07-29 01:18:49
Thanks, I’ll do that and probably will report on my experiences as well, to compare.
And thanks for the article series. I appreciate the tests you ran, your persistence in trying to get over the hurdles, and your (seemingly) candid honesty about the results.
I look forward to comparing.
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:10:07
Questions like these are heaps better than the memes and price posts, imo. Personally I prefer anything even remotely technical as opposed to that other stuff. Even jf it’s super beginner.
But I do recommend r/BitcoinBeginners for any such questions. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:47:51
Done. Here’s my message: “You currently have “Bitcoin.com” listed as a Website 2 for Bitcoin. This info is incorrect. Bitcoin.com is a commercial, for-profit website which in no way pertaining to BTC the currency. That would be similar to listing CoinDesk as a Bitcoin website  because they provide Bitcoin news. 
Does Bitcoin.com show extensive and exclusive information about BTC? No. Does it provide info on how to download and run the Bitcoin Core software? No. It doesn’t.
Bitcoin.com is not a BTC website.
Please remove it.

Are they STILL working on it? To my knowledge, they still don't support Segwit. I'm happy to be proven wrong.

I feel like the top picture alone can be “New Trader” vs “Experienced Trader” - a before and after comparison. New on the left and experienced on the right.
