How would you advise if they asked BTC vs ETH vs LTC vs XRP? (asking)

I could be wrong, but I think he is trying to say for security purposes, although the part about a "non jail broken iPhone" has me flummoxed.

I think the fact that they will allow sales next month of bitcoin is a step in the right direction.  They may want to see how well that goes, measure the interest level and proceed accordingly.

I have not used shopify is escrow an option?

I guess this is what I was concerned about with regards to iPhones:

Umm, not bus rides.
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:40:54
won't the transaction fee cost more than the bus ride?  Won't the bus ride be over before the transaction is confirmed?

not bus rides.

Change to 5 year view and you will get an even bigger picture of how bitcoin has fallen out of favor.

Enjoy the 2+ year wait, putting my money to better use.

and the price spiked in correlation with the google searches 
Now that there is no interest, do not expect a public spike any time soon.
This was the part of the thread in which all of this is irrelevant which you seem to forget:

Not true.

Actually that was just a FOMO post, the original post was more spot on.  There's the view from inside the BTC community which you 2 are circle jerking around, and there is a view the OP has stated from the real world outside of the BTC community.  If you were to ask the general public, their response WOULD BE: 
"a scam / bubble that popped / technology to facilitate crime"

Which are irrelevant data points consider it is an ORDER OF MAGNITUDE lower than when it was at its peak, keep cheering with your poms poms, maybe somebody will hear you and care! /s

Google disagrees, do you understand what Google Trends represents?
@_date: 2018-04-11 03:39:26
Bitcoin does not have an annual march madness event so that argument is dead in the water.
If people do not continue to search what is new with Bitcoin or what the price is, guess what?  You are not going to get an influx of new public money, NOBODY CARES.


Not a single person has refuted this statement yet, all you have done is gotten your poms poms out and cheered harder, it doesn't change the fact that NOBODY CARES and cannot hear you.
