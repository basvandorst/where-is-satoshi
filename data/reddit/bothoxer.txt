Yes, i’ve done it through the coinbase app using my phones camera.
EDIT: also tried it with my laptop camera but that camera sucks and the id verification was unreadable

in order to transfer btc from coinbase to gdax, you have to be verified. i’m trying to get verified to do that but it’s been an issue already for weeks.

It’s not just support though. I dislike them also because of the $30 transfer fee to send your BTC to another address. Also because they can’t verify my ID in a timely manner, etc etc.
I initially tried to get verified back when ripple was 0.22 and now it’s over $1.  It’s very frustrating

Thanks for the tips! My last effort was gonna be to go to the DMV and just get a brand new drivers license. idk how/if that’ll help but i’m about to do it.

I’m also waiting to be verified on gemini but it’s only been a 1 day wait with gemini so far so i still have more patience. my patience with coinbase is gone.

I’ve been trying to get my ID verified on coinbase/gdax so i can move all my stuff out of the coinbase wallet and into gdax and then to another exchange but of course it’s taking fooorrrrreeeevvvvvvveeeerrrrr. And when i manually input my address and other info, it tells me to try again in 1 day. Coinbase sucks ass. 
I’m also still waiting to be verified on gemini but that’s taking a long while. How long did it take you guys to get verified?
