No, really. Much of the reaction I saw on reddit and elsewhere might be best summed as "WTF!?" and the reactions weren't really favorable.
This kind of knee-jerk fantacism just drives people away from bitcoin by appearing too extremist.
And Apple probably loves it if people smash their iPhones. Each smashed phone can't be resold, which would minutely drive new phone sales.
The protest seemed a lot like punching yourself in the face to protest police brutality and dilutes your actual message. Sure, it's easy to think that a stunty protest like this gets people talking about Apple or bitcoin, but they're mainly talking about the weirdo punching himself in the face. The only people who get the message already know about bitcoin and the wallet app fiasco.
It would have been more effective to sell the phone and use the cash to start a decent site about Apple's fucked up profit model and walled garden policies.

This isn't even remotely true. You do not understand math or computer science. The only reason why ASICs are a thing in bitcoin is due to exploitable weaknesses in the bitcoin cryptographic hashing algorithm.
Do you even know what an ASIC actually is? It's not magic. It follows the same rules of math and computation. It's just a specialized computer program on a chip.
Read the linked wikipedia articles on NP completeness and complexity again. Not every problem can be solved faster by a customized ASIC, or any given piece of code.


Because - again - it's an applicable *weakness* in the bitcoin algorithm. Because it has started an arms race in bitcoin that leaves it vulnerable to larger, *centralized* concerns where the persons or organizations with the most money to throw at the problem get to mine the most coins, and control the majority of the network.
If bitcoin was created to fight centralization of wealth and power (ostensibly, it was) then this is a working weakness in the bitcoin system.
Good cryptosystems cannot be easily attacked with optimization.


The base encryption algorithm and peering network is not going to change without completely changing the nature of or trust in the network. A bitcoin "code fork" would basically be catastrophic to the perceived value and security of bitcoin, or it would create a new bitcoin that isn't actually bitcoin any more.


Because I've been studying this and watching for the past few years. Because I know computer science. Because I know people who are scientists and engineers and I discuss it with them. Because I know a lot of people who have been involved with bitcoin since the beginning.
Rough analogy: You don't have to do drugs to research them, study them or be aware of them. Sure, it can help sometimes, but if you're, say, studying heroin addiction, you don't have to do heroin to know it's addictive.
So, yeah, this conversation is done. You don't understand cryptography or NP complexity or completeness. You don't understand why it's not a good thing that ASICs and pools can be used to mine Bitcoin more easily.

Or I could have used one of those smashed iphones for my courier job instead ofleasing one from the company, and it could have fed me and paid my rent for a year or more.
And I live in Seattle, not Africa. And, yeah, I'm pretty fucking hungry. An iphone or any smartphone is a hell of a tool. It should not be destroyed so casually.
It's depressing to me to see that kind of waste when so many people go without. So many people could have used that phone for something. There could have been a kid in his neighborhood waiting to become a photographer, filmmaker, writer, coder or developer. Or maybe they could have used it to talk to family in far off places and see them with video chat. Or maybe they'd start making music.
There's all kinds of things someone can do with a used smartphone. Sure, I get it. Apple sucks. But smashing their hardware after its paid for is more likely to help them than harm them

IDGAF. The post is about making fun of some remote branch office banking hours in an age of online banking, while arguing that bitcoin is more convenient or something because it's all online or some shit and is somehow superior to said satellite office due to its limited business hours.
Yet bitcoin isn't at the moment insured, it isn't a very stable store of value, and if I needed to talk to someone about fraud or a problem with my stored value, there's no appeals process or protection, and I certainly can't pay my rent with it. Hell, I can't even buy a sandwich with it yet.

Ahahahaha, no. Not at all. The first to market often simply creates the market, then it fails spectacularly as someone brings out the new and improved version that fixes the bugs inherent in the first one.
This happened with basically everything you use today, from indoor plumbing to cars to bicycles to airplanes, and even the computer and internet.
The first portable MP3 player wasn't an iPod. iPod wasn't even the 2nd or 3rd, but like the 20th gen of that tech. One of the arguable firsts was the MP3Man. 11-ish low rate songs for like $400. Such a bargain.
The first non-kit personal computers weren't Apples or IBMs. Atari 2600/VCS wasn't the first home video game. The first portable tape deck wasn't the Sony Walkman at all, but portable cassette recorders that people used like Walkman.
This list of "not first" is so huge it's dizzying.

I don't think that this protest generated as much press as people think it did. Most of the response I saw was either in this sub, or on bitcoin blogs. I didn't see it on any major blogs or traditional media sources.
What little I did see from outside of the cryptocoin community was people basically pointing and laughing at those wacky bitcoiners.
For the same price of approx 2000 usd someone could have hired a professional publicist to write a press release and the iphones could have been jailbroken and donated individually or en masse to, say, a coders camp or a school or something, or even just a makerspace for hacking on or unit testing. There would likely be room in the budget left for hosting a site.
Simply smashing the phones and replacing them with android is kind of a damned if you do, damned if you don't bargain with the devil, anyway. At least they weren't Windows phones, I guess.

You didn't actually read my comment. I said I was pretty hungry, not "starving".
Someone like me could have used one of those phones *for work* instead of leasing one. I have three phones. One for personal use that I pay for as I need it, or use wifi. One is a disposable dumb phone I use for cheap voice and sms when I don't want to pay for data or carry a smartphone. And a leased iphone I use for work. I don't pay for work data, but I can't use it for personal email or net. My phone bill between my two personal phones is less than $30.
I can't afford to *not* have a phone due to the mobile and variable contract nature of my work.
When was the last time you even saw a payphone? They don't exist in metro Seattle. Library computer wait times can be *hours*. This is not an effective use of my time.
And I have something like 7 computers of varying vintages. All of them were free or cheap because I can fix computers that people don't want anymore.
And, yeah, no one becomes anything over night. I was talking about giving phones to fucking *kids* so they could screw around and learn shit and experiment. An iphone has not one, but two nice cameras. A decent mic, too. They make a shitton of iOs music apps, too.
So, yeah, an iPhone would be an awesome tool and toy for a kid who didn't have a computer, or camera or a lot of other things.
And I'm poor because I'm fighting my fucking way out of a legit disability that's kept me out of regular work for 3+ years.
I'm guessing from your comment you've probably never been actually poor.
I've been homeless before. Literally had to eat out of dumpsters or slept behind them. A phone and portable internet connection or computer is one of the most valuable things you can own and maintain because it grants you access to shit like finding shelter, or food, or work. Or a connection to the real world. Or searching for a job.
This is or was called the "digital divide" and it's real, and it even exists in the US. It's why the one laptop per child program was started, too.
I haven't been offline since 1986, and I don't intend to start now. My phones and phone bills *make* more money than they cost me. This is really basic personal economics in the modern world.
Telling someone they don't need a phone because they're poor is like telling them they don't need running water or to take showers or do laundry because they're luxuries they don't need.
Yeah, how about no. I've been down that road, and that's the road to poverty.

This isn't (profitably) true. There are altcoins (cryptosystems in general) designed to be resistant both to be easily (profitably) optimized, as well as more resistant to 51% attacks.
Sure, you *could* make ASICs or FPGAs to mine or attack optimization-resistant altcoins, but there's no reason to, because it wouldn't be more profitable than a commodity CPU *because they are resistant to optimization.*
There are many problems in the realm of computing that aren't easily optimized. This is how strong cryptography works in the first place, which is the fabric and nuts and bolts of all cryptocurrency.
If you say "no matter what is the task (sic)" you're telling me that you don't actually understand cryptography or computer science. See:
Your initial assertion is that there are no improvements to be made over bitcoin by any altcoins. My counter-argument is that there have been improvements. Difficulty or non-profitability for optimized ASIC/FPGA based mining rigs and pools that open the doors to centralization or 51% attacks *is* an improvement of security and value over bitcoin.
It's likely only a matter of time before bitcoin is successfully attacked and manipulated on a network-wide scale.
Whether or not these alternative coin systems (or bitcoin itself) have value is moot and orthogonal to the argument and your assertion that no improvements have or can be made over bitcoin.

But getting arrested is actually sacrifice and risk. It would have made more of a splash on the media, too.
But these are my opinions. I'm pretty sure this sub is pro free speech, so maybe you shouldn't tell me to "go talk about that" ostensibly somewhere else. I'm not telling people what to do, just that I disagree with what they did, and that it wasn't a very effective protest.

No, I never bought Bitcoin. It was an experiment for me. I was never on the line or emotionally invested.
I mined some of it early on, had some of it given to me back when it was much cheaper and earned a little more playing with faucets and satoshi dice and other early experiments.
I never had much, so it's not like it's a big deal. I'm just saying "I'm out. Cards are down. **Bitcoin is dead** ***to me***."
I never had that much confidence in it as a stable or convenient value - and I'm saying that as someone who used to play around with commodity futures (see footnote), which is where people have heart attacks and literally lose the farm.
I might buy it as a transfer vehicle, but then I might as well use Litecoin or Dogecoin or any alt that's stable enough for the time it takes to make a transfer.
I do think that there will always be bitcoin (likely hard forked) and altcoins and other truly decentralized, open source implementations of blockchain as a technology and network. That cat is out of the bag.
And I do think the technology as a concept will eventually change things, perhaps as much as the internet itself.
And I actually think that Satoshi also knew this, that it wasn't the Bitcoin network itself that would succeed as a currency or commodity that would change the world, but the idea of the blockchain and peered network as a transactional and ledgering system itself, that it would mutate and become a better thing.
I actually think that Satoshi designed the initial bitcoin network values to be deflationary specifically in order to drive the price up from low to high and keep them there briefly (a few years to a decade) to dangle a shiny carrot in front of early adopters in order to make it much more attractive and direct that attention to the blockchain itself, to get it out there.
Because if it didn't have that crazy ramp up from pennies per bitcoin to hundreds of dollars, likely not many people would have actually noticed Bitcoin's blockchain technology, or invested time/money into mining it or running nodes, or developing the core and aux code - because people probably would have just thought "Oh, yawn, another weird encrypted network scheme, yay."
Further, I think that Satoshi probably designed the network purposefully so that it wouldn't scale well beyond that initial hype, that it would self-destruct and have to be re-invented, because Satoshi is obviously very smart, and he would probably realize that the first adoption of it would be a gold rush and rife for attack and manipulation before it became a true service or protocol that was end-user friendly.
I would further suppose that Satoshi intentionally made the network to be vulnerable to DDoS and 51% attacks (as well as fragmentation via hard forks) to ensure that it was eventually abandoned or deprecated, to intentionally ensure that it, itself, would not survive.
But that the idea would now survive. Because of speculation and hype driving the initial attention, for free.
If so, it's brilliant, really. Make a bunch of people pay for your marketing and dev, and even generate a weird amount of spendable value for the early birds, then unleash one hell of a viral idea on the financial world. That's some Grade A super-hero/villain shit right there.
And at this point it's pretty obvious to me that Bitcoin itself (forked or not) isn't going to be the final implementation that the masses end up using as either a currency or a stored value commodity.
(Footnote: I've watched a bunch of hype rollercoasters before. This isn't my first rodeo. I used to tech for commodity traders and day traders back when getting data fresher than 10 minutes old cost a fuckton of money and a dedicated satellite dish. I used to help tune and program some pretty complicated arbitrage scripts for commodity futures.)

What he's saying has merit and value. The political squabbling over bitcoin and block size and who controls what and the random bias and censorship has effectively killed bitcoin dead in the water for me.
For whatever it's worth, I cashed out my tiny stash of bitcoin months ago and closed all accounts.
Granted, I pretty much knew that this was going to happen. A lot of the people who are really into bitcoin don't really understand how currencies, arbitrage and "free" markets usually work in the real world.

Most people with knowledge of btc *know* it's likely going to go back down to at least 300-500 USD for a number of reasons, the biggest of which is market manipulation just like any other forex/currency trading.
This isn't the first time btc has hit 1000 USD, and as far as I know the peak historical price of btc is around 1200. And that was in 2013. If you'd bought at that peak you'd still be 80% down or so today, over three years later.
I frankly think you'd be fucking nuts to buy in with a major investment right now near the historical peak. There is absolutely no evidence or historical record that it will go to 2000 USD in the next 12 months.
If I was you I would be selling some or all of what btc I have at this peak as arbitrage and using either precious metals or forex as an intermediate before rebuying btc at a lower price.
Gold right now is down and in a dip (and is well above the historical floor) but is, in my opinion, more likely to go back up in the near future.
BTC is most likely to be overvalued at the moment and will likely correct back to well below 1000. I personally wouldn't buy back in until it hit about 700.
The other thing to remember is that bitcoin is now permanently on the governmental/tax regulation radar in a way it wasn't in 2013. 
Some countries are starting to ban bitcoin sales, buying, trading and exchanges. Russia previously banned bitcoin entirely until recently changing that ruling.
Other countries (like the US as of September 2016) have declared it a fund, which now require it to be reported for taxes just like any other fund or investment device. Which can now unfortunately put you at risk of seizure of assets for weird crap like money laundering even if your accounting is accurate, especially once you break through 10k in assets. If you get your assets seized you get to pay for your own accountants and legal defenses in court to try to get it back, if ever.
TL;DR: You're high on speculators remorse for not buying it when it was low. You would *have* to be nuts to go all in when it was this close to the historical peak.
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:18:09

Right, this is what I was trying to say. The fabric of a blockchain has value as an idea and concept for a number of reasons that go far beyond bitcoin's numismatic or currency value.
The way I'm using the Tulip Craze is to describe the emotions and actions of people who... I don't know how to put this right - but perhaps "people who are simply wanting to board the hype train" will do.
There are a lot of easy parallels between how bitcoin is regarded and used by *some* people - not all - that are the same psychological motivations around things like modern trading markets from stocks to commodities to penny stocks, the rather dark and sordid history and beginnings of the stock market as we know it - and even the Tulip Craze, because they're all actually historically related.
Bitcoin less so in many ways because of the amount of decentralization and the intentional but generous deflationary structuring and more - but there are similarities in how people have treated bitcoin and the numerous altcoins.
And I can't help but remember other P2P technologies and services and how it never usually was the first popular and functioning version of that network that ended up catching on and winning out in the end.
And the idea of bitcoin is so politically powerful that it might, ah, startle the establishment into doing something drastic about it. Either subverting it or eliminating it or replacing it with their own controllable version.
So, don't get me wrong. I'm not underestimating bitcoin itself as a network, and I'm certainly not underestimating the broader impact of a blockchain and what it is.
If anything it's the sheer audacity of it that might make it vulnerable and a very large target to some rather powerful people.

Facebooks valuation has little to do with BTC's valuation. Conflating the two is a little weird. It's like trying to conflate the spot price of gold to the share price of a share of a single company. They aren't the same kind of instrument at all.
Bitcoin isn't a single entity, company or product. It can't even be compared to a hedge fund or investment portfolio.
And to say that anything - anything - will definitely be growing over any time frame is to willfully ignore history. The speculation around the Dutch tulip craze is often mentioned, and bitcoin suffers some of the same symptoms. It's value is mostly defined simply in the belief it has value. It really has no other fungible value.
Sure, it has some value as something functional that can transfer and transmit value in novel ways, but that's still pinned to the market value, which is still defined by people believing it has value.
Is it likely to go up over the next few years? Probably. But bitcoin has more weaknesses and vulnerable points than most people realize.
And most of the people who only subscribe to don't seem to realize that there's a hard fork looming on the horizon. A lot of people in the BTC are pissed about the very idea of segwit and lightning networks. Others don't like the idea of expanding the block size to the point that they're willing to call a majority vote fork an altcoin, even though they would technically be the minority altcoin in that case.
BTC is also now mired in long transmission times, low transmission rewards and drastically decreasing mining to reward costs. It has already diverged a long way from even trying to be a usable currency and not just an investment scheme that looks and behaves a lot like a pyramid scheme wrapped in the cloak of cryptocurrency.
What I'm saying is that anyone who uses and thinks in absolutist terms like "definitely" are probably over invested emotionally and it's clouding their view of history.
There's nothing certain in this universe. Except maybe entropy, physics and thermodynamics - and dying.

Hawking and other physicists have addressed this, and I'm going to mangle this:
The sphere of our observable universe is limited by both Special and General Relativity from where we are now on Earth.
That does not mean that the actual, entire *observable* universe ceases to exist outside of where we can see from here in this space or time frame.
A more comfortable way of thinking about this is that all we can see is one node or equidistant point in a larger space or fabric. One that we will never be able to see beyond, directly.
What we know as the Big Bang, expansion and cosmic background radiation may only be a local effect of the whole, actual universe.
I'm drastically over-simplifying this but this is where the idea of a multi-universe of a sea of foam or bubbles comes in, the idea of other universes. Those other "bubbles" are effectively the same special/general relativity bubbles around us from another point in space and time.
So, yes, what we can see is expanding. What we see really probably isn't everything. And it's not going to be a precise sphere or center, but it will be warped and weird, because that's what space-time do.

I'm not arguing against the fact that Facebook is overvalued, nor other tech companies.
But just because bitcoin is open source doesn't mean it's invulnerable or completely fair or that it's not being steered by vested interests who have their own interests and agendas in mind.
And mining doesn't actually create bitcoins value. Mining supports the network and offers a reward for processing and verifying blockchain transactions. That's all.
The real world value of bitcoin is based entirely on the belief that it has value. This is true of the US dollar, or even gold. Beyond that it has no intrinsic, fungible or spendable value either as a direct currency or as something that can be traded for other currencies. 
The only real intrinsic value bitcoin has is perhaps as a new accounting and ledger concept in the form of a blockchain. That has some scientific and intellectual property values.
But as a currency it's entirely supported by a belief system. If people (theoretically) stop trusting it or believing in it, it will crash as a currency just like anything else whether it's exotic tulips or shiny gold bricks.

You mean this part where you're trying to refute "Bitcoin is at an all time high, keep in mind that, historically, there should be a correction that follows" with a chart that you provided that shows that exact sell off correction and dive after a peak?
Yeah, I read that, and I'm wondering if you actually read your own post or chart, or if you even know what a correction is.
After every peak in that chart it's gone immediately to a lower price and taken months or years to eclipse it again. Whatever you're trying to say you're either completely wrong or not saying it well.
For fuck's sake, most of the "investment advice" (scare quotes entirely intentional) written in this sub sounds like a bunch of middle schoolers speculating about the theoretical value of MTG cards.

Well, individuals can lose keys to coins, but those keys can't hide from encryption-guessing forever. 
I'm guessing that it'll eventually it'll be computationally affordable enough to mine for lost keys in the chain.

Citation? It seems like we're debating semantics. It would be hard to argue from a classical physics standpoint that there isn't some kind of friction when moving through a fluid or gas at a given velocity.
The Space Shuttle and other returning space craft get, uh, warm on re-entry and require thermal protection. There are pictures of x-15 rocket planes where all leading edges are charred.
Anyway, the burrito will be placed into the tube fully cooked and heated. Any warming due to velocity would be a beneficial warming side effect. This is why I talk about a partial vacuum.
A carefully chosen partial vacuum plus enough velocity would allow for extremely high delivery speeds and acceptably low heating.
I'm actually more worried about deceleration. Burritos aren't known for their structural durability or resistance to high g-loading. When rapidly decelerated burritos tend to turn into taco salads or tostadas.

Well, that's basically the most disgusting comment I've seen on reddit today and bitcoin since I've been subscribed to it.
Edit: No, seriously. 15-16 upvotes for a cheap joke about polygamy, pandering and/or sexual trafficking and the ownership of women?
*This* is bitcoin evangelism? And y'all wonder why people think bitcoin is a scary fringe issue? Wise up and fly straight. The masses are coming. I'm probably part of the vanguard. If I'm just getting into it, expect slavering hordes of mainstreamers to follow.

Or maybe it's just that many people with a firm grasp of history realize we've already tried libertarianism. And it basically sucked diseased feral dog assholes for almost everyone except the very wealthy, with everyone else left to rot and pick rags.
Examples: "The Gilded Age" and the Industrial Revolution. Plutocracies like the Roman Empire. Major eras and segments of Chinese history. And many more.
The libertarian will often decry these examples with protests of "But that wasn't *pure* libertarianism! Of course it failed!" but pure libertarianism - like communism, perfect vacuums or islands - cannot actually exist outside of theoretical simulations.
Yet the purest examples of libertarianism are mainly wastelands of humanity ruled by oligarchies and plutocrats.
Practically worshiping selfish, emotionally damaged mental midget known as Ayn Rand doesn't help the libertarian cause much, either. 
Neither does the fact that most libertarians seem to be white, male and socially privileged who have no idea what it's like to actually be marginalized or ostracized by society. 
See Ron Paul's published comments about race, not to mention gender or reproductive rights. He's spouted some seriously poisonous bullshit. In fact the only thing I've ever heard him say that made sense was "Audit the Fed" but unfortunately that one good thing doesn't really outweigh the rest of the crazy shit he tends to say.

Emphasis is mine, obviously.
A wife isn't a "couple of those". Also, "taking a wife" is a fucked up old school patriarchal way of describing marriage that denotes ownership, especially when it's couple with the implied statement of when you're rich enough you can simply buy not just one wife but more than one.
There's nothing *not* objectifying about women in your joke. Objectifying means treating a human individual like an object, right?
Sorry to go politically correct all over your shit but that comment was gross, man. It's no way to talk about or think about human beings.
**And my main point is that comments like this can be seriously misconstrued by the corporate-controlled media that you literally want to buy multiple wives with your bitcoins.**
**I'm jumping all over you to let you know that this is very poor situational awareness and evangelism.**
Does that make sense? I'm aware that English might not be your primary language or something, so I'm trying to be extra clear.

You fail at words. Trolling doesn't just mean "saying controversial shit someone doesn't agree with on the internet" and it doesn't have anything to do with monsters under bridges.
Trolling is actually from Usenet, and it's a fishing term for setting out baited hooks and motoring back and forth over an area until someone bites for lulz.
It's worse. I actually believe in what I'm typing here. Yeah, I'm a fucking idealist and I like to fight about it.
I actually enjoy this, son. This is good times for me. It's not for the lulz.
Yeah, I used to beat up bullies who fucked with my friends, too. And occasionally I'd get my ass kicked for it.

TL;DR: "That wasn't *pure* libertarianism! It'll be better this time, I swear!"
I've been munching popcorn for a while.
Bitcoin seems like it's about to get flooded by (potentially or overtly criminally-minded) major market movers who are going to: 
A) Manipulate the shit out of the volatility (nothing new in forex trading, there, except for the very small cap and massive illiquidity) at the expense of little people.
or  
B) Break and/or manipulate the grid. Despite the cleverness of making legitimate mining (almost always) potentially more profitable than fraud, that doesn't mean you can't play the system against itself if you happen to have a lot of silicon in the game.
There's going to be a whole lot of noobs who are probably going to lose their shirts in the later stage bitcoin goldrush going on right now. There are people with way more arbitrage experience (and better algorithms!) that are going to manipulate the everlasting shit out of the BTC markets over the next year.
The built-in deflationary and decentralized aspects of bitcoin are probably going to only aid and abet this great fleecing of noobs.
Sure, if you're in it for the long haul and don't care about the cash value of BTC for the foreseeable future and you're just sitting on your low or lower-cost coins for as long as you can - you'll be fine and it'll probably get better. But the next year or two is going to see people getting absolutely hosed as more and more real-time trading and arbitrage happens.

I've had this idea for a while. If you transport the burritos with a large enough velocity in the right quantity of partial vacuum they'll heat themselves or keep warm en-route just from atmospheric friction.
The ideal burrito, of course, would be the perfectly cylindrical and foil-wrapped Mission-style super burrito. None of those silly wet burritos on a plate or skinny Taco Bell burritos. Just giant, warm, baby-sized burritos.

@_date: 2013-03-28 07:16:31
Hrm, at first I want to argue against that, because a burrito is nearly perfectly shaped for pneumatic tube delivery and it's not ridiculous at all to think of running partially evacuated tubes approximately 4-5" in diameter from the Mission District in San Francisco to every burrito delivery subscriber on the planet.
But now I'm thinking about drones with burritos mounted on hard points under the wings like so many bombs. I guess you could just strap JDAMs to them, open a window and set up some kind of net or soft capture device just inside or outside of your window.
This raises questions of burrito security though. It could be intercepted en route by some kind of mouth in the middle attack while falling ballistically to the delivery address.
But on the other hand burritos in a series of tubes could be at more risk from burrito collisions or routing problems. It would be terrible if you got your carne asada burrito all mashed up with a lengua or buche burrito, or if it was delivered to your neighbor instead.

I asked this question in a little while ago, basically asking about inflation or deflation due to attrition from lost/destroyed keys.
Bitcoin is so easily subdivided that we'd have to lose a massive amount of keys for it to have that much of an effect, even if Bitcoin's cash value surged to the projected target of about 100k USD per BTC.
You're still talking about fractions of fractions of USD pennies, and most of us don't get to use fractions of pennies already unless we happen to be a large bank or credit processor or gasoline retailing chain.

This is the true definition of the word "hacker".
To "hack" means to "hack away at a problem until hopefully optimally solved".
It actually dates back to the late 40s and early 50s from MIT and very early computing. (One citation: The book "Hackers" by Steven Levy.)
"Hacking" as defined above is basically the foundation of almost all programming, computer science and even most of maker/DIY culture whether it involves computers/computing/programming or other inventor/invention culture.
Hacking is not a bad or negative word.
And as Miner_Willer points out and defines, the people who break and take advantage of security measures are called "crackers". Crackers can be good or bad, just like penetration testers or pentesters.
With the same tools black hat crackers steal. White hat hacker/crackers/pentesters educate and strengthen.

While I want to believe the first image link (which needs citations or more formal white papers rather than unsupported statements), and I understand Bitcoin is designed to be more profitable being mined legitimately rather than brute-forced or hacked - the second link directly contradicts it as I read it:


Everything I read and understand about cryptography and quantum computing and locks/security in general is that all are solvable given time and processing power.
Basically you can't create completely and ultimately unhackable locks, ever, because we cannot predict the future, otherwise they could not behave as locks.
And as far as I understand it I've already seen fairly strong cryptography broken or brute-forced in my lifetime either due to fundamental weaknesses or brute force.
*Nothing* is entirely secure. Everything I've read about any/all encryption is that all may be all broken eventually.

I strive not to when I ask questions. No worries there.


I think that a smart and experienced insurance agent could take a good guess at it by considering the many ways coins could be lost just like paper or fiat coinage and mixing it with the various calamities that could make that happen from forgotten keys/passwords to disasters to sudden deaths.


This doesn't stand to reason as far as I know encryption and Moore's law, especially with quantum computing on the horizon.
No encryption is safe given the progression of technology.
There may be factors I can't extrapolate because I'm a noob to bitcoin, but if the network relies on today's encryption, at some point it stands to reason that computational power could become affordable enough to spoof or recover lost keys.
All locks can be cracked given the cycles and attempts.
Recovering lost keys that would be valid within the network itself might be problematic, but they can only be so problematic if any individual key has permanent value or permission to that value.

They've been doing this since the beginning of Wired.
CondeNaste basically bought/created Wired to bury and kill off much more anarchic and/or weird technology publications like Mondo2000, Phrack, 2600 and Blacklisted411. (This will always make me suspicious of reddit for obvious reasons.)
But since the beginning Wired has been less of a cutting edge technology magazine and much more of what basically amounts to a elitist lifestyle magazine aimed at the tech set in glossy day-glow pages.
The goddamn thing is basically a fashion magazine. I'm serious. For well over a decade it's been thick on advertisements from megacorps like Microsoft, Logitech, Dell, HP and so on and thin on any actual cutting edge technology reporting.
If you read about tech in Wired you can be sure it's at least 2 years old, non-emerging, non-disruptive and totally safe for and in favor of their corporate advertisers.
I miss Mondo2000. The future isn't what it used to be. BRB, putting on rollerblades so as to hack teh gibson more effectively.
