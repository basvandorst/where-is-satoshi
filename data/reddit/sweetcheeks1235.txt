It's what Bitcoin is trying to fight against. It's about not letting organizations with more power than common folk taking over and making decisions that use people's tax money against them. We pay the taxes for paychecks to people who use them to keep themselves in power.
In this case it's the hypocrisy of a promise made years ago to keep the internet free and more importantly equal. I suppose I posted it here more because of the mindset of this community than the actual relevance to currency.

Thank you. I love bitcoin and all, but let's not stoop down to the level of gross over-simplification in order to prove an inaccurate point. Yes, the US is in a lot of debt, but the US also makes a lot of money compared to other countries that have a lot of debt that don't make a lot of money. It's a problem, but saying "I'd rather just go with Bitcoin to be safe" is pretty stupid especially when the article just said that the price dropped 75% in a year. If the dollar dropped 75% in a year it would be fucking "Mad Max" out in the entire world.
Let's not post fear-mongering articles and stick with cool level headed discussions backed up with facts. 
Yes I realize the reference to Mad Max is a gross over simplification, so sue me :p

I could draw a man I suppose or an asexual person, but women sell better.

I would do that, but that would severely limit who could participate, unless the prize was like 100 BTC then no one would even bother.

So how would people crack that?

Wait I'm confused. You can sell items on MTGOX?

Although if you sold smaller amounts of bitcoin, maybe only mBTC it could be very profitable as most people wouldn't bother to take up a dispute for $5, although I have been wrong in the past.

If you don't mind working for an hour to earn 1/5th of a penny then they're pretty good. Honestly, I would just sell something to someone online for bitcoin to get a small amount to play with.

I feel this is more for Japan than the US. Pre-pubescent girls really aren't a hot ticket item here.

My point being with Beanie Babies is their value only came from scarcity and a "craze" for them, you couldn't buy a pizza with beanie babies though.
And what article?

Ok, I'll draw a 29 year old white male with a slight weight problem making $40,000 a year. That would make anyone want to buy Bitcoins!

Well I do a lot of drawings, I was thinking about creating a Bitcoin related character, maybe something like that could be fun. Sort of like a Carmen Sandiego, but for Bitcoin and Beatrix Bitcoin hides coins all over the internet for people to find. It sounds cheesy, but something I've been playing around with. I don't want to make it impossible to find since I can't afford that much, but if maybe there was a "treasure map" you had to buy for .001 bitcoins then all the proceeds from that would fuel the treasure chest. I'm not really looking to profit.

I got rid of my iphone for mostly the same reasons.
ME: Wow, I love this App.
Apple: Well I don't, so you can't have none.
Android: We don't mind...
