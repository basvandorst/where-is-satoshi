You simply don’t understand the underlying tech and how it’s evolving. If you think this is the peak you are vastly uninformed. You are going to see crypto decimate entire sectors. Banking? Gone. Insurance? Gone. ISPs? Gone. Online advertising? Gone. It’s going to power the IOT and enable the transition from a centralized infrastructure to a decentralized infrastructure. It’s going to be the biggest change to humanity since agriculture or contract law.

Oh I see your a supply side economist. What happens when you raise the price and no one wants to pay? You need to look at the study’s done of how people spend their UBI. The most popular expense is business investment, the next is increasing education quality, after that, quality in food. A surprising result, spending on vices remains the same.
And overall your missing the bigger picture, what is happening is that humanity is trending towards zero argonal cost. All these things that we produce are eventually going to hit a cost of zero. Consumers are evolving into prosumers and vertically integrated corporations are being replaced by access networks.- Zero marginal society by Jeremy Rifkin

Holy crap. Climate change is about managing oil depletion? What is going to happen to the coastal cities when Antarctica and Greenland melt? Could perhaps the global supply chains be disrupted? When the crops don’t grow from drought would we see mass migrations?
What happens when we see 120-150$ per barrel? The global economy slides into recession. Look at what followed those price spikes in 2007 and 2012.
Good to see your well educated on the issue. 1000$ per barrel. Lmao. The entire global economy would collapse because oil is in nearly everything we make through production to logistics.

Interesting. A state without control over its money. They aren’t going to be able to control anything. Good luck collecting taxes.

How do you reconcile free trade and his tariffs? Government hand outs to the agribusiness, what about those? Seems efficient and good for business  right? What do you think of him violating the emonulents clause from not divesting from his businesses? What about his lawyer and campaign manager? What happened to them again? Convicted of felonies?

@_date: 2019-02-08 22:53:50
.5 that’s not bad at all. I think I could live with that. That currently isn’t the reality though is it?
Take Jeff Bezos for example, at one point he was making 28 million a day. That’s over 1e10 a year. Then let’s divide that by an median salary here in America, say 35 000.
What’s that ratio?
Is that moral? Fuck. No.
And this goes to the heart of the matter. People don’t understand how big a billion is or how big the wealth gap is. Which,  if I understand your comment, is something that you don’t grasp either. (If that is what you think the ratio between the wealthy and the poor is, or you might be searching for a value of what I think is a fair gap in income inequality.)
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:24:16
Haha! So funny! Investing in this country’s future is so dumb! Let’s give tax breaks to the wealthy and fuck the planet beyond repair instead!

Transitioning to a combination of renewable energy. Things like windmills and solar are awesome because after they return their initial investment they continue to produce.
It is an investment in the country’s infrastructure.

Are you referring to abortion? The issue is about making sure a woman retains sovereignty over her own body.
If you want abortions to end, focus on providing people with a strong educational foundation. You are never ever going to get abortion made illegal, it would be less red meat for the wealthy to dangle in front of your nose.
Btw, what do you think of the child separation policy.

Comical, have you ever worked at a large corporation? They don’t invest if they don’t have to. Investment in the business takes away from bonus pools and share buybacks.
Do you think the oil and gas industries are going to abandon their trillion dollars of assets that process oil?
Businesses are subject to momentum. If you want it to change, you need to change public policy.

It doesn’t matter what the founding fathers envisioned. They are dead. We have large problems to solve now, like wealth inequality and climate change.
@_date: 2019-12-19 05:03:32
What your talking about is a speculative attack on the worlds current reserve currency. I don’t think you realize how painful a sudden transition like that can be.
How is Venezuela doing right now? Zimbabwe? The quality of life isn’t exactly high or comfortable. Corruption grows rampant.
If you have the banking sector suddenly collapse , the supply lines will collapse.
Think about logistic companies not being able to make payroll and groceries not being delivered.
