I am looking forward to this. I hope some retailers offer additional discounts for using bitcoin. Either way, I will be purchasing all holiday gifts using Bitcoin only.

I disagree. I buy bitcoin to spend it because I support it and where it is going.

Steve Case's response: I am intrigued with Bitcoin. Still early, still confusing, so it - like many new technologies - is hard to predict - but I suspect cryptocurrencies will emerge as a real force. So on my watch list. But not quite ready to jump in.

The FairTax rate after necessities is 23% and equal to the lowest current income tax bracket (15%) combined with employee payroll taxes (7.65%), both of which will be eliminated. Low income qualifies for a prebate:

I am just happy the CEO knows what Bitcoin is. The market will determine Bitcoin's future with Ebay/Paypal.

LaMont "Monte" Hamilton who is a psychic can see into the future. He predicts that Bitcoin will crash due to a well placed virus that affects the algorithm.

Come on!! The banking is not the future, the unbanked is the future. This panel is pro banking. "Pay money to get money" "Pay a premium to get your money now"... They clearly do not understand the potential of virtual currency and it's affect on banking.

I guess Steve Case is ready to jump into Bitcoin. I asked him about his thoughts on Bitcoin and his responses was "I am intrigued with Bitcoin. Still early, still confusing, so it - like many new technologies - is hard to predict - but I suspect cryptocurrencies will emerge as a real force. So on my watch list. But not quite ready to jump in."

With all the credit card hacking going (  ) on I prefer to spend BTC or cash. I add to BTC weekly and do a cost averaging so I am not too concerned about the crazy swings. I am in the black until price drops below $300. At that point will watch BTC spending more closely.  I am not concerned if the merchant exchanges btc for cash. At this early point in the game, I only do business who those businesses who accept BTC. I hope BTC adoption swings from ecom to the larger brick and mortar grocery stores.

Good point for thought. Fairtax does not tax income or capital gains, only taxed when you purchase something. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 18:35:02
That's why we need regulation to all exchanges. Too much shady stuff on all exchanges. Crap like this gives bitcoin a bad name. Let the down votes begin.
