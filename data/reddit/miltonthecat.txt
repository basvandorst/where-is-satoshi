I'm sorry but that's quite the bold assertion. Do you have any data to back that up?

The answer to poverty is education, and this man clearly hasn't read the literature. This is a classic Keynesian "Castle In The Air" investment (actually speculation might be a better word) - hoping that "some greater fool" will pay more for bitcoin later than he has now. Is that castle built on a firm foundation of value? Will bitcoin even exist in 30-40 years? Bitcoin is still too young and volatile to be sure, and even if it were a classic blue chip stock, a company that had been around for decades or even hundreds of years, he'd be insane to dump his entire portfolio into it. Even blue chips betray investors, as they did in the 80s. Even exciting new technology (like bitcoin) betrays investors, as it did during the .com boom and bust of the late 90s and early 2000s. THE KEY IS DIVERSIFICATION. OP is setting himself up to be a statistic - another man who lost everything because he gambled on the next hot thing and lost.
Don't follow in this man's footsteps. If you want to get rich, do it slowly, don't gamble it on digital currency. Your patience will be rewarded.

OP, you are making the biggest mistake of your life. You need to diversify, and you need to stop fucking around with credit cards. There are mountains of data to back me up on this. Read any book by John Bogle or A Random Walk Down Wall Street to see what I mean.
Diversification increases your returns in the long run, it doesn't lower them. The key is to have the proper mix of zero risk (savings), low risk (bonds), medium risk (corporate equities), and high risk (small cap stocks) investments for your age. As you get older, you reduce your risk by rebalancing your portfolio to a safer proportion of each asset type. You've gone all in with a single, risky asset. How do you know bitcoin will even exist when you're 55 or 65 years old? When you cash out, have you thought about the tax implications? Because there sure as shit ain't a 401k or IRA that will let you include bitcoin as part of your tax advantaged retirement plan.
 I have nothing against investing in bitcoin but it is an EXTREMELY volatile asset.  You shouldn't build bitcoin into your retirement portfolio until you have all your other bases covered. Cash your shit out, pay off those credit cards, go to and don't come back until you've read every post for the last 6 months.

Even if you had a PhD in Economics it would not help you predict the future, which is exactly what you're trying to do.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:02:15
Can you expand on this? I'm just starting to learn about economics and I'm genuinely curious what you mean.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:31:09
Fuck you, asshole. I see that some new Bitcoin thread has led you to dig up a one month old comment so you could talk shit to someone you don't even know. Does it make you feel like a man, Mr. Internet Tough Guy? I stand by what I said. Now piss off.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:43:48
Jealous? Sure. Wrong? Fuck no. This is his retirement plan we're talking about. You really think this madness can last forever?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:42:03
How is anything I said less correct now than it was a month ago? A lot of people like you were telling people to eat their words before the .com bust, the housing crisis, and the implosion of tulip mania back in 1637. I'll get rich slowly instead of gambling with my family's financial well being. Thanks for the advice though.

The recession only makes my point stronger. [Have you looked at the S&amp;P 500 lately]( The stock market has recovered to its pre-recession levels. Those of us who invest in broad-market index funds, who diversify, and who are in it for the long run are doing better than ever. Hell, smart investors only fortified their positions by buying good stock at cheap prices.
To illustrate my point, look at [this chart]( $10,000 invested in an index fund in 1993 turned into $30,000 in 2012, even when adjusted for inflation. And this is during a period in which we experience not one but TWO speculative bubbles and crashes, and ROI was essentially flat. Those who got swept up in speculation (.com stocks in the early part of the decade, real estate in the latter) got burned hard. Those who remained disciplined did just fine. It's all due to the miracle of compounding interest and the good principles of diversification.


Is Bitcoin not subject to inflation? Are you telling me that mining is not "creating duplicate bitcoins out of thin air"? To Bitcoin's credit, it should produce *remarkably* stable inflation rates. Inflation is not a bad thing, in fact it usually goes hand in hand with higher GDP and decreasing unemployment. The uncertainty produced by high inflation is what causes problems. 
[Have you looked at the U.S. inflation rate lately?]( It's hovering under 2 percent. Furthermore, due to the economic princiciple of the Circular Flow, every dollar of spending becomes a dollar of income for someone else. As prices increase, so do incomes and wages (eventually, the lag time is what hurts). Unfortunately, while Bitcoin could do wonders for stable inflation, the market treats Bitcoin *itself* as a speculative investment. What is the difference between the OP taking on 30,000 in credit card debt in the hope that "some greater fool" will pay more for those Bitcoins later, and a middle class American taking on a mortgage they can't afford in 2007, hoping the home will increase in value when "some greater fool" agrees to pay a larger sum for it? There is no difference.
Also, we clearly disagree on what is "doing the right thing". Doing the right thing is not stuffing your money under a mattress and watching it erode due to increases in CPI. Doing the right thing is putting your money to work for you so you can beat inflation and take advantage of compounding interest. It's not that difficult. It's not that dangerous. You just need to take a little initiative, read some books, and absorb some common sense financial advice. If you (the royal you) want to gamble your money, go to a casino. If you want to save for retirement, study up and make a real plan before it's too late.

Millions? Apple has **$135 BILLION IN CASH** just chilling out doing nothing. Their operating expenses are 17.69 billion a year. All of their customers could start boycotting tomorrow and they wouldn't run out of money for the next **seven years**. I can promise you, Apple and its shareholders do not give a single fuck about the Bitcoin community. What a pointless exercise a boycott would be.

You're absolutely right. However, this type of speculative growth is not sustainable. This bubble will pop. This is this guy's *retirement plan* we're talking about here - something that is supposed provide a stable source income when he can't work anymore. Let's call a spade a spade and be real: this isn't investing, it's gambling, plain and simple.
