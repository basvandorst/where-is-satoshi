Good point, crypto is the bubble. Bitcoins risk isn't being a bubble but being replaced. Unlikely right now with how many attacks it's resisted.

I think comparing it to a bubble is still fair, but the real comparison is the dotcom bubble. For awhile you could throw money at any dotcom (any shitcoin), but eventually the bubble bursts and all the dotcoms/coins that aren't good did/will crash. Out of the wreckage comes the good projects, which do end up changing the world quite a bit.

Yep this is exactly what I meant, thanks!

I think you're oversimplifying it at the cost of assuming very little of a lot of people. I think a lot of people just don't have the right sources. The journalists that don't confirm these stories well, however, you can call stupid.

I believe you just need to send it to your gemini bitcoin address. I would send it to gdax first (sign in to gdax, same account as coinbase). You can transfer your BTC to gdax for free, then gdax lets you withdraw for free as well. Therefore you can move it all for free. In gdax just click the "deposit" button, and choose "from coinbase account". Should transfer instantly. Then click "withdraw" and choose "BTC address", then enter in your gemini address. You'll need a gemini account. I don't have one right now so I can't tell you where to find your address there. Both times I've transferred from gdax it's been instant. I would recommend transferring to a wallet instead of an exchange unless you're thinking you may sell in the near future.

Thanks! I asked this question somewhere else and got a similar answer, but they recommended mycelium or gdax. Do any of those 2 or the ones you mentioned work? I'll look into the pros and cons of each, unless there's one you think is clearly worse and not worth looking at.

What did you dislike about green address? It's my first wallet (switched from coinbase) and I don't dislike it. I chose between a few I had researched.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:48:57
Quick question - are greenbits and greenaddress the same wallet? I know the same people make them both. Ie can I use either and my balance shows up on both?

It does if it's held for less than a year. With his strategy, you are likely holding for less than a year. 
Also if you were investing larger chunks than the example it could make a difference in the 0% vs 15% capital gains bracket.

I'd like to here one too. I was telling my brother about BTC recently and he liked the idea but found an article that mentioned the energy use, and I frankly didn't have a great answer for it. Maybe because it is a problem.
I think the counterarguments are:
1) There will always be people mining bitcoin 24/7. Power plans using excess energy is a nice fringe case, but I don't think that's the norm, especially because it would require not mining bitcoin during peak hours. However, maybe power plants sell off their excess energy to bitcoin farms for super cheap. That way they are incentivized to only mine during non-peak hours.
2) It's significantly easier to quantify the energy bitcoin uses compared to a credit card company. Andreas listed a ton more things to keep track of (buildings, fraud centers, trucks, etc). So it's hard to compare them, and I don't think a study / true comparison has actually been made yet. Would be interesting for someone to try to calculate the amount of energy a credit card transaction takes.

Awesome talk! Congrats on your Runescape story leading to bitcoin instead of getting hacked as so many runescape stories end. :P
I currently have coinbase, but obviously have a goal of getting more secure as I invest more. I haven't invested much or decided that I want to keep putting $$ in, so a hardware wallet isn't worth it to me short-term. However, I do have a short-term goal of claiming what I receive from upcoming bitcoin forks and either holding it or cashing it in. What would be the least expensive way to do this, ideally that would also take me a step toward better security / owning my own key?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:31:57
Agreed. Also koala respect.

Technically it means it made it through the depression... but that's a smart ass answer. 9% isn't insane, agreed. His main point still holds though.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:50:43
Oh I agree with you, we need this change. I just don't want people to be in the mindset of "Segwit fixes everything! No more fixes needed!" It's an ongoing process. First Segwit, then LN, while trying to get as high adoption as possible as each feature is proven and tested.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:57:51
A lot of times when people say that they mean annually.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:44:35
You could also pay it off and just invest the 200/month you were spending. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:50:13
This is a better way to pay taxes. If you withdraw everything at once it could bring you into a higher income bracket. Withdrawing a bit each year is less likely to do that.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:47:46
I'm in favor of BTC over BCH but I think you just mistimed trades. You could have held either one and been better off. And either way, none of this has anything to do with the actual usefulness or tech of BTC or BCH....

I think the funniest thing about Dunning Kruger is that everyone uses it to justify why everyone else is stupid and never stops to try to apply it to themselves, even though they just learned that's probably what they're doing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:31:23
There are many two minute intervals where I can't say that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:29:16
I never said it was bad and I never said you pay a higher rate for all of your money. I just said the other way is better. If you're close to the next income bracket you will save $$ by withdrawing it yearly instead of all in one tax year, just like a retirement plan. Everything you said is definitely stuff people should know to understand my point, though it just seems like a weird comment.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:39:52
Sooo how can I found out what the upcoming forks are, and how I can actually access and sell the coins I receive from those forks?
Note: currently have coinbase, I know I need a hardware wallet eventually but frankly the value of my BTC right now doesn't make that worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:11:09
"hard" science. Rocks. Heheh.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:38:53
A concern I have: If everyone implement segwit, then the backlog is cleared. However, right now people are keeping their transaction at a minimum due to the high fees. If the fees are low again, then won't people start buying / selling (or even using) BTC more frequently, which would then increase the # of transactions again? It's like when they widen highways, but then traffic still sucks because then more people want to use the highways.
EDIT: Good responses overall, I just want to be clear that I'm not saying we shouldn't implement segwit. I just wanted to be realistic with how much it will help. I think segwit will help with transaction fees for the purposes being used right now (store of value / investment), but lightning network is what needs to succeed to use it as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:09:53
You should do that ASAP. The one coin won't matter much in the long run, but if it does crash you will be very remorseful that you did not pay off that debt.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:06:34
Power plants could charge less $$ for the energy during nonpeak. It would incentivize using that energy, and powerplants get all that wasted energy used.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:35:13
Yeah, this is what causes people to buy BCH thinking it's BTC. I don't care if you think your product is better, or is what the original product should have been. It's still a separate thing and trying to make people think you ARE bitcoin is far worse than just trying to make a product that you think is what bitcoin should be.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:19:24
When BTC goes sideways vs USD is when alts usually shine, since there's not much incentive to trade BTC. 
Some alts also outperform BTC or out-dip (real phrase) BTC. If you can find the ones that outperform, you can make more BTC. Right now it's popular to chase ICO's for this, but they're becoming increasingly more difficult to access for the general public, and often aren't liquefiable for awhile (if ever).
