What a terrible idea. Your answer is a counter-culture movement? We aren't there yet. If anything, this will reverse the agenda.
Who is project lead? 
Why are you bribing people with a money pool?
What is the collective mission?
Sit down peasant, there will be a time for this, but it is not right now. Too many people care about making a quick buck, not enough truly care about the innovative technology.
In a nicer way, back to the think tank. Get organized, do some study on historical movements and their outcome, THEN execute.

Every bit of terrible stuff pushing against bitcoin is only to deter the people from using and keep the rich, rich. They already have their hands in it and are manipulating the price. It's binary and artificial.
