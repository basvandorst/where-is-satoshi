You gonna follow up with why or just say false?
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:59:47
Sounds like you are asking for a lore, Hodl until bitcoin is currency and fiat is done. So basically never stop hodling.

That is going to be the easiest essay to write, there is sooooo much information out there.

Probably wouldn't have gotten robbed if it were the other way around, just sayin. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:16:14
Why not, they can get out of taxes... not saying that's what it should be used for but you can.

Don't take advice from Reddit but personally I buy half now and wait and see if it goes up or down to put in the other half.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:00:48
You and I have much different outlooks then, Its either a lesson leaned or a penny earned. Happy now
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:13:14
Correct me if i'm wrong but isn't a large part of cannonballs to look like a normal car so you don't get pulled over.

A panic sell app?
@_date: 2018-05-26 17:53:57
Is that safe for your bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-30 07:44:45
Get a divorce.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:07:53
This makes me want to sell lmao
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:28:48
Bitcoin is supposed to be the next currency so you wont have a need to sell it if it is what everyone uses.

Step 1 buy old pc from craigslist, step 2 say you found them on that hdd. I cant see how anyone could possibly know that you had them stored all along besides this Reddit post you made. or dont be greedy and take the safe option giving her half and hodl the rest of that till the 40 btc= 800k
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:46:45
Yup i put in 40$ a couple weeks ago now im $300 in

Gains are gains, just think of the countless amount of people losing money investing in "real investments".
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:30:09
That’s assuming the price stays static
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:19:50
Just patiently waiting for mens day... oh wait nobody celebrates that
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:24:35
Someone missed class yesterday... to fill you in the teacher taught about how you shouldn’t invest what you aren’t willing to lose
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:59:17
That's only if you consider anything with volatility a investment, if you put money into a risky thing in its infancy such as bitcoin looking to make a profit that is an investment. say for example you were to buy a home for the sole purpose of having a family and living in it and in 10 years it doubled in price, it wouldn't be an investment because your intent was not to gain profit and sell the home later on. point being real estate or fiat currency are a store of value (maybe not the best one). People could stop adopting bitcoin at anytime and you could lose your investment. this is coming from someone who is bullish on bitcoin.

I made it long enough ago where they didn’t force that
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:21:14
I probably should read up on it, but I was planning on holding it for 10+ years. That’s part of the reason I bought the ledger
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:27:59
I could sell and rebuy, but I don’t want to pay $100
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:59:42
That’s the plan, I’m just hoping it doesn’t auto detect or something and suspend it
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:22:40
Yea but what would happen with my existing bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:28:16
I worded that poorly, I bought the ledger to hold it for a long time. Not to evade taxes
