There is certainly no need to slow Bitcoin down. It is however possible that the functions of money are applied in different ways by different people, and that Bitcoin's general focus may be more applicable to some cases than others. Keeping an open mind to alternative currencies (notice, I do not mean typical 'alt coins') may be a reasonable thing to do.

Nothing to worry about, and both would deserve a little bonus, in my humble opinion.

it is better to fund people as they go, making small payments for what they have done, rather than funding everything based on a promise.
