Anyone can divide bitcoin beyond 8 decimal places right now, if they desired. If I run a dicing site I can allow people to bet .0000000000001 of a bitcoin, and I can give out a sub-satoshi faucet. They can only cash out up to 8th decimal place (because that's what the network allows) so the decimal place after that either gets rounded up or down. So you can bet 1/100 billionth of a bitcoin and that's exactly what that's worth, 1/100 billionth of a bitcoin. You're not making money out of thin air.
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:08:10
No, you're just further dividing 1 unit. There are still only 21 million units.

What are you even talking about... those exchanges don't need to cover their holdings. You acquire Tether, either from Bitfinex or the Tether site, and you deposit it into Polo, or the other exchanges that you mentioned. They don't need to have the USD equivalent since they didn't issue the Tether, nor are they allowing you to cash out the Tether into USD.
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:33:50
Are you willing to bet on that?
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:13:38
Yeah, since Kraken has a USD pair, you should be able to get actual USD once you trade your Tethers against it. Haven't used Kraken, so not sure how easy it is to get your USD out of there, but yes, they should obviously have all their customers' USD when people are swapping their Tether for it.
 &gt;Any exchange at anytime could decide to remove a tether pair. What would they do with the tethers. Someone somewhere is going to expect some USD. Is Bitfinex going to wire it across.
In this situation, people would have to move their Tether's to Tether's official site and hope that Tether gives them USD for it. Since Tether is still pegged to the US Dollar, I guess people are still able to do this without much hassle.


That doesn't really matter. These exchanges set up their legal disclaimers to make sure you know that you are trading cryptocurrencies and not money (example: see Polo's Terms of Use, section 2 paragraph 3). Yes, many users don't read the terms of service and think that USDT is USD, and they would be up in arms if it was discovered to be fraudulent. However, the exchanges would view Tether crashing in value simply as an altcoin crashing in value, and "too fucking bad for you for buying it", as that's how their legal disclaimers are worded.
It's important that you understand that Tether is issued from one source, and people bring them over to the exchanges. The exchange is not the counterparty to a trade involving Tether, it is another user, and that's pretty critical to understanding why these exchanges don't need to back up their Tethers. They are simply allowing users to trade altcoins amongst each other.

Yeah, you can margin long with bitcoin being held as collateral.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:40:33
That's the way I see it actually. Selling it is placing a bet against it, and it seems like a reckless thing to do, considering it was free. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:09:30
One man's ATH is another man's dip?
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:13:50
No, it's because they want your bitcoins on the cheap. If people just hold and not set up stop-losses/margin trade then the whales look like fucking idiots trying to get others to sell their bitcoins when they set up their sell walls (and lose THEIR bitcoins when they get bought up).
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:46:24
That's a great strategy *if* it goes lower and you are able to buy back in. No one knows where the bottom is, and you risk selling at the bottom. If BTC was absolutely destined to go down, then there is no reason why people would be buying it at the current price.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:15:05
Ok, but how are we going to transfer the funds? Fee is too costly for such a small amount.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:44:20
I'll make it simple for you since you are stuck on the fact that poker has far too much luck for the skill element in poker to ever make enough of an impact to continue playing rather than non-playing: Someone wants to bet on a coin flip. He's giving you odds by betting $15 on his side, while you only need to put $10 on your side. Fair flip: 50/50. He can get insanely lucky and win 10 coin flips in a row (there is uncertainty), but it's far better for you to play this proposition rather than not play, even if you are "up". I'm making it simple because you can't grasp the fact that people are willing to play games against others for money that are *this* advantageous to one of the sides. Maybe you haven't encountered it in poker, but I have seen it in backgammon (a dice game, luck is a big part of this game as well), as that is a game I have made a lot of money on by playing amateur players. Nevertheless it does exist in poker, and whether or not Phil Ivey is your idea of a "good player", there certainly are "good players" who can make off with your retiree's/casual player's money quite capably. That's the example I'm trying to illustrate for you, but you are too obtuse to grasp it. Once again, in these instances, it is better to play despite an element of uncertainty - which is the generalization you have made that is false.

This is a good comment. The points you raised are why I feel uneasy getting a hardware wallet. You gotta feel 100% sure that there's no funny business going on and I wouldn't be able to get that feeling by trusting that the device is secure. I can, however, create a wallet on an offline computer, memorize the seed and sign the transactions offline as well. That gives me the certainty that my coins are securely mine.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:21:41
You may have just jinxed it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:25:35
There are certain situations where you have a statistical advantage and therefore it is better to play. But negative sum games should be avoided and day-trading is a good example of a negative sum game.
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:15:19
Nah, I have figured it out quite capably as I myself am a professional advantage player. I play games and place bets that I can lose, but calculate the statistical upside and make an appropriate decision. You were the one who included poker as an example of how it's a good idea to GTFO when you were up, and I was explaining to you in many different ways that you were making a fallacy in doing so. I'll give you yet another example: the players are incredibly predictable, so you know how they will react to specific situations meaning that you benefit from that information. You consistently exploit that to your advantage. Bad idea to leave the table.
If you're a professional poker player and leaving sessions against fucking *retirees* when you're up a couple hundred dollars, you might want to give up the crayons/singing dinosaurs for a while and go back to the drawing board because you have some fundamentals to (re)learn.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:56:11
Exactly what I'm doing. So far I made over 30% of what I would've got if I just sold them straight up at .2 a piece and I still have my Bcash.

Unless you already have millions, then spending $10 a month on the lottery  could be considered extravagant as it is most likely over the kelly criterion (you'll face gambler's ruin before you win anything significant). Of course playing the lottery would need to be +EV before you even start making these considerations, which is not a likely occurrence.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:56:34
Exactly. If the bitcoins are real and can be withdrawn then they can do whatever they want. If they are not real, then their insolvency will be exposed as soon as people want to withdraw. They can short BTC to $100 but then people will buy it up and if they can't withdraw it, then people will see that that particular exchange is fraudulent and can't be taken seriously. That's the beautiful thing about BTC - you actually need to have some, or you will be exposed as a fraud if people score some cheap BTC that you sold at unrealistically low levels and they want to cash 'em out.

To be more precise, my *actual* left one.

Look, I don't need to keep coming up with different examples to try and convince you of the veracity my point if this is not a sticking point of yours. If you yourself can conceive of a situation where it's better to continue to play rather than not, then *I don't need to*. That's the fucking point.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:41:01
If bitcoin losing its value has no significant impact to how your financial situation looked before you got into it, then you shouldn't feel the need to keep "readjusting". It could grow to become 95% or more of your net worth (in my case it's about 97%). So what? If it goes to 0 you're no worse off than how you started. Sell if you really need the money, otherwise hodling is much stronger in my view.

Voluntary taxation is not advisable, no.
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:40:13
Nah, the point was that the generalization "certainty of a win is superior to the potential for a loss" is false. If you can think of an *any* example on your own to contradict this falsehood, then my work is done. What is of paramount importance is the falsehood gets contradicted, whether you accept one of my illustrations, or you come up with one on your own. You could've restricted this statement to BTC where maybe it could've held water, but it doesn't in the manner you presented it. Trying to hold on to both this generalization and the idea that there is such a thing as a "professional poker player" (the generalization being true negates the existence of a professional poker player) is the height of folly.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:06:53
Don't see how anyone would agree to this proposal. There could be good reasons as to why bitcoins aren't moved for 20+ years (or any arbitrary number you want to use).
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:17:40
Certainty is not always superior to uncertainty. What you are not considering is the expected value of a decision. We can use that poker example you gave. If you were significantly better than the other players at the table, then it is a bad decision to leave the table even if you are up as you are likely to win even more if you continue playing. Yes, you can still lose, but in the long run those chips that belong to the inferior players will make its way to your side of the table.
Another example: you can look at gambling from a casino's perspective. They can lose money, but they're not going to call it quits after they win a few million off some degenerate high roller. It is advantageous for them to keep the games running, despite that element of uncertainty. They have positive expectation.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:12:21
Poker is a skill game, and there are clear situations where continuing to play is undoubtedly better than not playing. Yes, the skill differences can be that big. Just imagine if Phil Ivey sat down at your table. You think he would get up and leave after winning a few hundred dollars from the retirees and casual players basically handing him money up to this point? No, he's not going to cut off the hand that feeds him. The chips that belong to the inferior players will make its way to his side of the table, like I said. Maybe it will take some time, but that's why I said "in the long run". It's a +EV decision. It's more likely that he makes money than not, all while maintaining that there is still an inextricable element of uncertainty, though that can trivialized given enough of a skill difference and a long enough session.
With bitcoin it is obviously a much different situation because it's hard to assess whether or not holding it is +EV or -EV. You made a generalization that certainty is superior to uncertainty and included your example of poker. If you confined it to BTC, your point would be much stronger but you didn't confine it to BTC. I was debunking the generalization that you made.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:15:36
Should be pretty obvious he was talking about the % gain in the bitcoin price since that's what this topic was about.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:27:58
Yeah, to me it seems reckless selling these forked coins. It's taking a position against the coins, and considering that you don't know the extent of force behind them, I think it's a dangerous bet to make. I'm still holding all of my BCH, and will do the same for the 2x coins.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:19:41
I'll take the opposite side of the bet if you want. I'm happy to lose .0001 BTC to see it hit 8k.
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:26:32
Less than a year ago.
@_date: 2017-04-13 16:49:03
I looked at my deposit address and no funds have moved. I strongly doubt it is an intentional scam. But perhaps the owner died or got arrested. Anyways, it's the same result: lost bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:45:43
It's not a miracle that FUD couldn't take down Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:13:24
You can say this about any kind of bitcoin speculation, though. "You think bitcoin is going to 100k? I'll make you a deal, how about I give you a bitcoin for 50k?"
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:51:34
You're fucked unless they give it back to you.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:41:05
Yeah... generally it's a good idea not to get your bitcoins stolen.
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:49:04
1/1000000th of a BTC. So if BTC = $10k USD, then 1 bit = $0.01 USD.
@_date: 2018-12-04 08:03:04
Sure. It's silly to think that people are going to stop trading to make a point. Some traders make tons of money on a daily basis, and they're not going to stop because of some Reddit post. Because they haven't had any problems yet, they figure its worth the risk of keeping the funds on the exchange rather than missing out on potential profits. Your risk appetite may not be at this level, but don't expect others to entertain your concerns (especially not on a large scale).
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:25:06
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:34:54
You want to bet in USD or in the current-equivalent of BTC?
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:57:16
Depends on who you ask. Not all of us have $5 million lying around.
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:21:16
Can't afford to buy girls at this level.

I never said that ATHs couldn't be made up to that point. But right around the final one is made, then it would not be a good time to enter the crypto market.
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:10:56
Then $250K becomes the ATH, and his statement is still wrong.
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:29:57
I could do bitcoin equivalent. It would have to be escrowed, though. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 08:24:36
This is not an idea that will catch on.
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:18:21
Until a greater ATH cannot be made.
