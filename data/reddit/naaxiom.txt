this will be difficult when 'regulated' companies will be forced to ONLY accept whitelisted bitcoins (hence the collection of personal info) from places like coinbase and circle. think about it for a second, why would a bank be investing a 'competitor'? theyre not competitors, it's simply banksters 2.0.

The darkwallet team is made up of Bitcoiners very active in the scene and have given updates before on this very  subreddit. 
They said it will be released in "early 2014", and I am also anticipating updates, but I'm patiently waiting hoping that they are testing their wallet very intensely.
Even when they do release it, I will still be only using small amounts of btc with it, as anyone should with new wallet software. 
I believe that they have a public Github account you can track as well.

still, it's one hell of an alternative to the current system of low interest rates and quantitative easing, incentivizing actions such as drilling for oil in deep water, fracking for gas and destroying cities, manufacturing shit that people dont really need... 
the "waste" you're proposing will be offset by a deflationary currency that will incentivize SAVING rather than SPENDING. this means that people will only spend when they are SURE it will outperform the act of saving.
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:05:17
"The prevalent Keynesian doctrine holds that the more saving in an economy, the less spending for consumption, and the less spending, the fewer jobs.
It is time that an end be put to all these misconceptions. " - Walter Block, ["The Miser," Defending the Undefendable](

I did not just quote him, I included an entire chapter of a book that breaks down and criticizes all the arguments against hoarding. I believe this is a valuable addition to the discussion here.
And the important point you didn't read in the link is "The argument is plausible except for a crucial point that this Keynesian-inspired argument fails to take into account — the possibility of changes in prices." This is even easier to do nowadays with automatic price adjustment APIs. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:33:49
It was one example of one market, i'll give you that. But deflationary money is different with btc since you can quickly and easily adjust BTC prices, and subdivide to extremely small units. 
So all of the arguments against deflation and hoarding are based on fiat paper money that doesn't have a movable decimal point. 1 cent is the smallest unit and trading below that point is extremely difficult and in most cases impossible.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:25:23

"And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his names (666)."
Right hand or forehead = Smart phone or Google Glass
... First apple computer = $666
I love this narrative. I grew up reading the book of revelation many times (the most exciting book in the bible during boring church services), and Bitcoin has been on my mind as being the pre-cursor to the mark of the beast. I think if a one-world currency comes along that is attached to your identity, I may have to go crazy and be Christian again.

@_date: 2013-04-09 11:47:34
It all depends on what the market wants... 
If there really are next-to-no sellers of bitcoin, the price should spike like something we haven't seen before (even more crazy than the $100 rise in a week). Also, people will come up with other ways of attaining bitcoins, such as actually using the currency for exchanging goods and services, which will compound the rise in value in a much more broad sense.

I think it looks great, although the one thing I like about the current UI is the small font showing one's entire balance.

When sending transactions, there could be a way to automatically show the balance so that you're reminded of your amount.

one of the most attractive reasons for businesses moving to bitcoin is to NOT pay for shit like this.

Also, don't the coinbase app and coinjar app have full wallet functionality too?

Great post. Many here are definitely new to the exchange game and definitely could use more educating posts like this. 
That said, many here like the risk. Many here, especially myself, want to see the market play without rules for a while. It's a nice experiment we're witnessing here.

printing bitcoin vouchers is indeed a really cool feature.

The 2nd definition of "Fiat" is: an arbitrary order. 
Yes, Bitcoin is fiat.

I did the same thing last night. Ordered chinese food with bitcoin! (half price too, factoring in the time i bought the btc)

surveys are great for measuring what people-who-take-surveys think.

Bernanke said it. We're doomed.

Agreed. BTC market cap is far too small to reflect the most powerful currency in the world. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:38:27
yes. cash will do for local black market transactions, while btc will create and expand a global black market.

2430 CNY ($399) on BTCChina right now. I guess it is kinda accurate.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:47:56
aaaaand just like that mtgox is down?

let's start by making one thing clear: the stock market, the bitcoin market, or any market for that matter, IS NOT THE ECONOMY. they are markets, so you're getting a reflection of what's going on in the entire economy, not a detailed account of it.
second, bitcoin may really help you learn how to save money, because unlike modern currencies that are A.) inflationary (more money keeps getting printed, therefore lowering the value of every dollar consistently over time and making you want to spend now) and B.) controlled by central banks who keep interest rates VERY low (which makes people like you and me want to spend money rather than save, because you get more value out of spending now than saving because it is difficult to earn interest).
Bitcoin is the opposite of that. It must be noted, that point B is different now because there is high "interest" in bitcoin... however, any time this can change and the interest rate can fall to negative numbers if people want something different.

yay so all the libertarians can shout "yippie!" and while they play bitcoin catch!

society is going to finally have to solve the mathematical problem instead of just a legal one. this cat-and-mouse game will provide better services for us all.

Got a better idea?

in my experience, losing phones is easier than losing passwords.

hm, i don't know what happened, i havent had any such problems (they've emailed me about every change to my acct immediately). hopefully it will come to you soon. try emailing their support. 
other than that, once you sign up successfully, they have a good 2-step authentication... you should activate that for better security.

China Telekom is 1st in landline subscriptions, and 3rd in cellphone subscriptions in China. 
THIS. IS. HUGE.

That's it? no fun theory to even read about? C'mon if you're gonna put on a tinfoil hat, give it a story.

bitcoin.de is also always slightly more expensive (in euro)

if i wasn't clear enough, I wouldn't trade at Mt. Gox since they're hosted by the same Content Delivery Network as the US Department of Defense, Treasury, AND SEC.
look here...

can someone explain to me what the purpose of these constant domain changes are? i type in .org or .sx and it still leads me to .ac... how does this help?
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:19:12
We might as well use this to collect more chart sites. Any others?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:01:37

@_date: 2013-04-09 15:57:49
im quite sure bitcoin.de does that... hq service anyway
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:54:23
I don't think it's necessarily a "hit piece" ... the title might as well say, "i'm a pussy"
and bitcoins and seashells aren't really comparable. nearly every article talking about bitcoin in any "cautious" way always fails to recognize its higher utility of transfer/exchange.

Yeah I read the white paper without any crypto background, but the actual code....
@_date: 2013-04-20 11:30:45
so it is theoretically possible that the blockchain + mining may have a hidden agenda? (my crypto-knowledge is slim) 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:25:20
if there's something else you're looking for, or if you need anything in the future, let me know!
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:59:23
Bitcoin.de as well... first time since... ever.

i love singapore. was there earlier this year and am so happy that there's a bitcoin conference there. the fullerton hotel is absolutely beautiful, and there is no shortage of what to do. i recommend taking a cab anywhere that's not in walking distance, as they are very cheap and there are cab stalls everywhere. Haji Lane is a great district with amazing food of all kinds, and if you're feeling like you want a taste of authentic singapore, try out the Tiong Bahru Market Food Centre. Here's a good short blog post that I followed much of while I was there.
