Anyone holding BTC Coinbase on 08/01 was credited an equal amount of BCH today.

He did gay stuff for Bitcoin.

I'm experiencing the same problem, only I used instant buy. The transaction has completed and my dashboard reflects the buy, but when I click into my wallet the new BTC is not there. I've never experienced this before.

They've disabled BCH sells - just tried to dump my free coin at $9,5000, but no go.

Coinbase just hit $19.3k - this is surreal.

It's an effective method.

An easy and relatively secure option would be a hardware wallet. From what I've read either the Trezor or Ledger Nano S are good options. The Trezor goes for €89 on their website and the Nano S is a little bit cheaper at €58. I recently ordered a Nano S myself, but it won't be shipping until early September given the recent demand.

I've been thinking about dumping my ETH and LTC for BTC for the last two weeks... If I only pulled the trigger then.

Thank you. Like I said, it was likely a dumb question.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:30:34
Indeed I did.

From what I understand there are safeguards in place to recover your coins in the event your hardware wallet is lost or stolen. I also don't trust myself to securely manage a wallet on my PC, since it's more susceptible to being hacked than an offline device I keep in my safe. Regardless of which wallet you choose, HODL!

Should I buy more BTC now before potential $5k? Or should I, as always, expect a dip after all this recent growth and wait it out?
@_date: 2017-09-19 22:16:16
So like... this is his thing?
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:54:59
Absolutely - I learned my lesson following the last hard fork and now hold my own  private keys.

Isn’t Coinbase making BCH available January 1st? I believe they released a statement some months ago, but I could be wrong. Who knows if they’ll follow through.

Looks like I’ll be taking a walk down to Newark Ave. later today.

I'm not too sure what happened to be honest. I just noticed that when I tried to add a payment method through the mobile app I didn't receive an alert about waiting 24 hours, so I kept trying until it eventually went through.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:16:30
I was having the same problem - after enough attempts on the mobile app my payment method was confirmed, and I was able to make a purchase this morning.
