It's not so different from than breaking into people's homes searching through their stuff for gold and silver

The only way to test it properly is on mainet with real money. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:25:34
No and I don't see the point. I get instant free transactions using an NFC card . No crypto can do that 
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:10:46
Yes so why would you spend crypto instead of cash ?
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:06:28
The emotional desire for 'full bitcoins' is holding back wide investment

Crypto can't replace cash until it's as fast (instant) and free to use.
I don't understand why people want to buy things like coffee with crypto when cash is instant and free
@_date: 2018-05-07 09:51:03
If they can work with the bugs and prove it can scale it could be huge
@_date: 2018-08-26 01:11:07
Forks are fine but Bitcoin Cash claims to be 'the real  Bitcoin' which it is not. Other alts like bitcoin gold , bitcoin candy , bitcoin interest, bitcoin private and all the rest do not do so .

lightning is vapourware and will never work.. /s
@_date: 2019-03-29 09:43:34
Why not sub bitcoin then sub satoshi mining rewards ?
@_date: 2018-10-11 03:04:13
The bright side is bcash always gets hit the worst 
@_date: 2018-10-27 07:08:07
That you can buy less than one bitcoin

The store of value and price history is why I don't want to spend it as a currency

Bitcoin = BTC
Bitcoin Core = BTCC 
@_date: 2019-08-09 22:50:08
Yes just pointed out that bitcoin core is btcc not btc
@_date: 2019-08-13 06:49:49
Could we be saying the same thing about satoshis in 10 years?
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:49:13
As measured by market cap? Dont see it happening
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:41:00
Because BCH relies on fraud to survive

0conf supporters dont understand the whole point of a blockchain. If there's no confirmation, it's not on the blockchain period
@_date: 2018-06-18 01:42:16
Does it accept bitcoin candy?
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:42:06
Noone knows
@_date: 2019-02-03 10:02:26
Iv noticed bcash fans start to call it 'Bitcoin BCH' as if they are trying to rebrand and  disassociate from their bad reputation
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:20:06
Buy high sell low
@_date: 2019-02-03 09:15:21
Whats bitcoin s,c,g?
@_date: 2019-02-03 09:39:50
Or sv, cash, gold ? 
@_date: 2019-04-16 05:41:32
BCH is pumping as a result of BSV's decline . It needs to be delisted next and for good reason
@_date: 2019-04-01 11:39:34
No bcash ��
@_date: 2019-04-16 05:39:45
This. Marketing and Selling something (bch) as something it's not (Bitcoin) is worse than claiming you are someone you  are not (Satoshi).
@_date: 2019-04-16 05:37:07
I have one more thing to say "BCH is not Bitcoin !"
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:29:17
Most exchanges have recognised ABC is now BCH . Premature and risky imo
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:47:21
Hopefully once people can sell their BCHABC and BCHSV they will sell them for BTC
@_date: 2018-11-23 01:28:25
1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshis . Block reward can be divisable ?
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:35:39
It's bch more than anything else 
@_date: 2018-11-28 09:58:50
Fear, uncertainty and doubt 
@_date: 2018-11-06 10:20:30
Hopefully not moving to bcash
@_date: 2018-11-13 01:28:07
If your after high risk, high reward sure... But personally I think the BCH hash war could be the death of it.
@_date: 2018-11-13 06:34:56
It's a good domain , the new fork.lol ? 
@_date: 2019-01-30 04:15:15

215% more profitable now !
@_date: 2018-07-30 08:12:49
Smart move. The infighting and desperation of bcash bag holders is getting worse as its economic viability declines

Hey here's an invoice for $1 Australian. I'll send it back if you like 
@_date: 2019-09-04 10:34:04
Most people already think Bitcoin is  "too expensive" and that they missed the boat. This is slowing down demand already and will likely get worse as the price increases .
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:54:13
Bitcoin needs to stop these forks stealing value from the Bitcoin brand. Especially BCASH which tries to claim it IS BTC
@_date: 2018-04-26 11:07:58
Bcash will end up like Bitconnect 
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:01:55
Bitcoin lightning wallet has a standalone SPV Bitcoin node with a fully functional built-in Lightning node
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:47:58
Sv has already shown the BCH scam for what it is   yet bcashers still think believe it will replace btc
@_date: 2018-12-23 01:23:34
Will the block reward ever half into fractions of a bitcoin ?
