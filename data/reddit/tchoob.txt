Regardless, they also push mutual funds. I'm not saying you should sell all your bitcoin... Just if you've made lots of money on it why not diversify a bit and put some into something safer, like an IRA? That way you have some earning you slow, steady interest that will build into millions by the time you're ready to retire, and you still have some bitcoin left in case it somehow ever makes you a billionaire?
You literally can't lose if you're smart with your money. But if you don't diversify your assets at all there's a chance this whole thing could crash and you'll be broke in ten years wishing you'd made smarter investments.

They invest in funds that are comprised of stocks and bonds, and it's for the purpose of long-term investments that will net you enough money to retire on. No one is cashing out their IRA's when they get big enough, they're compounding the interest and living off the dividends to give them a stable income each year.
I'm also invested in crypto to make money now but the two things really have nothing to do with each other. If you aren't doing both then you're doing it wrong, and by the time you're 70 the Lambos will have broken down and so will have you.

Y'know, I hope Bitcoin actually reaches a million dollars each. Because even then I know you'd find a way to spend $22million and then you'd be broke again.

Nah you're right actually, I shouldn't use terms like that. I thought about it after I submitted it and hoped no one would care.

Literally everyone reading this can tell how stupid and broke you're going to be.

There are a couple coins that aren't on the blockchain and address the issues most altcoins have. IOTA being the biggest one.
I don't think it's surprising that Microsoft has partnered with them. I'm interested to see where the technology is in ten years.

Dude has no idea what he's talking about, he thinks he's going to live off his Bitcoin without diversifying at all for the rest of his life.

If you don't take that money and turn it into something that you can live off of for the rest of your life you are. Because that's what IRAs are. It's retirement planning.

You literally started this conversation with financial advice you *stupid poo poo diaper*.

This is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard.

Alright, I guess you can just completely move the goalposts and pick an arbitrary number for what you consider to be rich.
If you seriously can't grasp the concept that rich children are born with familial assets and connections that 99.9% of people don't have, then I don't even know where to go with this.

Dynastic wealth is a myth across several generations, is that what you meant? Yeah, we know. But we have thousands of examples of uber rich people with uber rich beginnings. And you posted your comment in retaliation to someone saying that it's easier to be rich if you're born rich.

I don't think he meant it literally, just that some people are born in a position that makes it significantly easier than others to become billionaires. And there are many people that have inherited billions, not through strict capital, but by inheriting businesses.
I don't think any billionaires just have a billion in cash around. They have assets. Those assets are passed on.

Tell me about it. A friend in highschool was raving about bitcoin in like 2011 but we all just thought he was an idiot. I don't think they were even a dollar then...
