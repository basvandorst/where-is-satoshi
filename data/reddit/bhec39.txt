Roger says in the other sub he would never agree to this format. I suggest anyone who debates him from now on should insist on this format because it shows what a propagandist he is. He clearly is incapable of debating this way even if he had time to prepare.

I wouldn't have a problem with Coinbase closing accounts and lowering limits, but the least they should do is *explain* to a customer why they are taking such action. Not doing so is inexcusable!
@_date: 2015-12-28 05:28:10
@_date: 2015-12-28 06:29:02
They resolve it here because they *wouldn't* resolve it privately with the customer. The customer comes here and screams from the reddit rooftop and only *then* does his/her problem get resolved.

You can't be serious. I haven't used an ATM in years. If I need cash I grab some when I'm checking out of the grocery store using my debit card.
If you really want to know, I tried to use my Coinbase account to deposit btc since it's linked to ChangeTip but it wouldn't work. I needed to deposit funds at that moment so used my debit card. Was shocked by the fee. Don't get me wrong, I love ChangeTip but I will never do that again.  Lesson learned.
