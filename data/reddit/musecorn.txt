What happens if someone hacks bitcoin and changes 1 BTC = 1 BTC to 1 BTC = 0 BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:25:53
I understand that on Coinbase you don't directly own the bitcoins, you merely have access to them. Why is this bad? If you can withdraw them at any time what's the difference to a long-run investor?

I went from being a billionaire to being merely a 900 millionaire. What is that? That's not even a thing
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:21:58
Follow-up question.
I'd argue that it's not really diverse, since most cryptos are so tied together in their trends? Like if you look at the recent spike in bitcoin, eth and lite also follow suit. So wouldn't it stand to reason that a large event in bitcoin would just have an equal but less effect on the other ones?

Depends on the intention IMO. Long-run investors have no intention of cashing out and will take the opportunity to buy more. People who are just trying to ride the wave and make a quick buck will panic sell

I'm waiting on the Canada-based QuadrigaCX to verify me in order to buy, but they're over a week behind in their verification processing. I presumed paying the coinbase fees are lower than the lost money due to the time difference of &gt;1 week of waiting. Oh well
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:47:33
But you can buy any amount of it. You could buy $10 worth

Could you give an eli5 about futures? What is it, and what it means for Bitcoin to be adapted?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:45:24
Just delete the app. Stop checking. Honestly. You'll thank yourself in 6 months  not worth it to get panicked over every 15% dip

AFAIK, mining has become harder to get into nowadays because of operating and energy costs. As you increase your rig's computational power (increasing your return), you also increase the expenses in a) equipment cost, b) power consumption cost, and c) cooling. All these things work against you and it only becomes worth it at a very large scale.
I don't know about how to set it up, where to buy it or find info, but it's something to consider before you do it. How much will you have to drop on equipment good enough for proper mining? And how long will it take to make that money back, plus the energy cost for running it?

What a shocker 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:45:53
What do you mean won't be available? I thought on coinbase you get the purchase as soon as you see it in your wallet
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:43:13
The problem with coinbase is that you don't actually own any of your bitcoin, you just have access to it (see: Mt Gox).
Does their vault change this at all? or is it just provide more secure access to your funds

I should start telling people that when they sign up through me, I get a reward. And that when they get others to sign up through them, both he and I get a reward, and so on.
It's not a pyramid, it's an upside-down funnel

If someone has my wallet address (to send funds for instance) does that mean they can see my balance in that wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:41:42
Can you do my whole paychecks too?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:42:42
As for what it finally stabilizes at, what do you think that depends on? Does the settling price play a part, or is it only a result of other factors?
For example  time (it will settle 1 year/4 years/10 years from now), politics (x country recognizes it as a real currency), all 21M have been mined, or something  else or a mix of these factors?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:35:51
But think of the spike in the meme stock
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:44:36
That's rough
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:01:42
That's why I still haven't bought. I jumped on the wagon like everyone else in the last week, but I've been putting off buying since 9k because of I've taken the time doing research and waiting for dips.
I'm not going to pour a bunch of money because I'm not delusional, I know I missed the boat (this one at least) and using the logic "look how much it went up in X time!" to justify pouring in money in the present is wrong and counterproductive
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:40:09
That's why I offered to "manage" bitcoins of my girlfriend and my father when they said they were interested, because I'm not about to take the time to get them savvy. I strongly encouraged them to do the research themselves as I did, but I can only do so much.
Printed individual paper wallets, store them along with mine, told them if they feel like liquidating to let me know, and my "financial management" job is done lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:59:13
Ok interesting. How is that desirable though? Don't people generally not want anyone to be able to see how much money they have and their entire financial history?
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:15:15
My version is with credit card rewards. I get roughly ~$20 in cash back rewards each month, which have just been deposited back to my account. I think I know where that extra money will go from now on...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:45:15
It's huge bs and slimy. I want access to my money. They're forcing everyone to hold and freezing probably billions of dollars 
I'm transfering my funds to a different platform the second i can 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:11:49
Not only that but they rig up in Sweden or the like to reduce costs for equipment cooling
