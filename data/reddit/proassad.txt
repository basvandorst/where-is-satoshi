Alot of people like to deny this but....drugs play a huge role in bitcoins sucess. The tor market is a billion dollar business yes with a [B]( As we can see a year ago the FBI Seized $28.5 Million In Bitcoins, this is simply what they seized at that moment. And silkroad is not the only one. There are many other markets &amp; silkroad is back even after the FBI shut them down.

This is not true, most of the time they only pay half of the payment upfront then the other half once they arrive. The only reason they would leave them stranded is most likely due to the situation of running and everyone splits leaving people lost. Depending on where they come from the prices ranges from $7000-9000 from central america &amp; its gets cheaper the more north you are. I know this because i worked with DHS on figuring out the logistics as to how the cartels where involved in human smuggling. The reputation based system would never work, smuggling these people into the country is literally luck. There is zero guarantee you will make it.

Bitcoin would not be a good choice we need something like dogecoin that has 80+ billion supply so we dont have to deal with 0.00000991 to exchange.

I think its obvious that if you don't fit the look of a professional or somebody educated that has a way to legally obtain and travel with the money you wont have a problem. Or there going to think your a drug dealer if you dont fit the bill.
