Unfortunately the biggest offender for bloating the mempool is Coinbase, and they've publicly stated mutliple times that they support BCH over BTC so it's *not* in their best interest to support SegWit, they're intentionally delaying it to try and give BCH time to overtake BTC because of high BTC fees. They've added BCH support, and now more BCH trading pairs, before they've activated SegWit while smaller exchanges have added SegWit in under a week. We can't just assume companies will do what's right, so the community making noise about it is definitely a good thing.

He only talks about Bitcoin solving the problem of digital currency, which has obviously been solved for decades now. That never was Bitcoin's selling point. The *very first sentence* of the [original Bitcoin white paper]( tells you exactly the problem it solves, which is something that has never been solved before:


Bitcoin solves the problem of requiring a central authority to facilitate our digital financial transactions. Before Bitcoin, you couldn't send your money across the world electronically without requiring a central third party like a Bank or Western Union. Before Bitcoin, your government had every right to take your money if it wants (when the Great Depression happened, people went to the bank and got the response "sorry, your money's simply gone"). That's *100% impossible* with Bitcoin, nobody controls your funds because you are your own bank account. Bitcoin is a currency without a government backing it, without a bank, it's a global borderless currency that's 100% owned and controlled by the people. It's the most revolutionary thing to happen since the internet.

BCash's tech is fine, it's just Bitcoin with a bigger block. Of course it works fine. My problem is that it's actively trying to rebrand itself as *the* Bitcoin, the only Bitcoin. Litecoin was a fork of Bitcoin, they didn't call it Bitcoin Lite with a plan to try and eventually become the new Bitcoin so there's no controversy, forks are welcome and part of a healthy open source ecosystem. If BCash provides a tangible benefit that separates itself from Bitcoin it should be able to hold up on it's own name, instead it relies on piggybacking off the brand that Bitcoin has created. If Bcash was called something else like "Cashcoin" I really don't think anyone would be paying any attention to it, if it wants to be the most successful cryptocurrency it needs to earn it on it's own right like everyone else.
And of course you asked for reasons apart from Roger Ver but it's impossible to not mention how much I dislike him and don't want to support him. He went on national US television and publicly stated in an interview that insider trading shouldn't be a crime. Thay alone is enough to turn me  away.

Big blocks were never the problem, it was a hard fork that preached bigger and bigger blocks as the permanent answer that many had a problem with. SegWit enabled bigger blocks without a hard fork while remaining backwards-compatible with older versions of the software, so the original Bitcoin chain didn't have to split. SegWit also enabled the pathway for off-chain scaling solutions like Lightning Network which many believe is a more sustainable, permanent solution.
Bitcoin Cash wants bigger blocks and on-chain scaling to be the long-term solution. Bitcoin wants to enable bigger blocks in a backwards-compatible and more responsible manner, while also enabling a more sustainable long-term solution of off-chain scaling (which Satoshi himself described years ago as a possible solution).

If you use a tumbler I'd guess there is a decent chance that you will end up with coins that are linked to something illegal, as they're popular with darknetmarkets users. So even if your coins are clean you might still end up being involved with money laundering on the other end. For that reason I wouldn't recommend using a tumbler if you have legitimately acquired coins already, it would suck to end up with some coins links to a really dirty past and get caught up in something that you weren't even involved in.

This is what *you* think Bitcoin is all about , but it's not what the *creator* thinks. I don't see that anywhere in [the white paper]( the document that Satoshi used to introduce the world to Bitcoin. I do see this, which is the actual reason Bitcoin exists:


be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.


allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers
from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.   In
this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The
system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any
cooperating group of attacker nodes.
Bitcoin is about decentralized proof-of-trust, something that never existed before the blockchain. That is and always will be its value: the blockchain itself.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:33:46

Comparisons to Amazon and Walmart are completely invalid.
Bitcoin is a currency, is traded similar to securities, and can be used to launder money or evade taxes, which is why regulation in the US requires similar personal info verification as a bank or investment account. If you're not doing anything illegal then you shouldn't care, if you are then you shouldn't be using US-based companies.
Can you launder money using a Walmart account? No, so the government doesn't care if you are who you say you are with that account.
Like it or not, if we want to use BTC legally in the US we have to accept these regulations. If you're not in the US, then I'd avoid the US-based companies.

To clarify, the Bitcoin network doesn't *need* all of its miners and the massive power consumption that they create. Not every miner is really doing much, but because mining is a free market where anyone can compete for the block reward there are *way* more miners than necessary trying to get that reward. We could switch off half of the miners in the world right now and the network would still be secure.
That said, there will likely always be so many miners so the best solution is to have them use green energy, which is already very common since mining is only profitable if an operation has access to a cheap power source so many large-scale operations are using hydro power, wind power, or solar.

Because you don't want to support the massive banks that are too big to fail, get bailed out by taxpayers when they screw up, and pay off hundreds of corruption cases every year. Or maybe you don't want the banks to be able to just say "sorry, we don't have your money anymore" when you want to withdraw, which is exactly what happened in the Great Depression.

Mint actually mostly just does web scraping when an API isn't available, that's why you have to give them your username and password for web banking. Their servers will type in your credentials into the website, log in, and scrape transaction/balance info from the page. That's why if your bank's website changes Mint will be broken for a day or two until someone updates their scraping method. I'm not sure how they handle 2FA though

Circulating supply is entirely different. A lower price per coin doesn't necessarily mean a less valuable technology
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:37:03
Idk if that's really the best explanation tbh. There's a difference between the protocol being centralized, and the current state of the network being centralized. Nano's protocol is decentralized.
For example, when Satoshi first created BTC he was the only miner. Was BTC centralized? Not really, the current state of the network was centralized since technically his solo miner could decide to reject transactions. But the protocol of the network was still decentralized, it just needed more miners. 
Nano is similar, nothing in it's code dictates that 5 nodes decide what happens on the network. You could go set up a node right now and compete with them. XRP network is in a similar state.

depends. had you ever bought that coin in the past? capital gains are typically considered w/FIFO, so you may not be selling the coin you bought but one you bought awhile ago. did you ever trade it for another crypto? did you sell the coin within 1 year of purchasing it? which state do you live in? 
you really need to talk to a professional

I don't think any business should ever do that, as far as a business is concerned the BTC is just a payment option like credit cards, checks, or any other option. businesses exist to make money, not collect BTC. they should use payment services like BitPay that will instantly convert it back to USD (or whatever local currency) for them as to avoid any possible loss with fluctuating price and avoid any threat of being hacked

In the US, no. If you trade crypto for another crypto that's a taxable event. If you purchase BTC for $500, then a year later it's worth $1000 and you spend your BTC on something at a store you also pay capital gains then because you gained purchasing power with your BTC. The US tax laws on crypto are a serious issue atm treating it like property instead of currency.

in BTC, every transaction is a valid transaction. nothing is "spam", BTC is a free market open to everyone, no exceptions. rejecting transactions would go against some of BTC's core values. the solution is to improve the network itself so that it can handle any number of transactions, not try to dictate who is and who isn't spam

Well first off, it's totally open and available for anyone to read if they're interested via [the Bitcoin whitepaper](
But again, that same argument can be applied to the US government. Most people couldn't tell you off the top of their head exactly *why* the US government has its power, not many ppl can list off the many treaties and alliances and tariffs and taxes and various things that make our economy strong, the formula the federal reserve uses to determine how many notes to create each year, etc which in turn gives the USD power. I would guess less than 1/100 US citizens can tell you *why* the US is a world power, they just know that it *is* a power.  People are still happy relying on the government for their currency. Cryptocurrency is no different, if you *want* to understand it the information is all out there and the code is open to view, but it's not required to be able to use it.
An even more important point here is that just because you don't understand it, doesn't equate to it not being secure or true. Many people in the world smarter than you or I have tried their hardest to break Bitcoin, and it hasn't happened because it's not possible. You're using the internet right now, could you tell me how DNS, TCP/IP, and the many technologies that power it work? Probably not, but who cares? It works. Your bank accounts, credit cards, etc. all use the internet every day to facilitate their infrastructure, do you care if you know how that works when you swipe your credit card at Walmart?
There is one "weakness" to the Bitcoin network, which is a 51% network attack, but that's akin to say "the US government's only flaw is that a foreign government could wage war against us and destroy us". Of course it's technically a threat but we all assume it won't happen because it would be SO DIFFICULT to achieve.

Looking at only the price chart, yes it absolutely does. But the world is more aware of crypto than last time, there are more large companies dedicated to and invested in it now, there are more products close to maturity that utilize crypto and blockchain...the price chart is the only similarity, and previous prices are not the only factor that affects future prices. There are many other factors and those still look strong for the most part.

Same can be applied to cryptocurrencies. You trade your coins for goods and services using your computer or a mobile app. A community of exchanges and merchants respects it. Only difference is instead of one entity controlling it, it's backed by the most powerful decentralized network of trust in the world which itself is powered by individuals all around the world, and by mathematics that are 100% proven to work. Humans and government officials can lie and are susceptible to corruption and bribery, cryptography and mathematics are not.

First get some traditional, safer investments like a Wealthfront account, then go into crypto. A diversified portfolio is a safe portfolio.

satoshis *are* the units of Bitcoin, the only measurement that makes sense is to measure Bitcoin using its own native units of measurement. if a satoshi is too small, we can use multiples of it. for example
1 satoshi = 1 sat = 0.00000001 BTC
1 micro-bitcoin = 1 μBTC = 0.000001 BTC
1 milli-bitcoin = 1 mBTC = 0.001 BTC
if micro-bitcoin or milli-bitcoin names aren't user-friendly, we can use kilo-satoshi or something similar, but these conversations that come up every week or two about deciding on a new unit of measurement aren't necessary. we've had established units of measure for BTC for years now, and they're all based off of satoshis (for good reason)
@_date: 2019-09-20 18:17:41


not really, the BTC blockchain can't record amounts smaller than a satoshi (0.00000001 BTC). now LN channels are a different story, but LN isn't truly BTC, it's a layer on top

This is a false narrative that's been created by people other than Satoshi, which gained particular popularity during the market run up of late last year and early this year because Bitcoin transactions were getting incredibly expensive and slow due to massive congestion so ppl wanted to latch onto another justification for Bitcoin ownership and holding. Satoshi himself never mentioned "storage of value" or anything related to it anywhere in [the white paper]( or the original [forum post in which Satoshi introduce the world to Bitcoin]( Inflation is only mentioned once in the white paper, in reference to incentives for supporting the network moving away from block rewards to only transaction fees because there will be no more inflation after 21 million coins.
In every public facing discussion about Bitcoin from the creator himself it's always regarded as a electronic cash system, with the main purpose being able to securely facilitate transactions between users without a trusted third party that's susceptible to human corruption. That will always be the goal of Bitcoin, and it succeeds at that goal regardless of transaction times or fees. It's viability as a replacement for fiat may be weakened with higher fees and slower transactions, but it still accomplishes the initial goal successfully and always will.
From the white paper:


payments to be **sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution**. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
1. Introduction
Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as
trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.
**What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third party**. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers
from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In
this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The
system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any
cooperating group of attacker nodes.
And from the original forum post

it's really not debatable. LN maintains many of the ideals of Bitcoin, but a true BTC transaction can't contain less than a single satoshi as per the protocol, just as a 10 minute confirmation time is hard-wired into the BTC protocol
I'm a big fan of LN, but it's important to understand that they're different things and that LN is only one possible solution to scaling BTC and *not* part of the protocol

Proposing an alternative fork of BTC is *not* attacking the protocol, it's the protocol working as intended. BTC is OSS, anyone is free to fork and try new things. Hash rate and user adoption will decide which succeeds in a free market. Anyone is free to try a new idea, the market and miners are free to choose which they like most.

Every Bitcoin transaction is permanently public, the goal was never to avoid surveillance. The goal is to provide the option of controlling your  digital funds if you want without a middleman to facilitate transactions. Ppl are free to use custodial options, just as they're free to use cold stage. The important thing is they have the choice.

It's working fine, but we're not quite there yet with the user experience. You still have to know a bit about how LN works to use it. Once we reach the point where it's the equivalent experience of using a Venmo or PayPal account and the user doesn't know or care that it's using LN in the background, I expect adoption to skyrocket. Until then, it will be a slow crawl to getting vendors to accept it.

A lot of ppl don't trust themselves with storing private keys securely, it's still a relatively technical thing to do. I think crypto banks or other custodial offerings will become increasingly popular as crypto adoption with every day people grows. With crypto you have the option of having full ownership of your funds, but if you want the comfort of having a bank hold them that's fine too. The important difference is that you have the option

There are other ride share apps apart from Uber. Sidecar allows the driver to choose their own rate as opposed to Uber or Lyft where the company chooses the rate. That allows a Sidecar driver to set their price lower than other drivers to create competition, and the user can see the different prices when they're calling a ride. Personally when I've taken Sidecar it's been on average about half the price of an Uber
