Don't they use kilos though?

Twist: He's invested heavily in the currency and is trying to inflate it's value.

How is this in any way related to bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-27 20:52:54
:-D  I'm not so sure about that.

That's a terrible idea, bro.  Don't dump 2/3 of your money into bitcoin.  The reality is no one can tell you what it's going to do, even if most people are optimistic at the moment.  This would be an incredibly unwise decision, even if everyone agreed the price was going to soar tomorrow.
I bought around $2k in bitcoin around 2 years ago, and it's only now worth more than the average of what I bought it for.
If you end up needing that money in a week or a few months, you're risking losing a big chunk of it if the price drops when you end up needing it.  The price can fluctuate dramatically within hours or even minutes.
When you invest in something as volatile as bitcoin, you should only invest (read gamble) what you can afford to lose.  This is especially true because you've presumably never done it before.  There are an infinite number of factors that could impact the price, including large volume traders that can artificially impact or manipulate the price.  There have been things in the past where huge amounts of bitcoins were seized and subsequently auctioned off by the FBI, thereby impacting the price.  There have been very large, very reputable exchanges that went belly up over the years.  MTGOX is the obvious example, but I've had 2 smaller but (at the time) seemingly reputable exchanges shit the bed on me before getting mine into a safer place.
I would suggest putting a relatively small amount of money into bitcoin that you wouldn't miss or regret losing (I think my first purchase was around $100) and watching what happens to it.  That cost may be worth the learning experience.  Plus, if it grows, you can sell it and rebuy when the price dips again.  That way, you'll be increasing the amount of bitcoin you own without spending any more money.
Be sure to use a reputable exchange as well, like Coinbase or one of the other ones often recommended on these subs, but never make the mistake of fully trusting them.  You can keep your coins in cold storage if you plan to hold them for a long time.
You should also sub to just to get a sense of the overwhelming complexity of trying to predict what bitcoin will do and to get a sense of how wrong people can be with their predictions.  It's also good because people tend to be less invested in the *concept* of bitcoin and more interested in it its value.  That is, there is less enthusiasm and more analysis going on.
If you want to know what you *should* do with your money, wiki is probably a better bet than subs like this: 
["I have $X, what should I do with it?"](

Uh oh.  Good luck, man.
@_date: 2016-05-31 20:46:58
Yeah, gotta be careful, and you never know when the next one is going to shit the bed either.
@_date: 2016-05-31 20:15:43
Did this ever work out?  I used to use them a few years ago, but I thought they kind of died because of some controversy I can't remember.  I think they leaked data or something.
I still have my account, though and I'm wondering if they are still active.
@_date: 2016-05-31 21:00:30
I just did some googling, and it looks like some people had some luck withdrawing small increments of bitcoin, like 1 or less at a time.  I also read that they are sometimes on live chat in the middle of the night.  Like 2am. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 20:24:34
Did it work out?
@_date: 2016-05-31 20:37:14
Yeah, I kind of did the same.  I made a few hundred bucks via arbitrage a couple years ago between CampBX and Coinbase, then just held some coins in Coinbase after the craziness and let them sit there as they lost value for a while, haha.  Finally, they are worth more than the average of what I paid for them.
CampBX's price is super low (probably because no one trusts them), and I came here wondering if they were still somehow alive, but I guess that remains to be seen.  I remember they were the legit exchange for a while after some other one I used went to shit (not MTGOX, a smaller one I can't remember).
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:14:10
IIRC, they don't. I don't know much about it, but when I was researching VPNs, they were one of the few legit and affordable ones. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:18:50
This is cool, but I think the fear mongering and overt political statement in this video is a bit much. It also makes it seem like you *need* something to hide in order to use what they're offering.  Offering me anonymity is enough without having to entice me with the *allure* of feeling like an "outlaw".
@_date: 2016-05-31 20:27:38
I don't exactly remember what happened, but CampBX had some shady shit go down when the bank they were using closed their account or something.  They had a bunch of people's money and you couldn't withdrawal or anything for a while.  I *think* you were able to transfer bitcoin out or something, but I think some people's may have gotten frozen.
I got my bitcoin out, but I think it may have taken a while.  I don't really remember, because it was 2 years ago.
It was a big mess, and no one trusts them anymore.
Also, I think there was a data leak issue.

I guess that's what [this]( was all about...

It's kind of like insider trading, which is unethical and illegal.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:04:52
Reasons why your response is retarded:
1. Robert Murphy obviously has a personal interest in legalizing insider trading, not the altruistic one he is presenting.
2. It ignores the fact that "insider" knowledge could be made public so that the entire market - not just the insiders - responds accordingly.
3. It's fucking FOX.
4. It's obvious, shameless propaganda.
5. Robert Murphy actually makes the argument that **not** protecting people from fraud will make them safer.
6. The arguments in this video have exactly no relevance to the situation with bitfloor, in which people were intentionally kept in the dark and are now prevented from trading their coins.
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:15:41
If it's not money you can afford to lose, you shouldn't gamble with it. If it is, gamble away.

The funds I tried to withdrawal via ACH haven't come yet, but the p2p transfer I was worried about was returned.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:15:44
I just saw today that the P2P transfer was returned on the 21st
@_date: 2013-04-22 05:08:56
I'd like to expect that Bifloor will refund the money when they figure out how to, but I have no idea how or when that is going to happen.

Isn't there any way to track your phone down with it's gps?  I lost my android and found it using the Lookout Mobile Security app - it has both locate and "scream" functions.  Obviously, this app won't help you now, but isn't there some way to track it down? It has the hardware for it.
@_date: 2013-04-22 01:04:23
I'm in the same boat, and I also have funds that went out and were picked up in a p2p transfer earlier that day, before I heard the news.  Bitfloor doesn't have anything indicating the p2p transfer I made.
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:42:10
Doesn't defeat the purpose if you just want another payment option for your customers.

They say delivery should take 3-7 days and cashing could take like 2, don't they?  Seems like they are still on schedule.

I find bitcoin fascinating and useful for a number of reasons, but I have no interest in Anarcho-capitalism.  I do think belongs on the side panel of but I fail to see how belongs in the side panel of Bitcoins are a useful tool for anarcho-capitalists, but that is only one of myriad uses for the currency.

I just bought my first bitcoin yesterday and made my first 17 bucks trading with bitfloor today. I'm sad now.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:12:53
Not only libertarians are interested in bitcoin. Perhaps you don't understand the multitude of purposes it serves beyond your own political ends.
@_date: 2013-04-22 01:30:25
I did a p2p transfer **into** my Bitfloor account from my Capital One 360 account.  Bitfloor *picked it up*, but the USD hasn't shown up in my Bitfloor account at all.  So I couldn't initiate the ACH.  There was nothing to transfer.
Sorry about confusing language before.
